B0000A36J5|5.0|Absolutely amazing. Totally fantastic. Can't believe that somebody can make such a stunning movie. <BR>The only problem is that the men of Rohan, don't actually look anything like what the book describes them as. But that is a miner defect.
B000002U9W|4.0|In many ways ATOM HEART MOTHER is the most English album Pink Floyd made after the departure of Syd Barrett, and that is certainly a plus point. <BR>The second half of the album in particular benefits from this, Roger Waters &quot;If&quot; is another signpost on the way to DARK SIDE..., and THE WALL. Rick Wright's &quot;Summer '68&quot; is one of his finest solo songs, and a very underrated song. And then there's David Gilmour's &quot;Fat Old Sun&quot;, which is quite simply one of the band's finest efforts. It has an almost pastoral feel to it, and it evokes images in the English countryside. The final song on the album &quot;Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast&quot;, is essentially an instrumental, with one of the bands roadies talking over it about (yes you've guessed it!)his breakfast. It's quite an experimental track, but it works better than most of the experimental tracks on the previous years UMMAGUMMA album.<BR>The title track is essentially a collaboration between the band and Ron Geesin, and it's sounds like nothing else the band did. It's not perfect by any means, but without it we would probably never have gotten &quot;Echoes&quot;. Overall, the album is one of the bands more underrated efforts. Even the band don't rate it very high, but nobody's perfect.
B000099T2L|4.0|This has to have been the most anticipated album of the 21st century.  Everyone knew eventaully that Beyonce' would release a solo album, and how clever of the Knowles camp to let all three girls (and Solange) release solo albums so as not to make it seem strange that Beyonce's is the most capitalized.  I don't think Michelle's album or Kelly's album had appearances by the hottest names in music, although Kelly did have a then-relatively unknown Joe Budden.  Why is that??  :o/<br />Beyonce's album, though, does deliver and very well meets my expectations.  I did expect it to be good, and it really is.  I like how Beyonce' uses a lot of 70s inspirations and elements on this album, but can still pull it off for today's style.  She uses samples from Shuggie Otis, Donna Summer, and even the Chi-Lites on this album, but still makes it sound fresh and new.  You can definitely get your party on to some of the uptempo tracks on here, starting with \\"Crazy In Love\\", which blew up airwaves and the video circuit.  This song is nice, and of course can be incorporated with the \\"Uh Oh\\" dance.  LOL, but the song is enjoyable.  The next song, \\"Naughty Girl\\", is actually my favorite uptempo song.  Beyonce' really shines vocally on the upper-register notes in this song, and the harmony is on point.  She sounds good.<br />The midtempo songs fare well as well.  \\"Baby Boy\\", featuring a guest rap by overplayed Sean Paul, is very nice and very recognizable.  It's a very good listen that is extremely catchy.  The nice reggae feel of the song and the vocals flow nicely together.  \\"Me Myself and I\\" is a nice song as well, telling a story of a girl being on her own and loving it.  I'm sure most of us can relate to this song.<br />Beyonce's drives all of the ballads home.  One listen to this album's ballads, and you can tell that Beyonce' has reaally improved vocally.  Her voice is so clear and fluid that it grips you.  \\"Be With You\\", which sounds like a song that Amerie could have had on her album, is really nice and Beyonce's sounds good.  The thumping beat on \\"Yes\\" goes well with the vocals and the lyrics, even though it may sound like a Destiny's Child song.  \\"Signs\\" is by far my favorite song on the album.  This songs incorporates elements of the Zodiac sings along with a nice fluid harmony.  Missy Elliott did an excellent job in crafting this song, and puts her spin on it with the reversed lyrics that don't take away from Beyonce's singing.  \\"Speechless\\" is probably the best song vocally, and you can really hear Beyonce's improvement when she gets towards the end singing \\"yes\\" along with the background harmonies.  Excellent!!!  The classic \\"The Closer I Get to You\\" is beautifully remade by Beyonce' and Luther Vandross.  This song is getting a lot of airplay nationwide on the Top 40 and R&B stations, and the song is beautiful.  I admit that I was a bit shocked when I heard it, because Beyonce' and Luther compliment each other's voices well.  \\"Gift From Virgo\\" is beautiful.  It has a Jill Scott feel to it that makes you want to sing along. And the harmonies behind it are sickening!!!  And then you have the bonus track \\"Daddy\\", featuring Solange.  I don't know where Solange sang, but the song is still nice with excellent harmonies.  The lyrics, vocals, and harmonies are all on point here.<br />Of course, there are a few songs on here that I don't care for at all.  First of all, we all knew that \\"Dangerously In Love\\" was going to be on the album well before we even saw a tracklist.  When I saw \\"Dangerously In Love 2\\" as a title, I knew the song would be good....NOPE!!  It's just the same song from Destiny's Child's Survivor album with some added instrumentation in the background.  I was really looking forward to a new \\"Dangerously In Love\\" song, but I get the original.  And then \\"Hip Hop Star\\" really sucks in my opinion.  I don't think Beyonce's style of singing went along with the beat at all, and it got really annoying really quickly.  And then \\"That's How You Like It\\" was just downright irritating from the get-go.  I immediately skipped this one.  And then the interlude before \\"Gift From Virgo\\" was pointless, even though it was a nice effort.<br />I really think that this album is actually Grammy material, even though some of the above-mentioned songs do sound irritating.  I have to hand it to Beyonce':  this album is good.s How You Like It\\" was just downright irritating from the get-go.  I immediately skipped this one.  And then the interlude before \\"Gift From Virgo\\" was pointless, even though it was a nice effort.<br />I really think that this album is actually Grammy material, even though some of the above-mentioned songs do sound irritating.

B00009P1O0|5.0|Ah, the holy trinity: Tonight's the night, Zuma and On the Beach.  Zoned out, drugged out, hopeful and yet right on the brink of death.  On the Beach is the epitome of what I'd like to call 'beautiful loser' music, an 'it's all right' to everyone who's lost their way (that is all of us, right?)  Though often folky and gentle, the lyrics--especially on the latter half of the album, are particularly decimating.  The title track and Ambulance Blues are as harrowing as anything on Tonight's the night while seemingly pleasant songs.  What always gets me with this album is that it doesn't hit you over the head with all it's ugliness and pain, rather, all the agony is internal and personalized.  This to me feels like Young at his most personal and I must assume that's why this album has been unavailable for so long.<br />If this was the only album Neil Young ever made, it would have been enough to make him a legend.  So much of everything else he's done (which is still admittedly quite good), seems to obscure that.  I'm glad people now have a chance to hear Young at his very best.
0811729117|5.0|Otto Carius was one of the most successful Panzerkommandanten  ever to take a Tiger tank into battle, destroying some 150 tanks and being decorated with the Oakleaves to the Knights Cross. Stackpole are to be heartily congratulated for this cheap paperback edition of a long-out-print Fedorowicz classic, a classic of Eastern Front literature and a marvellous account of Panzer warfare.  When World War II broke out Carius had volunteered for 104th Infantry Placement Battalion in May of 1940. Following training, he was assigned to the 21st Panzer Regiment and experienced his first battle as a loader on a Panzer 38(t) during the &quot;Barbarossa&quot; operation in June of 1941. After about a year of war experience on the Eastern Front, Carius was accepted in an Officer Candidate Course and following its completion, was assigned to the 502nd Heavy Tank Battalion in April of 1943. Equipped with the new Tiger tanks, he was assigned as a tank commander to the 2nd Company of 502nd Tank Battalion. That summer, the 2nd Company was deployed to the Russian Leningrad Front and took part in several operations in that area. During that time, 502nd Tank Battalion was ordered to reinforce the front along with 11th SS Freiwillige Panzergrenadier Division &quot;Nordland&quot; at Narva Bridgehead. During one of his engagements, Carius destroyed four Soviet SU-85s and successfully withdrew without losses. In June of 1944, the company was transferred to Dunaburg (Daugavpils in Latvia) to defend the city from a concentrated Russian offensive. In the July of 1944, Russians outflanked the German defensive lines via the motorways west of Minsk and Borissov to Witebsk (same route was used by Germans in 1941). By using tanks in vast numbers, Soviets intended to divide the German occupied territory into small salients and then take port city of Riga. Since Riga is situated at the mouth of Dvina River, Dunaburg was an important strategic point for both Germans and Russians.<br /> On July 22 of 1944, 1st Lieutenant Otto Carius with his company of eight (early and mid production) Tigers advanced towards village of Malinava (northern suburb of Dunaburg) in order to halt the Russian advance. 1st Lieutenant Otto Carius and 1st Lieutenant Albert Kerscher (one of the most decorated commanders of sPzAbt 502) took a Kubelwagen in order to check if the village was already occupied by Russians. They discovered that village of Malinava was already occupied by the enemy. Carius recognized that the Russian tanks in the village were only advance troops waiting for the main force to arrive. He decided to recapture the village before the arrival of reinforcements. Carius returned to his company for briefing and explained his plan to take the village. He decided to attack the village using only two tanks because there was only one road leading to the village and rushing all of his Tigers would be dangerous. Six Tigers remained in the reserve while Carius and Kerscher's Tigers moved towards the village of Malinava. Speed was the essence of Carius' strategy and it was decisive to upset Russians and immobilize their tanks.<br />When Carius' Tiger No.217 was about to enter the village, two T-34/85 tanks were observed rotating their turrets. At this moment, Kerscher's Tiger No.213, which followed Carius at about 150m, fired and knocked them out. Also for the first time, Otto Carius encountered Russian's latest JS-1 (or possibly JS-2) heavy tank. Its silhouette was somewhat similar to the German King Tiger and Carius was confused at first but after hesitating a bit, he fired and JS-1 burst into flames. Afterwards, Otto Carius recalls that the entire battle did not last more than 20 minutes. In such a short time, Carius and Kerscher's Tigers knocked out 17 Russian tanks including the new JS-1. Although the Russians were attacked by suprise, Carius' quick and accurate recognition of the situation and the excellent tactics used were the main factors in the outcome. Carius' achievementat Malinava is perhaps as equally outstanding as Michael Wittmann's achievement at Villers-Bocage.<br />In November of 1943, Otto Carius destroyed 10 Soviet T-34/76 tanks at distances as close as 50 meters. In August of 1944, Otto Carius was transferred to Paderborn to the newly created schwere Panzerjager Abteilung 512 and received the command of the 2nd company. sPzJagAbt 512 was equipped with powerful Jagdtigers, armed with 128mm Pak 44 L/55 gun. Carius commanded the 2nd company, which was training at Senne Camp near Paderborn and at Dollersheim near Vienna. On March 8th of 1945, without finishing its training, 2nd company was directed to the frontline near Siegburg. It then took part in the defence of the River Rhine and eventually surrendered to the US Army on April 15th of 1945.<br />All of this is related in great detail with marvellous accounts of what it was to fight, live &amp; die in the Tiger tank. The book is completed with the reprinting of period newspaper articles, both in the orginal German and in translated form.<br />Highly recommended.at Malinava is perhaps as equally outstanding as Michael Wittmann's achievement at Villers-Bocage. <br />In November of 1943, Otto Carius destroyed 10 Soviet T-34/76 tanks at distances as close as 50 meters.

B0000BYM3K|5.0|BNW was a stunning return back to form for these long standing metal gods, but their latest release bangs the final nail in the coffin establishing them as THE best metal band ever. And they did it without much media exposure - thats real talent!!!!<br />DOD is a really good album overall, and not a weak track on sight. Maybe personal tastes might come in conflict with some of the songs but all the music is well written, beautifully played and stunningly sung.<br />As a final say - this album will not dissapoint any maiden fan or any true metal fans and is well worth the money. At least you are guaranteed to enjoy most of the tracks.
B00005JKZV|3.0|Grantefd you don;t have to put every minor detail, or stick to any minor detail at all, but in a movie adaptation you cannot expect people who've read a book to like the movie if you change absolutely EVERY major decision made, these weren't subtle changes they masacres of characters thay changed people who are amazingly humble and kind hearted (for a reason) to be sado-heartless idiots. Please don't make judgemens like &quot;you can't expect everything down to the minute detail to be the same&quot; if you donlt know that they changed everything. Still it was better than the first one, just.
B000000YG5|5.0|The question of who was the greater tenor sax player--Rollins or John Coltrane--continues even today. Let's look at it this way...in 1956, Coltrane was gaining prominence in Miles Davis' quintet, but he was far from being a great player. He did not yet have the technique to express the wild ideas in his brain. A year later, however, he went to play with Thelonious Monk's quartet, and the experience liberated him and his style. Only at that point could he truly hold his own against Rollins, who was already a mature player by 1956. Compared side by side, it seems Coltrane recorded more bona fide classic albums than Rollins, but I don't believe any of them are as consistently great as &quot;Saxophone Colossus&quot; (&quot;Giant Steps&quot; comes closest). Rollins' playing throughout the album is extraordinary, especially on the last number, &quot;Blue 7&quot;, a strange blues improvisation which features one of Max Roach's fiercest drum solos. Tommy Flanagan plays piano, and he is known to double the quality of any album he plays on. Doug Watkins plays the bass, and he's got a nice sense of swing...one wonders why he only solos on one tune--&quot;Moritat&quot;. But the star is Rollins, who is on fire from the word go. Clarity, coherence, speed, imagination and unpredictability are his weapons, and they make this probably the best saxophone record ever.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|This album is awesome. It has several types of Maiden sounds. I like it very much, and the songs are somewhat catchy. Its a good cd that you can listen to from beginning to end. I like how there aren't any songs that really...<br />As a guitar player, I would say this album has some ups and downs. First of all, people should stop hating Janick Gers (or whatever his name is). He is probably a more advanced guitar player than any of you. One thing about him that is annoying, is that all his solos sound the same. He also ruins the original Maiden lineup. I have a feeling though he will not be leaving the band anytime soon, so just deal with him being there. Even though he can sometimes be sloppy and boring, he is very good and can play pretty ... fast.<br />What (is bad) about this album is that it is just like all other albums. It is probably most like Brave New World. The riffs and solos are very similar. The song NO MORE LIES sounds just like Still Life (I think thats the name) on Piece of Mind. The songs just plain old sound like all of there other songs, which was a dissapointment. <br />Another thing, where did all their cool riffs go? They mostly just use that repeated clean tone and power chords with some whacko solos that are just like the others.<br />Even though I did complain a lot, I still do like the album. It has an overall good sound. I think anyone would like it, but real Maiden fans would probably find it dissapointing. <br />I recommend getting Number of the Beast instead (if you don't have it), since that is probably their best. Any Iron Maiden cd rules, except the X Factor and that other one in the same time period (I think its called like V something, I forgot cause I never wanted to buy or listen to it after the first time).<br />Just buy the album, it is good as a first, or as another to your collection!
B0000AGWJ7|3.0|i had the biggest crush possible on second heartbeat(old version).so i bought waking the fallen thinking the entire album would be as complete as the song.i was wrong!way mellower sound,plenty ofdesperate cries and too much girly songs.for old fans this must be the greatest album ever made but avenged sevenfold is definetly not a metal band!
B00004XOWM|5.0|I am so sick and tired of people getting all over Limp Bizket and saying how they sold out and are so bad.  Well then dont listen to them.  If you have listend to their previous records they have always incorporated a little rap and hip hop in their music. I belive that the reason people dont like this album is not for the fast that they rap a bit but more within the lyrics.  Fred focuses on the fact that he is such a bad ... and that may not sit well with some people.  This album however has some of the best songs Limp has ever done such as Livin iT Up, Hot Dog, My Way and Boiler amongst other greats. This is a must buy if you are ready to bang your head and get a little insane.
B00005JKZV|3.0|Right, I understand that making a bigshot hollywood movie out of something as amazing as The Lord of the Rings but come on changing a few things here and there for flow and all is fine but did they have to change absolutely everything. Is nothing sacred. The turned Faramir into a sadist b*stard and the ents don;t want to help them? what is going on here. The reason i bumped it up to 3 from 1 was because of Golum, he is the most amazing actor i have seen for a long time, absolutely brilliant performance.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|While not their greatest work, Dance of Death is a pretty solid Iron Maiden album.  The sound is very much along the lines of 'Somewhere in Time'; which is a comparitive plus if you were one of those who didn't like 'Fear of the Dark' (I won't even compare it to the non-Dickinson albums which were Maiden's lamest in my opinion).<br />The title track &quot;Dance of Death&quot; is a solid melodic rocker with numerous interesting tempo changes and some standout vocals.  &quot;Age of Innocence&quot; is a great piece with some of the best soloing on the album.  The first single to be released from this album is &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot;; and I'm happy to say that (despite being a good song), this is not the album's best by any means.  The album features 3 guitarists rather than the original 2 which does change the sound to some degree (giving it a rather layered feel similar at times to 7th Son of a 7th Son).  All in all, this is a true metal album; and worth shelling out $13 for.
0960191038|3.0|The Pyramid Principle aims to introduce the reader to a better way of communication. Is it successful. Here's the answer....<br />Based on the premise of a 'pyramid structure' to organise thoughts the basic format introduced is: <BR>Situation - what's the situation; Complication - what makes the situation less than the ideal and Answer - how we're going to fix it (and supporting evidence continuing down the pyramid structure.)<br />If you feel a natural affinity with the above then it's probably because we all naturally tend to work through a linear cause-effect-response framework.<br />The remainder of the book develops the above framework - including some rather poor choices for examples (GK Chesterton and pigs????). as the audience for this is likely to be more the business professional or college student the lack of research into more solid examples is frustrating and a poor effort from the editorial team behind the book.<br />Will this book make your ideas 'jump off the page and into the reader's mind' as the author suggests? That depends on how logical your flow of thought already is. If you examine the proposed structure and look for it in literature, songs, advertsing, etc - you'll find the Minto model pretty much a standard format of our communication already.<br />There would be no hesitation in recommending this book if you can find it at a reasonable price. I rummaged around a second hand bookstore and picked mine up for $12. 4 out of 5 based on that price.<br />At a local price of $100 it's a book of greater tragedy than Hamlet. You just cannot find that kind of value in a book that's better summarised in several pages and well constructed examples than what's in this publication. Given that I read the third edition and the section on presenting your report still seems to suggest typographics better suited to the '70s is shameful.
B00000IOSU|5.0|This album in my opinion is the best live album ever, this was my first sarah mclachlan album, i you like sarah's music you will love this album
B000002U94|5.0|NINE TONIGHT is another great live record by Bob Seger. It's not as great as LIVE BULLET, but it contains some tracks from NIGHT MOVES and STRANGER IN TOWN, which makes it quite excellent. Granted, &quot;Tryin' To Live My Life Without You&quot; is not a great expression of artistic freedom, but the title cut (from URBAN COWBOY) is. Most of the other songs are great, and this would be Seger's sixth great album in a row.
B000089RVX|5.0|I do not listen to this kind of music. I mainly listen to Rap/Hip-Hop and R&amp;B. I didn't know who Evanescence was two weeks ago. I heard people talking abou them. I bought the CD and it's my first Rock CD. It is so good. I do not listen to this music. But this CD is tight. If this CD is good enough to get me to listen to rock it is a must get.
B00005JKZV|5.0|There is absolutely nothing wrong with this dvd. It's just like the 1st one. I liked the special features like Sean Astin short movie was great and gollum's song was cool too. The making of the video game was great also. What I liked the most was the return of the king  preview I can't wait to see that movie. I am also waiting for the special edition of the two towers i am sure that that dvd will be great.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|Iron Maiden is back, and the fact that they are all pushing 50 or higher has not dulled their stamina or energy when performing live. I saw them at all 3 NY area shows this summer, and they simply RULED. This new album, however, doesn't even come close to &quot;ruling&quot;. It offers everything you'd expect from a Maiden album: good production, lots of changes, and a killer cover - but that's not enough. What lacks is a fresh reinvention of their sound...2000's &quot;Brave New World&quot; was right on the money after their &quot;wasted years&quot; with ex-frontman Blaze Bayley. Bruce and the boys sound like a cliche version of themsleves, as they recycle every familiar Maiden drum beat, guitar style, and compositional approach that they've used before. It's like Maiden by numbers, or Eddie's playbook. The best songs are &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot; and &quot;No More Lies&quot;, and even these tracks are mediocre at best, when held up to the legacy of Iron Maiden. By all means, if they can, they still should tour, but they really must do more to be fresh and new while still being the Maiden that we all love. Up the irons...next time around.
6305291446|5.0|This movie is an absolute masterpiece. Filled with so many twists and turns. It made me want more! Michael Myers is back and scarier than ever in this slam-dunk, begging for more slasher! Laurie Strode had moved away and changed her name so her brother wouldn't find her, but he's back, and living is no longer an option for the students at a private school in California. Definitely an A+ and I would recommend buying this DVD if you haven't gotten it already!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|All I can say is Wow.  The fact that Maiden can still release an album this good, this far into their career, is not only unprecedented, it's mind-boggling.  I would describe the style kind of as Brave New World style Maiden meets oldschool Maiden, but all with a very fresh approach.  If you are, or have ever been a Maiden fan, my advice is to BUY THIS ALBUM!  In fact, even if you aren't you should buy it.  You won't find musicians this talented, or arrangements this tight, anywhere else in the hard rock/metal world.  Maiden basically told those jackasses in Metallica that they were all a bunch of girls with this album.  Standout tracks include: Dance of Death, Paschendale (both of which rank with the very best of Maiden songs), Rainmaker, and Face in the Sand; although there really isn't one weak track here.  <br />Up the IRONS!!!!
B00004T9UF|5.0|no doubt, 1 of da best rap cds ever. dr.dre's 2001, is also amazing, but this whole cd is great. This is my all time favorite rap album.if u like any of eminem's songs, BUY THIS. i fell in luv wit da song, \\"the real slim shady\\", and i went straight 2 a music shop, and I bought this. i listened 2 da whole record, and it was great. i'm 14, so i grew up wit em, and i hav all of his cds, (and this really rare 1 called \\"physco\\"). But seriously, listen 2 this WHOLE album. This is em's best. He wasn't a lil kid rapper, and he wasn't an old veteran; he was at da peek of his life, and he just totally shocked da world wit this album. Oh yeah, and if you didn't know, this is da biigest \\"rap\\" album ever sold. No other rap cd, has sold 17 miilion, or more. PLZ RATE THIS HELPFUL!!!
B00003CXA4|5.0|The night I watched this movie, I was as tired as I had ever been in my life.  Unfortunately, the movie I was about to watch and not get out of was Gandhi, and it just so happened to be three hours and ten minutes long.  Luckily, that was this movie's only flaw.<br />I recommend this movie to any breathing, living person on this planet.  It may just change how you think.  This movie not only perfectly captured the life of Gandhi, but it also captured the horrors of ethinic conflict and war.  The entire time I was thinking about how disgusting the way white people treated &quot;colored&quot; people in those days was.  Any movie that jolts me with this much emotion I will love.  I believe that is what makes a great movie.  It really captures you as if you are a fish, but you do not die and become dinner.  You are thrown back after feeling the harshness of the outside world.  That is exactly how I felt.  And because of that, I would really consider this one of the best movies ever made.<br />The acting was not alone as one of the best things about this movie.  Two words: Ben Kingsley.  He was exactly what the movie needed.  His transition from an unknown individual to a strong-willed, life-changing man is so crystal-clearly acted that you are left with amazement.  Wow!  That is all I have to say.<br />Once again, I must state my disclaimer: THREE HOURS AND TEN MINUTES LONG!  Please, please don't watch this movie at night or when you're tired.  And if you have to, make some coffee.  You really need to keep your eyes and your hearts open.<br />Bottom Line: By far one of the greatest movies ever made...period! (I give it an A+)
B0000024JA|5.0|Tical is Meth's first and best album. He comes dark ... on this album. Tical the song is a nice song to start off a nice album. Then he hits it hard with Bring tha Pain. Arguably his best song. Then he mic battles Raekwon the chef a fellow wu mate in Meth vs. Chef. Then RZA takes samples from I will survive and puts on Release Yo Delf. Thens he caps off the album with the straight Method Man remix. The orignal was better. But, all around Tical is classic and i never regret buying it.
0767817478|4.0|I see this movie is not a favorite to others but it is a favorite with me. They did not show Godzilla too early into the movie because they were building up the suspense, instead showing hints of his size and the damage he could inflict (The first boat attack, claw marks, foot prints, the 3 tug boats, big waves, loud groans). <br />They showed how he became Godzilla, great characters, action, the humor was a little dry, nice ending hinting to a sequel that probably never will be (with these producers anyway). Overall I really liked it, I thought it flowed well and it kept my attention. I think everyone was expecting something more, bigger or maybe more violence - who knows, but if you want more, I suggest renting the older more boring Godzilla movies.
B000002MUQ|3.0|While it contains its fair share of great songs in the Van Halen vein, the last album featuring Sammy Hagar isn't a classic affair. &quot;Can't Stop Lovin' You&quot; and &quot;Not Enough&quot; are all huge power ballads, classic type songs, and &quot;Feelin'&quot; is a tremendous song, at least a great way to end Sammy's end in the band. In the end though, not a lot of these songs are memorable. &quot;Amsterdam&quot; is a little hard to believe, Sammy singing about smoking weed (although he IS Sammy...), and &quot;Big Fat Money&quot; has fitting lyrics, but is ultimately not too great. I have a soft spot for &quot;Take Me Back (Deja Vu)&quot; however, an awesome song that would have been a big hit. Not their best, but a pretty solid album nonetheless.

The first song I listened to was (Ameno), which made me hurry to order the album, but I discovered that I was not the only one who did that, so I had to wait to get my copy !<br />This New Age music combines Gregorian chants with the modern musical electronic instruments, in a new attractive fashion! Some of the songs have a male or female vocal singer, which gives a different nice flavor to the songs.<br />Good songs include:<BR>- Ameno (Remix) is touching, and makes you interact with it. Same applies to the original Ameno. This song became very famous and it's shown in our TV channels in the Sport Channel.<BR>- Era, Cathar rhythm, Mother (remix), Avemano, Enae Volare mezzo, Impera (very sad music).<BR> <BR>There are few songs which are not as good as the others. For example, Mirror, Sempire d'Amor, and After time.<br />Another thing, there is no lyrics coming with the CD or the tape. I wish there'll be in the future. I had to search in the internet about the lyrics, and luckily I found a big fan of Era who managed to gather all the lyrics of Era 1 &amp; 2 songs.<br />Great job Mr. Eric Levi. Keep up the good work.<br />Enjoy listening &amp; don't forget to buy Era 2 &amp; Era The Mass.
0385720920|5.0|Ok, this book is better than \\"Fight Club,\\" and awfully hard to compare to \\"Survivor.\\"  This one's main character is a doozy.  His name is Victor Mancini, and due to how much money he needs to help support his extremely ill mother, Victor pretends to choke on food at restauraunts, and the people who \\"save his life\\" send him money.  If that's not enough, Victor is also a sex addict, who frequents sex addiction support group meetings to have sex with the women there.  Wow.  However, there's a lot more to him than meets the eye, and I think he is Palahniuk's best character yet.  Like all of the author's books, the story is a very dark fable for our rather dark times, and it has a very good theme.  The character's narration is great, sometimes funny, sometimes shocking, but always intriguing and leaving the reader anxious for what happens next.  Like all of Chuck Palahniuk's books, it's a very well-written story that can't be missed.
630469797X|1.0|I rented the director's cut VHS because I heard they are coming out with a remake in 2004. I never saw the Dawn of the Dead until a few days ago, so I felt I had to see the original before I saw the remake. Many fans of this movie were complaining because they don't want to see a remake, but I say bring it on because you can't go anywhere but UP with a remake for this movie. The dialog was as awful as the characters. The movie started off slow, bad make-up job on the zombies, typical falling on the ground and making bad decisions that make you want to groan and shake your head. I realize this is an old movie and that is why I said bring on the remake and put some of these Creative minds, great make-up artists and technology (special effects) to work. I looove horror movies and this movie wasn't scary AT ALL. Highly laughable, very slow, but not scary. For anyone who hasn't already seen this movie wait for the remake because you aren't missing much.
B000002MIB|3.0|The mixing is terrible (the cymbals are way too high, and the only time Eddie's guitar is clear is &quot;316&quot;), the tracklist is so biased it's not even funny (these guys had a singer called David Lee Roth??), but at least the performances are tight, if unremarkable. The guitar solos are really fleshed out and fired up by Eddie, but once again, the mixing renders them too quiet. The bass and drum solos are masturbatory and unnecessary, and the 10 out of 11 songs from &quot;For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge&quot; would have been better served to showcase some classics from the DLR era. A quaint reminder of Van Halen's live skills, but how about some more DLR songs? Or better yet, a classic live album from that era?

B0000BYM3K|5.0|From &quot;Brave New World&quot; to the new &quot;Dance of Death&quot;, my three years three months waiting is paid off.  As a fan for 21 years, the &quot;Dance of Death&quot; is as strong as any Iron Maiden's album.   I heard the song &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot; at their concert in Mountain View on August 28, 2003.  Their show was excellent. I could feel those six guys still have the strong drive and enthusiasm to the music they love after all these years.  &quot;Dance of Death&quot; is a must buy for the Iron Maiden fan and a must have for the collectors.
B000002AGM|5.0|WONDERFUL!! There can't be many other words to describe this gem, a sublime, wonderful collaboration between Miles Davis and Gil Evans. Evans' orchestral arrangements are so perfectly complemented by Miles' aching, tender flugelhorn; it's almost too good to be true. Listening to this album is something akin to being in heaven: if there's any album in Miles' body of work that can compete with &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;, this one is it. If you haven't heard it, you haven't lived.

0385512104|4.0|From the first moment I heard the premise of this book I was intrigued. The effects of living with autism remain clouded in mystery and are often misunderstood. A CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHTTIME provides the reader a rare glimpse into the world of autism. After Christopher, a 15-year-old autistic boy, discovers the murder of a neighbor's dog he decides to solve the mystery in the fashion of Sherlock Holmes. With the guidance of a schoolteacher Christopher documents his clues and suspicions in a book. He relies heavily on logical and mathematical explanations of the events occurring around him. Although his investigation begins with the dog's death, his focus quickly widens to the mysteries involved in his own family. <br />During his investigation Christopher highlights the numerous obstacles he faces as a result of his condition. He is extremely perceptive and sensitive of the details of objects around him. If he is unfamiliar with his surroundings he often suffers from a type of sensory overload since he is unable to filter out images, smells, and sound. Most importantly, Christopher is extremely sensitive to touch. One of the most touching aspects of this book was the manner of how others would hug him. <br />Mark Haddon succeeds in highlighting the obscurity of autism and simultaneously providing an entertaining story of the mysterious murder of a neighbor's dog. I don't hesitate to recommend this book to others.
0333710932|5.0|This is such a great book, with excellent rhymes and rhythm to the text.  It is an absolute favorite of both my husband and me to read to our 9-month-old, and we expect to be reading it with him for many, many years. (It's probably too advanced for him, but the bright, colorful pictures and the rhythm of the text keep him interested.) I'm so disappointed that it's become special order only - we wanted to get it as a gift for several nieces - it is really a great book and so much better than what you can find at a typical bookstore.  (It might still be available from Amazon.co.uk if you can't get it here.)
B000002ADT|5.0|I've never reviewed a jazz album, and I don't pretend to be an expert on them, so here goes. I love this album simply because it's like an old shoe. I haven't had it for ages, I'm probably not mature - and definitely not musical - enough to dissect it on a musical level, but everytime I listen to it, I'm swept away by its warmth and beauty. It's obvious that Miles, Coltrane, Cannonball and all the musicians are on top of their game during these sessions and they made an album that sounds as wonderful today as it must have in 1959. Whether it's myxolydian scales they're playing, or in a B-flat key, I can't tell. I just love to listen to it and relax.
B000007638|5.0|This is easily the BEST Paul M &amp; Wings album,<BR>one of the best LIVE album ever!!<BR>It has a LOT of energy; just like the F. Comes Alive album.
B0000399WI|5.0|I can say this much it is an extremely good movie and an even better storyline with great acting from Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, truely outstanding.
B0000AM6LY|5.0|I must say, I cannot quit playing this great cd! The year 2003 has had a few nice cds, but until I played this one, I hadn't found my FAVORITE of the year, but now I have a winner!<br />Like other reviews have stated, the first 4 tracks are the best.  The single &quot;SUNRISE&quot; samples Hall &amp; Oates' &quot;I Can't Go For That(No Can Do)&quot; and although I HATE sampling, it works here......and his cover of &quot;You Make Me Feel Brand New&quot; is simply wonderful.<br />Mick Hucknall has put out the best soul album this year, he could show these kids a thing or two about how to do it and do it right.......<br />I have been waiting for this cd all year and didn't even know it.
B000002LPD|5.0|The third album for Sammy Hagar with Van Halen was probably their best: after the aged electronic drums of the last two albums, and the huge power ballads, Eddie, Sammy, Mike and Alex bring the heat with tight rock songs and wild lyrics. There's no love here, only sex and phone sex lines. The only respite comes into the form of \\"316\\", a gentle acoustic guitar melody played for Eddie's newborn son Wolfgang. These songs all smoke with Eddie's guitar pyrotechnics: crunchy riffs and soaring guitar solos. The band also crafts a huge anthem with \\"Right Now\\", featuring an instantly recognizable piano riff...If you like raw rock with amazing guitar work, get this album today!
B0000AI44Q|3.0|This album had potential to be GREAT if Young turned up the Amp to rock. <br />After many plays, I start to like it more. I'll rate this the BEST after the Glory album.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|Nothing like the predecessor . . . BNW was a surprise--upbeat, fast, great songs, and in-your-face.  This album is slower, rather depressing upon first listen, and a bit hard to swallow.  When compared to other albums, it reminds me much of the X factor.  Some of the songs take a minute or two before they really &quot;start&quot;.  Overall, it is disappointing.  It seems as if Maiden have stopped trying.  I have been a diehard Maiden fan for years and it looks like BNW was a mistake.  How you can get the likes of Dickinson, Smith &amp; Harris and get mediocre songs is beyond me.  No doubt, there are a few decent tracks here but nothing to rave about.  In particular, the title track is a terrible song!  I believe this album will get mixed reviews across the board--some will like it, others will not.
B000002L99|4.0|Although not as much a classic as &quot;1984&quot; or &quot;Van Halen&quot;, this is nonetheless a fitting album introducing screecher Sammy Hagar into one of rock's biggest bands ever. My one complaint with this album is the drums: I hate the electronic sound, it doesn't fit with VH's sound. Case in point: their 1978 debut sounds more &quot;modern&quot; than 1986's &quot;5150&quot;. The drum sound has aged horribly, and too sharply ties these otherwise fine songs to the era.<BR>That being said, there are songs here which rank as some of Van Halen's best. &quot;Why Can't This Be Love&quot; and &quot;Dreams&quot; are the first two of their big power ballad hits (although in my opnion &quot;Love Walks In&quot; dwarfs them both), and &quot;Summer Nights&quot; is simply outstanding, possibly their best Hagar song. A fun album, and the first where Hagar showcased his considerable pipes. Not a classic, but a solid album nonetheless.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|The mature ,road hardened, veterans of metal have raised the bar once again.  It should be nominated and win a Grammy if that means anything anymore.  UP THE IRONS!
B00006690G|4.0|Not as groundshattering as his classic \\"Marshall Mathers LP\\" from the golden Y2K era, but exponentially better: sick, twisted, sad, funny. It plays like a concept album, and it perhaps is: a day in the life of Eminem perhaps? What brings this album down is how his topics stagnate slightly: we know you hate your mother! Try some more of the political stuff you started to touch on. &quot;White America&quot; is one of his deepest lyrics, a lumbering diatribe on his color elevating his sales above his black colleagues. Another problem is the lenght of the album: he definitely needs to edit this down about 4 songs, 3 skits and 25 minutes. While his rhymes are great, we could all do without &quot;Soldier&quot;, &quot;Say Goodbye to Hollywood&quot;, &quot;When the Music Stops&quot;, and the over-the-top &quot;Drips&quot;. Several other songs could use some modification to bring out their full potential. The skits are also pointless: &quot;Steve Berman&quot; fit perfectly on the &quot;Marshall Mathers LP&quot; but is just pointless here. If Eminem's next album is maybe around 50 minutes long, and expands on his political rhymes from this album, it'll really be a force to be reckoned with.
1558908382|5.0|If I'm correct, after this movie came out, all the big Cusack fan sites started. Coincidence? I think no compadre. I know I definatly fell head over heels for John Cusack after this movie, not only because of his performance, but because he also wrote the movie, produced it, and supervised the soundtrack (which also kicks some serious boo-tay, featuring some great 80s hits such as: \\"Blister In the Sun\\"-by The Violent Femmes, and \\"Rudie Can't Fail\\" by The Clash. A little trivia for you...When John Cusack and his buddies at New Crime Productions were writing the script to this movie, they kept The Clash in mind throughout and had Joe Strummer write the score for the movie.)<br /> I was a little dispointed in the DVD version of this movie because of the lack of extras. I was hoping for some commentary or deleted scenes, but alas, all you are left with is the trailer and some \\"suggested titles,\\" which bore everyone to death. Still, it is wide-screen and the movie is amazing by itself so the rating will not be lowered.<br /> I'm sure everyone viewing this review has seen the movie, but I'll outline the plot for the unblessed among you.<br />Plot: Martin Q. Blank doesn't know what to do with his life. He has the money, car, but his life feels empty. His therapist reminds him that the angst over killing a lot of people might have something to do with this (He's a lonegunman, professional killer, hitman, however you'd like to describe that profession.) He and his assistant (a brilliant Joan Cusack...what great genes that family has) tell Martin to go back to his high school reunion on the way to do a hit to reunite with his old girlfriend...the one he ditched on prom night and has not stopped dreaming about since. Chaos insues when after not joining a hitman's union fronted by Grocer (a phycotic hitman with frayed nerves), plans to kill Martin by siccing Feds on him after he performs his hit. In the process of reuniting with Debbi, (Minnie Driver, love that woman, she is funny and great in this movie) he realizes that there is so much more to life that he overlooked. It so cute when he holds that baby at the reunion...he realizes the value of human life when he looks into the baby's eyes...a very touching moment.<br />Does Martin deserve a second shot? (Bad pun, I know) Will he redeem himself? What will Debbi do when she finds out what he really does for a living? Will Martin ever live down his shame at being know as \\"poodle puncher?\\" Watch the movie one time to find out, and twenty more times for fun and the joy of seeing John kick some butt (he does all his own kick-boxing stunts that he learned in Say Anything...his kick-boxing instructor also plays the \\"thug\\" that is trying to kill him) and wear all black suits. Great plot, witty dialogue, wonderful cast, plus John's friend George Piven's in it. Amazing John movie, definatly in my top five list.unny and great in this movie) he realizes that there is so much more to life that he overlooked.

B000002LEM|4.0|Once again, the electronic drums mar some of Van Halen's most loose, fun songs. However, I can't let this minor criticism get in the way of the songs themselves. This album contained another huge power ballad, \\"When It's Love\\", and the bluesy romper \\"Finish What Ya Started\\", along with the vaguely spiritual lyrics of the opener \\"Mine All Mine\\" and the raunchy 7-minute rocker \\"Cabo Wabo\\". A particular favorite of mine is the [physical]-fueled \\"Black and Blue\\": love that riff! Although over-looked these days in favor of other Van Halen album, this is a must-have for all Van Halen and especially Sammy Hagar-era fans.
B00007LTIA|2.0|As a longtime and diehard Yes fan, I can safely say that this album is a serious clunker. Another reviewer said this is a love or hate album. I would agree. I wouldn't say I hate it, but I definitely dislike most of it. The Ritual is pretty good, but the rest is just boring and directionless. I love long epic prog songs, but these songs just sound like they were made long just for the sake of being long. They just kind of meander along with no purpose or direction at all. It is a shame because the albums before and after it are all great. The Yes Album, Fragile and Close To The Edge are 3 of the greatest prog albums of all time and Relayer is pretty darn good too, but Tales From Topographic Oceans just falls way short of the mark.
B00005B58Y|5.0|This is one of my favorite Miles CDs, a high-tempo ... with barnburning blues and fast jazz. I love their take of the traditional \\"Billy Boy\\" and Thelonious Monk's \\"Straight No Chaser\\" is given a supreme interpretation here. Miles' modal-anticipating \\"Milestones\\" is a classic and still remains a big favorite of mine. So few people have reviewed this album...it's time more of you start listening to \\"Milestones\\"!!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|My god, this band is out of control.  I saw Iron Maiden this summer and Bruce Dickenson said, \\"we don't put out (junk).\\" <BR>He wasn't kidding, this album is phenomenal.  Catchy songs, Dickenson's voice is flawless, the triple guitar attack is wicked, strong guitar riffs, twisted bass lines, and brutal drum work.  Point blank, this album destroys any album released this year.  Maiden said they would put out a great album, and they delivered.
B000002TYX|2.0|Being pretty much forced to surrender my gift certificate to this rather than &quot;Mellon Collie&quot;, I was almost put off the Beatles right off the bat. I didn't like this CD. Aside from &quot;Free as a Bird&quot; and some of the later tracks nearing their creative golden age, I just didn't like the songs. Maybe I'm picking bones, but at the time I wasn't a hardcore-enough fan to go ga-ga over 15 second snippets of interviews with John Lennon and some bad-sounding demos. Historic significance didn't really mean much to me back then, and it still doesn't today. Perhaps one day I will give this album a thorough listen to see if I like it, but the last time I listened to it, it still didn't click with me. Stick with the next two Anthologies, especially number 2: two discs of embryonic genius.
B000084T18|1.0|I like Christian music.  None of that pozer Christian music like POD.  I like the soft and soothing kind.  Such as Mighty Lord, Shine Jesus Shine, and my favorite group is Sonic Flood.  What is 50 Cent does someone have bad grammer because I sure could use 50 cents to give to my loving and sharing church.  I would accept donations.  Any good sugestions about good soft Christian music? Email if you do.<BR>             God Bless You All
B00006LSM3|5.0|The Quiet Beatle's passing last year was expected, but still terribly sad. Hearing about a new album coming out, I was afraid it might be a plundering of songs in progress, perhaps released in raw form, perhaps butchered together. I was very glad to hear that the producer and George's son Dhani were among those who completed this album. One would expect these songs (written and recorded when George knew his time was short) to be sombre and depressing. Instead we get songs recorded by a dying man who wants to express his wonder in living one more time, with wonderfully written songs and arrangements. A truly wonderful album, especially in light of its creator's sad end. Rest in peace, George. Thank you for the music.

B000002AH7|5.0|I'm not a seasoned jazz, or Spanish music, veteran, but even I can appreciate the subtle Spanish mood Miles puts together with Gil Evans on this album. Miles' solos on the flugelhorn are fiery and precise, and the arrangements are simply wonderful. There's not much I can say about this album that wouldn't give me away as incompetent in the field of jazz, but &quot;Sketches of Spain&quot; is another album I love to relax to. Very intriguing stuff.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Just picked up DoD two days ago and have listened to it about 5 times now.  All I can say is that the more I listen to it, the better it gets.  Maiden has done it again, it is just wonderful to hear them back in top form after it had seemed like all hope was lost when Virtual XI came out.   Up the Irons!
B00005JM02|4.0|I took my three year old to see this movie and he just loved it. He has a problem sitting through movies but when this one came on he was very interested in it. Bruce the Shark, was the only thing that he talked about. After we came home, where ever we went in the car he always told me that Bruce the shark was chasing us. He was really cute about it. Anyway, I thought the movie was very well thought out and wonderful sound. I know that my son and I look forward to when the DVD comes out because this will definitely be one that we add to our collection.

B0000844IT|5.0|Army of Darkness is easily one of my favorite movies. It's one of those rich, cult classics that whenever you meet a fellow fan, you develop an instant kinship. Why? It's the kind of movie that only a specific kind of horror/cult fan enjoys. It's campy. It's silly. And to be quite honest, it's a heck of a lot of fun.<br />In case you live under a rock, Army of Darkness is part 3 of Sam Raimi's zany Evil Dead trilogy. The first film was straight horror. Evil Dead 2 was a kind of horror-comedy. Army is a straight comedy. The transition from the first film to the third is fun ride to behold. If you watch them in a row, you can't help but wonder how such a transformation takes place. Raimi becomes more and more comfortable injecting his special kind of &quot;Three Stooges&quot; humor into each film. It's a treat to watch Raimi's growth from the low-budget independent director of this series to his mainstream success in Spider-Man.<br />Picking up at the end of Evil Dead 2, Ash has been tranported back in time to the Medieval Ages. His only hope for getting home is to find the Book of the Dead, protect the world from the legions of the Deadites, and remember the incantation to keep the book from destroying the world. Knowing Ash, this is easier said than done.<br />You can't take this kind of film seriously, and if you do, you're not going to enjoy it. Don't look for logic, don't look for flaws; just relax, laugh, and enjoy yourself. Allow Raimi's visual talent and humor to work its magic.<br />Sample lines: &quot;You found me beautiful once,&quot; says Ash's possessed girlfriend. Ash replies, &quot;Honey... you got REAL ugly.&quot;<br />Bruce Campbell pulls his tour de force as Ash. Ash has cycled from full-fledged coward to a inspiring hero who dispatches Deadites with a manic glee. Many of his one-liners in this film have become classic and were used in the &quot;Doom&quot; games.<br />The Boomstick Edition includes both the director's cut of the film and the shortertheatrical cut, making this edition the definitive Army of Darkness edition to own. This is one you have been waiting for folks. Then again, who knows what the NEXT edition for Army will have on it. Seems like they put a new one out every 6 months.<br />The DVD extras are plentiful. The Raimi/Campbell commentary is as good as ever. Sound is great; ditto picture. This leaves us with only one question:  &quot;Hey, what's that on your face?&quot;

B000002KET|5.0|Sabbath Bloody Sabbath has been a point of contention for fans of the heavy metal veterans. The production is rich and polished, while the songs are, God forbid, precariously close to commercial. It also ushers in a greater reliance on keyboards and minor notes, the latter often lending a Far East flavor to the material.  Even the cover caused an uproar with critics, who claimed it was an idea taken to excess.  Other than Paranoid, which has found acceptance with those who buy only what they hear on the radio, this is the most palatable CD for the uninitiated.  <br />The song Sabbath Bloody Sabbath opens the disc. Many will wonder what all the fuss is about, for it is loud and nasty.  Osbourne strains on the high notes, while Iommi somehow makes simple, repetitive chord progressions a work of art. The song borrows a bit from King Crimson's 21st Century Schizoid Man for its conclusion.<br />A National Acrobat is lush, dark and most true to the established Sabbath sound. Notice, though, how a seasoned Osbourne will at times break the melody away from the guitar riff rather than shadowing it as he had done on early albums. Iommi has a little fun as he closes the song with a melodic, almost bouncy series of runs.<br />Fluff may have don irreparable damage to the band's reputation.  It is an acoustic piece that could have been penned for a child's music box.  Most listeners seem to miss the sardonic message of the ditty that clearly was poking fun at the band's image and their aged, lost-in-the-sixties, bubble gum-loving critics.  THE SONG IS CALLED FLUFF!  That alone should have given the joke away.  But the harder and faster crowd, who had pigeonholed the band, took it as an insult to their loyalty and saw it as the beginning of the end.<br />Sabbra Cadabra is another departure.  The upbeat roller features tremelo guitar, ala Ritchie Blackmore, and even piano filler.  While structurally the song resembles a Deep Purple composition, it is the sinister quality of Tony'sguitar and distinctive vocals of Ozzy that distinguish the song from comparable pieces.  The final moment of the tune has Ward dropping his sticks on the drums, possibly a comment on the casual attitude they had toward creating the main stream rocker -- as if to say <BR>\\"Do you see how easy this is for us?\\"<br />Killing Yourself To Live, too, leans toward more traditional rock and roll, though Sabbath never did anything that was just rock and roll -- at least not yet.<br />On Who Are You, the guitar is replaced by a synthesizer, one more first for the band.  Though I am often too impatient to sit through the plodding electrical drone, the song has an enigmatic quality that can be hypnotic if in the right mood.  It's a stoner's delight.<br />Looking For Today is a great riff-driven pop tune that had a short stint on FM radio.  This is a lost jewel.  I'd like to grab the collective collar of hard core fans who dismiss it as whimsical and shake some sense into them.  The band seems capable of doing anything at this point, but Sabbath pioneers want more of the same, while the hit parade bunch fear that buying a Sabbath album just might be a sin.<br />Spiral Arhictect is light and more sophisticated than anything Sabbath had done previously -- considered sacrilege by many as orchestral strings are evident.  It has a more complex melody than you will normally hear coming out of a metal band. Iommi and Osbourne prove to be very underrated songwriters. Ward and Butler have risen from a serviceable rhythm section to one of the most interesting and innovative.<br />On to Sabotage, the last of the near-perfect six...<br />The fact that this album has not received mass radio airplay speaks volumes about the sad state of that medium.  One of the most influential and enduring bands in rock and roll is virtually nonexistent in the stale, repetitive environment of classic rock radio.  How 'bout another helping of Baba O'Riley? Yeah, another deep cut!...or is it a lost track?
B00006879E|4.0|Every once in a great while a band comes along that crosses genres smoothly, with a beautiful infectious-like sound. This is one of those bands. I especially like the songs Tangled, The Sun and Must Get Out. Do yourself a favor and go out and pick this CD up and let the fun begin.
B00005LOUQ|5.0|I must have seen this movie a kazillion times now, and I can still find enjoyment in it.  My kids love it and it is the most frequently watched movie in the house.  The Grinch is tame enough for two year-olds, mostly because Jim Carrey creates such a lovably gruff character that it is hard not to be taken in by him.  What I enjoy most is the little Grinch, one of the many liberties Ron Howard took with the classic story and had so much fun in the process.  Why we even find out the Grinch had a love interest!  This is a movie that builds on the original, makes a soft statement on the commercialization of Christmas by making little Cindy Lou into a Whovian version of Virginia.  There is a witty banter and playful allusions such as the dropping of car keys into a fish bowl at a Christmas party, where we are first introduced to baby Grinch as his parachuting basket gets caught up in trees and he looks in on his future household. But, Howard never loses sight of the story, retaining its rich Christmas character, and providing more depth to the Grinch. The DVD has many extra features to round out the film.  Too bad it doesn't have a copy of the orginal to go with it.  A real family treat!
0156027321|4.0|I enjoyed &quot;Life of Pi&quot; by Yann Martel, however it was a challenging read.  When I first read the book, I found it rather disturbing, and disliked it.  It took me a while to fully comprehend and appreciate metaphoric aspects of the book.  This book would be fun to read with a Lit class or a reading group.
B000063CPL|5.0|I am very proud to write this review,as maybe Im the only one here to be there by  the time it was being recorded.Im a Maiden fan since 1980,when I bought their album.But in the 90s things just didnt work for the band,and not so good albums were released.Brave New World was a beautiful return,and a lot should be expected from the concert in Rio.<BR>They didnt disappoint us,and the performance was just perfect.Everything was like old Maiden,there they were again,the Beast was back!!<BR>I just cant describe what it was to be there watching them as I did in 1985,in Rock in Rio I(I was there,too).So,as it is impossible to say it in words,buy this album and feel how it could have been.A perfect performance for the perfect audience.<BR>It was just impossible not to cry when more than 100.000 people joined the eternal intro to &quot;Number of the Beast&quot;.<BR>Technically,this is also a perfect live album.Good quality recording,everything is clear and ,god,how they can play.<BR>Buy this.Then come to Rio.
0316548189|5.0|One can find the basic history of Apartheid and white rule in South Africa from any number of easy-to-handle sources.  This source gives what none others can: the full background of arguably THE most important man in the liberation of South Africa.  Not only do we get a glimpse at his political life, but a  full inspection of the character details and personality development that pushed him throughout his work.  The piece, though long, is very readable and provokes far more thought and interest than any brief or fact sheet or article I've ever read on the subject.  I recommend it to anyone, including myself, as I look forward to a closer reading.
B00004YYDI|5.0|This is the international version of the film as originally released.  Included are 24 minutes of the movie that the US studio decided to cut out.

The audio is presented in a nice 5.1 surround mix.<br />In terms of extras the disc provides an isolated music track, poster art from around the world, and trailers for director Luc Besson's other films.<br />The main reason to pickk up this disc is for the expanded version of this excellent movie.<br />BUY IT NOW!!!

Maybe I was spoiled to hear The White Label remix of &quot;It began in Afrika&quot; before the album, because the album version is a disappointment comparitively.  &quot;Galaxy Bounce&quot; and &quot;The Test&quot; bring the album to a level that may make it worth the purchase, but I'm not sure $14 is worth it.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|The first of the Evil Dead Trilogy this cult horror classic is the most fun you'll have watching a horror movie.  This Special Edition DVD from Elite is top-notch.

B000069HK2|5.0|Many of hot young trendy Americans have heard of the used either by watching &quot;The Osbornes&quot; or by going into Hot Topic. Well, if you choose to try the CD out to see what The Used sounds like, well good thinking. The Used if i may say is one of the best upcomming bands this year. Songs like Greener with the Sceenery, Peices Mended, and Maybe Memories are the best songs ive heard in a while. Not to mention the Box full of sharp objects, with is the best &quot;hardcore&quot; or &quot;screamo&quot; song. I give the Used and the Cd a 10 if i could, and i hope you come out with another cd soon!
0783225849|5.0|An excellent DVD presentation of this classic thriller by the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock.<br />The video is presented in 1.85:1 and although the opening credits show some wear and tear, the rest of the film is in really great shape.  The transfer is surprisingly good with great blacks and shadows throughout.  The audio is 2.0 channel mono and is also in good shape.<br />As if the great presentation of the movie wasn't enough, Universal has included The Making of Psycho.  A 90-minute documentary on the film.  Also included is the shower scene analysis with or without music and the storyboards for the scene.  There's also the Universal International Newsreel &quot;A Visual Pressbook&quot; and the Psycho Archives which feature an extensive gallery of production photos, lobby cards and publicity materials.  Then there's the standard production notes, cast bios and the great Hitchcock tour of the Bates Motel.<br />Can't go wrong with this disc!
B000099T2L|1.0|\\"Crazy In Love\\" was sampled from The Chi Lites \\"Are You My Woman?\\" that came out in 1969. Beyonce is one of the few young artists out there who can actually sing. On this album she definetly reveals that she does not have a style of her own that anyone can mimic.Instead of taking a chance of doing something different, Beyonce just goes with the flow. All of the songs sound like the rest of the [stuff] you hear on the radio: cheesy, [weak], and mass produced.... Beyonce- you can do better than this.
0800141326|2.0|Probably more films have been ripped off for this effort than I have managed to spot, but for the benefit of younger viewers here are those I have noticed --<br />1. King Kong. He was shot down by planes on top of the Empire State building, this new Godzilla is similarly zapped on top of Brooklyn Bridge.<br /><br />2. The Beast from [I forget exactly how many] Thousand Fathoms. This has the rearing-up-out-of-the-East-River motif shamelessly replicated here.<br /><br />3. Greatly-enlarged-atomic-mutations movies. The great ur-movie of the genre was THEM!, about the giant ants. That started in the desert, but They got into the Ballona storm drains in LA, much as this Godzilla gets into the New York subway. THEM! was followed by many derivatives, usually at lower cost e.g. The Deadly Mantis, of which species there was happily only one exemplar. In a film with so many parts for Frenchmen I can only remark 'deja vu' with regard to this much-hacked-at theme.<br /><br />4. Alien and its successors. I could not credit the sheer effrontery of the borrowing of the 'eggs' scene. This particular Godzilla seems to me to resemble the Alien to some extent, but to take the borrowing back 'a generation', so to speak, does anyone besides me think that the Alien in its turn was cribbed from Lewis Carroll's Jabberwock?<br /><br />5. Jurassic Park, as widely noted in other reviews, and I am sure also The Lost World, which I have not myself seen.<br /><br />It nearly makes me weep. For many years I was a closet Godzilla-movies junkie. He was nothing so banal as an atomic mutation but a completely unique creature. He started his career as a baddy, but became a goodie gradually, the transformation being complete by the time of the celebrated Japanese series in which he inhabited an island with a variety of other gargantuan freaks, emerging to save the planet from assorted space-interlopers with much trampling of the industrial infrastructure and much zotting of the intruders with atomic rays emanating from the region of his molars. I couldn't quite tell from this film whether a number of Independence-Day-style fireball effects came from Godzilla or from some other source, and I am assuredly not going to watch it again to check this. To an ageing former Godzilla-devotee this film is a perfect outrage, the crowning atrocity being that this Godzilla is at least hermaphrodite or perhaps even downright female. The ending is exactly what you would expect, leaving the door open for Daughter-of-Godzilla and other similar horrors unthought-of in the golden age of cut-price monster movies in the 50's.<br /><br />A grudging 2 stars because of the cinematic effects and maybe from a touch of auld-lang-syne nostalgia for my own dear Godzilla of old.I couldn't quite tell from this film whether a number of Independence-Day-style fireball effects came from Godzilla or from some other source, and I am assuredly not going to watch it again to check this.

B00005JKZV|5.0|It's been about 23 years since I've read the books.  I do think they were the greatest books I've ever read.  Of course, I don't remember all of the details which is probably why I totally enjoyed this film so much.  I certainly can't fault the \\"Purists\\" for being upset about some of the changes.  The whole \\"Faramir\\" thing is something I vaguely remembered when viewing the film and it did bug me a little.  I know they were going for a darker feal to this film but let heroes be heroes.  That said, I still loved the film as is.  So, it's not sticking to the book.  I'm just glad they (Hollywood)actually made a worthy depiction of the concept in general!  After sitting through the Ralf Bakshi(?) debacle this was an awesome relief.<br /><br />As a film, no matter my fealings about \\"accuracy\\", I just could not give it less than 5 stars.  I love fantasy movies and this series is undeniably the benchmark.  I kind of feal sorry for the \\"purests\\" for their inability to separate this film from the books.  Maybe take a break from the film, clear your mind and view the film later...  as a separate entity.  You can't deny this is a spectacular and well made film.  It's OK to be disapointed about story and character \\"tweaking\\", just don't deny yourself the joy of a film that will get you as close as your ever going to get to seeing The LOTR trilogy with your own 2 eyes.  Some disappointment?  Of course!  However, you'll be doing yourself a favor if you can get over it and get into this story.  Then you can have a favorite book trilogy AND a favorite film trilogy.  I will bet anything that this will not be re-made ever again. This is it....  ... or you could act it out in your mom's basement!!!<br /><br />Oh yea, the DVD is great yadda yadda..
6300268470|5.0|This is just a good movie all around! One of my favs. Anyways its about Chance (John Wayne) and he is the sheriff and Dean Marten is his drunk duputy. Walter Brennan is an old coot the is cripple but plays the best part. They are out to save the town and keep the bad guys away. I wish I could give it more then 5 stars, it deserves more. You should ALL see this old time western!=)
B0000AXE8I|5.0|If you had trouble understanding the first matrix movie and still dont understand it, don't see this movie.  However, if you are among the elite who knows whats going on, this is a must have.  Granted the Wachowski's went a little bit heavy on the german philosophy, however, the movie had a mind blowing last 1/3 of the film.  The fight scenes were incredibly tight, even with some of the noticable cgi charachters that appear from time to time (especially when neo fights the 100+ agent smiths.) It also has a cliff hanger ending that rivals that of The Empire Strikes Back, or any episode of 24 if thats your cup of tea.  I can't wait until this is released so I can watch it over and over again.

B0000AMRJC|5.0|I agree with every other reviewer about the sequence of the incidents, the names of the actors, the resume of the plot, which are all written in most of the reviews, and, thus, do not find it necessary to repeat any. Alternatively, I would list few hints that I deem necessary -after watching- to re-consider what you have seen in the light of it.<br />Since I saw the movie for the 1st time, I class it as reference for action movies, and was always looking for what other directors and actors borrowed from in every action film made after it.<br />The plot is very well woven, fast developing and amazingly presented with its rich dialogue and plenty ideas in a pure non-stop action movie: rarely all these are contained in one movie.<br />A difficult task has been well handled is the feeding of too much violence and action in the movie, without alienating the sequence of incidents from the main stream (unfortunately, some reviewer complained the too much violence and \\"F\\" word in an action movie!) Definitely it is easy to fill 180 minutes with lot of violence; yet, definitely is abstainer to keep the strokes related to one course.<br />Furthermore, the characters are at their best: the gangster, the spoon fed beauty, the pixy good friend, the bodyguards, the conservative old boss, and the corrupted policeman all are very well structured personalities and all have real and vital roles.<br />We may later amazingly admire Brian De Palma for his fine work, how is really astonishing with the planting of the mixture of beautiful ideas and great shots in one final overall view at the end of every scene (the speech in the restaurant and the self-conversation in the bathroom for example).<br />You should look to this movie like a jewel: You can not criticize a jewel but you can dislike it. However, the jewel doesn't really care.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|In an era where every band is trying to experiment and alter their sound, it's truly refreshing for a long-established band like Iron Maiden to not only scoff at this practice, but produce a classic-sounding album for modern sensibilities. All 11 tracks on this record are self-contained stories, that take no more or less time to tell than they need - from the quick-moving &quot;Rainmaker&quot; to the the mini-epic of the title track, clocking in at just under nine minutes. The overall sound of the album in a step away from their previous release (Brave New World), in that it has a less polished feel to it's production; starting with the opening track and first single &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot;, the album occasionally comes across as a jam session. Thus, Dance of Death has the classic sound of The Number of the Beast or Powerslave. Is that a bad thing? Not if you like classic Maiden, and certainly not if you're tired of hearing other established bands like Metallica experiment with their sound and fall flat on their faces in the process. Sometimes you have to take a step back to take a step forward. Up the Irons!

B00003CXXS|3.0|After four years, another JURASSIC PARK sequel was in the making.  JURASSIC PARK III returns Sam Neill to the role of Alan Grant, a paleontologist who is tricked into serving as a tour guide above Site B (from THE LOST WORLD) by a husband and wife millionaire team  - only to discover that the &quot;millionares&quot; aren't what they seem, and that the island has some hungry new inhabitants.  While better than THE LOST WORLD, JURASSIC PARK III is still a weak film at best; Neill is good, and Joe Johnston's directing is fine; the new music by Don Davis is fitting, but can't come near John Williams' scores; the highlight of the film, of course, again, is the dinosaurs.  This time around, they're even more real than in JURASSIC PARK or THE LOST WORLD!  In fact, they may even be the most realistic special effects I've ever seen.  Other than that, really all you can expect is bickering/annoying parents William H. Macy and Tea Leoni, and a sequel that will provide you with nothing more than average thrills.
0553208845|1.0|I never would've read this book if I hadn't been assigned it in my 10th grade English class.  And I truly wish I hadn't.  Really, it's quite awful.  For one thing, it is WAY to introspective for me.  Am I the only one who thinks that Siddhartha thinks way too much?  If he just stopped analyzing everything for one second, he'd realize that all is well, you can be happy.  To him the world is a terrible place, until he finally finds peace at age 60.  Gee, that took a long time!  He was never satisfied and blamed it on the world around him.  Get over it!<br />  In other words, I've had more fun reading the ingredients on food labels.  And they're more interesting too!  But I read it and now its done, thank god.  In conclusion, if you aren't assigned this book for English class, don't read it!
0446310786|5.0|I really liked this book.  It was very well written.  The characters were well done and interesting and there was quite a bit going on in the plot despite the book's short length.<br />I really liked that the story began before the characters got involved in the main plot.  I was able to get a sense of the characters lives before they were changed by the events in the book.  The characters were all very well written, I really felt like I was sharing the experiences with them instead of just being a spectator.  I thought Atticus' character may have been just a bit too perfect, but it didn't bother me that much.<br />I didn't have the really strong feelings about this book that I have seen from others, but I still think it is very good.  And I would recommend it to anyone who wants to read a good, interesting story.

0425129608|4.0|Written in 1941 this is not Agatha Christie's best book, but it is right up there at the top.  I highly recommend this as a book to take on your next beach vacation!  It follows a theme also found in A Caribbean Mystery, that you don't really know the people you meet on holiday.  (It really gets you thinking about that couple you had dinner with last night.)  Set on the English coast outside Devon, Evil takes place in an island resort and is filled with such typically British characters you'll find yourself reaching for the suntan lotion and craving tea and cakes as you read it.  Even if you're not on vacation, Evil Under the Sun is a bright spot for any day.
B00008DDSC|4.0|Didn't know what to think of this film when I watched the trailer.  And I REALLY didn't know what to think of it in the beginning, but the performances were so strong and the production values so good that I had to keep watching.  When it was all said and done I loved it.  What makes the movie work (aside from the acting of the two main leads-Spader and Gyllenhaal who are both terrific)is that with all the bad things that are going inside these two people you as the viewer do care about them.  It works as a kind of perverse love story.  This is not for everyone.  Be warned.  If you liked Punch Drunk Love or anything by David Lynch I am sure you will get a kick out of this.  The ending made it for me.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|This is a great CD!! Iron Maiden has always had good songs and even better CD's, but his reallys goes over the top! It starts out strong with the single &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot; and closes well with &quot;Journeyman&quot;. My favorite song on here is &quot;Rainmaker&quot; It Really stands put with its guitar lines and good vocals (as usual) by Bruce. Another, and probably the bast part of this CD is The drumming. Nico Really can drum like a madman. Please do yourself a favor and check this CD out!

B00005ATZT|5.0|There is a kind of magic when a superb cast, a truly gifted director, and a literate script with equal parts 'over-the-top' action, riveting suspense, and rich characterization, come together. The end result attains a luster that only grows through the years, as new audiences, through DVD and VHS, experience the same excitement we felt, viewing it on a theater screen. In the last decade, only a handful of suspense films could be called 'great'...and on top of the list is THE FUGITIVE.<br />Based on the popular David Janssen TV series, the film faithfully follows the same premise; a doctor is convicted of his wife's death, but escapes before his execution, and tracks down the 'one-armed man' responsible for the murder, as a driven law officer attempts to recapture him. Being a big-budget film, however, the scale of everything is expanded...Dr. Richard Kimble is now a brilliant vascular surgeon, at a major Chicago hospital; the handicapped killer is a dirty ex-cop working on orders from crooked board members of a billion-dollar pharmaceutical firm; and the lawman is no longer a solitary police lieutenant, but a deputy United States Marshal, and his team of agents! While some fans of the original series complained that the 'intimacy' the series had was lost, director Andrew Davis only used the 'bigger' aspects as plot elements, placing the focus, wisely, on the dual stories of Kimble's search, and Gerard's pursuit.<br />Despite the esteem the film has achieved over the years, Harrison Ford has gotten a bad rap for his very understated performance as Richard Kimble. While Tommy Lee Jones certainly had a far flashier role (earning him an Oscar as 'Best Supporting Actor'), Ford's intent wasn't to play 'Indiana Jones', but a man whose whole life was dedicated to his career as a surgeon, and his wife (played, in flashbacks, by the lovely Sela Ward). Seeing his wife brutally murdered devastated him (his scene in the police interrogation room, going to pieces, was largely improvised on the set, and displays some of his finest acting). His search for the killer was not the confident quest of an action hero, but based on uncertain, spur-of-the-moment decisions made by a desperate man, whose medical background was his only tool. Fear does not lend itself to flashy theatrics...<br />Jones, as Marshal Sam Gerard, on the other hand, was a seasoned veteran, the best at what he did, and pursuing a fugitive was 'old hat' for him. With a confidence bordering on arrogance, he ordered people about like chess pieces, multi-tasked without breaking a sweat, and still could charm with a wicked smile and sarcastic remark. Of COURSE he wins the audience's heart!<br />Featuring some of the most spectacular action scenes ever recorded on film (the train/bus wreck that frees Kimble, the dive off a dam into the churning maelstrom of the reservoir), as well as two slam-bang fistfights when Kimble finally gets 'justice', THE FUGITIVE still is remembered primarily for the suspenseful Jones/Ford 'cat-and-mouse' chase, cross-country, and the grudging respect that grows between them...which, ultimately, was what the TV series was best remembered for, as well.<br />There is magic, here!rovised on the set, and displays some of his finest acting).

B000001GX8|5.0|Like many newcomers to the Opera genre, after hearing \\"Sull'aria\\" in the film \\"Shawshank Redemption\\", I patiently watched the credits to find the exact origin of that unearthly recording - and found it to be 1968 Bohm's version. Without much hesitation, I bought this set, almost immediately afterwards, and listened to the whole 3 hours of it non-stop for several months. \\"Figaro\\" became, bar none, my ultimate favorite classical composition, all thanks to Bohm.<br />To this day, I find no imperfections whatsoever with the performers or the conducting. It baffles me why anyone would find fault with Mathis' Susanna or Dieskau's Conte - they fit their roles to a tee. And the \\"extra\\" arias in act IV, in my mind are welcome additions, especially that of Marcellina, which is not only exquisitely beautiful, but also a thematic counterpart of Figaro's later diatribe about the opposite sex. Hermann Prey, Gundula Janowitz, and Tatiana Troyanos, are the living embodiments of Figaro, Contessa, and Cherubino. Never has Mozart's accent on the humanity of these characters been better expressed.

David Lynch got himself an Academy Award nomination for Best Director on this one, and was certainly the most deserving of the nominees (I'm still horked about the Academy's complete ignorance of The Others in the same year); Naami Watts and Angelo Badalamenti were nominated for more awards from more different groups than almost anyone else in film that year. Hell, it's even sitting on IMDB's top 250. (Not that the means anything, so is the deeply boring Manhattan. But I digress.)<br />Trying to explain the plot would probably confuse more than enlighten, and since the whole thing is laden with spoilers from the get-go, I'm not going to try. Naomi Watts is calmer, cooler, and more clear-headed than she is in The Ring (and yes, the overacting is exactly what the character calls for). Laura Harring, the only thing that ever made Black Scorpion worth watching, does a fine job at somehow managing to be mysterious while staying unclothed for long stretches. The rest of the cast, including such luminaries as Ann Miller, Robert Forster, Dan Hedaya, Lee Grant, and Billy Ray \\"I can't believe Pax didn't cancel Doc when they saw me in this role!\\" Cyrus, all handle their roles exceptionally well (yes, even Billy Ray).<br />One warning: this movie will make you pay attention. Like Lynch's too-brilliant-for-TV series Twin Peaks, Mulholland Dr. is loaded with symbolism, out-of-nowhere foreshadowing that doesn't make sense for two hours, important characters who only pop up once or twice, red herrings, Lynch's trademark use of chiaroscuro (the best in the business, hands down), and many, many other Lynchisms. Justin Theroux (of I Shot Andy Warhol fame) even makes a passable Kyle McLachlan impersonation now and again. All that's missing is Kimmie Robertson.<br />Fantastic, and well worth seeing again if you didn't get it the first time. ****e. ****
015670160X|5.0|After exploring the literary genius of Virginia Wolff within her book &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot;, I was eager to read other books by her. My brother's name is Orlando. My mother had been reading the book while she was pregnant with him and loved the book so much that she named him after the main character. Of course I had to read it. I have never read anything like Virginia Wolf's books before. Orlando is probably the best book I have ever read. Her style is so creative and enjoyable. This is a fantastic read. The movie is also good.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I bought this CD after hearing just 2 songs from his CD -- &quot;Follow Through&quot; &amp; &quot;Just Friends&quot;.  I am SO glad that I did buy the CD because I found an artist that writes &amp; performs music for all ages.  This CD has an influence (in my opinion) of rock, pop, jazz, and folk.  I found myself comparing him to John Mayer but what John does for the guitar, Gavin does for the piano.  If my gut feeling is right, he will be as big as John which is a good thing since this world needs great singer/songwriters.
B000003TAW|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the best albums ever made.  Not a bad song on this one.  Undone, and Buddy Holly are classics.  I can still remember seeing those videos in 94 for the first time and this being the first album I ever bought and I still listen to it.  Much better than any rock you will hear these days.  The lyrics are genius, the music is genius, The singer (Rivers Cuomo) is a genius.  BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|It's about time, Iron Maiden records their best music since 1988's Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son album. Well I thought the same thing about their last effort, 2000's Brave New World which brought about the reunion with former members singer Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith but this new cd just obliterates the last one. I've worshipped this band since I was 13 years old and walked into a record store and was mesmerized by the artwork of their then new double live set Live After Death...I bought it not knowing anything about nor hearing the band and once I heard the riffage on &quot;Aces High&quot; and Bruce's wailing vocals I was never the same. I bought their older releases (sometimes buying them over &amp; over to upgrade to compact discs and then when they were remastered) and I followed the band for the next 15 years or so. Their albums from their 1980 self titled debut through the previously mentioned Seventh Son cd are mandatory in any serious metalhead's collection, however I lost my faith in the band in the 90s. The last two records Bruce sang on were uninspired mostly, the two with Blaze Bayley though not as horrible as everyone makes them out to be was just not Iron Maiden and Brave New World had some weak moments plus I thought they were carrying dead weight by letting guitarist Janick Gers stick around alongside Smith and Dave Murray who IMO are the best guitar tag-team in the business. It took a while but the band finally got it right and they're taking metal into the 21st century. <br />&quot;Wildest Dreams&quot;-The opening track, usually a strongpoint of an Iron Maiden cd and this is also the band's first single. Kind of in the vein of songs &quot;Holy Smoke&quot; and &quot;From Here To Eternity&quot;, a little weak, a little too happy for an Iron Maiden song but a catchy song...the middle section breathes life into what could of been a total dud. 3.5/5<br />&quot;Rainmaker&quot;-The last of the short, single type songs on this cd with the rest of the tracks being 5-8 minutes. This one sounds like a track from their 1986 Somewhere In Time album had it been recorded in 2003. 5/5<br />&quot;No More Lies&quot;-This is how Brave New World would've sounded had they done it the right way. 5/5<br />&quot;Montsegur&quot;-Epic Maiden at their best, sounds like it should've been on Piece of Mind or Powerslave. 5/5<br />&quot;Dance Of Death&quot;-A beautiful classically influenced epic metal masterpiece. 5/5<br />&quot;Gates Of Tomorrow&quot;-The intro is reminiscent of &quot;From Here To Eternity&quot; and &quot;Lord Of The Flies&quot; and I thought it would be lame but it's actually better than those songs, should've been the cd opener IMO. 5/5<br />&quot;New Frontier&quot;-Probably the catchiest song on the cd, the first song that lists drummer Nicko McBrain in the writing credits, I scream the lyrics and punch the dashboard when I'm blasting this in my car. 5/5<br />&quot;Paschendale&quot;-One word: genius. 5/5<br />&quot;Face In The Sand&quot;-Keeps the flow of the cd. Another Brave New World-ish song but way better than anything on that cd.  5/5<br />&quot;Age Of Innocence&quot;-Catchy as f**k, kind of reminiscent of Bruce Dickinson's Chemical Wedding cd. 5/5<br />&quot;Journeyman&quot;-The first acoustic Iron Maiden song, kind of reminds me of Kansas' &quot;Dust In The Wind&quot; for some reason though I doubt people into that sort of thing would dig this. Weird song but the more I listen to it the more it grows. 4/5<br />The one thing that impressed me most was that now the three guitarist idea works, you can clearly distinguish who's playing what! Bruce sings better than ever and the rhythm section keeps it going. It's great to see Maiden with life back into them. Easily the 2003 metal album of the year! I have no doubt that Dance Of Death stands easily alongside with Killers, The Number of the Beast and Seventh Son as among Iron Maiden's best work.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I've seen this movie 12 times (hopefully 13 by tomorrow=the 11th of September). Yes, I'm obsessed. But hey: I've never seen so many people review and say that they've seen a movie multiple times! <BR>I love the music, and can definitely detect the Hans Zimmer influence. <BR>I am very interested in other music by this composer, and will research his stuff more.<BR>This has the best sounds: it really brings to mind big sword fights, big sails on big ships on big seas, and the best little theme whenever Jack gets a crazy idea!
0767809246|5.0|My cousin and I love the movie &quot;Stand by Me&quot;. Even though this movie is i think 18 years old, it is still so funny. My cousin and I already promised each other that when we have kids that they will have to see this movie. Time will never age this movie. 20 years from now it will still be the best movie ever. This is by far the best movie of all time!
B000068PQ0|5.0|Could listen to the first song over and over...
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Just caught them over the summer - and they, as usual, put on a whale of a show.<br />DoD is a good album.  First listen, I was luke-warm on it.  After a few more, I think it's probably the best thing they've done since Somewhere in Time - it absolutely grows on you.  <br />All the songs are strong - particular faves are Paschendale, Montsegur, Wildest Dreams, Journeyman, and Face in the Sand.<br />Absolutely worth the cost of admission.<br />Only complaint - the disc doesn't 'look' like a Maiden disc.  No Eddie on the actual disc itself.  (Kinda nitpickey, sorry!)
B00005JLXE|2.0|**SPOILERS**<br />I'm getting tired of these superheroes who all fit the same mold: Parent/Legal Guardian gets killed by thugs, so kid trains himself to be a crime fighter, eventually crosses paths with the guy that controlled the parents' killers or did the killing himself, and then.....what. Some get revenge, some like Daredevil wimp out. <BR>From the start of this somewhat dark movie, it appeared that Daredevil was going to be a real bad-a**, and treat these thugs how they should be treated. Unfortunately, he wimps out. <BR>But that's just a personal gripe and isn't part of the real gripe I have with this film: it's just lame. Come on, Daredevil is basically a blind Spider-man with no web and a better job. Ostensibly his only super-abilities are his remaining heightened senses and his \\"radar\\" (spider-sense? almost) which appears to be only triggered by sound, but he is represented in a few scenes as having this unearthly ability to jump incredibly far with the exact same muscles that you and I have. Okay, we'll assume he works out regularly to hone his strength. STILL, even if he had Schwarzenegger muscles he couldn't do some of the stuff he is capable of in this film. <BR>And his radar comes off as very unreliable, working at its best only in the rain. So what good can he really be? If his enemies go into a library he'd be in deep s***. <BR>I pretty much knew how ludicrous this would get early on during the second fight scene with the school bullies when he was young and freshly blind. Watching him pull off some seriously advanced gymnastics by doing that reverse jump-somersault thing.....I really don't think so. But the best acting in the film was done by that kid when he wakes up in the hospital and freaks out from all of the noise. That was painful to watch.<BR>The first fight between DD and Elektra was poorly choreographed, and you could tell they were hooked up to wires due to their almost cautious movements. Did it really look like Ben was going to get hitby the see-saw when she jumped on the other end of it? No! They really didn't appear to be working up a sweat with all of that fake jumping.<BR>But of course, the ending was the worst possible. If someone killed my Dad, I wouldn't wait for the justice system to handle it. What a joke.<BR>This film is pretty much a Spider-man clone (kissing in the rain? COME ON!), and is sadly a revelation for me as a one-time comic book fan: I really see now how similar some of the Marvel characters really are (and DC as well, for that matter). Who I once thought was so great is just a mirror image of another character, but with a different mask on.
B000002UJQ|5.0|From the opening guitar crunch of &quot;Airbag&quot; to the final chime at the end of &quot;The Tourist&quot;, OK Computer plays out like a masterpiece...it's utterly brilliant.  I've heard people often list it as one of the best albums of the 20th century, and I think that's a pretty accurate description.  It's one of the few perfect records that I've heard.  The reviewer who gave this album 1 star must not have ears.
B00006RCPM|1.0|HORRIBLE. UGH. Why would anyone waste money on such a BAD movie??<BR>HORRIBLE.
B000099T2L|2.0|Beyonc has a great voice and a lot of talent, but the tracks of this album are not allowing her to show either of them. And - by the way - track n. 5 sounds way too much like a song from 4 or 5 years ago. Try again, Beyonc (and . btw - less ballads, please).
B00009RDG9|5.0|The film starts off in 1999 with a battle scene in Kosovo.  Benicio Del Toro, in camouflage, is a good guy who risks his life to murder bad guys.  The next scene shifts to the year 2003, in a wooded area in Oregon, where Tommy Lee Jones rescues an animal who has been caught in a trap. He's a retired CIA trainer who lives like a hermit and works occasionally for the police as a tracker in solving crimes.  It seems like several deer hunters have been viciously murdered, and the FBI is stumped.  Film casting being what it is these days, the FBI leader is a woman, Connie Nielson, who is just too good looking for the role.  But hey -- this is Hollywood.<br />As the film moves along, we learn that it's all because of shell shock as well as a high regard for animal life, that has pushed Benicio Del Toro over the edge and makes him the killer. The plot thickens because Tommy Lee Jones is the one who trained him to kill. And so the rest of the film is a cat and mouse game between these two men.<br />The director, William Friedkin, did an excellent job in creating the tension and making the fight scenes seem so real that I could almost feel the blows. He also gave the two main characters complex personalities.  The action was fast and the plot held my interest throughout. And the theme of hunting and savagery towards animals was also explored.  Also, the excellent acting as well as a well crafted screenplay made the film rise above its genre.  Recommended.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Dance of Death is simply the best Iron Maiden album since Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. <br />Excellent song writting (with very few exceptions), unbelievable guitars, Dickinson sings like a maniac and the production is superb. <br />The album is very diverse. It has everything from the very first completely accoustic Maiden song (Journeyman) to the most aggressive one (Montsegur), from the outstanding absolutely magnificent epic (Paschendale) to the pure rocker (Wildest Dreams), from the classic Harris arrangement of No More Lies to the also classic Maiden uptempo songs like RainMaker and New Frontier. <br />Inspired bridges, memorable melodic choruses (Gates of Tomorrow, New Frontier), sensitive dreamstate intros (Age of Innocense) and almost theatrical vocal performances that send chills to the bones (Dance of Death). Let's not forget Adrian Smith's song writting at his very best in Face in the Sand. <br />This album has a lot of guitar! I mean a lot! Harmonies, solos, riffs, it's a triple guitar assault. After Seventh Son, Number of the Beast, Piece of Mind, Powerslave and Somewhere in time, Dance of Death climbed in #6 position of my personal Iron Maiden ranking list. It's a must have. It has a certain quality, this &quot;SOMETHING&quot; that lifts it to another level. It's Metal for the 21st century. Nobody does it better! <br />Up the IRONS!
B00005R2M3|2.0|Normally, this CD would deserve 3 stars, except it is based on Shakira's last Spanish language CD, which is worth 5 stars.  Buy it, &quot;Donde Estan Los Ladrones?&quot;, instead.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|Everytime I listen to this I get more addicted, so maybe next week I'd want to give it 5 stars - but it's not really a SEVENTH SON or POWERSLAVE, (or Blind Guardian's NIGHTFALL ON MIDDLE EARTH for a modern reference).  It is really good - the sound flows a lot more than the past decade or so of albums, which sounded a little &quot;stiff&quot;.  The overall sound is actually a bit muddy - it literally sounds like it was produced in the mid-80's, and doesn't hold up to the modern production of Maiden's current heirs like Iced Earth, so the instruments don't all come through clearly, possibly an effect of the 3-rhythm guitar thing.  And yes, Bruce can't quite sing as well as he used to.  But the songs are great - they're definitely Maiden, but they're not stuck in a rut (the CD ends with a 7-minute acoustic song and there's a number of orchestral backings).  And you can hear a little better use of the 3 guitars than the last album, including more harmony guitars.  There's a lot of energy, great instrumental sections, and the types of lyrics that make Maiden great (you know what I mean - history, war, Steve's nightmares).  If you like Maiden for what they are, you'll love it.  If you like Maiden for nostalgia, nothing they do since you graduated high school will please you.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Darren Hayes and Daniel Jones had gone all out in making this album the best in touching on a wide spectrum of human life and emotions. Not forgetting the breath of fresh air brought by the almost perfect music and rhythm. A simply memorable CD!<br />Trust me, you can really relate yourself to their songs and the heartfelt \\"Crash and Burn\\", \\"Affirmation\\" and \\"Two Beds and a Coffee Machine\\" are my personal favourites. <br />Experience true music with \\"Affirmation\\".
B000007SPT|5.0|If your soul could literally sing, I do believe this is the song you would hear. 'Song to the siren', has got to be one of the most captivating songs ever created.

Linda Perry did a wonderful job.<br />Make Over: Sounds really good, but she says in the CHORUS, \\"bullsh*t\\" alot. BUt its really good.<br />Cruz: My #3 favorite song on the album. It is so good.

B0000AI44Q|3.0|Neil Young has been my favorite musician for as long as I can remember, and I've always been happy to follow his odd experiments - in fact, I love some of them. So I certainly gave this one more than a fair chance.<br />When I first heard it, I thought it was pretty good in some places (particularly toward the end) and so-so in others. Then last night I saw the concert, in which he played the whole album straight through, complete with actors and props and a video screen, and it was one of the best concerts I've ever seen. So I went back to listen to the album to see if it sounded any different as a result, and unfortunately it didn't. Without the visuals, it just doesn't have the same resonance.<br />Fortunately, there is a &quot;movie&quot; of Greendale coming out on DVD this fall, which I imagine will have many of the same visuals as the concert and thereby enhance the music on the album. It will contain a bonus DVD-audio of the album as well, so for those of you with a DVD player, my recommendation is to skip the CD and wait for the DVD. <br />For the record, I agree with a review I read somewhere that said that the concept of  Greendale sounds ridiculous on paper but works out surprisingly well in practice.<br />One final note: I would have given the album 3-and-a-half stars, but this site doesn't allow that. So I docked it half a star for describing one woman as &quot;a ready young filly&quot; and another as &quot;a woman delicious.&quot; Seems that for all Neil's occasional liberal politics, feminism is still foreign territory to him.
B0000028PL|4.0|Stain would be Living Colour's last album before they broke up and then reunited and released Collideoscope 10 years later. On Stain, it appears that the band was listening to some grunge at the time they recorded this as it features much less soloing from Vernon Reid and has a muddier production which hurts the album slightly. Stain features many strong tracks but none on the par of \\"Cult Of Personality\\", \\"Open Letter (To A Landlord}\\", or \\"Elvis Is Dead.\\"<br /><br />That's not to say this is a bad album by any means. The heavier tracks such as \\"Go Away\\", \\"Auslander\\", and \\"Postman\\" are all killer. Doug Wimbish's bass is way up in the mix and his playing is fantastic throughout the album, particularly on the excellent ballad \\"Nothingness.\\" Vernon Reid continues to write some great riffs on strong tracks such as \\"Ignorance Is Bliss\\", \\"Leave It Alone\\", and \\"Never Satisfied.\\" Other good songs include \\"Wall\\", \\"Bi\\", and \\"Mind Your Business.\\" The album tends to lose steam near the end with the techno sounding \\"WTFF\\" and the heavy riffing of \\"This Little Pig.\\" This is a very good album that grows on you with repeated listens. Definitely worth checking out.
B00008J4P5|2.0|they have the same set of songs over and over again, with the possible exception of Seven Nation Army on this album.  If you've heard/purchased White Blood Cells, then you've heard/shouldn't buy this album.  this is my opinion.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Let me tell you, this album rocks like there no <BR>   tomorrow.  Iron maiden haved made a masterpiece...6 stars...<BR>   The band is in top form,if you buy just one cd..this is the <BR>   one because it has all the classic elements of metal. My fav..<BR>   track is Dance of death listen to the lyrics and you will get<BR>   goose bumps......run to your record store and buy it !!!!
B000003S2M|5.0|quite simply some of the most beautiful, transcendentally sparse ambient piano music ever made.  Almost seems like music from another world, or music for what this world could be or could've been.  If you like this, make sure to listen to The Pearl - also by Budd and Eno.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|Not the best album by Iron Maiden but the best album since Powerslave. Great guitar and Bruce is like alwas a great singer,<BR>and Steve Harris is a great songwriter. I think that the songs gonna do wery well alive. I am suprised that Wlidest Dream becom the firsr singel it is not one my favorits on the album.
B0000009RX|5.0|a scathing satire of the ridiculo world of half-baked hippie trippy dreamers.  an album that not only went against the boring and unimaginative \\"establishment\\" but was also against the new quasi-fascist \\"establishment\\" of the hippies themselves.  I.e. the hippies want to control how you are just as much as any other group whose members view themselves as self-appointed social dictators (no pun intended).
B0000BYM3K|5.0|With the release of Brave New World in 2000, Iron Maiden made a return to the sound (and lineup) that their fans know and love.  Now, with Dance of Death, they prove that BNW was not just a last-ditch &quot;reunion&quot; effort.  The band is still going strong, writing amazing music, and not showing any signs of letting up (trust me... I saw them live on the opening night of their &quot;Give Me Ed&quot; tour, and today's younger bands have nothing on these guys in terms of energy and passion).<BR>  One thing (among many) that I love about Maiden is that they are able to grow and mature as songwriters without giving up that special something that defines their sound.  A fan always can recognize the Iron Maiden sound, yet the band haven't fallen into the trap of releasing the same album over and over again.  These last two records have marked a new era for the band in terms of songwriting and style, but it is still recognizably, distinctively Maiden all the way.<BR>  Dance of Death has its share of radio-friendly rockers (Wildest Dreams, Rainmaker) as well as darker, heavier metal (Montsegur), and big, epic songs (Dance of Death, Paschendale, Journeyman).  Clocking in at approximately 68 minutes, it gives you plenty of metal bang for your buck.  There isn't a bad (or even mediocre) song on here, but at this point I think my personal favorite --both musically and lyrically -- is Age of Innocence.<BR>  Bottom line: do yourself a favor and pick this up!
B0000AI44Q|5.0|This is the first Neil Young CD with an &quot;theme&quot; running through every song. Set in the fictitious town of &quot;Greendale&quot;, the songs tell the story of Edith and Earl Green, their daughter Sun, Grandpa, Grandma, and cousin Jed. The package comes with a Bonus DVD that features a live, acoustic version of the songs, with Neil offering narrative in between.<br />What can I say? If you're a diehard Young fan, you will love it. If not, you'll find it uninteresting. Listen especially to &quot;Falling From Above&quot;, &quot;Sun Green&quot;, and &quot;Be the Rain&quot;. They are among the best efforts from Neil in a long, long time.<br />There will also eventually be a &quot;Greendale&quot; movie which looks interesting. Young fans can go to his website and preview certain &quot;chapters&quot; of the movie.<br />Neil, Long May You Run.
B000002OX5|5.0|Although both Who's Next and Quadrophenia were classic albums from a fully matured Who, I tend to prefer Who records that came before Pete Townshend discovered the synthesizer. This is probably the finest record from that era, and it's a concept album to boot--in 1967, no less. Take that, Sgt. Pepper!<br /><br />The album is unique for its clever priate-radio concept, featuring silly and whimsical pseudo-adverts between the songs that make The Who Sell Out a fun listen. I LOVE those adverts for Heinz Baked Beans and Charles Atlas (Entwistle's basso profundo on the latter is a scream). The pretentious rock-opera realms of Tommy were still ahead of the band.<br /><br />The album kicks off with perhaps the most psychedelic Who entry, Armenia City In The Sky, featuring electronically phrased horns and extremely trippy lyrics. Next comes the goofy (...) fantasy Mary Hand With The Shaky Hand, the equally goofy Odorono, and the adolescent tale of Tattoo. Of course, every Who album needs a rocker, and I Can See For Miles ably fills that role. This song was the only Who single to hit #1 in the U.S., and deservedly so. The whole band is amazing here--Townshend's stinging guitar, Daltrey's cocky voice, Entswistle's excellent bass runs, and Moon's thunderous drumming.<br /><br />The later, softer tracks are gorgeous too. Sunrise and Relax are great Townsend pop, while I Can't Reach You is lyrically heartwrenching. The original album ends with the two-part mini opera Rael, which is a clear blueprint for Tommy.<br /><br />The bonus tracks, for the most part, actually enhance the album. More adverts are added, and the important song Jaguar is included. Also there is a hilarious spoof on Hall Of The Mountain King, a great Daltrey song (Early Morning Cold Taxi), and another Tommy rough draft, Glow Girl. Moon even has a song, titled Girl's Eyes (too bad it's pretty dreadful).<br /><br />Overall, this is the early Who album to buy. Not only that, it is a superior psychedelic document to the vastly overrated Sgt. Pepper. Of course, get all the other great Who records as well. Start with Quadrophenia (my favorite Who album) and work your way back.epper. Of course, get all the other great Who records as well.

B00005JMNY|4.0|Aficionados of the immensely popular Home Alone series can easily recall the film's hook, lead Macaulay Culkin, among other notable qualities. People fail to recall just what happened to cinema's Kevin McAllister. As Culkin's portrayal of Kevin earned him a garnished career in Hollywood, that career dwindled when he disappeared from the money, success, fame and glamour so highly espoused by his childishly flamboyant character in Party Monster, a daring, draining, and altogether juvenile account of the true events in James St. James's daring novel Disco Bloodbath. <BR>Directed by lovers Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato, Monster ostentatiously exposes the nightlife of early 1990s New York, with its decadent club scene and depreciating drug network, through the eyes of one of the epoch's most controversial party promoters, Michael Alig (Culkin). Alig, along with his entourage: a drag queen debutante, James St. James (Seth Green), a drugged-out drag singer Christina (Marilyn Manson), a sexually adventurous disc jockey, Keoki (Wilmer Valderrama), and an imprudent club owner (Dylan McDermott) move to take New York City by storm with fetish-oriented soirées and drug-oriented midnight bashes. <BR>As Alig begins to experiment with his newfound popularity, he takes advantage of the substance abuse permeated within the culture, and ultimately aspires to gain a place in society as a famous \\"party kid\\".  But, as one would like to remember, all good things must come to an end. Monster moves from the garishness of a party culture to the depreciated moratorium that becomes Alig's life; drugs have become a common pleasure/goal, his relationships dwindle, and his life finally spins out of control in a climax that is both heartbreaking and disturbing. <BR>Culkin's performance ranks in as a less-than-mediocre rendition of a high school drama club portrayal, but perhaps Bailey and Barbato found purport in using this as a vehicle for delivering the underlying idea of the childish and illusory pleasures in decadence. There is a sense of pleasure in humoring Culkin and his pursuit of his juvenile ways. Seth Green, though utterly ridiculous at some points, adds stability to the obnoxiousness and impulsiveness of Alig's character. Some will appreciate this film as a testament to the artistic and audacious nature of cinema; others will view this as an example when directors allow their instincts to shift into a neo-90's MTV-esque overdrive. <BR>I prefer the former. <br />B+
B00004TH6O|5.0|Although the latest Queens Of The Stone Age release Songs For The Deaf seems to be getting all the press these days, the previous album Rated R, in my opinion, ranks as their best release. And I hold Songs For The Deaf in pretty high regard, so that's saying something.<br />This album is way more experimental than your run-of-the-mill stoner rock. Pianos, horns, and electronic effects are pulled out for effect while Josh Homme digs deep into his bag of guitar riffs and comes up with a memorable, headbangable one for each track. The lyrics are typical QOTSA--ironic, intelligent, funny, and drug-induced. Most of the songs are kept short and to the point, and never lose their punch.<br />And my, what diversity. Loud Olivieri screamers (Tension Head), straightahead yet left-of-center rock (Leg Of Lamb, Autopilot), a floaty little instrumental (Lightning Song), a brilliant number featuring Mark Lanegan on vocals (In The Fade), Sabbath-esque lumbering rock (I Think I Lost My Headache), and just all-out trippiness (Better Living Through Chemistry, Monsters In The Parasol), it's amazing what this band can do with just a 42-minute run time.<br />While there is one weak song (the aptly titled Quick And To The Pointless), it's not enough to keep me from giving Rated R 5 stars. Whether you're a QOTSA fan, a Kyuss fan, or just love alternative or stoner rock, this is one of the best-executed albums I've heard lately. Highly reccommended.

B0000BYM3K|5.0|This is one of Maiden's best releases.  The band are showing they are still up to par, and the songs really drive the album.  Steve Harris has allowed much more input from the entire band, and it has made a positive difference.  I've listened to the band since 1980, and they are stronger than ever.  Wildest Dreams, Rainmaker, and Journeyman, will sound great on the radio. Dance of Death, Paschendale, and No More Lies are true anthems.  There is not one bad or weak song on the disc.  Up the Irons!
6305511055|4.0|Since September 11th two years ago, most of us are probably more willing to believe that there can be evil (albeit unseen) forces active within our society which can suddenly result in death and destruction. What sets this film apart from most others in its genre is the introduction of  a guileless central character (Joe Turner played by Robert Redford) who seems to pose no threat to anyone and yet he becomes involved in a deadly situation which neither he nor we understand. Director Sydney Pollack was perhaps influenced by Alfred Hitchcock who, in so many of his own films, subjects an innocent person to undefined but nonetheless nerve-chilling terror. After obtaining take-out lunches for himself and his associates, Turner returns to their small office in Manhattan and finds all of them dead. What happened? Who did it? Why? The situation is complicated by the fact that he and they are employed by the C.I.A. There is no indication that their research has any special significance. Security precautions for their office seem perfunctory. Turner flees the scene, later meeting with his supervisor Higgins (Cliff Robertson). After someone attempts to kill Turner, he again calls Higgins who urges him to \\"come in.\\" By now, Turner correctly senses that he is in great danger but from whom? Why? What to do? He also realizes that he can no longer trust anyone, including Higgins. Still in flight, he (his code name \\"Condor\\") enlists the reluctant assistance of a stranger named Kathy (Faye Dunaway) who becomes his only ally. Enough about the plot.<br />Based on James Grady's novel Six Days of the Condor, this is one of several films from the 1970s which portray distrust of institutional authority because of various assassinations, the Viet Nam War, and Watergate. However, it is important to keep in mind that Joe Turner is not a major political or religious leader; rather, he is a relatively insignificant research analyst in a relatively insignificant C.I.A. field office. For me, the key point is that literally anyone anywhere can be selected for elimination at any time. Worse yet, we won't know who's involved, much less why. Redford delivers a solid performance as Turner, the focal point throughout the film. As for Dunaway, she does what she can with Kathy, not much of a part. Of special note is the work of Max von Sydow (as Joubert) and John Houseman (as Wabash). Theirs is a cold-blooded professionalism which views people merely as \\"assets\\" to accumulate or liquidate per orders from unidentified authorities. This is not the best of the political thrillers but it does portray some thought-provoking situations which still seem relevant 28 years later.key point is that literally anyone anywhere can be selected for elimination at any time.

B0000AMRJC|5.0|Having seen the previous Scarface (starring Paul Muni) many years ago, I was curious to see what director Brian De Palma would do with what I incorrectly assumed to be essentially similar material. In fact, De Palma co-authored a script (with Oliver Stone) and created a film which shares almost nothing in common with its predecessor. Al Pacino is brilliant as Tony Montana, a vicious and impoverished Cuban immigrant who eventually becomes a wealthy drug lord in Miami. Along the way, he eliminates or alienates family members and friends as well as his underworld enemies. Montana's destiny is perhaps summarized by the ancient aphorism \\"live by the sword....die by the sword.\\" For me, the most memorable scene involves a power saw in the bathroom of an apartment in which a drug deal fails. Others include Tony's sudden acts of violence in response to real or imagined threats to his supremacy (\\"manhood\\") and the final sequence when his heavily-guarded mansion is invaded by assassins as he snorts his way through a mound of cocaine on his desk. Steven Bauer is especially effective as Montana's best friend Manny. Other strong performances are provided by Michelle Pfeiffer (Elvira), Robert Loggia (Frank Lopez), and F. Murray Abraham (Omar). This is among the nastiest and bloodiest of gangster films. There is a rationale for most of the violence in the Godfather films whereas in this Scarface, Montana's behavior seems instinctive and is therefore more upsetting. (The same is true of the characters played by Joe Pesci in Goodfellas and Casino.) In 1932, director Howard Hawks wanted to portray a fictional character (Tony Clamonte) based on Al Capone without in any sense romanticizing the criminality which the real \\"Scarface\\" personified. Decades later, De Palma examines with surgical skill how the American Dream for so many immigrants becomes an American Nightmare for Montana and for almost everyone with whom he is associated.
B00003RQNJ|5.0|Most films lose at least some of their appeal after several viewings; a few hold their own; and fewer yet seem to get better each time they're seen. I assign this film to the middle category. The interaction between Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) and the Sundance Kid (Robert Redford) is as lively and entertaining as ever. Under George Roy Hill's crisp direction, the plot evolves in an appropriately picaresque manner as the two central characters rob, flee, rob again, flee again...etc. At one point, a posse of highly-skilled gun men are hired by E.H. Harriman (owner of the railroad so frequently robbed) and pursue them relentlessly. They decide to seek new adventures in South America. They are joined by Etta Place (Katharine Ross) who has a casual romantic relationship with Sundance while being almost equally fond of Butch. Despite all the humor, this is (for me at least) an essentially sad movie. Until the end, Butch and Sundance are dysfunctional fugitives. For them, their only \\"home\\" is the friendship they share. When Etta realizes that her beloved friends have no future, she returns to the United States rather than witness their inevitable demise.<br />William Goldman received an Academy Award for best original screenplay, based for the most part on historical material about the Hole in the Wall Gang. Nice touch at the beginning: A silent film introduction with daguerreotype tint, followed by one of my favorite scenes in which an unsuspecting young man accuses Sundance of cheating at cards and challenges him. The brief conversation between Butch and Sundance before the young man learns that he has just challenged a renowned gunfighter indicates why Goldman deserved his Oscar. The Academy also selected Burt Bacharach (best score) and Hal David, (\\"Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head\\" for best song) to receive awards. Also noteworthy is Strother Martin's brief but brilliant performance as Percy Garris who briefly employs Butch and Sundance to protect Garris' shipments against bandits. Revealingly, they take their duties quite seriously rather than react as foxes would when entrusted with guarding a hen house.<br />As portrayed in this film, Butch and Sundance are immensely likable. Their bittersweet badinage continues until the very end. Much of the film is charming, some of it poignant, and all of it entertaining. However, having seen it again recently, I was even more aware than before of its darker undercurrents. Like Etta,  I preferred not to see them fulfill their destiny so when she departed, I sighed and stopped watching.<br />In addition to clearer image and sound, this DVD version also offers excellent supplementary features which include a \\"Commentary\\" by director George Roy Hill, Hal David, Robert Crawford and cinematographer Conrad Hall; a \\"Making-Of \\" 45-minute documentary which contains interviews with cast and crew, \\"Behind-the-Scenes\\" footage and film footage; and interviews (in 1994) of Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Katharine Ross, William Goldman and Burt Bacharach as well as a DVD-ROM interactive history of Butch and Sundance.

B00009MEJU|4.0|What if you would manage to reach the far edges of the galaxy, and you would not find a lifeless void, or strange cultures, or the perfect predator, or super fast spaceships with laser-guns and warp-drives, or even amiable life forms ready to nurse you into some higher state of consciousness? What if what you would find is a mirror to yourself: the tangible, incarnated moment of your life that was the most affecting of all? It could be anything from heartbreaking tragedy to regretted harmful intent: from your lost wife, to your son who is alive but out of your reach, to even yourself. What if you wake up and it lies right beside you in your bed, unaware of what it is and how it confronts you? What would you do, and how would you handle the confrontation? That is Solaris.<br />Solaris confronts you with the vanity of supposing you could handle the universe around you, when you cannot handle even yourself. That question is what makes me love this film and the original novel by Stanislaw Lem - though they are not interchangeable.<br />And that is the foremost reason people do not love this film. Steven Soderbergh's movie takes this very philosophical theme and enhances it, while abandoning the scientific. I will give an example. In the novel, the surface of Solaris is covered by a weird, liquid substance, a little like water but it behaves. It acts as if it lives, but its purposes are utterly beyond comprehension, if there is a purpose at all. In the film, Solaris is a luminescent gas giant, and the crew never once settles down to discuss the scientific aspects of it. In the novel, chapters are dedicated to these matters. This is but one adaptation. Inevitably, it scares off the purists; but ask yourself: does an adaptation inevitably make for a bad film?<br />I already said I love this film, but how can I - having cared for the novel as much as I do? Well, I care for the film's visual storytelling for instance, and the \\"Vangelisesque\\" soundtrack, and the sets, and the acting. But when I read the novel, the philosophical theme is above all the most impressive. The screenwriters have taken, added to, and deleted from Lem's original story, but they left this core question intact. Accurately: they have done more than that: they have amplified it. And I feel this question cannot be amplified enough.<br />For these reasons, I give this film four stars.<br />Bram Janssen,<br />The Netherlandsacting.

B0000027G6|3.0|Dances with wolves is a wonderful film, and one of the things that has most impacted viewers - aside from Two Socks' death I like to think - is the film's music.<br />And I agree, the themes give a breathtaking and touching effect to the movie. Moreover, apart from being exceedingly well, there are many of them. Great thematic material like this is doubtlessly the most important factor to a movie, and that's why I believe this soundtrack is not without cause or reason amongst the most popular soundtracks ever. It was certainly one of the first acquisitions to my film music collection (and that of many others I'm sure).<br />Nevertheless, there is something to the album that dissatisfies me. And for once it's not: &quot;where's all the rest of the music from the movie?!&quot; It's rather more like: &quot;where's the depth to the music?&quot;<br />I feel there is much too little instrumental variation to the themes. That is, although the themes are great and manifold, each time one comes by it's played in virtually the same orchestral arrangement. Nine and a half out of ten movies with an epic, dramatic score state themes repeatedly. Right, it is what a theme is for after all.<br />However, it is very important in this case to prevent listeners from getting bored. I think the best film music repeats its themes - each time with small variations in key and instrumental colour. Another technique is evolving themes, so that in the start it's 'embryonic' and then grows into 'maturity'.<br />This is the one main defect to this score: it plays its themes instead of playing with them. Certainly after having heard the album several times, you are prone to end up with either scanning to particular tracks or stop listening halfway through.<br />Nevertheless, it is a good album, with music that brings the movie for which it is written to greater heights. And in the end, that is what film music should do.<br />This one gets three stars - and it would have had one-and-a-half star more, were there only more narrative it.<br />Bram Janssen<br />The Netherlandsr more, were there only more narrative it.<br />Bram Janssen<BR>The Netherlands

0767816641|4.0|Madeline is one of those movies that looks so childish. You don't see many kids today saying, \\"What did you do yesterday?\\" \\"I went to the video store.\\" \\"Oh, really? What'd you get?\\"  <br /> \\"Madeline.\\" But really, it's much more better and cute than it looks! Madeline is a French schoolgirl who lives in a Catholic boarding-school with 11 other girls and their dorm-mother, er., nun, Ms. Chavel. The beginning shows how Madeline has to go through the pain of having her appendix taken out and then, when a new Spanish boy named Pepito comes in to live next door, chaos erupts. Some of the girls like Pepito, but Madeline doesn't, and it doesn't help any when she becomes the brunt of a few of his pranks either.  <br /> Basically, it's war: Pepito vs. everyone else. After awhile, though, Madeline and Pepito figure out that it's much more fun to use the pranks they're been doing to each other on people they both don't like. However, the underlying issue is that Pepito is lonely because his parents never spend much time with him, and even though they hire an apperently \\"fun\\" new tutor, all isn't what it seems. Unknown trouble ensues when Ms. Chavel wants the girls to play with Pepito and his new \\"tutor\\", and keen Madeline begins to get wiff of a fishy plot. Everyone soon forgets about that, however, when Madeline finds a new dog, Genevieve, and Genevieve quickly becomes the whole boarding-school's pet. <br /> A negative blow to this positive surprise unfolds when the dorm's elderly, rich owner discovers the dog and takes her away, also declaring the news that he is planning to sell the school, news that Ms. Chavel has secretly known all along. Shocked but hardly intimidated, Madeline gets on her two feet and decides to save the school, reclaim Genevieve, and help Pepito out with his troubled family life once and for all. The exciting, thrilling ending just states that much clearly that you can never judge a book by it's cover, or in this case, a video by it's box. Funny, cute, and adventurous, Madeline is the perfect treat for a family night in with your little ones or just for some clean, funny entertainment.  <br />

Yann Martel imbues his character with a questioning mind.  For example, why cannot multiple religions be embraced simultaneously without any contradictions?  Contrary to the explicit warnings of his zookeeper father, is animal behaviour cast in stone (like religious beliefs)?<br />Undergirding Pi's fantastic journey is his name Piscene...voluntarily shortened to Pi because his name was constantly being ridiculed.  Pi is a numerical constant...a symbol of the inviolability of the beliefs with which he's being surrounded?<br />His beliefs are put to the proverbial test when his journey to the family's new home in Canada is literally shipwrecked.  Pi is the sole human survivor; however he is further challenged by his shipmates...three animals that accompany him on his physical and spiritual journey. They were on their way to new zoo homes. Pi's companions are an orangutan, a Bengal tiger, a hyena and a zebra.  The Bengal tiger soon devours the other animal life and it's Pi and the tiger against the elements.  Pi rightfully wonders when he'll be next.<br />That's where his ingenuity takes over and the survival of both man and beast becomes equally important to him.  Richard Parker, said tiger, requires constant food and fresh water.  Pi, thanks to Mother nature, provides Richard Parker with a regular diet of fish, turtles and other fruits de mer and utilizes the lifeboat's survival manual and equipment to make fresh water.<br />Pi structures his day in order to survive.  Make water, pray, catch seafood, clean lifeboat while avoiding Richard Parker's pounce.  But Richard doesn't pounce.  So much for pre-determined animal behaviours.  Pi also sees himself within an awesome sphere surrounded by incredible skies and stars at night, a veritable peephole into the universe he muses.<br />Along the way, just when all hope seemsto fade, both Richard and Pi find a strange island.  Hallucination?  Fantasizing?  The island does not fit any known pattern...fits no expectations.  Another challenge to pre-ordained thinking?<br />Ultimately Pi finds land, Mexico, and is rescued.  Richard Parker disappears into the landscape.  Was Pi Richard Parker?  Did any of this really happen?  Pi's tale is certainly debated and found less than credible by the Japanese shipowners' representatives.  They want just the facts.  How did the ship explode?  What noises did the ship make before exploding?  Just the facts!  Pi nonetheless sticks to his story and provides another conundrum to the firm representatives when he invites them to select what they perceive as the truth(s) in two versions of the same story he tells.  One is as he lived it with all its incongruities, the other is as they would have it be.<br />Pi and Richard, and a very clever author, test our imaginations and take us on an interesting physical and spiritual journey.
B00004RF9I|5.0|After almost 30 years, people continue to disagree about Network which received an Academy Award for best film. No one questions the quality of acting. Finch, Dunaway, and Straight received Academy Awards; Holden and Beatty were nominees. Rather, one of the volatile issues concerns Paddy Chayevsky's portrayal of network television in the 1970s. (FYI, Chayevsky received an Academy Award for best original screenplay.) How plausible is it, after forcing a news anchor to retire, to allow him to remain on the air after he promises to commit suicide on camera at the conclusion of his final program? Worse yet, to promote him as \\"The Mad Prophet of the Airwaves\\" to increase viewership and improve ratings? Some people have suggested that the character of Howard Beale (Finch) is based on Dave Garroway, a long-time anchor on NBC?s Today Show. Others are better qualified to comment on that. The fact remains, Beale is obviously upset and becomes progressively moreso, ranting and raving on-air (and off) about the emergence of institutional authority and the decline of individual influence. At one point, he urges his viewers to go to the nearest window, open it, and shout at the top of their lungs \\"I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!\\" Hundreds of thousands immediately do so, including members of the network executives' own families.<br />The United Broadcasting Company (UBS) is hardly unique. Amoral careerists and predatory backstabbers can be found in any organization. However, UBS and other networks are granted licenses to use air time owned by taxpayers. Therefore, in certain respects, they have a fiduciary responsibility to behave as a public trust. However mentally unbalanced Beale may be, his messianic zeal to defend the best interests of his viewers is both sincere and legitimate. Max  Schumacher (Holden) is his closest friend and longtime business associate. As portrayed by Holden, Max is himself a troubled man. He feels obligated to support Beale but fears the end of his own career and the situation is complicated by the fact that his marriage has become stale and he is thus vulnerable to the charms of the ferociously ambitious Diana Christensen (Dunaway) with whom he has an affair.<br />Of course, tension builds as Beale's final program approaches. Will he commit suicide on air? Will his substantially increased popularity force UBS to let him continue to anchor the evening news or remain on-air in some other capacity? Will the Schumachers be reconciled? What impact will the Beale Saga have on others at UBS, notably Diana Christensen, owner Arthur Jensen (Beatty) and CEO Frank Hackett (Duvall)?<br />See the film and find out.rs the end of his own career and the situation is complicated by the fact that his marriage has become stale and he is thus vulnerable to the charms of the ferociously ambitious Diana Christensen (Dunaway) with whom he has an affair. <br />Of course, tension builds as Beale's final program approaches.

The songs he wrote were so beautifully heartbreaking that they leave you on the verge of tears but also with a sense of hope. Coldplay does the exact same thing.

B00003CXA3|5.0|To a significant extent, this film is based on a real-world situation in which hundreds of law enforcement officials worked for many months to locate and eliminate the connection between the source of heroin in France and its underworld contacts in the United States. As examined in Robin Moore's book, 112 pounds of heroin (with a then street value of about $90-million) were scheduled to arrived in the United States. Narcotics detectives Eddie (\\"Popeye\\") Egan and Sonny Grosso completed a lengthy investigation to learn who, when, where, how, etc. In the film, Hackman plays re-named Jimmy (\\"Popeye\\") Doyle and Roy Scheider plays his re-named partner Buddy Russo. (Both Eddie Eagan and Sonny Grosso have small parts in the film.) Other variations from the book are relatively insignificant. The situation remains essentially the same. The film carefully follows the extended and tedious period of surveillance which reveals the NYC source; preparations are then completed in anticipation of the shipment's arrival; finally, the connection is consummated and....<br />Under William Friedkin's brilliant direction (which resulted in an Academy Award for him), this film weaves several separate but related plot threads, both within and beyond the United States, which involve criminal activities in meticulous coordination with efforts by law enforcement officials to respond to them. I was fascinated by the juxtaposition of elegance and luxury in affluent (albeit criminal) society with the squalor and decay of the world within which the heroin will ultimately be distributed. I was also fascinated by the style and temperament of Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey) who supervises the shipment in striking contrast with his principal adversary, Doyle, who resembles an enraged bear wearing ill-fitting hand-me-down men's clothing. (FYI, Hackman received an Academy Award for his performance.) Doyle becomes obsessed with destroying the French connection, no matter what. This is most evident during a car chase through the streets of New York which remains the most harrowing ever included in a film. (Even better than the car chase in Bullitt three years earlier? Yes.) All of the acting is outstanding as are the cinematography and editing. The Academy Award for best film was one of five received and each was well-deserved. It is probably impossible to measure accurately the nature and extent of this film's impact on subsequent films as well as on programs produced for television.

B00003CXB4|3.0|I'm suprised nobody else agrees that this movie was the turning point of Disney's fall of quality....because it is! In alot of ways, this film is Disney's worst 'cause of it's hype and it's lack of anything of real substance and human touch. The characters were increadibly 2 dementional (even more than most animated films). The film started out GREAT and the animation is top notch...but the movie takes a nose dive in anything good after it's opening. Most of the songs were quite bland and simply did nothing for character. The life lessons in this movie are...well simply not there. The jokes are embarrasing to hear. Mustofa's hench men are mind-numbingly dumb to watch (especially the \\"Nazi-march\\" at night). I think this film was done so half way 'cause it was a rip off to begin with (Japan's \\"Kimba\\")...so Disney didn't have to work on story, character, or it what it could offer. I would never ever try to show my child this film (if he/she wants to...that's cool). There are WAY more better animated/Disney films like the real classics (Pinoccio, Bambi, Toy Story, etc.) that contain real life lessons and entertainment. This movie is just plain pathetic.

There are still different theories today, as to what exactly is happening in Donnie Darko.<br />As you watch it over and over you'll become completely engrossed in Donnie's world.  You never see the same movie twice, there's always something new to think about.  Everytime you watch it something new will pop into your head...this is a true cult classic, it will be around for years.<br />As my title says, you never know what exactly happens in Donnie Darko.  It truly is a paradoxial masterpiece.  28:06:42:12!
B00008EY9G|5.0|The most original thriller i've seen in awhile, had me at the edge of my seat the whole way through, and had me guessing and trying to figure things out, and of course i was off, up until everything started to unfold, and it came together nicely. Give it a view you won't be disappointed.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Even before I put this CD into my player, I had to pause and reflect on the unlikely fact that Iron Maiden are still releasing albums in 2003. 'Brave New World' was an accomplished and extremely competent comeback, with only a few minor flaws to drag it down. Could 'Dance Of Death' really perpetuate a run of form and prove beyond doubt Maiden are truly back for good? Despite some wildly varying opinions I've seen in the reviews on this page, I'd firmly assert the answer is a resounding yes.<br />A number of factors contribute to making this Maiden's most complicated, and certainly best produced, album since 88's 'Seventh Son'. The double impact of the album openers,'Wildest Dreams' and 'Rainmaker' does very little to hint at what lies ahead. As two potential singles these songs will carry out their purpose very well: 'Wildest Dreams' is a distilled slice of classic Maiden, with a chorus that, instead of being supremely infectious, slowly begins to take shape with every listen, until it comes into its own. I prefer 'Rainmaker', with its gorgeous guitar melodies and equally catchy chorus and bridge.<br />My major criticism of 'Brave new World' was that some of the epic tracks, while being of the highest quality, were simply dragged out for far too long, almost as If they were merely showing that they could. 'Dance of Death' contains four songs exceeding the seven minute mark, and each packs in a lot of technical skill and reams of fantastic songwriting. 'No More Lies', the only song Steve Harris penned alone for this album, is the first of these, and is of the quality I's expect from a songwriter of his prowess. A twisting Harris riff gives way to a melodic verse, only bulding to a thunderous chorus. It's a perfectly formed and supremely catchy epic, and its position on the CD ensures we are reminded of the formidable talent of each and every musician in the band. The title track took a bit of getting used to on my part. It intially seems repetitive, but repeated listens reveal a moody epic, with classical influences and off kilter melodies contributing to a sprawling centrepiece. 'Paschendale' is my standout track from 'Dance of Death'. Indeed, I'm fast coming to consider it a metal masterpiece. Kind of like a 2003 cousin of 'The Trooper',it deals with war in a surprisingly sensitive manner, urging us to 'tell the tale of paschendale' and evoking images of blood soaked trenches effectively. I love the slow build up being offset by the first of many thunderous riffs, the lurching, up tempo guitar sound before the first solo, the middle eight, and the triumphant, inevitable chorus. I cant think of any prevoius Maiden song to compare it to, as their are none comaparable. I would say that the explosive dynamics, powerful lyrics, supreme musicianship, multi sectioned nature and a restrained vocal preformance from Bruce make it one of the best Iron Maiden songs.<br />Journeyman, the closing number, is a departure for Maiden, with chilly strings and acoustic guitars dominating. I believe it will alienate some fans, but i think it a gorgous, perfect parting shot, rounding up the album by reminding us that Maiden are and always have been so much more than mono brain celled headbangers.<br />Nicko's contribution,'New Frontier' is great, with a killer chrous. With so many talented writers in the band its unlikely he will get beyond one song per album though: how about a solo album Nicko? 'Montsegur' has lyrics that sound like 'Seventh Son' and 'Piece of Mind' esque music, while 'Face in the Sand' and 'Age of Innocence' are up tempo classic Maiden.<br />'Dance of death' certainly requires repeated listens, but it will reveal its secrets and exhibit numerous qualities which make it the bands most consistent and original album in well over a decade. Kevin Shirley's production is superb, ensuring the strings dont drown out the gutitars, and somehow letting three guitarists each have their own place in the mix.<br />Most Maiden fans will havepicked this up already, but if you're on the brink, I higly recommend 'Dance Of Death'. Maiden havent ceased to meke challenging and compelling heavy metal.up already, but if you're on the brink, I higly recommend 'Dance Of Death'.

B00005JKZV|5.0|There isn't very much at all to be said about this film that hasn't already been said ad nausem. It totally manages to outdo the first film in the series in every way possible, especially in entertainment value. The characters are well developed and always interesting, and the massive battle scenes (especially the Battle of Helms Deep) are undoubtedly the best ever filmed for  medeviel epic, and that includes Braveheart. Anyone that even vaguely enjoys any kind of fantasy/action and has two and a half hours to kill should pick this up as soon as possible. An essiential piece to any DVD collection!
B0000BYM3K|3.0|Maiden's last album contained moments of metal brilliance, but was undercut by &quot;smooth jazz&quot; production values: twin guitar attacks/bass/and drums seemed to all blend into one big muddy mess, on both home and car stereos.  Dance of Death, unfortunately, continues this trend of gutless metal mush--where is the more sharply-focused sound of any remastered vintage Maiden disc?  The purpose of any heavy rock album is to evoke at least a partial adrenaline surge during playback, not a damn headache from trying to make sense of sonic sludge.  There are a few worthy additions to the Maiden catalogue on DOD, but many of these tracks sound like remixes or leftovers from Brave New World.  Maybe Maiden should give Mutt Lange(or any other metal producer) a hand at the mixing board--buzz-saw guitars and taut bass and percussion combined with up-front vocals would be nice for a change.  This will definitely be the last Maiden purchase without a prior sound quality check...
B00005JLSE|5.0|I hated Moulin Rouge and wasn't exactly excited to see Chicago. What a great surprise it was that Chicago was not only good, but great! The visuals are stunning and flashy without being tacky and the singing talents of the entire cast is surprisingly top-notch. With a quick pace and a wonderful collection of mostly egocentric characters, Chicago is a can't miss example of what musicals are all about.

Try to use your brain and think hard and eventually, you can figure out how to do it.  I have figured out a way to do it now.  This is a great book to change my point of view of how money should be used.<br />Alex
B0000BYM3K|3.0|1. Wildest Dreams - Why is this song coming from Maiden? It sounds like a classic, and I mean classic Judas Priest song. Intro gets you very excited, then like the rest of the cd, gets boring very quickly. Im on my way to change , Im on my way to change songs again, should have been the lyrics!!<br />2. Rainmaker - Now I like this song, this is the way Maiden should sound. I love the riff changes and the classic twin guitars. Bruce sounds awsome on this song. It is going to a killer live song.<br />3. No More Lies - Intro flashback to 7th Son, Another great song. I just wish Blaze, err Bruce would shut the &quot;No More Lies&quot; part up a little bit. It actually kills the flow of the song to hear him yell the same line 8 times!!!!<br />4. Montsegur - By far the heaviest track on the cd. But the song goes no where, and Bruce seems to sound as if he is fighting a cold. I like the small time changes in the songs. Thats about it though. <br />5. Dance of Death - Now I love this Song. The intro is a slow builder. Thus by far the finest moment in the cd. If they released this song as single, thats all I would have bought. They are so many Iron Maiden elements in this song, that fans of Maiden will rejoice because of the perfection. A chill bumper for sure. This song is the only thing that save the cd for me. <br />6. Gates of Tomorrow - Uh why is this song here. It's a left over from No Prayer For the Dying. At first I thought this song would be great, but it does not carry the energy due to one fact, Bruce seems to mumble in part. Overall this lack luster sounds dated, and could have been better!<br />7. New Frontier - One begins to wonder if they went in the studio with a ton of material left over from the Brave New World Cd. This was a B Side, not an album filler. Again the song shows potential, but seems to drag on.<br />8. Paschendale - Uh, this song was on Chemical Wedding, yeah you know it was. My God you say, this is Iron Maiden, lol. Great song, but nothing newhere. Long song, very entertaing, but you'll eventually fall asleep wondering when the thing ends.<br />9. Face the Sand - UP THE IRONS! This is another flash back of 7th Son, but this time done right. Another classic, tears to my eyes. The 2nd best song, I love this song, Right before The Air aid sings theres this killer keyboard part that sends chills right down your spine. Awsome. I wish every song could have been like this.<br />10. Age Of Innocence - Okay why would you totally kill the flow again. I heard this song to, sounds like a B Side from Fear Of The Dark. How can you have killer riffs then go into the chours and kill the song flat in it's tracks. This song reminds me of a long run, you know when you have to keep running to get home, and your winded! This song is grasping for that same thing, please just let it end!!!<br />11. Journeyman - Uh, is this the Moody Blues. This is the one song that should have been keep in the closet. I know what I want and I'll say what a want, please kill me, this song is a pain. What a moronic song. This is Maiden's new country song. Maiden unplugged. This is by far the biggest joke, return to metal, ha a slap in the face. I thought this might be a revelations, it was, a journey to insanity. I had to check if this was for real. Sadly it was. If Bruce would have not sang it would have been a cool musical number, the lyrics killed this one.<br />All in all this was good cd, but the best Maiden cd, no way. Not even close. Maiden's peak was 7th Son, and a close second was A Brave New World. I really thought that after Brave New World this would have been the best thing ever, but I was somewhat let down. All in all it's your money and your ears.  I It's just that a cd with three great songs, might as well deserve three great stars! I will probally get banned from the Iron Maiden web site for this review, but the truth hurts, it stinks!!!!
0783107986|5.0|i will never forget when pbs aired these segements every sunday night back in the 1960,s and early 1970,s. i would make it a point to be home to catch them. incredible footage and masterly narrated by the great sir laurence olivier it is the definitive documentary on the war in europe. i say europe because it comes up a little short on the war in the far east but im nitpicking here. i dont know how many times now that i have the 9 volume set that i review the episodes. i just picked up richard overys &quot; russias war&quot; and after reading it i looked at the footage of the world at war that pertained to the the war in russia. episodes like &quot; barbarossa&quot; and &quot;red star rising&quot; and the episode on &quot; stalingrad&quot; contain just incredible footage. you just sit there transfixed to the tv screen watching the history unfold. it is an absolute must for any history buff    cojaysea
B00005V3Z4|5.0|If you watch this movie you will either love it or hate it.  If you are a fan of off-beat strange movies like adaption or memento, you will like it. Also if you like dark humor there is quite a bit in her for you too.  All around this movie is awsome with a great, thought provoking ending that will keep you guessing even after you've seen it multiple times.
0316666343|2.0|I picked up this book becuase I had heard phenominal things about Alice Seabold and there seemed to be a lot of anticipation for the release of this book. First and formost, I must tell you its NOT a murder mystery as the synopsis lead me to think. Its not about finding the killer or anything. Its basicly about a family's healing process after a daughter was murdered. I proably would't be so bitter about the book had I known the focus wasn't on the murder, but on the family instead. Other than that, the writing was eloquent but a touch on the flowery side at times. Not a terrible read as long as you understand where its suposed to lead.
B000002MY3|5.0|Alanis Morisette \\"Jagged Little Pill\\"             <br /> Alanis Morisette's cd \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" is one of the few cds that I can listen to over and over without getting sick of it; probably because she has her own style. She's not like all of the boy/girl bands out there. She is unique. She sings about real life situations that girls can relate to. Take her song \\"Mary Jane\\". It is about a girl who doesn't like what she looks like or who she is. \\"You Oughta know\\" is about having problems with a boyfriend. <BR> I was sitting here trying to think who I could compare her to and like I said since she is so unique the only person I could think of is Sheryl Crow. And that's not even a total comparison. Sheryl Crow's music is more upbeat then Alanis's but they both have the same sounding voice in a way. All in all I think everyone at least every girl should have a copy of this cd.
B00004RF9B|5.0|Brilliant, big-studio epic. One of the very best SF films ever made. WATCH THE LETTERBOX VERSION! Original, expansive, truly great stuff. Big-name actors, incredible special effects, great music, an engaging story -- this is a movie that you will watch over and over again, it's strong from start to finish.
B00006CXXW|5.0|Christina Aguilera has broken away from her pop princess image in her latest CD entitled \\"Stripped\\". She can no longer be compared to teen idol Britney Spears, but rather to the divas of our day, such as Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey. She has a rare talent of captivating listeners with her strong and powerful vocals. She lets her voice be the number one seller for her CD. Stripped has a variety of songs that is sure to please everyone. Many of the songs like \\"Dirrty\\" and \\"Fighter\\" have an upbeat rhythm making you want to let loose and dance, while others like \\"Beautiful\\" are more serious and from the heart, sure to calm and soothe the soul. She sings of more mature matters, such as self acceptance and relationships, something everyone can relate with. Christina really connects with, and feels the words of her music and this is definitely heard in her album.<BR> Another bonus to the CD is the featured artists. Christina pairs up with Lil' Kim for the song \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" where they sing of the power of women, an instant mood booster for any woman. She and Redman also join together for the song \\"Dirrty\\", a raunchy but still awesome song to put you in the mood for just about anything.<BR> \\"Stripped\\" is a five star album and every song is a chart topper. \\"Stripped\\" is guaranteed to entertain.
B00004VXF2|3.0|I've listened to parts of this record a number of times and have always felt something different each time. However I believe like most \\"art\\", it was meant to affect different people in different ways. And it might never affect you the same way twice. Think Nine Inch Nails meets John Cage meets MC5 meets LaMont Young. And I don't mean just bits of those artists separately and the influences thereof, but rather all of them playing simultaneously at extreme ear shattering volume. The affect of listening to this on headphones is enough to inflict psychotic reaction. It is NOT music to do housework to. Unless that housework involves demolition.     Having said that, I also believe that MMM was recorded for 1 specific reason. Lou was trying to \\"clear the air\\" of all the quote, unquote \\"sally can't dance, your rock 'n'roll animal\\". Which I think means all the fans of those records and others like them. He was casting those fans aside much the same way that Little Richard threw his jewels in the river or Brian Wilson stopped recording and writing music at the height of his popularity. All probably felt a certain amount of pressure, both from record companies as well as the fans to keep churning out the same product over and over with new and different wrapping.   Many times that gets to be the disillusionment of rock stars. The need to sell \\"product\\" as opposed to creating music that means something and has relevance to themselves and their fans. The rock music world rises, falls and changes much too quickly for most stars to retain their shine and fans become impatient for their favorite star to produce the next music masterpiece that resembles and continues the original greatness that they achieved early in their career.    Most groups or even solo artists don't make it past 2 or 3 records because the fanbase moves on to newer, shinier versions. So what Lou did was to circumvent the eventual fanbase collapse and took an axe to his own career by releasing quite possibly the most unlistenable record ever produced. And just to make sure the destruction was complete he recorded 4 sides of it and put a cover on that made it seem like this might be a live recording to entice those leftover Rock'n'roll Animal fans. Lou knew that the shine on his star was quickly becoming faded and felt he still had much more creativity to sell, so he destroyed himself publicly, and then quickly re-invented himself with a new record label and new, self-controlled image. At the same time he was recording and releasing MMM he was planning a major career move to take control of the production and release of his music, instead of leaving it to the whims of the record company and the producers that were assigned to him, as happened early in his career.  I, for one, preferred Lou Reed music with a capable producer such as Bob Ezrin or David Bowie that knew what Lou Reed music should sound like, better than Lou knew himself. But alas, Lou thought he knew better so we have a dozen or so records of Lou's music post-MMM that sounds and feels like someone that can write great songs but doesn't necessarily comprehend how they should sound.     Be that as it may, I would recommend this record only to those brave souls who enjoy the sound of the death and subsequent re-birth of a rock star. It is most assuredly not a pretty sound, and more than likely harkens to Lou Reed's personal recollections of horrors of eletro-shock thereapy which he, himself endured as a young man at the insistence of his parents, mixed in with drug abuse, alcoholism and all the \\"friends\\" and nightmares he formed throughout his life at that time.     Clearing the air sometimes requires total annihilation and Lou Reed certainly achieved that with this record. You have now been forewarned. Proceed at your own risk, because there's a wasteland here with no happy ending.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|i love this album!!!  every song on it has it's own depth and personality.  my favourites are no more lies and dance of death.  they are all very catchy and impressive.  it's hard to find an album these days without a bunch of filler songs, but this is it.  iron maiden have really given us something here.  i suggest this one to anyone, who like me is really disappointed with the lack of good music this year.  GO GET IT!!!
B000002UB3|2.0|This album is OK, but kind of falls short.  The Beatles proved they could rock both early (Hard Day's Night) and late (Back in the USSR) in their career.  So, I've never really understood this band's attraction to silly, non-rock songs like Maxwell's Silver Hammer or Octopuses' Garden (or Yellow Submarine from Revolver for that matter).  Additionally, this album has a lot of incompleted songs (Mr. Mustard, Polythene Pam, Bathroom Window, The End, Her Majesty) that have nice sounding phrases or hooks, but no verses around them.  Also, what is the deal with I Want You?  It has only one lyric. <br />If you are expecting the dynamic combination of the Lennon/McCartney duo present in the earlier years, it seems to be missing.  There are John's songs like Come Together and Paul's songs, like Oh Darling.<br />Why give it 2 stars?  I'll give you 2 words - George Harrison.  Something and Here Comes the Sun save Abbey Road.
B00000JRTX|5.0|My title says it all.  This film is a classic, especially for people who enjoy ensemble casts.  No one character is stronger than another, even though Hugh Grant is the &quot;big name.&quot;  All the others are equally important to the purpose of this movie.  The cinematography and art direction are beautiful -- it's a visually gorgeous film.  The people are so quirky and wonderful, I found myself wanting to know them and spend time with them. Each time I watch this I'm sorry when it ends.  Chick flick?  Maybe, but I watch it over and over.  A keeper.

B0000BYM3K|5.0|Dance of Death is a great CD.  All the songs are good and a few are great (Rainmaker, Montsegur, New Frontier, The Age of Innocence).  A must get for any Maiden fan.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|You will not find a better movie with the best special effects and greatest plot. This is a very deep movie and for those who have a difficult time understanding the depth of this movie will give it bad reviews- simple. <br />The One, has now harnessed most of his abilities and has become unafraid of many thing except he has one fault- love. If you call that a fault how can The One not have love or compassion for human life. This is the very thing the movie is about.<br />Morpheus, does an excellent job, but his characters takes a backseat allowing the rest to ride the wave. He does an excellent job fighting the twins and agents.<br />Carrie Moss did an excellent job WHILE PREGNANT in real life. <br />Okay now for the plot: Very thought provoking. It makes you wonder if that is how we have set up our lives to be controlled by machines. It is really speaking of gloablization and mcdonalization relating to changes in technology. What would happen if your computer simply took over and made a Virtual Reality and meanwhile you're really sleeping your life away. many of us are doing this without the help of technology. This movie is a wake up call for anyone interested in getting back to being self actualize. All right I am speaking a lot of psychological terms but the movie really makes you think of SELF.<br />Every movie has some slow spots and this movie did get slow at some places but it always made up for the powerful fighting scenes. Plus if you get the game you are connected to even more of the movie and understand more what EVERYONE's role was.<br />I am pleased. And I will be adding this movie to my DVD collections. I hope you do too.

It provides the audience some Hard Rock style, such as &quot;Black Dog&quot;, &quot;Rock And Roll&quot;, and some others, following &quot;The Battle Of Evermore&quot; which is a type of creative style. Jimmy Page and his band have done an awesome job of duo's that, then connect songs. This band has taken all their songs to a different level, and created their best album, &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot;. This is absolutely worth listening to, the bands duo's, guitar-playing, and singing.
0060934913|4.0|Tony Bourdain is certainly entertaining.  I happen to enjoy smart-... New Yorker commentary and those who do will like this book too.  It basically traces his career as a chef, sprinkling in his insights and warnings on the restaurant industry.  Some of its fascinating, most of its interesting, and some of it comes across as a bit self serving.<br />It is hard to believe that food was ever served in some of these kitchens with all the alleged fighting, drinking, drug use, and fornication.  At times, this comes across as one big locker room story, that one believes at age 12, but by age 16, one immediately knows is embellished, if not totally made up.  The book runs out of steam towards the end, and a few chapters come across as filler.<br />Still, it is entertaining enough to recommend.  However, if you have to read one Bourdain book on food, read \\"A Cook's Tour\\".  It's more about the food, and less about Bourdain.
B000089RVX|5.0|I've listened to this album virtually nonstop since May, when I first discovered it, and it still sounds as fresh and interesting as the first time--maybe even more so.  I hadn't heard of Evanescence before seeing the video for &quot;Bring Me To Life,&quot; and when I bought the album, I expected the other tracks to be in the same vein as that song.  Had that been the case, the album would still have been excellent.  But what I encountered was a diverse range of songs, each unique in its own way.  &quot;My Immortal&quot; blew me away the first time I heard it and, in fact, still does--partly because it is so different from the driving rock of \\"Going Under\\" and \\"Bring Me To Life\\" that opens the album.<BR> <BR>More than the wonderful diversity of their songs, Evanescence can make MUSIC--music that is complex and layered and textured and lush, music that has depth and substance.  I saw an interview with Amy Lee where she mentions her and Ben's range of musical interests, running the gamut from classical and opera to hard rock; all those influences come through here.  That's why listening to the album over and over is so worthwhile, because each time you inevitably discover a new element or nuance of this or that song.  Just listen to a song like &quot;My Last Breath&quot; (especially about two minutes into it), and you'll know what I mean by complex--a really cool guitar line, drums, strings, and haunting vocals combine to amazing effect.  No one else, as far as I know, is making music like this today.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|This CD is incredible, If you are a Maiden Fan, this is a must have, it combines every aspect of Maidens long illustrious career. Most of the songs are 6 minutes longer or greater which I feel gives all three guitarists a chance to stretch it out and show the different skills of each guitarist. This CD is produced by Kevin Shirley of Dream Theater fame, He also Produced &quot;Brave New World&quot; He did a great job on it, and has extended that run with this CD, It is very well recorded. Great writing, Great music, Legendary Band, I'm biased though, I'm a huge Maiden Maniac, Maiden Forever!
B00006G8G1|3.0|This DVD is visually great, fast cuts from many camera angles and a general sense of the size of the show. The problem with this DVD is in the audio mix. I run typical 5.1DD in bitstream through a fiber optic cable. In doing so, I have Janick's guitar coming full-blast through the center channel (see other reviews on that issue)and Bruce's voice, in fine form, is banished to a half-volume hell somewhere between the front speakers with the crowd screaming through the rear speakers. The crowd often drowns out Bruce entirely. There is a solution, however. Switching from bitstream to PCM downgrades the surround sound to Dolby Pro-Logic (limiting my amount of adjustable variables, delay etc.) and puts Bruce back to proper level in the center channel. An otherwise classic live performance, albatross withstanding.
B000089RVX|5.0|I first heard of Evanescence on a commercial, and then I heard an audio stream of theirs on the web; I liked it, so I bought their cd.  It's sort of like a moving mix of rock and trance; that's how I'd describe it.  Different tracks on the CD are relaxing, others are stimulating...this CD has a great mix.
B0000AM6LY|5.0|I adore it...I have all the Simply Red CD's..this one is just incredible...Enough said... didn't like the cover photo or any of the pictures...too posy and waxy looking.....nevermind..the music is more than 5 stars. When is Simply Red coming to the Caribbean??????????????????????????
B00007G207|5.0|This edition, which contains a significant amount of footage that didn't make it to the original will prove to be a treat to those of us that smiled and cried to the 1990 version. Very few movies have had the effect on me that this film by Italian director Tornatore (Siamo Tutti Bene, Malena, Legend of 1900) had. I guess it's the mix of the exquisite score by Maestro Ennio Morricone and the sadness of the story, but it is one of the few movies that will pull a tear out of my eye, no matter how many times I've seen it.<br />It's hauntingly beautiful, as Sicilian-born Toto, grows through his childhood and teenage years to become what he's dreamed of, to finally learn that all that matters is true love when he finally finds runs into his first great love. His whole life continues to revolve around the memories it evokes as he grows to become a successful filmaker away from his hometown.<br />If you don't understand a word of Italian, fine, because along with the subtitles, the actors are incredible at conveying the tons of feelings their characters go through. Give it a shot and you will not be dissapointed. It's one of those touching stories that will always live as a classic in your heart once you view it.
B000089RVX|2.0|Unique?<br />The Gathering and Lacuna Coil have been making the same &quot;type&quot; of music (Heavy music + enchanting female voclas) for almost a decade.<br />And they're much better at it. (including Aneke's voice)<br />The only thing this band did was to go mainstream and be MTV-Marketable.
B00005QK39|5.0|In the genre of prog rock, one of the norms is that debut albums tend to be rougher in terms of their sound, with more &quot;edges&quot; in a sense. Granted that Marillion came out with very clear influences (a musical advantage, so to speak) stemming from Pink Floyd, Genesis, Yes and even King Crimson, this, their debut album sounded very polished, serving as an exquisite musical framework to Fish's very particular lyrics and voice.<br />Though the band in their Fish period has been almost inextricably tied to the Scottsman (so much, that when he departed in 88, most people deemed them doomed to breaking up), the strength of the band beyond Fish has been present in their music since day one, giving enough room for each member to contribute to his fullest. An example of this are the guitar solos Steve Rothery delivers for the opening track and &quot;Chelsea Monday,&quot; Mark Kelly's upbeat keyboards in &quot;Garden Party,&quot; Pete Trewavas' characteristic bass line all through &quot;Chelsea Monday&quot; hand in hand with Rothery's mourning guitar and even the drum work of short-lived Marillion member Mick Pointer (he would only be a part of the band until the recording of this album).<br />The way I see it, this album, along with their &quot;single&quot; prior to it (&quot;Grendel,&quot; which fortunately is part of the Disc 2 on this remastered edition of the original 1983 album) constitute the band's formal tribute to their predecessors, serving as a musical platform for what the band would later show to the world, peaking in 1986 with the genius of the concept album 'Misplaced Childhood,' which introduced most of the bands fan base to them, thanks to the more radio-oriented single &quot;Kayleigh.&quot; In a sense, after 'Script...' the comparisons between them and the groups that influenced them more directly would become more subtle, making room in the fans' ears and hearts for what would become the Marillion sound.
0743216458|5.0|After reading the late Stephen Ambrose's book about D-Day, I became an instant fan of his books about American soldiers in the European Theater of Operations.  Ambrose's focus on the GIs is, throughout his books, balanced with glimpses of the larger picture, giving the reader a fascinating insight into what the last 11 months of World War II were like for the soldiers.<br />Band of Brothers tells the story of a single company of paratroopers in the 101st Airborne Division from training in the United States and England to the end of the European campaign in May of 1945.  The book depicts Co. E's personnel with an unblinking eye, depicting its first commander as a humorless martinet who nevertheless made Easy Company into a unit.  It also tells how Richard Winters, the exec, took command of the company after its second commander became a casualty.  From Normandy's hedgerows to Hitler's Alpine hideaway, Ambrose follows the 120 or so men of this small elite outfit, taking readers along on an unforgettable journey.
B000000Y1H|5.0|Granted that this music is not (never was intended to be) easy listening (you wouldn't want to play it on a romantic evening or on your way to work, if that's what you'd want a jazz album for), it's not free jazz either, and therefore it is a lot easier to digest these days than it was when it girst came on in 1957.<br />Now, Monk's work is something you have to LISTEN to or you will miss what he's there to share with you. Other jazz albums you can leave in the background and they will work just fine: I've tried that with, say, David Brubeck, and it works well, but somehow, with Monk it doesn't work: he demands your attention, and it seems if he can't \\"have it\\" it will almost become annoying to listen to.<br />This was Thelonious Monk's breakthrough album after ten years as a recording artist and it features the talents and original works of Monk alongside Sonny Rollins on tenor sax, Max Roach on drums (an incidentally on timpani), Oscar Pettiford/Paul Chambers (Miles Davis) on bass, Ernie Henry on alto, and Clark Terry on trumpet for the closing track. These musicians were demanded by Monk in the album as much as you will when you are listening through this work, but get ready for a great musical ride! No wonder Coltrane once said about him: \\"I always had to be alert with [him]... because if you didn't keep aware all the time of what was going on, you'd suddenly feel as if you'd stepped into an empty elevator shaft.\\"
6305736650|5.0|(To the reader: This review is about the original MGM DVD release and NOT about the 2-disc edition just released.)<br />Casablanca!<br />The very name conjures up an exotic mix of adventure, intrigue, heroism, selfless sacrifice, and romance.  Hear the title of this 1942 Best Picture winner and your memory will provide you with images of Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid, Dooley Wilson, Peter Lorre, and Claude Rains.  Or maybe you'll hear snatches of Max Steiner's unforgettable score, with its interpolation of Herman Hupfeld's \\"As Time Goes By\\" and the stirring strains of \\"The Marsellaise.\\"<br />Based on the stage play \\"Everybody Comes to Rick's\\" by Murray Burnett and Joan Allison, the movie tells a dramatic story of refugees fleeing from wartorn Europe and making a perilous trip to Casablanca in French Morocco. It is December 1941 and that French colony is under the control of \\"unoccupied France.\\"  Ostensibly neutral in World War II, Vichy France is nevertheless a German vassal state, as the arrival of Major Strasser (Conrad Veldt) clearly demonstrates.<br />Strasser's mission in Casablanca: to stop Czech underground leader Victor Laszlo (Henreid) from obtaining one of two exit visas stolen from two murdered German couriers and escaping from the Gestapo. Having tracked the defiant Laszlo after his escape from a Nazi concentration camp, Strasser is determined to capture the symbol of anti-Nazi resistance once and for all.<br />Accompanying Laszlo is the beautiful Ilsa Lund (Bergman), a young Norweigan student whom he married in secret before he was captured by the Gestapo in 1940. Devoted to her husband and his great cause, Ilsa has been at his side since Laszlo's miraculous escape and sudden reappearance in Paris.<br />Unbeknownst to Laszlo, however, his fate will now rest in the hands of American saloonkeeper Rick Blaine (Bogart).  In the months following Victor's escape from the concentration camp he was reported as \\"presumed dead.\\" In loneliness and despair, the grieving Ilsa met and fell in love with Rick in Paris shortly before the German occupation began.  For a brief time the lovers were together, only to tragically part ways when news of Laszlo's return reached Ilsa.<br />Now, in the eve of America's entry into World War II, Victor Laszlo's fate hangs on the conflicting emotions felt by both Rick and Ilsa, as well as the shifting loyalties of French police Capt. Louis Renault (Rains).<br />The screenplay by Julius J. and Philip G. Epstein and Howard Koch is a wonderful mixture of romance, intrigue, drama and comedy (the latter provided both by colorful characters and witty exchanges). Director Michael Curtiz and producer Hal B. Wallis made Casablanca as one of many movies produced in 1942, never knowing that it would become a classic of Hollywood's Golden Era.despair, the grieving Ilsa met and fell in love with Rick in Paris shortly before the German occupation began.

0780624890|1.0|I cannot believe I wasted my time on this movie.  It was such a disapointment.  There was barely any dialogue.  Wesley Snipes said, what, maybe 5 words in the whole movie. The ending didn't even make sense.  I don't even know why they bothered making a sequel to this terrible movie.  I only wish I could give this movie 0 stars.  This was a ridiculous, cheesy, big fat waste of money of a movie.
B00005B58Y|4.0|This marks an historic occasion in my reviewing history...I disagree with a favorite reviewer, Mr. Sam Chell. And when folks get slammed for a 4 star review...well, Miles definately does bring out the feelings. No, I am not partial to this &quot;middle child&quot;, as Mr. Chell so aptly puts it. To my ear, this one seems to meander - not the tunes, but the statements; All except for Cannonball, who seems to be able to do no wrong. I don't know, this one simply doesn't move me like the others. &quot;Two Bass Hit&quot; sounds like it was recorded in a different studio than the first few cuts. I can see the 0-fers already! The second half of the CD does pick up considerably, starting with &quot;Miles&quot;, and &quot;Billy Boy&quot; have Red, Paul, and Philly doing their thing, and doing it well - my favorite cut. Trane's best, to me, comes on &quot;Miles&quot;, while Philly Joe keeps it good and steady with the rim click. Like I said - 4 star - just not, to me, up there with the best of the best.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|I would rightly rate this album at four and a half stars, but had to give it a five, as four and a half is not an option. This will probably be the average customer rating eventually, like I saw at Amazon UK website.<BR> Dance of Death, is another great album by Iron Maiden, even bettering the previous album- Brave New World, which I would rate at four stars. Iron Maiden do not give the punchy spectacular heavy metal performances they gave on their 80s albums, but the quality of music is still intact though more subtle and somber with emotional and touchy tunes in the last two albums.<BR> The album kicks of with a good track that has a punchy chorus, which would not have been that good if not for Bruce Dickinson (.I'm on my way...). The second song is really a great composition- Rainmaker. Listening to Bruce Dickinson sing is always a pleasure.<BR>Dave Murray, full applause to him, composed Rainmaker. The third song written by the revered bandleader Steve Harris is also a good song with Dickinson reaching a high pitch while singing out the title of the song- `No More Lies'. `Montsegur', the next number in the album is really fresh and different coming from Iron Maiden, the last 2 parts of the lead guitars being very emotional and appealing. The title song `Dance of Death' did not impress me much; neither did the next track- `Gates of Tomorrow'. `New Frontier' has come out well in my view. `Panchandale' is another sorrowful song well written and composed. `Face in the Sand' has a terrific drumming performance, a good song with Dickinson singing at a high octave through out the song. I did not like the last two songs of the album very much.<BR> I have been romancing Iron Maiden for 13 years now and have always been my favorite since I heard the album `7th son of a 7th son' which was the second album of Maiden I listened to. I think they are Musicians of the finest quality not even second to `The Beatles' or Jimi Hendrix. I know how great they are all. Iron Maiden hasalso outlived their time frame in my view. The band is 25 yrs old now, a sextet with its members over 45. This is one band, which is great for what they used to be, and what they are even today, cannot think of any other band that has been good for so long. Thirteen studio albums by Iron Maiden so far. The only album that let me down was `Virtual IX', it was also the only album by Maiden that did not enter the top 10 positions on the UK charts and stood at 16th. I wrote the band off after listening to the album `Virtual IX', but was forced to consider them again when I heard `Brave New World'.
B0000047CX|5.0|This is, unquestionably one of the great pairings of all time, both artistically, and commercially. No doubt, the last minute 'lark' inclusion of Gilberto's then-wife, Astrud, on two tunes was a huge part of the commercial success, but it is Stan and Joao (with Jobim's cool piano arrangements and tunes) that make this one so amazing. &quot;The Sound&quot; REALLY got the sound on this recording! Joao's always understated vocals (he sings with more confidence on his own recordings I've noticed) and his driving samba guitar - well up in the mix, as it should be - are the perfect match for Getz' ultra-cool tenor, although &quot;Doralice&quot; as well as &quot;So Danco Samba&quot; find Stan really taking it to another level. Suprisingly, this was not the first 'bossa nova' recording I ever heard. Somehow, &quot;The Sound Of Ipanema&quot; with Carlos Lyra and a very young Paul Winter got to me first. Winter played it straight with the melody (sort of like Astrud does with Jobim's melody lines) but Lyra's songs and voice captivated me. For those who love the genre, and not just for wistful nostalgia, should look for Lyra's best, coming out soon on a compilation import.
0064471837|5.0|*laughs*  I got into this book because of the cover.  Seriously.  The artist was the same as drew the cover to another of my favorite books, Wise Child, and the name intrigued me.  So, I asked for it for Christmas my 7th grade year... and it's been one of my favorites ever since!<br />I've re-read Sabriel... oh, 3 or 4 times now and forced my friends to read it as well.  Most liked it though a few found it too 'dark'.  And for good reason.  Sabriel is about Death, and the people who work in and with it, the necromancers.  People die, dead things come to life, and blood is cruelly spilled.<br />All of this is made tangible through the beautifully wroght descriptions and characterizations, and all the fantastical elements are handled with such a normalcy that it is easy at times to believe there is a strange, magical kingdom to the north... where I would go in an instant if I could.  Overall, it's one of the best written novels I've read in a long while, particuarly of this genre, and here I am a college student and still loving this book as much as I did the first time I read it, during classes even I was so enthralled.  *guilty grin*<br />Read Sabriel.  You won't regret it.
6304806418|5.0|I love this movie because its very funny. Che is very sexy and Evita is very convincing
B0000BYM3K|2.0|I just don't understand. These guys are capable of so much and they write their worst album since, well, ever. It's very cheesy at times. Cheesy is a very bad thing. And why can't we leep into the 2000's on production. How about some crisp drums and crunchy guitars. And how about less keyboards. Anyone who calls this the best Iron Maiden ever obviously never listened to Number Of The Beast or Powerslave. The only song that saves it is track no. 9. Sorry I can't remember the name of track 9, because I left the cd out in my car where it will sit until I sell it at the used cd store. Don't waste your money!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|At first when I heard Wildest Dreams, I hated it. I thought that this album was going to [be bad]. Then I bought it.....<BR>I still think that Wildest Dreams is the worst song on the album, but songs like Rainkmaker, Montsegur, and Face In the Sand make up for it. Not to mention the two epic tracks Paschendale and the title track Dance of Death are absolutely amazing and show the best of the new Iron Maiden music.<BR>What I find I like the most of this entire album is the last track titled Journeyman. I very well done song that shows the diversity of this band. The slowest Maiden song in years, showcases the guitar talent of Gers, Murray, and Smith plus the bass of Harris, and amazing vocals by Dickinson.<BR>Overall : 4.5 stars.<BR>It might take a little while to get used to the album, but once you listen to it once, you really do find that you cant get it out of your mind. I dont think its as good as Brave New World, but its right up there as one of my favorite Maiden albums ever.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Many people who have accomplished great things also have personal lives that would not hold up under the \\"white glove\\" test. Certainly this is true of Johnny Cash, who, by the way, also accomplished the *immensely* difficult task of rebuilding a life that he had nearly destroyed by being an addict.<br />Those who believe that only squeaky-clean musicians deserve accolades should be sentenced to a music collection full of Pat Boone and Marie Osmond. (But, hey, wait a minute -- didn't she get divorced? Oooooohh, *she's* not going to heaven!)<br />I'm not a Bible scholar by any stretch of the imagination, but this verse from the Book of Matthew, Chapter 7, Verse 5, says it all to me: Before tending to the mote in thy neighbor's eye, consider the beam in thine own.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Johnny Cash's last CD is an enormous testament the man's talent and vision.  To the clearly uneducated fools who continue to disparage the man and his legacy, the so-called 'music fans' that are just slandering The Man's reputation here on Amazon.com: there is no way you can truly be a 'music fan' and not understand Cash's monumental stature in American music.  You shame yourselves.  Johnny Cash is irreplaceable; his voice, his honest understanding of the folkways and people of this land, ARE America.  He will be sorely missed, and I guarantee that when I listen to 'Hurt' later today, I will be crying my eyes out.
B00008O31H|4.0|The definitive answer for what the Black Keys are reminiscent of is Blue Cheer, the late 60's band responsible for the muddily chaotic electro-fuzz version of Summertime Blues.  <br />I am thrilled and amazed that a band would throw this sound out in this age and the singer is a terrific soul singer.  Ahhh...a terrific soul singer backed by a near incompetent sludge band.  <br />The playing is clumsy, but soulful, however, the songwriting is solid.  <br />Only 4 stars because some of the songs aren't up to the standard set by Hard Row and Set You Free, but the approach is so fresh that I have little to grumble about.

I'm hooked.<br />The DaVinci Code is fun, smart and just keeps you guessing.  Althought you might see some twists coming a few pages ahead, you are just pulled in the story.  I couln'd put it down.  I think you will enjoy it if you like mysteries and/or history.<br />Enjoy!
B000006NPY|5.0|It took me a while to really get into this cd, because i was more into basic rock at the time. At a talent show in my school, 2 kids played Tear, from this cd, but I did not catch the title when they played it. All i remember is that the song stayed in my head and i couldn't stop thinking about it. So at a thrift shop, i found M.C. and the I.S for 5 bucks, and got it. It became my all time favorite cd. Next i got Simese Dream, the one that was supposed to be the best. I didn't think it came close to M.C. though, but it was ok. Then I got Machina, and that became my favorite cd of all time. Basically, it was older pumpkins more mature. Adore came next, and like I said, it took me a while to really get in to it. But one day i popped it into my cd player, and i actually listened to it for the first time, i didn't just hear it. The songs on this album seemed like they spent a lot more time writing them. Billy Corgan wrote some of his most personal lyrics, and the music was amazing. To Shelia starts off with that nylon-stringed acousic riff, and the song just bulids into a musical masterpiece. Definatly my favorite song on the album. Next comes the 2 radio songs like the gothicy Ava Adore, and the 1979ish Perfect. Both great songs for radio, which makes me only wonder why this album wasn't more popular in sales (like it matters anyway). Then comes Daphne Desends, another song that i think could of been on the radio. Once Upon a Time reminds me of Gish for some reason, maybe because the guitar sounds similar. Tear, the first Pumpkins song i ever heard is next, which sounds like one of the saddest songs ever written. Crestfallen is simply one of the greatest songs ever written, and Appels and Oranjes is great with that electronic drum beat and wonderful synth and guitar. Pug is another song that sounds really gothic, and i think that might of even mmade it on the radio. The Tale of Dusty and P. Pete could of fit in on M.C. Annie-Dog is extremely fun to play on the guitar,just using the piano chords. Shame is a masterpiece written to the death of the late INXS singer, and Behold! the Night Mare is another one of my favorites on the album. For Martha is the beautiful song Billy wrote for the death of his mother, and 17 is just 17 seconds of the b- side Blissed and Gone. All in all, i think later on down the road this cd will make more sence to people, and maybe they will finally listen to it rather then just hear it. One more note, check out some of the songs that didn't make the album. Waiting, Soot and Stars, Eye, and Once in a While are definatly worth getting, but to be sure get them all.
B000002H97|2.0|I tend to enjoy this album the most when I need nothing more than a commercially appealing song written in the key of E (there are 12 of them here) and songs with solos that over-utilise the wah pedal (again, there are 12) not to mention a drummer than hits cymbals on unexpected beats (*sigh* this can be found on all 12 tracks here) and PICKED bass guitar (you guessed it).<br />Buy this album. But whatever you do, don't download any songs from it. The poor starving souls who recorded it couldn't possibly be ripped off any more by you, oh cruel one.
0385504209|4.0|Wow!  Two stories in one book...one is a fictional murder mystery with puzzles and riddles while another is based on true biographical/historical artifact and documentary.  A great read that was hard to put down.  Enjoyable and fascinating if one hasn't been privy to the real Knights Templar story and the Holy Grail.  It made my head spin!
B00006690G|1.0|If a toothache could be released on record, this would be it.

B00005N5S5|4.0|I'm sure most reviewers have given some background information about the storyline of Terminator Spec. Ed but I will focus on the audio. I'm sure the fans of T1 are perhaps more into the original movie and like this film best of the 3 T's. This is where I want to give you notice: The audio is in a newly- mastered digital 5.1 stereo with the option for the original mono. I deducted a star for 1) how the digital stereo was enhanced and 2) the quality of the original mono.<br />I was expecting that the new digital stereo would be a careful tweak of the original audio. And that is negative. The original mono has a cool sound of what seems like swords interacting with each other at the opening title. You hear it about 2- 3 times in mono, but for whatever &quot;earthly&quot; reason, the sound effect was deleted from the digital sound. Also, the experts placed the sound of a helicopter as the scene changed to where the stray dog walks through the streets and the camera moves into the alley for the scene with the homeless man, whose words were somewhat lost by the helicopter noise. There were absolutely no helicopter sounds at all in the original audio.<br />I shook my head that the experts wanted to place additional sound fx into this classic. That's one reason I had to deduct from this DVD, whose video is cleaned up and has a more dramatic feel. The black level was darkened... My original experience with the Terminator video from a while ago was that the overall picture seemed muddy, which resulted in a lack of saturation, but this picture quality was much better, and had more contrast, which is needed for adding to the effect of dread.<br />If you've never seen the movie before, I'm sure you'll appreciate the newly- enhanced and updated stereo. If you're a TRUE Terminator fanatic, you'll be slightly dismayed of the new insertions of audio that the producers felt we needed to have to help us enjoy a movie that really doesn't need much more since it was near- perfect already.<br />As for the mono audio, I'm glad they kept this option with the movie. However, the audio could have been tweaked a bit better, because it seemed rather flat. The highs just weren't crisp enough. With a good mono track, it can almost mimic stereo, but the treble just puttered.<br />So, 3 stars would be too harsh, and 5 aren't deserved because of the audio issues, to me.eady.<br />As for the mono audio, I'm glad they kept this option with the movie.

B00005JLD4|5.0|This raw adaptation of a true story about one of Australia's more shameful historical periods is exquisite, to say the least. The account of Molly, Gracie, and Daisy would be over-the-top, if one did not realize that this was indeed a true story. In an effort to &quot;purify&quot; races and gradually eliminate the continent's aboriginal peoples (all under the guise of &quot;bettering their prospects&quot; -- yeah, right), a white organization ludicrously created for the &quot;Protection&quot; of natives ends up destroying lives, families, and an entire culture with the kind of systematic fervor and idiocy that can only emanate from racist bureacracies. The three children in question are brutally taken from their bush-dwelling mother to be &quot;re-programmed&quot; at a filthy outback concentration camp run by white-clad nun-types who force the children to sing English American Slave plantation songs. The girls escape and, led by the clever Molly, journey hundreds of treacherous miles on foot in a seemingly impossible attempt to reunite with their mother. The story consumed the Australian newspapers at the time and this adaptation wisely chooses reality over sentimentality. Its earthiness and even-handed direction are sadly lacking from most modern indie films. An absolute winner, from the Peter Gabriel score, to the performances, to the cinematography. Kenneth Branaugh does a grand job of making the viewer despise his character's very existence. The conclusion is bittersweet, and the last frame in which two of the sisters appear as they are today in very, very old age is a look into the eyes of sheer human dignity. A treasure.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|Bought it the day it came out.  It is a good Maiden album.  I got what I paid for, however, I'm looking for the day where Steve puts the pen down and lets Bruce, Adrian, and Genick determine the sound and feel of the next album.  Bruce does sound great, but he seems to be a shade weaker than Brave New World.  Any Maiden fan should enjoy this, and be thankful that at least one band does sound like they are supposed to sound.
B000002U9Y|5.0|Nobody believed they could do it--not even their original management, who abandoned them in favor of Syd Barrett, who now found it impossible to function within the band due to problems that included drugs.  \\"Jugband Blues\\" definitely captures the state he was in, as well as (I think) awareness of his being phased out.  Although I personally don't like this song, it certainly sets the stage for the rest of the album, which aside from one amazing and unique feature, forecasts Pink Floyd's later directions with great accuracy.<br />I feel that Pink Floyd's survival after this blow is owed not to one person, but TWO, who could hardly be more opposite: Richard Wright and Roger Waters.  One might even (if you allow me a bit of poetic license with my usage of the terms) call them \\"yin\\" and \\"yang\\" respectively.  With new guitarist David Gilmour still trying to find his place in the band, having not yet developed an independent style, quiet-natured Richard Wright brought his already-established Eastern-tinged and innovative musical talents to the table.  Even Roger Waters' \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\" owes a heavy debt to his keyboarding.  Mr. Wright also makes extensive songwriting contributions, including the gorgeous, haunting \\"Remember a Day\\" and the relaxing (NOT boring, thank you very much!) \\"See-Saw\\", both of which he wrote on his own.  Also remarkable is his vocal contribution.  The remaining half of the excellent Barrett-Wright vocal duo very nearly made his soft, melodic, and unique voice THE voice of Pink Floyd here.  In fact, to my ear, he made it onto *every* track except \\"Jugband Blues\\", although the title track is arguable (duet, Mr. Gilmour, or Mr. Wright?) and \\"Set the Controls\\" is hard to tell.  All I can say on the latter is, compare the faint \\"aaaahh\\" bit to the same place on Live at Pompeii where Mr. Gilmour is clearly doing it, or Ummagumma Live, where Mr. Waters does it, to the \\"aaaahh\\" at the beginning of \\"Far from the Harbour Wall\\" onRick Wright's Broken China, and tell me which the studio version sounds more like.<br />Pink Floyd's \\"yang\\" force, the outspoken Roger Waters, brought his lyrical skills to the table with lyrics to \\"Corporal Clegg\\" (shades of The Wall?), \\"Set the Controls\\" (\\"Will he remember the lesson of giving?\\"), and I think also \\"Let There Be More Light\\".  However, Mr. Waters seems, oddly enough, the more tentative of the opposite RW's on this album, perhaps because he was still working on finding his voice.  On ASoS he relies heavily on outside influences such as Syd Barrett and Chinese poetry.  That said, however, his is a worthy contribution.  <br />Nick Mason fans get a rare chance to hear him in full Eastern-psychedelic glory in the studio setting, most notably on \\"Set the Controls\\" and the apparent forerunner of Echoes (far more so than \\"Atom Heart Mother\\"), \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\".  Lyrically, all three writers are turning away from the Piper-era whimsy towards nostalgia(in Mr. Wright's case) and madness (in Mr. Waters and Mr. Barrett's cases), although some of the psychedelic, free-form style remains.<br />Those of you who have not heard Piper or Relics may be shocked to hear the severe recording-equipment limitations the Floyd suffered from in their early days--this is down to their label, in my opinion, which underfunded them.  This, along with my dislike of \\"Jugband Blues\\" are why I dock the rating of this album half a star.  But as both are due to difficult, uncontrollable circumstances, and the band DOES come through them well, I give them the full 5 stars rather than rounding down.  Overall, this album is a must-have for any Pink Floyd fan's collection.  It was truly a unique moment in their history--never again would yin and yang experience such synergy with *both* virtually in \\"command\\".

Master of puppets will always seem like it's been recorded today. it's sound never wears out, you never get tired of it, it always sounds 'new'. i still (believe it or not) expect metallica to once again, do something similar to this or 'justice...' but meanwhile i've got this otherworldly album which i (and a few millions of metallifans) consider to be the band's best. after several years of listening to it, i still get a broad and stupid ear to ear smile at the sound of each of the album's 8 thrashy symphonies. Hail!
B000002C1V|4.0|If the music of The Wall is \\"un-Floydian\\" in comparison to their earlier works, then The Final Cut is a near-complete departure.  With Richard Wright completely forced out of the band, Nick Mason no longer drumming on all tracks of an album, and even David Gilmour's creative input severely curtailed (he even chose to have his production credits removed on this one), TFC was indeed \\"by Roger Waters, performed by [part of] Pink Floyd.\\"  As a Pink Floyd album, TFC falls short--drained of the others' influence, it merits in extremely strong lyrics and use of effects, but gone are the elaborate chord structures and moments where the music is left to speak for itself.  As a Floyd album, TFC earns only a 3.<br />However--if viewed as a Roger Waters solo album, TFC not only earns a 5, but is in my opinion his greatest work ever.  Not even Amused to Death tops this achievement.    Although many songs on TFC were outtakes from The Wall, the feeling they give me is entirely different--here, underneath the bitterness and bluster, is the sensitive, scared, and soulful Roger Waters.  Nowhere else does Mr. Waters allow himself to be vulnerable to this degree.  From his deepest idealism (\\"Take heed of the dream...\\") to his deepest fears (\\"And if I open my heart to you, show you my weak side, what would you do?\\"), to realizing the futility of bitterness (\\"We were all equal in the end...\\") he has laid bare his soul.  This is a rare occasion where he is not just blunt--but honest.  These lyrics--particularly the title track--expose what lies behind the wall, and that final deep, secret yearning: \\"Could anybody love [me]?  Or is it just a crazy dream!?\\"<br />The sound production is nothing short of magnificent, topping The Wall, rivaling Amused to Death.  The vocals are easily Mr. Waters' best ever.  Ranging from angered to anguished, spiteful to soulful, what he lacks in pitch control he makes up in passion.  Yet even his technique seems improved, in places taking on a delicacy and subtlety he has never repeated.  Musically, one must not forget the accomplishments of guitarist David Gilmour--although he is not given any credits, his solos are the match of Mr. Waters' impassioned vocals.  The third figure I believe deserves far greater credit that he is given--that is Michael Kamen, the man responsible for the gorgeous orchestrations that almost...almost...make even me forget the absence in the band.<br />But ultimately, I cannot forget.  There are places where the piano and organ work are woefully uninspired.  Even Mr. Wright's partial presence on The Wall was more *alive* than this.  The piano playing is not bad, really, but as a listener I found myself wondering if Mr. Kamen was told note-for-note what to play, espeically after hearing his much livelier performance on the David Gilmour in Concert DVD.  But by far, the biggest problem comes from the Hammond organ.  Nowhere is it more obviously dead than on \\"Your Possible Pasts\\".  Never have I heard this normally beautiful instrument emit such a toneless, dry, and lifeless sound.  This is where the hole in Pink Floyd gapes so wide that one almost could almost fall through it.  Listen to Mr. Wright's masterful Hammond playing on Animals to hear what could have been.  It just about hurts.<br />That said, I do award TFC a composite rating of 4--a mediocre 3 stars as a \\"Floyd\\" effort, but a magnificent 5 stars as a Roger Waters effort.  The perception depends entirely on which approach you take.  I hope that, whichever side you are on, this review has helped you to a decision appropriate to your tastes.
B00000IL67|5.0|5 hours of alice cooper, more than 80 songs including rare, unreleased tracks, a concise book with everything you need to know about the man (historical, quotes, interviews, and this superbly designed box... people complained that not all his classics were included here; come on guys, the man has done something like 25 studio recordings! how can you expect to find all you want in four cd's? what can i say about this hard rock mammoth that hadnt been said? he's the father of goth rock, shock theater, corpse paint and heavy metal in general and his songs have some of the most intelligent lyrics you'll ever hear. again, dont expect this collection to sum up the entire alice cooper, so you might want to get a few additional studio albums (welcome to my nightmare, the last temptation, school's out and some videoes). however you'll find everything which made alice the rock icon he is now: satire, urban legends, excess under all its forms, 'american' values, puritanism, politics, romance,... it's all in here and i'm sure you'll only grow to love it and love the insanely creative person/band behind it.
B000089RVX|1.0|..other than that, it is standard, boring pop/hard rock that never goes anywhere, partly due to the repetitive nature every song follows. It's like a pop interpretation of Lacuna Coil/Within Temptation and those bands aren't that good to begin with.<br />An earlier reviewer wrote, \\"It should be a crime to not own this cd.\\", while actually one should be so dumb to not know of the aforementioned bands(among others) that explored the dark side and brought beauty in ways previously unheard of. <br />Evanescence now gets the credit for doing a rehash of other band's original ideas and dumbs it down for the AMERICAN PUVLIC to swallow. And it worked!<br />Unbelievable.
630326669X|5.0|This video is a great insight into the construction of a great song. The magic of Keith Richards &amp; Mick Jaggar in pulling the song together is a must see. On early attempts of the song you would think they would give it away but to their credit they persist and create the song of the century .. well in my books at least. The weird clips in between the recording sessions are very weird. I suspect they could be used as an anti-drugs message .. highly recommended

It's one of those c.d's that every song is different and interesting, not like others where all the songs sound the same.

0440416027|5.0|Michael hadn't really wanted to move to the creepy old house on Falconer Road, but his parents were determined to have more space for their growing family.  The real estate agent had somehow convinced his parents that the old house was a real fixer upper and so Michael, instead of spending all day playing soccer with his friends, Leakey & Coot, was helping clear the garden and work on the house.  He knew that his parents were really worried about his new baby sister, who was born early and was not doing very well.  She was allowed to come home from the hospital, but had to return when she had trouble breathing.  His mom and dad could think of nothing but the baby and Michael was left to his own devices.<br />His parents warned him not to go into the rickety old garage left standing on the property, but Michael couldn't resist exploring.  What he found in the old garage astounded him - he found a kind of man in the corner.  The man didn't seem to be able to carry on a normal conversation and Michael wasn't sure what to do, but he brought him food and tried to talk to him.  Michael also made friends with Mina, the independent and free spirited girl who lived next door.  Mina was different than anyone else that Michael had ever known and he wasn't sure that was necessarily a good thing.  But Michael needed to know that he wasn't going crazy, so he showed the man to Mina.  Between Mina and Michael, they were able to give Skellig, the strangely winged man, a new chance at life and to change their own lives forever.<br />This was a fascinating book.  It is very different from most other children's books and did a superb job at conveying Michael's feelings of loneliness and alienation by the way that he described things in the story.  It was interesting to get to know Michael as he progressed from being worried about how the move affected his life to worrying about his new baby sister and whether she would ever be able to come home.  Skellig was a very different character and the reader never really does learn what or who he is.  It is like real life in that way, mysteries are not always solved and life is colored in shades of gray.  This is a great book for discussion with children or something that adults will enjoy reading on their own and thinking about.and the reader never really does learn what or who he is.

0380715430|2.0|I, like others, have thoroughly enjoyed many of Bryson's other works. A SHORT HISTORY OF NEARLY EVERYTHING seemed penned by a different mind.  The book covers an important topic - English and its history and future.  Yet, despite the attempts at humor throughout the book, it reads more like a middle school book report.  <br />What galls me is when folks allegedly attempting to educated the general public make factual errors that should have been caught in the research stage.   The Eskimo snow myth could qualify for an Urban Legend, some of the derivatives are WAY off, the FBI has said it CANNOT tell where people are just by the way they speak, and worst - he says Esperanto has no definite articles and then uses one!  Go figure.<br />He is at his best in the historical analysis but it is too abbreviated.  Also well done are his (very) brief looks at the abysmal failure of &quot;created&quot; languages.  These will never prosper since they do not have a support base.  English, he demonstrates, is the most varied, the richest, the most adaptable and the most widely spread language in the world.  It is the new lingua franca.

B0000BYM3K|4.0|Toss out all the grandstanding here -- in favor of AND against Dance of Death. These facts are undeniable about the album:<br />1. Bruce is awesome, but he's 20+ years older than Piece of Mind. Give the guy a break and respect him for the badass that he still is, and stop whining about the badass he WAS because he's not hitting the same notes...<br />2. There are more 3 part harmonies here than on BNW. And the solos are a return to form of sorts, sounding more like &quot;classic&quot; Maiden than BNW.<br />3. There are more longer, drawn out songs here than BNW. Harris would do well to lose the intro/outro disease and whittle down things a bit. When in doubt Steve, simplify. Simplify.<br />4. Nicko's song is no letdown at all! Let's see what else he's got up his sleeve.<br />5. Maiden still have fire and passion, although Harris might be a tad too inflexible with his formulas. I don't know the man and I wasn't there during the songwriting to see if he really runs the show with an &quot;Iron&quot; fist as they say, but holy s**t, Chemical Wedding about blew my d**k off compared to BNW and DOD. I'd like to see Maiden take a stab at &quot;changing musical directions&quot; and experimenting with more visceral songwriting that's free of overproduced embellishments. I get the feeling Adrian and Bruce wish they could &quot;cut loose&quot; more. However, the varied credits on this album suggest the winds of change might be blowing as far as the songwriting goes, so lets all reserve judgement until the next album is released in a few years.<br />6. The question everyone is asking: Can the new revitalized Maiden recapture it's glory, or should we be waiting for Bruce and Adrian to do another kickass solo album? The answer: Hey folks, lighten up and enjoy it all. It could be worse -- they might have retired after the Blaze years. Give it up for these guys and all they've done for us and quit knocking them down.<br />Buy the record. It's great stuff. Or get in your camaro and put on Powerslave. Just enjoy the music and stop being so hypercritical. Enjoy it while it lasts!

0805062971|5.0|One night, when I was a senior in high school, a few friends of mine and I decided to head over to a local cineplex and catch this interesting movie about anarchists, entitled &quot;Fight Club&quot;.  Little did I know that this film would become one of my favorite movies ever.  Finally, a week ago, now well into my college career, I decided to pick up the novel (after reading several of Palahniuk's other works).<br />The first half of the movie and the first half of the book match up pretty well.  The second half diverts, and the endings are completely different.<br />The novel, Fight Club, is essentially a retelling of Faust- one searches for material goods, then knowledge, and then power in a search for fulfillment that can't be had at any price.  This state is brought about by the denial of the feminine, portrayed, in this book, by two characters- Bob Paulson and Marla Singer, who could be seen as the mirror for Gretchen, whereas Tyler Durden takes the Mephistophelian role.  Whereas the movie ultimately culminates in a brutally ironic (and chillingly prophetic) strike against consumerism, the anti-consumerism of the novel is more of an afterthought, the book having more to do with man's denial of himself and the inability to become a hero without pain.<br />While Palahniuk's best novel to date is &quot;Survivor&quot;, &quot;Fight Club&quot; will be the one he's remembered for- a glance into the empty souls of early information-age yuppies, combined with a timeless, existential look at humanity.

Reading about her and her friends and loved ones, her village, and her country, has enriched my life.  Now I want to visit Botswana because McCall Smith, through Precious's eyes, has made the country come alive for me.

0380730367|5.0|I recently read &quot;Mystic River&quot;, my first Lehane book, and loved it, so I thought I would give one of the Kenzie-Gennaro books a try.  I'm so glad I did because &quot;Prayers for Rain&quot; is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  It's got a fast-moving, nail-biting plot and an antagonist so sinister that you'll find you can't turn the pages fast enough.  The dialogue is pitch perfect and the characters are so well written that you'll feel like you know them only a few pages into the book. I can't wait to read the other books in the series.
B000084T18|1.0|I will say it again.  No.  It seems as though all you need is an insurmountable amount of hype to sell records.  This is not music, this is a trend.  Obviously, no one has really listened to this and his extreme lack of lyrical ability.  Because that is the only contribution he made to the album.  He didn't produce anything.  Speaking of producing, the beats were weak too.  I don't even know what this is supposed to be.  How bad is the album?  I'll run through it.  First comes the intro.  Worthless.  Next is \\"What Up Gangsta\\".  Ok, now this is a strong track.  I figured there might be better ones after right?  Wrong.<br />Next is \\"Patiently Waiting\\".  Yuck.  The beat is horrible, it sounds like something i could make by tapping on walls.  50 can't rhyme as usual.  Eminem is ok on it.  Many Men.  Many, many, many, many, many, many men.  How many many many times is he going to say many?  I guess that was his idea of comic relief because you would need it because of bad things to come later.  Next is the greatest song EVER, \\"In the club\\".  Mainly because it is so original and i've never heard about being in the club.  Seriously, I heard that song and it got me thinking,  What is this \\"club\\" that you speak of?  It is so original and therefore I cannot relate.  Just worthless.  Next is \\"High all the time\\".  Nobody cares about you being high all the time with your horrible lyrics.  Another cliche.  Next comes \\"If I can't, Bloodhound and Back Down. ZZzzzZZZzzzZZZ.  Bloodhound was listenable at best, but nothing special.  \\"Back down\\" is a diss to ja rule.  Gee, now why would 50 go after ja rule?  Could it be that he is the only rapper that is worse than him? (in his mind)  Besides Ja murdered you on his song \\"The Wrap\\".  50 can't diss anyone.  Just go back to the hole you came from.  Ok P.I.M.P. is nice.  Nice laid back Jamaican style beat.  But the horrible lyrics ruin it.  \\"Like My style\\" and \\"Poor Lil Rich\\" are also listenable AT BEST.  But still not even worth a discussion.  21 Questions.  Just horrible.  I hear elementary school kids singing \\"I love you like a fat kid love cake\\".  Yeah it's a clever line if you are catering to 12 year olds.  The beat is HORRIBLE.  The worst I ever heard.

1586212567|4.0|This book is primarily a motiviational tool, at which I think it does a great job.  It gives you some broad ideas of how to go about Retiring Young and Retiring Rich, which you will then need to research further once you select your avenues.  The main thing here is that it is easy to read, makes a lot of sense and really makes you feel like you CAN achieve your goals if you are really willing to put forth the effort.  I think he does a great job of explaining the difference between &quot;thinking&quot; about retiring early and actually putting a plan in place to DO IT. I find that re-reading sections of this book get me going again on moving ahead -- it's like a kick in the pants to take charge of my own financial future.  A great starting point for those who are even considering an early retirement.

B000006TRV|5.0|When this album was released, the disagreements in creativity between Floyd's members seemed to be at it's highest. Bassist Roger Waters seemed to exert more control over the creativity, and as a result, shut out many ideas from the other members.<br />THE WALL (1979) is a concept album based on a character named Pink, whose turbulent circumstances are loosely based around events in the lives of former Floyd frontman Syd Barret (e.g. \\"Nobody Home,\\" etc.) and Roger Waters. Roger himself was particularly the one most affected by Syd Barrett's mental decline, and it's effects can be heard throughout the album.<br />There are some rather conflicting thoughts regarding this album, especially from guitarist/vocalist David Gilmour. He has stated that creating THE WALL was a painful experience, as well as stating that he thought overall, the album came out good, but it lacked the soul of earlier efforts. While this indeed is a brilliant album, I can't help but feel just as ambivalent as he does about the album.<br />First, off, it's been stated many times that this is largely a Roger Waters work, and the unison of the band cannot be seen on this work. There are no lovely, ethereal, reflective Rick Wright keyboard tracks (or his vocals for that matter), none of the Mason/Wright/Gilmour contributions - in short, not much collectivity in general. Gilmour wrote roughly two or three tracks on the album, but otherwise, it's mostly the product of Waters, and as a result, it's difficult to see this as a Floyd album - in a collective sense of the word. This may be the main reason why I considered this album strong lyrically, but spotty, inconsistent and dry on a musical level for many years. I realize that anytime a concept album is present, the lyrics are usually the focal point, and basing a strong opinion on the music shouldn't mean much. But, unfortunately, I have to enjoy both aspects of a concept album strongly, for me to consider it an all-around classic.<br />Over the years, my opinions have changed, and I enjoy the album much more than I did in the past. Of course, comparisons between this album and Floyd's earlier albums should probably be avoided, but are nearly inevitable, since Floyd has such a strongly dedicated following, and has had so for many years. Perhaps, if there had been no A SAUCERFUL OF SECRETS (1968), no MEDDLE (1971), no DARK SIDE OF THE MOON (1973) or no WISH YOU WERE HERE (1975), this album wouldn't draw so much controversy (in both a positive and negative sense). On a positive, each of these albums didn't have the grandiosity in theme, soundscape, and didn't have the compelling theme of alienation that many of us humans can relate to (with the exception of DSOTM.) This, along with most of the fairly accessible tracks (I consider this album possibly the most mainstream-friendly of these) may have been the two main contributing factors of this album's overwhelming success. However, in the negative sense, it would seem like a drying-up in creativity. When listening to Floyd's albums in chronological order, and this album being their culmination in creativity (excluding THE FINAL CUT), it's hard not to see Floyd slipping quite a bit, which is what I've basically witnessed in Floyd ever since DSOTM came along (even though I enjoy each of the albums Floyd made between DSOTM and this album.) However, as stated above, if none of those earlier Floyd albums were to exist, this album would probably come the closest it can to being unanimous in it's classic status (not that it already hasn't.)<br />From the grandiose, megalomaniacal David Bowie-meets-Queen-meets film score hard rock/metal strains of the opening \\"In The Flesh?\\" to the maniacal, orchestrated \\"The Trial,\\" this album is a journey through alienation, depression, frustration, anger and many other dark areas of the human psyche. It's disturbing, poignant and rewarding all at once. Enjoy.<br />Also recommended: THE WALL (the film) and BEHIND THE WALL (a Floyd documentary.)ntary.)
B0000BYM3K|4.0|I love this band. Iron Maiden is a heavy band with incredible lyrics ans stunning vocals sung by Bruce Dickenson.  Their new cd, Dance of Death, which I bought the day it came out, is an alright sounding album.  It has its good points and bad points.  I was expecting a more bold album from them but this album sounds just like their previous release, Brave New World.  Being a great Maiden fan as I am, still enjoy this metal peice because I also loved Brave New World.  The lyrics are still about death, desolation and destruction which is a good thing.  The beats however, have been done before on their last album.  The guitar solo's sound like older Maiden, such as Alexander the Great.  They calm things down with the last track, &quot;Journeyman&quot;, which is something Maiden normally don't do.  Despite these little complaints, the ultimate heavy metal band has done it again with its shocking artwork and great music.  This album is already topping the charts along with Metallica's &quot;St. Anger&quot;.  I suggest any heavy metal fan who enjoys any Maiden or other heavy music, to buy this album.  It has what a metal cd should have but Maiden still never took the new step ahead.
B00004ZD69|5.0|How does one describe music so vast, emotional and enigmatic without sounding silly? It's almost impossible, which is why I'd recommend readers to look elsewhere on this page for comprehensive, well-articulated, eloquent descriptions, as you probably won't find them in this particular review. I cannot  offer anything more than subjective explorations, as I've owned this thing for months, and I still struggle trying to form coherent statements about it.<br />Having said that, Godspeed You! Black Emperor - a nine piece band from Canada - has created some of the most evocative, atmospheric, reflective and beautiful music. LIFT YOUR SKINNY FISTS LIKE ANTENNAS TO HEAVEN! (2000) is an instrumental album (excluding some of the random voice samples heard in a few of the tracks) comprised of four 20-minute tracks which play out in near-classical style. The band integrates strings (violin, cello, etc.) into their \\"rock\\" music, which also adds to the orchestral element of it all. Many of the arrangements also seem to play out in ascending mode: one ascending pattern plays, while another will ascend beneath, and behind it, like in circular motion. If I were to try and label this music, I'd call it a mix of ambient, anthem, orchestral, and psychedelic rock. Like many have stated, the pattern of soft, slow, build, explode, calm seems to play that way through each of the tracks, although, I don't think it's repelling enough to outweigh the impact one will receive after hearing, or rather experiencing, this music.<br />\\"Storm\\" is my favorite track on the album. Everyone will have their own responses as to what the tracks represent. As for me, this particular track reminds me of a song of the earth, or the song/anthem of life. It reminds me of a forest on a mid-autumn day with a tint of sunlight beaming through the shade: earthy, melancholic, reflective, balanced, ambivalent - the kind of disposition humans would have after experiencing the most elated of joys, and the deepest of sadness - more specifically, the kind of balanced, bittersweet, slightly melancholic disposition one would have after being well-seasoned in the experiences of life. If the leaves, trees, and all of Earth's components (including the grass - mother nature's carpet) could sing, this is probably what you would hear -- a song representing life itself - the happiness and the sadness. In the center of the two moods, there is sort of a melancholic, bittersweet disposition, which is exactly what seems to be the mood of this track (for me.) Other than all of that, the track exudes an anthemic quality, as well as elegance, and also has a retro-feel to it, the kind of thing you swore you've heard in the late 60s or early 70s.<br />\\"Static\\" loses the balanced, melancholic, wisened/mature disposition, and moves into more darker, sinister, imbalanced areas. Anger, jealousy, rage and other turbulent emotions seem to come to mind when I hear this. I also think of the color red, particularly the darker kind, like a blood-red. Someone told me that this track should have been named \\"storm,\\" as it's much stormier than the first track. He makes a great point, as this fiery, red-hot track gets loud, noisy, and dangerously aggressive, especially near the ending climactic point with it's distortion/feedback, screeching note-bends and other guitar dynamics which almost make for masochistic listening.<br />This music is beautiful, transcendent, evocative and nearly indescribable. Don't expect to be able to articulate your responses to it very easily: just look at the silly comments listed above in this review. Nevertheless, if you're looking for simple, straightforward pop (or metal) music, you'd be well-advised to ignore this album. If it's deep, atmospheric, droning, meditative music you're looking for, give this a shot.dness - more specifically, the kind of balanced, bittersweet, slightly melancholic disposition one would have after being well-seasoned in the experiences of life.

His group has based its findings on significant research of companies based on outperformance of the stock market over 15 years and includes comparisons of other companies in the same industries and similar starting financial positions as the &quot;greats&quot; that did not outperform.  <br />The only caveat I have is that correlation does not imply causality.  He finds numerous corrleations between various factors and a company's greatness.  These may indeed be the factors which may make a company great, or both greatness and these factors may be the results of some other factor.  Additional research is needed to discover if the factors mentioned are indeed the causation of &quot;greatness&quot;.

B0000BYM3K|5.0|In my short, sporadic review, I simply wrote that &quot;this is Iron Maiden so it's flawless.&quot; and in many ways, I still stand by that piece of rhetoric. I have been an avid fan of Iron Maiden since I first lent my ears to &quot;Somewhere In Time&quot; around 1987. Iron Maiden possessed an unnatural skill of being able to drill specifics into your brain that most bands let dwell in the background. The lyrics are always poignant and very descriptive, the rhythms are constantly shape-shifting and the solos encircle the songs in a way that each solo is distinguishable and memorable. Tightly knit drumming from Nicko McBrain ties it all together and puts the cap on music that is in constant motion without pause. Even at its most mellow, Iron Maiden's music ebbs and flows until it picks up speed but no matter what the tempo, Iron Maiden's music is constantly moving and there is always a lot more going on. Very few bands have that trait and even fewer know how to use it properly.<br />So, how is &quot;Dance Of Death&quot; different? In short, it's not. That is precisely why Iron Maiden is loved so fervently by those who follow them. They fail to be disappointing. And in 2003, Iron Maiden has crafted yet another metal masterpiece that while not very different than 2000's &quot;Brave New World&quot;, stands tall amongst a sea of bands that do anything but move. And, while it may seem that they take babysteps in the musical evolution sense (at least according to critics), they needn't leap very far when they had it down to a science from the start.<br />As for the songs, nothing is done very unusal. &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot;, despite whining from various critics, is a great lead-off single. While it fails to pack the punch of an &quot;Aces High&quot; or &quot;Moonchild&quot;, it is an upbeat song that starts things off nicely and has a excellent singalong chorus that sticks in your head long after you turn the CD off. &quot;Rainmaker&quot; has one of Maiden's finest lead off melodies ever and sticks out as another standot track. &quot;No More Lies&quot; bears alot of the same epic properties of &quot;Brave New World&quot; and it is followed by &quot;Montsegur&quot; and the title track which musically reminds of classic tracks from &quot;Number Of The Beast&quot; and &quot;Piece Of Mind&quot;, complete with string arrangements. &quot;Gates Of Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;New Frontier&quot; quickly take over as the finest showings on this album. Great builds, excellent leads and choruses that leap out at you and are quickly memorized are traits that these two tracks have in droves.<br />It seems like most people are claiming &quot;Paschendale&quot; as their new favorite and those with a penchant for a Maiden epic will not be let down. &quot;Face In The Sand&quot; comes close to the greatness of &quot;Gates&quot; and &quot;Frontier&quot; and &quot;Age Of Innocence&quot; stands well as a Maiden song that will stand tall, despite not having quite the memorable aspects of other songs. &quot;Journeyman&quot; is quickly becoming my favorite Maiden closer since &quot;Only The Good Die Young&quot; and though it's sad to close the album at all, it's not much of a chore to hit the play button and listen to the album once more.<br />Naysayers will always be there but any true fan will not be slightly let down as there is nothing to be let down by here. It's Iron Maiden - not Metallica, not Zeppelin, not any band that has put forth a questionable effort in the past or present. It all comes down to when a formula has been prefected, you leave it alone. There has not ever; nor will there ever be the scare of rapping, turntables, lack of guitar solos, baggy pants or any trivialities that others in the genre have been guilty of experimenting with. This is classic Iron Maiden 20 plus years after their debut and I have no doubt that those that know of their absolute genius will hold this album high with praise and admiration.

B00006RU5B|4.0|Anyone notice the spiritual growth/wrestling themes that Vedder, Corgan, and Cornell have been wordplaying with in their newest releases? strange coincidences abound by the vestiges of post-grunge songwriters who have remained true to their callings and are now  gliding gracefully into the early 21st c. Rock music landscape. Their spiritual wailing point to some interesting growth wherin revolt and rage seem to be maturing into some sort of desire for surrender and acceptance (or are they simply cries for mercy? :)  Either way- they are all worthy reflections of an inner anxiety that most of our generation seem to be struggling to sculpt anew. With many of us eschewing organized religion and its many faces of hypocrisy and intolerance, it is healthy to hear our artists voicing inner struggles that we too often keep to ourselves for fear of coming off as the zealots and new-age freaks we are so terrified of. I for one am happy for the chance to identify with my peers and not feel so alone with my own searching with these very same questions- peace  PS- check out the novel &quot;Life of Pi&quot; by Yann Martel for more evidence of this phenomenon.
B000094DUP|5.0|This is one of my best album. My fav tracks are : Not Me, Not I,Butterfly and Throw it Away.<BR>Delta is one of the new aspiring Australian Artists and she has wonderful voice. I am not big fan of aust music however I Have to say that this is one of the best albums i have listened to.<BR>Worth buying and its 100% satisfaction.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|The first time I listened to this I didn't really like.  By the third time I realized its better than Brave New World.  Now on the 8th or 9th listen i'm starting to wonder if this isn't the best Maiden album ever!  I just love this stuff that grows on you the more you listen to it... haven't heard anything like this in a LONG time.  Wildest Dreams is the weakest song and I haven't really gotten into Rainmaker yet but the rest is so awesome!  My favorite is Face In the Sand but I don't know if that'll last, paschendale, journeyman, montsegur, dance of death... man they all rule!!!
B0000BYM3K|3.0|The optimistic review: Maiden is back reviving the true spirit of metal, in a music scene were American metal bands like Metallica have degraded into MTV-style-metal bands. I liked \\"wildest dreams\\", as it captures some essensce of the 80's maiden. I really liked \\"rain maker\\" and \\"face in the sand\\", truely iron maiden songs. The build up of \\"Dance of the Death\\" is also interesting. Bruce is amazing<BR>and still kicks [butt] big time. I think this is a better<BR>album compared to the \\"brave new world\\".<br />The pessimistic review: repeated patterns from \\"brave new world\\" can be heard here. Solos are not spectacular and you can hear the same licks that they have been using all along. I think the last<BR>album they put a lot of effort into solos was the \\"fear of the dark\\". None of the solos really stroke me. They have 3 guitar<BR>players but it is not clear if the 3rd guitar adds a lot to the<BR>whole music. I mean you would expect to hear 3 guitars harmonizing with each other, similar to the wonderful harmonization of Murray and Smith in the 80s, but I cannnot hear that.<br />Overall: IronMaiden rules no matter what. I strongly recommend the CD. Up the Irons !
B000002JR8|5.0|Because: PANTERA ARE THE K-I-N-G-S OF HEAVY METAL! Forget KoRn and Limp Bizkit, Pantera's where it's at. Metallica started in 1983 but then Pantera released a record on that same year, so Pantera have been around for awhile. With Far Beyond Driven, they prove that they can go heavier than Cowboys. Cowboys was great, Trendkill was really heavy and this is excellent, but still, Vulgar is best. Now, if I had to pick a favourite, it would be Good Friends &amp; A Bottle Of Pills, followed by Becoming and Strength Beyond Strength. The stumbling blocks for me are, 25 Years, Shedding Skin and Planet Caravan. Also, listen to the live CD, and if you go through the entire of Becoming on there and they'll do the Outro to Throes Of Rejection at the end of Becoming, heading into 5 Minutes Alone, and again in I'm Broken when they do the end of By Demons Be Driven(on Vulgar). Here's the favourites.<br />Good Friends &amp; A Bottle Of Pills(10 Stars)<BR>Becoming(10 Stars)<BR>Strength Beyond Strength(10 Stars)<BR>I'm Broken(9 Stars)<BR>Slaughtered(8 Stars)<BR>5 Minutes Alone(8 Stars)<BR>Use My Third Arm(7 Stars)<BR>Throes Of Rejection(7 Stars)<BR>Hard Lines, Sunken Cheeks(7 Stars)<BR>Shedding Skin(6 Stars)<BR>25 Years(5 Stars)<BR>Planet Caravan(4 Stars)<br />1)Strength Beyond Strength: Every Pantera album starts HEAVY! This is NEW Pantera right here people. You wait for Trendkill people, you'll be banging into a coffee table, mark my words, MARK MY WORDS! Every Pantera album starts with a very heavy guitar (except Cowboys and Trendkill whick Cowboys starts with a semi-soft guitar and Trendkill with an ear-splitting scream and guitar, bass and drums). I did enjoy the live version(Official Live: 101 Proof), and I was blown away by it. This is my 3rd favourite. 10/10.<br />2)Becoming: Now, this is my 2nd fav on this CD. Starts out really thrash, with the opening drums. Then as the song goes on it gets better. This is one of the songs that wouldn't have landed Far Beyond Driven on the no.1 album at it's debut date if it wasn't in. It's very good, but I like the live version better. 10/10<br />3)5 Minutes Alone: This is the &quot;Walk&quot; of Far Beyond Driven. It's pretty good. I'd say that although there are 5 better songs, it's still an AMAZING song. Well, I've got nothing else much to say about this song. But, it's good. 8/10<br />4)I'm Broken: I love this song. It starts with an interesting guitar, and the lyrics are outta sight. They performed this song live, and then they ended I'm Broken with the end of By Demons Be Driven, but that's the live version. The studio version's pretty good. I think that this song would've been better if they did the ending they did in the live version. Oh well, still one of the best on the album. 9/10<br />5)Good Friends &amp; A Bottle Of Pills: My favourite song. Although most people think it's an awful song, I respect that, but I don't think so. Lyrics about Phil's girlfriend and stuff. The chorus is so cool, Phil screaming like a madman and also laughing over it. I just love it. Although it's the shortest, it's the best. 10/10<br />6)Hard Lines, Sunken Cheeks: Now, this is a song that changes it's tempo very drastically, and it drags on for 7 minutes. Now, Cemetery Gates I don't mind being 7 minutes, but I hardly know this song. It would've been better if it was below 25 Years in length. Well, it gets redeemed thanks to Dimebag with another ripping guitar solo. Not bad. 7/10<br />7)Slaughtered: Very good opening bass line from Rex and then Vinnie Paul and Dimebag jump into it. A personal favourite of mine. It even outshines 5 Minutes Alone. The entire song is hevy, not one second has even a semi-soft sound. 9/10<br />8)25 Years: One of the 3 stumbling blocks. I mean, it drags for 6 minutes, and I really don't like the beginning. Basically, the song only gets good when it gets to 4:40 all the way to the end. Still, it's not the worst. 5/10<br />9)Shedding Skin: Another of the bad ones. Although it's not that bad, it still isn't that good either. Hard to say that it's the worst song, so I won't say it. But there are some highlights of the song. 6/10<br />10)Use My Third Arm: Without a doubt, the heaviest song. I mean, this has the most insane intro in Far Beyond Driven(Well, except for Strength Beyond Strength and Becoming)and it's just non-stop metal from there. Right in your face. 7/10<br />11)Throes Of Rejection: This isn't bad at all. It's pretty good actually. The whole song is great. And at the end comes a repetitive guitar tune that just happened to be played at the end of Becoming on the live CD. I'm not displeased, it's worth a listen. 7/10<br />12)Planet Caravan: Now, this is the worst song on the album. A few reasons. 1. They didn't give us the lyrics, 2. It's too WEAK, and 3. If they were gonna do a Black Sabbath cover, I wish they could've done Paranoid itself, or Iron Man, or even War Pigs. Oh well, at least we actually got a Black Sabbath cover song. It's better than the Black Sabbath version. 4/10<br />Well. That's FBD for you. Wait 'till Trendkill, you won't regret it. Get that, Cowboys, and Vulger too. Try to get the live CD as well.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|Being an Iron Maiden fan since the first album back in 1980, I find this to be their strongest effort since the amazing Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son. The songs are more varied than any Maiden album, even an all acoustic track. Some of the songs have subtle orchastral arangements that add a bit of drama. The highlights of the album are &quot;Rainmaker&quot;, &quot;Dance Of Death&quot; and &quot;Face In The Sand&quot;, but the real show-stopper is &quot;Paschendale&quot;. This will be remembered as a Maiden classic. The only reason this did not get a 5 star rating is the Kevin Shirley production. The sound is very mono-tone, sort of a lower mid-range. No crisp highs from the cymbols or guitars. and no thumping bass. The mix is no better. Vocals are too far in the background, as are the drums. These songs deserve much better. Overall, D.O.D. is a &quot;must have&quot; for any Metal fan, and hopefully the 5.1 surround version coming later in the year will improve the sound quality.
B000002BYD|2.0|I can't fault PJ for staying true to themselves and making music that (I would hope) is very satisfying to them.  But I also can't fault a good share of the fans who picked up \\"Ten\\" and \\"Vs.\\", who also stay true to their tastes in good catchy, hook-driven \\"comfort food\\" rock n' roll and not wild experimentation and extreme tangents away from what originally got them where they are.  <br />What I'm saying is, if you're like me, and you found \\"Ten\\" and \\"Vs.\\" to be two of the best albums of the 90's, but you found \\"Vitalogy\\" to be decent but a little too avant garde in its direction, steer clear of this and all post-\\"Vitalogy\\" Pearl Jam albums.  They're just not the same band anymore.  And even if they occasionally show signs of the PJ of old (as they do on excellent songs like \\"Wishlist\\" and \\"In Hiding\\"), it's too little too late.  <br />Plus, you know you're album's going to bomb when the first single (\\"Given To Fly\\") is instantly recognizable as a hack retread of a Led Zeppelin tune (\\"Going To California\\").
B0000AOV85|4.0|Let me add a comment to the earlier reviews. For those audiophiles like me who used this album to judge each new upgrade or modifications to our stereo systems, you will love the sound quality on your now mature audio system.<br />You get to hear a few very brief individual tracks from the original mix, or a brand new intro from a single instrument by the original artist --- then most of the full song. Make no mistake; no song is played in full. Most are introduced, as this is a documentary; but it has awesome sound and insight! Hearing a short single track really is revealing and brings back fine memories of improving our gear and enjoying a great album.<br />This has always been a special album to me. I have it in every format and I like the sound and convenience of this DVD-Audio. Too bad it is NOT the original album. If they issued DSOTM on DVD-Audio, I would buy it also.<br />I rate this 4 stars. It would be 5 if it was the original album uninterrupted.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|Maiden plays it pretty safe on this one, turning in another CD's worth of twisting, turning, galloping, precision-tuned melodic metal that sounds like it could've been recorded at the same time as 2000's \\"Brave New World\\".  This is thanks in part to repeat-producer Kevin Shirley's typical treble-heavy production (how `bout a fresh set of ears next time out, guys?).  Every song has a been-there-done-that feel to it, adding nothing to their legacy, nor taking anything from it.  <br />Maybe it'll grow on me, but as it stands after a couple spins, \\"Dance of Death\\" is an album that I feel is as uinspired as it's title.   But then I really like Metallica's \\"St. Anger\\" because it dared to be so different, which a lot of fans hated about it.  Of course, there have been far more experiments-gone-horribly-wrong in the past ten years (Motley Crue's \\"Generation Swine\\" anyone?) than there have been sucessful forays into new ground, so I supposed I'm more or less happy that Maiden stayed the course.  This way, no one gets hurt.  <br />Lead singer Bruce Dickinson promised a few weeks ago that the new Iron Maiden album would \\"not[be bad]\\".  Well, it doesn't, but it doesn't exactly turn anyone's world around, either.
0316666343|4.0|This book is about family. At the end of the book there's a reference to the title that I still think about. I won't give it away but, for those who have read it, you'll understand. I am giving this book 4 stars because of the whole &quot;heaven&quot; idea being a little weak. It's a page turner and a very descriptive novel which I think if you like fiction, you'll enjoy it.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|This is a perfect film.  However, to review it and add nothing. . .adds nothing.  So, let me say that amidst all of the rightfully glowing praise this movie has received, let me add this: this film is the greatest depiction of mother-son love ever displayed in cinema.  The bond between young William and his &quot;wise&quot; sage of a mother is the true heart and soul of this story.  It is interesting that Cameron Crowe is such a fan of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird.&quot;  That film is the best father-son (and daughter) film ever.   Both stories spring (ultimately) from the realization that a parent has to let their child experience life--as painful and exacting as that realization is to the parent.  Both stories demonstrate the deep admiration we all have (or should have) to parents standing up to the conventions of the times (racism or consumerism).  William is &quot;allowed&quot; to enter into his journey by a mother forever providing advice (&quot;Don't use drugs!&quot;) and &quot;meaning well.&quot;   The ensuing phone calls from the road and scenes with the glorious Frances McDormand are priceless.  The scene where McDormand sees her son after his &quot;trip&quot; is Oscar worthy--look at her love and relief that he's. . . HOME.  Further, her dressing down of Billy Crudup's character is one of the funniest scenes in any film (&quot;ye-yes, ma'am.&quot;) <br />There are so many wonderful scenes in this film and the acting is superb. The ensemble is as good as any I've seen.   Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the lonely, uncool mentor is perfect.  Jason Lee as the egomaniacal (but ultimately vapid) lead singer is pulled off with aplomb.  Billy Crudup as the &quot;soul&quot; of rock and roll is the best.  This guy will win an Oscar someday though &quot;his looks are becoming a problem!&quot; <br />But ultimately, it comes back again and again to me as this:  watch this film and bear witness to the most difficult thing any of us have to do in our lives as a matter of course--watch our children grow up and become independent of us, their parents.<BR>Almost Famous is beautiful, loving ode to motherhood (parenthood).  Kudos to Cameron Crowe and his mother Alice.
B00009V7P8|5.0|Amazing.  This is one of the most original modern folk works to come out in recent years. It's about love and loss, and dealing with painful memories of family and youth. The lyrics are amazing. The music is acoustic folk, strongly rooted in the Celtic tradition, but at the same time it manages to be fresh. It grabs you and can send tingles up your spine or put a tear in your eye.  The mix contains some orchestrations and female accompanying vocals. The mix can be a bit uneven and overdone at times but that is the exception, not the rule.  Over all a very well done album. My favorite songs are the heart-wrenching \\"Older Chests\\" and the cold calculating \\"Cheers Darlin' \\" If you like Van Morrison, David Gray, or other modern Celtic-based folk singers, You'll probably be very pleased with &quot;O&quot;.
B000002KBU|3.0|I was looking through the reviews for this album and among all the gushing praise I was glad to see that a few other people see it for the over-rated bore that it is.I own a lot of Joni Mitchells albums and the one I hardly ever play is 'Blue'.I wasn't impressed when I bought it and 10 years on it hasn't improved.All her other albums I would give between 4 and 5 stars and 'The hissing of summer lawns' is a work of art.Mystified by all the praise heaped on Blue I've tried listening to it over the years to see if I was missing something but always after 3 tracks my attention starts to drift and boredom sets in.OK-it's well played and her voice is(as usual)outstanding but most of the songs are not memorable.'Carey' and 'California' have some corny lyrics and jar with the downbeat mood of most of the album.Things improve considerably with 'This flight tonight' and 'River'.'A case of you' is ok -though not the masterpece some would have you believe- but by now it's too late-the album's nearly over and ends with the dreary and whining 'The last time I saw Richard'.Blue is about 37 minutes long but feels like an hour and always leaves me feeling totally indiferent towards it as a whole.Sorry but this isn't the album such a great artist should be remembered for.
B00008D1NF|4.0|I read too many  reviews before  buying this record. I decided to  do it  because of the  reciews  of  the  downbeat magazine (which is  jazz) and  Rolling Stone (which is rock). Both  give  it   5  and  4  stars. This is  true. You  have  beatle's harmonies mixed  with  brazilian  music. This is new material  and  give us  a  view  about  the  recent  music  of Brazil. In  addition.  The  booklet  includes  lyrics  and  chords  of all  songs  which  is a nice  detail  to understand  the project.  This is  not  a perfect  album, but  it worths the purchase. Good  effort Tribalistas!
B00009V7P8|5.0|Brilliant lyrics and a melodies that find a place in your soul.  One feels that they have been let in on a precious secret when they discover this album by Damien Rice.  Perfect for those melancholoy moments when you're in need of empathy.  A must have for anyone looking for a good &quot;singer/songwriter&quot; album that is both earthy and inventive.
B00005JKN9|4.0|I recently purchased the &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; DVD, and am very impressed with the film.  It just cements Martin Scorcese's place in history as one of the greatest American film makers of all time - Oscar or not!  The cinematography, set design, costumes and art directions made everything look &quot;vintage.&quot;  This is indeed a visually satisfying period piece.<br />As for the performances, I really can't complain.  Leo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz both turn in strong performances as do the rest of the cast, but Daniel Day-Lewis is without a doubt the jewel in this film's crown.  Honestly, he cannibalized every scene he was in as the Irish-hating &quot;native&quot; gang leader/thug Bill &quot;the Butcher&quot; Cutting.  One scene in particular that gave me chills was when &quot;The Butcher&quot; publicly brutalizes Amsterdam Vallon (DiCaprio) after the young man's initial attempt to avenge his father's death fails.  Upon the crowd's request that Bill publicly off him right then and there, he loudly declares &quot;HE AIN'T EARNED A DEATH AT MY HANDS!&quot;  Is there any role that this gifted performer CAN'T do?!<br />The film is a bit on the long side, but not so much that it takes away from the overall story.  Could it have been better?  Probably, but I would still recommend this movie.
B00005JLXE|1.0|This movie is so contrived that I cannot recommend it.  Any of the Batman movies can beat this one.  The Shadow was more interesting.  It just doesn't work as a movie.  It would be a pity to see them make a sequel to this.  It's as if someone tried to build a story around having Afleck as a superhero.  Bad script.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Johnny Cash's voice, a quavering thunderclap of naked truth and honesty, was a one of a kind instrument on loan from God. Johnny wore it out, telling it like it is, until the voice shook with a weary majesty that forced you to listen with a tinge of sadness, knowing the man couldn't be long for this world. Johnny really died of a broken heart, missing his other half. Today, the voice is back where it belongs, in the Lord's House, and Johnny and June are together again, for eternity, as great lovers should be. Amen.<br />I have loved Johnny Cash since I was a little kid. Everybody in my family loved Johnny Cash. Even my daddy, who has never been known to hum, to whistle or to sing along with any music, would admit to liking the music of Johnny Cash. In 1984, Johnny was in my home-town, McDonough, GA, where I still live, shooting a made-for-TV movie called \\"The Baron and the Kid.\\" My future wife was a reporter for the local newspaper then, and with her credentials, we managed to finagle our way onto the set, which for the McDonough scenes was an old pool hall on the square. I've been star-struck many times in my life, but nothing will ever top my first sight of Johnny Cash in the flesh. There he was, in long shirt-sleeves and loosened tie, this hulking man-mountain wih a face like forty miles of bad road, bent over a pool table, idly taking shots in rehearsal for the next scene. He looked like the biggest human being I had ever seen. He glanced up once and made infinitesimal eye contact with the crowd of gawking onlookers, including me, a skinny, moon-eyed geek with mouth agape to the point of drooling. Some amused crew people gently shooed us out, finally, but I had had my brush with greatness with The Man in Black. I will never forget it.<br />Johnny, we won't see your like again. Thank you for your music, your words and your brave example.
006097625X|2.0|I don't know what everyone is talking about, but this book was an absolutely dull nightmare of a read.  I think I would rather read something written by Todd McFarlane than to read this garbage.  I have been reading comics for over 20 years and this is one of the most hyped books I had not read, so I picked it up expecting a revelation and I could barely get through the inane drudgery that Scott McCloud puts you through.  Sorry, I don't need an explanation of panels and motion.  I think I learned that when I was 9 and read my first issue of The Avengers.  What exactly is so fascinating about this book?  Someone please tell me!
B00008IAMD|5.0|I downloaded the &quot;Hurt&quot; video today, shortly before I heard Mr. Cash had passed away. While watching the video I thought that it seemed like an incredible final triumph for such a talented artist, and was wondering if he was planning to make &quot;American IV&quot; his final release (since it would be hard to top). But that decision has now been made by a higher power. &quot;Hurt&quot; - with its career flashbacks and archived clips - will forever stand as a tribute to Johnny and his recently-departed wife, who also appears in it. The video alone is well worth the $15, and you get the incredible CD along with it.
B00003CXB4|3.0|...and confusion.<br />On first glance, The Lion King has everything.  Good animation, sweeping soundtrack, strong voice acting, and drama, drama, drama.  Its number one problem is still plot.  <br />This really isn't anything we haven't seen a million times before...both in children's and adult films.  Rewatching the special edition however I'm mostly shocked at how thin the plot really is.  <br />For some reason, I remembered more to Simba taking back pride rock, but it is over so fast after Simba has his vision that one would think Disney was terrified of its audience getting bored.  Maybe if my attention span was shorter, this would be great!  There's lot's of fire, the orchestra lays on swells of emotion and the film suddenly ends.  It's more a visual, visceral experience than a film.  I suspect if you pulled the musicals out, the film might be less than an hour.<br />Man, I sound down on this film.  It's still probably one of the best things Disney did in the 90's (though I strangely prefer Tarzan and Mulan...although I can understand all who'd differ with me on this one.)  What Lion King is is a paradox--at times it treats its themes and characters so seriously you could almost cheer or weep, then quickly sinks back into standard Disney fare...and oh, there must be fart jokes...<br />It also suffers from a bit of the Lucas syndrome.  What's that?  Remember back when you saw your first Kurosawa film and realized how much Lucas had freely borrowed?  Or perhaps when reading your favorite books on Eastern philosophy or Joseph Campbell and you'd come across something that Lucas plugged into Star Wars.  In fact, pretty soon it started becoming evident how many ideas had just been slammed together to make a new synthesis--and that can be a great thing, or sometimes it can just be weird.<br />I lean more toward weird with the Lion King.  Disney tries to elicit every emotion and play on every theme, and instead of being effective the whole business just feels rather strange to me.  Maybe I've just seen a lot of films where the son is exiled, grows, becomes mighty and returns for revenge.  In my most recent viewing I could only think of Conan (it doesn't help that James Earl Jones is in both movies.)  Stuck with all these associations (many I like more than Lion King), I can't call this more than an average film.  <br />And perhaps that statement needs some rectification.  Like everything else by Disney, the right time and the right place can make their films great.  Since I was in college when this first came out, perhaps there never was a best time.  I know Disney put their heart into this, and I think young people will continue to love it as they grow up--but I also think its sad that Disney treats this like their very best film.  Bambi still hasn't been reissued while Dumbo got a rather shoddy release.  I guess it doesn't matter since Disney has now apparently discarded 2D animation altogether, but I've always hoped for the best from Disney as I know they're capable of it.
B000069AUI|5.0|I feel previliged to be able to hear this album. Listening to this album is a soul-purging experience. The scientist is the best song I have heard in my whole life. The morosness of the song was accentuated by Chris eerie voice, which haunts u for long time. It is addictive to listen this song. If u have lost some one u love, u definitly will attach to this song.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|i bought gavin's cd on a whim after hearing good things about him, and allow me to tell you i was not disappointed. this is a guy who knows where hes going and is on his way to getting there fast if he keeps putting out discs such as this one. track after track i was mesmerized by his incedible lyrics, amazing piano driven melodies, and great voice. let me assure you, if you purchase this cd, you will not be let down. standout songs such as &quot;i dont wanna be&quot;, &quot;belief&quot;, and the title track &quot;chariot&quot;, will pull you in and you will not be able to free yourself from the wonders of this artist.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Jezzzzz!!!! Why are people dogging this??? This makes &quot;Brave New World&quot; look like sheet music for Chopsticks!!!! Don't get me wrong by saying that, I love &quot;Brave New World!&quot; But this album is far better and reaches so many new musical and lyrical horizons of Maiden. Cheesy lyrics you say? Just name one, come on gripers, name one, I didn't see you name any!!! The lyrics are spectacular and so is the musicianship. This dethrones &quot;Powerslave&quot; as the their most phenomenal piece of work yet!!! Best Iron Maiden album ever!!! I am so blown away and impressed by &quot;Dance Of Death.&quot; It will remain in my CD changer until next summer!!! I love it!!! Come on Maiden fans, buy it!!! Up The Irons!!!!!!!!!!
B00009MECF|3.0|Don't take my middle of the road three star rating as a sign of apathy.  This movie is one you will either love or hate, and in my case I very much enjoyed certain things and very strongly disliked others.<br />Obivously the big draw in this movie is Leonardo DiCaprio.  I have to say, he does an outstanding job with this role.  In the true story of drugged-out high schooler Jim Carroll, he thrives on the type of script Academy Awards are made out of: tons of opportunities for him to be high, low, enraged, in sorrow.  There are a lot of opportunities to use his physicality in the role, and he seizes every one.  In particular I think of his drug withdrawal sequence and he and his friends' mourning the death of a close friend by getting drunk and playing basketball in the rain.<br />The plot has a sixteen year old Jim Carroll playing high school basketball.  Three of his teammates are his best friends, and when not on the basketball court, they tend to find all kinds of \\"innocent\\" trouble around New York (knocking over food vendor carts, for instance).  Another outlet of energy for Jim alone is his diary where he records sensations he feels in his young life.<br />His search for sensation and his friends' desire to find trouble coalesces in experiments with drugs like cocaine and herione.  As Jim notes in the monologue of the movie, there is no such thing as a part-time addict.  They fall further and further into the downward spiral in an effort to evade pressures from school teachers, coaches, and parents.<br />Some of the scenes in this movie are very gripping and visceral.  However, the links between these scenes tend to be bogged down in poor directing.  I realize this movie was a lower budgeted one, but there really is no excuse for having a movie made in 1995 that looks like it was made in 1985.  While the performance by DiCaprio is extraordinary, the directing is lackluster.  Poor camera angles, helpless lighting, bit part actors who look and sound amateur; those should all be blamed on the director.<br />However, this movie is worthwhile if you are one who has a particular interest in either Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Wahlberg (he stars as a main character and one of Jim Carroll's best friends), or the subject matter.  I have to say I thought \\"Trainspotting\\" handled the subject of drug use extremely well, but this movie is right up there in the ability to depict the sensations felt by those addicted.
B00004W52U|5.0|This band changed the way I will forever look at music.  They changed my life.  If you were there to witness them, you are a very lucky person.<br />As one Lookout Records person put it:<br />\\"Operation Ivy came and went with the fleeting incandescence of a comet that will remain emblazoned forever on the consciousness of anyone who ever had the privilege of witnessing them in their glory. They stand, and undoubtedly always will, among the handful of bands that truly matter.\\"
B0000584V3|5.0|Opeth what can I say.  Blackwater Park is a standout in the world of heavy music.  Not for the squeemish not for the radio or MTV, not enough &quot;bling-bling&quot; and way to much substance to make it on that channel.  If you are looking for well written, well played and well produced album this is it.  Many albums have one or two of em, Opeth has them all on this platter.  They cut into many different sounds on Blackwater park. Deth Metal insanity reminiscent of, Death, Morbid Angel, on &quot;Leper Affinity&quot;.  Aqualung allusions on &quot;Drapery Falls&quot;, you could even get &quot;dusty in that wind&quot;.  Dream Theater riffs on Funeral Portrait. Very Nice &quot;Planet Caravan&quot; guitar work on &quot;Bleak&quot;.  Take all that and book end it with great playing and vocals that run from Cookie Monster to James H. on the &quot;Black&quot; album and you have a metal masterpiece.  Weight, execution and production on par with the Panteras and Deftones of the world, while being totally original they are their own. Enough variety to keep all listeners entertained and the Bloody Fist of metal that all Motorheads need to face another day at the office. This album has it all. <br />For the readers reference her is what has been on my stereo as of late.  <br />Morbid Angle - Gateways to Annihilation<BR>Entombed - Morning Star<BR>King Diamond - I got all his Albums<BR>Slayer - Yeah all of these too<BR>Evanescence - that new one<BR>Garbage - Version 2.0<BR>Black Label Society - Zakk rules<BR>Curve - Lords of Acid - Elvis - Sinatra - Bill Withers
B00008EY7H|5.0|Alegria is finally coming out on dvd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />You can tell I am really excited because Alegria (along with Quidam and Dralion) is the best cirque du soleil performance currently available on dvd.  Alegria features excellent acrobatics, an interesting storyline, and fantastic performance.
0316776963|4.0|I knew nothing of Sedaris when I picked this one up, it just<br />looked interesting.  I laughed out loud from cover to cover.<br />The New York stories nearly killed me, and the tangents his<br />imagination rides off on are scarily familiar and hilarious.<br />One of the best books I've read in a long time.  Sherman Alexie's work got me interested in the short story arena, and Sedaris showed me another side of it that was equally enticing.<br />I promptly went out and read his other works and am looking forward to more.
B00001QEE7|5.0|The Little Mermaid has to be one of the best movies of all time! Disney has alot of great movies, but this one has to be one of my favorite ones. Ariel, plays such a happy, and outgoing character, with all her adventures, and things she wants to learn. She is tired of being &quot;under the sea&quot;, and she wants to know whats really up there. The music in this movie is the best! The songs in this movie, are so magical that it wants you to sing along. I think this movie is romantic, because I cried at the end of the movie, and it touched me. I dont know why, but I always cry at the end when she says &quot;I love you daddy&quot; to her dad. Well, anyways, Flounder, and Sebastian are great characters, and the scenes under the sea are really well illustrated. SO if you dont have this movie already, please, but it now, because whenever your feeling down, or feel like singing, The Little Mermaid is the movie to watch.
078322933X|5.0|This is a chilling tale of young love turned nightmare. When Nicole meets David (the perfect) guy, he is not all that he seems to be. This is a story of true obsession. David will do anything to be with Nicole forever, no matter what it takes. This is really a must see for all you drama seekers. One of my all time favorites
0553103547|5.0|A once peaceful land ruled by one of the many houses is thrust into turmoil when King Robert Baratheon is suddenly killed in a hunting accident. What will become of the benevolent yet resourceful house Stark? Will the manipulative and rich Lannisters win the iron throne?<br />&quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; Is a captivating and beautifully written introduction to the &quot;Song of Ice and Fire&quot; book series, slated to be six books long(but could easily surpass that).<br />The book is comparable to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, in that is incredibly deep, detailed, and enthralling. Right off the bat the book captures its reader's attention using incredible imagery, a deep sense of foreboding, and a wonderfully complex setting.<br />At almost 800 pages, this sprawling epic creates an entire world. While it may get confusing at times, it does get clearer as you learn about all the characters, houses, and societies. If you still have trouble, there is also a very lengthy(and very helpful) appendix in the back of the book that explains who comes from what house and what that house is distingushed for.<br />Each chapter focuses on one character, and there are many characters. But, unlike many other books that do this, it is very hard to play favorites with the characters, as they are all so well developed and defined that you can't help but appreciate even the most sinister characters and their dirty political plots.<br />However, if you're the kind of person who doesn't like politics, long, complex stories, or high level reading, then this book probably isn't for you, as it includes all of the above mentioned elements.<br />All in all, this book is as good as, if not better, than &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. And the book series isn't even finished yet. If you like a long read that you can really get into, or a book that you can't put down, then this is definetly for you.
B000021XS0|5.0|i will not lie about myself because i dont have many progressive metal cds, infact i only have two, this one and the other being Planet X's Universe (a masterpiece within itself too) and i could easily be mistaken by saying this is the best prog metal album ever, so i wont, but i will say it is one of my top 5 favorite albums ever and is #1 on my judgment of talent! Dream Theater does a great job in accorporating emotion into the music while seemingly telling a story. To truly appreciate this album you would have to listen to it from the very begining to the very end, because like i said it tells a story, its just like what a musical would be without the visuals (unless you see them live, i want to) and with extremely talented fills and solos to back it up! im not a real expert on music and i cant really say all the good and convincing things that other reviews say cause i dont know how to express myself that way but i can say that not only is this a good album to listen to pass time (extremely good way to pass time, but you will definently not want it to end!) but its also a great cd to listen to when you feel sad and depressed, like 'Oveture 1928' and 'Strange Deja Vu' can give you a more joyful, happy, innocent feeling while still maintaining an energetic and continuing lead guitar and drum assault!!!!!!!!!!!
B000066NW0|5.0|This is the best CD I have ever got  from female artist. The first time I heart her song on the radio in New York. I was very impress about her. She had made a really good song. It hits the chart all around the world. Complicated is one of the best song that I have ever heard within 10 years. I like the meaning and the beat. The meaning was really good and I still listen to this song. Last thing I wanna say is you shoud buy this CD because you will love it.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|There are lots of pretenders in today's world of modern day blues.  Joe is the real deal.  Never heard of him until I saw him open for Peter Frampton.  He stole the show and left the crowd wondering just &quot;who was that masked man?&quot;.  Plays with unparalleled honesty, raw emotion, and talent seldom seen these days. Outstanding vocals. Tired of spending your money for CDs with only one or two decent songs accompanied by 8 average songs?  Get Joe's &quot;Blues Deluxe&quot; and you'll be grinnin' like a fat 'possum.
B000002MP2|5.0|Here's how I rated this album (by song):<br />1. &quot;Burnout&quot;- A<BR>2. &quot;Having a Blast&quot;- B+<BR>3. &quot;Chump&quot;- B+<BR>4. &quot;Longview&quot;- A+<BR>5. &quot;Welcome to Paradise&quot;- A<BR>6. &quot;Pulling Teeth&quot;- B<BR>7. &quot;Basket Case&quot;- A+<BR>8. &quot;She&quot;- A<BR>9. &quot;Sassafras Roots&quot;- B-<BR>10. &quot;When I Come Around&quot;- A-<BR>11. &quot;Coming Clean&quot;- B+<BR>12. &quot;Enemius Sleepus&quot;- B-<BR>13. &quot;In the End&quot;- B<BR>14. &quot;F.O.D.&quot;- C+<br />It's awesome!  There are no real weaknesses, and every song is great.  Highly recommended.
B000005HN6|4.0|Orchid is my least favorite Opeth album, but I'd feel like a blasphemer to give anything by this out-of-this-world band any less than four stars.  The production is a little lacking, and Akerfeldr's growls come out more like black-metal screams, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with it aside from that.  Opeth is a band that seems to get better every time, with the exception of their second album Morningrise, which I doubt they'll ever top, so it's kinda to be expected that their debut wouldn't be all that stunning.  However, I will emphasize that it is FAR better than anything you'll find on the mainstream music scene.  If you're a Linkin Park fan, you'll not understand nor appreciate why this is great music.<br />Why is it a good album?  The songs are lengthy, but they do not get boring.  Peter Lindgren is an amazing guitarist, whether he's playing an electric or acoustic guitar.  The guitars don't sound as heavy as you might expect from a death metal band, but the term &quot;death&quot; metal seems so wrong for a band as brilliant as Opeth.  Melodic death, however, is a subgenre that is totally different than traditional death, and the keyword is &quot;melodic,&quot; a term that this album defined.  Would it be wise to start your Opeth collection here?  Well, that depends.  If you do start with Orchid, you'll only appreciate later releases more.  But if you want to start with their all-time best, then go for Morningrise, Still Life, or Deliverance.  But Orchid is without doubt worthy of having in your music collection.  Like everything by these four amazing Swedes, it's got a special place in mine.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|I've never heard such an assured CD from such a young artist.  Passion frames each measure within this CD.  Fiona's greatest strength, musically, is how she fearlessly commands her own trembling bravado in such an assuredly fearful way.  Top it all off with Jon Brions lush production and you have a classic CD, filled with exquisite sadness, all the while maintaining it's self aware, settled strut.  If she's ever able to back this album up, she'll be the stuff legends are made of.
B00004UFYU|5.0|Once again, thanks to my friend who told me about the release of this new album.  It is as superb as the previous one!<br />(Omen sore) is an excellent introductory song to the new album.<br />(Divano) is haunting especially its video clip.  You should listen to the modified (Divano) in the next album (Era The Mass).<br />(Sentence) combines a female vocal singer with the Choir. Good lyrics too.<br />(Don't you) and (Madona) are very quiet and peaceful song. Useful for meditation!<br />(Infanati) shares female and male choirs, using drums beats. Very good.<br />(Hymne) and (Misere mani) are two of my favorite songs. They're good in terms of the drums used, the choir, and the female vocal singer. (Misere mani) is modified from (Mirror) of the previous album (Era), and I think it's better than (Mirror).<br />(Divore Amante) is good but it is full of sadness.<br />(In Fine) could have been better. I still don't know why there is a gap of silence in the middle of this song!<br />All in all, this album is highly recommended for tired minds, especially after work.
B00009RDG9|1.0|I posted a review of one star and the same day, some one counters with an amazing review with almost every word for praising it, amazing! Ranting it 5 stars! This movie is a sad sack of film history.. If any over 21 see's with an I.Q. above 100, please post about this.. I looked at the this posters other reviews, and low and behold I read they rated &quot;Gods and Generals&quot; with one star. Stated it was &quot;Sappy?&quot; Very interesting...A non Hooey Weird made movie gets one star..Ah, huh.. Question stands, if I mailed this movie to the studio that made could I get my money back? Do pig fly? The people who ranted this movie 5 stars I know you love this movie dearly so.. Hey, $10 dollars and you can have my copy.. Cheers...
6305327041|1.0|Usually, love 'em or hate 'em, Hollywood produces movies.  But every once in a while, a star or director hits it big enough that (s)he earns the opportunity to humiliate him/herself before an international audience in a celluloid disaster.  Or maybe some maverick executive decides that it's time to unleash Tinseltown's enfants terrible in a big-budget assault on the senses.  Shortly thereafter, those in charge realize that they made a huge mistake, and decide that maybe high-concept entertainment really only works in Europe and Asia.  While 'Four Rooms' might appeal to young Wiccans for Allison Anders' embarrassingly silly girl-power vignette (featuring-- surprise!-- a poor performance from the calculating Madonna), or make Quentin Tarantino purists happy for his cringe-inducing knock-off of an Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode, it's nothing short of a cinematic trainwreck that will be remembered primarily for ensuring that a number of talented moviemakers and actors would go through a well-deserved dry spell before working again.<br />Robert (El Mariachi) Rodriguez' vignette is the most noteworthy of the lot, which is like saying that being eaten by sharks is a hoot when compared to being eaten by zombies.  The premise of the film, with Tim Roth's hapless bellboy caught in the middle of French farce-style hijinx on acid, could have worked. But this hopeless vanity piece does nothing more than showcase the major-league pretensions of bush-league players.  The stories are inept, the pacing is leaden, the dialogue is preposterous, and the comedy is so desperately &quot;hip&quot; that the end product is embarrassing to watch.  Sadly, it all culminates in Tarantino's  shameful paean to himself at the height of his post- 'Pulp Fiction' glory.  <br />The good news?  Between this and another stellar 1995 failure, 'Destiny Turns on the Radio,' Tarantino has been effectively removed from a position in front of the camera.  And that's half the battle.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|My rating for this CD is disingenuous since I have never heard most of it.  I am just rating it about the average of what I give the rest of his work.  I am very sad today, but suddenly quite irritated having read two of the &quot;reviews&quot; below.  If all Johnny Cash ever was to you is what you described in those shallow, spiteful posts, then you missed something special and I pity you.  No one would suggest that you have to like his music or him as a person, but resorting to ad hominem attacks on a person with no regard for that person's work and how it affected people is indicative of only the smallest of minds.  And with regard to the post questioning the IQ breaking point that separates fans of Johnny Cash from others, the arbitrary number you chose is a little more than one third of my IQ and roughly between one half and one third of the average IQ of many people I know who loved this man's music.  There is an old picture of him giving the middle finger to a camera in an admittedly vulgar gesture of defiance, but perhaps that was intended for you and the number of fingers Mr. Cash is holding up is indicative of YOUR IQ.  Just something for you to think about, if you are able.

Go 50!!!!
6305263248|4.0|I'm still not quite sure why David Mamet used a pseudonym in the credits, but the movie absolutely drips with his rhythms of speech. It complements the action well, otherwise the movie would be a bore outside of the car chases. The unique element is the band of mercenaries who cannot trust each other long enough to complete their mission. The cast is great: De Niro and Jonathan Pryce are Mamet veterans. Jean Reno is quite at home playing the Jean Reno character. Natasha McElhone is painfully beautiful, and one of the most capable actresses working today. She more than holds her own with the boys. But the movie's greatest strength isn't the actors or Mamet's hypnotic chit-chat, but Frankenheimer's car chases, which are &quot;au natural&quot;. Nobody working with digital effects has generated the same level of excitement and realism, no matter what genre. The European locations are great, the cars are great, and the characters are well-rounded. Oh, and we've got a suitcase filled with who-knows-what, a la &quot;Pulp Fiction.&quot;
B000001FGG|5.0|A double album???? How audacious!!!! It was just a few years earlier that groups such as the Beatles were making an album into a thematic whole rather than a collection of hits. Now, here comes Cream, whose very name proclaims they are the best musicians (i.e., the cream) of the British music scene, recording just their third album, and they have the nerve to release it as a double!! What nerve! But, what a great album!! After 30+ years, most of this amazing music still holds up today. What's even more amazing is that many listeners at the time were awed by the &quot;symphonic tracks&quot; (i.e., those with violas and cellos), such as &quot;Passing the Time&quot; or &quot;As You Said&quot;, but these have not stood the test of time as well as the &quot;simpler&quot; blues tracks such as &quot;Politician&quot; or &quot;Born Under a Bad Sign&quot;. &quot;White Room&quot;, of course, is the ultimate marriage of the symphonic (violas and tympani) and the blues (Eric's great guitar figures). Speaking of Mr. Clapton, some people need to be reminded that Cream was a group of three equal virtuosos and not just his backing band. (According to Chris Welch in his fine book simply entitled Cream, the brass at Atlantic Records thought the same thing; that Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker were Eric's backups just like the Bluesbreakers were to John Mayall.) On the live disc, the two &quot;backups&quot; were given a chance to strut their stuff, with Bruce turning in an outstanding &quot;Traintime&quot; and Baker with his drum opus &quot;Toad&quot;. (Because of &quot;Toad&quot;, concertgoers everywhere were treated to endless, ponderous drum solos by musicians not nearly as talented as Mr Baker.) The amazing &quot;Crossroads&quot; is still a radio staple today (the song is actually a medley of two Robert Johnson songs, &quot;Crossroad Blues&quot; and &quot;Traveling Riverside Blues&quot;). &quot;Sitting on Top of the World&quot; would make Howlin Wolf proud, while &quot;Deserted Citiesof the Heart&quot; impresses with it's time and tempo changes (and, on Live Cream II, proves a surprisingly powerful live piece.) In all, a fabulous effort, influencing guitar players and seminal rock musicians for generations to come. Waste no time in letting Wheels roll into your collection at once!!!
B00009V7P8|5.0|There is no way I can even think of giving this CD less than 5 stars.  Damien Rice has crafted as close to a perfect debut CD as I've heard.  The whole package here is just brilliant.  The music - soft and sincere when in needs to be, loud and angry when it needs to be, and the lyrics - very emotional, very personal.  The performances are also excellent... from Damien's guitars and vocals, to Vyvienne Long's cellos (celli?), and Lisa Hannigan's angelic vocals.  I think the part that gets me the most is the 2nd half of &quot;I Remember&quot; where Damien's vocals are loud to the point of clipping over his acoustic guitar, while Lisa's harmony is frail and barely audible.  The places where Lisa sings solo parts are definitely among the highlights of this CD (Volcano, The Blower's Daughter, Cold Water and I Remember).  I'm not going to list my favorite songs from this CD, as there are no bad ones.  I like how the songs run together, as well... The music seems to bring to mind such artists as Jeff Buckley, David Gray, Don McLean, among others.<br />My only gripe is one that others have voiced.  Why do people place &quot;hidden&quot; tracks within the last song of the CD?  Eskimo is a great song, as are the two &quot;hidden&quot; tracks, but it would be nice to be able to select them or at least not have to wait a long period of time to get to them.  Overall that is a minor point.   This CD is just wonderful, excellent, brilliant and near-perfect.  If you have a soul, it will be touched.  If you don't, you have more serious things to worry about... lol...  This one has definitely found a place on my &quot;best of the year&quot;, possibly best of the decade list.  Let's hope he can keep up the impressive work...
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is the first Miyazaki DVD we've seen.  The purchase was for our 5-year-old, who couldn't handle some of the 'scarier' scenes.  The scenes do get pretty intense - an elegant dragon flees from a hoard of swarming origami flying creatures and gets sliced to hell from paper cuts, almost dies; (Don't die, Don't die!) but he makes it out OK.  There are other intense scenes but they're more threatening that explicit.<br />The theme of the story (Take the high road) couldn't be better.  It's a story of a girl who goes from having it a little too good, where you feel a bit for the parents, to a story where the parents overstep, help themselves to some chow intended for spirits looking for a weekend retreat, and turn into pigs.  The rest of the story is the girl rising to a series of challenging steps necessary to win back her parents.<br />Woven into this eastern story (inanimate objects have spirits too) are many Christian values such as blessed are the meek, what you do to the least of my brothers you do to me, the perils of greed, love the sinner, etc.<br />The plot has twists - you're not sure who to trust, but, again, right prevails eventually.<br />A footnote to the appropriateness for kids - the three-year-old loved it.  I recommend sitting through it with any young kid the first couple times.  Also, watch it yourself alone first if you have a concern.  My older boy wanted to quit right at the scariest part, which I thought was not good, so without knowing for sure, I decided to ride it out (I took the high road), and sure enough the scary part was over quickly and there was a happy ending.  Well worth it.
B00008EY9G|5.0|one of the best films i've seen this year...fast paced,great performances and a great ending. john cusack and amanda peet give some of the best performances i've seen this year..director james mangold keeps the movie moving with flashbacks and keeping you guessing untill the very end...if you like great whodunit's don't miss the film...one of the best of 2003...
B000000W9Z|4.0|But I had to have this album. I remember when I was 10 I heard The Heart's Filthy Lesson and I thought it was an intriguing song that I thought was pretty good. The other song I heard was the Pet Shop Boys remix of Hallo Spaceboy which was also great. I never thought of getting in it until the last 2 years. I couldn't find it anywhere and I found out that it had been deleted ( a bit of a rarity given that this is David Bowie we're talking about )!<br />I went to Holland last year and looked all over for it and almost ended up in failure. But I managed to get it by asking a guy at the shop ( well it was a CD library where people take a loan of CDs ) and he agreed to sell it for 18! Fair deal I thought. I know it may seem expensive but given the way prices go on ebay I'd stick with that.<br />At first it seemed overlong, overdrawn but had some great songs. With repeated listens though it gets better and you'll get everything from industrial rock to a bit of techno and a sample of crowds cheering and more besides.<br />As for the whole theme of the concept - you can disregard it in some respects. It's too confusing to comprehend and apparently the theme you've been told was just a bit of a cover up to how a society has led us into repressed lives and how we live in schizophrenic times. If that's just gone over your heads don't worry - it had that same effect on me. But then I have this feeling he may be having a little snipe at the media by covering up his real intentions about what the concept album was about.<br />Well anyway whatever your feelings are on about the whole concept of the album - everything seems to have a valid reasoning. The main thing about this album is the music and what I can say is that it is very good.<br />Oh and by the way those segues are hilarious &quot; It was like a fading photograph &quot;
B000096I9G|5.0|Having been a Cure fan since 1985, this is nothing short of a godsend.  I have seen the Cure live (only) 3 times.. on the kissing tour, the disintegration tour and the wish tour.  I had tickets to the swing tour, but broke my leg just before the show and therefore couldn't attend...  That said, I think what impresses me most about this DVD is how much Robert and the boys have progressed as musicians and as a band.  Robert, Simon, Perry, Roger and Jason play their collective butts off during this set.  Now let's get down to it:<br />Pornography: To echo most other reviews here, this version of Pornography blows away the original.  The energy here is much more intense.  Jason, i think, does an excellent job of recreating Lol Tolhurst's tribal drumming, and adds some nice fills and touches to update the feel a bit.  Best songs: One Hundred Years (btw, it really impressed me when during the interview Roger said that this brought him to tears the first time he played it live with the band), Siamese Twins, The Figurehead, A Strange Day (one of my all-time favs), and Cold (chilling).<br />Disintegration: One of their strongest albums played in its entirety.. what more could a Curehead ask for?  Beautiful performances here... I know some people complained about some of the keyboard sounds not being exactly the same, but give the guys a break... I didn't find it to be enough to detract from the incredible performances.  Again, Jason had his work cut out for him, filling the huge drummer-shoes of Boris Williams.  Again, he rises to the occasion nicely.  Roger's piano in Homesick is excellent. Best songs: Last Dance, Fascintation Street, Prayers for Rain, Same Deep Water as You, Disintegreation (nice to see that Robert is actually human, flubbing the words a little), Homesick.<br />Bloodflowers:  As much as I wanted to really like this CD, I couldn't get into is as much as the earlier ones.  That said, this performance does salvage it some for me.  These songs do work better in a live performance.  The energy is better and the passion is stronger.  The band also seems more comfortable with the songs.  The big surprise to me here was Perry's lead guitar in Watching Me Fall, Bloodflower and other places... while he's no Porl Thompson, he plays with a great deal of emotion.  Robert also seems to sing these songs better live than he did on the CD.  Best Songs: Watching Me Fall, The Loudest Sound, Maybe Someday, 39, Bloodflowers.<br />The encores are also awesome.  Having seen them perform both of these songs live before, I was not surprised by Robert's lead guitar abilities.  <br />Overall, Robert, Simon, Roger, Perry and Jason put in fine performances.  Minor mix issues (yeah it would be nice to hear Robert's 6 String Bass more) don't take away from it.  The camera work is very tasteful and well done, and the sound itself is very good.<br />I am also enthusiastic about what is alluded to on the DVD Jacket... the remastering and re-release of all Cure CDs in 2004.  Wow... they've deserved it for a long time now... bonus tracks would be awesome... like the live version of Faith from the Charlotte Sometimes 12 inch, the B-Sides to Head on the Door, etc... I also would love to see The Cure in Orange relased on DVD.  Also, as Robert says he has tons of tapes of live shows, how about releasing some of those as well... I think this band's live performances are greatly overlooked.  Any Cure fan will tell you.. this band (no matter which incarnation) kicks live...  If you're a Cure fan or are Curious about the Cure, you should waste no time and buy this.  Oh, but if you just like the Cure for their light poppy fluff then you may require therapy after this...
B000005H7D|4.0|This is the Coltrane record the rock crowd loves. Why? It's uncomplicated and accessible. &quot;Isn't that clever what he does with the saxophone?&quot; &quot;Blue Train&quot; is nice enough, but in the general scheme of things it pales compared to what followed. It's simply not as interesting.  And then there's Fuller.  I've heard various jazz musicians postulate that Curtis Fuller must have been the band's dealer--there is no other way he could be on this record. Generally, Fuller plays adequately but here his solos are sleep-inducing. Please don't get me wrong &quot;Blue Train&quot; is a good record and full of soul, but fans/neophytes would do better with &quot;Giant Steps.&quot;
0142004235|3.0|Without a doubt, this is good writing.  This is a wonderful book for school reading and book club discussions.  However, if you want to kick back and enjoy a fun book, I don't think this is it.  There were times when I was bored. At times when I had to put the book down, I found it hard to pick it up again.  Once I considered giving it up completely.<br />There are quite a bit of profound discussions (about life, morals, family, etc) between the characters Lee, Samuel, and Adam.  Half the time, I haven't a clue as to what they're saying (I may not be an intellect, but I'm not dumb either).  I had to re-read some of the lines or paragraphs to get a better understanding, only to find that some of the verbiage was irrelevant to the story.  It seemed such a chore having to constantly interpret what they said into simple English.  <br />Steinbeck sets up each scene by giving us some insight into history, or by describing the land and people.  For most part, I found it to be overly descriptive; some parts either too long and dragged out or simply unnecessary.  Also, much of the descriptions are repetitive.  Its burnt into my brain that Cathy has tiny pointed teeth, that Aron has a pretty face, that Ethel is dumb.  I must admit though, however boring it was, it did helped to paint a clear picture in my mind as I was reading the book.  I guess that's what makes it good writing!!!<br />All in all, Im glad I read this book.
B0000931OG|5.0|Coxon's departure was sad but we move on ( as we have to in some circumstances ) and we get this album - and what a brilliant album it is. Sure Crazy Beat is not really all that great in my opinion but the rest is in my opinion great. And you have to hear Me White Noise as it's the best thing I've heard in ages. If you want to hear it is press on track 1 and start rewinding and you should get it pretty well.<br />While it's sad that Coxon has left the band......what we have left is a band still creative and still hitting the right notes
B00002MZ12|5.0|I'll first start by saying that I am an enormous fan of Alanis Morissette. She is one the greatest female singers of all time, her songs are superbly melodic, her vocals are brilliant and she produces thought-provoking songs that touch me in no way any other artist has.<br /><br />I have owned \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" for almost a year now. It instantly became my favourite album ever, and nothing is going to change that anytime soon. I'm not exaggerating when I say I must've listened to it more than a thousand times - and that's quite a lot in the space of a year! I'm also confident that after this I will continue to listen to it for the rest of my life. I avoided buying \\"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\\" for a while as I had read some reviews that said it was nothing like Jagged Little Pill. I resisted for a while but I needed more material from Alanis so I bought the album in June earlier this year. I wasn't too keen at first, but I listened to it more and, well - let's just say I was in a state of musical bliss for months on end! It was totally euphoric, and I love the record to bits. \\"Under Rug Swept\\" is yet another superb album from Alanis, but it's not a patch on her first two albums. I now have all of Alanis' main studio albums and recently read that she is working on some new material. Which brings me to this review...<br /><br />I had bought all three of Alanis' major albums, so I decided to buy \\"Alanis Unplugged.\\" I didn't expect much, as I had heard all the songs before on the albums, but to my surprise yet again, I love this CD more than I expected! Alanis sings with such honesty and emotion when live. It's just herself and her microphone, along with hardcore fans taking in the energy surrounding them. It's very inspiring. The set kicks off in wonderful style with the song \\"You Learn.\\" From the Jagged Little Pill album, this song was a huge hit all over the world and one of the most-played radio hits of the 90's. Alanis is superb on it, and things get better with her powerful performance of \\"Joining You\\" from the Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie album.<br /><br />Alanis then sings a new song, \\"No Pressure Over Cappuccino,\\" said to be inspire about her brother and his sexual orientation. It's a great song, which is followed by \\"That I Would Be Good\\" and \\"Head Over Feet.\\" Another new song, \\"Princes Familiar,\\" is debuted next. It's the best 'new' song on the album, and it has the melodic excellence to rival anything from the Under Rug Swept album. Next comes a great performance of \\"I Was Hoping\\" and a high-pitched sunlit version of \\"Ironic.\\" Another new song comes along in the form of \\"These R The Thoughts,\\" which is followed by a cover-version of \\"King Of Pain.\\" The crowd goes wild for it, and so will the listener! Next comes a wonderfully diverse performance of Alanis' trademark hit \\"You Oughta Know.\\" The audience goes wild with excitement, and are then treated to the fabulous \\"Uninvited.\\"<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 9/10<br /><br />Out of all Alanis Morissette's albums, I'd say that \\"Alanis Unplugged\\" is probably the least important. If you want to get into her music, you should be buying Jagged Little Pill, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie and Under Rug Swept. Three essential albums. This CD is essential for hardcore fans, however, and we get to see the real Alanis. She jokes about spilling water over herself and thanks the audience at the end by saying, \\"Thank you. Very much. It's been such a pleasure. I love you.\\" She proves she isn't afraid of small spaces and groups of people, but most importantly, she proves that she is just human like the rest of us which has to be one of the most gifted and special parts of being a huge celebrity - remaining grounded and focused on the important things in life.rful performance of \\"Joining You\\" from the Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie album.

B000060P79|4.0|Overall, a great CD.  It has the perfect blend of fun, upbeat songs like &quot;I'd Do Anything&quot; and slower, more lyrically-focused songs such as &quot;Perfect.&quot;  It's a great debut album, and quite worth your money.
B00005JKN9|5.0|Finally, Martin Scorscese comes out with a film with such potential that it will make top ten of all time lists for years to come.  I recommend this movie to any person that is not squeamish.  Yes, I must note that there were many parts of the movie that are quite bloody.  But the acting and the story and the music and the costumes ALL make up for it.  Here are the four reasons you MUST see this movie, and why you will love it.<br />1. Daniel Day-Lewis: This man made the movie what it was.  He so passionately played Bill the Butcher that it overshadowed the other well-done roles, notibly Cameron Diaz, who I thought was not as bad as people have said she was.  He, by far, deserved the Oscar for Best Actor over Adrien Brody from \\"The Pianist.\\"  I did not think so until I actually saw the whole movie.  Boy, was I mistaken.<br />2. Revenge!: This movie is the greatest revenge film of all time.  Not only did it add a twist by having Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio)  become part of Bill's gang to gain his confidence, but the actors also helped everything along by conveying their shock and hatred so incredibly well.  Every thing about the plot was so well crafted that it sucks you in.<br />3. Good Old Irish Music: Throughout the movie there are little segments of Irish tunes being played in the backround.  Sometimes you feel it is out of place.  To me, that was the magic.  It seemed like behind all of the fun and happiness that came along with owning everything, there was always a conflict and always a battle, mental and physical.  It really added a lot to the film.<br />4. Beautiful Costumes: One essential part of displaying the culture of Old New York were, obviously, the costumes.  But these weren't your normal costumes.  There were top hats and flashy, colorful gowns and splendid gold buttons and astounding gang symbols.  It all created an atmosphere so different than ours that you felt as if you were actually there, in a way.<br />There are the four reasons why you should see this movie.  Here are a few disclaimers, though.  This is not a family film.  It has nudity in some parts and implied sex in others.  And the violance can be over the top.  There was one scene where an enormous puddle of blood was being splashed in by a few policemen.  I think that says it all.  And one or two parts may put you to sleep.  But remember, none of this can overshadow the epic proportions of everything else.<br />Bottom Line: Wow! (I give it an A+)
B0000BYM3K|5.0|This is the best album Iron Maiden has put out since Seventh Son!!!  Although I've loved every album since it, none have come close to is as this one has.  The orchestration and vocal melodies are awesome.  Other metal bands who have tried to use the orchestra bit should listen to the last two Iron Maiden albums to see how it should be done.  The production is real good, and the songs have awesome dynamics.  But then again, can you expect anything different from the mighty Iron Maiden.  But then again, I'm biased as Maiden has been my favorite band since 1983 (when I was in 3rd grade).  UP THE IRONS!!!!!!

B00008OE4W|5.0|This movie is a really fun ride!  It has a great story with great characters and an all star cast.  I have seen it many, many times and can't wait to get the DVD I ordered today!
B00008S2VG|4.0|I have much respect for Madonna, so she can do no wrong in my eyes.  This cd differs greatly from her others, but that is to be expected.  If you like the songs from the radio, you should get it, because there is more where that came from.  There is a twinge of religious lyrics in this cd, more so than usual.  It's one of those you have to listen to a couple of times to get into.
B00005JKEC|5.0|Training Day is awesome!<br />Beware, it is violent also.<br />It is intense, but a great movie.
B000008LOU|4.0|Since there is no spanish review of this album, that is a great cd, im going to take the responsability of review it in spanish.<BR>Traveling Wilburys no es una banda conocida, es mas nunca fue una banda (a mi punto de vista), sino un grupo de amigos que se conocian hace mucho tiempo y decidieron divertirse haciendo unos cds.<BR>Este cd, es un poco en honor a la muerte de Roy Orbison, por eso lo llamaron vol. 3, ya que era un paso mas adelante que dieron todos juntos para juntarse y dedicarle un poco esto a Roy Orbison, (como en los videos que sacaron, colocaron una foto de Roy en cada uno de ellos), fue y sera siempre un Traveling Wilbury.<BR>En el Vol.3 muchos dicen que no es tan bueno como el Vol.1, pero cada Vol. tiene lo suyo, y este es mas estilo country.<BR>Cada cancion tiene su alma, 7 deadly sins, es una de mis canciones favoritas, por la forma que juegan con las voces, una cancion muy 50 bailable, por como la armaron.<BR>She`s my baby, es la mas rockanrollera que tiene el cd.<BR>Es imposible que los Traveling Wilburys te permitan odiar sus canciones, porque todas son excelentes. Ni contar con los artistas que estan presente. Debio ser el sueo de quien los conocio en ese momento, poder haberlos visto en algun concierto, tambien hubiese sido el mio, si no lo hubiese conocido tarde. Recien los conoci por medio de mi hermano en el 98, tener a Jeff Lynne, George Harrison, Tom Petty y a Bob Dylan juntos es ya por si algo que no se lo puede calificar, porque algo divino no llegaria a los pies de lo que es. Cada uno aportando con la guitarra y sus voces en las canciones es ya de por si un hecho historico; musicos de esa magnitud unidos para regalarnos musica es para agradecerles eternamente.<BR>Eternally Greatful for the music that all of you gave us.<BR>Gracias/Thanks Sr. Lynne, Sr. Petty, Sr. Dylan.<BR>Que dios los tenga en la gloria (God Bless both of you) Sr. Harrison, Sr. Orbison.
B0000BYM3K|2.0|There is no denying that 2000's Brave New World was an excellent comeback album and a rebirth of Iron Maiden in many respects. Be forewarned that Dance Of Death is a sophmore slump so to speak, offering rehashed material that probably did not make the Brave New World cut and some throwbacks to Fear of The Dark.<br />The strength of Dance Of Death is Bruce's voice. It sounds incredible for a man in his mid-forties. This album also benefits from excellent production and some nice addition of keyboards that would have sounded better had the melodies of the songs been better. This is where the strengths end. Upon close inspection Dance of Death is an album full of repetetive and time-tested Iron Maiden techniques that now sound more forced than inspired.<br />The album starts with &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot; perhaps one of the best songs and most un-Maiden sounding. The verse and chorus melody lines are good but the guitar sounds more like Judas Priest with a decidedly upbeat happy progression probably due to Adrian Smith's contributions to the song. &quot;Raimaker&quot; is next and Bruce definitely sounds like his old self on this one but the songs is really average. <br />&quot;No More Lies&quot; is the first of (count them) four songs that start pratically the same way. Clean picked guitar lines that mimic Steve Harris bass lines  similar to the intro to the song &quot;Blood Brothers&quot;. Predictably, after about 2 minutes the distortion kicks in and continues through the song ending with the same music as the intro. In fact you might recognize this song follws the EXACT same formula and basically same melody as &quot;Mother Russia&quot;. Nothing new here. Then comes &quot;Montsegur&quot; using the Maiden formula of history for song topics and while it is probably the heaviest track it is boring and the vocals are not very good even during the chorus. <br />The eponymous title track offers another &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; intro but with the same subject practically as &quot;Number Of The Beast&quot; with the lyrics changed a bit it is still about a guy stumbling upon a macabre ritual. There is a Harris bass line and clean picked guitars stumbling along until the 2:50 mark where a distorted harmony line comes in that might be the best riff on the album.<br />&quot;Gates of Tomorrow&quot; is basically a rehash of &quot;From Here To Eternity&quot; except it is not as good and Bruce's vocals are subdued and muffled a bit on this one. Still it is one of the better songs on the album. &quot;New Frontier&quot; is basic straight- forward power chords thrown together with little imagination but the chorus line from Bruce sounds good and the little riff behind it is also adds to the song's appeal. &quot;Paschendale&quot; is Maiden's attempt to capture the spirit of war as in the &quot;The Trooper&quot; and &quot;Aces High&quot;. There are a lot of things going on with some classically influenced harmony runs but nothing really inspiring or memorable and the song is probably about 4 minutes too long leaving the song boring and ponderous.<br />&quot;Face In The Sand&quot; has yet another &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; intro with the distortion kicking in at the 1:30 mark but at least it does not end with the same intro. The songs is not bad but as you probably gathered it is predictable.<br />&quot;Age Of Innocence&quot; is a combination of &quot;Fear of The Dark&quot; and &quot;Still Life&quot; with the best chorus melody vocals from Bruce since &quot;Wasted Years&quot;. Unfortunately the guitars behind the chorus sound muddy and muffled, products of disastrous tone, mix, or both. <br />The last song gives us &quot;Dust In The Wind&quot; redone by Iron Maiden with a few changes and a new title, &quot;Journeyman&quot;. This is about as unsatisfying a Maiden song that has ever been put out and probably should have been left off the album.<br />The problem with this album is Maiden stick with the same song topic formulas and structures they have used on their last 4 albums. There is nothing fresh except for the keyboards which simply have mediocre foundations to be layered over and fail to sound inspiring. There are some classic sounding guitar runs on here that Savatge have been doing for longer and better than Maiden tried on this. The guitar harmonies also sound forced more because they are expected and not because they augment the song. On the positive side Bruce sounds outstanding and it is  some of his vocal lines that help save the album. The final problem is Maiden now have three guitarists but the songs still sound like 2. The verse riffs have all three guitars pounding out the same rhythym and the harmonies have a high and a low, still only two guitars. Maiden could have made the album a lot more interesting if they could have found a way to incorporate the three guitars to expand their sound instead of keeping it the same. This is probably a result of Harris's dicatorship over the band and his unbending adherence to the &quot;Iron Maiden&quot; formula which sadly sounds dated and uninspired in 2003.
B00004TL21|5.0|I love this album with a passion.  I love the Deftones overall, but this is my favorite.  If you don't know Deftones whatsoever, I advise you start with this one, then Around the Fur is a close tie to second, followed by the newest.  They're all amazing, so don't get me wrong. But they also have distinct moods about them.<br />I am a female, so I can say this without anyone being critical, but his voice in &quot;Korea&quot; is mind blowing, and guys, if you ever want to get a metal chick in the mood, just pop in White Pony and put number 8 on repeat.  This whole cd is good &quot;mood music&quot; though, if you know what I mean.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Every once in a while a movie comes along that really sticks with you. It goes beyond trying to dazzle you exclusively with special effects or grandiose story lines. Don't get me wrong, Two Towers certainly has these two down. But it doesn't stop there. <br />The visuals are stunning. Ice capped mountains, lush forests, and ornate castles are so detailed, so crisp, that you may forget this is just a movie.<br />The characters are developed with much effort and love. From Frodo, to Aragorn, to the evil Sarumon, you know their motivations,passion and conviction to have their victory. And you will find yourself rooting for some and against others.<br />The battle for Helms Deep is intense. As the rain pours down thousands of individual can be seen locked in combat. And it looks absolutely great! Some of the best mass battle scenes in film.<br />Watch this trilogy. I hope it stirs your heart as it did mine.
B00005QG9J|4.0|Sure, call me picky, but I was pretty sad when I heard this cd.  The same scale as when I heard the second Disturbed CD.  This cd is soooo mellow compared to the previous ones.  It's a good thing, I have come to realise, but at first it was a hard pill to swallow.  Sometimes if I have trouble sleeping, I put on the 'floating down a river' song and it works great.  Now that I have listened to this cd for quite sometime... there are many a great songs on it, but you have to give it a while if SCIENCE and Make Yourself are your visions of Incubus.
0812550706|5.0|I'm not the sci-fi or fantasy type, but this is one of my all-time favorite books because 1) It spoke directly to me (in other words, I identified with the characters) and 2) it caused me to reexamine my world because of the unexpected conclusions the book reached.
B000002JSJ|5.0|This is a very good consistent album, and very different than what was going on in 1976(Foriegner, Boston, Styx). That said, the music is execellent. Achilles Last Stand is another great epic with some fantastic drumming. For Your Life has a great riff. A very loose song. Royal Orleans has a nice funk flavor to it. Nobody's Fault But Mine is the real highlight of the album. It's a perefect blues-rock song. Candy Store Rock is another tribute to 50's rock, with Robert Plant doing the best Elvis impression he could. Hots On For Nowhere is another cool loose song. Tea For One is a bit depressing, but it's got some cool lead stuff. Great album.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|I am not very surprised at the mixed reviews this album is getting, from critics especially.  Neil Young, when he is on the mark, usually does get mixed reviews.  And I can't help but wonder if the strong criticisms of the media in the songs are the cause of the mediocre reviews.  I'm sure it isn't helping. <BR>I don't love every song on the album, but the album as a whole I think is great.  I liked it so much I bought a copy for my dad and one for a friend.  Both of them love the album.  <BR>I saw Neil Young this summer and he performed the whole album live.  The songs stuck with me for the three weeks I had to wait until the album came out. <BR>Honestly, the DVD that came with the album was worth the money I spent.   Where the album is almost entirely electric, the DVD is a live acoustic set.  It gives the album a whole new spin, he tells the story in between the songs. <BR>It seems to me the songs are like snapshots of different people, places, and events used to illustrate what is going on in our culture right now. observations anyway. It is not a linear story line, far more stream of consciousness.
B000002JSN|5.0|1975 was the last great year of rock. A lot of the old bands from the 70's were slowly fading away, and this album, along with Black Sabbath's Sabotage, is the best album of 1975. The production is terrific, the playing is incredible, and the songs are awesome. Disc 1 is the reason alone to get the album with songs like In My Time Of Dying, Custard Pie, Trampled Underfoot, and Kashmir. The 2nd disc has some excellent unknown ones, like The Wanton Song, Down By The Seaside, Night Flight, Black Country Woman, and Sick Again. My personal favorite from Disc1 is In My Time Of Dying. The longest song they ever did, it is a great jam and one of the best songs in the Led Zeppelin catalog. The 2nd disc would have to be Boogie With Stu. Just a really good bluesy song that's a great tribute to 50's rock. A superb album.
B000063T0T|3.0|If you are hoping that the whole score and all the musical numbers are found in the collector's edition, you will be disappointed. First, the tracks are not ordered in the manner as they occurred in the film.  Song bits from the &quot;Sound of Music&quot; and from the Green Fairy are missing. You don't get the film version (which sounds way better!) of &quot;Your Song&quot; or &quot;Children of the Revolution&quot; on either disc. &quot;El Tango de Roxanne&quot; would've been better if the intro dialogue was included. I personally would've liked the soundtrack collection to include some of the notable lines/quotes from the movie as supplemental tracks.  The collection is good, but you aren't getting everything that you hope to.  My solution to this problem, buy the dvd, capture the songs to your computer, and create your own soundtrack!  I created my own &quot;soundtrack&quot; (for my own use) and it's better than the collector's edition could ever be!
B00005N53P|5.0|What can i say? This is one of the best albums i've ever heard. The first time i heard it i couldn't stop for months. Over and over again. What does that mean? It means it's a excellent album. You can listen to it in the morning, during the day, at night, and to go to sleep to. This music has something that most other music doesn't have. Substance. And it's really catchy too! But i'm fed up of haters who critisise the band just because they were rich when they were kids. What these people don't know is that the strokes worked very hard to get where they are now. And they deserve it. I hope the next album is as good as this, maybe even better. BUY THIS ALBUM!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|I cannot emphasize how FABULOUS this album is. After the so-so offering that was Brave New World, the boys from Britain come back with a masterpiece. Dickinson, now approaching his 48th bday, has a voice that can make me cry at times. The incredible riffs and guitar solos from guitar god Janick Gers supplement Dickinsons's voice perfectly. This album is pure perfection, a must have for any rock fan or any genre, be it soft rock or heavy metal. This is the best 13 dollars i have ever spend and probably will spend in the future. I cannot stress how good this album is. Fav songs: Rainmaker(beautiful melody and purely poetic lyrics), Montsegur(incredible lyrics and a sick solo), and the 8 minute heart-wrenching Dance of Death; the peak comes at a 3.5 min solo which makes you want to cry with envy when you realize you will NEVER be as good as Gers.Get this cd now. If there was a 10 star rating this album would get it. Album of the year, hands down.
B000002JS6|5.0|This Album is dedicated to AC/DC's late lead singer, the inimitable Bon Scott. From the beginning AC/DC brings you into a world of Rock N Roll like nobody else can. The signature opening of Hells Bells is enough to get anyones adrenaline going and make the hair on the back of your neck stand up. The song Back in Black is another one that gets you going, as does You Shook Me All Night Long.  These two songs make you just want to cut loose and sing along.  Have A Drink On Me is a bar room classic.  And the last track, Rock And Roll Aint Noise Pollution makes you wanna play slow air guitar and pay homage to Gibson extraordinaire Angus Young and Company in this salute to a great Rock And Roll legend from the greatest Rock band of all time, AC/DC.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I can't give this CD any more praise than has already been given by others.  The selections are thoughtful, the delivery poignant and powerful.  Mr Cash was at the peak of his form right up til the very end.<BR>I feel compelled to address the small people who've marred this forum with libel instead of objective opinion.  Grow up.  And get your facts straight.  &quot;40 years ago he would have been blacklisted&quot;?  Seems to me that 40 years ago he was much wilder than he is now, but I don't recall ever hearing about him being banned from the airwaves or public appearance.  And my IQ?  It's 165.  What's yours?
B0000A7W14|5.0|Finally, &quot;Boyz N The Hood&quot; gets proper treatmant on DVD with a double-disc special edition. John Singleton's film debut was one of the first films to take a realistic look at what was really going on in many urban California neighborhoods at the time. Telling parts of his own childhood story, Singleton gave us some deep, social commentary mixed with some groundbreaking performances from a number of relative newcomers.<br />Cuba Gooding, Jr. is Tre Styles, a young black male growing up in South Central during the turbulent and violent early 90's. Under the watching eyes and guiding hand of his father, Furious (played brilliantly by Laurence Fishburne), Tre learns life's difficult lessons as with friends and family, he battles the harsh world that is out there on the streets.<br />&quot;Boyz N The Hood&quot; is one of the most movies that is hard to forget. Once you've seen it, chances are that you will want to experience it again. While later films in the genre exploited violent images and often glorified them for entertainment purposes, this movies touches on the emotion behind the violence. When there is violence even towards characters that we may perceive as &quot;bad&quot;, the film shows us the honest consquences.<br />While there are many excellent performances here, it is first-time actor Ice Cube's portrayal of &quot;Dough Boy&quot; that really had audiences talking. No matter how many times I view the film's emotional climax, I always &quot;feel&quot; it. Cube's closing monolouge is just so genuine and powerful. As he walks off, fading into memory, we feel that loss. Dough Boy isn't some poor black sterotype that blows away people without thinking twice. He has human qualities. Even when he is doing things we don't agree with it, he is sympathetic. He is angry about the lack of love that he gets from his mother who praises his brother but shuns him. Despite fighting with his brother, he still runs to his rescue, moments later. Dough Boy is portrayed in a way that he can be hard-edged but we still can relate to his suffering. That seems to be what is missing from many of these hood films that try to duplicate &quot;Boyz&quot;.<br />&quot;Boyz N The Hood&quot; was and still is one of the most important films in the genre. This DVD offers a lot of things that many fans have been waiting for such as an audio commentary, a featurette looking back at the film's making, and two deleted scenes. While the first omitted scene is a rather pointless back and forth between Gooding's Tre and his mother, played by Angela Basset, the second scene featuring the movie's stand-out characters Dough Boy and Furious is excellent. This DVD is definetly worth picking up for any true fan of this epic film.ayed in a way that he can be hard-edged but we still can relate to his suffering.

B000089RVX|4.0|Why did I title my review after the incredible lead singer of this band? Because this might as well be Amy Lee's self-titled debut album. She sings every song. Just as Matchbox Twenty could be billed &quot;Rob Thomas&quot;, Evanescence could be billed &quot;Amy Lee&quot;.<br />That said, this CD is absolutely thrilling to listen to. From songs of anguish and independence (EVERYBODY'S FOOL, GOING UNDER) to the thrilling radio-embraced single (BRING ME TO LIFE) to a touching ballad (MY IMMORTAL) to strange lyrics set to songs that will thrill you to no end and beckon<br />you back for repeated listens (WHISPER, HAUNTED) and 2 perfect songs (TAKING OVER ME, TOURNIQUET) this album has it all if you're looking for good quality music. The only thing you won't find here is contentment. This fast-moving album is definitely 11 tracks that none of which is worth skipping.<br />Although this album is technically not their debut (their 2001 debut album ORIGIN is out of print and can be found in obscure places for a 1/4 grand) it may as well be. It certainly will be remembered as their debut, without a doubt. Still, it's hard to imagine their sound becoming more evolved than this. On their &quot;debut&quot; album, it already seems that Evanescence has evolved as far as it can, or at least needs to. That should certainly make listening to further albums something to look forward to with anticipation.
B00005MP58|5.0|As a huge fan of Jane Austen's works, I have to confess I try to find something worthwhile in any/all productions I have watched of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; over the years.  The BBC miniseries starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle eclipses all film and live versions I have seen to date.  First and foremost it is painstakingly faithful to the book in its script and characterizations and the performances are absolutely charming. Simon Langton's direction succeeds in conveying volumes to the audience, often when no words are spoken; the same sublety that captivated audiences in his brilliant work in &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; is prevalent in P &amp; P and allows the viewer an added dimension in understanding the story and its characters.  The scenery is magnificent and the set designs and costumes are painstakingly recreated with attention to the book's details and realism for the period. <br />I recommend it highly to all (a must-see for Austen fans) especially for those not familiar with her works, it would be a wonderful introduction.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I will keep this short this Miniseries is GREAT! I LOVED IT! Great Cast Damian Lewis is a Terrific actor. Watch it you wont be sorry. I bought it without ever seeing it before and I wasn't sorry it was the best 89 bucks I spent.
B000002GBD|4.0|This was Nazareth's most famous album, but not their best.  Few fans are even aware that they released five albums BEFORE this one!  I'm not a big fan of the title track and \\"Love Hurts\\", simply because they're overplayed on the radio.  However, the latter is painfully emotional with some heartfelt, gorgeous slide guitar.  But the real defining moment on here is the monstrous \\"Miss Misery\\".  This is undoubtedly one of the heaviest, most aggressive songs ever recorded.  Those of you who thought that Black Sabbath were the heaviest band of that era better listen long and hard to this song.  It sounds angry enough to kill, and Dan wails out the vocals over a POUNDING beat from the rest of the band.  This is just heavy metal glory!  Add to this some excellent jams like \\"Changin' Times\\", the funky \\"Beggar's Day\\" and \\"Please Don't Judas Me\\", and you have one awesome album.  And then there's \\"Rose In The Heather\\", a beautiful guitar instrumental that few people seem to like for some reason.  Personally, I love it.  Oh, and I almost forgot about \\"Whiskey Drinkin' Woman\\", which is also fantastic.  And this is the only song on the album in which Dan does not use his 'screechy' voice.  The guy could sing in about four or five different vocal styles, and was really an overlooked vocalist.  So yes, this album is definitely a killer but if you want to hear Nazareth at their best and most raw, get \\"Razamanaz\\" or the debut album, both of which are almost impossible to find, thanks to the record companies.<BR>By the way, Nazareth puts Black Sabbath to shame any day of the week.
B00005JM02|5.0|We saw this one in the theater and my 3 year old girl sat still for the whole thing.  Tear-jerker at points and adventurous too.  I would definitely recommend it for all ages.
0385504209|1.0|This book was a waste of an acre of trees!  This book was fragmented, and a waste of reading.  By the time you figure out why people are being killed you want to throw the book out!  I returned the book after reading it twice, all the way to the end!  The storyline stinks and if you want an EXCELLENT read, by something by Stephen King or Michael Crichton, even Anne Rice!  Do NOT WASTE your money on this book!
0140182829|5.0|Le Grand Meaulnes (sometimes translated as The Wanderer or The Lost Domain) is one of those little books that often gets overlooked.  Partly because the writer Alain Fournier was killed at an early age in World War I and this is his only novel.<br />But what a great little work.  Rarely has someone captured so well that elusive period in life known as adolesence.  The characters are teenagers at an isolated school - not quite children and not quite adults.  Fournier captures that feeling with a plot that is at times detailed and very realistic and at other times more surreal and like a fairy tale.  <br />The school is realistic enough.  Later the popular student Augustin Meaulnes sneaks out and meets a lovely girl at a strange party in an equally isolated manor.  A huge chain of events ensue from that meeting - sometimes tragic and sometimes brimming with life. <br />For its first readers the dream like nostalgia in this book reflected the earlier, simpler time before the First World War. For contemporary readers that joy and pain of adolescent youth still rings remarkably true.  Definitely worth reading if you enjoy coming of age stories that are more magical than crude.
B00006SFBD|5.0|this was my first opeth cd and all i can say is wow. it just has a certian feeling to it and the production is A+++.they are just awsome at what they do and i hope they can do it for a long time to come must buy for all metal heads
B0000019PA|5.0|jeff magnum evokes a magical quality that is missing from the vast majority of music these days. normally i go for more &quot;noisier&quot; music, but i think that anyone who listens to this album with an open mind will find themselves touched by it (if not completely blown away)
B00007LTIC|5.0|I was a little bit questionable about buying the new Yes remasters but broke down and I am glad I did.  These sound great, wow, unbelievable sound quality, crystal clear and bright.  After Wakeman was replaced for The Relayer album, (which is also great, but another review) he was back for another classic Going For The One.  After The Yes Album, Edge, and Fragile established Yes as a mainstay and the true originators of progressive music in the 70's, they released a few that were questionable by some fans but not me.  After Tales and Relayer, the original line-up was back for a classic.  Going for the one is definately ranked in the top 4 Yes albums.  <br />     We start off with the quick Going for the One tune, which features amazing guitar by Howe and is a bit different the anything they have done.  Next, we have the beautiful Turn of the Century which is a very underrated Yes tune.  Next, one of my all time Squire Yes favs, Parallels and on the remaster breathes new life and is just awesome, wow, what a tune!!!<BR>Next up, another beautiful Anderson song, Wonderous Stories and the best is saved for last, AWAKEN, has to be in the top 5 Yes songs ever.  This is just an amazing 15 minute piece of work.  Wakeman has his part in the middle of the song and is very intense, then back into the song, just wonderful, speechless, beauty.  In short, if you have this in the old version, I feel this Yes remaster is the most improved sound wise, experience Going for the One again in all it's beauty!!!
0333989902|5.0|I bought this book in Scotland two years ago and my grandchildren and grand nieces and nephews have absolutely loved it.  They never seem to get tired of reading it and the repetition doesn't bother me.  I was sold when I overheard a grandfather reading it to his grandson in the store.  It is delightful.
B000002H6C|3.0|This of course, is Metallica's 4th album, the one they made after bassist Cliff Burton died in a bus wreck.  The album is by far more complex, one of the most complex albums of all time, but nowhere near the #1 (Rust In Peace by Megadeth).  The riffs are much more techinal, which is good is most cases, but occasionally it seems as if they tried too hard.  Kirk Hammet on this album looks as if he finally abandoned his one solo style, and tried something different, which he couldn't quite do (with the exception of &quot;one&quot; certain song...).<br />1. Blackened: One of the best Metallica songs ever, the fade intro is the best fade intro of all time, along with the riff after that being my favorite on the album, and one of my favorites.  The whole song is great, with the short and sweet chorus.  The solo is okay, somewhat reminescent in Ride the Lightning's solo, that it goes from slow to fast.  <BR>Rating: A<br />2. ...And Justice For All: After two albums with incredible title tracks, Metallica puts out yet another great one.  While it isn't quite what you'd expect, it is still a solid song.  A quite difficult intro, and then the main riff is just astounding.  The song has a very clear message, yet at certain points you'd almost wish the song would end already!<BR>Rating: B+<br />3. Eye of the Beholder: Another great intro, although very repetitive, still good.  The overall song is definitely a slower, with yet another political message in the song.  Probably equal to the title track.<br />Rating: B+<br />4. One: The best of the Metallica ballad songs, with the great solo at the beginning of the song.  The highlight, of course, is the main solo and on.  Kirk finally puts out a great solo not written by Dave Mustaine, and it is his best.  But my favorite part is the solo/lead after the main solo, with the rising and falling it seems.  Great song.<BR>Rating: B+<br />5. The Shortest Straw: Now the album starts to get weaker, in this song.  While it does have a somewhat decent riff, the chorus is repeated far too often and is way lacking in everything.  Nothing too special about this song except the riff.<BR>Rating: C+<br />6. Harvester of Sorrow: Worst song on the album.  Way too slow and groggy and depressive (not the good depressive kind, which will be mention a little bit later).  Just an all out bad song.<BR>Rating: C-<br />7. Frayed Ends of Sanity: Finally!  The album starts to get good again.  Starting off with the awesome flying monkies intro, into a slow, yet good riff.  The riff during the lyrics, is completely awesome, along with the lyrics themselves.  The chorus is one of the best on the albums, but the highlight is, the riff right before the solo.  Maybe the best riff of all time, and a very fast as well.<BR>Rating: A-<br />8. To Live is to Die: From 4:58 to 6:46 this is offcially the saddest song of all time.  The song that commerates Cliff Burton is a very strong song, and you van clearly feel how sad the rest of the band was on that tragic day.  The song speaks for itself in how good it is.<BR>Rating: A<br />9. Dyer's Eve: The fastest song on the album, the verse has NOTHING to offer, except a couple lowsy power chords!  The chorus, however, is great.  The solo is good as well, but the rest of the song...bleh.<BR>Rating: B-<br />So, if you were a big fan of MoP, I'd recommend getting this album.  Well, I'd reccomend it anyways, but ge sure to get MoP and RtL first, and NOT St. Anger.
0446608955|5.0|'A Walk To Remember' is a beautifully written novel. The story line evloves around the love of two teenagers and it shows that love can strike at any age. What makes this novel so good is the charatcher building and how they share their love for each other. <BR> There are parts in this novel that make it a romance classic, and this is a MUST read novel if you are a romantic type of person like me. <BR> There are parts in this novel that made me cry, and also it made me happy to see that these two people found love, and also it teaches how you can lose that love but still you change as a person inside and out. <br />GREAT NOVEL.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|A film by Chris and Paul Weitz<br />About a Boy is based on the Nick Hornby novel of the same name.  In this movie we meet Will (Hugh Grant).  Will is a single man who lives by himself and has never held a job in his life.  See, Will's father wrote a popular Christmas song and Will is able to live off of the royalties.  He may hate the song, but it allows him to live the life in the manner that he sees fit, which is just as self-centered as you can imagine it would be.  Will is in his late 30's and he went to a single parent's group meeting in the hopes to meet a single parent (he has found they make great temporary girlfriends).  He has to fake having a child to do this and ends up dating one for a little while.  In a round-about way this lets Will meet Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), the young son of Fiona (Toni Collette).  It is better seen than explained how Will and Marcus become friends/associates, but this relationship is central to the entire movie because it affects how Will approaches Rachel (Rachel Weisz), a woman he is very attracted to, and it affects his entire life.<br />This was a very realistic feeling film and I can't say that there was a real weakness in it.  The heart of the movie is the relationship between Will and Marcus and throughout the movie we can see a transformation of who Will is and who Will is becoming (and wants to become).<br />I'll be honest, I've never thought much of Hugh Grant as an actor, but I thought that he did a fantastic job in the movie.  Surely this was his best role in his entire career.  I did not expect much out of this movie, but I think it will end up being one of the best movies of 2002.  Some people have called in THE best movie of 2002, but I am not willing to quite go that far.  It is an excellent movie and I would highly recommend it.
0553212621|1.0|d.h. lawrence sure is good at inflating banalities, the whole book is a mere concatenation of pseudo-intellectual, relentlessly boring blabber, some plot interspersed.<BR>for real literature read madame bovary.
B000001EAQ|4.0|This album contains some of U2's best songwriting, which makes this album bittersweet. Some of their best, most well-rounded songs, over-produced in a cucoon of electronic noise. That doesn't mean that songs like &quot;Discotheque&quot;, &quot;Do You Feel Love&quot;, &quot;If God Will Send His Angels&quot;, &quot;Staring at the Sun&quot;, &quot;Last Night on Earth&quot;, &quot;Gone&quot;, &quot;Please&quot; or &quot;Wake Up Dead Man&quot; aren't good songs. The writing is great, but the way they're put together isn't the best. You can tell they were a little too conscious of the way these songs would sound and spent too long polishing them, taking away most of the soul. Great songs, leaves more to be desired from them. Great album nonethless.

B00006LIRI|2.0|Once again, we have been duped by the U2 money-making machine. I can't even think which omission is the worst: \\"The Fly\\" or \\"Lemon\\". Once again, I will list off my gripes:<br />1) The tracklist. A problem with their first best of, a big problem here, on both discs. First off, \\"Stuck in a Moment\\" is NOT deserving of a spot here by a longshot! The lyrics are touching, but it's FLUFF!! Nowhere near the power of \\"The Fly\\" or the glitz of \\"Lemon\\". \\"The Hands the Built America\\" is quite possibly the most bloodless song U2 has ever written. Bono himself admitted it was written for an Oscar exclusively, and it shows. Horrible choice to add this.<BR>2) The new songs. \\"Electric Storm\\" I have no problem with, I think it's a wonderful song, the Orbit mix is especially promising. \\"...America\\" I have said enough about. But they don't fit the title! Both are from 2002, why are they on an album with songs from 1990 to 2000? I guess a compilation with no \\"Fly\\" or \\"Lemon\\" wouldn't have sold without the promise of new songs.<BR>3) The new mixes. What was wrong with them in the first place?? I can appreciate the new mix for \\"Gone\\", closer to the live version from Elevation which is much meatier. The mix for \\"Staring at the Sun\\" just adds a bit more drums, and \\"Numb\\" doesn't seem to be any different at all. \\"Discoteque\\" however, is absolutely raped: whatever zing, whatever edge that song had on \\"Pop\\" is taken away here. I can't fathom anyone enjoying this new mix.<BR>4) The B-sides. More a collection of mediocre dance mixes than actual B-sides. Where's \\"Salome\\"? What a waste of extra money.<br />That's not to say there's no redeeming factors in this album. After all, it has to warrant those two stars. And here's the reason why: the songs. Barring that it's missing big hits like \\"The Fly\\" and \\"Lemon\\", not to mention album highlights like \\"Ultraviolet\\", \\"Zooropa\\" \\"The Wanderer\\" (with Johnny Cash), \\"So Cruel\\", \\"Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses\\", \\"Zoo Station\\" and \\"Mofo\\", it still containssome brilliant songs from this band who reinvented themselves so vitally for a new decade. I was especially pleased to see \\"Hold Me Thrill Me Kiss Me Kill Me\\" and \\"Miss Sarajevo\\" would be included: excellent songs that deserve to be heard. \\"The First Time\\", a slight song from \\"Zooropa\\" is also a surprise but welcome choice here.<br />So all in all, another decade that would be better served with your own burnt collection. Another money-making scam devised that doesn't really offer anything worth buying. Great band, great music, poor choice.
B000099T2L|3.0|After all the hype this album was getting, i was disappointed when i finally purchased it. First of all i was hoping that the title track 'Dangerously In Love' was a different song to the one on 'Destiny's Child Survivor'. Of course i was in for a shock beacuse it was the same song. What was Beyonce thinking reusing that material? The only kinda good songs in my opinion are 'That's How You Like It', 'Yes', 'Crazy in Love ' and 'Baby Boy'. Another thing is that her vocabulary seems rather limited. I'm tired of hearing the words 'honesty, integrity, gratefully' etc. in her songs. Overall the album was a no no, Mya's is better by far.
B000001EHS|4.0|I would consider myself a casual Def Leppard fan: I have a copy of &quot;Hysteria&quot; and this greatest hits package, and it's very satisfying for me. They were probably the best hair metal band of the Eighties and their hits (and nothing else) is packaged in this album. Who could ask for more? Awesome for an ol'-fashioned nostalgia party. ROCK ON!
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Not that I'm complaining, but you can really notice the similarities between Klaus Badelt here on Pirates and Hans Zimmer in Gladiator.<BR>And that's great!<BR>There's one thing I have to ask though, I saw in the trailers that Alan Silvestri was the composer for Pirates. So what's going on there?<BR>Oh well.<BR>The movie just came out here in Australia (on September 11), and the soundtrack isn't out here yet, but having downloaded the soundtrack, I love it, and will buy it. Definitely. It is moving, powerful, dark, and something great to listen to when you want your blood pumping and to remind yourself of the movie (which I thought was GREAT!)
B000001FKY|5.0|I rarely listen to Side Two, but they could have packaged the first side together, thrown in &quot;Hysteria&quot; and released the greatest album ever made. I won't complain about the other songs from the second side, like &quot;Gods of War&quot;, &quot;Don't Shoot Shotgun&quot; or &quot;Love and Affection&quot;, but after a run of singles like the first side...well, who could still breathe after a flawless run like that? Amazing album, one of the best of the Eighties, and the best for any frat party (not that I'd know, of course...).
B000002KGT|5.0|My dad bought a CD copy of this album only last year. Nine of the eleven tracks have been recycled for THE VERY BEST OF FLEETWOOD MAC. Those not on that compilation are I DON'T WANT TO KNOW and OH DADDY. According to the book ROCK ON ALMANAC by Norm N. Nite,this album was on the Top 100 for a record of three and a half years!(February 1977 to August 1980) I heard a lot of these songs on the satellite feed at one of my former workplaces. The band's GREATEST HITS album has DREAMS,GO YOUR OWN WAY,DON'T STOP and YOU MAKE LOVING FUN. The year this album was released former Fleetwood Mac member Bob Welch,the first American to join the band,released his FRENCH KISS album with the smash hit SENTIMENTAL LADY which was previously recorded by the band for 1972's BARE TREES. TANGO IN THE NIGHT,released ten years after RUMOURS,didn't spawn as many hits as this album. My dad bought this album because of the song GOLD DUST WOMAN,a hit not on the GREATEST HITS album.
B000001E18|5.0|What a delicious slice of experimental music turning to gold. The overlooked ... son of \\"Achtung Baby!\\", this album is very experimental, and thus extremely rewarding. Each of these songs is a little pocket symphony (well, not really) with its own flavor that stands together as a well-moulded work. The joke is that it took only a few months to make, right in the middle of the band's busy tour schedule. Overlooked by many, but it's a fantastic album, very unlike U2. The highlights are the rumbling \\"Dirty Day\\", the epic title track, the amazing \\"Babyface\\" and the sparkling \\"Lemon\\". To be fair, they're all highlights, except the tiring \\"Numb\\". Too overplayed, not the greatest. GET THIS ALBUM!
B00005QIPH|3.0|Others have written here about the music itself, so I won't go into that other than to say I like it a lot, though it's not exactly anything groundbreaking.  If Americans weren't so fascinated with Britney Spears and prefabricated junk like that they'd realize there are LOTS of good bands out there (The Strokes, The White Stripes, Supergrass, Fountains of Wayne, etc.).    My only real problem with this album is that it's so terribly recorded.  It sounds like I'm listening to it through a pillow-- all muffled.  Hopefully their next album will sound better.  I'm all for that \\"raw\\" sound that seems to be \\"in\\" right now with bands such as this and The White Stripes, but if this is raw, I say cook it a little and let me hear it more clearly.    Favorite Track:  Last Nite
B000003TAR|5.0|This was the album everyone hoped Nirvana wouldn't make. What they were hoping for was another smoothly polished rock album. What they got was an uncompromising and often unlistenable, but ultimately more intriguing work of art. And it was exactly those things that made &quot;In Utero&quot; work. It is well known that during this period, Kurt Cobain was undergoing severe problems with unexpected fame, a ridiculed marriage to Hole's bad girl Courtney Love and unfounded accusations of child abuse (Courtney was blamed for taking heroin during her pregnancy). The end result of the turmoil was &quot;In Utero&quot;. The album was greeted with mixed results, but it got a big thumbs-up from who it mattered most: Cobain. It's only fitting that Nirvana's last studio album was the one Cobain said he dreamed of making, the one that most closely captured the noise in his head. In time, it has been acknowledged as an album more respected than listened to. Still, it's astounding to think of the impact Nirvana made with only two major albums, and the potential that was taken away by Kurt selfish act. Terribly sad, but a fitting way to burn out.
038533558X|5.0|Months ago \\"Gone For Good\\" by Harlan Coben was paired with my debut novel \\"Righteous Revenge\\" by Amazon in a 2 - for a better price deal. At that time I did not realize what a great compliment they paid my novel with the pairing. Curiosity finally won and I ordered Coben's book. \\"Gone For Good\\" has turned me into a Harlan Coben fan and I promptly ordered several more Coben novels.<br /> Growing up, Will Klein's hero is his older brother Ken. Now Ken is hiding from the law and Will longs to prove that his brother is not the killer everyone believes. With more curves than a slinky, Coben draws readers into a narrative destined to keep you up until dawn. The author's characters drip with reality, his scenes fill the imagination and readers end up in the midst of an action-packed drama sure to satisfy your appetite for adventure. If you are a fan of well-written adventures you will enjoy \\"Gone For Good.\\"<br />Beverly J Scott author of \\"Righteous Revenge\\" and \\"Ruth Fever.\\" Reviewer for Intriguing Authors and Their Books at [...]
B00005B4GU|4.0|Nothing can touch the immortal &quot;Kid A&quot;, but then again, not much can. We all know the backstory of this album, and there's no reason to reiterate it further. It is an excellent album that combines Radiohead's past and future and is the blueprint for their current sound. Although I can't really listen to the album anymore for personal reasons, I still like to revisit it and see the genesis of Radiohead's sound on &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot;. Great album, you shouldn't dismiss it.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|This is a very good album.  It is not Iron Maiden's best.  IMO that designation HAS to go to Powerslave. Like some of Maiden's more recent albums, it has high and low points, although this album has no bad songs.  High points: Rainmaker, Age of Innocence, New Frontier, Paschendale, Monsegur, Wildest Dreams, in that order.  Lower points would include No More Lies and Gates of Tomorrow, although they're ok songs.  The guitars are great here, and there is a return to harmony, which I enjoy.  I disagree with some reviewers who love Janick Gers.  IMO, he is by far the weakest of the big three.  Dave and Adrian just have that something special (perhaps their playing just reminds me of old Maiden).  Bruce sounds very good, but with hints of the \\"bad\\" years, though, in the eary '90's, where he sounded way too exhausted.  Nicko and Steve, like usual, kick butt and no complaints here.  The subject matter of the songs is par for the course for Maiden - very cool, especially Paschendale.  The last song is different and not bad at all, but it sounds a bit funny hearing Maiden sing a \\"mellow\\" tune given their history. All in all, I recommend this album to Maiden fans.  To me, it's equal to Brave New World, which was a great album.  Having listened to Iron Maiden religiously since the early '80's, I honestly believe this is a great album.  However, it's falls a little short of those years where they were the best - '83-'88.
B00005QXXO|5.0|While this album would have been well-served with some more tracks - perhaps from the &quot;OK Computer&quot; era - you can't complain about the brilliant transition that &quot;Kid A&quot; songs make unto the live stage. &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; is especially brilliant, turned from a backwards-looping soundscape into a haunting piano elegy. The price is steep for an 8-song live EP with no booklet, but the songs are great.
B000006045|5.0|Two Words to describe : SIMPLY AMAZING!!<br />All the tracks ar incredible...!!!<br />Just BUY IT right now!
B00000DFSK|3.0|I'm sorry. I'm a huge fan of U2's, but I still can't get myself to like this album. First of all, SO many glaring omissions from their early albums! I can understand if they feel &quot;Gloria&quot; is really dated, but hey, time tends to do that to songs. Nothing from &quot;October&quot; (unless you count the title track, buried as a hidden song), only one song from &quot;Boy&quot;, and the versions they add here are not to my liking: the single versions. What is the point of adding &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot; if you slay the majestic organ intro, quite possibly the greatest intro in recorded history?? &quot;Bad&quot; is also cut down here, as is &quot;New Year's Day&quot; (which I've never really liked).<BR>The entire album is only 65 minutes long, which begets my first question of why not more songs? &quot;A Sort of Homecoming&quot;? &quot;40&quot;?? &quot;MLK&quot;? Where are these classics? I'm sure it's not because of time restraints that they are missing. My other major complaint is the abundance of &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; tracks. I can understand &quot;Desire&quot;, but &quot;Angel of Harlem&quot; - though pleasant - is fluff at best, and &quot;When Love Comes to Town&quot; - with BB King - does NOT belong here, no matter what anyone says. The saving grace is the rare B-sides, most of which showcase U2's growth throughout the decade. Could have been a much better collection, absolutely. It really reeks of commercial profit over creativity in selection.
B000065LZM|4.0|I bought this album only because it was &quot;amazing&quot; at least thats what my friend said. i wasn't blown away but i did really like it. i can't compare it to anyone because he sounds like no one. but i'll definitely be picking up some more tom waits.
B000003TA4|5.0|Twelve years can do so much. It still seems like yesterday when you tuned into MTV and saw a grimy pep gathering in a rank gym. A clean, impossibly simple chord progression suddenly lurches into heavy distorsion while the drums threaten to bash your skull in. And in those 12 seconds, a legend was born; the orgasmic, angry rush of Gen-X was completed, and the world changed. It was the penultimate musical and cultural moment of the decade, the end of one era and the start of another. Or so we thought. Of course, we all know the sad story of the brilliant, magnetic and utterly tormented Kurt Cobain: a nobody with no intentions of going big, suddenly on top of the world with more adoration than he can handle, in the cold ground within two years. Before Kurt and Nirvana, the music world was a festering wasteland: after him, the music world was a festering wasteland, with pale imitations of his brilliant band that only make life worse. No band has had such a sudden and immediate impact on the culture since perhaps the Beatles (Joy Division's was more gradual, though just as short). And even though Nirvana would make a better album in &quot;In Utero&quot;, they would never top the impact of &quot;Nevermind&quot; and its still-excitable and awesome tracklist that reads like a greatest hits on its own. It could be argued that this album isn't as strong as people would care to think; that it didn't really change everything in the long run, but rather killed rock and opened the doors for the Teen Plague. That the songs are dilute Pixies tributes (a thought supported by Kurt himself). That it was overproduced. None of these facts could be argued against too easily, but the one fact that is interchangable is the fact that this album was American rock's last hurrah; enormous in its impact, bigger in its lasting influence. People will tell me that Bjork, Beck or Beastie Boys deserve the top spot, but I have to disagree and give it to the little blond man who came to us as if straight from heaven: infallible in his short career, touching so many lives and tearing apart so much more in his selfish final act. Wherever he is, I'm sure he's enjoying seeing people debate over his influence in his small worldly output. Rest in peace: thanks for the music.
B00009RDG9|4.0|The Hunted is an action movie fan's dream come true. But first, a note:  the &quot;cruelty of hunting&quot; is never really a theme of the movie, at any point. Watch closely; those two &quot;hunters&quot; Del Toro's character kills are not hunters but rather &quot;sweepers,&quot; sent to kill him. Similar to Jones's character in &quot;Under Seige,&quot; who has an attempt made on his life by his employer, the CIA. Then he takes over a ship and Steven Seagal gets to display his acting skills...<BR>     Well. The knife fights are fantastic. Not realistic, as they probably wouldn't last more than one or two slashes in reality, but fantastic as in well-choreographed and well-acted. <BR>     Also interesting is Tom Brown Jr.'s involvement with the film. Brown is a man who learned tracking (among other things) as a child. He owns a tracker school in New Jersey. He was an advisor on the film, and taught the actors a number of things, including how to flake stones into knives, and other fun stuff. He has a ton of fascinating books, containing a combination of practical advice and insight on survival and everyday life, as well as spiritual insight, which, like all spiritual insight, can be taken with a grain of salt and possibly utilized in one's daily existence.<BR>     Anyway, fun movie, and it doesn't belabor any points. It shoots right on through to the end. The acting sometimes leaves a bit to be desired, but do you watch action movies for the acting?
B00005R8DB|5.0|The title track is a perfect Monk-style masterpiece... edgy, dynamic, and captivating.  It's obviously a difficult song to play, but I'm glad Monk had the patience to do it.  &quot;Bolivar&quot; is a stately blues, and &quot;Pannonica&quot; is another catchy blues.  &quot;I Surrender&quot; is a Monk solo song, and the 20-bit recording sounds great.  &quot;Bemsha Swing&quot; is the liveliest of the group, with Max Roach's tympanis providing the swing.  Sonny Rollins plays sax on this, and is of course superb.
079213690X|5.0|Braveheart is a story about William Wallace (Mel Gibson) and his fight for freedom and vengeance against the 13th century, bloodthirsty king Edward the Longshanks.  After the king of Scotland dies without an heir, Edward the Longshanks, a ruthless king of England takes over the throne and oppresses and brutalizes the Scottish people in every way imaginable, even claiming the right to be the first to have sex with a newly married virgin wife of any Scottish man.  When Wallace returns to his homeland after many years, he is dismayed by the treatment of his people.  He forms a rag-tag but incredibly courageous army to fight the English and remove them from the country.  After winning a few battles, Wallace becomes the symbol of hope for his people.  <BR>This movie is filled with nearly every kind of emotion.  From the softhearted and romantic love scenes between Wallace and his wife, to the violence of the battle scenes, to the rage you will feel towards Wallace's enemies.  It's full of patriotism, betrayal, love, hate, violence, and many others.  This movie, though 3 hours long, never has a boring part in it.  It's no surprise that it won 5 Oscar Awards including Best Picture, and Best Director for Mel Gibson. <BR>Braveheart is an outstanding movie about actual historical events.  However, it is not a movie to sit down and watch with young children.  The battle scenes are very graphic and bloody.  I would also warn potential viewers to make sure you have the time to view the entire movie before starting it.  Make your popcorn, close the shades, and turn off the telephone, because you are in for a ride that you will not want interrupted.<br />Americans continue to go back to our normal \\"life as usual\\" after the 9-11 attacks, the flags have all come down, no more patriotic rallies, no more candle light prayer meetings.  Also comes all of the bickering over trivial matters such as having the word \\"God\\" on our money or not.  Maybe it's time for all of us to watch a movielike this again.  Maybe we need to be reminded of the bloodshed and sacrifice that was, and still is made for our own country.  In the movie Wallace was willing to risk it all for something he deemed more precious than life.  FREEDOM.  Americans need to be inspired to do the same and Braveheart is the movie to do it.
B000002UB3|5.0|This album is the first REAL (not counting Beatles 1, which wasn't too amazing) Beatles album I bought, and I was totally blown away... In just a few days, it has become one of my favorite albums of all time, and I would go so far as to put it among the best, such as Dark Side of the Moon, etc... Here's a breakdown of the album:<br />1)Come Together: A classic. A staple to classic rock radio, and a very good song. 5/5<br />2)Something: Another classic, and another radio favorite. Possibly Harrison's best song. 5/5<br />3)Maxwell's Silver Hammer: Very whitty, catchy tune. 5/5<br />4)Oh! Darling: A sort-of Motown vibe to it, pretty decent song. 4/5<br />5)Octopus's Garden: A catchy, yellow submarine-esque song, sung by Ringo (but written by Starsky!). 4/5<br />6) I Want You (She's so Heavy): Pretty heavy, bluesy song, perfectly done. 5/5<br />7)Here Comes the Sun: Another great Harrison Classic. 4/5<br />8)Because: My least favorite song on the album, but only because the rest is so good. This is still a good song. 4/5<br />9)You Never Give Me Your Money: The beginning of an amazing medley, and what a start!! GREAT song. 5(+)/5<br />10)Sun King: Continuing the medley, a very relaxing, peaceful song. 5/5<br />11) Mean Mr. Mustard: Medley song, good rock 'n roll tune. 5/5<br />12)Polythene Pam: More Medley, a great, and pretty hard/heavy song. 5/5<br />13)She Came in Through the Bathroom Window: Medley again, possibly my favorite tune on the album. 5(+)/5<br />14)Golden Slumbers: Medley. Very relaxing, and very well done. 5/5<br />15)Carry That Weight: Medley. Great song, very catchy. 5/5<br />16)The End: A great &quot;end&quot; to this amazing medley, with the very famous lines &quot;And in the end, the love you take, is equal to the love you make.&quot; 5/5<br />17)Her Majesty: Edited out of the medley (I guess it is supposed to go after Mean Mr. Mustard, but it doesn't QUITE fit). A very whitty little clip. 4/5<br />As you may expect, my favorite part of the album isthe medley. Of course, I think the whole album is great. In my mind (as well as many others'), this is The Beatles' best album. Hope I've helped you!
0812550706|4.0|The basic idea of Ender's Game could have easily gone wrong. It could have turned into juvenilistic wish full-filment fantasy or yet another innocent child has horrible things done to him story.<BR> But Card escapes all that by making Ender a figure that is heroic in the classical sense (i.e. unconstrainable by normal society), yet tragic in a very modern sense. He is a far from helpless child and it is his very genius that causes his tragedy.<BR>Yeah, he saves the world in the end, but it is a morally ambiguous victory at best.<BR> The style is simplistic, but that is fitting for Ender's viewpoint and the militeristic background. It grows more complex alongside Ender.
B00005JM02|5.0|I have to admit, I have two kids, ages 7 and 3, but Im buying this one for me! This movie definitely caters to them, with its  myriad of life issues, solutions, and a great amout of humor towards those issues. It touches on some of the mose sensitive subjects that face our children today, and turns the intense emotions into something a little more light-hearted.I think this film is truly adorable!  Probably the best animated childrens film I have ever seen. It ranks up there with the best of them. I like to make it a point to screen even these types of films before my kids see it. We all have seen some of the \\"crap\\" that goes into some of these so called childrens movies. When I took my kids to see it, I was the one crying and laughing out loud, not them! Its a film that will be passed on for generations. Or as long as the DVD or VHS will continue to play!

B00005YW4H|1.0|Oh c'mon now, you know this is so tired. Album should have been titled &quot;Songs for Middle-Aged Yuppies Who Think They're Hip.&quot; Throw this in the bargain bin along with Lou Bega and Eiffel 65 CDs. I &quot;don't know why&quot; this got as much attention as it has, certainly unworthy of all the Grammy wins.
1563899426|3.0|Basically, this is an okay episode of Columbo set in a world of storybook characters.  There are many witty inversions, like how one of the little pigs crashes on the wolf's sofa, or how Prince Charming is a deadbeat, but it's so self-conscious that there's always a wall between the reader and the characters.  Extremely postmodern types will probably like it more.
B00008S2VG|5.0|This is true music. I'm so tired of the he/she did me wrong songs and losing out on love. It's so boring to have to turn the radio on and hear such crap.<br />Madonna knows this and has come up with a wonderful album of true issues. I feel so enlightened listening to these songs. They are about sharing, being moved, not letting poeple tell you how to live your life, destroying your ego. Who knew that pop music could be truned into an art form. Madonna has done so with this album and others will follow.<br />So the album is not a critical or commercial success, but it is truly an artistic success in my book. Go buy it today and have fun listening to the future of music!!!
B00008EY9G|5.0|there weren't any good movies out there, I decide to watch this one and bingo!!! it turns out to be so original and worth every minute. To everyone who said they saw &quot;IT&quot; coming is probably saying that because they heard something about the movie from someone else. Believe me, this is a very cool movie, with a twist that will take you by surprise. John Cusack is VERY good, Amanda Peets is great and Ray Liota plays his usual jerk self. Great movie, great cast and a great story. I've told all my friends to watch it and everyone has said it was wonderful.
B00005JL2O|3.0|After seemingly forever, Powers fans finally have the third in the Austin Powers series - and it's sure to live up to their expectations.  Mike Myers once again returns as Austin Powers, who this time must confront an array of enemies which includes Dr. Evil (Myers), Fat Bastard (Myers), and his newest foe - Goldmember (Myers).  By his side is sexy Foxxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles) - of course, all of the original gang is back as well.  There's more spoofs and an outrageous opening sequence featuring plenty of big-name cameos; it leaves behind most of it's sex humor, however, to go for potty humor - but there's just as much laughs and entertainment as any other Austin Powers film.  Groovy, baby, yeah!
0385504209|5.0|&quot;The DaVinci Code&quot; is probably the best book I've read this year.  I'd recommend starting it on a Friday evening, so you can finish it quickly--it's really difficult to put down once you start to read it.  Dan Brown really masters the art of keeping the reader on pins and needles in this work.
140010078X|5.0|Michael Prichard's narration is flawless.  The story is gripping, laden with suspense, and still fresh despite the events in question taking place in the 18th century.  The \\"sea-going man with one leg\\" may even give you nightmares.
B0000BYM3K|2.0|Rather than repeat what others have said <BR>about this album (i.e yes, it is the best thing<BR>they have managed in years, yes the lyrics are cheesy in <BR>places) i thought I would focus on my particular<BR>issue.<br />Bluntly, I think the guitar work is lazy. I struggle to <BR>think of a track on any album up till 1986 that <BR>didn't feature any memorable riffs - both at the <BR>beginning, while bruce was singing, during the chorus and<BR>during instrumentals. On this latest effort, many tracks <BR>start off in that quiet Still Life sort of way, <BR>but without ever capturing any real mood. When the <BR>songs kick in, the chord progressions are fairly<BR>straightfoward.  <br />There is nothing really memorable in the riffs - and <BR>worse, some are even cheesy. Listening to the beginning<BR>of Montsegur, I thought it was going to be a good <BR>track. However, it soon launched into a fairly embarrassing<BR>sequence of notes.<br />It is probably unfair to compare this record to<BR>the 80's - so many of the songs are etched into my memory.<BR>And they would have to be going some to achieve the classics<BR>of the past - after all there are more ideas in say, <BR>Hallowed Be Thy Name, than there is across the <BR>whole of this album.<br />Its not all bad though - the best tracks (Rainmaker, New Frontier)sound like b-sides they could have done in the late 80's and all things considered I think that is praise indeed.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Wow, the first time that I saw &quot;Once more with feeling&quot;, an episode of my favorite serie I was astonished, I still can`t believe how they managed to create such amazing songs, and what can I say about the musical performances of the show by the whole cast, AWESOME, I live in Mexico, so I was dying about getting the album with the music of the special, it was kind o hard to get it, specially in this part of America, but now I can say that I own it, let me tell you, it is great, my favorite songs are: Going through the motions, Overture (Anyas part is hilarious), under your spell, walk through the fire, something to sing about, where do we go from here and suite from &quot;the gift&quot;. It is simply the best.
B0000028VT|5.0|This album is the good Mariah, when she climbed up the charts and was extremely successful. I love this CD and I listent to it on and on, it's never boring! If you buy it you won't be disapponited. If you're uncertain whether to buy it or not &quot;you don't know what you're missin'&quot;! This album is full of good ballads (Hero above all, Anytime You Need A Friend, absolutely one of my favorite!, Music Box, pretty nice, calm and positive , Never Forget You and Without You, plus Just To Hold You Once Again, the beautiful All I've Ever Wanted and the european bonus track Everything Fades Away), but also of fabulous uptempo tracks (the 8-weeks smash hit Dreamlover, Now That I know and I've Been Thinking About You). A gem, don't forget it! Buy it now!
6304639457|5.0|Im a 19 year-old college student and I saw &quot;The Dance&quot; for first time in April on PBS and became an instant fan that night.  I went right out and bought &quot;Tango in the Night&quot; and &quot;Rumours&quot;.  I never enjoyed classic rock until I watched this concert.  The DVD's sound quality and the performance are nearly flawless.<br />My picks of the night included &quot;Everywhere&quot;, &quot;Gypsy&quot;, &quot;Go Insane&quot; and &quot;You Make Loving Fun&quot;.  Stevie's vocals on &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; and &quot;Silver Springs&quot; are intense and give me chills every time I hear them.  Lyndsay's guitar work is spectacular (his solo on &quot;Gypsy&quot; is perfect) and Mick and John's driving pulse equally infectious.  Christine is still my favorite and even though her stage presence is somewhat lacking, she is a briliant song-writer and musician whose voice is is in top form, &quot;Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii&quot;.  <br />The new material was outstanding, with the exception of &quot;My Little Demon&quot; (I just don't get it!).  &quot;Sweet Girl&quot; and &quot;Temporary One&quot; could have been on any of the classic albums.<br />I only wish that there had been room for a few more songs.  Why wasn't &quot;Sara&quot; in the set list.  My personal requests would have been to ditch &quot;Demon&quot; and &quot;I'm so Afraid&quot; in favor of &quot;Monday Morning&quot; and &quot;Second Hand News&quot;.  It would be nice if Christine would have done &quot;Little Lies&quot; and &quot;Hold Me&quot; and Stevie could have added in &quot;Sara&quot; and &quot;Seven Wonders&quot;.  Even though their &quot;classic&quot; material is mostly associated with the seventies, it would have been nice to see their 80's pop gems get their due.  <br />This DVD showcases the band in top form; expert performers finely tuned in their craft.  The piano in &quot;Rhiannon&quot; and the banjo on &quot;Say You Love Me&quot; were perfect touches for the night.  Stevie's expressions during &quot;Landslide&quot; timeless, &quot;I'm getting older, too.....&quot; makes you realize that they are all in their fifties now.  John and Mick prove once again that that they are perhaps the premier bass line of the past quarter-century.    I suggest getting &quot;The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac&quot; and giving &quot;Say You Will&quot; a shot.  Some of the material is pretty good (listen to &quot;Steal Your Heart Away&quot;).  That being said, this DVD is a treasure you need to buy and share.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Johnny Cash died yesterday. Ironically (or perhaps not), I was watching the DVD that comes with CASH IV, his last (and in my opinion, most brilliant) achievement produced by the edgy Rick Rubin, around the time he passed on. Ever since I purchased the CD, I knew that it was really special, as cheesy as that sounds. Like other reviewers have explained, he has a gift for taking a seemingly mundane pop song, and transforming it into a deeply profound, earthy ballad. My favorite track was &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; by Depeche Mode (which I still love), which Cash had heard and stated to be &quot;a wonderful evangelical song,&quot; even though he agreed that that was probably not its original intent. But now, after watching the DVD of the music video for &quot;Hurt&quot; last night (a Nine Inch Nails piece), I'd have to put that at the top of the list. I watched it with my wife, and we both sat in affected silence for a moment or two after it finished. &quot;That's really sad,&quot; she said. But I thought it was so beautiful. We talked for a while and decided that it was, somehow, both sad and beautiful at the same time. Much like the man in black himself.
B00005JLSE|1.0|I am halfway the film and it has been painful. Obviously Fosse was a dancer so the lyrics are far from great. The tunes are repetitive and there is NO DANCING.  The roles acted by famous stars are lacking... I have seen these people act better in other movies. As you may suspect from the number of &quot;used and new&quot; of the DVDs listed here, this is a movie that had a lot of publicity that it did not deserve.
B00009TB5G|4.0|As an avid fan of the Lord of the Rings books, I must say that I was overall impressed with the Two Towers movie.  I had been warned ahead of time that it was the movie that Peter Jackson had changed the most out of all three films, so I went into it expecting some changes.  Little changes didn't bother me (like the whole thing with Pippin taking the brooch off with his mouth, as mentioned in an earlier review).  I did enjoy the beefing up of the female characters, and the fact that Jackson showed what was happening with Arwen, because I often found myself wondering about that while reading the book.  And while some of the larger changes were a little different(what's up with the whole Aragorn falling off the cliff thing?), making me wonder if I was watching the right movie, I think the changes I was most disappointed in were the changes that made the characters look bad.  For example, the fact that Faramir took them all the way to Osgiliath before he finally decided to let Frodo go.  One of the things that really impressed me in the book was how Faramir resisted the temptation of the ring almost right away, in stark contrast to his brother Boromir.  It just made him seem a little flakier.  Also, the fact that the Ents didn't decide to get involved in the war until Pippin's quick thinking.  This made Pippin look good, but made the Ents worse characters.  I understand why Peter Jackson made these changes, because both made for a more dramatic movie, and I realize he has to think of the people who haven't read the books and keep them interested as well.  It just was kind of disappointing to see those characters portrayed in that way. The only other thing that I had to chuckle over was the battle of Helm's Deep.  It is a battle that takes up one chapter in the book, and it took up at least 45 minutes of the movie.  It was excellently done...just plan on being in the theater for five hours for The Return of the King!  With all that still needs to happen from The Two Towers that was left out, we'll be there a while!<BR>I think it's easy to find fault with any movie converted from a book, because a book can include more detail.  And let's face it:  if you've grown up reading a story, and have loved it for many years, it's always a little disappointing to have it change in a movie.  I think, though, that we need to imagine what an overwhelming task it must be to convert a well-known book trilogy to three movies.  There is no way that everyone will be happy.  Also, I think that Peter Jackson has done a great job at paying attention to detail that many other directors may have overlooked.  Overall, I think he did a great job.  I enjoyed the Two Towers, and I'm looking forward to seeing the extra footage in the extended edition!
0953104907|4.0|for any budding luthier. But what you really want to do after you get this book is buy Dan Erlewine's video from Stewart-McDonald on how to build a solid body electric guitar. It's more comprehensive. Erlewine's video actually shows contruction being done, thus making the construction of a first homemade axe that much easier. This book will help you immensly, but in a more refined way. If your looking to make an electric guitar for the first time, don't start here. Start with Erlewine's video and get this book to complement it, so to speak. This is good toilet reading, though. Toilet reading as in it's good to leave in the bathroom to read multiple times to allow all the knowledge to soak in.
B00007LTIL|5.0|Jerry Garcia and the boys produced their best work when they really sought to get back to the roots of all that is American about music. The bluegrass influence in this album, which is really what Garcia desired to do in all the Dead's music, is strong and truly makes the album. The Dead were never really known for their vocals, it was more about the music. But this album has some great vocals. American Beauty finds the Grateful Dead running on all cylinders. My favorite tracks are the Dead standard Friend of the Devil as well as the rollicking Truckin'. If you want to get into a group that really personifies the spirit of American music, start with this album and get into the Grateful Dead.
B00009V7P8|5.0|I downloaded Volcano, then Amie (yes I deleted these files immediately and don't share any folders for you RIAA police), then I read the reviews here and I RAN to the store to BUY this CD.  <br />I took it home and sat and listened and listened and listened.  I can't get enough.  The most brilliant work I've heard in a very long time.  Coldplay, Dixie Chicks, Norah Jones, Allison Kraus, Murray Perahia are among some of my recent favorites and this guy just topped that list.  <br />Finally a CD who's 18 dollar price tag made me feel I got a bargin.

B0000AFQS0|5.0|I am so glad to see this movie finally rereleased on DVD.  This is the original documentary how it was meant to be seen.  From the early performance of My Generation on The Smothers Brothers'  TV Show (in wich Keith blows up his drumset and Pete smashes Tommy Smother's guitar) to the magnificent finale of Won't Get Fooled Again (wich was the last time they ever played with Moonie) this movie leaves all of it's viewers with their jaws flat on the floor.<BR>One of the best features this new DVD has going for it is that we finally get the full-length performance of A Quick One While He's Away on The Rolling Stone's Rock 'n' Roll Circus, (the previous DVD edited four minutes off of it and took out Keith Richards introduction and a short interview clip of Pete describing how the Mini-opera came to be) wich has been regarded as the best show of The Who's career.<BR>The interviews in this documentary are great, the bands extrovert personalities are displayed perfectly.<BR>Pete Townshend gives various indepth descriptions on his songwritings among other things, that's one of the great things about Pete, he has an accute (even anal-retentive) attention to detail that gives everyone a better idea of the what goes on in his mind while he's writing, playing, and so on.  Pete has an incredible stage presence, he's never still, he's jumping and running around, smashing his guitar, put all this over his raging feedback and ear-popping power chords and you have a formula that can't be beat.  Pete is like a modern day Da Vinci or Edison, like them, his groundbreaking creations have changed the world and will always challenge and inspire future artists, but his most amazing creations are the ones that never came to be (the Lifehouse Project, better known as Who's Next).<BR>Roger Daltrey has got to be the best Rock 'n' Roll singer of all time, I don't see how someone can scream like that without their vocal chords shredding to pieces.  He was truly the face of Rock in the Seventies, Jagger and Plant should be jealous.<BR>John Entwistle's flawless musicianship is what makes the Who's music more than just noise, he holds down the beat and allows the other members to shine.  Onstage, he stands perfectly still, gazing down at the audience like a gargoyle.  He is certainly the prototype to wich all other bass players originate from.<BR>But as always, Keith Moon steals the show with his hilarious personality (the little chat with Ringo Starr), and most of all his incredible drumming (every single performance he ever gave).  It's not often when a drummer get's the same star status as a frontman, especially when you're in a group like The Who, but Keith is the first to ever really draw your gaze away from the Singer or the Guitarist and onto the back of the stage.<BR>The picture and sound on this new release are fabulous, the collectible booklet is an interesting read, and the special features are as good as the movie, and that doesn't happen too much.  A new interview with Roger, it's cool to see him reflect on things now.  There is a video and audio comparison so you can see just how much better this new remaster is.  But without a doubt, the coolest new feature is a 100 minute, multi camera angle, featurette, we get to focus on each individual member, it's alot of fun.<BR>This is what every Who fan has been waiting for, don't think twice and get this DVD, you certainly won't regret it.
0517548232|5.0|In fact, I think most economists need to read Hazlitt's classic too. And if they've already read it...they should read it again, because I think quite a few of them need to be reminded of some simple truths.<br />I am a graduate economics student and I have trudged through extremely technical economic literature in my time. Most leading economists these days become hyperspecialized and esoteric in some paltry technical issue to the point where their work is practically useless to the average person. This is a very terrible thing. Because knowledge of economics is so crucially important to our understanding of human behavior and the world, I think it *should* be accessible to more people. For this reason, I am always on the lookout for books that help people understand economics easily. That way, we can have a much better world.<br />I have found few books better for the beginner than _Economics in One Lesson_. Henry Hazlitt's book here is very highly regarded and for good reason: it's an excellent, simple look at economic issues that teaches an important lesson. That lesson? That good economics entails looking at the long-term effects of economic policies on *everyone*, rather than the short-term effects on one group. With this, we can see that when the government intervenes in the economy, there are always consequences that not immediately evident.<br />Although the book was originally published in 1946, the topics covered by Hazlitt are pertinent and explore issues that still confront us more than 50 years later. Topics include inflation, tariffs, taxation, price fixing, labor unions, savings, the importance of profits, rent control, and more. Hazlitt writes well and doesn't obfuscate the truths of matters with cumbersome graphs and math.<br />Please ignore James McDuffie's fatuous review. Most of the \\"implicit assumptions\\" Hazlitt makes are unassailable facts of reality established a priori. (Except for the assumption that government can be the *only* provider of some services, like roads, \\"health officers,\\" police, etc.) Also, mathematics is all but useless in economics. The Keynesian paradigm no longer deserves any serious attention since it has been so thoroughly refuted a hundred thousand times over. Inflation as being beneficial to the economy is a fallacy that is easily destroyed by someone with a basic knowledge of money & credit theory. Alan Greenspan a free market proponent? That's ridiculous -- he definitely was 40 years ago but he has since become anathema to the economic prosperity. In fact he's probably the most destructive Federal Reserve Chairman in history.<br />Pick up this book and Gene Callahan's _Economics for Real People_ and you'll probably have a better economic education than you will find with any undergraduate degree in neoclassical economics. I'm serious.some services, like roads, \\"health officers,\\" police, etc.) Also, mathematics is all but useless in economics.

B00006L7XQ|5.0|Johnny Cash continues to show that art and talent sometimes come together despite a hard life.  So he gave free concerts (even 40 years ago!) to convicts; it just shows he recognizes their humanity and that many of them lived hard lives that put them in bad spots in life.  He inspired many lives, both at the top and the bottom, and proved that one can rise from the depths back to sunlight.  He's eschewed drugs and addiction for many years now, so he's an example of hope.  Don't just look for the bad; also look for the good.<br />Cash was a fantastic talent and a fine performer and a good man.  He will be missed by many.
B00008NRLX|5.0|Whenever I hear lead singer Gary Louis in an interview, he mentions how he wishes the band could &quot;break through&quot; and be recognized for the greatness that it is.  He was on NPR a couple of times after this album came out, and there was more than a twinge of desperation in his voice.  What I hopes he understands, though, is that the ones that have discovered the Jayhawks quickly put their albums at the top of their favorites pile.  Their music is so accomplished, so accessible, and always above and beyond what you hear on the radio.  The same is true for Rainy Day Music. <br />I suppose this album is a return to roots in a way.  It skirts the production of their album Smile (which I still love, despite many fans' aversion to it), and soothes you, rocks you, and moves you with classic guitar melodies and thoughtful lyrics.  It's obvious who the band's country rock and folk idols are because you can hear it in the music, but they truly make it their own.  What's great about these songs is that they are so deceptively simple, but after three or four listens you notice so many brilliant things.  Subtle instruments, breathtaking arrangements literally transport you...try to listen to the song Tampa to Tulsa without seeing yourself on the bus on a dusty highway, playing cards with a neighbor in a stetson hat, as thoughts of your loved one back home run through your head.  The Jayhawks make magical, addicting music, and deserved to be recognized much more than they have been.
0553573403|5.0|Ever since Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings was published, the epic high fantasy trilogy has been virtually unbeatable as far as sales within the inappropriately combined Fantasy and Science Fiction genre. Nearly fifty years after Tolkien, the fantasy trilogy has grown into a loutish beast, producing massive never-ending fantastical soap operas that mix sex, magic, and monsters, with a dollop of that special ingredient that makes them unavoidable to adolescent boys and adults willing to relive there youth at the sacrifice of good solid writing. Now, with the \\"Rings\\" as blockbuster movies, and J.K. Rowling as the richest women in Britain, we get a sense that these - never quite 'out' - compendiums are coming back. George R. R. Martin begins his projected six book 'A Song of Ice and Fire' series with the eight hundred page A Game of Thrones. And while this outing doesn't have all the sub-textual brilliance of Tolkien, and does have all those little teenager asides, it stands amongst its peers as a giant. Always captivating, and always verging on breathtaking suspense, 'Game' is more a massive family drama than anything else.<br />The Starks of Winterfell guard the lands to the North. And up in the North, strange things are sneaking down. Meanwhile, the King and his despicable wife are having troubles. Thus the table is set for a feud over rule - a game of thrones - that encompasses several generations of seven massive families and hundreds of extra characters. The only thing more magnificent than the scope is the deft way in which Martin is able to make sense of it all. Each chapter is told from the point of view of a particular character; a device that works excellently  in describing multiple points of view as well as in doling out suspense. One chapter may end in a sort of mini-cliffhanger that isn't then resolved until that character's next chapter comes up in the batting lineup. The writing is superb with the only exception being a somewhat late-night sex romp description of everything 'between the sheets' and the often cacophonous anachronisms used to give the characters a period feel. However, once involved in the story, with all those psuedo lit books that are storming the market fresh out of one's mind, there is no doubt that one will enjoy this book, and want to continue with the others.cription of everything 'between the sheets' and the often cacophonous anachronisms used to give the characters a period feel.

B0000BYM3K|1.0|More overblown, pseudo-cerebral garbage from the Sergeant Major, with those terribly repetitive choruses. That's how you know it's a Steve Harris song: by how the chorus repeats several useless times. And it's even Co-produced by none other than Steve Harris! Hey, when is Steve going to start doing the cover art as well? HIS band can sure use help in that department, as the cover art has been getting worse and worse as time goes on. Unfortunately, there are still a whole lot of sheep out there that'll trick themselves into thinking this is great stuff; that have been so brainwashed by the gimmicks and hype that anything put in front of them is greedily consumed. But until something's done about that worn-out-his-welcome, spastic, prancing 3rd guitarist, I'm not going to bother with this stuff. Hey, Adrian is back now, so you can leave. I think Blaze needs a writing partner.....
B000002L5I|3.0|Trouble Is... is the followup to Kenny Wayne Shepherd's killer debut Ledbetter Heights. While the band clearly sounds tighter and Shepherd's playing continues to impress, several tracks from the album's second half are mediocre making it an uneven followup.<br /><br />The first seven tracks on this album are all top notch whether it's the blues of \\"(Long) Gone\\" and \\"Somehow, Somewhere, Someway\\", the driving rock of \\"Slow Ride\\", the boogie of \\"True Lies\\", or the excellent hit single \\"Blue On Black.\\" The versions of Jimi Hendrix's \\"I Don't Live Today\\" and Bob Dylan's \\"Everything Is Broken\\" are also excellent, with the band truly making the Dylan track their own.<br /><br />Then the album starts to drag with the bluesy \\"King's Highway\\" and the closing instrumental title track being the only decent tracks. The remaining tracks \\"I Found Love (When I Found You)\\", \\"Nothing To Do With Love\\", and \\"Chase The Rainbow\\" are unmemorable and lack a strong hook. If you removed these tracks, you can argue that it's as strong as Ledbetter Heights. Still it's worth checking out for tracks 1-7.

Growing up listening to the Dead Kennedy's, Reagan Youth, the Misfits, the Exploited, and a lot of bands mentioned on this album I felt a great distance over punk music in the last 10 or so years. Ever since the grunge movement (formal known as alternative music) I saw punk music get the pop music treatment, it lost its edge. It was sucked into the mainstream vacuum and the angst got filtered out into a clean, parent friendly genre. But there were bands out there still keeping the scene real. And NOFX stands out to me. I was never a fan of the \\"juvenile\\" punk music, silly and gearing more to the adolescent audience, and I always felt that this was the direction punk was heading.  I picked it up thinking I may resell it soon. First listen, YES!!, ah, dissent, dark humor, the mention of authors and great bands, I wanted to take this to every little Good Charlotte and Avril Laveign (sorry for the spelling) fan and tell them that THIS is punk music, in every shape and form. From start to finish I was very happy with the album. The first four songs is what did it for me, very political and a breath of fresh air in a fearful to speak out time in American history. When TV, radio, movies and news got scared that criticizing the current president would make them seem un-American, it is essential to artist everywhere to fill that void with a voice. NOFX speaks their mind and is not afraid on what people may think. Heck they even mention Michael Moore and that alone can brand you as an unpatriotic, Saddam sympathizer. The fifth song \\"Nubs\\" is a perfect example of the juvenile punk I mentioned earlier, but it's darn catchy and after a few listens I could not help to feel happy for this girl with no limbs that is more real than most people in this country. The rest of the album... well, most other reviews kind of cover that, I'll just say it may not have hit me like a brick like the first four songs but they are very good, covering lots of styles of punk, as the whole album does, and singing about such things as a punk community, anarchy camp, old punk days (like reading my journal back in '88) and of course a drug overdose. So if you are like me and feel that punk has become a mainstream joke or perhaps, dare I say, dead. Then get this, it will give you a sense of hope for the music we grew up loving and our parents and teachers hating.like the first four songs but they are very good, covering lots of styles of punk, as the whole album does, and singing about such things as a punk community, anarchy camp, old punk days (like reading my journal back in '88) and of course a drug overdose.

0064407667|1.0|This is proboably the worst book I've ever read.  It seems that most of it was written by an eight year old, or even younger then that.  Sometimes it seems like it's some sort of kids TV show.  The writing is highly unprofessional, especially when the author keeps saying things simular to, \\" The rest of this story is so very sad.  Do not read past this page.\\"  Also, the clulessness of the kids' older friend (forgot his name) drives you crazy!  <BR>And as for the ending, wow.  It's like an ending to any old cartoon, tricky, but not any good. This whole book can be made into a 30 minute cartoon.
0784010501|5.0|This was a terrific film, an informative and enjoyable look at Madonna on tour, behind the scenes.  The concerts she performed required a lot of work, management and coordination, and it was fascinating to see parts of the process.<br />A lot of people castigate Madonna for her lifestyle, but we all need to keep a few things in mind:  No law requires people to buy concert tickets or CDs from Madonna, but that's certainly not the case for public school districts, which merely arrange to tax citizens for whatever they want.  There are no laws prohibiting anyone from competing with Madonna, but that's certainly not the case for our magnificent U.S. Postal Service.  Madonna will always be funding her own retirement and health benefits programs -- but that's certainly not the case for our Senators/Representatives in Washington, who have bestowed lavish benefits upon themselves with money simply confiscated from taxpayers.<br />Madonna is a fine artist, along with being a successful free-market capitalist competitor.  She has built a fortune for herself by pleasing others, and not causing any problems for anyone else.  The truth is, all of us should dare to emulate the personal passion whish has fueled her success.
B00008S2VG|5.0|&quot;American Life&quot; is an awesome CD. If you are a Madonna fan then this is a must have CD. Even if you are not a Madonna fan, it is garanteed you will love this CD. This is truly one of her best CDs. If you liked her &quot;Ray of Light&quot; CD, then you will like this one too!! Go buy it right now!!
0142004235|4.0|I hadn't read this book in years and years, so I just picked it up again recently.  I have to admit, I didn't enjoy it as much the second time around.  And it is not as good as &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; or &quot;Of Mice and Men.&quot;  Still, even though it is not Steinbeck's best, it is better than most books I have read in my life (were this by any other author, it probably would have gotten five stars).  I thought the story was captivating, and I didn't want to stop reading.  I just loved the characters, even though they are a bit one-dimensional.  The book often alludes to the Bible, but don't worry about missing the hidden themes, Steinbeck lays them all out in the open.  If I have one major complaint, it would be that the ending lacked drama.  Other than that, this is Steinbeck at his near best.
B00000490M|5.0|This is an excellent film.  I think this has an excellent plot.  In John G. Avildsen's The Karate Kid Daniel and his mother move from New Jersey to Southern California, where he's not too keen about his new home until he meets Ali and attractive girl who seems to like him.  But trouble looms when Ali's ex-boyfriend and his gang of ruffians start tormenting Daniel.  One day, as Daniel is suffering a beating at the hands of these louts, Mr. Miyagi an elderly Japanese handyman, comes to his rescue.  To Daniel's amazement, Miyagi manages to take down the whole group by himself using karate.  Daniel begs to learn this ancient martial art, and soon Miyagi begins the boy's training, teaching Daniel that there is more to karate than fighting.  Through a series of lessons, the wise mentor instills a sense of honor and nobilty in his young pupil while preparing him for the ultimate karate showdown.  However, as  Daniel studies the discipline  and art of karate, his enemies are learning a dirtier kind of fighting from Kreese a cold-blooded ex-marine.  Ultimately, the boys will fight to the finish in the All Valley Karate Championship in a rousing and triumphant finale.  Morita is a gem, as the elderly father figure Miyagi, giving the character warthm, wisdom, and comic charm.  macchio's underdog character inspired an entire generation to run out and join the nearest karate school while chanting &quot;wax on, wax off&quot;.
1577311523|5.0|Learning to live in the present moment isn't as easy as it initially sounded to me.  It is easy to learn all sorts of concepts and ideas.  But, actually LIVING in this way has become the challenge of my life.  I loved The Power of Now, but got so wrapped up in the concepts that I lost track of the difference between just thinking I was being present and actually being present.  Like so many others, I convinced myself that I was something that I wasn't - so clearly I was not being present to the reality of myself.  Then I was loaned \\"Present Moment Awareness\\" (Shannon Duncan).  This was a major turning point in my personal growth path.  When I read this book, and practiced a bit on what he was teaching, I began to see the ways in which I wasn't being present and why, so that being genuinely present in this moment became more natural for me.   By studying and practicing what was taught in \\"Present Moment Awareness\\", Eckharts teachings really started to sink in for me.<br />These two books work REALLY well together.  Read Present Moment Awareness first, and then read (or re-read) The Power of Now.
B000056QE5|5.0|MARY POPPINS has always been one of my favorite movies. However, I never fully appreciated the high quality of the score until I heard the soundtrack CD. Every song contributes to the story yet is memorable in its own right. The recorded sound itself is crisp and full, showing its age (it was made in 1964) hardly at all. No wonder the album was so popular when it was first released.<BR>Julie Andrews as Mary is in her absolute vocal prime, with a pristine, warm sound and that trademark clarity of diction. As Bert, Dick van Dyke's \\"Cockney\\" accent has often been criticized as artificial-sounding; however, no one could deny that his is a fun and warm-hearted performance. David Tomlinson as the stern Mr. Banks (who finally learns to \\"lighten up\\") is totally convincing, singing excellently. Of the smaller roles, Ed Wynn, with his famous infectious giggle, is a delight as Uncle Albert in \\"I Love to Laugh,\\" a wonderful song that will lift your spirits high. The combination of fine songs, fine singing, and colorful sound makes the MARY POPPINS soundtrack CD a must-have for fans of the movie. You'll find yourself playing it again and again.
0962477060|5.0|If your attempts at learning the guitar have been frustrating and you always thought, \\"there has to be a better way,\\" then this is your book. Most books treat the guitar like it's no different than a keyboard...and never unlock the basic secret every guitarist must understand: the brilliant organization behind the guitar's tuning. Bill Edwards changes all of that. He shows it doesn't have to be that hard to understand the guitar. Fretboard Logic doesn't try to teach standard music theory, per se. You can learn that anywhere (and you should). Instead, it teaches you how to use that theory and apply it to the guitar and its unique tuning. It's not the \\"only\\" guitar or music book you'll ever need. It's just the most important! And yes, you will still have to practice. But it's a lot easier when you can see what you're doing, rather than just using what the author calls the \\"bootstrap\\" method (rote memorization of scales & chords) or the \\"academic\\" method (trying to understand the guitar using basic building blocks of music theory without ever seeing the \\"big picture\\"). I can't recommend it highly enough.
0066620996|4.0|A very good book.  Collings and his group use extensive research of publicly traded companies whose stock has outperformed the market for 15 years after some period of mediocre stock performance.  These companies are compared to other companies in similar industries and similar financial characteristics at the beginning of the period when the great companies began their climb.<br />I really enjoyed reading this book and I'm impressed by all the research data provided in the appendices.  Rather than get one CEO's opinion, the information is backed up by data from multiple industries with data from other companies that are not great.  <br />Strong company performance is correlated with several factors that were surprising, including a humble CEO who takes blame but not credit, promotion of CEOs from within, and a focus on what you can do best, even if it's not something you are doing now.<br />The only caveat I have is that correlation does not imply causality.  The book cites several factors (Level 5 leadership, hedgehog concept, etc.) that are correlated with greatness.  These factors may be the cause of greatness, or both greatness and these factors may be the result of some other cause.  Additional research is needed before the factors cited can indeed be demonstrated to cause greatness.
6304196938|4.0|Cary Grant did well in Hitchcock's thrillers as his usual suave self, that playing himself to perfection.  North By Northwest makes Grant's fourth and last Hitchcock film, the others being Suspicion, Notorious, and To Catch A Thief.  In this one, he plays Roger Thornhill, who early in the film is mistaken by some sinister men for a certain George Caplan, a double agent.  He is unexpectedly hijacked and taken to a manor house, and interrogated by two men, a Mr. Townsend (James Mason) and his assistant Leonard (Martin Landau).<br />Before long, Thornhill is falsely accused of murdering a UN official and goes on the lam.  Fortunately, he gains an ally in Eve Kendall (Eve Marie Saint), a slender, sophisticated-looking blonde, who conceals him aboard a train, and all because he has a nice face.  However, she seems to be playing more than just one side, as he discovers later.  Things build to a point when Thornhill says, &quot;I'm an advertising man. ... I've got a job, a secretary, a mother, two ex-wives, and several bartenders dependent upon me, and I don't want to disappoint them all by getting slightly killed.&quot;<br />The U.S. Intelligence Agency is aware of Thornhill's innocence, but decides to use him as a decoy to protect their double agent, now infiltrating Van Dam, the villain of this movie.<br />There are lots of innuendos in this film that are pretty risque for 1959.  Eve tells Roger, &quot;I'm a big girl.&quot;  He says, &quot;And in all the right places too.&quot;  In fact the seduction scene in Eve's sleeping car is steamy for the era, but the Hays Code rears it head at the last moment when at the mention of one bed, she makes it clear Thornhill will sleep on the floor.  However, Hitchcock uses Freudian dream symbolism to thumb his nose at the Hays Code when in one scene, he has a train going into a tunnel.  Figure that one out!<br />The suspense element involving Thornhill escaping one situation after another, having a brief pause, only to have to hide or face some new danger keeps this film going.  And the climactic scene at Mount Rushmore is a classic, as is that now-famous scene that innocuously begins when a man waiting at the same bus stop as Thornhill remarks &quot;that plane is dusting crops where there ain't no crops.&quot;  Hold on to your hats!  Oh, and the auction scene is both humorous but clever, once one realizes the motive for Thornhill's actions.<br />One funny scene involves a familiar portly older man missing the bus after the opening credits.  Guess who that is?  And Thornhill's lie to Eve on why the police are chasing him:  &quot;Seven parking tickets.&quot;  However, I've observed some ridiculous things.  One, the best way to conceal yourslf if you're a wanted murder is to wear dark glasses.  Uh-huh, right!  Another is, if the person you're talking to suddenly gets killed by a thrown knife, don't touch the knife--you'll be blamed for the murder.<br />Other assets here include Bernard Herrman's music score.  I wonder if Phillip Glass got some inspiration here for Koyaanisqatsi, as some of the frantic violins in NbNW echo that over movie.  Herrman's score at the beginning has echoes of Stravinsky, matching the drawn grid patterns that gradually turn to the glass windows of a New York skyscraper.

B0000524CY|3.0|This is a 5 star movie, but the issue here is the added scenes. I was curious, being a fan of the original, but I can't help but feel the original cuts were justified. Especially so when it involved the extra flashing of the demon's face. More dicy is the flashing of Father Merrin's face at the window before Karras jumps, which adds a spritual clarity where ambiguity has long been the established tone for the film. To some extent, the additions are good for seeing the director's intentions, sort of like place markers, but the original cuts were wise and obviously considered since it impacted the tone of the move, thus adding an understated power to a very disturbing and scary movie.

B00004XONN|5.0|Obviously, the reviewers cited on this page have no sense of what interesting and 'engaging' music is.  Radiohead's music in general and Kid A in particular is some of the most interesting music written.  The band's blend of traditional musical aspects and electronica is bold and unique.  As a classically trained musician myself, I appreciate the band's soulful harmonies, changing rhythms and meter, and genuine lyrics.  Radiohead is a jewel among so many watered-down and similar sounding bands!
B000089RVX|3.0|I have to agree with one reviewer, it's good music for a few listens, but short on being original, &quot;on coat-tail of Lacuna Coil&quot;, a band more talented with more nuance to discover and appreciate each and every time. Amy's voice is clear and powerful, but I have to agree with another reviewer, she &quot;emotes on every note&quot; which sounds fairly banal after a while. The video appears &quot;over-polished&quot;, &quot;pseudo-goth&quot;, here I have to agree again... In short, an album much like my review, saying what has been previously said, possibly less well, with some degree of truth in it, but not quite inspiring. I give it 3 stars for the one-night's worth of enjoyment it gave me. Not likely I'll listen to this album again and again, like some other real great music... I guess my review also deserves a lackluster agree/no-agree ratio, that's also fair.
B00005JLXE|1.0|Please don't watch this movie! Most films have good parts, but this film does NOT. I could see this movie doing ok if it were a student film, but this was large scale. This movie fits right in with the cheesiness of The Hulk.
B000026FOA|5.0|I learned of Drake in the early seventies while a student in the UK. I bought this title on vinyl; I didn't like it. My taste ranged from Hendrix to Bowie to pre-68 Dylan. But I also liked Fairport and the Incredible String Band. I still love all of this music. Sometime after Drake died, I heard Five Leaves Left again while visiting a good friend. I had great respect for my friend's oblique taste in art, literature and music and resolved to listen again. I went home and just played this as I worked around the apartment. Soon thereafter, I \\"got\\" it. Like most others who have reviewed this, I love virtually all of Drake's work though this one may be my favorite. Drake's songs have remained my absolute favorites as I have journeyed through the times. I loved and love the English punk bands, Patti Smith, Television and Tom Verlaine, Talking Heads, the Pixies, Nirvana, the Finn brothers' stuff, XTC, Jack Johnson as well as Outcast, the Roots and Steve Earle. NOTHING does it like Nick Drake. NOTHING.
B000069HJL|5.0|This double concert album almost runs in my blood: listening to it is reviving some great high school times! On a less personal level, every minute of it is impeccably performed and perfectly recorded, turning it into one of a handful of particularly powerful live albums: I put it up there, alongside Peter Gabriel's 'Plays Live'. To top the quality of the performance and the recording, every single song in it is a Supertramp classic in itself, with &quot;Fool's Overture&quot; being the one that benefits the most from the live performance. This is a must for all rock fans, and if you are new to Supertramp, this along with &quot;Even in the quietest moments&quot; will give you a heavy dose of what this band is capable of.
0345457684|5.0|I was the long Labor Day weekend and I was looking for something fun, escapist, and relaxing to read. Richard K. Morgan's \\"Altered Carbon\\" was all that plus intellectually interesting and, at moments, philosophically intriguing - questioning the limits and prerogatives of what it is that makes anyone human, one human a human, and one human that particular human. If that all sounds jolting, well then, read on a bit.<br />It is the 25th century, and our protagonist Takeshi Kovacs is quite a specimen of a Special Ops guy. Having been born 186 light years away on Harlan's World (which was populated by Japanese keiretsu with Eastern European labor in the distant 23rd century) and graduated from street gangs to the armed forces, Takeshi eventually finds his way into the UN Envoys and is now brought to Earth for the first time to solve a very unique murder mystery. There he is trained for the life in which he exists, essentially, as a consciousness (all people have a cortical stack that records their memories up to the moment of death; this is convenient since the stack can then be re-inserted into a body, thus bringing the unfortunate deceased back to life) and can be zipped across the galaxy to do the Protectorate's bidding as need be.<br />Morgan takes this clever bit of futurist postulating and generates a fully formed world that comes complete with its over-exposed celebrities, clichéd ancient philosophers, world-weary stellar travelers, distant frontiers, great adventures, mind-blowing sex and illicit substances, and, above all, human foibles, follies, and fears.<br />I can't get specific without ruining plot details, so let me say that injecting one's consciousness into another, inert, human body (\\"sleeving\\"_ creates all sorts of self-identity and other-identity issues. Peculiar circumstances abound between lovers, friends, enemies, and spouses, and Morgan deals with his characters sensitively - they evince fear, optimism, and a certain willful know-nothingness about the prospects of coming and going so readily from Death's grasp.<br />In the first half of the novel, the author is so strong that the work, perhaps unintentionally, levitated above the plain of mere sci-fi or detective novels, and achieves a profound, poignant, sublime exegesis on being human. Towards the second half, he begins to pick up the pace and he slips into a more pedestrian tone and style that is more distinctly of the genres. So while this book is excellent and absolutely recommended, it does not take its place with the eternal classics.<br />Word-choice and the surprising thought and actions of these characters reveal Morgan as a particularly adept author and story-teller:<br />The composed woman is not seething with rage inside, rather: \\"The strain on her face was still there, like weathered rocks under a thin mantle of snow.\\"<br />The hotel lobby at the Hendrix is not dark and dismal, rather: \\"The walls and ceiling bore an irregular spacing of illuminum tiles whose half-life was clearly almost up, and their feeble radiance had the sole effect of shoveling the gloom into the center of the room... [populated by] shin-hungry metal-edged tables.\\"<br />This is enjoyable, thoughtful writing in which the technology, the future, and the plot serve to reveal the human condition, and are not made, awkwardly, to bear the brunt of the story and the entertainment. <br />As when the protagonist Takeshi is told:<br />\\"I'm not sure. He went to Osaka that day, for a meeting..\\"<br />\\"Osaka is where?\\"<BR>She looked at me in surprise.<br />This is just delicious, brilliant writing: that the author would remember that our Japanese-Czech protagonist wouldn't know where Osaka is, and that an Earthling would of course assume he would.<br />The plot moves along quite strongly throughout the book, and there are no exceptionally weak parts. Ultimately, the story is settled, and then unsettled, by a series of unnecessary deus ex machinas, that do distract a bit from the storyand remind the reader that this is, after all, a first-time author. Nonetheless, the detective story line is great, intriguing, gripping, and fits hand-in-glove with the technological inventions of the author's mind.<br />The philosophical touches of the book are what I loved most. Morgan details the implications of a world in which the rich can afford disposable cloned bodies and live for centuries, crime syndicates can produce multiple copies of talented assassins, the working class stiffs are resentful of the immortality beyond the reach of their wallets, death is not permanence but a phase, and one's consciousness is transportable instantaneously across the galaxy. Each of these is deftly, masterfully handled and leaves the reader pondering  accidentally deep quandaries.<br />In sum, I liked this book an awful lot, despite not being a scifi reader for over a decade now. Not only will it be loved by the detective and science fiction crowds, but by a crossover audience that likes to sample the best that other genres have to other. For 2003, Richard Morgan's Altered Carbon is that book.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|The idiot who wrote Iron Maiden is gone is no fan. Maiden has passed the test of time as one of the greatest bands of all time, but don't get the credit they deserve as does more main stream bands such as kiss. This album kicks.... Bruce's voice is still on top as is the riffs. Harris is the best bassist of all time. What a major line-up they've got. They just keep banging out the tunes. They need their own special to celebrate their contributions to metal. No band in their style has gotten such a respect as this could be. Their music is moving and puts me in such a great state of mind. If only they would grace Indiana again would I be complete again.<br />I'll leave it at this... UP THE IRONS!
6303022901|5.0|This tearjerker adaptation based on the book by Amy Tan, is about four Chinese mothers and their American born daughters, and how the distinct cultural chasm in their upbringing, play into their daily lives.<br />The flashbacks into the young lives of each mother is masterful storytelling filled with rich imagery.<br />But it is the everyday struggles of modern life with their daughters and the conflicts between them that most will easily recognize.  In this way the movie does not exclude the general viewer from identifying with their own personal relationships with their mother, spouse, or friends.<br />This is one of the best technically engineered movies I have ever seen. The way in which the lives of the characters are weaved together is nothing short of genuis, and the movie slides flawlessly from the present to the past and back to the present again<br />The story of each mother's youth  is both heartbreaking and wonderful at the same time, and with their somewhat broken english offer up an amazing amount of simple yet  profound statements and insights as they tell their story and try to impart upon their daughters wisdom gained through both suffering and sacrifice.<br />The modern day entanglements of each daughter and their often tense relationships with their moms, show us in the end that no matter who we are, or where we come from, the bond between a mother and daughter is often a complex enigma, full of conflicting emotions.<br />Throughout all this, the main underlying issue is the trip to China one of the daughters is about to embark on, to meet for the first time, two sisters previously abandoned in wartime China while at the same time paying a personal tribute to her own mother.<br />If I had to flaw the movie it would be the constant onslaught on one?s emotions right up until the very end.<br />Nevertheless, I still give it 5 stars although I am sure this movie will appeal more to women.<br />FAVORITES MOVIE QUOTES:<br />\\"..and on that day, second wife's hair began to turn white\\"<br />\\"All around me I see the signs.

B00005Q3KC|5.0|&quot;The Best of The Corrs&quot; is a definitive collection of hits from the Irish family band. Although The Corrs have only had mild success in the U.S., they have had an endless string of Number One hits and million selling albums internationally. The Corr siblings consisting of sisters Andrea, Sharon and Caroline and brother Jim display a natural talent and an incredible gift for upbeat melodic songwriting. The band's Irish roots come across as well especially in Sharon's violin playing.<br />&quot;The Best of The Corrs&quot; includes 16 of The Corrs biggest hits including their first smash &quot;Runaway&quot;, their two U.S. chart hits &quot;So Young&quot; and &quot;Runaway&quot;, unplugged renditions of &quot;Radio&quot; and R.E.M.'s &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot; plus an additional three new tracks, &quot;Make You Mine&quot;, &quot;Lifting Me&quot; and the peppy &quot;Would You Be Happier?&quot;<br />This CD is an excellent introduction to The Corrs music. Unfortunately, &quot;The Best of The Corrs&quot; has yet to receive a U.S. release and is only available as an import. The good news is that it's worth every penny. The Corrs are an extraordinary pop group with some very positive music. Take one listen to this CD and it'll brighten your entire day.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead has a way of combining all their previous works while adding something absolutely new and original to it at the same time, and this is no exception. Start to finish this album is a masterpiece. The best way I can describe it is Amnesiac with a bit of OK Computer and The Bends blended in. It's incredible. You can't just listen to it once! And just when you thought Thom's voice couldn't get anymore amazing, he somehow manages to pull of his best vocals to date. If you love Radiohead, whether it be OK Computer, Kid A, or The Bends, then this is a must have. If you are just starting to listen to Radiohead, this is a great starting point to hear exactly what they're caipable of.
B000077VR3|5.0|&quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; is like no other film you have seen before. It begins in 1900, with a man named Christian(Ewan Mcgregor) in a dark room, sitting at his typewriter. He sits in silence, and then begins to type. He begins to write his story. He begins to write of the Moulin Rouge.<BR>  The movie tells of how he came to Paris in the summer of 1899, eager to be a part of the Bohemian revolution and follow the loose guidlines of freedom, beauty, truth and above all things, love. He is quickly befriended by a friendly bunch of bohemians, lead by Toulouse Lautrec. The group convinces him to write their new play, &quot;Spectacular, Spectacular&quot; since their previous writer disagreed with his ideas and left. Christian is at first a little uneasy about his new job as the play's writer, but once they get him hooked on the toxic drink &quot;absinthe&quot;, everything gets a little crazy.<BR>  The bohemians bring Christian to the local, wonderous night club called, &quot;The Moulin Rouge&quot;. It's full of bright and beautiful scenery, ground-breaking music (as I'm sure you've heard, this movie has versions of modern music, from The Beatles to Kiss to Elton John), and amazing dancers. There, he meets Satine (Nicole Kidman), the main dancer and courtesan. Although they get off to a confusing start, the two soon fall madly in love.<BR>  But, all is not well in their passionate, musical world. The Duke, who is Satine's only shot of being a &quot;real&quot; actress instead of just a dancer, wants her only to himself. She IS, a courtesan, after all. <BR>  I won't give away what happens at the end (even though you probably guessed who she really loves). I WILL, however, tell you that what makes this movie so special, is just the whole effect of it all. The songs are GREAT because even though the words are familiar, the tunes and way they're put together aren't. There are at least 10 bits of different songs all as one in the song, &quot;Elephant Love Medley&quot;. Also, it's a fantasy movie in some ways. During Christian's version of Elton John's &quot;Your Song&quot;, he grabs Satine's hand quite unexpectantly, pulls her out the window, and they dance on a cloud while he sings to her. This movie is fast-paced and quite a ride! One minute you're laughing at Nicole Kidman's subtle comedic performance, the next you're being dazzled at the great songs and visuals, and the next you're holding your breath as Satine begins coughing horribly, as she does many times during the movie, but nobody knows why yet (Don't worry, that wasn't a spoiler. They mention it at the very beginning of the movie).<BR>  I'm afraid my review just can't capture the magic of &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;. It's so frantically paced (not in an annoying way) through most of it, that I usually notice something new, whether it's an image or even a piece of dialouge. You should rent this movie TODAY! It's abolutely wonderful!
B00008H2LB|4.0|Okay it may not be Hybrid Theory, (which was perfection personified), but its still a kickass CD.<br />Don't Stay - A Good song, not the best, but still fast, hard and heavy, with a really catchy bridge, 8/10<br />Somewhere I Belong - OMG! That Intro is fantastic! how does Brad do it? a magnificent song to boot and the rapping and screaming really fit well together 9/10<br />Lying from you - It's not a bad song, but its not the strongest on the album, 7/10<br />Hit the floor - A good song, but unlike somewhere, the rapping and screaming don't fit in, 7/10<br />Easier to Run - When i heard this i was just blown away, a brilliant song, one of the highlights, pure genius, 9/10<br />Faint - they took a risk with faint, the gap between releasing faint and numb was pretty big, if faint was a flop, then their career would have been difficult to revive, but fortunatley this song is absolutely fantastic, best they've ever done, 11/10<br />Figure .09 - A decent enough track but not outstanding in any way - 8/10<br />Breaking The Habit - Wow, a really fresh and original song, another highlight of the album - 9/10<br />From the inside - Another good song, 8/10<br />Nobodys listening - A song going back to their hip-hop roots of the hybrid theory ep days, i'm not a fan of hip hop, but i'm sure a hip-hop fan would like it, so it gets, 8/10<br />Session - It's not cure for the itch, 7/10<br />Numb - A briliant song, stroke of genius, it's a faint rival, really sensetive and &quot;touching&quot;, as the piano implies, yet hard and metally at the same time, a triupmh for music, 10.5/10
1400031354|5.0|In Alexander McCall Smith's second book in the series of the exploits of Mma Ramotswe the only &quot;Lady Detective&quot; in Botswana, he again delights us with Mma R's simple but elegant solutions to her detective work.  Each of her adventures are well illustrated and wonderfully narrated.  And yet, Smith gives us more in this book than in his first with respect to the cultural elements of Botswanian society.<br />He clearly points out the traditional Botswanian approach to life versus the modern day approach.  The loss of certain values within the society are elucidated.  And the reaction of those who still hold to more traditional values is described.<br />And yet, once again, Smith paints a truly wonderful and revealing picture of a proud country, that sees itself on the leading edge of Democracy in the African continent.  The book is extremely fine in its genre and a recommended read of all observers of human behavior.
B00008DDSC|4.0|The most important reason to see this movie is to watch Maggie Gylenhaal.  This performance is the reason the word \\"incandescent\\" exists.  She makes herself totally believable and VULNERABLE throughout.  It is a brave performance.<br />It's great to see James Spader back in a worthwhile role again.  He's always been an interesting, quirky, charismatic performer. <br />Spader plays an attorney (who never has any clients, apparently!) who appears to be very shy and socially backward.  He hires Gylenhaal, also shy and socially backward, to be his secretary.  Their relationship slowly turns into one of S&M.  Maggie is the recipient of the humiliations, which she enjoys.  <br />The movie tracks their VERY odd, but oddly touching relationship.  It isn't really a movie about S&M so much as a movie about how two seemingly hopeless individuals can find \\"true love.\\"  In many ways, it is a sweet movie.<br />An explicit sweet movie, however.  Gylenhaal's character becomes more and more open about her sexuality as the movie progresses, and it becomes more and more explicit.  It's not porn, but it sure isn't for the kids either.<br />This is not a movie for everyone, but if you are in the mood for something adult, different and brilliantly acted, SECRETARY may be your cup of tea.  The movie does move along at a languid pace, and it takes awhile to begin to gel around its themes, but the payoff is worth it.
B00006F7IM|2.0|The movie, a fictitious baseball story based on the real-life Cleveland Indians baseball team, is a little outdated.<br />When it was made in 1989, the Cleveland Indians, playing their home baseball games in a cavernous football stadium that had the capacity to house many fans but drew so few of them, were probably the epitome of baseball mediocrity and a very likely choice for a movie about a Cinderella-like baseball team.<br />But Chief Wahoo's followers have since gotten themselves an excellent new downtown stadium.  They've fallen on hard times again, but during the 1990's, they actually distinguished themselves as an American League powerhouse.  They came within 3 outs of winning a World Championship in 1997.<br />This movie predates that or perhaps it anticipates the rebirth of the Indians, but beyond that, there's little to be said on its behalf.<br />Take the greatest game in the world, baseball, and the greatest philosophy in the world, misogyny, and you appear to have an unbeatable combination for a movie.  But unfortunately, such is not the case here.<br />Oh yes, one can nod his head knowingly and agree that that's just what they're all like as the Indians' distaff owner (her character seems loosely based on Georgia Frontierre, owner of the Los Angeles/Anaheim/St. Louis Rams FOOTBALL team) tries to unman the dozens of hardworking baseball players who have too much pride to lose on schedule for her.<br />And there's some entertainment value in watching the lads get back at the dominatrix - defying her by continuing to win ballgames, as a photographic replica of her is stripped of clothing after each victory.<br />All that is fine, but basically the plot is so shallow that even the saving graces of baseball and misogyny can't really rescue it.<br />If you have any familiarity with baseball or sports movies, you won't be surprised by a single twist in plot that takes place during this movie - not a single one.  The plot twists have all the deceptiveness ofa hanging curve ball and are as easy to read in advance.<br />In fact, if you have a grain of intelligence, I promise you that when you watch the movie for the first time, you'll have no problem guessing exactly - I said EXACTLY - how the movie ends.  You're not SUPPOSED to be able to guess, but I guarantee that you will.  That's how little imagination was exercised by the creators.<br />And of course, the creators didn't even MEAN to make a misogynistic movie to begin with.  This was one of Rene Russo's earlier movies, in which she began to establish her typecasted reputation as one of those disgusting \\"gal pals\\" (yeah right, like a man can actually be FRIENDS with the woman that he's sleeping with!).<br />Russo, as Tom Berenger's athletic girlfriend, is supposed to counterbalance the evil presented by Margaret Whitton.<br />But Russo's dramatic presence in this film is less than what was probably intended.  Her \\"goodness\\" (assuming that one feels that a female athlete can properly represent the forces of \\"good\\") actually casts a very thin shadow on this film and doesn't at all compare to Whitton's evil.  So the movie is at least realistic in this respect.<br />This movie is also an early Charlie Sheen effort, in which he stars as the hip closing relief pitcher Rick Vaughn, the \\"Wild Thing\\".  This character would later metamorphose into real-life National League closer Mitch Williams (Cubs, Phillies), who was known for being wildly effective (usually) in a way that would terrify his own fans.<br />In this movie, Vaughn's theme song, of course, is the rock-and-roll classic \\"Wild Thing\\", but instead of using the old Trogs sound-track for this purpose, the movie-makers have some all-girl group singing instead.<br />Now, does that make any sense?  To have an all-girl group sing (as the Trogs did), \\"Wild Thing, you make my thing swing\\"?<br />No, the film-makers didn't TRY to make a misogynistic movie, but bless their hearts, they made one anyway.  It is, after all (heh-heh), the tale and not he who tells it, and commendations are in order for this accidental virtue.<br />James Gammons's reassuring masculine presence as the embattled Indians manager is another saving grace, and trivia buffs will also be interested in the presence of a younger Wesley Snipes.<br />Baseball!  Misogyny!  Familiar faces!  And yet the movie STILL doesn't satisfy.  I'll probably never find out if the sequel was an improvement.
B000002LRX|5.0|This is my favorite album of theirs.  It's just freagin' awesome.  GET IT NOW AND EXPOSE YOURSELF TO SOME REAL MUSIC.
0553573411|3.0|Mediocre I would say.<BR>When I started the book I had quite high expectations according to what the reviewers had been saying and in all sense I hadn't been totally disappointed. The characters were well thought out and interesting but something was lacking. The whole book didn't really seem to go anywhere. It basically started off almost where it ended. I will but the next installment out of curiosity because the ending was interesting and left you waiting for more and books have been known to improve from book to book.
B00006HBUB|5.0|I watched this movie on TV one night because I was bored, and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this remake/spoof of the great Scooby Doo show. While kids can watch it, I think it is more directed at adults who grew up with the cartoon. Everyone seems to hate this movie, saying that it is stupid and that it has two-dimensional plot and characterization. I think one reviewer even said that you'd have to be stoned to enjoy it. Well, I enjoyed it and I certainly wasn't stoned.<BR>The movie starts out with all of the lovable characters chasing after a ghost. Of course, it is really a criminal wearing a costume who would have gotten away with it if it weren't for those meddeling kids. Then the friends get into a fight and split up, but meet up again later when they come to an island amusement park to solve a case that invloves magic spells being cast upon college students. This movie is very well cast: Sarah Michelle Geller plays Daphne, the damsel in distress; Freddy Prince Jr. is completey full of himself as Fred; and Matthew Lillard is Shaggy the beatnik. Linda Cardelini steals the show as the nerdy Velma. And of course there is Scooby Doo, animated by computer (I wonder who does the voice for him?) You may notice that the only character who is not present is the little dog Scrappy. Velma later explains that they got rid of Scrappy because he was just too annoying, but he does come back, and the way he comes back will totally crack you up. This is the most fun I've had watching a movie for a long time.
B00009V7P8|5.0|damien rice is one of the best musicians, to say the least. this cd is brilliant and his voice and chemistry with lisa hannigan is amazing. one thing i do need to say is that if u ever get a chance to go to one of damien's shows - GO!! it is without a doubt the best show i have ever been to. i dont know how anyone else will top it. u would think its an acoustic setting and very mellow and chill....but it is the exact opposite, his songs come alive in concert and he adds drums and a base guitar and it sounds amazing...honestly everyone needs to go to one of his shows - it'll leave u breathless. so, buy this cd and go to his show, he is a brilliant.
B00004WEJZ|1.0|This is BY FAR the worst James Bond movie ever. It starts out pretty good (except for the crummy title song): Sean Connery is back in action as 007, he has a lot of great lines, and there are more beutiful women than usual. But about halfway through the movie I begin to realize why most Bond fans refuse to acknowledge &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; as part of the series. At this point, the script writer apparently ran out of dry one-liners, because not another witty thing comes out of Bond's mouth for the rest of the movie. And is it just deja vu, or am I seeing &quot;Thunderball&quot; all over again? What idiot wrote this? IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME AS THUNDERBALL! The story is the same, and the characters even have the same names! The only difference is that &quot;Thunderball&quot; was a good movie and &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; is not. This would have been forgivable if the movie was just Sean Connery playing James Bond one last time for fun, but the thing is, it isn't fun! Halfway through the movie one of Bond's female accomplices is gruesomely murdered and what little &quot;fun&quot; is left in the movie ends. It's strange that Bond never even mentions the girl who gets killed. I mean, come on James, the lady just died for you, you could at least say something about her! <BR>From here, the action starts to pick up. You'd think that the film would become more exciting because of this, but actually it gets more boring. I almost fell asleep a few times, and I'm not the kind of person who falls asleep during movies. A few scenes which should be entertaining, like an escape from a seaside castle and a gun battle in an underground cavern, are as boring as can be. Its amazing how incredibly dull a 007 action scene can be when it doesn't have Monty Norman's James Bond theme playing in the background. At this point I am thinking &quot;Please God, make the movie end!&quot; But it doesn't! It goes on and on and on. Every time I think it's going to end, it really isn't. Finally, Domino kills the villain, Largo, with a speargun (just like in Thunderball). But it is an underwater scene, and Largo is wearing scuba gear, so I can't see his face and I'm not even sure if she killed Largo or just some anonymous goon! I'm guessing that she killed Largo, because the movie (thank you God!) ends soon afterwords. Sean Connery: It's great that you came back to play James Bond, but you should have refused to do the movie until they came up with a better script. I, like other Bond fans, do not even consider this horrible disgrace to be part of the series. I'd like to pretend that it never happened.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|&quot;Requiem For a Dream&quot; was the most frightening film I have ever seen.  There were some parts that stayed with me for weeks, and I doubt I will want to watch it again. Not that I can say the movie wasn't written, directed, and acted very effectively.   I most definitely think this was one of the best films I've seen.  Although, I wouldn't suggest to anyone to watch this movie if they are in the least sensitive, because it will not be something you can easily forget.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|This is a superior album as compared to Brave New World. It has all the elements for a good metal album. However, as all albums go, it can never please everyone.<br />My Gripes:<br />1. The album production is not really that good. The drums are a bit too 'in the background' and unlike previous albums, the bass doesnt stand out that much.<BR>2. Where have all the triplets gone?!<BR>3. With 3 guitars, I would expect more versatility in terms of the melodies and harmonies.<br />That aside, here are the things which are good in the album:<br />1. Their songs still kicks... although it may sound very much like their previous albums. But isnt that what Maiden is about? Sticking to their roots...<BR>2. The title song simply took my breath away.<BR>3. Montsegur is another classic. I cant stop listening to it.<br />All in all, this is an album every metal fan should get. It may not be their best work but it sure as hell is one of the better metal offerings out there. It would be worth every single cent you spent. Just dont get it with the preconception that it's as good as their earlier works.<br />With that in mind, I urge you to buy this album. It's Iron Maiden, man!
B000002U3P|5.0|I finally bought this CD after putting it off for years. I mainly bought it for Underworld, but this whole CD is cool. I'm not into Iggy or Lou, but I don't skip any tracks on this CD. This came out in 1996, but sounds so fresh and relevant to today's culture. My least favorite track is, Lou Reed's &quot;Perfect Day,&quot; and my absolute favorite is, Blur's &quot;Sing,&quot; which barely beat Primal Scream's &quot;Trainspotting.&quot; The track that A track that surprised me is Pulp's hilarious &quot;Mile End.&quot; Brian Eno is always good, and &quot;Deep Blue Day&quot; will give Eno more record sales. Blur's lead singer has the last track called, &quot;Closet Romantic,&quot; which is a more of an electronic song. If you like emotionally charged tunes then go get this album.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonna, Baby, you've done it again!  <br />You've written and produced another challenging, progressive, unflinchingly honest album that defies what's popular, lowest common denominator, and palatable to the masses.<br />I haven't heard Springsteen's 'The Rising' yet but this might be the perfect post 9-11 album so far...<br />I love this album.  Took me a while to get it but with open heart, mind, and ears I understand everything on American Life.<br />This album is the soundtrack to our lives.  It really takes you on a spiritual/musical/emotional roller coaster ride.  All our ego, materialism, physical world obsessions...our hopes, faith, and dreams.<br />I admit...I have my bad days when I hate some songs (Mother and Father, I'm So Stupid, Hollywood, and Easy Ride).  They get on my nerves 'cause my negative/evil side considers them to be weak and whiny.  I thought, &quot;More Mirwais?  Pass them FREEDOM FRIES!&quot;<br />(I understand now why these four songs tend to irritate.  They reflect the side of myself that I am not happy with but am working to let go of.  Hollywood would have made a GREAT B-Side to ALife.)<br />But thankfully, Good always overcomes evil!  The mainstays that I never fast forward through are genius, intelligent, passionate, and move me to shivers and tears.<br />First song, ALife, is a brilliant storytelling of an American who has all these illusions in their pretty little head.  Upon waking up, he/she is understandably ticked off at what's been done to them.  How we've all been fed lies from the Big Guys.  From innocence to consciousness.  I love the acoustic melody...so fluid, beautiful, patriotic, and memorable.  Makes me want to salute.<br />Love Profusion and Intervention will melt the heart of any cold hearted fool.  So poppy, positive, these two exude warmth and love.  <br />Nothing Fails will change the world!  I truly believe this.  It will lift you from whatever darkness you are in.  It is an aural RAY OF LIGHT from The Lord Above.  It's like a smart bomb of Love.  It finds your hiding heart and burrows deep under all the pain and literally explodes.  <br />It's Nick Drake meets Jesus Christ.  Pass it on...  :)<br />Nobody Knows Me wins the award for Best Beat of The Year.  It's right up there with Dr. Dre and Eminem.  A total return to sender of all the criticism Madonna has received from the media in which every human being is disposable and soulless.  Very articulate, smarty pants, and well put.  <br />'I don't want your lies/ I don't watch TV/ I don't waste my time/ Or read a magazine'<br />(You can almost hear the media drawing their knives out...)<br />X-Static Process is another warm intimate yearning-spirit Nick Draker.  <br />Die Another Day...either you love or hate it.  A cut up collage of disparate sounds that works in the end.  In your face strings, perplexing lyrics, good beats, flamenco hand claps, electro-clash fade ins and out.  Totally Brilliant!<br />(Leave it to Madonna to make all this mainstream.  Now you know why she isn't everyone's favorite.  She wants us all to move forward...to climb the Tree of Life.  'To wake up, dress, and go')<br />It all winds down with Easy Ride.  Lyrics contemplate family and future.  'All I want is to live forever/ Not defined by time or space/ It's a lonely place/ But that's what I want for me...'<br />Wise words for an uncertain future.  What can we do but hope and pray.  (And be pro-active, compassionate, conscious, and vote.)<br />Madonna = America<br />Get the picture?<br />Nothing Fails, My fellow citizens.<br />Nothing Fails...(repeat ad infinitum)
B0000BYM3K|5.0|... all the songs on this album have elements of pastmaiden albums which is really good cause it gives the album a lot of variety. the 3 guitars work really well together on this album too. some great solos, awesome riffs. as usual, steves bass lines are really good too. thick sound as usual. and as usual, bruce's voice is always sounding good. <BR>   like i thought 'brave new world' was maidens heaviest album, i think 'dance of death' is just like BNW. i think the last 2 maiden albums have been the heaviest.<BR>   for many who will say that this album has too many songs that just sound like old maiden songs, i say who cares and stop being hypocritical. when maiden changed around the time of 'no prayer for the dying' you all whinged about it not being like old maiden and when maiden released BNW and now this one, u's all think it is just like old maiden and that they should experiment more. why would they want to experiment again after the way you guys treated em when they first experimented. i cant blame em for going back to their old roots. i say lets leave it at that and stay that way forever. u'll make the majority happy.<br />great album!...
0385121679|5.0|Full disclosure: I admire Stephen King's writing. This is not to say I like everything he's produced---\\"It\\" was one of the stupidest novels I've ever opened, and I put it down after slogging through the first 50 pages---but when he's good, he's VERY good. The Shining is one of his best, and it is indeed excellent. If you've seen the Kubrick film of the same name, don't be fooled---Kubrick told a different story from the original, having apparently no understanding of the fact that the evil being, as King conceived it, was NOT simply a product of an alcoholic's fall from sobriety, but was a separate entity that took advantage of the chinks in an alcoholic's armor. One of the prior reviewers of this book evidently missed that point as well, going on at length about how the mind is a powerful force, etc. B.S. This isn't a book about the depths of the human psyche, it's about accumulated evil taking on a life of its own to trap the sick---or the gifted. It's a recurring theme in King's fiction: little evils build up and develop within a physical structure or entity, evolving into a force that can attack the unwary or the weak. We see it in his other decent (but not great) works, Cujo and Christine.     Bottom line: if you want to choose the best of a gifted writer's work, The Shining is one of the books you should own. Salem's Lot, The Stand (choose the author's cut, not the original edition--it's longer, but so much the better, because it's that good!), Misery, The Dead Zone, and On Writing are the others I'd recommend. Second tier books are Firestarter, Cujo, Christine, Carrie, The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, and Eye of the Dragon. The rest I either haven't read, don't remember (which means they probably bored me) or don't think are very good. Avoid \\"IT\\" at all costs!
B00004U9MS|5.0|Wow...what an awesome CD. Never have I found something this amazing where I can listen to the CD over and over and not get tired of it. All the songs are so beautifully written, especially  Don't Panic and Shiver. I only just heard it this summer but I know it'll be one of my all time favourites, no one can compare to these guys, and no one comes close to CHRIS MARTIN!!! This CD got me through tough times and to all those haters out there who keep on bashing these guys for being copycats - OPEN YOUR EARS! They have their own sound, play their own instruments, and write their own songs. Face it, they're talented! I'm sorry Radiohead doesn't have the same mass appeal but you gotta let other artists and groups into the music buisness, change can be a good thing! COLDPLAY is hands down one of the best groups out there and I can't wait to see if they produce a follow-up album to the brilliant A Rush of Blood to the Head.
B000002UJQ|5.0|What you're about to read is not a review but a response to the comments made by Cranky Reviewer (see above).  What compelled me to respond is not what CR said by how he/she said it.  CR's review crossed a philosophical line, and I felt it was important that someone point it out.  My comments are interspersed below.<br />\\"You can rave about this CD all you want, but the truth is this: both Radiohead and \\"OK Computer\\" are overrated.\\"<br />Truth?  How can you possibly know the \\"true\\" value of any artistic expression?  I thought evaluative statements about art were inherently subjective given that there isn't a universal standard to measure them against.  Did you discover some mathematical formula that conclusively proves one band is better than another, or are you such an authority on music that your opinions on the subject qualify as fact?  Really, I want to know. <br />\\"People who aren't smart but want to appear cutting edge and intelligent will say they like this CD (when deep down they don't).\\"<br />Now you're claiming to have special knowledge of people's thoughts and feelings (not to mention IQs).  How can you be certain the people who claim to like this cd are doing so because they want to appear smarter?  Furthermore, what qualifies you to make judgments about other people's inner motivations?  Radiohead's music may not speak to you, but this doesn't mean other people can't enjoy it.  Once again, your subjective experience has come to represent the experience of every listener.<br />\\"But the fact is that this CD is tuneless pop with no dance songs.\\"<br />Again with the \\"facts\\" (see above).  Also, I'm not sure what you mean by \\"tuneless pop.\\"  I assume you're using the term loosely to mean melody, in which case you're statement would read \\"melody-less pop\\" -- a bit of an oxymoron but I'll let it slide.  However, the fact that you're dissatisfied with the cd because it doesn't contain any dance songs baffles me.  Perhaps you purchased this cd with the misconception that Radiohead write dance tunes (actually they did write one for their subsequent album Kid A).  Either that, or your criteria for determining an album's worth depends on the number of dance songs it contains.  Fair enough, except the issue of danceability is a tricky one.  Tastes vary, and what seems eminently danceable to some people will seem entirely undanceable to others.  So again, you see that the criteria you used to evaluate this cd is itself highly subjective.<br />\\"I'd skip this and get \\"Greatest\\" by Duran Duran, who are WAY better and more interesting than Radiohead.\\"<br />Perhaps to you, but there's no way of knowing for sure.  That's the beauty of opinions; they're unassailable because there's no way of determining who's right and who's wrong.  They express an individual point of view and the only person who can verify whether they're \\"true\\" or not is the person expressing them.  Now I don't care if you think Vanilla Ice is better than Radiohead, just don't express it as fact; it's egotistical and it invalidates other people's opinions.  I will concede one point of yours: if you buy Duran Duran instead of Radiohead you are in no danger of appearing either cutting-edge or intelligent -- at least not to me.
0451169514|5.0|\\"The terror, which would not end for another twenty-eight years--if it ever did end--began, so far as I can tell, with a boat made from a sheet of newspaper floating down a gutter swollen with rain.\\"<br /><br />This is the first line of \\"It,\\" the beginning to one of Stephen King's masterpieces, and probably the most incredible story I've ever read. Those who complain about it's length... they need patience. Those who complain about its characters... they need to look around at themselves and others. Those who complain about it being vulgar, vile, or horrific... that's part of the story, and not to embrace it means you miss out on something extraordinary.<br /><br />In the summer of 1958, seven friends encountered something horrible in their town of Derry, Maine. This something fed on children, hunting them, preying on them, and devouring them. It could shape itself in any way It liked, whatever their nightmares suited, but always with one trademark: the semblance of a clown. The seven friends all had something in common: They had all escaped It at some point. And in that summer, they learned about It, confronted It, and killed It... or so they thought.<br /><br />28 years later... A boy named Adrian Mellon is apparently thrown off a bridge by two other boys for his sexuality. It seems like an open-and-shut case, but the boys claim that there was something down below... a clown and a cloud of balloons.<br /><br />Soon the friends are being called back to Derry, told that It is back. They made a vow, sealed in blood, to return if It wasn't dead. Each of them is now very successful, and the thought of returning to Derry, of going back to the horror that they'd all forgotten, is more than they can bear, but they had made a promise.<br /><br />\\"It\\" is two stories being told at once. One is the story of their childhood, of their first encounter with Pennywise the Clown, their troubles with the local bullies, the impact of It upon their lives, their own personal struggles,and the eventual defeat of It. This is told from the beginning of the book to the near end of it. At the same time, the story of the return to Derry, of the research done to see what It was, the memories that were now urging to return, and subsequent events that followed which I won't spoil here. Both timelines alternate in their tellings to fit one another perfectly, even if not in perfect chronological order, and they're even further juiced with quick points of time long before their own, dipping into what else It has been up to. This construction is utterly beautiful in how it's placed, and completely builds the story up for all its plot points and climax. \\"It\\" also easily avoids a problem with many long Stephen King books: Plot threads that go nowhere.<br /><br />The characters are completely immersive and none are the all-too-well-known cliches. Bill Denbrough is the leader of the group, with a bone to pick with It, and his own problem of stuttering. Richie Tozier has a smart mouth and a big ego, one that hides things from the others that he's ashamed of, even in denial of. Eddie Kaspbrak is asthmatic and weak, but he has courage within him to help his friends. Stan Uris is a sensible and supportive friend, who helps bring understanding of things. Ben Hanscom is an overweight and loving boy who brings his own ingenuity to the group. Beverly Marsh is a tough, yet sweet girl, whose own problems at home help prepare her for what she must face with the others. And Mike Hanlon, a boy chased by the bullies for the color of his skin, who comes across the group with a desire to help, and also leading to one of the more emotional parts of the story, the Great Rock Fight. These are the seven friends whose unity and circumstances held them together against It, and who vowed to return. It isn't long before they feel familiar, as if you've known them all your life, as well as the troubles they've faced, especially those of punk and bully Henry Bowers, whose endless tormentdrives them into the very heart of It's lair.<br /><br />\\"It\\" is a story that does take some patience to get into after the initial hook, but afterward, you'll have trouble putting it down. The night I finished it for the first time, I was 200 pages from the end and it was already midnight, but I just had to keep going. I couldn't wait until morning. I had to read, see, feel... I had to know. Everything builds and builds, as well as giving off the love, excitement, and horror that abounds, and it doesn't let down. Every single event, be it touching, scary, or vulgar, is necessary to form the complete picture of what may be one of the greatest books you will ever read.
B000002GYW|5.0|This is the Eagles' best album. Hotel California is their most polished, and contains their best song (the title track), but Desperado is their best from top to bottom. The lyrics are heavy--not a throwaway line anywhere on the album. Some of today's bands could learn quite a bit about songwriting by studying this album. <br />As for the individual songs: Out of Control has the heaviest guitars I've ever heard from the Eagles. Doolin-Dalton, Desperado, and their reprises are almost chilling. Tequila Sunrise, Certain Kind of Fool, and Outlaw Man are amazing--lyrics, melody, vocals, and musicianship come together perfectly. Bitter Creek is the second best song Bernie Leadon contributed to the band, behind My Man (from On the Border). Saturday Night is beautiful--the way the piano and mandolin shadow each other on their solo (duet?) is haunting.<br />The Eagles, in their various incarnations, were never as good as they were here. It's difficult to quantify the majesty of this album with mere words, so just listen to it!
B00006FDCD|2.0|To start things off honestly: \\"It\\" is probably one of the poorest book adaptions I've seen in quite some time. After reading the book and finding an extraordinary piece of writing, an amazing work of art, I was thrilled to see the movie. I knew it couldn't be all that the book was, but I hope for some semblance...<br /><br />And some semblance is what I got... and that's all. The deep, thoughtful construction that helped build the novel, where both the stories, the side of 1958 and the side of 1985 (the years are changed in the movie, but there's nothing wrong with that) are shown alternatingly, starting with 1958, moving ahead to 1985, and back again, creating a heartfelt atmosphere. The movie instead plays the older part in the first segment, as one full flashback that tries to cram way too many events into one bit, whereas they should have simply tried to organize their own way of telling, and the more recent events in the second half. It seems like every event in the children's section is segmented into 15 minute episodes, just trying to pile notable events in from the book, and it doesn't work. It might have worked better if they kept the construction that King originally established, but even then it would have hardly stood, as they took the events for no reason.<br /><br />And even with this chronological sorting, they seemed to actually forget scenes and had to tack them on later as additional flashbacks that had little to do with the scene, but desperately needed introduction earlier.<br /><br />Gone is the unifying theme of the group: They each escaped It. That's there, in a way, but it's moreover just tossed in for scares, and horribly stupid ones at that. Gone is the leper with the three-foot tongue that chased Eddie down the traintracks. Gone is any fear or tension when Bill rides off on his bike with Stan (it was Richie in the book, but that's not important...It's supposed to be a moment of escape, but they just simply ride away, ruining all reason forSilver to matter until the end, when the makers suddenly remembered that they needed it.<br /><br />And then, the worst two bastardizations. It's ok if Richie encountered a werewolf instead of a giant statue. It's ok if the scene with Georgie at the start was during the day, stealing what could have been a truly horrific scene (maybe cause it was made for TV, that lightened it.) It's ok if the whole point of Henry's return is gone (maybe not... but I'd have let it slide.) And it's ok that they cut out the kids being lost after first believing they killed It (definitely because of the made for TV movie... hell, even a theatrical movie... I don't see that scene, even in suggestion, ever reaching film if this movie were to be remade and I'm not going to reveal it, you'll just have to read the book.) And gone is the origin of It. No, those things are forgivable... let's get to what isn't.<br /><br />Personal Bastardization: I felt jipped when they finally confronted It and the whole deadlights business was dumbed down. It wasn't supposed to be hypnotic, it was a staring contest, that would eventually lead into the Ritual of Chud. This point is missed. And then the Turtle (don't ask, read) is also gone, losing the relation to the universe that Stephen King set up in the novel. It's no wonder that the scene of Patrick Hockstetter and his demented fridge (aside from it being made for TV and that scene would never be allowed), as the dealings of the Other weren't explored or even mentioned. I wanted to see how they portrayed the whole scene and they didn't even have it, which ruined the entire final confrontation at the end.<br /><br />Universal Bastardization: The vow to return. In this, they easily walk out of the sewer and look outward, where Bill has them promise to return. In the novel, they crawl from there, exhausted and bewildered. Instead, there is no forced promise; they do it themselves, cutting their palms with a glass Coke bottle and making a blood pact that they would return if It was still alive. And the meaning disappeared as well, but I won't get into why, for fear of telling too much of the book, which I truly hope the readers of this review will read.<br /><br />Ok, I suppose I should get onto why I let this have two stars instead of one if I hated what it had done to the book, right?<br /><br />There are some beautifully horrifying scenes, such as when Beverly exits her childhood home and sees a balloon bouncing down the road, laughing. The sharkteeth in Pennywise's mouth aren't used well, but they look scary. And there was the great scene when they were children, where they hold hands in a circle and Stan suddenly finds himself holding hands with the clown. The acting is decent for a TV Movie and there are a few notable celebrities.<br /><br />These few things aren't enough to make the movie good, and it really would only be scary for young children, who probably shouldn't be watching it anyway.<br /><br />With the same budget and time space, a decent movie of \\"It\\" could have been made. Instead, there's this trash. I can only hope that someday, there will be another version of this created, one that captures the emotion, atmosphere, and incredible imagination that formed Stephen King's masterpiece of a novel, \\"It.\\"
0805062971|4.0|I've wanted to read this book for years, but put off my purchase until after I recently watched the film.  Despite knowing the all-important \\"twist\\" of the story, I still thoroughly enjoyed Palahniuk's ambicious first novel - a work that seems to give a voice to the subconscious, collective fears of America's newest generation of faltering adults.<br />Something about this novel reminded me strongly of Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting.  The criticism of how consumer culture has negatively impacted our generation is one strikingly similar aspect (\\"Choose washing machines, cars, compact disc players and electrical tin openers\\" vs. \\"...you're trapped in your lovely nest, and the things you used to own, now they own you\\").  While Welsh's strongest character eventually aspired to the nesting instinct, as embracing the conformity of \\"normal\\" society was the ultimate efface to his anti-social lifestyle, Palahniuk's nameless hero throws (or rather, blows) away all of those purchases he thought would make him whole.  As he says, \\"... no matter what goes wrong, at least you've got your sofa issue handled.\\"<br />I think the strongest similarity, however, and the aspect that makes Fight Club ring so true to our generation is the commentary on our \\"generation of men raised by women\\".  The desperation and desire of Fight Club's main character to be more than himself echoes the struggle of every male I know who constantly strive for balance in a society that gives so few strong male role models and so many mixed signals about \\"what makes a man\\".  The line \\"I am a 30 year old boy\\" made me think of so many of those friends of mine, and was the point in the book where I realized Palahniuk had tapped into something major.  There are many books out there by authors seeking to define our generation.  Palahniuk hasn't defined our generation, but he has given a voice to an often overlooked demographic - those white, middle-class, young adult males who, because they aren't a minority, poor or female, are expected to be completely satisfied with their lot in life and very, very often are not.  This is a powerful, important commentary and I hope it does more to open up a dialogue for others in that demographic, like Palahniuk, with a story to tell.<br />Fight Club is a fast, gripping read in an almost stream-of-consciousness style.  I would have liked for Palahniuk to have explored the relationship between Tyler and the narrator a little more effectively, but perhaps I was just spoiled by watching the film before reading the book.  Fight Club also gets a little slippery after grabbing onto a theme or concept, such as the desire to destroy history or the ease with which Tyler drums up a corps of willing space monkeys to do his bidding, which left me wanting for more of a conclusion.<br />All together, though, this is a very strong book and a telling look into the hearts and minds of the \\"middle children of history\\" ... who are just beginning to realize that they aren't going to be millionaires and movie stars, and are very, very pissed off by that fact.female, are expected to be completely satisfied with their lot in life and very, very often are not.

B00008OLYN|5.0|This is probably the best work since McCartney's Hey Jude. I have no doubts that if Mikael Akerfeldt and Steven Wilson joined their songwriting powers they could as well compete with The Beatles. (and yes I own all Opeth album and my fav of all time is Blackwater Park)
0393314804|5.0|This isn't merely a book about heroin addiction.  This isn't simply a book about the underbelly of society.  Trainspotting is so much more than any rubberstamp explanation, \\"What's it all about?\\"  This is a book that is deceptively simple: an account of life in urban Scotland narrated by a group of people connected by friendship, addiction, pain, loss, illness, sex and death. Through the eyes of these young adults we see beyond these connections to what really drives their society (and often pushes it to the breaking point): classism, racism, sexism, the shadow of regime and military occupation, a government that has abandoned them, adults who discount them, a society that has disowned them.<br />Each story (many of which were originally featured as short stories in magazines or literary collections) takes on the distinctly unique voice of the character at hand, whether it be the cocksure Sick Boy, the eager to please Spud, the masochistic Begbie or the intellectual, self-loathing Renton.  Welsh doesn't attempt to moralize his characters or even have them explore too deeply into their all-too-apparent dysfunctions - these speak volumes on their own.  He simply has them observe, each giving a distinct insight to their collective station in life.  The end result, coupled with the clever use of Scots dialect, is completely immersive.  You begin to see and feel through the eyes and experiences of these characters in a way too rarely experienced through the written word.<br />Trainspotting is hardly uplifting or inspiring.  There are moments that are difficult to read through, that are hilarious, silly, sickening, boring.  Altogether... real.<br />This book, along with works by Chuck Palahniuk, Douglas Coupland and George Saunders, has been cited as one of the novels that defines my generation.  I'm still not sure if I should be alarmed or flattered by this fact.  I think I'll take the latter.  Trainspotting, along with the other examples, excels at showing that we are a generation of voids surrounded by a million examples of why we should just give up, but we don't.  We remain eternally hopeful, as do Welsh's bittersweet characters, that the best is yet to come, even if it never does.<br />An important, powerful book and highly recommended!generation of voids surrounded by a million examples of why we should just give up, but we don't.

0060090367|4.0|Well well well. What can I say? This book changed me life, as one of the many irish characters in this books would say. Actually, it is not life-changing, but it is entertaining. Good fun. Marian Keyes is hilarious.
0375703764|5.0|I was not sure I would enjoy this book when I first picked it up and saw...(gasp!) footnotes. But, despite the initial shock, I put this book through my in-store-two-paragraph-&quot;grip&quot; test. If a book does not grip me into its world in the first two paragraphs, I do not bother. <br />Not only did I make it through the first two paragraphs, but I had to force myself to stop after two pages. That was that. I took it home.<br />House of Leaves is a complicated book, no doubt, but just as it teeters on the point of losing you, the author pulls you back in with something curious...something just strange enough that you feel compelled to keep going. In many ways, your journey as a reader parallels the strange journey of the characters as they explore the house that is ever-changing and larger on the inside than it is on the outside.<br />I'm not going to tell you that I understood this book completely in my first and only reading. I thought I understood most of it by the time I finished the body of the book. And then I read one particular section of the Appendix. I realized at this point the profound implications of the book. I suddenly had new theories about the entire structure of the story and the symbolism of things.<br />For those of you who, like me, prefer fiction over non-fiction, do not be intimidated by the footnotes. Despite the brief boring sections of this book, the storyline holds you throughout. (Previous reviewers claim a lack of plot...I completely disagree.) <br />I think this book will appeal to readers who prefer dark, complex, psychological, and thought-provoking books, but who also want to be pulled into another world. This is definitely not a quick summer read, but it is well worth the journey you take into the house on Ash Tree Lane and, more importantly, into the minds of the characters.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|This story-album is great.  It grew on me with each listening.  The tale each song tells is intriguing, eliciting powerful emotional and social chords in a way only Neil Young can. While the songs are long they are never boring. And one can feel Crazy Horse in every song.  They may start out a bit mellow but by the end of the album they kick it in just like in the old days!  The bass and drumwork reverberate in a way that will make you want to keep cranking up the volume!
B00006RU5B|3.0|As good and as original as this group's sound is...I simply can't get too into the album.  If you liked the radio releases for the edgy tone and straightforward lyrics you might not care too much for the majority of these tracks.<br />Many of the tracks come off as either cheesy.  The greatness of Chris Cornell's voice simply fades into one long whine that prevails through most of the album.<br />Not exactly one I'd recommend unless you already know that you really love one of the songs.
B00005QG9J|4.0|4.5 stars, and so much better than most anything else out today.  with a handful of mediocre songs, it's definitely not as good as the flawless album, &quot;make yourself&quot;, so i'll go ahead and round down.  but that leaves a big handful of songs that are awesome, which is nothing to be disappointed about.<br />it's really hard for me to choose a favorite on this album.  &quot;nice to know you&quot; is really really phenomenal.  but &quot;blood on the ground&quot; is a perfect rockin song, and &quot;warning&quot; is the perfect pop song.  and &quot;under my umbrella&quot; has so much energy when that awesome chorus comes out.  the mellow &quot;mexico&quot;, &quot;just a phase&quot;, and &quot;11 am&quot; are all great too.<br />these are only my favorites, though.  i've heard a lot of opinions on this album, and everybody seems to like different songs.  which totally baffles me, cuz the songs i mentioned are by far my favorite on the album and some of incubus's best songs, in my opinion.

0385509456|1.0|Being the parent of a child with an autistic spectrum disorder, I was eager to read this book.  Unfortunately, I did not enjoy this book at all.  From a literary perspective, the approach of using the autistic teen-ager as narrator was unique and interersting.  However, the genre of the novel jumped from mystery to soap opera very quickly and the ending was rushed and unsatisfying.  Other than the narrator, the only sympathetic figure was the boys teacher and we only know her in the teacher/therapist context.<br />Besides just not being a fun book to read, my biggest problem with the book is that it relies on stereotypical views of how autistic people perceive the world.  My son is autistic and I saw very little of him in Christopher's character although he is also high functioning (albeit younger at age 10).  First, only a tiny percentage of autistics are savants but apparently only savants are interesting enough to portray in fiction (this book, the movies Rain Main, Mercury Rising).  If austistics aren't portrayed as savants, they are portrayed as retarded - neither is true with my son.  Where are the average, ordinary autistic kids in literature?<br />Not all autistics fall so totally on the analytical side of spectrum; my son has no interest in logic or math but is very interested in fiction - like alot of autistics, Disney movies are a passion with him.  He is extremely affectionate and still loves to cuddle.  My son is also very capable of lying - he is as adept as any child in acting totally innocent when asked if he did somehing wrong.  That all austistics can't deal with change is also incorrect; my son loves to go new places and barely notices when I rearrange the furniture in his bedroom.<br />I also thought the novel implied that an autistics reactions to the world are unchangeable or modifiable through therapy.  We know Christopher goes to a special school (I was suprised he wasn't in a regular school like all of the high functioning autistic childrenI know but chalk that up to differences in the British system) but beyind teaching him math and language/ reading/ writing, it is not clear that any behavior issues have been addressed.  At three my son may have reacted like Christopher when touched (hitting whoever touched him) but by 6 this type of behavior was extinguished through therapy.  At 3, my son reacted to crowds like Christopher did in the train station; with therapy, he now handles crowds quite well.   <br />The novel also implies that living with an autistic is such a difficult experience that parents can't cope and families fall apart.   While there are difficulties living with an autistic child (especially when they are quite young), autistics often are alot of fun and bring great joy to their families.  The implication in this novel is that Christopher's problems bring the family to the crisis it is in is distasteful.<br />So basically I feel like the good aspects as this book do not outweigh the reliance on a steretypical and limited perspective on autistics.
B00008IAMD|4.0|Very little ever touches me, but I must agree for a variety of reasons that Hurt is an incredible cover, and I believe it the finest music video ever made. I was shocked to hear of his death today, given that he left the hospital only the other day. As my tastes lean more toward techno and ambient, and considering the fact I never wrote a review for anything on Amazon before this, it should speak volumes that I put in my two cents to the unitiated...
B000002AGM|5.0|&quot;Miles Ahead,&quot; one of the finest collaborations between Miles Davis and Gil Evans, is one of those CDs you can play any time, and love it just as much the hundredth time you hear it as the first. Evans' imaginative arrangements, moving fluidly between the jagged and the mellow, caress Davis' cool, laconic trumpet the way Nelson Riddle's arrangements caress Sinatra's voice. The ten tunes on this CD are played as one continuous skein of music, progressing from the propulsive excitement of &quot;Springsville&quot; to the mellow beauty of &quot;The Maids of Cadiz&quot; and &quot;My Ship,&quot; the piquant wit of &quot;New Rhumba&quot; and the infectious good humor of &quot;I Don't Wanna Be Kissed (By Anyone But You).&quot; For anyone who loves Miles Davis, this CD is essential, and for anyone who loves the sound of a big band playing cool jazz, this is a total delight.
B000002KHY|4.0|This album contains so many low key  yet fascinating songs.  The lyrics are great.  The guitar playing is incomparable.  A couple of my favorite covers (Carole King's 'You've Got a Friend' and Marvin Gaye's 'How Sweet It Is'), Some fabulous hits (Shower the People, Sweet Baby James, Fire and Rain), and some more obscure hits (Walking Man, Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight) are included.  Buyer Beware:  If the f-word is not your thing, there is a live version of Steamroller which probably won't make you happy.  My advice to you is to invest in some of James' original cd's from his early career and sit back and enjoy! Or you can just skip that track. The first eleven are priceless! Definitely a keeper!
B000002L80|2.0|What happened here?  Having heard the masterpiece Remain in Light and the nearly as wonderful Speaking in Tongues, I was utterly shocked by their near-complete abandonment of the distinct and innovative sound they were building for themselves.<br />Granted, many of their lyrics actually look very good on paper (by the way, Radiohead fans, compare the liner notes to those for Hail to the Thief...I wonder if \\"Tchocky\\" was thinking of this album?).  Nearly every one of them has clever turns of phrase, interesting points to ponder, such as \\"Creatures of Love\\", \\"Television Man\\"...although about \\"Stay Up Late\\", all I'll say about that one is, I do NOT want to know.  However, the way they're put into music is singularly unimpressive.  What happened to the basslines and melodies that defy all common sense, yet still manage to sound good?  What happened to the Middle Eastern/African influences?  And that synth imitation of a Rhodes should have been banned from the studio (although I must give credit to the Hammond player).  Furthermore...although I initially had problems getting used to them, where are David Byrne's quirky vocals and strange noises (other than somewhat on \\"Television Man\\", perhaps the only remarkable song on the album)?  This bland style simply doesn't suit him.<br />All in all, this is an album made up of songs that could have sounded good--if the music had approached the level of the lyrics (which save the album from a 1-star, no-merit review).  I will not even be giving this CD my customary three listens for it to prove itself...this one is going immediately for trade-in.
B000065VB9|5.0|...make it this one.  <br />This third &quot;Peter Gabriel&quot; disc (a.k.a. &quot;Melt&quot;) could have been titled &quot;Sociology&quot;.  There is no &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; here.  No &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;.  No &quot;Steam&quot;.  The closest thing to a hit here is &quot;Games Without Frontiers&quot;, which was edited and issued as a moderate-charting single.  What you get instead is an aural look at the world around us - a piece of art that will sometimes send a chill down the spine, sometimes bring a lump to the throat, always leave you thinking.<br />The songs on &quot;Melt&quot; deal with man's inhumanity to man, both on a global scale and one-on-one. Gabriel's approach is primarily first person, bringing us closer to each narrator in these tracks.  Just as he used to mask himself in fox heads and what-not during his long-ago Genesis days to take on another persona, so he does in his songs - often to chilling effect.<br />The disc opens with &quot;Intruder&quot;, Phil Collins' hypnotic thump setting the tone as Gabriel creepily takes on the role of house intruder - less a thief, more psychopathic.  <br />&quot;Family Snapshot&quot; puts us inside the mind of an assassin, in the final seconds before he pulls the trigger.  A standout track on this album (and every track on this album stands out).<br />Xenophobic hatred and paranoia is the subject of much of this release.  &quot;And Through The Wire&quot;, &quot;Not One Of Us&quot;, and the UK hit &quot;I Don't Remember&quot; all conjure mental images of unfriendly border crossings and nationalistic distrust and hate.  &quot;Games Without Frontier&quot; makes the simple point that if looks really could kill, someone would surely use it as a weapon.  Children playing war games with real weapons.<br />The album closes with the Gabriel classic, &quot;Biko&quot;, a moving homage to martyred South African activist / poet Stephen Biko. The eight-minute opus opens with an African chant, is pierced with cries of &quot;Yihla Moja&quot; (roughly translated &quot;let the spirit descend&quot;) and ends with a mournful rendition of &quot;Die Stem&quot;, the South African national anthem. A very loud, resounding drum slap like the slam of a jail cell door closes this very heavy album.  (It's ashame that, when Geffen remastered / reissued the Peter Gabriel catalog, they didn't include bonus tracks.  &quot;Shosholoza&quot;, a rare track issued as the 'B'-side of the British &quot;I Don't Remember&quot; single, would have fit beautifully after &quot;Biko&quot;.  &quot;Shosholoza&quot; is a traditional South African song of hardship.)<br />The third &quot;Peter Gabriel&quot; album is an album of moments: moments of fear and moments of pain; moments of sanity and moments of madness; moments of rocking and moments of ballad.  But there are no love songs here.  What you get is an honest assessment of the world and how we relate to one another on a global scale.<br />And the assessment is pretty bleak, and tragically accurate.<br />It's sad that today, twenty-three years after this album first came out, every track still rings true.  Perhaps even more so now than in 1980.<br />Not the &quot;feel good&quot; album of the eighties.  But certainly one of the most powerful.<br />Musically, this third solo outing proved the artistic turning point of Peter Gabriel's post-Genesis career.  While his first two solo LPs were engaging and original, Gabriel finally hit his stylistic stride with &quot;Melt&quot;.  Synthesizers abound, but not abrasively. (No dyed-haired 80's synth-pop here). Great attention is given to the details in this recording. Musically, you feel the creepiness of &quot;Intruder&quot;, the loneliness of &quot;Family Snapshot&quot; and the anger of &quot;And Through The Wire&quot;.  The instrumentation perfectly compliments the lyrics on each track.<BR> <BR>Guests include fellow Genesis member Phil Collins, Kate Bush, Robert Fripp (who's guitar atmospherics add much color to thisCD), Paul Weller of The Jam and Dave Gregory of XTC.  <br />If you want to hear &quot;Big Time&quot;, buy the &quot;Shaking The Tree&quot; compilation.  Or turn on your local 80's radio station.  If you want a powerful, honest piece of work by an outstandingly original musical artist, buy this CD.
078322608X|4.0|The movie is like one big crazy dream: its characters, its storyline, its settings, its props. It is this very quality of the movie, which makes it too overbearingly sickening, and at the same time, a really good one, and worth pondering on. <br />The whole movie revolves around time-travel. This itself sounds a bit insane. If this is not enough, the muddled characters, and the disturbingly unimaginable path the movie goes through, only to reach a seemingly absurd end, could prove to be too much on the senses; and if one is looking for even a teensy weensy bit of reality, then this movie has all the essential elements to render it as one of the worst sci-fi ever. <br />On the flipside, the movie also has all the sine qua non of a very well-made science-fiction flick, only if taken in the right sense. The movie is actually meant to be a crazy dream. Considering the concept of the movie, it is best made, like a crazy dream. The acting is extraordinary. With `insanity' being the cool word binding the movie, both the lead actors, Brad Pitt and Bruce Willis, do justice to the nutty parts, assigned to them. Complementing the acting, are the symbolic backdrops: the subterranean world immersed in red metallic shades (hell), and the sublunary world, bitten with the bitterest icy cold (living hell.) <br />This flick is best enjoyed, if one empathizes with the underlying messages behind the whole inanity of the movie and its characters: what will result the apocalypse? Is it man who will be solely responsible for apocalypse? Or, what on earth, are we humans doing with this planet? Is science too dangerous to handle? With a little pondering, forced or naturally invoked, one can actually identify with all the craziness of this movie. This flick represents our mad world, in which the end is really not that far away.
B00005JM09|5.0|Johnathan Mostow has done a brillant job of taking over James Cameron.T3 is incrediable movie and is a terrific follow-up to T2.Every actor or actress in this movie are terrific,especially Nick Stahl and Arnold.The visual are great in this as well.I am extremly pleased.I hope that T4 will be just as good,if not better,than this one.And I don't care if Mostow or Cameron direct it or not.Mostow should come back if Cameron decides not to.Anyway,great movie.Go see this in the theater and don't wait for the DVD
B000092ZYX|5.0|Let me start of with there there..I cant pin point exactly what it is--the lyrics or the tune...I suppose its one complementing the other....which makes this one of radioheads most complex songs....not because of any guitar riffs or bass lines or any creepy instruments--just that X factor I cant exactly hit upon...it leaves me mesmorised--not to mention the amazing video it has....     I've come to like 'go to sleep' a lot after I've seen the video...it really does have one hell of a video...very pertinant and relevent to the song unlike some of their previous videos like 'street spirit or 'fake plastic trees'.....  2+2=5 was my favorite from this album when I'd heard it first.. its an amazing song--total desparation and hopelessness..and this mood is carried over into 'sit down.stand up'...followed by another psychadelic masterpiece 'sail to the moon'...absolutely mind blowing....I even love 'scatterbrain'.it reminds me of my childhood a lot...theres a strong sense of naustalgia when I hear that song--wolf at the door too is amazing...overall I'd say this beats the bends but seconds to Ok computer....and yes it requires a fair bit of interpretting lyrically---so its not an album you want to be forming an opinion about in one hearing...
B00000JGEH|4.0|James Cameron's The Terminator is a work of art!It has good acting,terrific story,and great direction from Cameron.The visual effects are good for their time as well.The weakest of the three,but still fun and enjoyable.The sequals are great,if not better,than this one. See This!
B00008HCCF|3.0|I loved Norah's CD, but she looks and acts so nervous here (in between numbers) that I found it distracting. As another reviewer commented, give the woman a towel... The DVD's 5.1 sound was excellent, the musicianship was as extraordinary as her CD--except for her guitarist, whose instrument was out of tune.
B00005JM09|5.0|The third Terminator is the best one yet!Mostow did a great job taking over James Cameron as the director.Arnold is great in this,as is the rest of the cast.The visual effects and the action sequences are great as wellCan't wait until the movie comes out on video and I hope T4 comes out soon!I also Mostow directs T4 as well and,if he does,do a even better job than he did here!Great Movie!
B0000640VO|5.0|I first noticed &quot;Amelie&quot; when going through the local DVD rental store... A woman told me that she couldn't get past the cover art of the washed- out face of Amelie to try renting the movie. The exterior art, honestly does no justice whatsoever to the gem of a disc inside (the character does not look pale like the cover photo suggests).<br />I get very curious about the obscure titles -- especially the foreign films -- that wind up on the shelves of the rental stores, so I write down title names and surf imdb.com (internet movie database) to learn more about titles I haven't recognized. And after reading the reviews, I decided to grab the less- than- attractive box and check out the movie.<br />Immediately as the root menu is accessed, some rather inviting music accompanies the animated menu. So I set up the audio (no English dub, it's French language in digital 5.1 audio) and was blown away from the moment the opening scene played.<br />I knew from the first scene that this had the potential of being a well- written, acted, scripted, and produced movie. And as the credits rolled at the end, I wanted to see more of Amelie, who was a wonderful and genuine character, one you wished lived in your own neighborhood. And I also believe that both women and men would really enjoy this. Most guys would fall in love with Amelie's eyes, and more women would enjoy the sensitive style of creatively showing a woman's emotions. But I get the sense that a few women may not care for Amelie's character, honestly.<br />The original music (no lyrics) of composer Yann Tiersen will stay in your head, even if you can't get past the subtitles. Tiersen did a fabulous job of creating a score that suits every scene it's played in. The audio is rich and expansive, and can be enjoyed with even the most basic speakers.<br />&quot;Amelie&quot; makes me wish that I had learned French, and I envy anyone who understands the language for being able to understand the dialogue without having to read a translation. It can be a little difficult to have to watch two things at once -- subtitles and a movie -- because early on, you'll feel like you're missing the movie everytime you have to read the translation. But trust me on this, &quot;Amelie from Montmartre&quot; is a movie that you'll enjoy watching again and again. It's a rare treat to find a movie that doesn't get &quot;tired.&quot; And as you watch &quot;Amelie&quot; again, you'll enjoy more of the cinematography and the lush, saturated colorful scenes.<br />The DVD has many different options to dive into, which is a great thing since you'll probably fall in love with &quot;Amelie.&quot;<br />PS- For lovers of traditional blues, watch for a B&amp;W clip on the television of an elderly one- legged man tap dancing. His name is &quot;Peg Leg&quot; Sam (Jackson), and there are two CDs of music that this late singer recorded, &quot;Kickin' It&quot; and &quot;Early in the Morning.&quot; Well worth the search.g to read a translation.

B00005JKHN|4.0|Disneys' &quot; Sleeping Beauty&quot; was one of the first movies I ever saw in the theater and it remains one my personal favorite. This stunning DVD showcases the films strengths- its visual beauty, the gorgeous music and the splendor of its design. The story is a bit weak but the battle with the dragon alone is worth the price of this DVD- but there is so much interesting extras that both young and old will find this a must have for the collection.
0790731940|5.0|You don't need to know a thing about the old TV show to enjoy this comedic gem.  There are several plot twists that will keep you interested from start to finish.  Couple that with a great script and an excellent cast and you've got the winning formula from which this movie was built upon.<br />P.S:  Watch closely for a hilarious Danny Glover cameo!
B000002KGT|4.0|I mean this is an ok album for anyone, but if your into that pop/rock kind of thing you'll rate this a 5 star album but I am a hard rocker and I cant really get into some of the songs on this album. I bought it because I heard 'Dreams' on the radio and loved Stivie Nicks voice and thought that was one of the best sogns I had ever heard, but when I got the album and listened to it I enjoyed it but is was to soft for my taste. The Song 'Oh Daddy' I think is just really really bad I cant stand to hear it! 'Songbird' gets on my nerves. I cant stand a few other songs either but I will tell you abotu the good things now. The first five songs are all great! Ten 'The Chain' 'You Make Lovin Fun' and Gold Dust Women' are all somewhat good songs. But I will tell you this album gets old after a while. But maybe its just me , but I can tell you that you will love it if you like pop or pop/rock.
B00009P1O0|4.0|I was banning all releases from the RIAA (due to their heavyhanded reaction to music downloaders) until I found out that Neil Young's &quot;On the Beach&quot; had been released. This album was even hard to find on vinyl (I finally found it in Winnipeg around 1981, it was the only time I ever saw this album in stores until this CD release). The reasons it has not been released on CD until now are obscure and must be utterly baffling. One of Young's best and darkest albums (it's almost right up there with &quot;Tonight's The Night&quot; in thematic darkness), it includes at least two of his best songs: &quot;For the Turnstiles&quot; (banjos are supposed to be happy instruments, but here Young manages to give the instrument a tinge of a dark edge) and &quot;Walk On&quot; (which seems to be about leaving a bad scene when things get strange, which pretty much sums up what Young did when fame hit him like a brick - he described it in an interview at the time as &quot;heading for the ditch&quot;). The last 3 songs are on the longer side (these made up side 2 of the lp - my wife, who is younger than I, just learned tonight that lps have 2 sides and have to be flipped), and include some of Young's best lyrics: &quot;All along the navajo trail, burnouts stub their toes on garbage pails&quot;, &quot;You're only real with your makeup on&quot;, &quot;The world is turnin' I hope it don't turn away&quot;, &quot;There ain't nothin' like a friend that can tell you you're just pissin' in the wind&quot;, &quot;An ambulance can only go so fast, it's easy to get buried in the past&quot;, etc. There's not a lot of uppity or warm fuzzies on this album. &quot;Walk On&quot; is the only real toe-tapper (unless you're drunk, then you can stagger along with &quot;Vampire Blues&quot;). Most of the music has a heartbreaking sloppy beauty to it that only Neil Young can get away with. Fans of &quot;Harvest&quot; must have been doubly fazed, since this one followed &quot;Time Fades Away&quot; (another one that needs to be released on CD) and his experimental film soundtrack &quot;Journey Through The Past&quot;. Young obviously made the right choice, he hasn't burned out or rusted yet after numerous albums. Running head first into the fame machine created by &quot;Harvest&quot; probably would have prematurely ended his career.

B00000J7J4|3.0|I give this album and over all rating of 3 stars because it is good but it isnt that good, I mean its not one of Santanas best albums. But as always his guitar playing is over the top and would blow most any other guitar player out of the water! Sogns like 'Out Your Lights On' 'Smooth' and 'Maria Maria' earnd this record like 8 grammys and made it go all the way to #1 on the charts. All the songs here are good in their own right but some are not as good as they could have been like 'Do You Like The Way' and 'Wishing it Was' both are good songs but could have been better, I am not sure why but it feels like both songs are missing something. My personal favorite song on the album is either 'Love Of My Life' with Dave Matthews or 'The Calling' with none other then slowhand himself Eric Clapton, yes Eric Clapton two of the top 5 guitar players of all time on one song, and it sure will please. SO as I said before this isnt Santanas best album but it is a really good album by any standards!
B00005JKZV|5.0|This review is for LOTR - The Two Towers theatrical release DVD.<br />The long awaited release of the theatrical version DVD is finally available and it is an absolutely incredible film and DVD.  From the moment that it was announced that Peter Jackson would be filming &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; many Tolkien fans, casual or diehard expressed both joy and anxiety over the filming of this literary classic.  They expressed joy over finally being able to see this extraordinary story in film and anxiety over whether director Peter Jackson would be able to be true to the original story and do justice to it.  <br />Despite the theatrical releases of both the first and second films being three hours each, Peter Jackson still couldn't fit everything in, but that's what the Extended versions are for and if the Extended version being released in November is anywhere near as good as the first one, it should be an exceptional experience that brings the film closer to being true to Tolkien's original work.  As to Peter Jackson being able to do justice to Tolkien's literary masterpiece; he not only does justice to it, the first two films have been nothing less than extraordinary!<br />Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Cate Blanchett, John Rhys-Davis, Bernard Hill, Christopher Lee, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Orlando Bloom, Hugo Weaving, Miranda Otto, David Wenham, Brad Dourif and Karl Urban all deserve high praise for bringing their great performances to this classical story that will certainly go down in the history books as the finest set of films ever to be produced.  Even higher praise goes to Andy Serkis, who brought Gollum to life, despite never actually being seen in the film, without his efforts, the reality of Gollum would never have made it to the film.<br />High praise should go to Director Peter Jackson for his use of special effects in the manner in which he has in this and the first film.  The special effects are quite obviously there, but they're not what drive the film, but an asset to it.  Many directors could've easily used special effects to drown out the most important part of this film, the characters, their individual stories and how they interact with one another.<br />The premise:<br />As &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; closed; Boromir has been killed in battle with the Uruk-hai , Frodo and Sam have lead off on their own to reach Mordor and Merry and Pippin have been captured by the Uruk-hai.  Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli have vowed to catch up with the Uruk-hai to free Merry and Pippin...<br />As &quot;The Two Towers&quot; opens up, we see Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli in pursuit of the Uruk-hai in hopes of freeing Merry and Pippin and we see Frodo and Sam, on their quest to find Mordor, though they're having problems finding their way through the mountains.  They soon discover that they're being followed and capture their pursuer, Gollum, who once possessed the ring for a very long time, and is now an ancient creature, who at one time had been Hobbit like, but he's been &quot;distorted&quot; by his possession of the ring, or more specifically, the rings possession of him.  We're soon brought to the return of Gandalf, who is now Gandalf the White after his epic battle with the Balrog which is a cinematically beautiful battle between a wizard and demon.<br />What follows from there is nothing short of one the most entertaining films ever created.  The Battle of Helm's Deep alone is so epic in proportion that it somewhat lessens the experience of other films where there were &quot;epic&quot; battles.  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />- Revealing the Secrets Behind the Production of the Epic Adventure:<BR>     - On the Set-The Lord of the Rings:  The Two Towers<BR>     - Return to Middle-Earth<BR>- A Short Film Directed by Sean Astin - &quot;The Long and the Short of it&quot;<BR>- The Making of &quot;The Long and the Short of it&quot;<BR>- Featurettes:<BR>     - Created for lordoftherings.net, Take a Closer Look at the People and Places of Middle-Earth:<BR>        - Forces of Darkness<BR>        - Designing the Sounds of Middle-Earth<BR>        - Edoras:  The Rohan Capital<BR>        - Creatures of Middle-Earth<BR>        - Gandalf the White<BR>        - Arms and Armor<BR>        - The Battle of Helm's Deep<BR>        - Bringing Gollum to Life<BR>- Exclusive 10-minute Behind the Scenes Preview of &quot;The Return of the King&quot;<BR>- Theatrical Trailers and TV Spots<BR>- &quot;Gollum's Song&quot; Music Video by Emiliana Torrini<br />- Preview of Electronic Arts' Video Game - &quot;LOTR - The Return of the King<BR>- An Inside Look at the Special Extended DVD Edition of &quot;The Lord of the Rings:  The Two Towers&quot;
B000001F26|4.0|When I was getting into guitar playing and music and Clapton and all I bought this and it was a really good intro into the world of Clapton and blues guitar. You get a lot of good clapton songs here like the D+D classic 'Layla' and the killer songs 'Wonderful Tonight' and 'Cocaine' all three of which were mega hits, but anyways those songs are great and all the songs on here but you must dive into Claptons albums to get his best work. But this is a great way to start.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|As an &quot;old school metalhead' I've been very disappointed with recent releases from my old favorites. Metallica, Megadeth, Judas Priest, Dio, Queensryche, Slayer - they were all once masters of their own styles but their recent albums (with the possible exception of Dio's &quot;Killing the Dragon&quot;) have been horrible letdowns. I also haven't liked Maiden't last three or four albums, so I've been forced to discover new and exciting bands like Immortal, Therion, Dimmu Borgir and so on to fill my playlists.<br />Until today.<br />&quot;Dance of Death&quot; simply blew me away. It's not as good as &quot;Seventh Son of a Seventh Son&quot; (which is my personal favorite maiden album) but it has all the hallmarks of their old style and energy. For a band that has been around for as long as they have, iron Maiden have managed to capture the essence of what once made them great and deliver a great set of tracks. If you saw the *HORRIBLE COVER ART* and wondered why Maiden didn't just retire and bask in their lost glory - as I almost did - you should pick up this album. You (probably) won't be disappointed.

B00008MNYS|5.0|So like just about every other review, I will start by expressing my disgust that Robbie Williams is not a pop music god in the US, as he is just about everywhere else in the world.  Honestly, whats wrong with us that Michael Jackson-wannabe prettyboy Justin Timberlake rules the charts and Robbie is ignored?  First of all, Robbie is so much more sexy, has a killer sense of humor (Handsome Man), and can just flat-out out-sing Justin any day of the week (Feel).  He is the future of all decent pop music, and until the US realizes that, we will continue to be in the backwaters of world music.

It envokes those same feelings you got when you watched the movie:  chills, smiles, tears, anger, fear... excellent for any mood, and any activity.<BR>I highly recommend getting this CD, even if you aren't quite sure.  You won't be sorry.
B00008WT5M|5.0|Earlier this year I rediscovered AC/DC with their immortal classic &quot;Back in Black&quot;. I am not a big metalhead that I once was just a decade ago back in high school. I really don't care for today's brand of hard rock. A lot of it I find contrived and pure drivel. Most hard rock bands won't last long as AC/DC has, nor will they have a lasting impact that the legendary Aussie band has over rock 'n roll music. I found a used copy of the remastered &quot;Razor's Edge&quot; today. I loved songs like &quot;Thunderstruck&quot;, &quot;Moneytalks&quot; and &quot;Are You Ready&quot; back in high school and I still do to this day, so I had to buy this album. &quot;Razor's Edge&quot; may not be &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; (another AC/DC album I need to get) or &quot;Back in Black&quot; but it sure as heck a fun album to listen to. I almost forgot how much I loved &quot;Are You Ready&quot; with its sing along chorus from rhythmn guitarist Malcom Young and bassist Cliff Williams. An absolutely infectious hard rock song that just sticks into the listener's head permenantly. &quot;Thunderstruck&quot; is without a doubt one of the best songs that showcases Angus Young's undeniable guitar talents and a reminder to young and upcoming guitarists why he is still one of the best hard rock guitarists around. Like &quot;Are You Ready&quot;, &quot;MoneyTalks&quot; is incredibly catchy with its sing-along chorus. I love that song  to pieces. That song ranks right up there with &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot; and &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; as one of the overall best AC/DC tracks around. AC/DC gets a lot of flack for sounding the same on each record but I see the band staying true to their bluesy hard rock sound and consistently putting out great rock and roll albums. So what if each album sounds alike? AC/DC has been around for two, three decades now and has managed to remain relevant and maintain a successful career to this very day. I seriously doubt that in 20-30 years we are going to remember bands like Linkin Park and Cold. AC/DC forever!are going to remember bands like Linkin Park and Cold. AC/DC forever!
B00004XOWM|1.0|yeah this album blows.  i cant believe the opening track.  fred tries to say the f word as many times as possible. now that is deep, real intellectual.  yeah if anyone gave this album any stars i think they would change their minds with time.  i will admit &quot;significant other&quot; was good, gulp gulp, for about two weeks.  cant wait to hear the new album, maybe he can go on tour with sugar ray after. ( no offense sugar ray ).<br />used and new from $1.79    hahaha
B00003CXB4|5.0|If you or your kids love The Lion King, Disney has produced another of their extraordinary DVD ensembles, jam packed with goodies, games, interactive stuff, cut songs and scenes and loads of other extras.<br />Oh, and by the way, the movie is presented in a beautiful, crisp, transfer with Disney Enhanced Theatre Surround Sound that makes for a remarkable home viewing experience. <br />I won't bother to review the film.  If you love it, you will love this DVD.  If you don't care for it, then don't bother.  Disney is to be congratulated, again, on putting a great deal of thought, creativity, and new work into these kid-friendly packages.  Worthwhile family entertainment.
0780626494|4.0|I've seen this film a lot of times, more than I'd care to admit to, and I never tire of it. The first five minutes are pretty dull, so I tend to skip past them, as it really starts when the plane crashes into the house.<br />Christopher Walken & Sissy Spacek are the perfect people to play Brendan Fraser's parents, both as quirky as each other. Sissy plays the perfect wife, drinking to escape her husband and life below ground. Christopher is perfect as the Dad, teaching his son everything he knows.<br />Alicia Silverstone is kooky, \\"psychic\\", and is a perfect match for Adam's character, and of course she has to be called Eve. How original.<br />Troy's character is brilliant, playing the stereotypical gay guy, which Adam thinks means \\"happy\\". Troy and Eve live together, and have a very similar relationship to Will & Grace in the TV show. The girl who has a gay guy for a roommate - tell me, how many times has that been done?<br />The first fifteen minutes go quickly through the first 35 years of Adam's (Brendan Fraser) uneventful life, cutting back and forth between what's going on above the family.<br />I couldn't imagine anyone else in the part of innocent Adam, apart from Brendan. He comes out with the funniest expressions! He is brought up to be the perfect gentleman - opening doors for women, calling them ma'am, doing all those things, the guy who every girl would like but then quickly get fed up of!<br />Some parts of the film aren't explained, leaving you wondering how they had enough supplies to last 35 years, how none of them got seriously ill, until the dad does twenty minutes in, forcing Adam to go up into the big bad world, and how the money hasn't changed in 35 years!<br />The funniest bits of the film are when Adam talks to complete strangers, in his off-hand way. The best sequence in the whole film is The Mask-reminiscent dance scene, when Adam goes to a club and dances with the two women. It's very similar to when Jim Carrey & Cameron Diaz dance together in The Mask; both are great & memorable. And like any dance scenes in films (Grease, The Mask, Saturday Night Fever) the crowd instantly makes a circle around the main people dancing and watches them. This wouldn't happen in real life, so why do they keep repeating this in films?<br />The storyline is pretty predictable: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, and boy gets girl back.<br />There aren't many extras on the DVD. There are trailers; cast & crew biographies; deleted scenes and a B-roll. They're your basic extras - not worth watching more than once, if you can last through them. According to the back of my DVD, there's a \\"Love Meter\\" but I can't find it amongst the extras so god knows where it is.<br />This is definitely for sentimental fools, like me, who love a good romance, and think Brendan Fraser is so cute - just not when he sings!ether in The Mask; both are great & memorable.

B00004SVID|3.0|Pulse and Delicate Sound of Thunder are better.  A video of this would have added to the experience.  A good live album though.
B00006WKY9|5.0|1st let me say this, &quot;Taken By Force&quot; is an essential Metal Classic. Unfortunately this was lead guitarist Uli Jon Roth`s last studio album with the band. He left shorly after due to artistic and creative differences.<br />The sound quality and production on the Japanese remaster is excellant! You can hear everthing. Klaus Miene`s vocal`s are powerful and emotive. This was drummer Herman Rarebell`s 1st album with the band and is probably his best performance as well . Uli`s flawless technique and style(Neo-Classical + Hendrix) always amazes me!<br /> Whether it be the simmering power ballad &quot;W`ill Burn The Sky, the commercial hard rockin &quot;He`s A Woman, She`s A Man&quot; or the classic premetal shred of &quot;Sails Of Charron&quot;, this is a band at the top of their game and ready to take the next step up to international success and fame.<br />This album was a turning point for the Scorpions and showed the musical direction that the band would take thru out the next decade.<br />Any later day fan of the Scorpions who hasn`t checked out their earlier RCA albums yet would do well to start here!

B00008H2LB|5.0|Let's face it, this album is not Hybrid Theory. Though some of the tracks have the HT sound and could have very well been placed on that album, they can't fit any better than on Meteora.<br />01. Foreword -- This had to have its own track for what reason?<br />02. Don't Stay -- Could be put into comparison with 'Papercut', not bad but not great, solid song that flows pretty well. (7/10)<br />03. Somewhere I Belong -- Not the best song LP has put out there but the intro makes it all fall into place, very different from HT material. (7/10)<br />04. Lying From You -- Finally, Brad creates a riff catchy enough to make this one great. The lyrics stand out on this track, translate it however you want, it just works on so many levels. (9/10)<br />05. Hit The Floor -- I didn't like this one when I first heard it, but it tends to grow on you. As much as I hate referring back to HT, had this song been made during that time, I'm pretty sure it could've been put on there, it just has that sound. The flow of the track is a bit slow but the chorus just hits you right in the face. (8/10)<br />06. Easier To Run -- Sounds great live..... horrible on the album. I was really dissapointed that the heavy drumline by Rob wasn't put before every other instrumental. I loved this song when I heard it live and to hear it in a different way on the studio recording just doesn't do it for me anymore. (4/10)<br />07. Faint -- Possibly the best song on the album. It's just so unique and different from anything we've heard from LP, the beat is just so quick and the vocals match it the entire way through...great video too. (10/10)<br />08. Figure.09 -- I would say this is among the most catchiest on Meteora, but not the most outstanding. I would never skip it and it's worth the listen but after a while it can get old. (7/10)<br />09. Breaking The Habit -- Now this is a track worth listening to, the 10-piece orchestra payed off because it's very serene and 'beautiful' for a lack of a better word. The meaning behind the song is a bit sketchy, and it's ironic that Mike wanted to write this song for years but he doesn't sing a single word in it. (9.5/10)<br />10. From The Inside -- Love the intro, could be compared with a mix between 'Crawling' and 'Pushing Me Away'. Not bad. (8/10)<br />11. Nobody's Listening -- The track I usually always skip because I don't see where this fits in with the rest of the album. The instrumental beat is great but the lyrics..so-so. Atleast Chester gets a good part in the chorus. (6/10)<br />12. Session -- Forget 'Cure For The Itch' (10/10)<br />13. Numb -- Possibly 2nd best song on the album, extremely comparative to 'Pushing Me Away', both in song progression and track position. Though it can get old, a listen here and there works just finely. (8.5/10)<br />Meteora: 5/5 stars
B0000541VS|5.0|I loved this movie! As hard as some parts were to watch, it grabbed ahold of me and didn't let go from beginning to end. I have NO idea where this idea of \\"homophobic revenge\\" came from though. Personally I don't think it had anything to do with pedophilia or homosexuality....I think it had to do with power and control. The reviewers who said the boys were out for homophobic revenge....I wonder what they would have called it if it had been young girls or woman getting raped and beat and abused in an institution instead of boys? Anyways, this isn't a movie for people out for something light or fun, this is a movie to make you think and feel, and you WILL feel.
B00005UK1F|5.0|A few months ago, I posted on a few sites asking for the longest songs in the world.  I got a lot of answers - from Dream Theater's &quot;Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence&quot; to Sleep's &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, not forgetting contributions from Iron Maiden, Tool, Type O Negative, Devin Townsend etc etc.  But someone mentioned a song that was just over an hour long by a band called Green Carnation.  It was called &quot;Light Of Day, Day Of Darkness&quot;.  Not being able to find the CD I began downloading it.  I got about 7 minutes of it before a trip to London chanced to reveal the CD to me.  I immediately picked it up (last Friday) and it's been playing ever since.<BR>Simply put, this has got to be one of the very best pieces of music ever written.  Not simply a bunch of songs bundled into one, it's actually one solid piece of pure artistry.  From the crashing guitar and even a brief guttural scream, to the neo-tribal tranquility of a woman's chant, this song can honestly be said to get to your very soul with its multi-levelled, multi-tracked vastness.  Featuring two choirs, a live string arrangement, four vocal contributions, a total of about 50 musicians, and even a music box, the inventiveness and creativity put into LOD,DOD is mind-boggling.  If you never hear another piece of music again, you must hear this.
B000002B30|5.0|My story with Bruce Springsteen's music is quite funny, actually. There was this friend of mine who was absolutely crazy about him. He would play Bruce's records in the car and I would go &quot;Jesus, how can he possibly like that? The guy screams most of the time!&quot;. This was around 1997; I was only 14 years old and didn't know much about music back then.<BR>Then, this year I bought the April issue of Uncut magazine and there was Bruce on the cover. I wasn't interested in reading about him, but I decided to listen to the record that came with the magazine, with Bruce's songs sung by various artists (Ed Harcourt, Heather Nova, The Hollies, etc.) and I just thought to myself: &quot;Hey, this is GOOD!&quot;. <BR>I travelled abroad recently and I got this &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;. OK, I know that compilations are always controversial, but I think this one is a good introduction to Bruce's work and it has wonderful songs such as &quot;Born To Run&quot;, &quot;Thunder Road&quot;, &quot;Dancing In The Dark&quot; and &quot;The River&quot;. There are some nice songs missing, like &quot;Growing Up&quot; and &quot;Lucky Town&quot;, but this is no serious fault, in my opinion. It still is a good overview of Bruce's career and it shows what a great songwriter he is. &quot;The River&quot; almost brought me to tears, with its story of lost innocence and lost dreams; same thing with &quot;Streets of Philadelphia&quot;. His songs about escaping (and this is one of Bruce's big themes) seem to have been written specially for me. That's what's so nice about Bruce: his songs are ever so honest, so heartfelt, that it's impossible not to relate to them. And it's really hard to find artists like this, isn't it? <BR>Now I find it really funny that I used to think of Bruce as an &quot;all-American dude&quot;  - in the worst possible sense. Actually, many people think just like I did because of his big anthemic songs like &quot;Born In The USA&quot; and stuff like that, but don't let that fool you: &quot;Born In The USA&quot; is a critic to the Vietnam War, and many of Bruce's lyrics are quite introspective. Besides, he's always cared very much about the American working class - he's an &quot;all-American dude&quot; in that sense. And that's not negative at all.<BR>Because of all these things I've written here, Bruce Springsteen is now one of my favorite male singers. I strongly recommend anyone who's interested in nice songs and even nicer lyrics to listen to his work. And this &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; seems to be a good start.
B00008PX8P|4.0|I have always considered Led Zeppelin to be one of the truest Heavey Rock bands of my time who never betrayed their fans by changing their style to keep up with the music trend.<br />I was very dissappointed at the fact that Led Zeppelin allowed the release of the classic concert video \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" in DVD format with such poor sound quality. With this new release, it seems that Jimmy Page and Co. realized their sin and made an effort to make amends with their fans. After seeing this Gem of a video I can forgive you Jimmy and Co.!<br />Though this video does not offer a complete concert, this does take you through a historical journey through the prime of their touring days. The video shows clips of performances from Royal Albert Hall (1970),Madison Square Garden (1973),Earls Court (1975), and Knebworth (1979),  my favorites being from Royal Albert Hall.<br />The band performs many of my favorite songs such as the great Stairway to Heaven, Kashmir, Whole Lotta Love, Black Dog, Communication Breakdown, What is and What Should Never Be, Rock and Roll and many other Led classics.<br />As you can see from my favorites, I am very into the heavy side of Zep's music which brings me to the audio quality of this DVD set.<br />The DVD offers 3 different sound formats:<br />L-PCM (Stereo)<br />Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound<br />DTS 5.1 Surround Sound<br />As a rock fan, I believe that great rock should be heard loud and clearly, so I choose to listen to this in DTS format and man does the sound production deliver. Listening to Plant's classic rock voice, Page's great guitar work along with Bonham's classic metal drums and not to forget JP Jone's underrated (by some) bass playing, almost make you feel like the DVD is taking you back in time and you are actually at these concerts.<br /><br />For you youngsters who want to know what true heavy rock is about,check out this video.
B000069CWE|5.0|This is what a remix album sounds like. Amongst the many times other artists have tried to put their songs to a different beat and get featured guests, this is the only one that's worked.<BR>LP completely ripped apart every song they had and put it back in the form of something amazing, every track is proof.<br />The tracks that stand out: 'P5HNG ME A*WY', 'WTH&gt;YOU', 'BY_MYSLF', and 'KRWLNG'. I mean talk about making a song 10000 times better. I found myself questioning these in hysteria because they were just that different, that effective, and that good.<br />It's almost impossible to express the stroke of genius that this album represents.
B000059PQQ|2.0|I have never in my life been more confused by a movie. The title I selected for this review was intoned somberly by mystical guru Marlon Brando. As I couldn't sum the movie up better myself, I therefore selected the quote as representative of the quality dialogue found in 'Candy.' If you watch this movie, you will know what I mean.<br />I am actually quite a fan of campy and strange films, and enjoy plotlines gone wildly astray (think 'Red Zone Cuba' here, for instance), but this takes it to a whole new level, that being the level of having no identifiable plot whatsoever to begin with. I watched this movie twice, and was still trying to figure it out when it was done the second time. It is, evidently, a coming of age fable/parable about Candy, a lovely young woman played by Ewa Aulin.<br />The general operating concept here seems to be pitting Candy against any number of totally unsuitable middle age suitors, and hilarity (in theory) ensues. First there is the John Astin father figure with an electrical outlet in his head (into which a radio playing Steppenwolf is often plugged) who desperately needs a complex surgery performed by James Coburn, who is quite mad. Other potential trysting partners include Walter Matthau as an insane paratrooper, Ringo Starr as a Mexican Gardner, and my personal favorite, Richard Burton, as a scenery chewing poet who has lines like this: &quot;The wind whipped strawberry passion of my fractured spleens.&quot;<br />Two stars for the supporting cast alone. The execution here is quite dismal courtesy of director Christian Marquand. If you want to have a rather bad headache or are possibly under the influence of hallucinogenic substances, this movie is perfect for you.
B00006BTCA|5.0|most music these days is transparent. give these guys a chance and you'll be glad you did.
6303402348|5.0|...and so Tom Hanks did in the movie &quot;Forrest Gump.&quot;  This 1996 film has to be the best epic of all times.  Not only did it win an Academy Award for Best Actor (Tom Hanks), and Best Director (Robert Zemeckis), but also Best Picture, plus three other Academy Awards.  This film starts off in a small southern town, where Forrest grows up.  Next it takes us through three decades of Forrest's life, from the 1950's through the 1980's.  It show's Forrest, who happens to be a really fast runner, as a college football player, a vietnam soldier, a ping pong champ, a shrimp boat captain, and a man in love with his childhood friend Jenny (Robin Wright).  Oh and did I forget to mention that it also portrays him as a hippy!  I give this movie five stars because it has managed to include action, love, comedy, a little bit of history, and a whole lot of heart and soul.  Are you looking for a movie that's &quot;like a box of chocolates (you never know what you're going to get?&quot;  If so then you will love all 142 minutes of &quot;Forrest Gump.&quot;
B00005JM02|5.0|I remember the magic surrounding the first movie I was taken to see. I knew at the time it was something special. Even now, every time the lights dim, I feel that same magic. I wanted to create the same experience for my son's first cinema experience. I was choosy about the movie and am happy that we were not dissapointed by Finding Nemo. My 3 1/2 year old son enjoyed popcorn and High-C while taken to a far away place. We both enjoyed the feature and I'm glad there weren't any questionable moments in the movie. Watching him enjoy the big-boy experience of a fascinating movie in a theatre was a double treat for me. Thank you Pixar for letting G movies be for kids and parents and helping me create a little magic for my little boy.<br />Brenda
B0000AXM3Q|3.0|It's just that, basically it has the same sound in every way to Maidens last studio album, but, it seems to be alot more sloppy in the vocals. And, to top things off, instrumentally it basically copies there last album to the last note!
B00008GKEG|5.0|This is MUST HAVE if you like Beatles music. This is the whole enchalada from beginning to the end. It is well presented and includes all the hits and the background information too. This is the only Beatles DVD you will need to get. This is one of the best music DVD's on the market.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Love it. Great music. It's right up there with some of my other favourite soundtracks, Edward Scissorhands and Lord of the Rings. Really great sound, it suited the movie so well. Soundtracks like those really 'make' a movie. I reccommend it.
B00006AG5N|1.0|Let's see, another compilation of the same dozen or so Elvis Presley songs that we've all heard ad nauseum a million times. Uh huh, uh huh. Only in America could a hillbilly named &quot;Elvis&quot; with a gnat's IQ mumble his way to the status of icon. Do any of you delusional Elvis fanatics out there realize that Presley had an intelligence quotient---no fooling---on the level of an imbecile? This is fact, not hyperbole. Do any of you idol worshipping nitwits realize that your hero Elvis bathed only once a week? How about the fact that he dated fourteen year old girls and married one beehive-headed bird who was only sixteen? Any other guy would have been arrested for statutory rape. That could have been your own daughter, you braindead fools. Or doesn't morality apply where the great Elvis is concerned? What did you find so appealing about this grunting cartoon whose vocabulary didn't transcend monosyllabic grunts? Was it his face-encircling sideburns? His eighteen inch high pompadour? Or perhaps it was his sequined Liberace outfits that exploded on stage as a result of his obesity? I know! It was his sophisticated singing style...his superb breath control.... his romantic ability at turning a beautiful lyric (i.e., &quot;You Ain't Noth'n But A Hound Dog&quot;). Yes, that must be it...you fell in love with the sophisticated, romantic lyrics of his songs. This love blinded you to his redundant three chord, twelve bar juvenile delinquent tunes and his embarrassingly ludicrous B movies with those classy, deeply allegorical titles like &quot;Tickle Me,&quot; &quot;Girls, Girls, Girls,&quot; and &quot;Kiss'n Cousins.&quot; Last but not least, I'm sure the reason you pea brains worship at the alter of a moronic hillbilly child-molesting drug addict is because you share Elvis's affinity for fried peanut butter and banana sandwiches! Oh, okay...now I get it! It's like: &quot;Hey, ya'll, let's grab us a six-pack, get a new tattoo, and drive the pick up over to the Wrasslin'match. We can listen to the almighty king Elvis on our eight track. Uh huh, uh huh.&quot; Don't you unsophisticated low lifes realize what a nontalented nitwit Elvis was---and even worse---what bottom-of-the-barrel self-esteem you must possess in order to call this idiot &quot;king?&quot; Have you no self-worth, Bubba? Now pass me some more of that sweet potato pie! Crosby could sing. Sinatra could sing. Ella Fitzgerald could sing. Elvis? Well, he did have the highest hair and largest belly of all singers. That must count for something. Uh huh, that's the truth, Bubba.
B00009ATIX|4.0|SPOILER ALERT<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! To me, this was not about love or death, rather it hinted at the posssibilites of future technology and provided just one example of its consequences.<br />The idea that humans being replicated is not absurd, and its not based on magic or miracles. Whilst cloning is replication through genetic engineering another technology that has recently been in the spotlight is Nanotechnology. As I understand it, nanotechnology is the chemical process of putting atoms side by side to create any object that is desired. Everything that exists is made up of various atoms arranged in unique shapes and structures. With nanotechnology we could change coal to diamond by simply altering the chemcial structure couldnt we? In time, we could replicate anything and anyone. Sub-atomic self replicating robots putting together atoms to create or repair anything that we desire. So is that what Solaris is. An alien life form with the ability of nanotechnology. Maybe the alien life form is those tiny sub atomic robots. <br />The second concept that the movie plays with is memory. You would be surprised how inaccurate our memory is. How 12 years ago I remember my mate wearing an orange T-shirt to my party but in fact it was red. Our retrieval of information from our memory bank is not perfect. And so Clooney's wife was a product of what he remembered... a suicidal woman. And thats what she kept doing. It is in the end when he realises how wrong his memory had served him... that her suicide was a spontaneous and impulsive act after he had left her. And hence she returns not suicidal in the end. <br />So in my eyes, those self replicating robots now reached earth ... and who knows what would happen from there. <br />So.. what is life... just a bunch of atoms in a particular arrangement. Psychological, social and physical existence of a human are just all atoms arranged in a particlular order. (And if you played around with the arrangement you could convert someone into another known arrangement like gold, diamond or dirt.
B00001ZWBQ|5.0|If you like the Bee Gees this is a MUST HAVE and the only dvd you will need. Excellent performance of all their hits. Both audio and visual quality is excellent.
0316776963|5.0|Funny, charming, and heartwarming. I laughed. I cried. It was better than Cats. Sedaris has been around and these stories are testament to the freakish family members and miserable jobs that are part of his life. I was cautioned by one trustworthy book-loaning friend of mine, &quot;It's just not that funny. He's not the same in print as on NPR.&quot; Well I say, &quot;To hell with that.&quot; The stories aren't all pee-in-your-pants-laugh-till-you-cry funny, but they do make me smile.<br />Furthermore, Sedaris has a knack for setting a mood, even though it's mostly his own mood that we share. Buy it. Read it. I told you so.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Thanks Johnny. Rest in peace.
B000069AUI|5.0|Cold play is one thoes band you never get tired of hearing. You can listen to the whole CD without feeling you've wasted your money, becuase your only going to listen to two songs on the whole cd. Every song ,every cord every verse seems to fit some kind of mood. Some of them make you want to weep, while other make you want to go out and punch something. Chris Martin is a Pisco of music. He makes his words his, sounds a ture art that you can almost see. This is a band your going to hear about years and years from.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|This is one of the best music DVD's on the market at this time. Both the sound quality and the visual/video is excellent. If you like Cher this is the only DVD you will need. This is a no-brainer five star which reviews four decades of her music.
B00005JLSE|4.0|Permit me 2 be a bit historic. Thanks 2 big-budget-muliti-length musical overkill 1968-73 with non-singing actors in leading roles  - the musical genre KILLED itself by the mid 70s...<br />This is 2003 and recently we have experienced Evita, Little Voice, Moulin Rouge and NOW - Chicago.<br />The film has borrowed a lot in style from Bob Fosse`s CABARET 1972. There are killer moments such as Cell-Block Tango and Roxy`s Press Conferance.<br />BUT; to put Catherine and Renee in high profiled musical roles has its short comings. Cathy may have played the West End a decade ago, but her high kicks simply isn`t enough. She can be played down by any number of talented musical stars in Europe and the US. Renee? She is NOT a sexpot! Period! She tries valiantly and has her moments; but it really should have been a Marilyn Monroe-type.<br />Critics hail this as the biggest thing! Have they gone mad? Have dare they compare this with the MGM greats 1939-1958, Busby Berkeley, Judy Garland, The Sound of Music, Mary Poppins, Bob Fosse, Barbra Streisand and the Minnellis? These products, artists and creators are of legendary fame and DESERVEDLY so...<br />Cbicago IS IMPORTANT, and of good work. But a masterpiece? The only reason THE PIANIST(about horrors during World War II) lost at the Academy Awards was the times... The Iraque-\\"crisis\\". Naturally a musical was rewarded and not the horrors of a war...This is how it has always been! People don`t want 2 sorrows of war when their in the midst of it. By do u think musicals flourished in the 30s(th Depression), the 40s(The World War 2) and 60s?(Vietnam)????<br />Chicago is a satiricial product and has important statements; but PLEASE let us have REAL musical stars in these films. PLEASE!
B0000BYM3K|3.0|The cover is bowling shoe-ugly, but Dance of Death will not dissappoint hard-core Maiden fans, as there is little variation from their successful formula. However, listening to it almost gave me a sense of Deja Vu. Throughout the album's 11 tracks I kept running into recycled bits and pieces of songs that Maiden have done before, in particular, the intro to &quot;No More Lies&quot; sounds an awful lot like the Clansman, and Face in the Sand's intro sounds a lot like &quot;Blood Brothers&quot;. Paschendale could have been taken from the X-Factor; put Blaze Bayley on vocals and I wouldn't have been able to tell which album that song was from.  <br />After hearing about the brilliance that was &quot;Paschendale&quot; I suppose I was expecting too much from it. It's a solid song, but doesn't really go anywhere, as if it's stuck in 2nd gear. (Consider Rime of the Ancient Mariner, and it's arrangement, then contrast that to Paschendale's inability to move beyond the same intro/riff for virtually 8+ minutes.)<br />There are some killer tracks here, however. Rainmaker is a great radio-friendly rocker with a catchy chorus and intro. Journeyman is a very introspective, softer piece with Bruce still sounding fantastic and emotional on vocals. All in all, Iron Maiden's consistency is astonishing considering how long they've been at it, but you have to wonder what they would be capable of if they took a few more risks.  <br />For reference, I feel Brave New World was the superior album. <br /> <br />-.5 star for the disaster of a cover<BR>-1 star for recycled bits &amp; &quot;Age of Innocence&quot; <br />3.5 stars
B000002LEE|5.0|Nothing'sShocking is what i think rock is all about: it's raw, powerfull, fresh, cutting edge. I don't know any rock album released in the past 20 years that is more exciting than this one. <BR>&quot;Blood Sugar&quot;, &quot;Nevermind&quot; and &quot;Appetite&quot; are all great but this one's got to be the greatest. Listen to it full volume...if you are a rock fan but you don't like this album then there is something wrong somewhere...<BR>Despite Jane's were the best of their era, they were the only one among all the am rock bands that emerged during the late 80's/ early 90's that never met the mainstream success. It doesn't bother me at all, actually this makes them even cooler.Jane's Addiction are one of the very few bands/artists that had such an impact on me that they actually influenced my personality... <BR>The same goes with Nothing's Shocking : I first listened to this album 2 years ago and it has since become a part of my life....
B00008PX8P|2.0|I would rate this 2 stars as the visual/video component is very weak and looks ancient (30 years old) when compared to dvd's with today's technology. This is heavy duty hard rock with some classics like Stairway to Heaven, Rock and Roll and Whole Lotta Love. Unfortunately, with recordings 30 years old, they did not have the benefit of today's high technology which makes it not as visually interesting as the five star dvd's (like Rolling Stones, Cher Farewell Tour, Eagles, Beatles Anthology, Fleetwood Mac, U2).
B00005N83M|1.0|Would someone just tell this ghetto chick to just stick to dancing.This woman cant sing or act,so stick to dancing jennifer.All the songs sound the same and are very boring.The im real theme in her songs is getting very old and annoying.Who is she trying to fool by venturing into hip hop and featuring all hip hop rappers?Just another commercial ploy to make more money off of alot of trendy and simple minded people out there.Sooner or later this woman will get exposed as being all about image and none about musical ability.DONT BUY THIS CD!!!
0446608955|5.0|I've just put down and finished reading A Walk to Remember and I just had to write something somewhere telling someone to read it. I've thought of reading this book back then--thinking that if the movie was good, the book would be astounding--but didn't really get to doing so. This week though, my English teacher passed out a list of five books wherein we could choose one, find a way to get that book and be done reading it by the 27th of October. So I went to the library after school today and got the book. I told myself I'd peek inside and close it again, promising myself that I won't breeze through it so fast. So I peeked... read the prologue... nodded at the warning in it and reluctantly grabbed myself a box of tissues--thinking that I probably won't use it anyway. I read... and never stopped. Right now, about 10 minutes after finishing the book, my eyes are bloodshot, swollen and are stinging so bad. It was a great read. A must-read actually. I seriously was hanging onto every word. <BR>Now, I've decided that tomorrow, I'll march back to the library and get myself all the available Nicholas Sparks books. I'll read them fast and go back here, hopefully giving out some more stars.
B000099T2L|5.0|This c.d. is H O T !! I can listen to her c.d. all day. Seriously she is very talented and I love her songs..very sexXxy and sweet, others you can dance too..and this cd will get you in the mood as soon as you hear it! :) You wont get bored, and I love her style!
B00006LWSF|5.0|Ok you saw the above title in many other reviews (i think!) and now you sort of think that the only good reviews are the ones with a one or two star \\"cuz they make sense\\"!! But damn, don't you realise?! we're talking about a soundtrack which a a legendary emcee: Rakim together with \\"White Pac\\"-Eminem who will surely will be a legend together with others. The fact that there are these two emcees together is already a big deal!! Then you have the \\"prince\\" emcees like Nas and 50 Cent!! How can u dare say that this soundtrack is wack?!! Eminem's got 3 excellent songs with great flow an lyrics which can be greatly associated with the film. In my opinion his best one is \\"8 Mile\\" !! Rakim's got his very own original flow in almost every song that he makes, and even in \\"R.A.K.I.M.\\" !! His lyrics will make you hypnotized!!! 50, as a new-comer in the Shady family, has two solos and two collaborations (with D-12 in \\"Rap Game\\", and with Obie Trice an Eminem in \\"Love Me\\")!!He's amazing cuz he's got serious themes in his lyrics but the way he relates them is quite humourous so it keeps you interested!! Nas made his imprint in the rap game with his debut \\"Illmatic\\" which undoubtley is a classic, in \\"U Wanna Be Me\\" he disses Jay-Z, which is the only thing that bothers me about Nas, but if you forget this fact, Nas is another great lyricst although he ain't funny like his \\"cousin\\" 50! Nas is an honest rapper and presents you reality whether you like it or not, and that is what makes me admire him!! The rest of the songs are quite good especially Xzibit's \\"Spit Shine\\" and Obie's \\"Adrenaline Rush\\" which are both gritty!! To add a bit of a different flavour Macy Gray and Boomkat each have song in the soundtrack which are ok, especially Macy's happy song \\"Time Of Your Life\\"! Now I saw a review that said that you can't label any rapper as great; \\"elvis was great\\", \\"santana was great\\"!!! But man, just because rappers don't \\"sing\\" it doesn't mean they don't have talent!!! I'm neither gonnasay that Rakim's better than Santana, nor I'm gonna say the contrary!! They are from a totally different type of music!! Rakim specialises in lyrics an tries to create an original FLOW of WORDS, Santana specialises in the classic and electric guitar in the Latino music, and tries to create an original FLOW of MUSIC!! And about profinaty??!! One thing: RAPPERS ARE ALL PRACTICALLY HONEST!!!!! They ain't gonna hide anything that they didn't learn from the streets!!!! And whoever is sayin that Eminem is the only good emcee in the cd is wrong!! Eminem is ONE of the best but NOT THE best!!! And it's a clear fact!!!
B000021YQV|1.0|The music critics that hail Serj Tankian as a great thinker and poet must have a brain about the size of a peanut.  This is supposed to be poetic and socially-conscious?  Well, sure the system isn't perfect, but if they hate it so much, they are more than free to go back to whatever third-world pit they came from.  All they're doing is making absolutely awful &quot;music&quot; with no orchestration, minimal talent, and stupid lyrics.  Okay, so there are three or four songs that are listenable.  The rest is just noise.  Nothing more, nothing that a fifth-grader couldn't do.  This is the epitome of why nu-metal is a gargantuan load of defecation.  It's music by drug fiends, for drug fiends, in a similar vein as rap is.  The American music industry is all too willing to shove garbage like this down people's throats, but they never give any kind of attention to talented bands, even American artists like Iced Earth.  No, we have to listen to three idiots yelling and screaming over shambled noise about why they hate the government and why their lives are a waste.  And there are people out there who find this to be good music.  That's what I call closed-mindedness and poor taste.  I'm all for people's choice in music, but I honestly don't understand what one can find entertaining about this horse dung.
B00003000M|4.0|this is a kind of response to mr. tj from Portland who wrote that every true Marley fan will be disappointed with this album. I really disagree. I have been listening to ska and reggae for years and have various albums from Bob, Peter Tosh, Skatalites and many others. I find this cd brilliant except for one fact -&gt; there's no reggae on it. Anyway, Rebel Music remix is sooo outstanding just like Johnny Was a Good Man or Jammin'. It's a great way to connect the younger audience listening to hip hop with that good old reggae. And if Bobby was alive, I'm sure he'd approve ...
B000009EAD|5.0|I got into Iced Earth on the advice of a friend, and this was one of my first albums by the band.  It's a spectacular display of how metal should be made.  No hip-hop-style programming, nothing to overpower the guitars, and magnificent musicianship.  Jon Schaffer is a musical genius.  There are more mellow songs on here than any other Iced Earth album that I can think of, but in contrast to others, the softer stuff on here is very well-executed, demonstrating Iced Earth's versatility.  The vocals of Matt Barlow are half the fun of listening to it, as he sounds absolutely possessed in many of the songs.  Not much more I can say, except get this album.  And make sure you pick up my personal favorite, Burnt Offerings, as well!

0321012542|5.0|Bevington's edition is by far the best Complete Works of Shakespeare available today. Why? First and most important, the footnotes give you just what you need to understand the play and no more. They're complete, concise, and accurate. The formatting of the footnotes also facilitates their accessibility. Second, the introductions to individual plays are marvelous--they get right to the most important critical issues that make reading the plays interesting, without being vague and out-of-date or pedantic, overly concerned with trivial minutiae. Third, the background essays are excellent and up-to-date. The essays on &quot;The Drama Before Shakespeare,&quot; &quot;London Theaters and Dramatic Companies,&quot; &quot;Shakespeare's Life and Work,&quot; and &quot;Shakespeare's Language&quot; are among the best available anywhere, complete and concise, giving you exactly the information that is needed for studying and appreciating Shakespeare in the 21st century, without bogging down in unnecessary details. Consider also Bevington's The Necessary Shakespeare, which uses the same footnotes, introductions, and background essays, but includes fewer plays. It's possible to quibble with some of the editorial decisions, but unless you're writing a Ph.D. dissertation on Shakespeare, students and aficionados will want a good &quot;reading edition&quot; like the Bevington that includes the important variants. If you really want a completely &quot;authentic&quot; 17th century version, folio reproductions are now widely available.
B00005JLWN|5.0|This movie is my favorite movie of all time. Now you are probably wondering that I am crazy but I am not. This movie is a must see movie. When the matrix came out I was soo syked about seeing it but after I seen this movie I dont want to go see the 3rd matrix. This movie is crazy with the fighting scenes and the story plot are a deadly combination. Though at a point the story gets slow, but it actually helps because it makes you understand whats all that is going on. The fighting scenes are new and different but to be honest when people think its a matrix copy I get offended because its not! its one of those high-low budget films that never came out in theaters but its one of the best movies. And if you think you wont watch it because its on the high-low budget film dont let that fool you I highly recommend this movie to own and to view! Plus Christian Bale is one of the sweetest actors. Basically overall say bye bye to Keanu Reeves say hello to Christian Bale u Rock!
B00005JKZV|5.0|I thought this was superb - the acting was magnificent, the scenery was breathtaking and apart from a few liberties from the Tolkien original (presumably to meet changing times....) it was altogether fully up to expectation.

B000028U0Y|5.0|Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison is the best example of why Johnny Cash had so many fans.  This album is simply raw and honest.  Recorded live at the famous California prison in 1968 it contains songs about life behind bars, going to the death chamber, a man's love for his mother, and a couple of comedy tunes.<br />In the background you can hear the normal noises of a prison, the heavy iron doors clanging shut, excited whoops from men who didn't get any entertainment, and dozens of other sounds.  These sounds and the trembling bass of Johnny Cash give this album a feel of being free and trapped at the same time.  The music itself is simple and straight-forward.  There's no fancy production techniques used here.  Just a few microphones plugged into a reel-to-reel machine catching the emotion of the concert.<br />This album has a few of Cash's early hits (Folsom Prison Blues, I Still Miss Someone, Orange Blossom Special) but it's not really notable for those tunes.  What makes this album special is the overall performance.  It's full of Cash's heart and emotion, a genuine affection for the men in his audience.  <br />There are other albums out there that have more of his hits but none have more of his presence.  This is the perfect jumping on point for a late comer to the Johnny Cash bandwagon.

B0000BYM3K|2.0|This album sounds almost exactly like Brave New World. <br />Long Gone is the creative Cover Art. <BR>Gone is the hard sounding edge from the 80's. <BR>Long gone is the high effort they put into recordings. <BR>Long gone is the high quality writing, power guitar solo's. <BR>Long gone is the 'Great' Iron Maiden. <br />I am hugely disappointed.
B00005OWEG|4.0|Alright. One of the best films ever. My personal favorite Coppola film. But the new Redux version has scenes in it that drag and scenes I love. For example. In the original the last thing you hear from Colonel Kilgore is the legendary &quot;I love the smell of napalm in the morning&quot; speech. It leaves such an impression on you and it's a great way to end the scene. In Redux it goes on with Kilgore realizing that the napalm was blowing the wind off shore thus not giving Lance good surfing waves. Anyway it ends up with Willard stealing Kilgore's surfboard. It a hilarious scene and it lets you see Willard being at ease with those around him. You actually see him smile unlike in the original. So either way on that scene.<br />Anyway here's a question for those who go on about the French Plantation sequence. Remember the Sampan massacre. Willard was so set on getting to Kurtz that he murders a Vietnamese woman. &quot;I told you not to stop. Now let's go&quot; he tells chief. Well if he killed someone so he could get on with his mission. Why was it okay to stop and have dinner with the French?

B000002JSN|5.0|When I started listening to Led Zeppelin, this is where I began. It rivals even Led Zeppelin IV, their career-defining record containing Stairway to Heaven, their most accoladed song. Here are my ratings:<br />1. Custard Pie: A great opener. Will make anyone's foot tap. The scratchy, howling guitar pefectly matches Robert's hoarse voice. (8.5/10)<br />2. The Rover: Zep's last real hippie song. It describes the materialistic, plundering nature of humans, pleading for us to 'just hold hands.' The beginning is deceptive and slow, but the song climaxes into a passionate chorus. (7/10)<br />3. In My Time Of Dying: A tune that was modelled after the early song, 'Jesus Make Up My Dying Bed.' The drums are great, and the warbling guitar adds to Robert's wonderful singing. Don't put it down after 2 minutes; about halfway into the song is a great, seismic piece that you'll be humming all day. Would be perfect if it wasn't long enough to be impractical. (9/10)<br />4. Houses of the Holy: A cheerful, poppy song that lifts the mood of the disc. However, it's not a personal favorite and is too cheerful for my liking. (6/10)<br />5. Trampled Underfoot: Will get your feet tapping! The clavinet lick at the beginning is barely audible but gives way to awesome, head-bobbing drumming and a very catchy riff. Perfect! (10/10)<br />6. Kashmir: The best song on the CD. I always listen this one through. Q magazine said it 'sounds like the last dinosaur walking up the path.' Inspired by sandy, desertlike Morocco, this track is pure mystique. Very impressive drumming by Bonham as well. (11/10)<br />7. In The Light: A mystic, long, exotic intro-could be inspired by the east just as Kashmir was. This song has a haunted ambience, due partly to the excellent interleaving of keyboard and guitar. (9/10)<br />8. Bron-Yr-Aur: Put me in another world. An entirely acoustic piece, with no drums, bass, or even volcals except for Robert's harmonious note at the end of the song. Inspiring and deep. (7/10)<br />9. Down By The Seaside: A staggering, beachy intro with breezy lyrics and harmonies. Thematically perfect; you can just feel the waves licking your feet. (8/10)<br />10. Ten Years Gone: Epic, underrated. Very deep and stirring. Makes you feel like you're careening through a midnight sky, following the moon. (9/10)<br />11. Night Flight: A clear, fanfaric info that wavers into a bluesy middle. John Paul Jones shows his stuff with the warbling keyboard. (9/10)<br />12. Wanton Song: A bashing song with a catchy riff, but not a special effort on LZ's part. Gives you a headache after a while. (6/10)<br />13. Boogie With Stu: Experts saw it as 'frivolous nonsense', but the rolling, saloon-style piano and banging spoons create a really catchy song nevertheless. (8/10)<br />14. Black Country Woman: Bluesy. It doesn't really fit in<br />much with the other tracks on the CD. Rather, it brings back the feel of Led Zeppelin III's warm, country acoustics. Robert wails about his woman's<br />15. Sick Again: A popular song, but follows in the footsteps of The Rover. Why does it sound SO much like the song? Ah well, Bonham shows his stuff. (7/10)<br />There you have it. The first 6 tracks alone make the record a must-have. Their length may make newbies squirm, but it's well worth it.

B00005JKN9|3.0|A strong and powerful look at the birthing of a city.  Then it goes to - I don't know.  A long movie, which usually doesn't distract me, that seems to rush to an ending that is tacked on.  The detail of the period and its activities as well as social mores is incredible. Well acted for the most part.  Some of the &quot;bit&quot; roles were memorable.  Wouldn't buy it because of the disappointment at the ending but I did sit through it.
0385504209|5.0|I was in a bookstore while on vacation a few weeks ago. The young bookseller became very excited when a woman went to the cash register to purchase a book. The book was The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown. This young man, an aspiring writer himself, loved this book and hoped that he would one day write as clever and masterful a tale as he believed Dan Brown did. I was next in line and he asked me if I had read it. I told him I had started it, and he wondered how I could put it down. I told him there is a very good reason why I could not finish it. The people I love the most, namely my family members and friends are always taking it from me so the can read it. He told me he understood because the book is addictive. The woman purchasing the book could hardly wait to get home and read.<br />It seems as if The Da Vinci Code has caught the interest of many people, and after reading the book, it is easy to see why. Dan Brown tells a masterful tale about a modern day search for the Holy Grail. This is not an ordinary Grail myth story, however. It involves murder, police investigations, and takes the reader into a variety of organizations including the upper echelon of the Roman Catholic Church, Interpol, a secret Swiss bank, Opus Dei, and the Freemasons. A wide variety of well developed characters are found in the story, and throughout the book it is often difficult to tell who is good and who is evil-the story moves so quickly that one can seem to be good and turn out evil, and others go from evil to good.  In the hands of a less skilled author, this could be a distraction, but Brown is able to use this technique to keep the story moving.  Unlike some suspense novels, which often contain one dimensional characters, the reader really begins to care about this novel's characters and sees them as complex people.<br />The book is well researched. Brown seems to know many of the current religious debates, particularly regarding Gnostic writings of the early Church and the controversy surrounding these writings. A person such as Robert Langdon, the main character and a Harvard professor would be in the heat of such a debate since some of the theories in the book are from the research of Harvard scholars. Some readers could find some of Brown's pages heretical, others may wonder if what he has to say is true. Remember, the genre of the book is fiction, and if Brown's theories make you think, it only means he is a gifted writer, not that Christianity is hiding something. If anything, the book views both faith and belief in a positive manner.<br />If you are purchasing this book, read it fast, or better yet, order as second copy just in case your friends and loved ones decide to borrow it and you will have to wait to discover the secrets of this wonderful book.sy surrounding these writings.

B00005JM0B|2.0|I don't understand why this has gotten alot of good reviews. This movie adds nothing new AT ALL to the Terminator story. This was a showcase for Arnold Schwarzeneger to get back into the spotlight for his laughable election campaign. T3 brings back John Anderson,played by Nick Stahl (Why, Oh Why couldn't they have gotten Edward Furlong???), and Claire Danes as John's childhood friend. It appears that another Terminator has been sent to kill John (AGAIN) and \\"AH-nold\\" is sent back (AGAIN) to stop her. Thats right, her. I have nothing at all against a female terminator, but it just seems they made her a woman just so they could say, \\"See!? It's not T2! The Terminator's a woman!\\". But the truth is, this is EXACTLY T2. Yes, there are subtle differences, but not many. And whats even worse is this movie has absolutely no flair at all. The first Terminator movie had the good script. The second Terminator movie had the style. The third Terminator movie has neither. It does have expensive, big action scenes where they destroy a few million dollars worth of stuff, but nothing we haven't seen better action movies do before. T2 had innovative action scenes, such as the chase through the drainage area in the middle of Los Angeles with an 18 wheeler. This movie does involve a chase sequence trying to mimick the drainage scene, but 12 years after T2 this has been done a million times before. The special effects are not special at all, especially after movies like \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" or as a matter of fact, ANY movies to have come out in the past few years. But let me go back to the story. As I was watching this movie, I kept on waiting for some sort shocking revelation to the Terminator world. All of a sudden, this movie just ended. What!?!? I can't believe I paid $6.00 to learn absolutely nothing<BR>new to this story. It just ends suddenly and you leave not knowing much more than you knew coming in. For all the fanatic fanboys out there, YES I know there are some revelations tothe story, but they are small ones. If you are not a fan of the Terminator series and are looking for a good action movie, don't look here. They say there is going to be a T4, but I'm not so sure if I will see it. I'm a fan of the Terminator and I was bored to death. Hasta La Vista \\"AH-nold\\"<br />Recommendations -<br />1. The Lord of the Rings Trilogy - Amazing, classic movies<BR>2. The Matrix Trilogy - The Star Wars of this generation<BR>3. Pirates of the Carribean - Johnny Depp's acting is worth this<BR>movie alone
B00006AG5N|5.0|Shut up,if you don't like an artist keep quiet about them. I personally don't like NSYNC or Britney but I don't go out and write bad reviews of them. Hey,do you like rock? Well,then you can thank Elvis.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I heard Gavin DeGraw first at an online site that previews new music. It was a little rough, but the songs and lyrics stuck with me and I couldn't get them out of my head. I then saw him opening for Sister Hazel. As a performer, he is amazing so I bought his CD there that night. He loves his fans, as he talked to me for a bit and autographed the CD for me. And when I put it on in the car, I wasn't disappointed. It's been in my CD player for a month now, and I normally change CDs daily. His music hits the heart and has captured the way so many of us feel. It's hard to believe he's only 26 with some of the wisdom in his songs. He turned down his first recording contract offer in order to grow as a musician, and if this is what he's turned into, I can't wait for his next CD. Hard to place him in a category as his music is varied, but he reminds me of Billy Joel.
0060090383|5.0|This book is one of the best I've read in a long time. The main character (Rachel) always kept me laughing with her self-depreciating comments, and outlook on life. At times my intestines were in knots, and other times I was crying from laughing so hard. Great book if you just want to have a good time.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|What I don't understand is how can a great band like Maiden put out a sub-par album.They worked on it for two years and came out with this??? Well its not all bad after a few listen's.The first single isn't at all good in my mind.Paschendale would have been my choice for the single. Missing on this album is Steve Harris's trademark bass lines.Production isn't great either.When I first bought the album and put it in my stereo I was [upset] at the lasck of great songs along with catchy chorus. After listening to it more and more, it grows on you.Key tracks for me are......Rainmaker,No more lies,Montsegur,Dance of death and Paschendale.Journeyman is the bands first ever acoustic track and can I say it will be there last.Journeyman sounds as if it was a Bruce Dickinson b-side and they needed and extra song to put on Dance of Death.All in all.Its a good album, but no were near as good as Brave new world.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Sorry, this isn't Slipknot.  This is Iron Maiden.  This album is an incredible followup to Brave New World, one that can't be passed up by anyone with an ounce of imagination or love for metal.  While groups like Metallica &quot;evolve&quot; into complacency and count their money, Maiden evolves their style while still maintaining what has made them the Best. Metal. Group. Ever.<br />I had no idea that BNW was merely the tip of the iceberg as far as what Maiden are capable of now with their current lineup: Dance of Death is so beyond superior to anything that's been released this year its not even a contest...and hey look, guitar solos!<br />From the opening rocker of Wildest Dreams to the closing notes of the thoughtful Journeyman, DoD is loaded with talent, passion, and pure imagination.  I think the production is a bit spotty at times with Bruce's vocals getting run over now and then by the guitars, but there is nothing bad to say about a single track on this album.  And to ANYONE that rips Paschendale...what are you smoking?  Paschendale is the most powerful song they have ever recorded, the visuals it conjurs up are truly stirring.  If you are unable to grasp the mood they are creating with this MASTERPIECE, look up Paschendale to understand the hell that they are telling you about.  <br />And then there's Montsegur for Maiden History part 2 on this album, a song performed seemingly in mockery of those that performed the atrocities against the Cathars.  Note the tongue-in-cheek upbeat tempo to the song to see what I mean.  <br />Bottomline: get this cd.  Its Maiden at their best, and once again them showing everyone else how its done.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|I have to laugh about Amazon pairing this CD with the latest from Metallica, but it actually makes sense.  If you want to hear the difference between a band who knows how to evolve without loosing the qualities that make their music great versus a band that has totally lost its way, buy these two CDs together.  Iron Maiden is one of the very few bands that has not disappointed me by putting out a CD that I had to return after one playing.  If you like anything that Iron Maiden has done in the past you will find a lot to enjoy about the songs on Dance of Death.
0380789035|1.0|AMERICAN GODS wasn't a really bad book.  It was just bad in a plain sort of way.  Built on an interesting, if not new, theory, it started out strong, but didn't have the gas to bring it home.  Midway through the book, I found myself alternately bored, tired and disinterested.  I sighed a lot.  It was hard to finish.<br />I suspect Gaiman threw all the pieces and characters together with no real ties to bind them.  Many, if not most, of the characters had no real purpose except to provide clever dialogue.  I counted thirty-six pages of what were essentially short stories places throughout the book.  Only one of them had a character that showed up againonly to be run down by a limo.<br />Throughout the book Gaiman builds our expectations of a great war between the old gods and the new.  The storm is coming, is constantly repeated.  The Storm Is Coming.  And when the storm finally comes, nothing much happens.  It's like a balloon that goes whooopthpthpth, instead of POP!  And it's not so much that the war never happened, as it was the way it never happened.  Gaiman pulls the proverbial rabbit of his hat.  And it's a stupid-looking rabbit, too.<br />Ho-hum ... or blah.  I don't know which.<br />I might have given it 2 stars if it were shorter, but I'm mad because of all the time wasted.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|Just when you couldn't bare being in school during the week, imagine having to be forced to spend a Saturday there.  That's what happens to five high school students who are forced to spend a Saturday detention together.  None of them have anything in common and none of them are friends.  Each is an opposite from the other.  The group consists of a brain, a prom queen, a jock, a basket case and a trouble-maker.  A unique and unexpected bond is formed by the five teens as the day goes on, with all sorts of different states of emotion going on for each of them.  No matter happens on Monday, all five of them will always that one Saturday together; therefore, forever labeling them &quot;The Breakfast Club.&quot;<br />Not only is this a classic film, it's one of my personal favorites.  I loved it when I was little and I love it now as I am in my twenties.  It's so refreshing to have a brutally honest film that plays on all of your emotions as this movie does.  And even though this was shot in the eighties, people can still relate to it now in 2000.  This is why it is so effective and powerful.<br />The movie is so memorable that you will most likely repeat every single line during each viewing.  The actors do a terrific job of portraying their roles flawlessly.  The script is funny and touching at the same time.  Everything that is shown in the movie is crucial and significant; being that there isn't a single minute in the movie that goes wasted.<br />This new DVD edition, while it may not be the most spectacular of DVDs, is a lot better than the previous version.  They did an excellent job of producing a successful remastered version of the movie that looks and sounds excellent.  You can even watch it in DTS; that is, if your system carries it.  I'm afraid there's not much to offer in the special features department.  It really is a shame, being that this is such a classic movie.  Still, the way the film looks and sounds is worth the price alone.<br />&quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; is a terrific movie that still has the same effect on us as it did years and years ago.  It's funny, tragic, touching and honest.  If you haven't seen this movie yet, please, make sure that the next time you are at a video store that you pick this up and check it out.  You have no idea what you're missing if you don't.  Still a favorite after so many years, this film surpasses so many movies that we see today.

B00006L7XQ|4.0|As one of millions of children who were weened on Johnny Cash, his passing has carved a small chunk out of my heart along with the likes of my other childhood and musical icons.  I began to get back into Mr. Cash only recently with the purchase of American IV and plan on picking up the other American Recordings as well.  As I have read some of the negative reviews that appeared shortly after his death, I am saddened by the need for some to judge people on their past or their tunnel like moral code.  If you didn't like the music, then give the album a poor review.  Simple.  I even agree with some things that were said, Mr. Cash doesn't have much of a range and a lot of power had left him, but as he was struggling with frail health and age that can be forgiven.  I have never doubted his sincerity, his emotion, or his lyrical talent.  There are some artists I feel that should be listened to for reasons other than their voices...Bob Dylan, Tom Waites, Liz Phair, Janis Joplin, etc...(don't jump on me if you love the way these artists sing, I am just saying they aren't going to be asked to sing any arias soon) Mr. Cash gave hope to some prisoners, he did drugs, he drank, he found religion...he was a man, and I believe he was a good man.  This doesn't have any impact on how I view his art, or how I remember my father through his music, or anything else.  I give the album 4 stars because I didn't like all of his songs, but I loved enough, and I regret he won't be around to make more music...at least his legacy is preserved and I have countless albums to enjoy for the rest of my life.
B000028U0Y|5.0|When I heard Johnny Cash had passed away, I was saddened to know his booming baritone would be silent now. I turned on the radio, hoping to catch some fleeting moments of the Man in Black's life in song. Instead, each and every country station (with one or two exceptions) seemed to be going about &quot;business as usual&quot;, with nothing besides a &quot;RIP Johnny&quot; message, no full-fledged celebrations of his music to be found.<br />So I went out and bought Folsom Prison, as I didn't have any Cash records in my collection. Let me just say: I wish I'd gotten this earlier, it's absolutely fantastic. Being in the South, I couldn't help but grow up with country music, but as I got older the modern stuff began to turn into Garth Brooks-like medeocrity dressed up in loud clothes, and I found more substance in the entire body of rock music (from the Sun Studio days to English punk rock). I never thought I'd like country music...until I realized that the older stuff, like Cash and Waylon and Willie, that was the good stuff. The rebels of country music weren't pre-packaged pretty boys who strutted around singing other people's words with the emotion of a too-good-for-my-pants primadonna. These were men who grew up during the Depression, who sang about the hard times, the heartbreak, the loss, the depravity of life.<br />So Johnny Cash and his peers keep me from hating country music entirely, and this (as well as the Oh Brother soundtrack) have found a welcome place in my record collection. RIP Johnny, you will be missed. I couldn't have picked a better record to get to honor your memory.
B00006879E|5.0|I heard about Maroon 5 from my friends. They just raved about them, but all I had heard was the song Harder To Breath. I decided to go ahead and get the album and could not believe what I heard. This CD is incredible. It's one that I put in my player and never have to skip a song. It's catchy with amazing lyrics. Take a chance and GET THIS CD! You will NOT be disappointed.
B00005NWM3|3.0|Nickelback is surfing on the wave of a comeback of Rock/Grunge/Metal music on top charts.album promoted by #1 smash hit &quot;How you remind me&quot; and &quot;Too bad&quot; sold in millions of copies and brought Nickelback a status of definite Rock star...<BR>Why? simply,because Nickelback with their Image of a Hard-rockers (look at Chad Kroeger) went straight into the minds of younger and older pop and Rock fans.People are tired of all the r&amp;b,hip-hop,soul and pop music that rides high on charts.Nickelback propably knew it - and their made their way on the charts with &quot;silver side up&quot;.<BR>The album is not bad - heavy guitars,great production,Chad is a very interesting vocalist - in few words - nothing hurts in here,except that...we have all heard this before.sometimes Nickelback strikes with a Quasi-Tool riff,sometimes they smell like Nirvana or Pearl Jam.a Second hand Grunge-rock.a funny thing is that this specific mix of famous rock bands style made Nickelback their own sound.i remember Nickelback promoting their album &quot;the state&quot; - the band where not so sure of themselves but i felt emotions in some songs...and &quot;Silver side up&quot; is a well polished popular album.without any original ideas and without excitment.a perfect music to drive your car too or to listen at parties.that's today's Nickelback - a new rock stars.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|I love this movie. In fact we watch this movie at every tailgate party. Great, great movie!
B000021YQV|4.0|HAHA thisis a cool cd. Its not allthat deep, but who cares. it doesnt get old, and its fun to listen to. It doesnt sound all that good unless you blast it so loud your floors shake, but when you do, ahh.. you just have to try it. Toxic City, Chop Suey, Needles, And Prision sone are probally my favroite songs on the album. I gave it a 4 cuz im an overy christan person, and dont think 'angels deserve to die' but thats just me. You can hate me for that but i dont really care. Otherwise, this cd is awesome, i liked it more than Steel This Album.
B00005JM1Y|4.0|This is an exciting hilarious comedy. Johnny English could be the total messup of James bond.  Rowan makes this movie so funny.  Star of bean will finally meet bond. <br />This movie is about a guy who tries to save the world and does an impressing but messed up job. If you see this take your kids and they'll have a super blast in this outragious comedy.
B000069AUI|5.0|Though i usually like punk music, i gave this cd a try. I havent listened to the whole thing yet, but i would buy it anywasy. Thes songs are beautiful, and have some of the best piano work of all time. The songs are clean, pure, catchy, and inspiring. After listening to it, you wonder why Cold play isnt as popular as some other artists. Like a good dream, this cd is a breath of fresh air.
B00006L7XQ|4.0|This is the fourth in the series of American Recordings albums, and it's highlights rank among the best that series offers. Be prepared for a dark and gloomy ride through Johnny's reflections on mortality, but also a few touches of his sense of humor. <br />\\"Hurt\\" is undeniably the cornerstone of this album, as it easily ranks with the finest recordings of his career. I've never been a fan of song composer Trent Reznor, always doubting the credibility of songs with lyrics like this, in which a man surveys the ground zero of his life, and talks to his only friend left- addiction. When Reznor wrote it, he was a brash young man recording industrial club hits that came off as arrogant to me at the time, and \\"Hurt\\" was no different. However, I've had to reassess this song now that Johnny has done, and lent the incredible weight of his lifetime of experiences behind it. The convergence of this song and its lyrics with Johnny Cash is a sublime event in the history of popular music, and one not to be missed.<br />Also notable is \\"I Hung My Head,\\" a latter day song by Sting, which hits you with a sucker punch near the equal of \\"Folsom Prison.\\" In fact, this song should be considered a cousin to that song, as if the same person is singing it. <br />\\"First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\" is only the more urgently emotional now that we know both Johnny and his beloved June have passed on. This is such a fine song and lyric, and to hear Johnny render it in such loving tones, it's hard not to jerk a tear.<br />Other highlights include the title track, which is a stirring Cash original of faith under the extreme duress of the apocalypse, \\"In My Life\\" and \\"Tear Stained Letter.\\" I dock the album half a star because of its inclusion of \\"Desperado,\\" a too-obvious modern-day standard that I think Johnny is above having to do at this point in his career. I'm also not sure I need to hear \\"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\\" again, as it's been done a million times, including a few times by Cash himself, though it is nice to hear Cash and his post-modern counterpart Nick Cave sing together.<br />And that sense of humor \\"We'll Meet Again\\" shows up at the end. This is the track I imagine Johnny was prepared to leave us with as the coda to his life and recording career. And, unfortunately, it is. Though he has left us, I know he hurts no more, and his place is with June right now. They both left us too early. I was looking forward to Johnny growing older and getting even better. We'll miss you, Mr. Cash.
0060925000|5.0|I must say that ever since I first read A Suitable Boy in 1995 I have been utterly in love with this book. I've probably driven everyone that I know totally demented telling them how great it is. Despite that, I still continue to sing its praises. I must recommend A Suitable Boy to anyone that appreciates a truly satisfying read. Although I have to warn you, that once you read it you're only going to want to sit down and read it again. But sure, what's wrong with that!?! Anyway there's always An Equal Music, and The Golden Gate to keep you going in between.
0066214122|4.0|This is a novel a lot like andromeda strain in various ways: there are really tiny creatures out to get the heroes, there is a secure environment that is the only thing stopping the tiny creatures from getting the heroes, a couple people die pretty brutally in between the first and last pages, and the book has the most retarding ending, which shouldn't even be called an 'ending.'<br />With that said, as with all the Michael Crichton books I have read (which is almost all of them), I really enjoyed this one (minus the ending).<br />If you want to do something kind of fun, read this book, and then read *Dean Koontz's &quot;By the Light of the Moon&quot;. You could pretend it is a sequel to Prey with new characters and a new location, and that would make up for the ending of Prey.<br />*You will know why after you read both books

B00000JR2A|5.0|While this CD was recorded over 14 years ago the music resonates as powerfully today, perhaps even more than when it was released as it was a bit ahead of its time.  In fact, the songs here seem to fit as easily into the 60's/70's rock and roll era of Pink Floyd, the Beatles and Led Zeppelin as they would into the 80's pop scene or the darker moods of the 90's era. This re-released version has four extra tracks that are worth the effort.<br />Truly representing a wide range of styles starting with the smooth ballad \\"Woman in Chains\\" featuring the soulful voice of Oleta Adams.  The highlights are the following two tracks:  \\"Badman's Song\\", a bluesy jazz number and \\"Sowing the Seeds of Love\\" the hit single inspired by the Beatles better work.  The track \\"Year of the Knife\\" is a powerful rock and roll song.  \\"Famous Last Words\\" and \\"Advice for the Young At Heart\\" round out the single releases. Both are great songs.<br />The extra tracks include a jazz instrumental, and a couple of unique blends of late 80's pop, including a rap version with the \\"Sowing the Seeds\\" lyrics called \\"Johnny Panic\\".<br />I have to say this is among my favorite recordings ever.  From the deep lyrics to the wide range of musical styles, the CD has no weak spots for me.  If all you know of Tears for Fears are top 40 pop hits, then try this one out.  One of the best CDs from any era.
B00006CXXU|5.0|She wrote most of the songs. They alll have meaningful lyrics, real emotion and are sung with a voice that no young pop star today can match.  Some of it you dance to and some of if just makes you feel like \\"wow this is a real song with actual lyrics that make you feel something\\".  I am so glad she finally took charge of her own career and started writing her own songs.  If she is still on the worst dressed list again next year, who cares?-- she is on my BEST TALENT LIST for sure!  (anyone can learn to dress-- a CD this good?... well that takes TALENT and she has that gift for sure!)  Prediction: At age 55 Britney will be \\"over\\" as a singer, but Christina will still be at it, and will still be blowing us away with her voice!<br /><br />Michal Strahilevitz
B00005NP04|5.0|I don't usually listen to Country but I heard McBride sing on one f the Country award shows and decided I wanted to hear more. What a pleasure it is to put this disc in the player. It is rare indeed that you find a 19 selection program where you enjoy each and every selection. I am now a fan and Martina goes on my list of really good female singers. Although McBride is catagorized as Country I think her music and style transcends just one catagory and instead encompasses several. This is a perfect way to start your day.<br />Beverly J Scott author of RIGHTEOUS REVENGE and RUTH FEVER
B0000039QA|5.0|&quot;The world is mine, can't you see, I'm just trying to be all I can be.&quot;  This cd set is by far the best music I've ever purchased (and that is plenty).  I don't listen to rap of today, all in comparison do not amount to this successful album with it's great beats, rhythms and rhymes.  I own 2 of this album, one for my car, one for my house.  You will not be disappointed in this album!  Buy it today!  RIP Biggie Smalls.  Thanks for the music!!
0385486804|4.0|i found this book to be very thought provoking. its difficult not to feel a sense of closeness with mccandless. i highly recommend this book but the only thing i found disappointing were the chapters where krakauer described his own experiences. maybe i just wanted to hear more about mccandless but hey if youre into that kind of thing this is the book for you!
B0000BYM3K|1.0|Dance of Death is the worst Iron Maiden album ever !<BR>It's even worse than Blaze era.<BR>My god, Bruce's last 2 solo albums (Accident of Birth / Chemical Wedding) are million times better than this cd.<BR>What is Iron Maiden's problem ?<BR>Also it's one of the most boring heavy metal album of the year.<BR>Bottom line = DoD is a joke.
B00005AAFS|5.0|Rammstein are many things but one of them is certainly not boring. Unlike many bands Rammstein manage to make all their albums different and still sound good which is what many bands struggle with. This album is also their best in my oppinion. Even though \\"Herzeleid\\" may be their most energetic and \\"Sehnsucht\\" contains many of their standout tracks(du hast, spiel mit mir and buck dich,etc) i still personally think this is their best album seeming they have managed to take a big step from their two previous albums and actually turn out even better.                                                      <br />And ontop of that they have matured alot more and their lyrics are better to, their lyrics are less imature and gross, and Till Lindeman has decided to look back on his childhood and write a song about it called \\"mutter\\". The only song with immature lyrics is \\"Rein Raus(in, out)\\" which is just about sex. Another good thing about this album is that it has their most humorous song(lyrically) \\"Zwitter(hermaphrodite)\\" and no its not immature because while he is poking fun at hermaphrodites he is also saying how in a way it would be better to be one because you wouldn't have to risk socialising with a male/female, you could just play with yourself. So yeah much improved lyrics for sure.<br />Their music is better aswell it is much more gothic than their previous albums and the album is also much more haunting than their previous albums. My main suprise of the album is probably the fact that they tried out a bit of punk and unexpectingly susceeded because on the interview on their dvd they mentioned something like that they can't do punk and they don't like it very much, though im am glad they're much more gothic, darker and punkier then their previous albums because you gotta admit they did start to sound a little poppy. Though for the fans of their olderwork don't worry they hav'nt completely gotten rid of their energetic heavy stuff like their are about three tracks on the album that are energetic and heavy like \\"Links 2 3 4\\", \\"Ich Will\\" and \\"Feuer Fri\\".<br />My favourite track is a tie between \\"Mein Herz Brennt\\", \\"Sonne\\" and \\"Spieluhr\\" these tracks are excellent and by listening to those tracks i notice they are Rammstein's more gothic stuff, so it must mean i like their gothic stuff the most, and if you have to make me chose my least favourite track of theirs it would have to be \\"Rein Raus\\" for its sick lyrics and that its to repetitive, but don't get me wrong i don't dislike it, it is just their worst track on the album.<br />Conclusion: High replay value, no fillers, great improvement, better lyrics, more mature in every aspect, change for the better.<br />Album ratings: Herzeleid: 5/5 Sehnsucht: 4/5 Mutter: 5/5<br />Hope this review helped.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|NOTE (6-10-17): This review was originally written for the regular, theatrical version of DONNIE DARKO. Since then, I have seen it, as well as the DIRECTOR'S CUT of the film, many times. While both are fantastic, I would recommend watching the regular version first, as it is more mysterious, since the D-cut reveals certain aspects that I would, IMHO, have left hidden. Then, after seeing the original, I would watch the D-cut to fill in &#34;gaps&#34;, and to add enjoyment to the experience. Of course, this is only a suggestion. DONNIE DARKO has quickly become one of my all time favorite movies. How can I describe it? It is strange, dark (of course), cool, mysterious, enigmatic, scary, funny, serious, sarcastic, bleak, yet hopeful, mystical, and even charming. Jake Gyllenhaal is Donnie, who is absolutely believable no matter what he says or does. Time travel? No problem! A seven-foot rabbit named Frank who predicts the end of the world in 28 days? No problem! Donnie's earnestness is mesmerizing. The rest of the cast is an incredible ensemble of big stars in small, crucial roles. Drew Barrymore (E.T., The Wedding Singer, Charlies Angels) plays the only teacher in Donnie's school who seems to realize that what's being passed off as an &#34;education&#34; is actually a long, dull course in mind-numbing mediocrity (hmmm... sounds like my highschool). Noah Wyle (ER) is the science teacher who has wild theoretical conversations with Donnie about time travel, then cuts him off competely when Donnie asks if God might be involved. Donnie's mom is played by Mary McDonnell (Dances With Wolves, Grand Canyon). She loves him while being frustrated and afraid of his condition. Katharine Ross (The Graduate, The Stepford Wives) is Donnie's psychiatrist, trying to probe his mind and help him. Patrick Swayze (Dirty Dancing) plays Jim Cunningham, tele-guru and local self-help author, who is exposed by Donnie (and Frank) for who / what he REALLY is. Jenna Malone is Donnie's new girlfriendGretchen. She's got problems enough of her own. Together, this cast of characters orbits perfectly around Donnie's dark center of gravity. Do not expect the typical Hollywood bucket of swill here! Donnie Darko took actual thought to create. It's style and story are unique. I had never even heard of it due to a less than half-hearted ad campaign (I'm a TV addict, yet saw not one DD commercial). I just happened to see the DVD on the shelf and took a chance. You should too...
B0000BYM3K|5.0|This album is a very interesting mix of much of Iron Maiden's work throughout their history.  its a progression of the stuff they've done in the blaze era.. its a mix of the many different types of maiden and I think it comes out nicely... I liked BNW, I like this much more..  Its a long...album, seems like it could be shortened but I really don't know where it could be sliced up.. so this is good :)
B000002IGV|5.0|Well, I think this is a great heavy metal album and I bet everyone should love this kind of music. At least, this album worth any new metal ... albums. This is the rating for each song:<br />1. Stay Hungry: Great opener and great title song. Makes you feel the <BR>fury and you want you to explode. Great solo. Rating: 4.5/5<br />2. We're Not Gonna Take It: This is like one of the popular songs for<BR>this band. It is a rebel song with some comical lyrics. Rating 5/5<br />3. Burn In Hell: You'll be burning in hell if you don't get this album soon. <BR>Strong riffs and brilliant solo. Rating: 5/5<br />4. Horro-Teria: A track made of two songs and they are excellent. It talks about killers <BR>who target children as their victims. Rating: 4.5/5<br />5. I Wanna Rock: You might had heard it on the \\"Road Trip\\" movie and it is an<BR>energetic song and I think this song can never fade. 4.5/5<br />6. The Price: My personal favorite track on the album. It is tha calmest song on<BR>the album. I enjoyed the chorus part. Rating: 5/5<br />7. Don't Let Me Down: I'll let you down if you don't hear this song. It is a must listen.<BR>Enjoyable solo. Rating: 5/5<br />8. The Beast: \\"It's the nature of the beast\\" a powerful and aggressive metal music and<BR>everyone should like it. Rating 5/5.<br />9. S.M.F: Brilliant finish for an incredible performance and a great solo in the middle. <BR>Funny lyrics though and played perfectly. Rating 4.5/5<br />God I love solos and this album is rich in solos and you won't regret buying this product. I think this band is much better than the likes of Linkin Park and Staind. These guys used to mean business. 80's Metal is great.
B000084T18|2.0|With so much quality music coming from NY its hard to understand, how 50 has become such a superstar when surounded by quality musicians in the rap game. I do admit that the majority of beats are beutifully produced (Dre/Eminem), but if you want to here some lyrical substance within this kinda music, look no further than fellow new yorkers Necro and Ill Bills recent mixtape CD. While, there are ear pleasers such as In the club and PIMP, the product provokes a non-existant challenge for the listener, and while the comparison may sound a little harsh, 50's deliverance within both the way he mumbles and the overall structure of his rhymes are reminicent of past puff daddy protege, Mase. Still, if you like your production mill rap music, produced for the mass, then youll probably like this.<BR>Unfortunatley though, this is just another hiphop offering for the poor man to buy and the rich record exec to sell, to make a lot more than 50 CENTS.
B00005JKHN|5.0|Sad to say, but \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" is quite possibly the single most overlooked animated work of Walt Disney. While hard to believe, the 1959 film is rarely seen in it's proper perspective in the Disney universe.<br />Despite the film's strong following, it became the \\"Dark Disney\\" in later years. The dragon was seemingly too scary for the littler kids (Maleficent even uses the \\"H\\" word!), and the relative lack of funny animals in \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" was another drawback for the average Disney veiwer. As a result the film has never seemed to gain the notoriety and lasting love the other Disney's have always enjoyed. This lack of prominence makes this one of the biggest treats in the Disney vault, because it's almost a rediscovered classic from Disney's heyday.<br />All that being said, I have to admit that I've personally never seen the movie before I bought the DVD the other day! Oh, I've seen a few clips of the dragon and whatnot over the years, but never before have I had a chance to actually screen the complete film. This was a bit of good fortune, because now I got to screen the film in a pristine widescreen presentation. Lucky me!<br />The \\"Dark Disney\\" is brilliant, of course, and one wishes the studio had made a few more sojourns into the darker realm of fairy tales. Because we have been conditioned to expect kid-friendly funny animals from Disney, it's so easy to forget that Walt often wanted to push the envelope of education and art, and enlighten the audience while entertaining. With \\"Sleeping Beauty\\", he did it in spades.<br />I liked the way the Disney staff was able to extend the classic tale and at the same time retain most of the familiar elements we all know by heart (the forest of thorns, for example). Beyond that, the stylized artwork is all at once both nostalgic and timeless. The art has definite leanings toward more commercial/graphic work (a previous reviewer was spot-on mentioning 1950's greeting cards design). Best of all, despite the computer process used to clean up dust and correct color, there is no computer fakery in the animation itself, the crutch upon which the entertainment industry now depends for support in all things. Computer geeks should look to this film and see what REAL animators were once capable of!<br />What struck me most about the film (besides the stunning artwork), was just how much the film owed to \\"Fantasia\\" in both imagery and classical musical scoring. The images of the dancing minions in Maleficent's lair will certainly call to mind \\"A Night on Bald Mountain\\", and the music is in keeping with Walt's love of the classical musical sound. \\"Once Upon a Dream\\" is easily in the top five of all Disney songs, and the classical score brings to mind the famous Tchaikovsky ballet  based on the fairy tale.<br />The fairy godmothers are lots of fun, as are the kings, and the Prince's horse. To be honest, Prince William is not the most heroic Prince ever. Let's face it; the three fairy godmothers do most of the work, while the Prince takes the credit. Regardless, he does lend a bit more Princely derring-do to the Prince role than Snow White's Prince did.<br />Maleficent is truly scary, too! The imagery of the witch is at times provocative as well as frightening.<br />Lots of extras on Disc 2, including an excellent \\"The Making Of\\" documentary, and two featurettes of great note; \\"Four Artists Paint One Tree\\" shows four of Disney's premire animators in an excellent demonstration of artistic interpretations and individual styles, and a long featurette about Tchaikovsky called \\"The Peter Tchaikovsky Story\\". This secon feature is not exactly historically accurate, but it is interesting. The uncredited Paul Frees, \\"The Man of a Thousand Voices,\\" narrates.<br />We also have \\"Grand Canyon,\\" the 1959 Academy Award winner for short subject. The widescreen film follows the music of \\"The Grand Canyon Suite\\" (a la \\"Fantasia\\"), showing us a depiction of life in the Grand Canyon. Beautiful photography spoiled only by the brief appearance of cuddly cougar kittens and bunny rabbits.<br />You'll also find a surprising feature, a \\"Widescreen-to-Full screen Comparison.\\" The feature has a simple introduction, and then shows the two formats side-by-side during the \\"Once Upon a Dream\\" sequence. Although simplistic, this offers the viewer the opportunity to have the two formats clearly and concisely explained and demonstrated. While it seems like an afterthought as far as features go, it's a nice inclusion that once and for all spells out the difference between Widescreen (letterbox), and Full Screen (pan and scan). For the first Widescreen  animated feature film, \\"Sleeping Beauty,\\" I think you'll agree that Widescreen is the only way to go!<br />There are also some kid-friendly games on Disc 2, and a horrid modernized version of \\"Once Upon a Dream\\" in a music video (AVOID!).<br />This is one DVD set that no true fan of animation should be without. Anime fans should also take note, for modern anime has nothing on this rare cinematic acheivement from 1959.iled only by the brief appearance of cuddly cougar kittens and bunny rabbits. <br />You'll also find a surprising feature, a \\"Widescreen-to-Full screen Comparison.\\" The feature has a simple introduction, and then shows the two formats side-by-side during the \\"Once Upon a Dream\\" sequence.

Anime fans should also take note, for modern anime has nothing on this rare cinematic acheivement from 1959.
0385504209|1.0|This book is just another turgid attempt to foist anti-Catholic bigotry on the unsuspecting. It makes blatent errors about Catholicism that could have been solved just by looking in the catechism. I don't know any members of Opus Dei who are assassins. It smacks of how the Jesuits were portrayed in the 19th century. Amazing how anti-Catholic ignorance transcends time. No other religion gets treated this way or there would be cries of foul. Even non-Catholics will be offended by this book. Don't give the bigots your money. Buy something worthwile to read instead.
B00007KWHP|4.0|With the departure of keyboardist Tony Kaye, Yes said hello to new keyboard wiz Rick Wakeman, and together they recorded 1972's &quot;Fragile,&quot; a terrific Yes album. An enduring fan favorite, &quot;Fragile&quot; contains many Yes classics, such as the hit &quot;Roundabout,&quot; and other FM staples like &quot;Long Distance Runaround,&quot; &quot;Heart Of The Sunrise,&quot; and &quot;South Side Of The Sky.&quot; Yes also decided to give each band member a &quot;solo spotlight&quot; track on &quot;Fragile&quot;: singer Jon Anderson's vocal layer cake known as &quot;We Have Heaven,&quot; guitarist Steve Howe's acoustic &quot;Mood For A Day,&quot; Chris Squire's funky bass workout on &quot;The Fish,&quot; Wakeman's brief keyboard renduring of &quot;Cans And Brahms,&quot; and drummer Bill Bruford's &quot;Five Percent For Nothing,&quot; clocking in at a mere 35 seconds. The band's chemistry &amp; power on &quot;Fragile&quot; is amazing, as are the vocals, arrangements, and production by the band &amp; producer Eddy Offord. Although &quot;Fragile&quot; is sandwiched between two Yes albums that are, in my opinion, a little better, &quot;The Yes Album&quot; and &quot;Close To The Edge,&quot; &quot;Fragile&quot; is still an excellent Yes disc, and an enduring classic from one of progressive rock's hallmark bands.
0553103547|5.0|It is no exaggeration to say that among the ever-increasing number of multi-volume fantasy series littering the shelves, each thicker (and worse) than the last, George R.R. Martin's &quot;Song of Fire and Ice&quot; series is easily the best. With masterful prose, a twisting story that never finds rest, and characters that live and breathe, &quot;A Game Of Thrones&quot; sets into a motion a tale that will no doubt stand as a high point in modern fantasy.<br />Lovers of high fantasy; epic war stories; tales of royal intrigue; and character-based, plot-driven stories will not be disappointed by this story. Those looking for another &quot;young man goes on a quest&quot; or &quot;a dark lord is rising&quot; story, however, will be. Martin manages to throw away every modern fantasy cliche yet makes an eminently readable fantasy tale. There is little not to like here.<br />The cast of characters is huge, and Martin manages to make us believe them all. We hate them, we love them, we loathe them and we pity them. But most important of all, we BELIEVE them. The characters are consistent, complex and fascinating.<br />They're also in danger at every moment.<br />Martin, you see, has no qualms about killing off major characters. Moments of tension truly are tense because it is established very early on that main characters can and will die. And their deaths make sense, never played for shock value but rather serving the plot in a way that never feels forced, that follows what has come before, and that serves the narrative in a believable fashion.<br />And what an ever-changing narrative it is. If the title &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; sounds a bit like chess, certainly the plot looks like one, too. Viewpoints change with each chapter, and rarely is space wasted in this 800-page tome. Virtually every chapter reveals important information or, more times than not, sends the plot spinning in a new, unexpected (yet perfectly sensible and believable) direction. Martin teases you with obvious plot twists that never take place, then sends you reeling when you doubt the obvious only to have it actually happen. No, there is no predicting what will happen next ... and that is a great joy. The story keeps you on your toes.<br />The &quot;fantasy&quot; in this first volume is somewhat minimal, with some strange creatures, hints at others and a sparse bit of magic. Instead, the first book in this series is rooted with a grim tone of realism, a story about people good and evil in conflict, pushing and pulling over honor and power. It's a compelling and truly satisfying read.<br />There is no good reason for any lover of fantasy or medieval historical fiction to not own this.h obvious plot twists that never take place, then sends you reeling when you doubt the obvious only to have it actually happen.

B00000K2UX|5.0|All I have to say is this soundtrack is sooooo mighty classic.  It's 80's to the fullest.  Just look at the classic Tom Cruise cover, you know you wanna buy that.  Best tracks in my opinion are \\"Danger Zone\\" and \\"Playing With The Boys\\".  This is the best Sountrack made for crusing around in your ride.  Just buy it, its classic, nuff said.
B00004X01U|5.0|In a follow up to her breathtaking RAY OF LIGHT, Madonna digs deeper into electronica and develops a cutting edge, French discotheque sound. The title track, &quot;Music&quot; was a HUGE hit in the fall of '00 and there is no question why. Classic Madonna drops her mystic preachiness and gets back down to boogie woogie. William Orbit was back for a few tracks, though you could tell his creativity was spent. &quot;Amazing&quot; sounds nothing more than a knock-off of &quot;Beautiful Stranger,&quot; while &quot;Runaway Lover&quot; still shows a glimmer of his techno skills. My favorite track has to be the vocoder heavy, &quot;Nobody's Perfect.&quot; The strings arrangement really adds a tremendous amount of feeling, perhaps an expansion on &quot;Frozen.&quot; Other great songs include &quot;Impressive Insant&quot; (singy singy singy on a wingy wingy wingy, hokey indeed but still fun), &quot;Paradise Is Not For Me,&quot; and &quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl.&quot; This is must-own for any fan.
B00008PRR9|5.0|I was delighted (nay, ecstatic) to find this gem among the train wreck of the Who's early re-issue catalog.  Let me say right off that the sound quality of this UK import is consistantly top-notch all the way through.  And, as advertised, it IS almost entirely in true, authentic stereo (I suppose we can forgive the three minor songs that aren't).  I purchased the 1995 US version of this CD a few years ago and was outraged to find that even though the disc said STEREO right on it, it was mostly in mono.  And the sound quality, like much of the other re-issued material, was shrill and distortion-ridden in places.  But this UK release does not suffer from those problems.  This much-overlooked album disserves to be heard like this.  &quot;Boris the Spider&quot;, &quot;Heat Wave&quot;, and &quot;So Sad About Us&quot; in particular have a fresh, clean sound in wonderful, wonderful stereo!  Happy listening!
0767830555|5.0|One of the greatest films of all time and with its fair share of a few good laughs. The funniest scene had to be DeNiro taking Cybil Shepherd on a date...to a porno theatre! Her reactions are just classic. \\"You've got to be kidding, this is a dirty movie.\\" And it's not just any dirty movie, it's a Masters & Johnson instructional documentary! We also get Jodie Foster as a teenage hooker and Harvey Keitel as her crazy pimp. Sometimes it is just so much I can barely handle it.
B00006L7XQ|4.0|I stand in awe of what this man accomplished in his life.  His musical connections reached far into the past, with the Carter Family and the birth of country music, and ended with his incredible recordings of songs by Nine Inch Nails and Depeche Mode. In the 60's, when his opinions might not be popular in Nashville, he took out full-page sections of the newspaper to air his support for civil rights, and his criticism of the Vietnam War.  When people told him this would ruin his career, he told them that some things are more important.  He sang and ministered to prisoners.  He devoted much of the latter part of his life to testifying to Jesus's love and redemption. No American musician has ever shown the passion, knowledge and acceptance that Mr. Cash did.  Few people leave this world as loved and respected.  If John's family ever reads these reviews, I hope they will understand the debt of gratitude we all feel for him.  My only consolation today is that he is reunited with his beloved wife, and that they're both singing in the angel band.  Thank you, Johnny and God bless.
B00007AJF9|4.0|History is more a matter of Art than Science:  history is largely a matter of interpretations after all!  Apart from some basic facts, accuracy is only a matter of degree. Here we see the threats and constraints of Queen Elizabeth and the underlying determining facts-- almost in full, before she made a decision of the most personal nature,  that of choosing her own husband.  <br />All these matters are spun together to make a very good drama. Even if something really happened before the others in the dimension we objectively call \\"time\\", how can we say subjectively that the real force or real effects didn't take place the other way round?  Life is such a complexity and decision is not always easy to make, moreover,  and we are all eternally in a flux and so are our viewpoints! How do we distinguish an \\"action\\" from a \\"reaction\\", or whether it's merely an \\"interaction\\" , or the other way round or both, in the pysche of human beings or else in the FICTION we call \\"history\\" ? <br />This is a most entertaining as well as instructive movie, making history so sensible to most of the viewers who are fortunately not unnecesarily too pedantic: things like the loosening of the Pope's grip on England, the equilibrium between the Europeans powers or even the struggle between Scotland (and France) and England...etc.  Production and acting are good, one won't get bored by watchinging it a second time. Highly recommended.
6303122647|5.0|This is such a charming movie that it should have been rated G!  The voice acting is done so well and the songs are very catchy!!  I recommend this movie to eveyone especially children.  Don't worry parents-this is nowhere near scary and it is in no way inappropriate for little ones.  Children of all ages will love the bubbly characters and how they celebrate Halloween.
B00008S2VG|4.0|With the exception of I'm So Stupid, I thought this album was brillant. It should have garned more media attention then it did, very under-rated but very incredible.
0321146530|5.0|This is the most interesting book that I have read.  During the first 20 pages, I dispise it.  After 20 pages, I get it.  After part I, I love it.  At part III, I worship it!<br />The book start with example that involves teeny, weeny steps of test driven development that made me think this is really for people who don't know how to write test.  And I consider myself to be a fully test-infected developer -- well, until I finally understand the idea that Kent is trying to convey here.  It shows not only how to create a test case for a class, but also how to use test as the driving tool to assist refactoring for a better cleaner code.  Becaus the way of development process is so much different from the normally way (well, depends on what you think is normally, isn't it), Kent carefully makes sure that the user doesn't get ahead of himself or herself.  With little jokes here and little comments there, it really feels like being pair-programming with an XP mentor (it does, because I have been pair-programming with an XP mentor), who paitiently explains everything that is going on in his or her mind.<br />The second part of the book is also very unique.  It goes through a process of using TDD to write a unit test framework.  It shows, nicely, how to do TDD before the testing framework is in place, thus really tells what is the heart of TDD, and teaches a great lesson that TDD is not just writing test cases, but also a revolutionary development process.<br />The third part summrized patterns used in TDD, need I say more?
0375805613|3.0|Most adults don't really get this book , but I love it.  It makes me feel so naughty to torture little Grover by flipping the page.  \\"Ha ha, I knocked down that brick wall.  Oh, you better worry, I just ripped out those boards you nailed up.  Oh, you don't want me to turn the page?  Well, I'm going to anyway...\\"  What fun. <BR>   I do have some concerns with it though: should children really be reading this kind of literature?  In a \\"No Means No\\" society, should we be planting such ideas into the fragile, impressionable minds of the future.  It concerns me that the first sentences some children read are strangely sadomasochistic.  Really, throw a leather hood over Grover's head and put a zipper over his mouth and you're his instant dominatrix.  So, keep this book hidden in your dresser drawer, or you might run the risk of making a fifty mile commute every Saturday morning to visit your little boy in the state prison.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Well, I would just like to say that there is absolutely nothing wrong with Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. Sure, some extra scenes were added, but this doesn't destroy the movie. Sure, some things were left out, or changed, but so what?? Peter Jackson and the cast and crew of LOTR did a fabulous job. Everything was filmed perfectly and was completely flawless. I especially love the scenery (considering it was filmed in beautiful New Zealand), and Gollum in particular was just as I imagined he would be when reading the book. Another impressive point to consider is the wonderful music. I think Howard Shore did such a good job on this.<br />So, let me round this off by saying, that if you are a true fan of LOTR, you won't let a few minor changes destroy the movie when it has so much else going for it. This is just my personal opinion, though. I can understand (kind of) that some people don't like the movie because it's just not the sort of thing they like or because it's too long, but being a so-called \\"Tolkien Purist\\" is just stupid. I personally have read the books myself several times, and Tolkien is an absolute genius. Peter Jackson and company are only really there to make tribute to his amazing imagination and ability as a writer.
B00008H2LB|5.0|01 Foreword: a brief description of this amazing CD.<BR>02 Don't stay: a very good song with a very easy chorus and a wonderful bridge! 8/10<BR>03 Somewhere I belong: an excellent song even though it's not the BEST one. An attractive and catchy beginning. 9.5/10<BR>04 Lying from you: Too many yells but it's good. I don't really like the chorus at all but it's a &quot;medium-song&quot; 6/10<BR>05 Hit the floor: An excellent ending and intro but too many yells in the chorus, I think. Not so good. 6/10<BR>06 Easier to run: Similar to CRAWLING, in HYBRID THEORY. It's an excellent song and an excellent position in this CD. Good Job! 9/10<BR>07 Faint: Without hesitating, the BEST song in this album like others. EXCELLENT INTRO, VERSES, CHORUS AND AN EXCELLENT AND &quot;ULTRA-YELLING&quot; BRIDGE!!! Congrats!!! 10+/10<BR>08 Figure.09: Another of my BEST songs in this album. It's similar to Don't stay in the bridge. However, the chorus is totally different. EXC.!!! 10/10<BR>09 Breaking the habit: The third excellent song. Figure.09 is better than this one but this song is special, it's fast and catchy. 10/10<BR>10 From the inside: Very good song and bridge. However, it's not the best song. 9.5/10<BR>11 Nobody's listening: Outstanding. Excellent beginning with the tubes sounds and the &quot;safari environment&quot; gives a special meaning to this great song. Well done! 10+/10<BR>12 Session: without vocals, only music but it's good. 8/10<BR>13 Numb: Excellent song. Congratulations!!!!!!! 9.5/10<BR>                   <BR>                TOTAL: 105.5/120<br />This is the third album of Linkin Park and I think this is the best one. Likewise, Reanimation is an excellent album and Hybrid Theory, too. Good job for Linkin Park!!!!!
6300182150|4.0|Since the version that I just watched DOES NOT have any excessive commercials or a Where Are They Now segment, I feel more focused to comment on the movie alone.  Sometimes it pays to stick with the original format instead of an upgraded edition.  Anyway, many other reviewers are drifting off the deep end by commenting on the commercials excessively.  Stick to the meat and potatoes guys.<br />Anyway, this is a cult classic.  Pete Riegert, John Belushi, and Tim Matheson give grade A performances.  Oh what great oddball scenes ranging from the horse in the Dean's Office to the Toga Party to Otis Day And The Knights.  Even though many of the party scenes are somewhat exaggerated, Animal House succeeds at painting an accurate comedic portrait of fraternity life on college campuses in the 1960's.<br />Today it is a little sophomoric for this 40 something year old guy.  However, another part of me reminisces about my college days and how fraternities were influenced by this very humorous film.  Definitely try this one out one night when you need something to make you feel good and yearn back to your younger days.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Maiden is a band that refuses to stand still...and that's exactly what I think they have achieved with Dance of Death. It feels like a very different kind of Maiden album to me, from the lyrics, the riffs, and the production....which is a great thing! Who wants to hear another Powerslave, Seventh Son, or Brave New World..? Not me. They are very creative guys and with that comes the need to reinvent themselves. Well done guys and thank you for another great bunch of songs.<br />UP THE IRONS!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Don't get me wrong: there are many good things to say about recent Sci-Fi series (and even greater volumes to write on their passing), but the buck stops at Firefly.  Had Fox given it a chance to bloom like Farscape, or the time to flounder like Enterprise, the TV-'verse would have been a far better place to be. <BR> <BR>But Alas. <BR> <BR>And yet we Browncoats can rejoice that Firefly is to be released on a full, all eps (IN ORDER!!) DVD so that we can continue to spread the word among the ones who missed it's short 'life' on Fox. With this tool, we can continue our evangelical viewing parties, our 'Saloons' at Sci-Fi 'Cons and our banner-wavin' for the upcoming Universal silver-screen release. <BR> <BR>Let the 'Verse rejoice with the shiny DVD of Firefly, and may Serenity fly for many years to come.

0743490304|5.0|The DaVinci Code was my first Dan Brown Book quickly followed by Angels and Demons.  Deception Point was the best of three wonderful reads.  In Deception Point the action is set in a current presidental election with the usual list of unsavory political characters and general maneuvering.  The plot makes this book the most suspenseful one I have read in a long time.  NASA is reporting a new discovery that offers proof that life exists on other planets.  The story line has been reviewed several times already so I will just add that the suspense was nearly unbearable and the ending lived up to this reader's expectations with a surprise villian and wonderful end to the greedy senator who would be president at any and all costs.  Hit our 1-click ordering key for a great read as quickly as possible.
B00005JKZV|5.0|&quot;Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; is that rare breed of film that combines a dense plot, immaculate storytelling and awe-inspiring visuals.  Not since &quot;Star Wars&quot; perhaps has film captured the essence of all 3 elements as beautifully as this film does.  <br />To be sure, the first instalment of LOTR - &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; - was a grand epic in and of itself.  But, &quot;Two Towers&quot; is not only a continuation of that initial glimpse into Middle Earth - it's much much more.  It rises above the first film if  only because the middle of any great piece of art often becomes a stepping stone towards the end.  A great book can sag in the middle, when an author starts tying together the pieces that result in the climax.  Like that, a great film series (think &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;) often uses the middle installment to move the story along - though not too much - so that filmgoers are primed and ready for part 3.  The middle installment is like the middle child - the &quot;Eve Plumb/Jan Brady&quot; of moviemaking - somewhat lost between the shuffle of its older <BR>wiser sibling and the pitter patter of its adorable, always-preferred baby of the family.<br />What makes Towers so unique in this regard is that the film stands on its own two feet (like those awesome trees that avenge their own destruction) with mind-blowing effects that overwhelm your senses and literally take you to another world.  This is a movie worth repeat viewings - the dialogue is sometimes hard to follow, and of course, and many of characters and themes enjoy other-worldly terms and dialects that add to the challenge of keeping up.  But this is a film that is sure to please both diehard fans of the Tolkien story (of which I am not) AND the average moviegoer who is simply looking to be blown away by the wonder of special effects, some of which are simply awesome. <br />The story takes us forward towards the inevitable showdown between good and evil that's promised in the final film, yet it brings us closer than ever into the worlds of Hobbits and Orcs, of wizards and demons.  Gollum - a slimy character that literally comes to life despite its computerized DNA - is a stunner, and the scenes of war and mayhem, the battle of Rohan, and the return of Gandalf simply have to be seen to be experienced in their full majesty.  Any film like this is best seen first on a huge screen with a full capacity audience.  Yet, in the privacy of home, the DVD allows us to re-live those sensations while digging deeper into specific sequences that might have been obscured or glossed over in a movie theater.  We're awed by the majesty of New Zealand's grandeur, and brought to earth by the delicate friendship between Sam and Frodo, which in this film becomes truly human.<br />A wonderful, visually stunning movie that even mortals like me can enjoy over and over again.
B00000IAU3|5.0|This CD has been in my top 5 for quite some time. The music is very easy to listen to, ranging in emotions from happy to sad and reflective. The overall mood of the CD is quite relaxed. Dido's voice itself is probably the strongest asset to the music. While the lyrics themselves are good and the arrangement is much better than most music produced in the last 10 years, it is Dido's voice itself that shapes the tones and words together into art that remakes and refreshes itself everytime it's put into the CD player.<br />Have a listen to the samples provided and see what you think. I'll bet you will find you want the whole CD...
B00005B6C9|5.0|Once again the Gibb brothers produce a work of artistic genius with their release of &quot;This Is Where I Came In&quot;. They present a musical calliope that covers almost every genre. From the rocking tune &quot;Voice in the Wilderness&quot;, to the tender tribute &quot;Wedding Day&quot; (written for one of their sons), and then to the acoustic ballad &quot;Man In The Middle&quot; written and sung (appropriately) by the late Maurice Gibb, the BeeGees have once again proven that they rank right up there with Lennon and McCartney in writing and producing extrordinary recordings. If you still think of the BeeGees as a disco dinosaur, think again. &quot;This is Where I Came In&quot; deserves a listen. It is pure artistic genius.

6305428050|4.0|Chris Parker (Elisabeth Shue) is all set for an anniversary date with her boyfriend, when he cancels on her, citing a sick little sister. With nothing better to do for the evening, she accepts an offer to babysit for the Andersons. She settles in with Brad (Keith Coogan) and Sara (Maia Brewton), her charges, for a night of boredom, when her friend Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller) calls from a downtown bus station, saying that she ran away from home and then chickened out. Bundling the kids and Brad's friend Daryl (Anthony Rapp) into the car, she goes to get Brenda. The mishaps start with a flat tire, and go downhill from there.<BR>Subplots include a chop-shop, a Playmate who looks like Chris in the current issue of Playboy, and Brenda's waiting at the bus station; where she loses her glasses, mistakes a sewer rat for a kitty, and finds out that snack bars don't take checks when she tries to get a hot dog, with the classic line \\"But I don't have cash!\\" \\"Then I don't have a wiener!\\"<br />The movie was a smash hit, and launched many a career. The main actors are great, with the secondary actors doing a fine job as well. The story seems like \\"Vacation\\" in the city, but that's its charm. Chris Columbus' directorial debut, and would later direct Home Alone, \\"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone\\" and \\"Mrs. Doubtfire\\". The film is presented in anamorphic widescreen, and has some grain, but is good. The audio is a clear Dolby Surround 2.0. The extras are a huge disappointment, with the only extra being Touchstone's Film Reccomendations (One of those stupid screens where you get movies the distributor thinks you will like).

B00008IAMD|5.0|This is my favorite of the American Recordings CDs.  &quot;Hurt&quot; along with the video is one of the most powerful recordings ever.  The video sums up the life of a legend in 4 minutes so well.  His voice is powerful on this disc and I think it's wonderful that he left this for us, when he could have retired and spent his time in the mountains or on the beach.  He was the bedrock that almost every western form of music stands on today, from country to rock to pop, gospel to Americana, he will be sorely missed.  A fellow former Arkansan.
B000001Y2U|5.0|This album, Antichrist Superstar, is by far, one of the greatest albums of all time. Sounds corny, yes, but his album can make you depressed one minute, the next minute you're happy, then he can get you thinking with his unique views of religion and sexuality, and the next minute you just want to beat the hell out of something. It's crazy, but it's crazy in the best sense of the word. Usually, if I'm listening to music, I'm listening to it, but not comprehending or paying much attention to what the singer is saying. I mean, I'll hear them, but it's not sinking in. With Mr. Manson, it's quite difficult not to pay attention to what he's saying. <BR>               Songs like \\"Angel With The Scabbed Wings\\" and \\"The Man That You Fear\\" are good examples of songs that are difficult not to get caught up in. If you're in a fighting mood, I'd say your best bet is to listen to \\"1996\\" because that song is excellent (as are they all). <BR>                Basically, this album is good all the way around, so buying it would be a great idea. WARNING: Most people either really don't like Manson at all, or they are absolutely obsessed with him (as am I), so be prepared to get dangerously wrapped up in his work. When I heard this album, I immediately went and purchased all of his other albums afterwards, and I am now an official \\"Manson Freak\\" so if you're not ready to be come fully obsessed with someone this controversial, don't risk it by buying this album... Otherwise, pay the twenty dollars and get the album of the century. Thanks for listening to my views.
B00009ZYBY|3.0|When asked, the screenwriter of GLADIATOR says he was unaware of an ealier film, THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE (1964), although both stories are book-ended the same.  To the story-tellers of both films, it was apparently not important to reveal that Emperor Marcus Aurelius actually wanted his only surviving son, Commodus, to take the throne (thereby breaking the tradition of picking and adopting the best man to rule the Empire).  Also, Commodus reuled 11 years (from 180 to 191ce), although GLAIDATOR gives the impression that it was closer to 5.  Commodus' sister telles Maximus in the beginning that she has a son nearly 8 years old; later, her son meets Maximus in Rome, shortly before Commodus' death.  In reality, this child should be a man of 19, although he is depicted as closer to 13.  In the end, however, what bothers me most about GLADIATOR's script is that the tale is unfinished.  It begins in a specific year (180), and gives extensive details of the northern campaign, plus the Emperor's imagined death.   It then gives pages and pages of discussions on \\"what is Rome?\\" and how can the \\"idea that is Rome\\" be saved from the curelty of the Emperors?  Will Rome remain an Empire or revert back to a Republic?  A senator (Derek Jacobi) is introduced to show that the Senate is against Commodus.  This Sentator is finally jailed for treason and then freed - but to what end?  With Commodus dead, and Maximus dead, where is the rest of the story?  What happens next?  What happens to the senator, Commodus' sister or, especially, her son, the supposed heir to the throne?  He's old enough to succeed (historically, that is).   Does he take the throne or not?  Who is the next Emperor?  At least the 1964 film (with the most rediculous ending in Hollywood history) answers that question, with the throne being offered to the highest bidder among Rome's millionaires.  The DVD presents the film in a lovely picture and sound transfer.  Ridley Scott's film is beautifully mounted, and tookenormous pains to present equisite details of ancient Roman life.  The acting by Crowe and Reed is especially outstanding.  But without a proper ending, in my opinion, the movie fails to satisfy a certain emotion need.
0385504209|4.0|Although this is definitely a page turner, I found the end disappointing. It's as if suddenly an alarm went off and someone yelled time is up, you have 5 minutes to finish, and the author had to scramble to tie up all the loose ends. Some are hanging by a thread. Credibility is a bit thin at the end. I also found the very long detailed explanations of the religious symbolism to be excessive. It was still a good read but could have been a least a few hundred pages shorter.
B0000027RL|5.0|First off i would like to say Numba 1 Limp Bizzzkit fan's review was compleatly retarded. Pearl Jam was WAY before Creed by about 5 years. Who ever bought into that reviw was Stupid. Creed And Stone Temple Piolts are Pearl Jam Rip Off's. BAck to the album.

B0000AXE8I|2.0|I did not have a clue about what was going on in this movie. I did see the first movie and did not like it. I went to the second with some teenagers. No one enjoyed it or understood it. I consider myself a reasonably intelligent person but I did not get this movie at all. It is one thing to create a movie which is deep and thoughtful, this was neither deep or thoughtful - just confusing. Mr. Reeves gives us his usual performance - bad (he will always be \\"Ted\\").  Like the first installment, I felt I was in a 2 hour video game.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|this album is truthfully one of Maiden's best. The fast track on Monsegnur, and the epic Paschendale are two of the best. Along with Face in the Sand and Rainmaker. Great album, great band!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|The true kings of heavy metal have a new album out in 2003 and I am not talking about the overrated alternative rock band that still go under the name Metallica and sue their fans! I'm talking about the true kings of metal! The guys that never would sue a fan of their music. Lead by Mr. Edward the Great, I am speaking of IRON MAIDEN!<br />The album starts out with a very upbeat metal tune called Wildest Dreams. That sets the stage for an incredible album. There is not one song on the album that I skip over when I listen to it. I can listen from start to finish and enjoy it.<br />I love the song Rainmaker. I can't explain why, I just keep playing that and the title track, Dance of Death, over and over again. <br />But, Bruce Dickenson has been very outspoken about downloading songs off the new album. Don't sigh, he is for it. He wants you to listen to some songs off the new album and if you like it, buy it. A true Maiden fan wouldn't screw them over anyway. <br />The cold hard fact of the matter is this, metal fans. If you do download a few songs off the album and enjoy them, buy the album. Show the record companies that if someone releases an album that is worth your $15, you will spend it. Forget all the flavor of the month bands and all the record companies that blame you for the record sales dipping. Forget all bands that even consider suing children, parents, and grandparents for their own personal gain. Show the world that you are capable of buying an album with your heart, your soul, your mind no matter if the media promotes it or not. Who cares of MTV will promote Iron Maiden in 2003? The music they have released is the best that has been released in 2003. Show the world what the secret behind metal is all about, and here's a tip, it isn't rap! Take a stand. BUY IT!

The DVD is also one of the best put together around.  It has a ton of extra's and actually is one of the better put together DVD's I have seen.  Great edition to anybody's collection.
B00005RFAI|4.0|I love every single song! The only thing is that some of the language isn't appropriate
B0000BYM3K|4.0|This CD is GREAT!  <br />I think Iron Maiden began evolving to an entirely new sound with half the songs in \\"Fear of the Dark\\" and went off the deep end with \\"X Factor.\\"  Since then, they've asked themselves, \\"What the hell went wrong?!\\"  With \\"Brave New World\\" they started the long road back to playing what the fans love--high adrenaline, heart pounding, horse galloping riffs, wailing vocals, and relevant songs about mythology, history and the after-life (as opposed to sex, drugs, and rock-n-roll like every other band).<br />\\"Dance of Death\\" is not \\"good ol' Iron Maiden\\" but it is the closest thing to it since \\"Fear of the Dark.\\"  I think these guys are trying to evolve and come up with something new and still hang on to the essence in the 80s that made them the greatest band in the world and to that end they have succeeded here.  <br />The biggest surprise is \\"New Frontier\\"--a song, I think, about genetic engineering.  Totally my favorite tune on the CD.  Way to go Nicko!  If you haven't heard it yet, imagine Bruce belting out the lyrics. . .<br />Out beyond the new frontier, playing God without mercy without fear<BR>Create a beast made a man without a soul is it worth the risk a war of God and man?<br />Typical brainy, relevant, hard hitting, and hard rockin stuff IM fans love!  This is the new stuff with the good old sound!!  This is the kind of stuff they need to write more of!  The same goes for \\"Gates of Tomorrow\\", \\"Wildest Dreams\\", and \\"Rainmaker.\\"  The title song reminds me of a mid-90s Trans-Siberian Orchestra tune with a very dark edge--I like it.  \\"Paschndale\\" is powerful and complex (nice eagle scream in the middle of the song)!  The history of Paschendale is that it was a WWI battle in waist deep mud.  Mobility was non-existent and over 300,000 men on both sides lost their lives, the mud sucking them down, burying them as they died--perfect fodder for an Iron Maiden classic!  (Those of you who are offended need to listen to more IM to know what I'm talking about.)  As it turns out, \\"Paschendale\\" is no \\"Trooper\\" but it's good and the more I listen to it, the more I like it.  \\"Face in the Sand\\" is about the current war in the Middle East (you just KNEW a tune was in the making for this).  No politics here, just disgust for dictators and concern over the coming Apocalypse.  Good lyrics, good song.<br />I don't know what's up with the computer generated cover artwork.  Imagine if Derek Riggs took the cover concept and applied his usual skill and creativity!  Oh well, buy it for the music not the flash.
B000066NW0|5.0|I am absolutly in love with this cd!I atually memorized every song. It just is the best cd to listen to when your at a party, by yourself,in the car,and every where in between.
0385504209|2.0|This book is a very average mystery decorated with some religious history, commentary and theory. As a religious studies student, I found that the religious references  confused and far-fetched. I did however find some of the book interesting, but the characters and plot were predictable and forgettable.<br />At times this book is fun, but it's primarily bland and silly.
B00009W0U4|5.0|When the opening credits came on the screen for this wildly violent 2002 thriller, I though there was something wrong with the disk because some of the letters were backwards.  The film is in French and it wasn't until the film actually started and the captions were clear and easy to read that I realized that these reversed letters were just a foreshadowing of what to expect in the film.  It was going to start at the end and wind up at the beginning.<br />The writer/director, Gaspar Noe, made his creative choices wisely.  The twelve scenes unfold to the viewer with a concept in mind.  We first see an exceptionally brutal scene in which two men, Vincent Casel and Albert Dupontel, force their way into a gay sex club in search of one particular man.  They are furious and looking for revenge.  The camera slides along the darkened walls capturing the steamy atmosphere of casual intimate encounters until the two angry men finally think they've found the person called &quot;La Tenia&quot;.  What follows is a cruel and bloody bashing in of the victim's skull that is so graphic that it was difficult to watch.<br />As the film continues we learn that La Tenia is the rapist of a woman they both loved.  And still later we see the violent assault upon her.  Monica Belluci is cast as the woman and she certainly is beautiful. The attack is an awful scene to watch and goes on for a full ten minutes.  It was horrible and sadistic and the most violent scene I have ever seen.<br />And then we see the trio in happier times, enjoying themselves at a party.  As each scene develops we learn more and more about them as human beings.  This is difficult to watch because we all know the aftermath.  We also know that there is no going back to happier times.  The deeds have been done and there is no way to stop them.  It's quite an unsettling feeling, especially in the final frame when there is love and joy and so much hope for the future.<br />This is not a film for everyone.  There's incredible cruelty and ugliness.  And there are scenes that will make you want to turn your head away.  This feeling never lets up.  All my senses were shocked in this whirlwind of action.  I was horrified and upset and very moved.  And I couldn't stop watching.  The film is a small work of art and I highly recommend it.  However, it is only for the very courageous few.  All others stay away.ble cruelty and ugliness.  And there are scenes that will make you want to turn your head away.  This feeling never lets up.

6302968143|5.0|Over the years, there have been cheesey and stupid Halloween films.  There have been stupid and cheesey Disney films.  &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; does not belong in either of those categories.  It is a funny, slightly scary and above all, entertaining film for most of the family.  Disney definetely pushed the envelope here (how many jokes were there about a virgin lighting the candle?).  I remember being seven or eight and wanting to watch this move, but I wasn't allowed to because it was too scary.  Now it is easily my faviorite Holloween flick and is definitely on my A list of movies.  Bette Midler does a great job at being funny and truly frightening at the same time. The other two were funny but not scary.  She is my favorite character, and her rendition of &quot;I put a spell on you&quot; is easily one of the film's highlights.  What the heck were the critics thinking?
B00005JLT5|4.0|The uniqueness of this movie stems from the fact that the leading actor is not leading anything.<br />There is no escape from the feelings the common viewer senses as he watches the film - there is no ordinary protagonist in here. Adrien Brody, as Wladyslaw Szpilman, is actually portraying the character of an everyday person - that in the face of grave danger wants only to stay alive and is not interested in fighting back and probably dying in the process.<br />In many previous films the crowd has come to expect tales of bravery, boldness and selfishness that give rise to sublimity of the spirit and a far-reaching emotions of human bond.<br />This motion picture turns things the other way around; Szpilman is not really the hero. The real heroes are the people who take tremendous risks and help him to survive the incomprehensible and inconceivable ordeal of The Holocaust. Starting with the Jewish Capos, continuing with a few Polish friends and ending with a high rank SS officer; they are all persons that rise up beyond the mere circumstances and imminent danger, reach out and help a friend - or a total stranger.<br />The importance of this film is the return to the notion that even among the most ferocious wickedness - goodness still exists - even if in small quantities.<br />=============================================================<br />Make no mistakes, the point of view the movie presents makes it inactive and  sometimes a little bit boring. This is no \\"Schindler's List\\". Passivity is the main theme here.<br />Hard images are frequent and the movie is not suitable for children under 15.
6302484391|4.0|Set mostly in the urban jungle of New York, How To Marry A Millionaire was Marilyn Monroe's 20th film, and despite her sharing starring roles with veterans Lauren Bacall and Betty Grable, she evolved more compared to her previous hit, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.<br />Schotzie Page (Bacall), Pola Debevoise (Monroe), and Loco Dempsey (Grable) are three models who live in an expensive penthouse apartment.  Their master plan, engineered by Schotzie, is to snag classy-looking people who wear neckties and to get nobody under six figures a year.  The apartment is to keep up appearances.  Appearances?  Within three months, DISappearances is what happens, especially to the furniture.<br />The men they meet are a mixed bag.  Tom Brookman likes Schotzie, but with the way he dresses, which isn't that bad, she thinks he's a common gas pump jockey.  J.D. Handley is a middle-aged widowed Texan millionaire who's charming and polite in a smooth but humble way.  Schotzie falls for him.  Waldo Brewster is an uptight square who's married and complains about his family, but that doesn't stop him from snagging Loco.  The two deserve each other, as he bellyaches while she whines.  Pola ends up with J. Stewart Merrill, who's quite the fashion victim with that jewelled eyepatch of his.<br />The fashion show segment is a highlight, seeing the fashions of the 1950's.  Of the three, Pola's red outfit is striking.  And of the dreams the three have, Loco's is the funniest compared to the other two's.<br />As for the women trio, Lauren Bacall (Schotzie), Marilyn Monroe (Pola), and Betty Grable (Loco) do well, though Bacall is the character we see struggling to overcome her pride and thus the most interesting one.  Monroe plays the nearsighted Pola with laughs, as we see her bumping into things when she refuses to wear her glasses in front of men.  She's the most lovable of the three.  In fact, her scene with David Wayne aboard the plane is my favourite in the whole movie.  And actually, she does look cool with glasses.<br />Speaking of which, this was Wayne's fourth and last film with Monroe.  He plays Freddie Denmark, the owner of the apartment the trio are living in.  Two other stars deserve honorable mention.  It's quite a sight to see the 50's blonde beauty queen starring opposite her predecessor of the 1940's, Betty Grable, who in a modelling sequence, briefly strikes a pose reminiscent of her famous pinup.  And William Powell (Handley) in his penultimate film plays his role with a quiet dignity of a man in his years looking for emotional fulfillment.<br />A film injoke occurs when Schotzie says she likes older men, listing Roosevelt, Churchill, and \\"whatsisname in African Queen\\"  The joke is that Lauren Bacall IS married to Humphrey Bogart.  Another is when Loco hears the radio and thinks Harry James is playing.  James was of course Betty Grable's husband at the time.<br />There are two Movietone newsreels here, one for the premiere of this movie, the other for the sneak preview of The Seven Year Itch.<br />This remake of The Greeks Had A Word For Them was the second movie filmed in CinemaScope, the new 2.35:1 widescreen process pioneered by Henri Chretien, the first one being The Robe.  Hopefully, Chretien got to see this movie before his death in 1956.  The opening number \\"Street Scene\\" is a six-minute orchestral prelude that served no other purpose than to show off stereophonic sound.<br />This is a slightly better gold-digging manhunter movie than Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, as the message comes through that money doesn't necessarily buy you happiness, even though it doesn't automatically depress one either.  However, Handley says it best when he says \\"there's only one cure for loneliness--human companionship.\\"ok cool with glasses.<br />Speaking of which, this was Wayne's fourth and last film with Monroe.

B00005AQE8|5.0|Who ever doesn't like this CD there must be something wrong with you. It's probably one of the best CD's of all time. The beats are banging and the best thing about this album i there is no intro, skits or inserts just pure music. The 2nd Disc is better than the 1st disc. Some of the best songs on the album is Only God Can Judge Me, Tradin' War Stories, Thug Passion, Picture Me Rollin, All Eyez On Me, and Ain't Hard 2 Find. All these songs are way better than the radio hits. Even if u don't like rap the production and the beats on this album are just so good. This CD can never be played out and its 2Pac at is best.
B00004R99R|1.0|Okay, so I see so many bad reviews calling Pocahontas inaccurate but most for this movie say &quot;Lighten up!  It's a great movie!&quot;  However, I love Pocahontas and hate this movie.  Why?  Because Pocahontas kept the spirit of the story alive and generally got the same message across.  This movie, as one review put it, lacks any respect or regard for Greek mythology.<br />First off, I will admit that I am a huge Greek mythology fan.  I know that every Disney movie is inaccurate, and at all different degrees. However, I judge by the movie itself and am willing to accept inaccuracies if the movie is worth it.  And indeed, Hercules is in no way worth it.<br />My friend said that Hercules seemed like an attempt to fit Greek characters into the typical Disney formula, which seems like a good way to summarize it.  What were once engaging characters were made flat, lacking the realistic flaws that made them so endearingly human in the myths. Hercules is basically your perfect good guy hero, instead of the conceited, musclehead with a foul temper.  I'd complain about Megara's persona certainly not belonging in that timeframe, but I love Susan Egan and she made it work.  The only god who was really sort of accurate was Hermes.  And I do agree that the gods were absolutely hideous, save Aphrodite.  <br />My biggest complaint, though, goes with the thing that everyone praises: Hades.  Yes, he is my favorite god and I am biased, but they threw away what is known about his personality and adapted him to fit their usual witty Disney villain.  And yes, he was an entertaining character, but at what cost?  The thing that I always liked about Hades was that he wasn't evil.  Basically, they seemed to have said &quot;Lord of the Underworld?  Wow, that's a perfect villain!&quot;  In my opinion, someone like Ares would have been better-suited for being the villain. I mean, Pain and Panic originally belonged to him anyway! And if they had to really destroy Hades' character they couldhave at least had Persephone, too.<br />I did love the music, though, especially Megara's solo &quot;I Won't Say I'm in Love.&quot;
B00009RGBS|3.0|First of all, people may not agree with me, but &quot;Chicago&quot; IS a great movie. I agree that Richard Gere cannot sing. And that some of the lyrics just don't make sense. But you have to consider that Rob Marshall did a great job on gathering information not only from the play and some of Fosse's movies, but from the life style of the 1920's. <BR>  Also notice that the number &quot;I can't do it alone&quot; has a great choreography.And there are some great camera angles and tricks. And I'll have to admit that there are a couple of numbers where you'll be about to fall asleep, and that maybe if you blink you'll<BR>miss something important. But after all, watching the movie is loads of fun and I recomend it to all of you.
B00004R99T|1.0|First off, I loved the first Pocahontas.  That is, until I saw this one.  Now I can never really enjoy it to the same level again, at least not until a few years from now when I've forgotten about this awful thing.<br />While it's wonderful that Disney attempted to set things right, they couldn't have done it in any worse way.  I hated Rolfe from the beginning; he never develops once.  That's pretty tough considering that he's the &quot;romantic hero&quot;... and pretty much having a romance is an easy way to develop someone.  Not this guy, though, he's about as endearing as a steel pole.  <br />I hate the tea chick, which is what I'm going to call her for lack of knowing her name.  The woman, to whose charge Pocahontas is placed, seems like a feeble attempt to make me like John Rolfe: &quot;Oh, he and this sweet if blundering old lady have an affectionate relationship!  He's a good guy after all!  Oh Pocahontas, soon you'll see that!&quot;  BLECH, it was so painfully obvious that she was just an attempt at character development that didn't quite work.  The only thing she was good for was actually inspiring what was close to laughter... although that was only twice.  Wiggins in the first movie, however, puts the tea chick to shame.<br />I'm going to admit that I HATE the ending.  Who the heck cares if it's more historically accurate?  The point is that if you're going to be historically inaccurate, go all the way!  I absolutely loved the Smith/Pocahontas thing in the first movie because both were passionate, lived for danger and excitement, and had as much chemistry as people in animated movies can   have.  Their relationship is well-developed, as are both people as they kind of come to terms with each other's culture.<br />John Rolfe, though?  He is pompous from the beginning until the horribly forced ending.  I'm not sure if it was just me, but it really seemed like he only liked Pocahontas after she had become &quot;civilized.&quot;  John Smith liked her for whoshe was, not because she was dolled up in a painful musically-challenged sequence that made me think of &quot;You'll Bring Honor to Us All&quot; from Mulan with sheer longing.  Speaking of which, I don't understand what John Rolfe was on--she looked HIDEOUS in that getup.  <br />The animals also seemed to be an attempt to make John Rolfe more likable, because we're supposed to think &quot;Hey, the animals want them together, and they want what's best for Pocahontas so that must be what's best for her!&quot;  Pfff, that just made me hate Meeko and Flit.<br />Actually, the whole London song made me think of a bad attempt to mime Bonjour from Beauty and the Beast.  I really think that Pocahontas would have found the city intrusive and smelly, because think of the change she would have went through.<br />And yes, I agree that John Smith was 100% percent, unadulterated, pure Out-of-Character.  I saw and agree with a previous review that stated that they seemed to want to make him a jerk so we wouldn't feel bad about Pocahontas ditching who had once been &quot;the love of her life.&quot;  Disney, however, seems to have forgotten that they spent an entire movie making him likable and a worthy match for their almost overly-glorified heroine.  To just throw that away almost makes me sick; why bother watching the first movie with &quot;She's going to eventually screw him over&quot; hanging over your head.  <br />Actually, I didn't like Pocahontas either.  She seemed OOC as well; certainly the Pocahontas in movie one would not have accepted a man who seemed to ring more of Radcliffe than anything.  And that Pocahontas would not have let John Smith go.  Then again, that wasn't really John Smith and it wasn't really Pocahontas either.  I don't know who these two were, but I certainly didn't like them.  I liked them more, though, than I liked Rolfe.  Which says a lot.<br />Oh, they needed some cameos.  Thomas, Wiggins (he would have made this movie worthwhile), etc.  <br />I agree that Radcliffe was totally demonized.  I actually had some sympathy for him in the first one, since it was made clear that he was just trying to succeed at something and prove the others at court, who hated him, wrong.  Although he was villainized a lot in the first, it pales in comparison to the second.  I also agree that it was crazy that James believed him.  James, too, was a cartoony 2d character.  Poor guy, the movie insults him more than anyone.<br />And yeah, I also found it weird that Pocahontas knew about John Smith's death.  <br />Basically, I'm just saying that you should either not watch this movie, forget about it, and/or just plain pretend that it doesn't exist.  I can't wait until I forget about this awful thing and can enjoy the first one and I used to be able to do.
078322608X|5.0|I'll admit up front to being a sucker for Terry Gilliam movies.  That said, 12 Monkeys is a stylish and well-crafted movie, featuring an engaging plot, terrific performances from Willis, Pitt, and Stowe, great visual design, and a bit more to think about than your average summer blockbuster.<br />The DVD edition has some terrific extras, uncluding \\"The Hamster Factor,\\" a fun look at some of the struggles in the making of the movie, and Gilliam's voice-overs, which do a good job of making it feel like Gilliam's at your house for a screening.<br />The screenplay for 12 Monkeys was inspired by Chris Marker's La Jetee, a short art film which is also worth seeing.  Although it's nice that Gilliam and screenwriters David and Janet Peoples credited the inspiration for the film on-screen, it's worth noting that this is just a reflection of their integrity, not a sign that the movie is any more derivative than anything else.
B00004R99I|5.0|I was a very precocious child; when this movie first came out I was in elementary school and would rant to anyone who'd listen about the historical inaccuracies.  Even after seeing the movie in theater I carried that opinion, and it wasn't until recently that it changed.  So, for those of you who complain that your kids won't know any better... give them more credit.  Even if you do tell them, they probably won't care.  Why?  Because kids don't nitpick; if they like it, they like it.  I wish that I had been that way, it's a part of childhood that I never had a chance in which to partake.<br />Anyway, two weeks ago or so my AP US History teacher showed a clip of the movie in his class while we were learning about the London Company and so forth.  Before you have a chance to gasp over the horror that this abomination to history was actually shown in a history class, let me just say that my teacher told us that it was exaggerated but there was some truth to it (it was the Dig song)<br />In my opinion, that statement holds true for the entire movie.<br />First off, I can tell that Disney did take time to do research.  They didn't just make it up entirely.  I was most impressed with the references: King James, the Virginia Company, the idealism that the settlers carried, especially &quot;the white man's burden&quot; were all pretty true to history whether or not we can accept that.  The Indians were pretty much portrayed as every Indian is portrayed in these kinds of movies, but like everyone else in the movie were exaggerated.<br />As someone who absolutely abhors Hercules this may be hypocritical, but I think that we should look past the historical inaccuracy in Pocahontas, because the greater messages are true.  And I think that if you view it as a separate tale, one that didn't really occur, you'll like it a lot more.  <br />I do not understand how people can criticize the music.  It's absolutely beautiful, and the constant background music adds so much to the effects of the gorgeous animation.  And as a huge Judy Kuhn fan, the singing was lovely.  The only thing with which I had a problem was Powhaten's singing voice (he was so much better as Rasputin's in Anastasia)... but you can't win them all, I suppose.<br />I used to hate the talking tree, now I don't mind her.  The animals are used in quite an interesting manner; almost as an allegory for what happens between the Powhatens and the settlers.  Of course there is a lot of slapstick humor between them for the kiddies' amusement, but older people should be able to look past that.<br />Seriously, though, I don't see anyone complain about how Aladdin butchered the Muslim tale on which it was based.  Probably because it was so well-done.  Well, I believe that Pocahontas was so well-done that people need to get off of their high horse and just enjoy a beautifully-told story for once.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay's &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; is by far the most brilliant, breath-taking, deeply moving, artistic, soul-stirring album of all time. Chris Martin and the gang are pure genius. I became a fan when i first heard the song &quot;Yellow.&quot; I knew this was going to be a band that would soon pave the way to a new fresh meaningful breed of music. <br />Here are my favorites along with a brief description:<br />#1 The Scientist- When I first heard this song, my mind immediately left my body and drifted into an earthly heaven. I suddenly felt calm and at peace. The piano ripped open the door to my soul and made it's presence known. I somehow feel that this song's one purpose is to help give meaning and direction to our lives. I have to admit though, it is very sad, yet soothingly redeeming. The tears just started rolling as Chris performed Ooohs towards the end. I still get teary eyed each time I listen. But they are more like tears of joy, because I have been touched with a sense of hope and love.<br />#2 In My Place- This has got to be the twin brother of &quot;Yellow.&quot; The chorus is the best part. Very enlightening song!<br />#3 Green Eyes- Good lord, this is great stuff. Whenever I hear this song, it's like i'm inhaling fresh crisp cool air on a mountain top. It's quite hip, refreshing, and puts me in a great mood.<br />#4 A Rush of Blood to the Head-Can they get any more brilliant? The Scientist took my soul. This one took everything else. <br />#5 Clocks- I think Beethoven, Bach, and Mozart are all smiling from ear to ear. I know I am! Great SONG period.<br />#6 Amsterdam- Pefect ending to a great album!!!! A soft and serene exit. No need to go out with a bang. The bang will be track 1 on the next album!<br />Ok, so my favorites are 6 out of 11. Not bad. The other songs are good too! I just tend to flock more towards the sappier side of life. This album should be purchased by anyone who has 15 bucks in their pocket. And why hasnt Coldplay won the Nobel Prize yet? Chris Martin definitely has a beautiful mind.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Johnny Cash is just an all around wonderful man.  He shows what can be accomplished in a lifetime.  How we all have pain and hardships, but must continue to do what is right.  And although it took years for Johnny to see what was right he did see the light and wrote his wonderful song, Hurt.  This song Hurt, was how I knew for sure that Johnny was saved and lives in heaven.  Johnny  is a great mentor and I know his legacy shall live on forever. May God Bless his family.
B00004Z459|5.0|Some may find it too loud, so may find it too morbid, others may simply don't like it; non the less, this band of young geniouses has embarked on the fusion of amazing music genres such as Techno, Rap, Rock and Metal to create something totally new, and deep, very deep.... The lyrics speak out for the modern mind, expresses the trapped feeling that all beings tend to experience; and takes on the side of look from the practical side of emotions. It may be loud, it may be morbid, but it is touching and definitely moving. The mind cannot stay cold against this amazing work of art. To the rebellious minds: get it! To the unexperienced: try it! And to the true modern souls: believe in it!
B00006IU73|4.0|So I decided to write a review for this album finally.  I'm actually glad I waited because the first time I listened to it I was really disappointed, I think some of the other reviews gave me the wrong impression on what this band was going to sound like, so I was expecting a heavy Pink Floyd or something and the album really isn't heavy except for a couple of riffs hear and there.  Any way after a few listens this album and Steven Wilson really began to grow on me.  Highlight songs are her blackest eye's and Trains.  These to songs are so good that its worth the price just for them, but some of the other songs are pretty good as well.  The reason I docked this album a star is for some of the more psychedelic spacey tracks that just don't do it for me musically.  Before I wrap this up let me clear something up, this band is not in any real genre of music so lets do them a favor and stop saying they are.  They have a very different sound from song to song and album to album, a very good sound for the most part, but I think it does them an in justice to categorize them with bands like Dream Theater (my favorite band) and Pink Floyd as they are on a similar level with these two bands but altogether different.  To sum it up buy this album, its good music however you cut it, but give it a listen or two before you make up your mind, I promise it will grow on you in a big way.  Amazingly fresh and despite being a little demented very enjoyable.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|Highly recommended. DoD is a great follow up for BNW. If you didn't like BNW (or you don't like TRUE Metal) you will probably just consider this an average CD, but if you like Metal, listen to it and you will see it is a good step in Maiden's evolution. Up the  Irons!!!<br />  I also recommend:<BR>  * Iron Maiden's Brave New World &amp; Seventh Son of a Seventh Son<BR>  * Therion's Vovin &amp; Secret of The Runes (One of the best CDs I have ever heard!!!)<BR>  * Blind Guardian's Nightfall in Middle-Earth, Tales From the Twilight World &amp; Imaginations From the Other Side<BR>  * Iced Earth's Horror Show
B000063CMK|1.0|I'll be brief since every one else seems to think they need to write a novel.  I thought this album was a major disappointment, I have only listened to it all the way through once and that was hard to do.  I feel that it could have been very good, the music is alright and the album idea is kind of cool, but the vocals are way over done.  The guy has a cool voice but he throws all this weird [stuff] in their with his singing and it wasn't \\"emotive\\" like other reviewers said, it was lame and made the album hard to listen to.  There are only two songs that he doesn't screw up and one of them is an instrumental piece that is actually really good.  I plan on burning the two good songs onto a cd and sending this album down the trash disposal, so unless you like good music ruined by strange vocal noises and grunts don't bother with this one!

B00003CXA2|5.0|What's there not to like about this film? It seems to have everything: crisp direction, outstanding acting, a compelling narrative, life lessons worthy of affirmation, highly innovative special effects, and a soundtrack whose CD continues to be a bestseller. It received and deserved five Academy Awards and could have received others as well. Of special interest to me is director Robert Zemeckis and his crew's brilliant integration of material from Winston Groom's novel with historical material in the 1960s and 1970s. I am not referring to Sonny Shroyer as Paul (\\"Bear\\") Bryant or Peter Dobson as a young Elvis Presley; rather, to the inclusion of footage of John F. Kennedy and George W. Wallace in scenes in which Forrest (Tom Hanks) appears. What is fact? What is fiction? Who cares?<br />Another question: \\"Where's Forrest?\\" At various points in his life, he is outrunning childhood tormentors on bicycles, scoring touchdowns for the University of Alabama, attending a White House reception, proving himself worthy of a Congressional Medal of Honor for heroism in Viet Nam, attending a major peace rally at the Lincoln Memorial, launching what becomes a highly profitable shrimp company named in honor of a Viet Nam comrade, defeating international ping pong champions, creating a \\"smiley face\\" which makes another person wealthy, jogging thousands of miles throughout the United States, re-settling in his family home, reuniting with a young son he did not know he had, marrying his beloved Jenny....<br />Some people have told me they think this film is \\"corny\\" and that Forrest is \\"dumb.\\" If \\"Stupid is as stupid does,\\" what he accomplishes suggests otherwise.  However, who he is as a person is far more important to me. I admire Forrest because he is a thoroughly decent man whose wisdom cannot be measured by I.Q. tests or net worth. I would be proud to have him as a son or son-in-law, as the father of my grandchildren, and as a next-door neighbor. Who wouldn't?<br />FYI: The special features which supplement the DVD version of this film are among the most informative I have examined thus far. Why is that not also true of so many other great films? Perhaps Mrs. Gump is right: \\"Stupid is as stupid does.\\"l features which supplement the DVD version of this film are among the most informative I have examined thus far.

0385512104|5.0|Mark Haddon's touching novel, &quot;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,&quot; is the story of a British fifteen-year-old  boy named Christopher Boone.  Christopher has a form of autism.  He is a genius in math and science, but he has trouble understanding facial expressions and he communicates with others without making eye contact.  He abhors being touched by anyone, and he groans and withdraws when he is upset.  Christopher goes to a special school and he clings to the routines that make his life bearable.<br />One night, Christopher's orderly world is shaken when he finds a neighbor's dog, Wellington, dead of stab wounds.  Christopher loves dogs and he determines to use his sharp mind to find out who killed Wellington.  Christopher's father orders his son in the strictest terms not to stick his nose into other people's affairs.  However, Christopher ignores his father's orders and his investigation leads him down some unexpected paths.<br />Haddon's book is a brilliant journey into a world that few people can even contemplate.  What must it be like to have a literal mind that can process only certain types of arcane information but is powerless to handle the everyday social interactions that we all take for granted?  Haddon, who has worked with autistic individuals, has deep compassion for Christopher.  By writing this book from Christopher's point of view, the author enables the reader to feel this boy's confusion, anger, and heartbreak as his life begins to unravel.  Haddon not only lifts the curtain on an autistic's boy's world, but he also explores the strain that having such a child places on his parents.<br />&quot;The Curious Incident&quot; is eloquent, poignant, darkly humorous, and unforgettable.  I predict that this book will become a classic and I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in the intricate workings of the human mind and heart.
0790729369|1.0|So romantically cloying, it bathes viewers in a love story that's about as subtly manipulative as tar and feathers. It starts off well enough with Eastwood arriving in a small Iowa farm town to photograph bridges for National Geographic and meeting immigrant housewife Streep with a thick Italian ( Italian? I would have guessed Czecklesovokian! ) accent. After a sexual encounter the two carry on a brief but passionate affair that's about as invigorating and sexy as Barbie kissing Ken. Through it all, Streep's husband is away at a county fair concerning something about a 'prize cow'. Talk about your Freudian nightmare! It took me several sittings to get through this tear-jerker which comes equipped with it's own box of soggy Kleenix.
0553213105|5.0|In &quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot; Jane Austen creates an entire universe out of the circumscribed world of genteel British society.  The main focus of the novel is the Bennet family, consisting of a nervous and silly mother, her indolent and sarcastic husband, and their five daughters.  Mrs. Bennet desperately wants her daughters to marry wealthy men, especially since Mr. Bennet's property will go to a male cousin, Mr. Collins, upon Mr. Bennet's death.<br />Soon, a likely marriage prospect appears in the person of Mr. Bingley, who rents a nearby home in Netherfield Park.  Mrs. Bennet  hounds her husband to call on Mr. Bingley immediately so that the Bennets can make his acquaintance.  To Mrs. Bennet's delight, Mr. Bingley proves to be a perfectly amiable and wealthy gentleman.  However, his close friend, Fitzwilliam Darcy, is quite the opposite of Bingley.  Darcy is a man whose arrogance and cold demeanor make him immediately unpopular with the Bennets, especially with Elizabeth Bennet, one of the daughters whom he particularly insults.<br />&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; deals with the preconceived notions that people have about one another and how these ideas wreak havoc with relationships.  Austen also casts her astute eye on the social mores of the time which made both men and women slaves to convention.  Marriage was not just a pleasant state for a woman.  It was a necessity, especially if her family lacked the means to support her for the rest of her life.<br />One of the most noteworthy aspects of this novel is Austen's lively cast of characters.  Elizabeth Bennet is surely one of the most vivacious, witty, and entrancing heroines in British fiction, and she meets her match in the dashing, proud, and inscrutable Mr. Darcy.  Austen's portraits of the stuffy and pompous Mr. Collins and his overbearing and opinionated patroness, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, are hilarious.<br />Austen's novel is a high-class soap opera in many respects, with a myriad of romantic entanglements and much intrigue to keep the reader engrossed.  However, it is much more than that.  It is a masterful tale of how people deceive themselves and the traps that they fall into when they are weak-minded and easily manipulated by others.  &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is also a beautiful and romantic story of how men and women find their soul mates in spite of seemingly insurmountable obstacles.entanglements and much intrigue to keep the reader engrossed.

B000002H2H|4.0|.....is that James Hetfield has got to be the worst singer in the history of music, and yet i really don't care.   i'm not a metalhead, i just picked this up because i loved the cover and metallica is supposed to be a great band.   this is the loudest, dirtiest, angriest stuff i've ever heard (except FADE TO BLACK).   it's absolutely awesome, it sounds like the guitars have been speeded up half the time, hetfield is screaming so loud you can feel his throat ripping apart.   still, the best song here is CALL OF KTULU, a 9-minute heavy instrumental closer.   i expect to buy MASTER OF PUPPETS and any other highly rated metallica records soon.
0743243153|5.0|I read this book about 12 years ago and it is still one of my favorites. I keep going back to it whenever I feel frustrated, lost, afraid, or depressed and it almost always puts me back in perspective again. Although there are truckloads of self-help books in the market today, this is one of the most well written, inspiring, and insightful. There are a few books that have significantly changed my life for the better and I can honestly say that this is one of them. Another book I recently discovered is &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; by Toru Sato. This book has taken me to the next step in my understanding of life, love and spirituality and I would also recommend this one for those who are ready. Both of these books are truly exceptional! Thanks to wonderful writers like this, people like myself have a guiding light to walk the path.
B00005JM0B|4.0|When T3 begins, a lot of audience members might ask themselves \\"How can this possibly top T2?\\". The simple answer is, it can't.<br />That isn't shameful by any stretch, as T2 was arguably the best action movie ever made. T3, however, manages to have both great action and a great story, more than enough to entertain and even provoke thought. Though showing his age, Arnold still manages to shine in the role that made him a real movie star, and Nick Stahl is a great replacement for Edward Furlong's John Conner. While it probably won't make it onto any top 10 lists, T3 is more than enough to please any fans of the series or action fans in general.
B00005QDW5|5.0|For me that is. I bought this album about a year ago, and it introduced me to what is now my favorite band. That being said there are some things now are a little strange, but that would happen with any &quot;Best of&quot; compilation. They skip a few of the Pink Floyd albums and there are no Live tracks. The best songs from Dark Side of The Moon are here, as well the best from Wish You Were Here and The Wall. Sheep is not what I what have put from Animals however. I do not like the Final Cut album that much so I am glad they did not put more then one on. The Division Bell is a great album, three may be a little excseeive, but they are all very good songs. The CD booklet is very well done and informative. As stated earlier Pink Floyd is thanks to this CD my favorite band. It could have been a little bigger but is a great starting point for anyone who wants to get to know what Pink Floyd is like.

B0000AKCLS|5.0|Joe has done it again. You'll love the fact that he has returned to his blues roots and honors some of his heroes with great covers that are really so much more than that. He imbues his own spirit into each song and makes it his own. His guitar playing has the subtlety of B.B. King and the ferociousness of SRV or Walter Trout. Yet through it all, his own unique style comes shining through and grabs your attention. There is not a bad song on this album and I can't stop playing it. Two simple words, GET IT!!!
B0000A02TZ|5.0|Animal House is all too often lumped in with a multitude of inferior films that it inspired, which is rather unfair. The movie sported the greatest cinematic finale of all-time, each of its scenes have countless moments of comic inspiration and suprise, and it is probably the most quotable and hilarious movie made in the last quarter of the last hundred years.<br />This was Belushi at his best with a bravura performance reminiscent of great comics before him like Chaplin, Marx Brothers, etc., and he did it with aplomb. His character of &quot;Bluto&quot; Blutarsky is often emulated and imitated but often the persons doing so have no idea what it was that made him and his performance so great.<br />Tim Matheson as &quot;Otter&quot; and his other frat house buddies were also prototypes that were much imitated too, and again often without success. Otter was the quintessential smooth talker, always working an angle on everybody, especially the ladies. When a woman tells him that his lovemaking wasn't that great, he cocks his head, points a finger at himself and mouths the words, &quot;not great?&quot; in mock disbelief. Before Tom Hanks got &quot;Big&quot; he made a career out of playing this character. Also John Vernon set a standard for straight men with his portrayal of the beleaguered Dean Wormer, plagued by his &quot;zoo fraternity.&quot;<br />Not all of the movie's humor is below the belt (voyeurism) or just above it (beer)...some of it is actually quite suave. The screenwriters and director John Landis did a great job evoking Kennedy-era America and they found a lot to laugh at.<br />An unqualified classic by the simplest definition -- it makes you laugh, long and loud -- this is easily a required addition to your collections. And it holds up its own to repeat viewing.
0553565915|5.0|Having now read both Harold Sherman and Betty Eadle on the subject of life after death, I am still greatly perturbed by the possibility of eternity without baseball or beer, and eternity itself still sounds like it could be boring.<br />However, the following edited quotation from the Eadle book was somewhat invigorating.<br />*...I was led to a room, which was exquisitely built and appointed.  I entered and saw a group of men seated around the long side of a kidney-shaped table.  I was led to stand in front of them within the indented portion of the table.  One thing struck me almost immediately; there were twelve men here - MEN - but no women.*<br />*As a rather independent thinker on earth, I was sensitive to the roles of women in the world.  I was concerned about their equality and fair treatment and had very strong opinions as to their ability to compete with men on an equal footing in most settings.*<br />*I might have reacted unfavorably to this council of men and no women, but I was learning to have a new perspective about the differing roles of men and women...*<br />*With this new perspective, I had no reaction to the council being comprised solely of men.  I accepted the fact that they had their roles and I had mine.*<br />WELL!  How about THAT?  There are large numbers of uppity females and effete males who are in for a rude awakening someday.<br />Because everything that those much-maligned reactionary male religious leaders said in the past really WAS true.  Male supremacy and sexual differentiation really ARE the will of God and are eternal.<br />If THAT'S not a reason to overcome one's fear of death, I don't know what is.  If this isn't worth five stars, I don't know what is.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|I enjoyed the albums with Blase although 'The X Factor' was the better album. When I saw Maiden in '96 with Bruce and Adrian, I had high hopes -- 'Brave New World' did not disappoint, but did not have the 'staying power' of earlier albums. This was the first Maiden album in many years that caught my attention and kept it. Yes, there are lyrical and musical themes from earlier albums, but as a whole this album stands together better than Seventh Son and deserves to be called a Maiden classic although it is new. Buy, listen to it, and decide for yourself.
B00000BKE0|5.0|While this album doesnt cover any new grounds,it takes you back on some old ones.Listen closely to a lot of these songs and you can here elements of everything from the first iron maiden album,up to Powerslave.The lyrics are NOT what maiden usually write but the song structures hold these songs together really well.Even though i'm not a big Janick Ger's fan,he doesnt ruin the album,its saved by creative Harmony parts along with Nicko's signature drumming...some great high-hat work and the big drum sound that he used on Piece of Mind.And Bruce try's out a harsh new vocal style...a lot of people don't like...but i think it fits here rather well.Where people get that the production is FLAT i'll never know.To me the production on Fear of the Dark was FAR worse.But all in all lots of good stuff here,Run Silent Run Deep,The Assassin,Fates Warning,Tailgunner.About the only song's i don't care for a whole lot is Holy Smoke or Hook's in You,lyrically speaking,but hey lyrics alone DON'T make a good album.And this one i like a lot.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I must say, i wasn't a fan of this girl because i don't like pop but this cd is a piece of art, this woman can sing!, and not only, she can write decent songs too.<br />i loved the interludes, the way she sing every song; particulary  i love cruz i identify a lot whit that song its so free and strong at the same time. other of my favorites is walk away it's an amizing song apasionate, sad and deep song,get mine get yours: this song is just SEXY that's the best word to discribe it. soars impecable, pure , great message and of course beautiful is honest it's just amaizing.<BR>now i'm a fan of Miss Aguilera 5 stars
B000002NHN|4.0|Coming off arguably her best and most cohesive album (The Mask and Mirror), Loreena McKennitt continues her musical journeys through this album, The Book Of Secrets. While not as strong as The Mask and Mirror, this album still has a lot to offer.<BR>Anyone who has been a fan of LM for any period of time can trace a gradual bend from Celtic influences of her early albums to her recent explorations of middle eastern sounds and moods. This album takes those explorations even further, and are fully realized in wonderful tunes such as The Mummer's Dance and the hypnotic Marco Polo. Other strong tracks are The Highwayman and the gorgeous Dante's Prayer.<BR>Also, her liner notes are (as on the last album) written in diary form and come across as being a bit pretentious, but this is a minor gripe. Listen to the music!<BR>For those who love really great world music that blends east and west and is easy on the ears, you can't get much better than Loreena McKennitt.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|Granted, it had a lot to live up to, considering the first movie was amazing.  But that is not an excuse for the mess that is presented in Reloaded.  Amateurish mistakes are made.  It's melodramatic, poorly acted, poorly scripted, and (God save me for saying this) they needed Jerry Bruckheimer to produce and edit, or someone like him anyway.  For some reason the Wachowski brothers feel the need to prolong every scene, dragging out the movie to interminable lengths.  It'd be different if it was for some sort of filmic purpose, but its not.  Remember the agent smith multiplication scene?  Remember watching it knowing Neo can't be hurt, and remember that it drug on for 15 minutes?  Remember the pie that makes the girl have an orgasm we get to view through the matrix?  All of this is retarded and needless.  Flaws abound...I could go on, but you've probably heard them all.<br />What makes this film worth it?  It's a decent ride if you take it straight at face value and fast foward through any scene that requires extensive dialogue.  And it has some saving points.  I found the twins to be probably the most interesting aspect, with the addition of the ditched/old/obsolete programs subplot to be quite interesting.  And if nothing else, the highway and Architect scenes are wonderful.  But those are two out of a lengthy movie.  It's fun, but our esteemed directors can do so much better.  Stick with the first movie.
B000002UAX|4.0|This is the Beatles return to old form after a few years of experimentation, right? Wrong. Check the abundance of styles on this album and try and tell me they weren't experimenting. It starts with a fun Beach Boys rip-off (Back in the USSR) and ends with the orchestral lullaby of Good Night. And while most of this genre-bending album works, many pieces just don't work very well. <br />Every Beatle has a writing stint on this album and, likewise, every Beatle has his marvelous tracks and every Beatle has his piffle. Although John also has the best tracks on the album, he made mistakes along the way with self-referential Glass Onion, the overwrought Bungalow Bill, and penning the aforementioned Good Night, as sung by Ringo. He also penned Birthday with McCartney, a loud Motown-ish mistake. McCartney also wrote I Will, which is a pleasant, but not by any means stellar, little love song. Lastly, George wrote the nothing-great Long, Long, Long and Ringo sang Good Night. <br />Don't get me wrong, though; this album should still be considered a classic. Every other song by John is remarkable, true masterpieces, especially the irreverant Happiness is a Warm Gun, traditional rocker I'm So Tired, and Maharishi-shunning Sexy Sadie. McCartney strikes a nice chord with the vaudevillian Martha, My Dear, soul-tinged Why Don't We Do It in the Road, and the early heavy-metal Helter Skelter. All three of George's other songs are great; getting Eric Clapton to do the guitar work on While My Guitar Gently Weeps was a truly inspired choice. Finally, Ringo's Don't Pass Me By is a fun country-influenced song that also happens to be his first full writing credit. <br />All in all, this album is a flawed masterpiece that with enough variety to fill a few more records. This is the album in which the Beatles began to crumble. Just listen to Revolution 9 and try and tell me it doesn't give off the impression that the Beatles are dying. That is part of what makes the White Album what it is, for better or worse.
B00005JKC3|2.0|The Incredible Hulk with rising star, Eric Bana (Finding Nemo), Jennifer Conolly, and a great performance by Nick Nolte. Unlike Spider-Man and Daredevil, The Hulk has a small time starring actor. The Hulk was truely a disapointment for me. It moved too fast, the story was hard to follow, but non-the-less, great performances. If your a big Hulk fan, you should watch it. The action scenes are good but the story and dialogue just screwed it up. With a great director like Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) this movie looked like it would be a hit but instead just a disapointment.
B000068OCS|4.0|My interest in KOYA (Koyaanisqatsi) and the Qatsi trilogy was sparked after watching a video called \\"Baraka\\" (1993) filmed by Ron Fricke, who is also the DP for KOYA. Fricke, however is not the DP for POWA (\\"Powaqqatsi [1988]) or NAQO (Naqoyqatsi [2002]). I relate to this form of filmmaking (aka \\"eye candy\\") since I too am a visual person working in film media.<br />KOYA isn't for the movie- goer who uses movies to forget about the world and sit through 87 minutes of fantasy. Nor is it for the lover of explosions, chases and climactic scenes that most filmmakers and studio execs thrive on these days. There are implosions and explosions here. But what sets these apart is that it isn't make- believe. It is happening all the time, in our world right now, even though this movie was created in 1983. While mankind slowly takes control over the world, we see through Fricke's filming that we are actually out of control. And some people can feel rather uncomfortable having such images thrust in their faces.<br />Watch this DVD only when you've had sufficient rest. If you are at all sleepy (or restless, even), put the disc aside and find something else to do until your mind is clear and you're ready to commit your full attention to KOYA. Otherwise you won't be able to appreciate the film. Also, you may want to hold off watching KOYA if you are living with depression since this film does nothing to lift up one's spirit or offer a sense of hope at the end.<br />I think of KOYA (and the other films that Fricke embarked on) as a moving painting. So many people will gaze upon it and each one will have a different reaction to it. Look at the many different reviews that have been posted so far. And you'll see that in over 100 reviews posted for KOYA alone, each one is quite interesting and even unique. Some are rather passionate, even about what they feel is the correct film aspect ratio. Art has this same kind of effect. It can be either exquisite or trash. But no one is unmoved by KOYA (or the Qatsi trilogy or Baraka, for that matter). I can't predict if you'll like, hate, envy, despise, or even be born again. I can only tell you that you'll feel something. And you will look at things a little (or much more) differently that you do now.<br />The music by Philip Glass at times sounds outdated now (especially with KOYA being 20 years old). The strange thing, however, is that Philip's composition can sound more outdated than other electronic music has been composed years before his.<br />I give POWA 4 stars because it simply isn't a total success with its moments of weakness. I do suggest that you watch the \\"qatsi\\" trilogy in order; start with KOYA, then view Powaqqatsi (1988), and then complete your journey with Naqoyqatsi (2002). But no matter what, I urge you to consider \\"Baraka,\\" currently my favorite film of this type and what I consider an essential DVD. Fricke expanded his filming to capture an intimate vision of humanity (good and bad), adding this with nature and technology and capturing it all in 70mm true letterbox (2.35:1).<br />The DVD I have (I purchased the 2-DVD POWA/KOYA set) has not even a pamphlet in either DVD. There was a video with interviews of the director and composer, but I wished that the DVD had included an interview with Fricke.by KOYA (or the Qatsi trilogy or Baraka, for that matter).

B000002OR4|5.0|One of the most powerful movies made in the last 15 years, Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List gave John Williams a chance to eschew his normally operatic style in film scoring and to prove that simplicity and restraint can add more power to a film than a huge symphonic score.  Instead of choosing heavy brooding Nazi-style marches or heroic Indiana Jones-like themes for the various characters, Williams chose instead to go for a subdued style, using solo piano, children's choirs, and poignant violin solos by the great Itzhak Perlman to underscore the horrors of the Holocaust and the eventual humanization of Oskar Schindler.<br />Williams' \\"Theme from Schindler's List\\" is a poignant composition that has its roots in the musical style favored by Eastern European Jews. That Williams can write scores using forms and instrumentation used by other cultures is not surprising. Williams, after all, won his first Academy Award for adapting the music from Broadway's \\"Fiddler on the Roof\\" for the movie version, and his score for Ron Howard's \\"Far and Away\\" employs Irish melodic forms quite effectively.  The \\"Theme\\" is hauntingly beautiful, and it matters not whether it's performed by the entire Boston Symphony, a solo pianist, or Perlman on violin.<br />Another lovely yet melancholic piece is \\"Remembrances,\\" which appears twice on this CD.<br />\\"Immolation  (With Our Lives, We Give Life)\\" is a moving, keening choral piece, while \\"Oyf'n Pripetshok and Nacht Aktion\\" mingles a traditional Jewish song and original Williams material to underscore the Germans' \\"cleansing\\" of the Krakow Ghetto.<br />Ending the album's 13 tracks are the \\"Yeroushalaim Chel Zahav (Jerusalem of Gold),\\" performed beautifully by the Ramat Gan Chamber Choir, \\"Remembrances,\\" reprised by Itzhak Perlman, and the piano-and-orchestra reprise version of \\"Theme from Schindler's List.\\"<br />John Williams earned his fourth Best Original Score Oscar for this gentle and evocative work, and I recommend this album for fans of either the composer or film music in general...or even serious classical music listeners.fans of either the composer or film music in general...or even serious classical music listeners.
B000002572|5.0|Terrific debut album from Boston. All of the songs are well written and performed. I still remember the first time I heard \\"More Than A Feeling\\" in 1976, I was 11 years old. Oh, the 70's what a great decade for music.

B0000024LN|5.0|I've read some of these reviews and I can't believe there hasn't been any mention of What You Looking 4. It has the illest beat on the album and Redman actually has a message in his songs. It's about feds who are on his back all the time just because he's making money and says they should be after real criminals. Every song is a classic. As far as skills go Redman is ahead of Biggie and 2Pac.

B0000026VZ|3.0|I like Toto, and I think they are the most fabulous rock band of all time. The only songs I like from greatest hits tape were, well just the classics. Toto was THE hottest band ever with either Bobby Kimball or Joseph Williams as lead singer. But Jean-Michael Byron? Man, please!! I just got thru reading couple of websites, and I realized why Toto made a big mistake of hiring Byron. 4 songs \\"Love Has The Power,\\" \\"Out Of Love,\\" \\"Animal,\\" and \\"Can You Hear What I'm Saying\\" don't move me, baby. I read that both Byron and Toto didn't get along during tour. Plus he was trying to be the next Michael Jackson when he was moving on stage, embarrassing both Toto and the fans. I didn't see it, but if I did I would have laughed ... Now the classic songs, like \\"Africa,\\" \\"Georgy Porgy,\\" \\"Rosanna,\\" \\"I'll Be Over You,\\" and \\"Pamela\\" I can dig, but I didn't like those 4 songs with Byron. He was kicked out of band after tour in 1991, and Steve Lukather took double duties both as lead singer & guitarist. Thank God they brought Bobby Kimball back in band in 1998.

B000001ESN|5.0|...excluding Neil Peart's entry into the band.<br />Mostly recorded in 1979, PERMANENT WAVES (1980) marked the starting point for Rush's full-blown entry into condensed, accessible progressive rock. They abandoned the 20-minute suites and mystical lyrics for catchy progressive song structures, and more human, worldly-related topics. But, Geddy Lee (vocals/bass/synths), Alex Lifeson (guitars) and Neil Peart (drums/lyrics) didn't lose their brilliance in composition, even if most of the track lengths were fit for radio.<br />&quot;The Spirit of Radio&quot; is an ever-popular track, and seems to still get as much radio airplay as it did over two decades ago. A catchy, melodic track with cerebral lyrics dealing with no other than the radio, and it's effect on us listeners (i.e. music fans.)<br />&quot;Freewill&quot; is a philosophical rocker dealing with personal beliefs (e.g., god, fate, stars) and the consequences - positive or negative - of them. Neil Peart seems to be quite ambiguous in his lyrics, and you can't necessarily tell what *his* personal beliefs are at times. He seems to be playing more a role of devil's advocate, which in some cases is probably the smartest part to play.<br />&quot;Jacob's Ladder&quot; brings slight resemblance to Rush's 70s period, as this is the most *proggish* on the album, and more than likely can please fans of that particular period. Mostly instrumental, it's an atmospheric rocker which leans toward the darker and heavier side. Highlights of the track are the instrumental section in 5/4, and later, a spatial, instrumental section featuring guitarist Alex Lifeson (later joined by band) playing a snaky riff in 13/8, while Neil is keeping time nicely, and Geddy lends some darkly airy synths on top it all. This track bears considerable King Crimson influence, though clearly, it's still Rush's trademark sound.<br />&quot;Entre Nous&quot; is something of a ballad, but with intellectual-oriented lyrics. Alex Lifeson's trademark atmospheric arpeggios, Geddy's subtle, but commanding vocal combine nicely to make a highly compelling track.<br />&quot;Different Strings&quot; is the soft tune on the album. Though possibly seen as a warm up to the following track, it stands nicely on it's own. Poignant as well.<br />&quot;Natural Science&quot; is the other most *proggish* number on the album. Written in three sections, the lyrics mostly deal with nature and the enviornment. Complex musicianship is very apparent, but doesn't overshadow the strangely catchy and  addicting elements found here.<br />This would be a perfect place to start for anyone interested in Rush. Features a nice balance of complex musicianship and accessibility that's hard to beat.

0553278223|2.0|I've heard this book referred to as a &quot;masterpiece of science fiction&quot; more than once, often from sources that suggest it isn't simply publishers' hype. After having actually read it, I cannot understand why. Bradbury's characters, by and large, are pretty thin. That might be forgivable if he were writing in order to set a mood or make some kind of interesting point, but his writing style tries too hard to be poetic, and his ideas are mostly pretty trite. There are quite a lot of books that cover colonial insenstivity, nuclear war, and the supposed meaninglessness or self-destructiveness of modern life, and Bradbury's doesn't stick out from the crowd.<br />This could be partly because the book doesn't fully cohere. I know that it is supposed to be a connection of linked short stories, not a traditional novel, but Bradbury seems to have frequently changed his mind about the most fundamental aspects of his version of Mars. I might not mind this if I thought he was trying to make a point by presenting radically different kinds of Martians at different times, but that wouldn't be consistent with his somewhat superifical handling of many of the other ideas in the book.<br />There are several stories in The Martian Chronicles that do succeed, and I suspect I would have been more impressed with it if I had read it when it came out. I can certainly see how it could seem impressive to someone who had read little or no science fiction, or literature in general. Still, it didn't have a lasting effect on me, and it looks pretty anemic next to, say, Ursula K. LeGuin or Gene Wolfe. If you are new to science fiction, I would refer you to one of those authors, or to a number of others. They have more interesting things to say than Bradbury.
B000002J03|5.0|Coming so quickly after LED ZEPPELIN (1969), the boys decided to hop into the studio, and record a second album. It was reported somewhere that the boys wanted to capture the energy of their live performances on this disc. It's safe to say that they came close, as every song on the album is a rocker.<br />I strongly agree with the reviewer below: this is probably the Zeppelin album even non-fans will be thoroughly pleased with, as there are not many soft ballads, folky numbers and other such things that may irritate many, other than the most dedicated Zeppelin fan. Simply put: this is Zeppelin rocking from the very first second of the disc, to the very last second of the disc.<br />LED ZEPPELIN II (1969) is a blockbuster album from beginning to end. I don't really think there's a track on here that's hard to dislike. This is an album that the majority of music lovers can possibly agree on positively, and I honestly don't think I can say that about any other Zeppelin disc, as the others are diverse which can have many divided on opinions. The differences of opinion regarding Zeppelin's tracks seem to be at their lowest on this particular album.<br />\\"Whole Lotta Love\\" is a sex-tinged rocker with Jimmy Page's electricity-filled riffing. The main riff was reported to be stolen from one of Willie Dixon's songs (Dixon happened to be one of Zeppelin's influences.) Dixon filed a lawsuit against Zeppelin and won. Other than that, the track is quite intoxicating and addicting.<br />\\"What Is And What Should Never Be\\" is a poignant, soul-stirring R&B-meets-hard rock/metal track. One of Zeppelin's very best, and a favorite of mine. Probably one of the earliest forms of what would later be known as the \\"power ballad.\\"<br />\\"The Lemon Song\\" is another track filled with sexual innuendoes, while Jimmy Page's riffing tends to mimic Robert Plant's vocals. Many will remember this swapping of riffs & vocals on their debut album.<br />\\"Thank You\\" may be the most mellow track on the album, though it rocks out fairly well. A poignant ballad with a summer romance-type of atmosphere to it.<br />\\"Heartbreaker\\" is a love tale featuring Jimmy Page's addicting, crunchy, infectious riffs, Robert's convincing vocal, and a nifty solo from Page in the middle of the track. A smash in my book.<br />\\"Living Loving Maid (She's Just A Woman)\\" is a short, invigorating R&B-infused rocker/romper. Addicting as well.<br />\\"Ramble On\\" shows Jimmy Page's love of blending acoustic guitar parts with electric guitar parts. Has a reflective, countryesque feel to it, particularly in the softer moments. A melodic beauty.<br />\\"Moby Dick\\" is written by John Bonham, and as you may have guessed, is mostly a showcase for his intricate and explosive drumming. Fans (of Bonham, and dynamic, aggressive drumming) will love the wild drum soloing in the middle of the track, and to think some of this drumming is used by his bare hands, as opposed to using drumsticks. Though mostly a Bonham showcase, band interplay takes place before, and after the extended drumming section, although the band interplay doesn't last very long.<br />\\"Bring It On Home\\" is a tasty, blues-injected number. The ony fault I find in this track is that it's too short. It's over four minutes, but you'd wish that the electric part of the song would have lasted a bit longer, as it starts off with some soft bluesy chords for about two minutes, then the tasty electric part swallows you whole, and before you know it, it's over. Other than that small issue, it's an excellent closer.<br />This album is recommended to even the most cynical Zeppelin fan, as there are rarely any soft numbers that can bug staunch fans of the harder stuff. Many will already own this by now, but on the chance that a novice stumbling upon this page has an interest in Zeppelin, but doesn't know where to begin, this would be a perfect place to start.m, though it rocks out fairly well.

B0000BYM3K|5.0|Fans around the world rejoiced when vocalist Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith rejoined the band they helped make famous.  They produced &quot;Brave New World&quot; (2000) which proved to be a strong effort and a beginning in which they will hopefully erase a decade of poor albums.  They followed that with an excellent live offering, &quot;Rock In Rio&quot; (2001), and despite its questionable tracklist still was an awesome performance.  Maiden's proving to the world WHY they're among the greatest metal bands in existence and that they can still rock hard and ride free with all the bands out there that worship them.  This year (2003, in case you're reading this a year later), they release &quot;Dance of Death.&quot;  Maiden still brings us oldschool goodness!  In fact, the whole album sounds like &quot;Seventh Son's&quot; cohesiveness, &quot;Piece of Mind's&quot; lyrical and epic approach, and &quot;Number of the Beast's&quot; meaty musicianship.  I've noticed a lot of supposedly (I use that word sarcastically) die hard fans that wanted an album like this, yet when it comes, what do they do?  &quot;Same old, same old.&quot;  Bah.  While this album is not revolutionary for them, it DOES confirm that they will never sell out and will continue rocking on for hopefully another decade.  Now, let's get on with the tracklist:<br />Wildest Dreams - an awesome rocker that kicks off the album.  While not as awesome as many of the later tracks, this is still a fine radio-friendly metal piece.  Highly recommended.<br />Rainmaker - My personal favorite!  This excellent rocker manages to be radio-friendly yet it exploits the triple-guitar feature decently well.  Dave Murray's solo is one of his best.  Gotta love that chorus.<br />No More Lies - This one's an interesting track and it's the first on the album that's long.  Brilliantly crafted by Steve Harris, this one reminds me of Blood Brothers from &quot;Brave New World&quot; and The Clansman from &quot;Virtual Xi.&quot;  The only thing that brings it down a little is its repetitive chorus... still, I loved The Wicker Man, so this is no biggie to me.<br />Montsegur - A song based on the infamous battle, this one's pretty good with some excellent lyrics.  Definitely pleasing to the die hard Maiden fan.<br />Dance of Death - The monstrous title track that's 8 minutes in length.  Very orchestral in tone and it's one of the best tracks on this album.  Highly recommended.  Bruce's vocals are EXCELLENT here, unlike what some other reviewers have said.<br />Gates of Tomorrow - An interesting arrangement that almost sounds like their early punk days.  Pleasant, with Bruce's vocals in fine form.  Unlike many reviewers, I thought Janick Gers's solo here was excellent.<br />New Frontier - Very meaty with some excellent lyrics contributed by drummer Nicko McBrain.  This one seems to be underrated by the Maiden fans; don't know why.<br />Paschendale - My other favorite!  Lyrics wise, it almost sounds like the logical part 2 to their &quot;Piece of Mind&quot; classic The Trooper, but musically it's more orchestral.  This one's already a fan favorite and I can definitely see why.<br />Face in the Sand - OO, another great track.  Awesome vocals and interesting foreign-sounding guitar work, this one seems like The Nomad Part 2.<br />Age of Innocence - HIGHLY UNDERRATED.  Doesn't stand out as far as instrumentation goes, but the heartfelt lyrics and Bruce belting them out is quite extroadinary.<br />Journeyman - Closing out the album is a soaring epic of grand proportions.  The triple-guitar assault is utilized well here.<br />Overall, this is a VERY strong effort from the great Iron Maiden.  I don't understand many of the fans and some of the critics; they just don't get it.  This will no doubt become a classic years from now.  I can't really name any flaws about it, except for perhaps the fact that its mix sounds a bit more raw as opposed to the crisp sound &quot;Brave New World&quot; had.  Still, Maiden is still strong and they got my 5 stars.  I HIGHLY recommend this to the Maiden fan, and perhaps those first getting into Maiden., Maiden is still strong and they got my 5 stars.  I HIGHLY recommend this to the Maiden fan, and perhaps those first getting into Maiden.
B00003CXXM|4.0|What I really like about this film is that it doesn't take itself seriously at all.<br />The fast-paced fight scenes aren't at all believable.  The main character has skills comparable to an entire team of highly trained operatives.  The good news is that these outrageous elements blend right in with the light-hearted nature of the film.<br />This film is refreshing in a time when the plots of most action films focus on some dreary &quot;oh, no, I'm facing yet another apocalypse!&quot;
B00005JLSE|1.0|Wow.  I had heard so much about this movie and all I can say is...don't believe the hype.  It was terrible.  Renee Zellweger is a pasty faced wanna-be, and Richard Gere is just...ick.  Good God...who told this man he could sing and dance let alone act? <BR>The only saving grace of this movie if Queen Latifah, and that's only because she's mildly humerous.<BR>Catherine Zeta Jones was alright, but she didn't deserve and Oscar...and neither did this over rated piece of tripe.<BR>The movie is dark, depressing, and lacking any originality.  I hated this movie.
0060005424|5.0|I was so excited when i fianlly read Sabriel and then Lireal right after that. I had no idea that there was a third book, and oh course i didn't look at the last page of Lireal until i got the the last page of the climax and it said Epilogue. I wanted to cry cause i didn't know that Abhorsen was out yet, thankfully it is. I am still so psyched to read the third, because Lireal was so amazing. In short I laughed I cried and i can't wait to see what happens next. It was truly worth everyminute of my time. Lireal is really insipring and wonderful. I love the idea of the Clayr, and walking dead. It seems like an actual place. Like Nix was like the unseen traveler in this Old Kingdom writing everything down while adventuring with both Lireal and Sameth. And oh yeah he talks about Sabriel and Touchstone, i love those two.
B000002JKA|3.0|Awake was the first Dream Theater CD I bought after the incredible Images and Words release, and while it's not exactly a bad album, it doesn't hold a candle to the magic that happened with Images and Words.  There are a few great songs in which the Images and Words magic does come through a bit, but for the most part I felt the album was uninspired and labored.  What I mean by labored is sometimes Dream Theater puts so much emphasis on lyrics and trying to get a message through that the music part of the equation suffers and just becomes mechanical.  High points of the CD include Hell's Kitchen, Space Dye Vest, and Lifting Shadows off a Dream. Low points include songs like Voices, which just make me want to kill myself, they're so empty.  If you're looking to pick up some Dream Theater stuff, go with Images, Change of Seasons, or Scenes from a Memory.  You won't be sorry.l

B0000BYM3K|5.0|And for those of you that have trash talked this album, did you actually listen to it??? I myself am a musician and a lifelong fan of iron maiden, and on this album they have truly expanded as a band trying a different approach. like the song journeyman, it is the first acoustic maiden song ever! and it is definitly an awesome song!!  Just because Iron maiden didn't sell out and down tune they're guitars, like metallica, makes them by far a much better band. The complexity of the songs are incredible. The solos are incredible! I find it hard to beleive that someone actually thought up these awesome songs. In this album I find that there are NO filler songs- songs that are put on just to fill up the album. It is definitlly two steps forward from Brave New World. Any true musician who knows what they are talking about can't say anything bad about this album because it is definitlly an album that can withstand the test of time! So stop your crying because it dosn't sound like slipknot, or any other band that really dosn't know how to play their instruments! Buy this album, listen to the feeling they put across and you'll be have to pick your jaw up off the ground, just as I had to!  <br />UP THE IRONS!!!!!!!
0393312836|4.0|Has anyone read &quot;Animal Farm&quot;? That book is the worst anti-socialism propaganda ever written. It was as anti-capitalist as it was anti-communist and it appeared to make a point.<br />Burgess tells a tale that is anti-facism, anti-capitalism, andti-communism... anti-ism!! One of the more amazing novels written in the twentieth century, the fact that it is short and still brutally effective is its most amazing attribute. What Burgess has done with this novel is actually change the idea of what literature can be. He dances on the edge of de-construction without crossing over the line.<br />The language is incredibly anguishing to read, but at the end of the first few chapters, you realize that the effect of this &quot;translating&quot; that you have to do, you begin to think exactly like Alex. You feel complete empathy with his feelings. Its actually rather chilling when you think about it.<br />Anyone who enjoyed the way in which this novel was written should pick up &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; by William S. Burroughs.
076790592X|4.0|I'm the odd duck who didn't LOVE this book. Yeah, yeah, it was sad and sweet and touching and all that. But it's a cliche to have an old man on his deathbed imparting hard-earned wisdom to a brash young comer. I probably would have liked Morrie, actually, but I think I'd have emphasized a different side of him, if I'd been writing about him. This reads too much like the ubiquitous Chicken Soup series. Too much of a good thing, even truly good things, is still too much. I'm over it.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|YES, the eighties are over and Iron Maiden has moved through their Jurassic period and onward ... which saw the world presented with some of the best (and smartest) metal ever, through their low period without Bruce D, to their brilliant rebirth back with (singer) Bruce D. and \\"Brave New World\\" followed by \\"Rock in Rio\\", establishing them once again as the best of the best in metal, to now offering up \\"Dance of Death\\".<br />Simply put: It is a GOOD piece of work, by a band that still is one of the best working these days!<br />A  rocking bunch of tunes, smoking anything else out there!<br />This batch of songs sees the whole band having a hand in the songwriting process as well.  Yes, the cover art and songs are different, but who wants these guys to stand still and do the same old...It doesn't quite hit the highs of \\"Brave New World\\", or \\"Rock in Rio\\", not to mention classic Maiden (\\"Powerslave\\", or \\"Number of the Beast\\", to name just a few) but still leagues above most metal releases these days.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|This film containes true brilliance. It is able to surpass the first in that it has a beautiful love story, pasionate performances from the actors, and you will want to see it again. This is a film that gets better and better upon viewing. It is funny, suspensful, and moving. The best out there.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|highly recommand new maiden fan to start listen with this one , or Brave new world !!
B00005JM03|4.0|This was one of those rare movies for me that was able to hold my attention for the entire duration of the film.
B00005A46T|5.0|I read some of the reviews on this board and felt compelled to write this.  Ok, Spliknot is not Slater, but they hard NOT Nu Metal!  This metal has some killer songs which make you just want to jump up and down in place they are so hard.  There are great rifts and the vocals add to the ferocity of the songs themselves.  This album is great to vent and to work out to.  It is absolutely hardcore.
B000069HK2|5.0|This cd is amazing.After hearing &quot;box of sharp objects&quot; which is a great song I had to hear what other songs they had,and let me tell you I have to say that it is probably the best cd I have ever heard.Berts (lead singer) voice is so unusual he makes the songs sound so incredibly good!!!Out of all the 12 songs the best songs are &quot;the taste of ink&quot;,&quot;noises and kisses&quot;,and &quot;bulimic&quot;.Simply because they have such good beats,and not to mension great lyrics.Lets make this short and sweet if you don't already get this cd!!!I mean it!!!
B00005JLYW|4.0|I was surprised to see so many one star reviews for this movie.  Personally I really thought it was good, but being a Lucy Liu fan makes a difference.  I thought the second one was as good as the first -and it was more sexy.
B000092ZYX|5.0|You want to know how good it is?<BR>Mix OK Computer, Kid A, and Amnesiac.<BR>This is what you would get.<BR>The album is beautiful, melodic, depressing, angstful, fun, diverse, expirimental, gut-wrenchingly intense, captivating, and absolutely brilliant.<br />It opens up with a sudden guitar amp plug-in and then Thom's perfectly toned moaning in '2+2=5' which goes from a quiet fog of a song to a romping roller coaster of guitar, drums, and fun vocals.<BR>The album only picks up from there.<BR>It goes into the depressing, intense, and captivating sounds of 'Sit Down Stand Up', 'Sail To The Moon', 'Where I End and You Begin', 'The Gloaming', and 'I Will'.<BR>It also carries the catchy, guitar-ish sounds of 'Go To Sleep', 'There There' and 'Myxomatosis', and the dark techno beat of 'Backdrifts'.<br />Grade: A+
B00000K19E|5.0|This is a great movie about an inner journey; Where Neo wants to free his mind. Neo is the chosen one of course, because it is himself its all about. The ship is his body, Morpheus is his common sense, Trinity is his love and he got one corrupted guy in him who is called Cypher and he wants to give up and stop struggling. The one who's looking into the matrix is his conscious and he has a hard time to see what's going on in this world because it's so much information in this world who hypnotizes the human mind. Most of the people is not unplugged, with other words hypnotized, and he is struggling very hard(against Agent Smith, his speech is slow - and has an hypnotic effect - to not fall into hypnotic stage, suggestions, manipulation, projections etc.)And then we got the Oracle (subconscious) who knows everything about him of course, she shows him the way where he has all the old agreements in his life to understand a certain (western) reality.<br />He just wants to free his mind, where he is a prisoner and has boundaries into time, agreements, opinions and properties.
0679735909|1.0|Here's another one of those prize winning books that leave you wondering....<br />Why?
B0000640SA|5.0|I kept wanting to hit pause and think about this one, as the backwards story-telling can get to be a bit much at times.  It certainly was worth it, though, to get to the end (actually, the beginning) and see what the filmmakers had accomplished.  The acting is very good here, and the characters are all believable and fascinating.  The most fascinating thing about it is that they've created a film that mirrors the main character's method of keeping track of things--they've made a series of snapshots that continue to answer questions about something we know but don't have any memory of.  And without ruining the ending, they've made us doubt or question virtually everything we've seen up until the final frame.  We'll never know who Leonard truly is or what he's truly done, but this film is a great ride to get to the end (beginning) of the road.
B00009P1O0|5.0|I just got this CD yesterday. I'm a relatively new Neil Young fan, meaning I wasn't around to get the Vinyl, but I'm as dedicated as anyone I've known.<br />This is truly a great album. It's very refreshing and some of the coolest Neil Young work I've ever heard. The music is more mellow than a lot of Neil's other works but it's very good and it makes me want to go lay out on a beach at midnight when I listen to it. I reccomend it for any fan of Neil Young, but I think it's also more of a general album for people who may not be fans of Neil Young.
0812968255|5.0|Marcus Aurelius was an emperor of Rome. He was bought up in the stoic philosophical tradition of many of the Roman upper classes. However, for Marcus philosophy in all its forms was a life-long passion.<br />What we have here are essentially note books written by Marcus on lessons he has learnt from life, drawn from his background as an emperor, general and relatively unknown person when he was younger.  They are the result of a life time of thought on the human condition and mortality.  He often goes over similar themes, refining what he has to say, which means at times the book can be a bit gloomy, but that does not invalidate the value of  his observations.<br />Gregory Hays has provided us with a new translation of Marcus's books taken from the preserved ancient Greek manuscripts.  We have been given a colloquial and unpretentious translation which falls in well with what Marcus has to say.  Having read this it is easy to see how these manuscripts have stood the test of time, and that what Marcus has to say is still of relevance today.<br />To see how little human nature has changed in over 2 thousand years, this book is an eye opener and should be part of any collection of classic titles.
B00008EY9G|5.0|Identity keeps you on your seat and actually surprises you at the end, which very few movies do nowadays.  I highly recommend it.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Arguably their best album, Radiohead's &quot;OK Computer&quot; is without a doubt one of the finest albums of the 90's.  The album's theme, the de-humanization of man through the evolution of machines, doesn't make the album any more accessible (it is all the more depressing to a point), but that's a good thing.  This isn't the accessible Radiohead that's been heard on the band's debut &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; or even on &quot;The Bends&quot;; this is an album that you can't achieve full listening pleasure from just by listening to one song, only when you listen to &quot;OK Computer&quot; from beginning to end can you fully appreciate the musicianship, complexity, and overall greatness of this fantastic album.  Standout tracks include &quot;Airbag&quot;, &quot;Exit Music (For a Film)&quot;, &quot;Karma Police&quot;, and &quot;Lucky&quot;, and as great as those songs are, the entire album in itself is a modern day masterpiece and one of the absolute greatest albums of the 90's.
B00005JLSE|1.0|I hate musicals being made into movies.  Song after song after song that has no relevance!  It makes me nutty.<BR> But I'm not even going to go there, because even without the annoyingly catchy little songs that will never leave your head, \\"Chicago\\" would have been a horrible waste of film and my time.  The best character in the entire movie was \\"Mr. Cellophane\\", poor guy.  I felt so sorry for him.  And yet we are meant to sympathize with Roxie, that horrible, spoiled, little twit that treats him like trash?  I think not.  I wanted to see her hanged!<BR> This review is, admittedly, not meant to be helpful.  I just wanted to help lower the four and a half star average costumer rating this bomb currently holds to something it deserves.  This is also a lovely little chance for me to spew feelings that build inside me, and make them known to the whole world without breaking a sweat!<BR> Don't let the academy fool you; 99% of movies made in 2002 were better than this one.
0156027321|5.0|From the wonderful theology in the beginning of the book through the whimsical and delightful Japanese interviewers at the end of the book, Yann Martel has written something really spectacular. Pi is a charming young man and he handles his life and adventure gracefully. Aside from a few grammatical errors (we no longer seem to have capable editors in this world), the writing is excellent  and outstanding. Often when I enjoy a book I am sorry to see it end but not this time. The book was complete when it finished and created a satisfying and meaningful reading experience. I hope there will be more novels.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|The big time critics put Greendale down simply because it is innovative and they want their review to be accepted by the mindless audiences. 1 or 2 years from the release of Greendale it will be held highly like Rust Never Sleeps, or Harvest Moon.<br />Some of the best work Neil Young's ever done. It immediatly got the #5 spot on my Neil Young top 5.<br />This album is like a novel, you have to read between the lines and there is a lot you can divulge if you try. However it has an edge over novels because if you do not want a story you can simply listen to the music at face good sound value. Devil's Sidewalk is one of Neil Young's bluesiest romps yet, Be The Rain is a rocker just like Rockin in the Free World or Cinammon Girl, Carmicheal has been said to be reminiscent of Cortez the Killer, and some of the style is very farmiliar with On The Beach. But don't worry if you're looking for something new, it's all new and it's got a ton of good riffs and charming melodies.<br />The story &amp; lyrics are superb, even border-line brilliant. Bandit is actually one of the most sentimental, meainingful, and touching songs Neil's done in his 30+ years as a genius recording artist, and is equal to classics from Harvest, After the Goldrush, and the less appreciated acoustics on Rust Never Sleeps like Thrasher.<br />Greendale is a story of a family, from Patriarch to youngest Child just reaching the age of adulthood. Some reviewers say it's about Sun Green but it isn't, it's about all of them equally. It contains memorable characters (including Neil's favorite the wise Grandpa) and is a truly entertaining story even once you've heard it many times.<br />This is definetly something for EVERY Neil Young fan, whether they are selective to some of his styles or a fan of Neil as an arttist. I'm hoping that a lot of these songs become regulars in both electric &amp; acoustic sets, and if ever a true Neil Young best of comes out it won't be completely without atleast some of Greendale.ale.
B000009HF2|5.0|FRAMPTON COMES ALIVE! is Peter Frampton's crowning achievement. It contains live versions of his early non-hits, and they sound even better on stage than in the studio. When you hear &quot;Do You Feel Like We Do&quot;, you know where Tesla lifted &quot;The Way It Is&quot; from. To start your Peter Frampton collection, get this one, GREATEST HITS, and THE VERY BEST OF PETER FRAMPTON- all at once.
B00005JLKB|3.0|I have to admit, this show is all right.  I think they could have  done a much, much better job with it than what they did do.  <br />Kristen Kreuk's acting is superb, but Tom Welling's seriously isn't. He's very artficial and doesn't really act.  Sure, he can furrow his brow and say \\"Dad, I feel so alone,\\" but he doesn't portray the character of Clark Kent, i.e. Superman, well at all.  He just says the line and kisses Lana and shoots fire from his eyes.  Is that acting?  Is that feeling the character from the soul?  I think not. <br />I also don't like it that each episode is like it's own little capsule and doesn't lead into the other episodes much. Sure, it maybe does a little, but not much and that's very unrealistic.  <br />I sometimes watch this show when it' on if I happen to see it becuase i do like everyone's acting except Tome Welling's and it is pretty intense sometimes.  The plots are sometimes a bit unreal and bit forced, but it is a decent show, just not one of my faves.
B00005A3KS|5.0|Everything about Point Break may seem ludicrous upon first glance, but thanks to having a more than competant director behind the camera (Kathryn Bigelow who helmed Near Dark, Strange Days, and K-19: The Widowmaker) and surprisingly great performances from Patrick Swayze, Keanu Reeves, and Gary Busey.  The story revolves around special agent Johnny Utah (Reeves) and his veteran partner (Busey) on the trail of a group of mysterious bank robbers who wear masks of ex-presidents.  Soon enough, Reeves infiltrates a group of surfers (led by Swayze) who are believed to be linked to the robbers.  The performances are great, especially Swayze who gives one of his last high profile film performances before his career began to decline.  The fantasticly shot skydiving and surfing sequences are worth the price of admission alone, and Bigelow manages to nicely orchestrate some great action scenes.  Although it didn't fare very well at the box office, to this day Point Break continues to garner a cult following thanks to home video and television.  All in all, if you love action films with some actual intelligence behind them and have never seen Point Break, then you should definitely give this a look.
0792833236|4.0|It takes an actor, only the rank of Robert De Niro, to perfectly play the role of a violent, mercurial guy, who has no clue whatsoever of what he has to do with his life. Moreover, only an actor like De Niro can play the part of a well toned, energetic boxer, and also fatten himself up at the same time, to play the role of the same well toned energetic pugilist when all he cares about is glutting himself up and being slothful to the point of being indifferent. All the more, it takes a director, the caliber of Scorsese to make De Niro do all of these things.<br />Scorsese is a master of disturbing movies. His movies are subtle, yet disturbing. In \\"Raging Bull\\", he has perfectly captured the deranged character of Jack La Motta, and has chosen the perfect person to enact this character. The movie is uncomplicated, but the fights are not. Each moment of La Motta's various fights seems to be crafted diligently and with perfection. The fights are violent, but not gory. But, the blood-spills of the fights, even in black-and-white seem quite distressing. Of course, De Niro acts fantastically, even, and especially during his boxing scenes.<br />The black-and-white look of the movie, enhancing the subfusc nature of it, actually helps one, focus fully on the intensity of the characters, especially since everything else around them seem so livid and wan. As a matter of fact, colors are used symbolically by the artful Scorsese. The majority of the movie is pretty depressing. Hence, the movie is colorless, for the major part of it. However, the movie has a five-odd minute patch, which is shot in color. In fact, the `colored' part, is the only positive part of the movie, which actually is a phantasmagoria of shots, showing positive things happening to lives of the Motta brothers. <br />\\"Raging Bull\\" is quite a depressing movie; there is no doubt about that. But, it is one of those movies, which is ought to be `studied' for its brilliant direction (especially the non-usage of colorproducing greater effect) and the acting, especially of Robert De Niro, who did seem to actually put a on lot of weight for the movie.
B00005JLRT|2.0|I love Star Trek, but the director and Piller are at fault here.  Someone got the notion that they should go examine every other film that came before this one, and STEAL one good element from each of them, and make this mess.  The actors were walking through this film, just going through the motions.  I've worked in film, and have studied films for a long time, and it was obvious to me that the actors KNEW they were making a load...  As a viewer, and fan, you'll find yourself repeatedly thinking &quot;I've seen this before&quot; (because you HAVE), right down to the little unneccessary Jeep ride through the desert, reminiscent of the idiotic horsie-rides that Bill Shatner provided for us in a worse mess called Star Trek V.  THE DIRECTOR STUNK AND THE ACTORS PUT UP WITH IT AND IT SHOWS!  Picard freezing up like a tired old fool, right at the END when he's in a pinch? NONSENSE, this was completely out of character, as most of the characterizations were throughout this debacle.  Deanna Troi, a simpering, wimpering mess? BEEE-ESSSS!!  And hey, WE'VE SEEN DATA'S HEAD ON THE GROUND BEFORE!  Will Riker in a fight scene IDENTICAL to the falling scaffold scene that killed Kirk in Generations, right down to the rivets popping out of the walls? WHAT WERE THESE PEOPLE THINKING??  Jeez.... I wish they hadn't done this.  <br />Can I mention the blaring errors in continuity, right from the start?  RENT this thing, and in the opening scenes from the wedding (the scene was actually pretty good) you get to watch Wesley Crusher mysteriously seated at the wedding party head-table, wearing a uniform (didn't he become an intergalactic disembodied entity after leaving Star Fleet?) and aside from the fact that he gets not a mention, he keeps APPEARING AND DISAPPEARING depending on the angle of the shot! WTF??  <br />Oh, and by the way... clones are a tired &quot;schtick&quot;.  <br />Did this film have any redeeming value?  Perhaps, but overall, the outright thievery of plot elements fromprevious films is a sad disappointment, when there are so many other things they could've done. MAKE WILLIAM SHATNER'S BOOKS INTO FILMS BEFORE THE ACTORS GROW TOO OLD! This is the Star Trek universe after all, they can do what they want and explain it away in one scene or a voiceover!  Yes, I'm upset.
B000089CKH|5.0|it should be nada surf's let go.  not only does this album have wonderful songs within it, it also plays out as a unified album and sounds complete.  after hearing this album i also enjoyed the proximity effect more than i did before. paper boats is worth the price of the entire album.
B000001GQP|5.0|This has to be one of the finest works to ever listen to. A must have for any CD library collection.
B00008RV1L|5.0|While I never read the book the movie is based on, I've repeatedly heard the book's hard core fans declare the movie 'not violent enough'. The movie itself shows less graphic violence than 'Fight Club', and I would say the movie's rating has a lot more to do with the sex scenes than the violence.<br />The movie itself is a combination of a few genres. On one hand, there are many elements of a 'slasher flick'- serial killer, bloody killings, etc. There arew also elements of a black comedy, and a 'psychological' element - we do get into Patrick Bateman's psyche, especially towards the end of the movie.<br />But even with all these elements, I felt that most of all, this was a period piece - about the &uacute;pper class Manhatten social group, where getting a good table at the 'best'restaurant becomes an almost life or death issue, and surface and first impressions meant everything. Success was decided based on a person's platinum credit card, his business card, the blondness (and dumness) of his girlfriend, but most of all - on his ability to get a 'res'at the best restaurants.<br />There were very few special features on this DVD, mostly the standard (cast & crew, trailer, behind the scenes featurette, etc.). The interview with Christian Bale was enlightning, but is no substitute for a commentary.
B000E1MTYU|4.0|HD definitely does wonders for these kind of action movies. It really brings them to life, and does them justice. I did originally see it at the cinema, but HD certainly comes second to seeing a film at the cinema. It's THAT good.<br /><br />The film is actually R-rated in America, but was only 12A here. The previous two were 15's, so I thought were gory/violent bits cut out of T3. I seriously didn't notice whether there was anything cut. On a second watching, maybe, but I really wasn't looking for cuts. You have to feel sorry for Arnie throughout this film, he really gets a rough ride.<br /><br />The film starts off like T2 - except it's John Conner talking about the future, rather than Sarah Conner, who doesn't appear in this film. I'm glad she refused to do it, especially after her appearance in T2 - she did NOT look right with those muscles. To explain her disappearance, she was killed off (charming). She simply appeared via a coffin. Nick Stahl, who does a great job of taking over from Edward Furlong, plays John Conner. I will always know Nick Stahl from `The Man Without A Face', where he played opposite Mel Gibson. He was a lot younger in that film, but he still looks the same, even with stubble, and looks a tiny bit older.<br /><br />When the TX appears, played by \\"model\\" (and boy, can you see it!) Kristianna Loken, I was glad that I wasn't in the cinema with a bunch of teenage guys, who would have probably started wolf whistling. She does appear naked for the first couple of minutes, and her hair is artfully brushed to cover her up, so nothing is seen. She scares the living daylights out of a woman, before taking over her car. She also manages to scrape her long hair back into a tight bun, which is very stereotypical for a female in this kind of film. She looks tough and hard-faced. I'd love to see the outtakes from this film, to see whether she does actually laugh during scenes, which then have to be cut out. She remains expressionless, and hardly speaks. Arnie speaks more in this film! And in any of the fight sequences, does a hair get harmed or get out of place on her blonde head? No way!<br /><br />Of course, Arnie appears naked too, and immediately walks into a strip club, full of screaming women. He tells the male stripper (who sounds obviously gay) to give him his clothes, and then dresses up in them. He pulls out the shades, which are star-shaped and look as though they've been borrowed from Elton John! Thankfully, he finds a cooler pair of shades. Arnie wouldn't be the Terminator without his shades. Not quite Matrix shades, but never mind.<br /><br />Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) plays an old schoolfriend of John Conner's, and it just so happens, that they \\"made out\\" in someone's basement. So there's a certain connection, although absolutely NO chemistry between them. She almost turns out to be a resurrection of Linda Hamilton's character, even John Conner comments on this! You need a tough female character (apart from stony-faced Kristianna), and Linda Hamilton filled that part very well, in the first two films. Now Claire Danes has taken over from her. She's a far cry from the only other role I've ever seen her in, that of Juliet in Baz Luhrmann's `Romeo & Juliet'.<br /><br />There are two, very obvious hints that there will be a T4, and personally, the format is getting a little tired now. You know the various Terminators are going to come back and try & kill off John Conner, and he's going to succeed each time. I don't think they can carry on with this story much longer, it will have been milked for all its worth by the end of the next film. And they should change the story - maybe set it in the future? (But would it still be called Terminator?) But what with the lovely Arnie being governor of California now, he obviously has lots more important things to do than star in another film.<br /><br />This is a great film, if you're a fan of the Terminator series. It's best if you have already seen T1 and T2 to get continuity of the film. It's easily my favourite, after watching them all a couple of times now.fter watching them all a couple of times now.

B000001G53|5.0|Is this the most beautiful music ever written?? Perhaps only Cosi Fan Tutte can rival the almost unbearable beauty of Wagner's last, and most intense, score. There's really nothing like it. Whenever I listen to this work I can hardly believe the sounds Wagner comes up with; the clarity and precision of the orchestration; the intense melodic beauty; that strange other-worldliness that seems to permeate every note, especially in Act Three. There are so many moments where you find your heart in your mouth over the transcendent beauty of the score, for example when Titurel's coffin is opened at the end of Act Three. Just a simple shift from minor key to major is awesome. So, what about Karajan's recording. Undoubtedly, it gets five stars for his conducting and the playing of the Berlin Philharmonic. Orchestral playing doesn't get any better than this. Yes, Karajan's conducting almost borders on the static at times, robbing the music of any dramatic power, but the power of Karajan's reading comes from a complete realisation of the spirituality of the music, a spirituality that is inextricably entwined in the work's beauty. It transfixes the listener in a unique way. It's an aesthete's dream come true! Kurt Moll's Gurnemanz is exceptionally well sung and holds the entire vocal performance together. It's wonderfully lyrical. Nimsgern's Klingsor is well-sung, if again undramatic but I loved Dunja Vejzovic's Kundry. Also, she gives the best mocking laughter in Act Two you can imagine! Modl is perhaps better in Knappertsbusch's 1951 Bayreuth recording. Windgassen in that recording is supreme, definitely far superior to Peter Hofmann's unpleasant, ugly, grating, shrill, strained, unmusical, rubbish effort as Parsifal. He really lets this performance down, but you have to make the judgement as to whether his failure puts you off the entire recording. I admit that it's a major drawback. Jose van Dam is good as Amfortas, no more, and not really as dramatically convincing as George London for Kna 1951. The digital recording brings an astounding clarity to the score. If you can live with Hofmann's Parsifal then get this extraordinary set. In fact, get it anyway, and also purchase Kna's 1951 Bayreuth set for a more dramatic reading, with acceptable but drastically less beautiful sound, that has just been released on Naxos's budget label.
B00009UW0N|5.0|Few horror films can claim to have profited as much from the DVD format as \\"Halloween\\", John Carpenter's original stock-and-slash masterpiece. It has been released countless times, with varying degrees of quality, both in terms of extras and the quality of the prints themselves. This 25th anniversary edition has perhaps the best extras available, although the altered color scheme (from previous prints) might displease some.<br />The movie needs no review, since it has been hailed as a masterpiece from the moment it was released back in 1978. What I will say is that, after seeing this movie hundreds of times, it is still creepy and effective at every turn. What many Halloween fans were disappointed with is that this 25th anniversary edition does not contain both the Theatrical and Extended Editions of the movie. So if you are looking for an all-inclusive package, you might want to give this edition a miss. Personally, I wasn't too bothered with the lack of the Extended edition. I have seen it and I don?t think it exactly blows the original out of the water. \\"Extended\\" doesn't always mean better, people. As for the altered color-scheme (with the spooky blue and brilliant oranges being dulled in the mastering), it didn't really bother me. In fact, I would say that this is the cleanest print of the movie I've seen.<br />The audio commentary from John Carpenter, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Debra Hill is excellent, but it apparently predates this release. It was recorded in the mid-90's for the Criterion Laserdisc (which is now a hot collector's item), and this is the first time seeing the light of day on DVD. It is full of the usual trivia, anecdotes, and side-stories. One cannot help but appreciate how the did so much with so little, as you'll learn from the commentary. The only drawback to the commentary is that all three participants were obviously recorded separately, and the often unevenly overlap each other.<br />The other big attraction is the 90-minute documentary \\"Halloween: A Cut Above The Rest\\".

B0000640SA|5.0|&quot;Memento&quot; is an absolute masterpiece of modern film. Christopher Nolan does a perfect job of capturing the emotion and despair of Leonard Shelby. See, the plot goes something like ths:<br />Shelby is happily married when someone breaks into his house and kills/rapes his wife, while in the process smashing his head against a mirror, damaging his brain and causing him to lose all short-term memory. Shelby then goes on a manhunt to avenge his wife's death. This is made much more difficult by the lack of police cooperation and his condition, which forces him to write himself endless notes, and, for the really important stuff, get tatoos made so he'll never forget.<br />This premise alone would be entertaining enough, but Nolan decided to do something a little different: He tells the story all backwards and out-of-order. At first this is quite confusing, as the viewer is forced to see things the way Leonard does - in 10-minute sections that reveal the developing plot, intercut with shorter sections that show scenes from Leonard's past. This is crucial to the meaning of the film.<br />So Leonard finds some assistance in Teddy (Joe Pantaliano - &quot;The Matrix) and Natalie (Carrie Anne-Moss &quot;The Matrix&quot;). The problem is, Leonard can never be sure if these &quot;friends&quot; are genuinely trying to help him, or taking advantage of him and his condition.<br />I can't really go into any more detail without giving away certain plot elements. Just do yourself a favor and rent, buy, borrow, steal, or bootleg this movie. &quot;Memento&quot; is one of the most exciting thrillers to come out in a loooong time, and will stand as a milestone in filmmaking for this century, and the next.
0156027321|5.0|This book is the most original work of fiction I have read in a long time.  Upon initial consideration, the subject matter seems too unconventional to be entertaining.  However, Martel successfully weaves a tale that is both thought provoking and immensely enjoyable to read.  Highly recommend!
B000089RVX|2.0|I give two stars only because the lead singer has a decent voice. Besides that this is cookie cutter modern rock. How long is everyone going to let Clear Channel and MTV force feed these overhyped , overproduced bands down your throats before you start demanding something original???
B00005Q4CS|2.0|I liked the mother character. She was the only interesting, new perspective. You felt sorry for her, for her loneliness as an elderly woman with a lousy son and no true friends. Her story was the only thing going for the movie.<br />However, the unrealistic portrayl of everything grawed at my brain. How come a lawyer didn't JUMP on the chance to sue the doctor for not treating the arm, instead of just reporting it to the cops? Or the prison authorities for not, during the absolutely REQUIRED medical exam prior to incarceration treat the arm? That made absolutely no sense. And, uhm, when was their trial? Their court-appointed lawyers? Even strung out \\"yankees\\" don't get thrown into jail in the South without evidence - where was that? Or was our perspective too drugged to preceive any of that? <BR>I'm also more inclined to believe the other poster about the inaccurate portrayl of the old woman's treatment in the psych center, as the movie, possibly the author, was just trying to go for the most shocking scenario, rather than the most realistic.<br />Oh, yeah, drugs are bad. Addiction R bad. Remember that, kids - heroin is not good for your system.

B00000JGHM|5.0|Michael Mann has created a classic with HEAT.<br />An all-star cast including the likes of Al Pacino, Robert Deniro, Tom Sizemore, and Val Kilmer + A tightly woven plot ripe with conflict, drama, and emotion + A 20 minute bank heist/shootout in the streets of LA = The perfect action drama.<br />The acting is top notch, as is the plot, but the action really takes the cake. The shootout in Los Angeles with fully automatic rifles has to be hands down one of the greatest action sequences ever shot on film. The handicam shots and ground level angles Mann employs put you right there in the center of the action and add to the realism of the scene.<br />This cat-and-mouse LA crime saga will definitely please all. The DVD is great quality and I recommend it to anyone who loves a tightly woven crime drama with awesome action scenes.

6305313687|3.0|Things I liked: <BR>Edward Norton<BR>B/W memories, technicolor present<br />Things I disliked:<BR>The lacking defense of \\"liberalism.\\" what was their defense? that nazis are wrong because they are violent, inconsistant, and will betray you? well, okay, that's a good reason for not joining a gang thereof, but the philosophy was not deconstructed AT ALL. The sister screams swear words at her brother, there's a winning defense. I want to know what \\"those books\\" were that changed his mind! Point out those \\"big holes\\" in the rhetoric! His arguments WERE convincing, that's because no one presented another side.<br />I also had a hard time figuring out the solutions this movie tried to present: stop the hatin', you whites, then blacks will stop the hatin'? What's the correct solution to the three blacks who beat the one white student? They weren't hating him for his whiteness, but they grouped together because they were black. How does one prevent that while pushing the message that you are special because of where your ancestors immigrated from?<br />I don't know, I thought the plot left a lot to be desired in realism and argument. The time-line also seemed really screwy. The sister's life, the one that rejects the racism her father has taught, is ignored. Why did she react differently? There were plenty of Nazi girls, it wasn't because she was a girl.<br />reviewers, note this:<BR>He did not just shoot at people who were trying to break into his car, he shot them, then violently, purposefully murdered one [remember that curb? that is not a normal reaction to seeing someone break into your car]. It is NOT defending your family to shoot to kill at people running away.<br />The word 'skinhead' was not mentioned in that movie once, for a reason, they didn't want to throw in a whole scene about the arguments between Neo-Nazi Skinheads and SHARP [Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice] - basically, a neo-nazi can be a skinhead, but a skinhead isn't necessarily a neo-nazi. Having hair, I don't express affiliation into either group, but I dislike over-broad labeling.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I came late to the camp of Johnny Cash. He caught my attention back with &quot;The Wanderer&quot; at the end of U2's Zooropa. And I knew he was something special. But youth is arrogant, and I passed him by, even when he did the first 3 great Amercian Recordings albums, one backed by Tom Petty. But I came to Johnny when I picked up a copy of Essential Johnny Cash, about a month ago, and I realized what true greatness was. I downloaded the video-clip to the song &quot;Hurt&quot; and I was shocked at how powerful it was-it brought tears to my eyes. Flash back to a couple of days ago, and I heard he died. It was tragedy. I went out and bought &quot;The Man Comes Around&quot; today-its the Cd of the year for me, maybe the one of the decade so far. I can't express how powerful it is. Every song is killer. If this was a final goodbye, my god, it leaves a lump in the throat. He was the Man in Black++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
B00005UKE0|5.0|After The Beatles broke-up as a band and went their separate ways, George Harrison was the first of &quot;The Fab Four&quot; to release his solo work. And what a release it was: a three record boxed set of some of the best music to emerge from a Beatle (if even a former Beatle - but &quot;once a Beatle- always a Beatle).<BR>In 1970 the title of the Album of songs and the Song itself, &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; seemed like a lofty philosophical expression about life and its passing experiences. Today, the album and song take on an entirely new and more realistic depth of meaning with the passing of George Harrison into eternity.<BR>It reminds us all of our own passing temporality. Indeed, all things must pass.<BR>But some things remain with us forever . . .George's songs and his performances captured on recordings like this album for instance. <BR>No one who has ever heard &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; will ever forget it. And you can't seem to ever really get the lyric mantra and melody out of your mind and heart. You wouldn't even want to forget it. It's a song for a lifetime. <BR>His cover of Bob Dylan's &quot;If Not For You&quot; is perfect and right-on. And &quot;Behind That Locked Door&quot; is the perfect country song.<BR>One of my personal favorites is Harrison's &quot;What Is Life?&quot; -- the instrumentation and arrangement are unforgettable with the &quot;fuzz&quot; sound on the lead guitar. <BR>George has left this world but he hasn't left us. He left us his music and his voice on recordings like this one. So, while all things must pass, some things and some people do remain with us. I'm glad George Harrison passed through this world and left us a little bit of himself to accompany us on our travel and our pass through this world. Thanks George!
B000087DRK|5.0|gimme deathpunk baby, and i like it.<br />i couldn't have said it better myself. ever since my older sister turned me on to turbonegro, i have been saving up to buy every turbo-related thing possible. cds, rare vynil, merchandise, movies, everything. but the question is, what is so awesome about turbonegro that makes them the greatest band ever created? the answer: what doesn't? from euroboy's incredible guitar solos to hank's chanting voice, turbonegro is one of the greatest bands of our time. every song is a classic, hard-hitting anthem that keeps you wanting more. plus, all of their albums are like nothing you've ever heard before. brand new, completely original rock for your listening pleasure. sure, some say that turbonegro is obsessed with sailors, denim, and homosexuality, but it's a lot better than your typical punk band complaining for 3 straight albums about politics and government. in short, this cd is turbo's best album yet (in mine and most people's opinions), and a must-have for a fan of any type of rock.
0316666343|2.0|After reading Alice Sebold's memoir, Lucky, I rushed out to pick up her first novel.  I had read how she had started writing this book and was forced to stop and write Lucky first so she could move past her own experiences with rape and focus on Susie Salmon.<br />I was disappointed.  Sebold's style in Lucky is raw and real but her style in Lovely Bones seems contrived and capricious.  Although I connected well with Susie, the other characters in the story were flat and uninteresting.  I would highly recommend Lucky as an alternative Sebold pick for all those who felt let down by this bestseller (and for those who loved it!).  It is an incredible account of a serious crime with lots of dark humor but minus the murder and syrupy sweetness of Lovely Bones.
B000066NW0|1.0|The only reason I'm reviewing this is because my cousin's a big fan of Avirl Lavinge.DO NOT I repeat DO NOT buy this! This CD is just another pathetic pop rock band with no musical talent what so ever! If you want to listen to real bands with good musical talent I suggest Rancid and The Drop Kick Murphies.
B0000029AP|4.0|To enjoys 70's and 80'S Aerosmith you must cleanse your mind of all preconceived notions of what this once mighty band has now become. <br />Yeah I know that's probably easier said than done. Especially coming from me as a Native Bostonian. I used to idolize these guys, I had the poster on the wall, and wore my headband and used to prance around the room pretending I was Steven Tyler. <br />There were other Ballsy, Thuggish bands in the 70's but none of them were doing Blues Rock the way Aerosmith were. <br />The cover Art is nice. Probably the best the band put out up to that point. The illustration of toys coming to life makes your imagination \\"Jog\\" so to speak, I love the Froggy Doll, being assisted by the Elephant figurine, and up top you got the Teddy Bear keeping watch, possibly guarding the locked treasure chest from the Baby orchestrating a plan via passing the keys up. <br />I'm reviewing my Vinyl LP Copy of \\"Toys in the Attic\\". Back then there weren't CD'S and Pull-Out liner notes so I can't say how good those would look, on the back of my LP Jacket theres neccesary Track Listing and who played what, plus a Good Photo of the band posing in the attack. <br />The opening title track is a mean and fast-paced rocker. The Chorus has a nice echoing effect. <br />\\"Uncle Salty\\" has always been my least favorite track on the album, though to my benefit it's right near the beginning to see the glass half full. To sum it up, I always found \\"Uncle Salty to be rather boring and is not up to par with the other 8 tracks. <br />\\"Adam's Apple\\" clearly shows these guys were influenced by the Stones. Though Aerosmith one uped them on this song by incorporating a Catchy Groove into the mix. <br />Next up is the Classic Rock Staple \\"Walk this Way\\", Over a decade later it was re-recorded with the Rap Group Run DMC. At the time the prospect didn't seem revolutionary, but in hindsight many historians look back on it as a keypoint of Rap's acceptance. <br />Anyways, yeah the songhas been chopped up into more versions, including a God-Awful Super Bowl Stageshow with Britney Spears and N Sync. Again, check that notion at the door, cuz you'll be hearing the original, which tops em all ibn my book. <br />The Basic Guitar Lick is too-Funky-for-it's own-good. Steven Tylers verses cleverly rhyme. Yet strangely enough, the band initially had trouble writing appropriate Lyrics for it way back when, until Steven Tyler caught a Late Showing of The Mel Brooks' Film \\"Young Frankenstein\\", a character, the Lazy Eyed HunchBack played by Marty Feldman, chanted the words \\"Walk this way, Walk this way\\". The band had finally found a proper title for the song and the rest, as they say, is Rock N' Roll history. <br />Aerosmith always had a knack for cover tunes and \\"Big Ten Inch Record\\" is no exception. Written by J. Weismantel, the lyrics are humorous fare, with the line \\"I whipped out my Big Ten Inch...Record\\". I live in Boston and I never hear this song played on the Classic Rock Stations, but it somehow wound up on the bands most recent Greatest Hits Compilation. Surely there more well known cuts that shouldve got consideration, but then again this band has released quitE a few compilations and live albums, but none of which truly capture their essence IMO. <br />\\"Sweet Emotion\\" still gets plenty of Airtime on Classic Rock Radio, and not without merit. The Full 4:30 + version you'll hear on \\"Toys in the Attic\\" is superior to the edited one (The running length is cut in half) Available on \\"Aerosmith's Greatest Hits\\". The opening Tom Hamilton Bass Line recalls elemEnts of Eastern Mysticism, A Talk Box shows up right before the chorus, followed by a Two Guitar Corroboration by Joe Perry and Brad Whitford. What's unique is there is no Solo, but this track doesn't need one, it would sound out of place. The Song's best moment is in the final two minutes, Joey Kramer gives the snare a good pounding, And the Guitars combine with the Talk Box to carry it away. <br />Warming up in the Bullpen is one of Aerosmith's overlooked songs, \\"No More No More\\". A winding Guitar Lick gets the ball rolling, and Steven Tyler combines with the past and his bands present day in two lines: \\"Blood stains the ivories on my daddy's baby grand/I ain't seen no daylight since we started this band.\\". Plus the hook is easy to remember cuz it's simply the words \\"No more, No more. <BR>No more, No more\\". And the refrain goes \\"Baby I'm a Dreamer, Found my horse and carriage\\". The overall mood is very sentimental minus the sappy element that would plague their post-1992 Music. A high-note keyboard can also be heard, which in my opinion improves things. <br />There's only one more \\"Rocking\\" track on the album, \\"Round And Round\\" and what a finale it is. Not to be confused with the Megahit by Ratt of the same name, (which for the record is also stellar). <br />The Atmosphere intensifies with each minute. Steven Tyler sings with a Brash Attitude and the Guitars re-inforce him. <BR>The ending verse \\"climbs\\" alongside a whiny keyboard. Great Stuff. <br />Sensibly, the Boys chose to finish off the album with a ballad. \\"You See me Crying\\" is Good, but not excellent like their follow-up album \\"Rocks\\" ballad, \\"Home Tonight\\". <BR>My Gripe with \\"You See me Crying\\" is that it runs a minute too long, whereas \\"Home Tonight' is short, sweet, and to the point. <br />Regardless, the lyrics to \\"You See Me Crying\\" are extremely heartfelt: \\"You see me Crying, but don't let that get you down\\". As it builds up an Orchestra is present, I'm not sure if it's genuine, or just keyboards but either way I like it. Steven Tyler performs with a Scream style singing that is absent on the Bans 1980's Recordings, could that be due to age/Drugs (Both?) I dunno. <br />Their fall from Grace has been very painful for me to watch. Last Week My Aunt told me the reviews for their NFL Kickoff concert at the National Mall in Washington, D.C. <BR>Well if you can stomach (Gulp) the mere thought of thisband who recorded songs like \\"Sweet Emotion\\" and \\"Walk this way\\" sharing the stage with Pre-Fab Teen Pop acts, yeah I guess their concert wouldn't be half bad.<br />If you're a beginner to Aerosmith, pick up the follow up album to this one first, it's called \\"Rocks\\". Listen to that, and then return to this one.

0792841344|4.0|I saw the first Phantasm back in 1979.  I was a little 6th grader with no clue what I was getting into.  Back then the shows didn't check for I.D's. The movie freaked me out so that, that Saturday I was to have a sleep over at my girl friends.  I ended up going home instead and ended up sleeping in my parents bedroom for two nights.  And, anyway what where my P's thinking letting a 6th grader go to a horror movie.  They just left me money and I went to see what ever I wanted.  Maybe that is why at 36 nothing scares me anymore.  I do own Phantasm 1.  but not the others.  Was not thrilled about the sequels, sorry.  I still watch it every fall with friends from that era. We always have a good time, and I still get creped out.<BR>Great job on the original movie.<BR>Most Sincerely,<BR>Ms. Rebecca M. Pfarr
B00006AG5N|5.0|The one and only King of Rock and Roll is at his best on thsi CD. It has a great choice of songs and are remastered to a new level of clarity. Great jobs guys!

B0000BYM3K|4.0|At first this album struck me as just alright for Maiden, with the typical harmonies and guitar solos, but the more I listened the more I liked. A few songs are somewhat drawn out and almost repetitive, but the title track is simply amazing taking a very progressive sound to almost make you think you were listening to Strativarius or the great Dream Theater. Overall its a solid metal album, which in this day and age is getting hard to find.
B00005O5JV|4.0|I am a 35-year-old teacher and I loved this movie! It was light, fluffy and wholesome! It is enjoyable and worth the money! Enjoy! I have watched it at least 100 times.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|For those of you who thought the album cover is disappointing - I agree. It was an interesting idea, but the CG image just did not deliver. However, nonetheless, you all need to get over it. I did not buy the cd for the cover.<br />  Aside from Maiden's insistence on maintaining their 6-7-1 formula, this is a great album. I cannot say whether it is as good as Brave New World or not, because it is surprisingly different in subtle ways. It does have a deja vu feel to it I will admit, but after releasing as many songs as they have, I am not surprised they are repeating themselves some.<br />  What surprised me is that there opening song, \\"Wildest Dreams,\\" is in major, and this not something I would expect from them, not to mention that they haven't used a major scale in quite a while. The album starts out quick and light, and delves deeper into their more epic sound as the album progresses, and stays there until \\"Journeyman,\\" the last song, which has virtually no distorted guitar at all.<br />  Again with the trivial complaints: So the cover falls short - get over it; So they have softened a LITTLE - get over it; Blaze Bailey ... - no, he sang fine, his voice just didn't fit Maiden's sound; they're not what they used to be, blah blah blah. Folks, times change, people change - it comes with getting older. And I can't think of any reason why a band would want to stay exactly the same after 20 years.<br />  Like I said, Dance of Death is a great album. It will please their fans, but it may not make too many new ones. I, for one, hope they continue to make albums long after they're all dead...<br /> ...Hey, their age is starting to show, but as long as they can play & sing, I couldn't care less. I am 20 years old and have been a fan since I was about 4; boys, I expect to see a new album released on my 100th birthday.
B00006SFBD|5.0|Granted, My Arms Your Hearse (my personal fav.) and Still Life are tough acts to follow, but Blackwater Park was a bit disappointing to me.  It (and Damnation, incidently) sounded like Mikael quickly wrote all the vocals a couple days before going into the studio-- which he did.  Deliverance still does not have the content or depth of material of MAYH and SL (particularly with vocal and guitar harmonies), but it has some new sounds and some truly insane moments (see &quot;By the Pain I See in Others&quot;).  Utter mayhem from true artistic development deserves five stars even if it doesn't surpass their past accomplishments.  Besides, what possibly could?
B000001F3C|5.0|When one first inserts this disc into their CD player, one thinks of &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;, &quot;October&quot;, and &quot;Boy&quot;. But it soon becomes apparent that &quot;War&quot; is a much more solid album than the three just listed. <br />This album marks the end of U2s early, angry period, while also marking the beginning of their cohesive song writing ability that has made them the rock legends they are today.<br />The first track is a U2 classic. &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;, an angry song about the every day struggles in Ireland, is a great opener. It catches the listener's attention and keeps them from going astray when the second track, &quot;Seconds&quot;, starts playing. Though it is less lively, and not as well put together musically, the lyrics are still on par with the first track.<br />&quot;New Year's Day&quot; sounds like something that could have been on &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;, if the production was a little better.<br />The nest stand out track is &quot;The Refugee&quot;. A very primal song, with the drums and voices more prominent than the soft bass beat in the background and occasional guitar riff. While simple, this song is probably my favorite on the album. Listen to it, notice how flexible Bono's voice is.<br />&quot;Two Hearts Beat as One&quot; is a faster song that isn't angry at all. A simple love song.<br />&quot;Surrender&quot; reminds me of &quot;Angel of Harlem&quot;, and is really a good song. It does not run on too long like some other reviewers have said.<br />The very last track, &quot;40&quot;, is a slow finisher. The effect works very well, though. Instead of a bombastic finish or grand finale that a lot of albums like to have in the very end, this one kind of just fades out.<br />Overall, out of all of U2s albums, I rate this one at a very close #2, trailing &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;. Buy it even if you only remotely like U2.
B0000A02TZ|4.0|All I can say is that this is a GREAT movie and I do not understand the complaints about the previews....Altho it is true that you cannot use the menu key to bypass them(hence the 4 stars), you can however use the FF button like we do and it takes 2 seconds to do....I think that the people complaining about this forgot what it was like to have VHS's where you had no choice but to FF thru them or watch.....Have we become so spoiled with technology that to take a little extra time out of our lives causes us to return a great flick....If so, I feel bad for you all
B00005PJ8O|5.0|It's hard to decide whether Patton was more feared by the enemy or by the very men who served under him.  His attitude was gruff, his outlook bloody, and his thirst for conflict insatiable.  But with this film, viewers get to see exactly why this opinionated, sometimes unethical General was possibly the greatest leader on the battlefield in the European Theatre of World War II - and George C. Scott portrays Patton in a most memorable manner.<br />Without a doubt, Patton's exploits on the battlefield won great victories for the Allies.  This is, of course, not to take away from powerful leaders on both sides, such as Patton's comrade-yet-rival Field Marshal Sir Bernard Law Montgomery, but Patton will always be remembered by the United States Army not only for his glories, but also for the controversy he managed to stir up.  This film showcases both sides of the man.  His respect for the uniform and his undeniable loyalty to the United States of America made him the hero, but his quest to &quot;beat Montgomery to Messina&quot; and the incident in which he slapped an enlisted man and called him a coward do much to antagonize him in the eyes of many.  That's one of the greatest things about this film:  the filmmakers have made it so that it does not concentrate wholly on Patton's good side nor his bad side, but instead, create an atmosphere in which the viewer's opinion of the man constantly changes.<br />Packed with intense battle scenes, dialogue that is often nearly as intense, and some somber moments, &quot;Patton&quot; is a film that will have your attention for the entirety of its nearly three-hour running length.  If you're the special-effects lover, then this film is probably not for you, but understand that it was made before the advent of computer-aided and, in my opinion, useless and corny graphic effects.  This is just pure cinematic mastery, depicting a great leader and a passionate, even if flawed, fighting man.
B000093OU8|4.0|The first time I heard this album I was a little disappointed as I was expecting something along the lines of &quot;Run for cover&quot;. However over the years this album has grown on me and I think it is actually one of Mr. Moore's best. There are so many influences present but none more so then his irish heritage which is blended with his stylish guitar playing and music writing from the powerful &quot;Over the hills&quot; to the beautiful but sad &quot;Johnny Boy&quot;. <br />He is a gifted musician and songwriter and this album illustrates why.

1583762027|5.0|Great title, great information, great book.<br />I was one of the worst procrastinators on the planet until I got this book.  A set of stairs outside my home that needed fixing actually got to the point that they were dangerous before I went out, ripped them off and replaced them.  Why?  I feared the frog that lived there.  I was convinced that the project would take a full day (at least) and would probably need a professional carpenter before I was through.  I read this book and decided that the stairs were my first frog.  That sucker slid down my throat in an hour and a half and the stairs are strong and attractive.<br />In case you haven't gotten the analogy yet (or read about the book in the editorial review), the frog of the title represents the biggest, worst, most dreaded task on your plate for any given day.  If you put it off and put it off it's possible to worry about the the job longer than it will take to finish it.  Even worse, the frog may grow because you've let it go for so long and then swallowing the damnable amphibian becomes nigh impossible.<br />There are loads of other great information on how to determine what your particular frog may be, the best way to approach it and other time management techniques included as well, but the title really says it all.  After the frog goes down the hatch the rest of the day is yours.  Open wide and say ribbit!

B000028U0Y|5.0|Johnny Cash was a legendary figure of American music who often seemed the embodiment of an prophet from the Old Testament (and not one of the happier ones at that).  With his passing there is a natural impulse to want to listen to the man and his music, but we really should resist the impulse to take the easy way out and listen to one of the greatest hits collections of The Man in Black (after all, the first Johnny Cash hits album came out forty years ago).  Instead you track done one of the superb albums that he put out during his music career.  From that perspective &quot;At Folsom Prison&quot; and &quot;At San Quentin&quot; are the two quintessential Johnny Cash albums from what ended up being the &quot;early&quot; part of one of the great careers in American music.  Both albums were recorded live in front of eager audiences of prison inmates in the late 1960s and provide ample proof of why Cash was one of the most imposing and influential figures in country music.<br />Part of the reason this is a great album is because Cash clearly plays to his audience, singing songs about prison, crime and murder, loss and regret, mother and God, and most importantly loneliness.  There is no sugarcoating of the harsh realities of prison life in these songs as Cash sings the songs of the gospel of darkness and rage.  Cash's singing is truly authentic (you can feel him feeding off of his audience) and the result is compelling cathartic.  This is not an album filled with hits although there are certainly several recognizable songs: &quot;Folsom Prison Blues,&quot; &quot;Jackson,&quot; and &quot;I Still Miss Someone.&quot;  But it will be the ones you might never have heard before, such as &quot;I Got Stripes,&quot; that stand out in your mind after listening to the album.  This was already a 5 star album, but this 1999 reissue CD now provides the entire concert, adding three previously unreleased tracks: &quot;Busted,&quot; &quot;Joe Bean,&quot; and &quot;The Legend of John Henry's Hammer.&quot;  &quot;At Folsom Prison&quot; is an essential Johnny Cash album and if you own just two Johnny Cash CDs I would pick this one and 1994's &quot;American Recording.&quot;  They will surely give you the measure of the Man in Black and his music.y's Hammer.&quot;  &quot;At Folsom Prison&quot; is an essential Johnny Cash album and if you own just two Johnny Cash CDs I would pick this one and 1994's &quot;American Recording.&quot;  They will surely give you the measure of the Man in Black and his music.
6305922756|5.0|Documentary filmmaker Marty DiBergi (Rob Reiner) chronicles the final US tour of the unappreciated heavy metal band Spinal Tap (Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer).  This hilarious parody of the rock scene was so good that it spawned an entire sub-genre of mock documentaries (although now I seem to recall Eric Idle in a film about a fictional group &quot;of no fixed hairstyle&quot; called the Rutles back in the 70s).  Fans of 70s and 80s metal will catch many references that will slip by others.  The real miracle of this film is that it skewers its target so mercilessly, and yet avoids becoming cruel.  The enthusiasm of the Tap members for being rock stars is so pure and joyful, even after many years and despite the reality of their crumbling tour, that we can't help but wish them well.
0321127420|3.0|This is a well written book, with resonable explanations and samples. If you are familiar with patterns by GOF and distrubuted architecture patterns then there is not much new in this book. If not this is a must read and serves as a basis for platform independant review of a good cross section patterns to be applied in enterprise architecture, in which RDBMS's are always a key component. My expectations were high based on Mr Fowlers earlier works, not to say this is a lesser work, just it has been well covered before this work by Mr Fowler.
B000002U82|5.0|This was the first Pink Floyd album I ever owned. I remember at that time the only Floyd songs I knew were &quot;Money&quot; and &quot;Another Brick in the Wall Pt.2&quot;. Anyway about the album, every song is good some better than others. I love the sax on Money and &quot;Us and Them&quot;.&quot;On the Run&quot; has some cool synthesizer effects and  &quot;Any colour you like&quot; is a great instrumental. If you listen to the very beginning of &quot;Speak to me/Breathe&quot; and the very and of &quot;Eclipse&quot; you see that the album is a continuous cycle. Great Gig in the Sky is my least favorite. The guitar solo on time is one of David Gilmour's best and once again you have the harmonizing of Dave and Rick Wright like in Echoes. Those drums i think they're called tom-toms that Nick Mason plays in time sound awsome and great songwriting by Roger. Brain Damage is good too. I recommend this album to anyone who doesn't have music by Pink Floyd and would like to be introduced to their music. I know that compilations with the hits are usually good introductions to someone's catalog but in the case of PF your better off buying their individual albums. PF does have some compilations out there and i have a few but none of them are really worth it or at least they won't make good first album.

B0000BYM3K|5.0|I have been loving Iron Maiden and I consider their first 5 studio albums within the most influencing Metal world's ever, plus their absolutely awesome Live After Death as maybe the best live rock experience.<BR>Later, with the left of their lead guitar Smith and frontman Bruce, I was able to listen only one or two songs per album, really not understanding how a such awesome band could ever fall in ths way.<BR>I began to smile again 3 years ago with &quot;Brave New World&quot; and their good live &quot;Rock in Rio&quot; (containing the best version of &quot;Hallowed be thy name&quot; ever !) and today...<br />Dance of Death appared in my favourite music store !<br />What can I say ? They're back, more powerful than ever, obviously learning on what they have done in these years !<BR>They have abandoned almost completely the slower intros which have weakened &quot;BNW&quot;, and the resulting energy in certain tracks it's awesome.<br />First track, the single, it's quite below Maiden standards, but the real album starts with the second one &quot;Rainmaker&quot; : among the best Maiden songs ever recorded, believe me, you will be singing this one for days !<BR>&quot;No more lies&quot; and &quot;Montsegur&quot; are really powerful tracks, like no one was on &quot;BNW&quot;. <BR>The title track &quot;Dance of death&quot; it's the classic Harris' great epic (I can't stop listening to it), the following two &quot;Gates of tomorrow&quot; and &quot;New frontier&quot; have good guitars and chorus.<BR>&quot;Paschendale&quot; it's another great epic and a very good song in the same vein as &quot;The trooper&quot;.<BR>Then there are &quot;Face in the sand&quot; and &quot;Age of innocence&quot;, showing you their intention to allow you breathing only rarely !<BR>The last track &quot;Journeyman&quot; it's quite melodic and contains a splendid chrous.<br />I am really amazed, all the tracks but the first one (I can't explain why they made it the single) have their power, their great moments and you will never desire to skip one of them.<br />Buy it, you will not regret !<br />UP THE IRONS !!!
B00006LIRI|2.0|Much like the 1980-1990 retrospective, this collection suffers from a terrible selection of music.  Key singles are missing while others are illogically offered in new mixes.

B0000BYM3K|5.0|I have just listened to it four times and now I like enough to give it 4.5 stars.  In my first and second listenings I would have given it just 3, but it was not fair because it was in the office, with low volume and cheap PC speakers.  I still think that Brave New World is better, and that Powerslave and Somewhere in Time are the best, followed by Seventh Son.  The thing that I dont like about Maiden lately is that they are using too much the celtic sound and repetition.  Anyway, this is much better than Fear Of the Dark, No Prayer for the Dying, The X Factor, and Virtual XI.  My order of favorite albums would be:<br />1. Powerslave/ Somewhere in Time<br />2. Seventh Son / Number of the Beast/ Brave New World<br />3. Iron Maiden / Piece of Mind/ Dance of Death<br />4. Killers<br />5. Fear of The Dark<br />6. No Prayer<br />7. The X Factor<br />8. Virtual XI
B00005UWBP|5.0|While many people like to chide that &quot;the book is always better than the movie&quot;, the case here is quite the opposite. While the book's beginning was illogical (raptors swimming from Isla Nublar/Isla Sorna and terrorizing people on the coast? :p ), the movie's isn't. The characters are more likable (especially Hammond, Dr. Wu, and Lex), and there are less repetitious action sequences (while the book was crazy for the T-Rex and had him antagonize Grant and the kids over and over again, in the movie his screen time is cut so we don't get tired of him). <br />As for the movie itself, it looks damn good. True, there might be a few bloopers and flubs here and there, but the CGI is very convincing considering the time the movie was made and released. I also liked the characters, especially Malcolm and Muldoon. <br />If you liked the book, then unless you stick to the &quot;book &gt; movie&quot; cliche chanted by so many a bookworm, you will love the movie.
B000094DUP|5.0|i bought this cd because i absolutly loved born to try and on first listening wasn't wholly impressed but after listeneing to it many more times i must admit - i was wrong. this is one of the best albums of the year with songs such as innocent eyes and a year ago today. she is an amazing talent who writes her own songs and plays the piano on them - definitly deserves the success she is bound to get.
B00005JLYW|4.0|I have to say ,if you start out watching this expecting citizen kane then you are going to be very disapointed. But if you want a fun silly movie that has hot girls being over the top [tush] kicking crime fighters... then this is the flick for you! <BR> <BR>The plot is simple,the songs are catchy and Its wonderful eye candy. Crispin glovers role alone makes the whole thing worth watching. There are cameos galore and if you can ignore demi moore's presence (which isnt hard she is barely in it) then you should be pleasantly surprised at how entertaining this movie is.
6305428220|4.0|well i wont say i watched this JUST for josh hartnett - wel actually i did but i was so impressed by this film it is a very cliched plot and the ending - who ends up with who is very predictable BUT you could relate to the characters and they all had their own needs and this was reflected in the film - particularly impressed with clea duVall she was good.
B00000JR2A|5.0|I do like the Big Chair album but that album is nothing in comparison to their 1989 outing. The music is completely different from any of their previous material and has a far more Beatles influenced color to it and a more soulful sound to it.<br />The best song on this album is the rocking &quot;Year Of The Knife&quot; and the bittersweet &quot;Advice For The Young At Heart&quot; which brought me to tears and makes me yearn for 1989 to return, if just for one day!<br />It's sad that the group split after eventually disbanded for many years this album but word has it that they've reunited and things are looking up again!<br />Buy this album and get the remastered edition.
0385504209|4.0|This was a fun, quick and easy book to read.  The mystery story line was captivating and enjoyable.  The recognizable settings (Paris, London) and references (Da Vinci, the Bible, the Holy Grail) draw the reader into the plot.  However, that easy familiarity might lead one to conclude that the author's assertions about religion, art, history, and literature are both true and accurate.  To the contrary, they are not, but are based largely on spurious documents and academically discredited writings.  So, enjoy the story, but remember this is fiction, despite the pre-Prologue's blanket claim of &quot;fact&quot; and accuracy.  Avoid embarrassing yourself by taking the author's &quot;research&quot; at face value!
0753503921|5.0|This is a sensational book.  Most autobiographies are boring and so full of only positive stuff about the person that you just know you are not getting the full picture.  In this book Branson openly admits mistakes and bad business decisions.  He gives credit to others acknowledging Virgin's success would not have happened without them.  He also included instances when he has been brought back down to earth for example when two tourists asked for a picture he thought that he was being nice and started posing for them until he saw their confused faces and realised they wanted him to take a picture of them.<br />This book tells the reader everything about the Virgin empire from the first issue of Student magazine in 1968 to approval for their trains thirty years later in 1998.  Obviously a lot more has happened since 98 such as Virginblue in Australia but we will have to wait for the sequel for that.  This is a brilliant book which is as enjoyable as the great financial fictional thrillers like Harry Bingham's the Money Makers and Maxx Barry's Syrup.  This is so mush more inspiring when you realise Branson is not a fictional character and these achievements are real.  This book will inspire you to get out there and make money. Buy it!
B0000BYM3K|3.0|I love Iron Maiden but my god, please Steve Harris, break away from your typical intros and song progressions for once.  It amazes me that Steve wrote songs like Phantom Of the Opera, Hallowed Be Thy Name, Aces High and Alexander The Great, among others...and for the past three years the songs he writes seem to have the same exact formula.  The problem with these songs is the riffs are not very memorable, the sound is stuck in the mid-range and the clean guitar harmonies sound alike.  Listen to Paschendale during the guitar solos...those are awesome guitar solos but they seem to completely outclass the rest of the song's guitar work and riffs.  Track 9, Face In The Sand, starts out sounding like classic Iron Maiden with the tone, tempo changes, and multi-layered guitar parts...I thought to myself this was going to be awesome...then the main part of the song kicks in and it's just drowned out by the overwhelming double bass drums (when has Nicko used a double bass before??)...this song is still, in my oppinion, one of the best<BR>songs on the album and better than most songs of BNW. <br />The best parts of this album are some totally original and great guitar solos...not alot, but more than anyone else is putting out. The sound doesn't sound as hollow as BNW.  <br />The cons of this album are that there are too many simlitarities in the songs with that of BNW.  Steve Harris' <BR>songwriting seems to be stuck in the mud.  Janick Gers is still<BR>in the band, pumping out the same, messy, disorganized guitar<BR>solos that don't seem to add anything to the band...get rid of<BR>him Steve.  The sound could be better...sounds too full at times, there's not that razor edge to the sound...new producer maybe??
B000089RVX|2.0|Cookie cutter modern rock. I wouldv'e gave it One Star but I watched the video for this cd and Amy Lee has nice thighs/legs. <br />Anyone who buys this Cd might as well buy 50 Cent's Get Rich Or Die Trying. It's that bad.
0385512104|5.0|Haddon does a wonderful job of maintaining a unique narrative voice and allowing us to feel compassion for characters who do some not very lovable things. If you enjoy audio books, this is a great one to listen to. The novel is set in England, and the reader and author together do an excellent job of taking us inside the head of a 15 year old British autistic savant. Funny at times, almost unbearably sad at others, and thoroughly enjoyable.
B00006F83Y|3.0|At first I was a little hesitant to type up a review because this is the first rock CD I actually have ever listened to and like. After reading some of the bad reviews I left it at 3 stars to even things out. Now I don't anything about the Rock World and how you guys judge music or what not but I enjoyed two songs that were made by these guys. They were the songs &quot;Go With The Flow&quot; and the song that has the deers in the video. Now you have to understand that I listen to nothing but Rap &amp; R&amp;B. I always have.
B00009W0U4|3.0|aspects of this film are brilliant - the way sound and camera work to produce a churning sense of disorientation really affected me, and i guess that's the point in a world where we can imagine there is little we have not seen.  there were parts of this film i could not watch, and the commentary in these reviews about the ability to &quot;handle&quot; the violence is pretty childish - or reflects the same impulse of sadistic machismo that drives the film.  my sense was that this was an intensely personal portrait of rage, and it took me places i really did not want to go. the film uses a range of techniques to encode realism, which is not to say that the film is any more real than what hollywood produces.  to cite the rape in the film as &quot;realistic&quot; is beside the point - it is graphic and horrifying, which rape is, but within a mediaculture which increasingly eroticises rape it would be a mistake to imagine that this film provides the &quot;authentic&quot; version (and thus some rapes really are erotic). this is a haunting and unpalatable film, and it saddens me that some viewers think their ability to consume this imagery is noble or clever.
B00005YUTD|5.0|When our son was a baby he had many health problems.  These problems, and the medications used to treat them, caused him to be very irritable.  I bought this video on a whim and when I put it in the VCR an amazing thing happened...he calmed right down.  After that, all we ever had to do when he was uncomfortable was to pop in this video.<br />Today, he is almost two and much healthier, thank God.  He still enjoys the video, although he no longer needs it for calming.  He loves to \\"sing\\" along with the music.  He also seems to be more musically inclined than my older son who had no such exposure in infancy.
B000099T2L|3.0|Beyonce smashed into radio ariwaves this summer with the explosive smash &quot;Crazy In Love&quot; featuring her &quot;are-they-or-aren't-they?&quot; partner, Jay-Z. Shrewdly powered by a Chi-Lites horn sample, the song was one of the most recognizable on the radio. The song shot up Billboard as if it were on fire, so it was no surprise her CD entered at #1. For the most part, &quot;Danerously In Love&quot; is a deserved hit. In the beginning, it's like some kind of drug: Beyonce's instinct for penning and producing hit-worthy, danceable music stems from her Destiny's Child days is just like crack.<br />The beginning of &quot;Dangerously In Love&quot; launches out of your speakers like fireworks, threatening to destroy them. Right after the bravado of &quot;Crazy In Love,&quot; Beyonce doesn't let the listener have a breather with the slinky follow up, &quot;Naughty Girl&quot; (which samples Donna Summer's &quot;Love to Love You Baby&quot;). Beyonce succeeds again with the shockingly retro-yet-oh-so-catchy arrangement. Next is the dynamite beat of &quot;Baby Boy,&quot; pairing her with the ubiquitous Sean Paul. The song is even more recognizable than &quot;Crazy In Love&quot; with its deeply funky Arabic beat and irrestible hook. Sean Paul and Beyonce's chemistry is instantly evident. The always inventive Outkast is up next in &quot;Hip-Hop Star.&quot; Beyonce's breathy delivery coupled with the ridiculously edgy beat are simple ecstasy, and Big Boi's cameo fleshes out an already fleshed-out track.<br />After this quartet of definite hits, though, the CD instantly takes a downturn. After the nice but unspectacular &quot;Be With You,&quot;<BR>the CD falls into the abyss. Taking down the tempo more than just a few notches, &quot;Dangerously In Love&quot; becomes plagued with ballad fever. The Missy Elliot-produced &quot;Signs&quot; is an abomination, something very sub-par from the creator of such hits as &quot;So Gone&quot; and &quot;My Love Is Like...Wo!&quot; Although some relief comes along in the end (in the form of the lush &quot;Dangerously In Love 2&quot; and the sparkling &quot;The Closer I Get To You&quot; with Luther Vandross), the album's mood becomes dirtied.<br />&quot;Dangergously In Love&quot; is peppered with potential hits, generally in the first half, but the choice to slow down the tempo of the overall album damaged its flow. Overall, Beyonce's album is definitely above average. Don't believe what the first four tracks put across: the album does take a dive. Maybe next time.
B0000931QA|5.0|To truly recognize the magnitude of Operation:Mindcrime, you must examine the state of popular music at the time this record was released.  This reminds me of Permanent Waves by Rush, which entirely blew everything else around it out of the water.<BR>How can you equate &quot;Don't Worry be Happy&quot; (Bobby McFerrin) or &quot;Sweet Child O' Mine&quot; (Guns and Roses) with the chorus of Suite Sister Mary?<BR>Forget Nirvana or Alice in Chains; Queensryche is the band that started the Seattle music revolution.  Take this from someone who is diametrically opposed to just about any political leaning of this band:  The undeniable truth is that Queensryche delivered message, theme, and complexity before it was cool.<BR>Given the climate of today's music, we will probably never see its equal.<BR>With Pink Floyd's The Wall and Rush's Permanent Waves, Operation:Mindcrime completes the holy trinity of 70's- 80's studio achievements.<BR>If you pride yourself as being one who appreciates good music regardless of its airtime or popularity, Operation:Mindcrime is a test.  Give it a listen, and you'll ask yourself as I do, where are efforts like this today?<BR>Sadly, they aren't there.  VH-1 is too busy praising bands like Metallica for the Black Album.
B00006L83N|5.0|Symphony X means the perfect combination of progression, power, melody, symphony, technicality and emotion all in one...To me this album is a breakthrough in the world of progressive metal. The band's amazing musicianship being very technical, high standard in song writting, very touching and HEAVY...Very special song in this album...&quot;Accolade II&quot;, this song makes me cry!!! Some fans didn't really find it as amazing as &quot;Accolade&quot; in DWOT album, but I guess for a song like that played in the original song's harmony, it's so amazing that it turned out like that...I would give this album a 5 because it's simply Symphony X! Allen's voice is so powerful on &quot;Inferno&quot; and &quot;King Of Terrors&quot;. Romeo gave out all his best into this album, keyboards work was perfect, very clear bass lines and of course amazing drums stating that it's heavier than ever...In my own opinion no other prog band has got the spirit of this band, I mean the tunes, the music and the melody...This is the progressive metal band that I can simply say that it's PERFECT! I won't mension names of the bands in mind :) but I only want to say to all new listeners of Symphony X this is a good album to start with...But still my fav. of all time...&quot;The Divine Wings Of Tragedy&quot; album.<br />Regards from the biggest Symphony X fan in my region :)<BR>Rami
B000001ESN|5.0|I bought this record because, like you,  I liked Spirit of Radio  and Freewill.  Unlike most, I came to recognize that Natural Science and Jacob's Ladder were incredible achievements in rock history.  Just try to re-create the drum part in alternating 6/8 7/8 time in Jacob's Ladder while the guitar ostenato unmercifully carries on.  If your brain doesn't melt, you're halfway there. <BR>It is dificult, if not impossible, to overrate the musical prowess of Geddy lee, Neil Peart, and Alex Lifeson.  Each a virtuoso at his craft, they created 23 years ago what no popular artist could hope to produce today: a thoughtful, forward-looking project that stretches the boundaries of individual performance as well as intellectual thinking.<BR>It's just a shame that Neil Peart thinks mankind is the problem, rather than the solution.  But what else would you expect from a Canadian?
B00006LLNU|5.0|Sigur Rós was an unknown group with a strange name when I first heard of them while reading a concert listing.  The name stuck with me, and one night I recalled the name and first heard \\"Vaka\\" (aka \\"Untitled 1\\") off \\"()\\".  Since then, the Icelandic quartet has become one of my top bands.<br />The band has an unmatched skill at absolutely swallowing the listener whole into a sea of music that encompasses everything.  Quite frankly, they are the masters of atmospheric music, and \\"()\\" is their best work yet.  A CD without track titles, coherent lyrics, or any liner notes, \\"()\\" is a true oddity in the modern realm of music.<br />Though many find the band to reek of pretentiousness by being so avant-garde that the lyrics are not sung in Icelandic, but rather a fictional language called \\"Hopelandic,\\" Sigur Ros is too good to be pretentious.  The vocals are amazing enough when sung that, as many have said, the fictional lyrics just become another instrument, one equal with the piano and guitar that are staples of Sigur Ros's sound.<br />Although Sigur Ros's sound on \\"()\\" is very simplistic and repeats the melody over and over, the melodies are so gorgeous and  perfectly-arranged that it is impossible to avoid liking the songs.<br />Sigur Ros is one of the best bands out there right now.  \\"()\\" as an album completes their ambition as musicians, to prove that music can even in its stripped-down and pure, simple form, be as incredible as the most complex music there is.
B000002J09|5.0|Still powerful after over 30 years on the market, this album is the first zenith of Zeppelin's career (&quot;Physical Grafitti&quot; is their best album pound for pound, literally), and a brilliant snapshot of a band at its swaggering prime. &quot;Black Dog&quot;, &quot;Rock and Roll&quot;, &quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot;, &quot;Going to California&quot;, &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot;...alright, every song, is just fantastic. A flawless album, made all that much better by the presence of rock's biggest epic &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;. Switched-on, powerful, just great.
0743442539|5.0|A word of warning: \\"The Spy who Came in From the Cold\\" is not just an espionage thriller, it's a horror story.<br />British MI-5 agent Alec Leamas, the eponymous hero of John Le Carre's brutal little espionage masterpiece \\"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold\\", discovers that being a secret agent at the height of the Cold War is a little like being a man outside in the cold, looking in on the friendly warmth of home and hearth but unable to come in---so close, yet so far. His life depends on keeping up a charade, on cloaking his intentions and lying about his work. He can trust no one but himself, and he keeps an eagle eye on himself.<br />To make matters worse, a botched defection at the Berlin Wall sends Leamas's career into free fall, prompting his recall to London, a subsequent reassignment to a desk job in Personnel, and, simultaneously, the hatching of one of British intelligence chief Control's more byzantine little schemes: use Leamas's fall from grace as a means of ferreting out and destroying Hans Dieter Mundt, a high-ranking East German master spy and Leamas's shadowy nemesis.<br />To say more would be unfair to the reader. Le Carre, himself a former British intelligence officer, is perfectly suited to composing the elaborate, excruciating fencing match between London and Moscow that lies at the heart of so many of his best tales. The typical Le Carre protagonist and his handlers are not James Bondian pulp heroes with Union Jacks painted on the pommel of their 9MM Walther PPKs; instead, they tend to be bland, non-descript ciphers, poker-faced and cynical creatures who hide their machinations under bland exteriors.<br />\\"The Spy\\" is Le Carre at his deftest, and the Cold War at its coldest. Leamas is re-introduced into the world as a potential defector, but his ruse is haunted by the unexpected relationship with a British librarian he leaves behind in London. And really, the relationship, and the emotions it awakens in this grizzled Cold Warrior, is what makes \\"Spy\\" so compulsively entertaining and riveting: Alec Leamas wants to love and to reveal himself, just as his East German interrogator Fiedler wants desperately to believe in the purity of the Revolution and in the ideals of Communism.<br />But this is a Le Carre novel, and ideals and emotions are the luxuries of the dead or the doomed.<br />\\"The Spy\\" has the advantage of excellent pacing and deft characterization, and as with many of Le Carre's best novels, it manages to condense a considerable amount of treachery in a minimum of exposition. Le Carre is not only a good storyteller and a master at plotting out the grim duel between his spies, he is also a consummately gifted writer who uses words like a surgeon uses a scalpel. Best of all, \\"The Spy\\" is a nastily clever work, in which the plot turns in on itself suddenly and viciously, casting some light on a dark arena in which no one can be trusted.<br />\\"The Spy who Came in From the Cold\\" is a classic in espionage and a timeless literary masterpiece, but it is also a ruthless and jolting work whose cynicism is horrific. It is a bracingly good read and completely unforgettable.es \\"Spy\\" so compulsively entertaining and riveting: Alec Leamas wants to love and to reveal himself, just as his East German interrogator Fiedler wants desperately to believe in the purity of the Revolution and in the ideals of Communism. <br />But this is a Le Carre novel, and ideals and emotions are the luxuries of the dead or the doomed. <br />\\"The Spy\\" has the advantage of excellent pacing and deft characterization, and as with many of Le Carre's best novels, it manages to condense a considerable amount of treachery in a minimum of exposition.

B00009V7T2|5.0|This album plays out like an hour-long nightmare: abstract, scary, roaring, eerily quiet, it contains everything but a radio friendly single. Inspired by a friend's failed suicide, his slip into a coma, awakening and successful suicide, this is hardly material for the TRL generation. It's especially ironic, seeing as how their sound manipulator Jeremy Michael Ward (laugh if you must, but this album is HIS work) died before the album's release. Be careful: if you listen to this album in a dark room late at night, close to sleep (even sober, too), you WILL freak out and your nightmares will torture you. What an album.
6305897786|5.0|Let's be clear about \\"The Ninth Gate\\": the movie is easily one of Roman Polanski's best, and certainly one of the most deliciously creepy, eerie, unsettling and deeply atmospheric films about diabolism and deviltry ever made.<br />With a script drawn from Spanish author Arturo Perez Reverte's quirky \\"Le Club Dumas\\", \\"The Ninth Gate\\" is the Faustian tale of an unscrupulous New York dealer in rare books (played with tactful understatement and curiosity by Johnny Depp) commissioned by secretive tycoon and rare book collector Boris Balkan (played to the hilt by Frank Langella, who nearly steals the show)to authenticate his copy of the Nine Gates to the Kingdom of Shadows (De Umbrarum Regni Novem Portis).<br />That innocent-sounding assignment isn't nearly as easy as it sounds. For one thing, there are three copies of the demonic tome, printed by a 17th century Venetian bookbinder (later burned at the stake for his troubles) and reputedly capable of summoning Satan; Balkan wants Corso to examine the two other volumes (one in Spain, the other in Paris) and determine which is the forgery.<br />Another complication lies with Balkan's book: its previous owner hanged himself shortly after selling his volume to Balkan, and his wealthy widow (played by a supple and cat-like Lena Olin) wants it back. And if that weren't enough, as Corso is drawn deeper into the mystery, those around him begin to die horribly and mysteriously.<br />\\"The Ninth Gate\\" is a rich, heady, delicious mystery, and its palpable sense of growing menace is given nice counterpoint by Director of Photography Darius Khondji's (\\"Se7en\\")lush cinematography, which tracks Corso on his quest through a host of forbidding and enchanting locales: from a decaying Spanish manse, to a Parisian occult library, to a Black Mass in a French castle, to a shadowy and seemingly demon-haunted Manhattan (recreated by the exiled Polanski on a backlot), with the action culminating in a ruined French fortress.<br />The look of the film constitutes a character in itself; the Black Mass in Liana Telfer's restored family chateau recalls the orgy sequence in Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut (indeed, the films echo each other in their suggestion of malefic, monstrous forces gliding beneath their gilded and luxurious surfaces). This is a film that dwells on its haunted spaces, a film full of moonlit parapets and occult libraries full of leather-bound volumes. Even the woodcut details of the Nine Gates (drawn from Reverte's book) draw the viewer into a world of recondite and forbidden knowledge. Watching the movie is like being granted admittance into a secret society.<br />The creepiness is nicely accentuated by Wojciech Kilar's haunting score, which is by turns engaging and urging Corso on (the \\"Bolero\\" like theme undergirding Coros's flight to Madrid) and warding him off.<br />It has been said that the best terror is painted on a palette of silence: \\"The Ninth Gate\\" is a quiet film, a masterwork of atmosphere whose chief terrors are never directly seen. Indeed, Polanski took Reverte's eccentric and erudite \\"Club Dumas\\" and plumbed and distilled its essence into a creepy, understatedly scary little film, a minutely detailed little cinematic treasure box whose ultimate horror takes some time to truly sink in.<br />All of the performances are well done, even the small ones. Veteran actor Jack Taylor is splendid as the last scion of a dying aristocratic Spanish family, Emmanuelle Seigneur is alternately hideous and gorgeous as the mysterious Girl that hounds Corso's footsteps (watch her face closely in the movie's final minutes), and Barbara Jefford provides an elegant turn as occult maven and scholar Baroness Kessler.<br />There are a few mis-steps, but nothing fatal: the fight between Olin's thug and the Girl by the Seine is clumsily mounted, and the henchman himself, with his platinum blonde hair and effete mannerisms, more closely resembles an extra from a Madonna video than a Satanic assassin, butthat's quibbling in a movie this rich and engaging.<br />With that out of the way: Talk about a mismatch between Marketing and Movie! I think most of the problems viewers had with \\"The Ninth Gate\\" stems from the way the film was advertised; the movie came out around the time of Arnold Schwarzenegger's \\"End of Days\\", and the marketing campaigns were similar: fire and brimstone quick cuts and heavy metal musical riffs, leading many to the conclusion that both films would offer CGI-demon slaying.<br />\\"The Ninth Gate\\" is not an action movie, nor is it straight horror. If that's what you want to see, then you really shouldn't waste your time. If, on the other hand, you want a deliciously atmospheric movie about a kind of diabolic treasure hunt (with the Devil Himself as the prize), then \\"The Ninth Gate\\" is eerily pungent, devilish fun. Old Scratch himself would be pleased., but that's quibbling in a movie this rich and engaging. <br />With that out of the way: Talk about a mismatch between Marketing and Movie!

B00005QDW5|4.0|If you are new to Pink Floyd and want to dabble in their various phases, this is the perfect album for you: it presents their admirable career non-chronologically (which actually works rather well) and gives you some of their biggest hits, as well as some of their best album tracks. Not only that, we also get the previously-unreleased &quot;Wall&quot; era gem &quot;When the Tigers Broke Free&quot;.<BR>For the older fans, this album will either confuse or infuriate. If the stuff they added doesn't work you up, what they cut out will. The most glaring for me was no &quot;Brain Damage&quot;/&quot;Eclipse&quot; to close out the album: I'm glad Syd's material wasn't left out, but the enormous DSOTM enders should be closing this album as well. &quot;Animals&quot; is not well represented, which is hard to say considering it only has 5 songs. In my opinion, they should have tried to fit the masterpiece &quot;Dogs&quot; on this album instead, a much more fitting song from one of their more overlooked albums.<BR>It's hard to cut out any Pink Floyd tracks in favor of others, but they really messed it up with nothing from &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot;. The material they included from &quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot; and the &quot;Division Bell&quot; is fine, but it's a shame that their earlier, more obscure materal was cut out. A more fitting best-of would have been a triple-disc set. This way, more material could be added, not to mention that that way &quot;Echoes&quot; and &quot;Shine On&quot; might be kept in their original lenghts. All in all, this is a solid overview of Pink Floyd's career, but it helps to have their studio albums as well, brilliant in their own right.
0385504209|3.0|From the opening pages of The Da Vinci Code, author Dan Brown grabs the reader's attention, and then holds it throughout the book.  Suspense and unanswered questions, often posed at the end of the short chapters, make it an exciting page-turner.<br />The story is based on the premise that the Holy Grail is more than just the cup from which Jesus drank at The Last Supper.  It holds secrets which the Catholic church, the predominant church of that day, does not want revealed.  Historians and others would like it otherwise.  The two factions are in a virtual battle to capture the code leading to the Holy Grail.<br />As one would expect, there is murder, villainy, and treachery along the way - all necessary features of a good mystery.  But Dan Brown offers something more, something to pique the intellect of his readers, including descriptions of architectural design, particularly the Louvre, Da Vinci's mathematical genius, and an abundance of esoteric facts about the Christian religion.<br />Christian faithfuls need not fear that reading this book may lead to doubt or corruption.  The author salvages Christian beliefs, in the end, and in my opinion, he surely regenerates faith through these words:<br />\\"Every faith in the world is based on fabrication.  That is the definition of faith...every religion describes God through metaphor, allegory and exaggeration...<br />\\"The bible represented fundamental guideposts for millions of people on the planet much the same way the Koran, Torch, and Pali Canon offer guidance to peole of other religions...<br />\\"Religious allegory has become a part of the fabric of reality.  And living that reality helps millions of people cope and be better people.\\"<br />Again, The Da Vinci Code is an intellectually interesting story as well as a thrilling, suspenseful mystery.  But are there flaws?  Yes.  Brown obviously underestimates his reader's sleuthing abilities if not their intelligence.  It was hardly believable to me that an expert symbologist did not realize immediately that he was looking at mirror writing, not some strange language!  It took this reader but an instant to recognize it.  You need know little about Da Vinci to know about that.<br />Also, Brown presumes that the reader does not know the identity of the culprit until he, the writer, explicitly says so.  He gives enough hints.  He should have identified the guilty one at the appropriate moment, then created suspense within the two unknowing, unsuspecting characters.  Brown reveals the name of the culprit about 50 pages after this reader knew it.<br />Brown states that the PHI formula is ALWAYS true in nature and in the human body.  My tape measure tells me otherwise.  Far better for him to have added that PHI is (perhaps) true in PERFECT forms of nature.  One may quibble over this and other \\"facts\\" stated by Brown.  But one may argue, also, about Da Vinci's formulas and other scientists' theories, as well as the ideas of philosophers and theologists.  Overall, The Da Vinci Code is, as a thriller and mystery, an exciting read and gives one much to think about.id not realize immediately that he was looking at mirror writing, not some strange language!

B00006RAKP|5.0|For years I dreamed of a comprehensive Elton hits album, and when this was announced, I almost fainted. I'm not a huge Elton fan (a little undernourished on the albums side), but I love and respect his songs as some of the best of the century. This is probably my favorite greatest hits album in my collection: 2 1/2 hours of solid pop gems by one of the best performers of his generation. These types of compilations are tailor for people like me: we love the artist's song, and it inspires us to investigate their studio albums to really get a feel for that artist. Brilliant collection, I can't complain.
B000053VAZ|4.0|Johnny Depp may be committing career suicide with his misquotes, but when your acting is as good as his, even lighthearted fare such as &quot;Benny &amp; Joon&quot; become gems.<br />It's heart is in the right place; most films rarely deal with behaviour disorder patients as protagonists (much less romantic leads!), but for some odd reason, it works here.  Masterson is as luminous as ever, Aidan Quinn does a fine job as the straight man, and Julianne Moore turns in a decent performance as always.  But Johnny Depp is the real star of the film, and basically gives it the pulse it desperately needs to carry it to the end.<br />Well worth the rental, but if you happen to buy it, it's still a charming little film to own.
B00008OWZC|5.0|If you've never heard Led Zeppelin live in their prime, the early 70s, you will be floored by this album!! Taken from two California gigs and fit together to make one three-hour concert, this album sparks, roars, crackles, and sets everything on fire. The times for \\"Dazed and Confused\\" and \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" will scare some people (both well over 20 minutes), but they melt away like wax: filled with solos, a blues medley, and just fiery playing, you will be stunned.<BR>It always seemed strange that Led Zeppelin, one of the best rock bands ever, was so under-represented in the live album departments. The previous one was \\"The Song Remains the Same\\", which I'm not very fond of. The puzzle is complete. Play this and set your face to stunned.
B00008EY9G|4.0|\\"Identity\\" is a unique horror movie that lives in the audience's mind forever.  Every detail keeps everyone waiting for the next scene.  Most occurances are deceiving; therefore, one must listen closely to fully understand the plot.  The deceits keep the audience anxiously awaiting the next movie viewing.  Many sudden impact surprises keep the audience's hearts pounding in tremendous startlation.<br />A family drives down a deserted road as a woman's high heel pops a tire.  As they wonder how it stumbled there, the step-father witnesses his wife getting hit by a car by an ex-cop, turned limo driver.  The group rushes for the nearest hospital, but the roads are flooded.  Their only safe shelter is a hotel.  The owner of the high heel, two newlyweds, and cop/convict are surrounded by the flood waters.  As they stumble upon the injury sight, they try to help assure the injured woman's survival.  Little do they know that the worse is yet to happen.  Their relation toward one another becomes crutial in discovering why this is happening to them.  <br />John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, Clea DuVall, Jake Busey, Alfred Molina, and others wonderfully act in this thriller.  Their individual storylines give the audience the added experience.  Cusack achieves the most demanding role of the movie.  The underrated DuVall proves in acting her character's drama that she will be a star in the years to come.  <br />\\"Identity\\" is a movie for everyone looking for a great thrill ride.  Missing a single second will miss a crutial part in the movie.  One will not be disappointed.  Some must watch it more than once to fully understand all the truths, but most will be glad they did.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Beck was supposed to make a rocking album because he wanted to hear more rock. Then the garage revolution happened, and he had his heart broken. Apparently really badly. So instead he became the new Gordon Lightfoot, hooked up Nigel Godrich, and turned his heart ache into wonderful music.  Especially worthy of praise is Godrich's flawless production, sprinkling the acoustic laments with muted drums and aural magic dust, making this more than the most depressing break-up album in a long time. A tremendous achievement, very brave of Beck. Look for his new album next summer (?) produced by the Dust Brothers.
B000002B7U|5.0|This is one of his most underrated album he ever made.  That is a shame, since this cd has some good gems on it.  There is no real weak song on this cd.  Here is a brief rundown.<br />1.  The Ultimate Sin-  Good opener with some excellent singing.<br />2.  Secret Loser- Not the best, but it is definately worth listening to.<br />3.  Never Know Why-  A big middle finger to those who believe that both him and his music are evil.<br />4.  Thank God For The Bomb-  You would almost be surprised hearing Ozzy sing this but he is only saying that the bomb should be there cause we have nothing else.<br />5.  Never-  Its not his best but once again deserves listning to.<br />6.  Lightning Strikes-  How he will continue rocking till he dies.<br />7.  Killer of Giants-  Not as good as Revelation (Mother Earth) but it ranks right up there.<br />8.  Fool Like You-  Basically about how people who foolishly live their lives are stupid.<br />9.  Shot In The Dark-  Good but overrated.  Any other song on this cd deserves as much radioplay as this song or more.<br />All in all a pretty solid effort but if you want better, buy his other underrated cd No Rest For The Wicked.  It is much better.
B00008J4P5|4.0|Although this album was unfairly hyped up to unreachable proportions (a 5-star review from Rolling Stone magazine was the clincher: this is a hype record), it is still a solid effort for the Stripes, in my opinion the best of the garage bands. Chances are 80% of the people who bought &quot;Elephant&quot; weren't even alive when the technology this album was made with was made (I know I wasn't): hell, even the Beatles weren't huge then. Raw, unedited, completely real sounds that come from Jack's increasingly hot guitar (and piano), Meg's tremendous drumming, and both of their larynxes. Jack outdoes himself on the ballads here: touching and exquisitely crafted. The rockers? They burn like a cauldron. If you dismiss this album because there's no &quot;Fell in Love With a Girl&quot;, you're an idiot. Buy it for the great music, not the hype.
B00005JKZV|5.0|I'll start with the things I didn't like about the movie, and get that out of the way, but keep in mind that I give this five stars and will still give it five stars after the following mini-rant.<br />Faramir -- WHAT is with this? This isn't Faramir! This is reincarnated Boromir at his worst! I understand that it adds to the drama of the movie, but it screws up characterization so bad it's ridiculous. And since RotK is both the climax of the trilogy and Faramir's biggest role, characterization should matter more just now, not adding unnessecary tension. He did go back to normal at the end, though, which is something, and he's supposed to be back in character for RotK. So while this didn't mess up the plot as badly as it might have, it's going to confuse people who haven't read the books.<br />Gimli -- Gimli is not comic relief. Gimli rocks. The lagging behind Aragorn and Legolas, the Wargs piling on top of him, were a little much. The &quot;Toss me&quot; lines were classic, though, and I liked &quot;If I had time I'd get this adjusted, it's a little tight across the chest,&quot; and &quot;Shall I describe it to you, or would you like me to find you a box?&quot; And I'm glad they kept his competition with Legolas to see who would kill more orcs, and that they kept some non-comical lines for him.  So, like the Faramir thing, it turned out okay, but it's also going to give people the wrong impression. Gimli has one or two amusing moments, but no more than anyone else.<br />Aragorn and the cliff -- Obviously, this was done to establish Eowyn's loving Aragorn and to reinforce Aragorn and Arwen, but it wasn't in the book. I approve of PJ's doing something with the romantic tension between Aragorn and Eowyn -- maybe it was just me, but when Faramir mentioned it in the RotK book, I thought, &quot;What? What'd I miss?&quot; -- but really, it could have been more subtle, and while it didn't interrupt the plot line too much, it was totally unnessecary and there was enough hinting already that didn't interrupt the plot AT ALL.<br />Got that out of my system. <br />Now, onto things I liked...it's hard to pick out specific things the way you can do with errors, so this will be ramble-tastic. Bear with me. <br />The emotion at the end between Frodo and Sam convinced me that RotK is going to be the tearjerker movie of the year. (The RotK preview in the special features is practically proof too.) Gollum was excellently done -- another example of special effects magic and of Andy Serkis's talent. The acting was terrific as usual. I thought Miranda Otto was amazing as Eowyn, and the actor who played Grima Wormtongue, I don't know his name, but Christ Almighty, THAT is talent. <br />I know the battle at Helm's Deep wasn't nearly that big or dramatic in the book, but honestly, I don't care. Call me a traitor to Tolkienites everywhere, but aside from the elves being there, there was nothing in it that didn't mesh with the books. Besides, give me an epic battle scene and I'm in love. If they had to cut out Shelob, then this was the big moment in TTT, and it was wonderfully done, not to mention an excellent set-up for RotK, when the war begins in earnest. (Can you tell I've got Return of the King on the brain? I can't help it, if PJ doesn't make too many mistakes, it'll be the best of the three and my new favorite movie. If he screws it up, heads will roll.) <br />All in all, an excellent movie, worth seeing and worth the three hours. I only wish it were longer.
B000000WJZ|5.0|The influence of My Bloody Valentine is especially apparent on this album by Chicago grunsters/geniuses Smashing Pumpkins, lead by the eclectic and eccentric Billy Corgan. Utilizing maybe 60 guitars track on ONE song, he creates a roaring wall of sound that amounted to one of the best albums of its generation. There's not much I can say about this album that hasn't been said, so if you were a teenager in the 90s, or just love music in general, you have no excuse not to have this masterpiece. Get it!
B00003CXA2|5.0|I'm sad i didn't watch this movie when it came out on theaters. I watched on 08-13-2003 at 11:00 AM and I just loved it. This is the reason why Tom Hanks is one of the best actors in the world. The movie is very depressing, but it really shows you the journey of a person. It shows how much a person can do NOT knowing the reasons to it. Forrest Gump is a different kind of hero. This is one of my favorites in my collection
B000002U82|5.0|Being the 810th person to review this untouchable album, there's nothing new I can bring to the discussions about its merits. All I can say is that I always enjoy listening to this album, even though it preceded me by ten years: there's always something new to find, something to marvel over again and again (the clocks in &quot;Time&quot;, the dizzying rush of &quot;Money&quot;), and great songs to enjoy over and over. Had this album been released today, not many of these wonderful tracks would have found a home on the radio, so it's especially great to see how much they are still played on rock stations. It was on the Billboard charts for decades, and 15 million people can't be wrong: &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; is one of the rare albums where blinding talent and immense hype merged to create a masterpiece. Nobody should be without this album.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|This was one of the best movies of 2003. Better than Matrix Reloaded... The Blue girl (Mystic) was awsome... great special effects... can't wait to get it on DVD
B000006NPY|5.0|This album is usually blamed on the Pumpkins' downfall, and such an allegation is just evil: anyone who expected a carbon-copy of &quot;Mellon Collie&quot; does not understand - not just the Pumpkins', but any - artists' need to keep changing. If you stay in one place, you die. Nor is this album a &quot;progress for progress' sake&quot; album: every song is crafted the way Billy Corgan wanted it to be done, and we should be glad he did it this way. The songs are gorgeous and touching, and this is an excellent CD to to be pensive to. Brilliant stuff, everyone needs this album.
B00007LTIA|5.0|This album is arguably the all time &quot;whipping boy&quot; of progressive rock. Hardcore Yes fans tend to love it and others tend to hate it. Also, due to its length and opulent title/artwork it falls prey to a multitude of Spinaltap-esque jokes.<br />Personally, I love it. Always have. I've owned this on vinyl and now 2 CD masters. This is the FIRST version that I've heard that actually sounds good. Its miraculous what Rhino have done with this. You can actually hear parts on here that were completely lost in the muddiness of previous masters.<br />I've always thought this was strong musically, but some will disagree. If you've already decided you hate this album, you might consider giving it a second shot with this master.<br />The ONLY complaint other than it taking 30 years to have this work properly mastered is that the artwork, while good for a CD remaster - is, well, its the size of a CD obviously. This cover is one of the strongest that Roger Dean did for Yes and it was meant to go on an album obviously - and BIG. I remember this hippy chick I knew bringing this over to the house with about 20 other records back in the 70's. This cover and Anderson's Olias album were two of the wildest things I think I'd ever seen!
B00009V7RF|3.0|I rated this album based on only some of the songs. I have only listen to some of the songs on the albums, and to say, it is not that impressive, the main song on the album is &quot;where is the love?&quot; It has great messages, I have to say. The other songs are plain, it did not catch me like &quot;Where Is The Love&quot; did. As for Justin Timberlake, I did not know he was on the album until I read some of the other reviews, and I have not heart BEP's other albums, so I cannot tell. &quot;Let's Get Retarded&quot; I haven't heard it, but the title sound like an offensive song, so as for that, they get a big minus. The whole album was basically revolved around the song &quot;where is the love&quot; and it is really commercial. I would not recommend,but is not an bad album. But if you have the same views as I listed above and you like the song &quot;Where is the love&quot;, get the single.
0156027321|5.0|I just finished reading this book as part of a school project and I was, in all honesty, not very much impressed by... the first half of it. True, it is a happy and interesting story of a confused boy. But this book only starts to MEAN something once you read the third part. Not wishing to spoil anything for anyone, I won't reveal anything about the contents, but I can tell you, even if the first parts of the book seem a bit conventional (although it is wonderfully fresh storytelling), the third Part will make you want to read the book over, and over and over. I actually suggest you do this.<BR>Simply amazing, it had me all nerves from the Third Part onward.
B000089RVX|5.0|ok... the first time i listened to Fallen, I thought that all the songs were about the same n that her voice never changes. Well, that's true, but after listening to the album a couple times (I always do that to an album I just got cause I wanted to get used to it n give it a chance), i found out that i could never get bored of the songs. No matter how overplayed &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; was, i still enjoyed it all the same. &quot;Going Under&quot;, &quot;Haunted&quot;, &quot;Whisper&quot;, n &quot;Tourniquet&quot; made my ears perk up. &quot;Going Under&quot; has Amy Lee's voice changed dramatically. &quot;Haunted&quot; was just so unique because the song was recorded in a form of a vocal message one would find on their phones. &quot;Tourniquet&quot;'s catchy verses were words of a suicidal lost one. &quot;Whisper&quot;'s chanting ending made me wonder what the men were saying. So basically, this album is a must have because of it's uniqueness and it's deep lyrics.
B00003CWTI|5.0|This film provides an emotionally powerful character study of emotional trauma, naked pain, bitterness, forgiveness - and raining frogs!  The cast is simply outstanding, and Paul Thomas Anderson is a brilliant writer/director.  <br />Tom Cruise gives arguably the best dramatic performance of his career, and as far as I'm concerned, was downright ROBBED of the 1999 Best Supporting Actor Oscar.  I suspect that the real reason he didn't win (and Michael Caine did for that cinematic snorefest \\"The Cider House Rules\\") is because Hollywood is just plain jealous of the guy: He's good-looking, his movies makes $$$$$ at the box office, and as his role in this film shows, he can act his butt off.  The Academy will probably make Cruise wait a while (like Steven Speilberg, Julia Roberts and Al Pacino had to wait) before bestowing Oscar gold upon him - which is a shame, because he really deserved it for this film.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|This album is one of the best albums they have.  If you've been following Iron Maiden for several years, you will enjoy this one.  I am glad Bruce came back to join the band, along with Adrian Smith.  <BR>Ignore the review from someone who only gave this album one star.  This person doesn't know what they are talking about.  <BR>Enjoy and up the irons!!!
0446677450|1.0|This book seems to written with a dictaphone some laxy evening after the author had a couple of stiff drinks.  The only challege he undertook was to write a book with no research and no guidance for the wanting reader.  The book seriously lacks any statistical or quantitative facts and instead opts to focus on a rambling storytelling nature of stories that are based much more on fiction than fact.  I would recommend that the author sober up and write something with some utility.  The problem with the book is that it has an illuminating title.  However, I can assure any future readers that the light will cease upon creasing the bind and peering in.

B00003CXE7|4.0|Gladiator is a film that shines from the first frame to the last, with it's amazing performances, breathtaking cinematography and outstanding direction.<br />The film is about a Roman General, named Maximus (played wondefully by Russell Crowe) who is betrayed by a corrupt prince, who murdered his family; and comes to Rome as a Gladiator to seek revenge.<br />Russell Crowe is brilliant in this film. He wraps himself in this character and makes it his own, which gives the viewers a sense of compassion towards this being and understands the pain and anger that he has. Joaquin Phoenix is great in being the villian of the film; this is a role that I haven't seen him in before and his acting capabilities just shine and proves that he's an actor that has many tricks up his sleeve.<br />Director Ridley Scott, is fantastic in showing us the grand scale of The Roman Empire, with his glorious battle scenes and the magnificent scale of the Art Direction that is found with the Roman Statues and Architecture. Scott establishes that he's a director with incredible vision and oustanding declaration for what he wants to present.<br />Everything in this film is presented on a grand scale, which makes it's Oscar win for Best Picture the more deserving, since, it's a film that shows the true meaning of human emotion and a cinematic experience that can only be expressed in one word: Epic
B000069HK2|5.0|This band is so awesome because even if you don't like bands that<BR>just scream constantly for no reason, Bert McCracken (spelling?),<BR>can sing and scream, but it goes well together.

B00009V7P8|5.0|I don't know why it took so long for everyone in North America to find out about Damien Rice but now that he is here all of us folkish fans can enjoy.  Practically every song sticks out especially Volcano, cannonball, and woman like a man.  I am not so easy to please musically but this album did it for me with fantastic lyrics, some great guitar playing, and a nice touch of passion in the playing.
B000099T2L|5.0|With the exception of 2 songs, (signs, virgo), this album is off the hook.  Some knock that she only had a few club songs and the rest were ballads but these ballads separate true singers from flops (see ashanti, lumidee). She displays her entire vocal range from low to high and has something for everyone.  I could listen to this cd over and over again, and I do.

078322737X|5.0|I saw this film and Diner (1982) when each was first released and have since followed with interest the subsequent careers of their youthful lead actors, notably Richard Dreyfuss, Ron Howard, Charles Martin Smith and Cindy Williams in American Graffiti and Steve Guttenberg, Daniel Stern, Mickey Rourke, Kevin Bacon, Ellen Barkin, and Paul Reiser in Diner. Separated by nine years, the two films offer informative as well as entertaining perspectives on their respective youth cultures. George Lucas directed this film which focuses on Modesto (California) during the late-summer of 1962. The screenplay and cinematography are seamlessly integrated with 4l popular tunes which comprise the soundtrack. Most of the central characters can be viewed as \\"tweeners,\\" in awkward transition from one phase of life to another. For example, Curt Henderson (Dreyfuss) will soon depart for college but seems ambivalent about that. The others' plans are even less certain.<br /><br />Meanwhile, together or separately, they spend their evenings cruising around town. (All of the scenes are at night.) I enjoyed the humor, some of it poignant, and could identify with many of the situations which closely resemble those of my own teenage years in Chicago. Keep an eye open for Harrison Ford in a brief appearance as Bob Falfa. Who knew then what awaited him next: a minor part in The Conversation (1974) and then starring roles in Lucas' Star Wars (1977) and Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981). Of course, I have no idea how appealing American Graffiti will be to those born since (let's say) 1985 but it is still great fun for many of us born before then and will perhaps be of greatest interest to cultural anthropologists who study the teenage culture in the U.S. in the 1960s. For me a sobering thought with which I conclude this brief commentary: if Curt (Dreyfuss), Steve (Ron Howard), Terry (Smith), and Laurie (Cindy Williams) were real people and alive today, they would be mid-60s. Hmmmmmmm....<br /><br />If you purchase the DVD version (which I strongly recommend), be sure to check out the documentary \\"The Making of American Graffiti\\" which features interviews with director George Lucas, executive producer Francis Coppola, and other cast and crew members as well as never-before-seen screen tests. Excellent stuff.f you purchase the DVD version (which I strongly recommend), be sure to check out the documentary \\"The Making of American Graffiti\\" which features interviews with director George Lucas, executive producer Francis Coppola, and other cast and crew members as well as never-before-seen screen tests.

0393057658|4.0|I really enjoyed every chapter of Michael Lewis' Moneyball.  It took me only one week to read, and I found that I could never put it down once I started reading (I'm a college kid, I even missed an early class from reading this book too early in the morning.)  I enjoy the field of statistics, and I am a big baseball guy, so this book made sense for me to buy.<br />What I found most fascinating was the way the A's evaluate batters and pitchers.  THeir drafts really did go very well each year, although they never did really explain why high school pitchers are worse to draft than college pitchers.  For batters, on base percentage, number of pitches taken, and slugging percentage, and extra base hits are the best ways to evaluate, while for pitchers, it's strikeout to walk ratio, homers allowed, ground ball to fly ball ratio, and extra base hits given up.  What makes it so fascinating is that the standards for evaluating players (avg/HR/RBI for hitters, and W-L, ERA, WHIP for pitchers) are very rarely, if ever, considered when evaluating the talent.)  What Billy did at the Trading Deadline was unique, and I think that other GMs should get some ideas from him and try to rip off other GMs like Billy did.  The stories of Scott Hatteberg, Billy Beane himself, and Chad Bradford were also really interesting. <br />However, a little too much credit is given to Billy Beane.  More credit should have been given to his assistant, Paul DePodesta, his scouts, and his coaching staff, in particular Rick Peterson, his pitching coach.  This book also doesn't mention the aspects of the A's that have failed since Beane took over as GM (never past the first round of the Playoffs, an offense that even with Jason Giambi was only mediocre overall because of the greatness of the Big 3 in the starting rotation, and some bad acquisitions (Terrence Long, Carlos Pena, Johnny Damon, John Mabry, among others), and the fact that his choir boy manager in Art Howe was right more times than he gave himcredit for.  Billy Beane might be very creative and might be very successful in correlation to his team's payroll, but he is far from a &quot;genius&quot;.  <br />Just one piece of information that confuses me: after this book was written, at the trading deadline in 2003, Billy Beane traded a couple of decent pitching prospects for Cincinatti Reds outfielder Jose Guillen, who is the total opposite of a player Billy Beane likes.  Guillen might have put up good power numbers the first part of the season, but he draws very few walks, takes very few pitches at the plate, strikes out a whole lot (1 in every 5.2 plate appearances), and his career OPS before 2003 was below .700.  He's also been a big disappointment this year as an Athletic.....which makes me wonder why Billy thought he would be a great acquisition.
B000001F5A|3.0|I shall begin with admitting to never have seen the movie Antarctica. I hope this does not stir any preconceptions at the address of the reader, despite realising this might just be the case with me. How can you judge a soundtrack without knowing the interaction it has with the movie it was written for? I strengthen myself with the notion that I did see Blade Runner -another movie with a Vangelis soundtrack.<br />Moreover, I do know this: the music is meant to give the tranquil, sharp, unending whiteness of Antarctica a tangible shape. I can tell it from listening to the composition. I can tell it from the music: the icy chords, the Japanese winds, the drums of wide, open plains and percussions of travel.<br />This is music invigorating in its simplicity and mood. This is what Vangelis does best. I dare write this review because I know precisely how the music interacts with the film: it provides a soul to the group of weary travellers in landscapes of hostile beauty. I dare say this music interacts seamlessly with the visuals.<br />For that, I even dare giving this album three stars.<br />Bram Janssen<br />The Netherlands
B00005JM0B|5.0|This movie was one of the best movies that i've seen in a long time. Arnold kicks butt in this new action film. It is one, two hour long chase scene that keeps you glued to your seat the whole way through. This is a have to see movie.
B000002IZM|4.0|Blade Runner has become one of the world's most iconic science fiction movies, and that is not simply due to Philip K. Dick's evocative narrative; nor is it merely Ridley Scott's photography and SFX - nor the actors' talents (especially Ford and Hauer). It is these factors combined that makes it the classic that it has become.<br />Vangelis' composition of moody strings and hypnotic percussion provides the glue. More than any other element, does the music set the necessary dreary, midnight atmosphere that prevails through the entire picture.<br />Normally, I do not like excerpts of conversation throughout soundtracks, but this album is the sole exception. In some way, the dialogues become instruments playing along with the background music, adding to the whole of melancholic arrangements.<br />Are you eager to have a Vangelis soundtrack in your collection? Have you heard some of his music and wish to explore his oeuvre? Together with Conquest Of Paradise (also a Ridley Scott movie), this is the soundtrack to acquire.<br />This one gets four stars.<br />Bram Janssen<br />The Netherlands

B0000560X3|5.0|Machine Head - the best Deep Purple album. For me. I listen this album thousand times, I had vynil, later - cd, and now I listening dvd audio almost every day. Like new!

B000002IWQ|5.0|Several years ago - back in the good old days when cassettes were still easy to find - I heard a song by a group I hadn't heard before (Rush). Armed with nothing but the name of the band, I went right out and bought a copy of all four cassettes that Borders' had in stock - &quot;Exit Stage Left&quot;, &quot;Test For Echo&quot;, &quot;Counterparts&quot;, and &quot;Roll The Bones&quot;. The song I sought was on the oldest collection (ESL) - but the real treasure was on this collection: &quot;Nobody's Hero&quot;. I'm not much for musicology, but I know humanity - and a genuine human being wrote &quot;Nobody's Hero&quot;.

B0000549B0|5.0|Even if Mr Dowd was a drunk, I'm sure he'd never come right out and explicitly accuse another of, um, indulging to excess. I don't believe Mr Dowd is anything of the sort; why are only drunks permitted unusual insights? Was the prophet Samuel a drunk? Hardly. Of the entire cast of characters, Mr Dowd is the only truly civilized individual; while the doctors and the nurse approach decency, they are afflicted with the conviction that they are entitled to judge others' ways of life. No, gentle friends, if you enjoy the company of decent, civilized individuals, warm and generous to a fault, I suggest acquiring a copy of this lovely tale.
B000053VAZ|4.0|Out of all the Johnny Depp movies I have seen (and that's all of them) I would have to say that Benny &amp; Joon is his best performance. This movie displays his versatility as an actor, proving that he can do anything. Johnny gives a performance that no other actor could or would do because of their vanity. This film shows that he is willing to do anything for the performance; what an amazing actor!!!
B00009V7PJ|5.0|... I couldn't believe how well this DVD was rated. I bought it to see it first hand. Results: All reviews were right. The show is awesome an audio was incredible good...<br />A must have for your DVD collection.
B000002B30|3.0|In my opinion, Springsteen's greatest work was on his early albums with the E Street Band (in order of preference):  Born to Run, Darkness on the Edge of Town, The Wild &amp; The Innocent, and Greetings from Asbury Park.  I think these albums reflect the real Springsteen.  His later work seems driven more by appeal to the mass radio market (e.g., Born in the USA).<br />Therefore I don't think it's accurate to call the songs on this album his greatest hits.  It only includes one song, &quot;Badlands,&quot; from Darkness on the Edge of Town, and no songs from Wild &amp; Innocent or Greetings.  How can you make a list of his greatest songs without including songs like &quot;Lost in the Flood,&quot; &quot;Jungeland,&quot; &quot;Incident on 57th Street,&quot; &quot;Rosalita,&quot; or &quot;Backstreets&quot;?  Any one of those songs could easily replace most of the songs included on the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; CD.  If you want Springsteen's &quot;greatest&quot;, I believe you would get much more for your money by buying &quot;Born to Run,&quot; &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town,&quot; and &quot;Wild &amp; Innocent.&quot;
B000001Y5J|5.0|I remember the first time I heard this album back in 1992-93, it hooked me right away. I had heard stuff from Pretty Hate Machine, and didn't think too much about the synth-poppy feel of it, but this one was hard, gritty, angry and raw. This is what made me a NIN fan. I like Pretty Hate Machine, I get Downward Spiral, I thought Fragile was going to be better, but this album reached in, grab my insides, flailed me with them and then screamed my brains out. Happiness in Slavery was one of my favorite tracks on any CD for quite a while, but in recent years Wish and Gave Up both became so much more than they ever had been before. Give it a listen, buy it, and shove it down other people's throats. This is what true NIN fans are all about.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|This album is the best thing I've heard in years. And don't get me wrong. You will not feel that way after the first listen. But your curiosity will make you listen a second time and then your hooked. Its a great story with a million holes and you feel that if you listen hard enough, the holes will fill in. I've listened to it 20 times and I'm still discovering things. Buy it and see.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Even if you've never been a CASH fan in the past, this CD is so perfectly cool that you are bound to be blown away by the scope of artistic craft.<br />The great level of production and material inserted on this CD combined with the fragile quality and honest vocal interpretation  from Mr.Cash do make this CD one to be owned by all music fans.<br />Johnny Cash will always remain one of the true vocal artists originating from America.<br />This CD is the perfect ending chapter to highlight and capture most of the essence, originality of JOHNNY CASH.<br />Up to the last note on this CD, Mr Cash demonstrates to his audience what it is to be an real artist always searching for sincere growth in music.<br />If I could award more stars to this CD, I would ! That is how good the MAN IN BLACK is on this CD!
B00006GFAB|4.0|KISS has had a number of &quot;Best Of&quot; and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; CDs, but this one is the best. It does have a few problems though.1 It tends to focus on Paul Stanley more then any of the others.  Stanley wrote some of best KISS songs, but some on this CD are not that substantial. Gene Simmons &quot;Goin Blind&quot; sould be there insted of &quot;Got to Choose&quot;.2 Ace Frehley is almost completley ignored. There are none of his KISS songs, only &quot;New York Groove&quot;, a very good song, but if you are going to include songs from the solo albums there sould be one from each. &quot;Cold Gin&quot; should be there insted. Although I don't like &quot;Shock Me&quot; it was a interesting chapter in KISS history. It was Frehley's first lead vocal, and should be there insted of Stanley's &quot;I stole your love&quot;.3 &quot;Dynasty 1979&quot; is underated album. One more song from it would have been nice(altough &quot;I was made for lovin' you&quot; is the best). That all being said, it is still the best KISS compilation out there.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Theres not much more anyone can add thats already been said about this collection.BMG,using 2 American charts(Billboard,<BR>and the now defunct Cashbox)along with the British charts,<BR>have put together what should be the central piece of the Elvis<BR>catologue for years to come.Whats amazing about the music here<BR>are the seemingly endless genres that the man covered througout<BR>his storied career.The classic 50s rock and roll(Hound Dog,<BR>Heartbreak Hotel,Jailhouse Rock)early 60s power pop(Its Now Or Never,His Latest Flame,)crystal clear vocals on ballads(Are<BR>You Lonesome Tonight,Cant Help Falling In Love,Shes Not You)<BR>late 60s early 70s ageless pop(The Wonder Of You,Suspicious Minds Burning Love).<BR>Theres even a remix song(A Little Less Conversation)that went<BR>to #1 in Britain in 02.All the songs on this cd are classics,<BR>and anybody just starting thier Elvis collection should start<BR>here,then get the Sun sessions cd (beautifully done on a double cd).Only one question;why did BMG substitute alternate takes for A Fool Such as I and The Wonder Of You?
B0000BYM3K|5.0|When I heard that Iron Maiden was about to release this album I got really excited, but then I doubted aboutit remembering what happened with Metallica on \\"St. Anger\\" (no matter what anybody tells me, for me that album [is bad]). When i got it i came home and listened to it, and my first impression was \\"It sounds pretty good\\". Then, by listening to it more and more, i find that it's a pretty good album. Best song for me is Rainmaker, it has some of that energy and amazing guitar work. however there is a song i did not like at all: paschendale. Well nothing's perfect. But i must say that I'm glad about the fact that Iron Maiden is still alive, and still rocks.
B000062X9B|5.0|If you love Johnny Cash, you must have all four of the American Recordings series, but all true music lovers should also have them, if only to serve as an example of how a master musicians last years can bring his greatest art.More specifically, Cash's rendering of &quot;The Mercy Seat&quot; rivals his more recent&quot;Hurt&quot;(American Recordings 4)as the most haunting,soul-baring recording in music history.Using the metaphor of a condemned man nearing execution, he places us directly into the heart of any man facing the reality of death, the only moment when too many of us realize that we are not immortal. It brought me to tears the first time I heard it. I commented to those with me that it truly was a musical diamond, the perfect essence of an artist at his peak of knowledge and wisdom(if not skill).Cash has not only entertained us for generations, he has shared his love of life, God, music, and Man with us, always with honesty, integrity, and humor. He never pretended to be more than a simple man, with faults and weaknesses like us all, but he had the faith,the heart,and strength to work to make things better.The songs he has given us as he nears the end will help us all to face those times with dignity and courage, as he did. Vaya con Dios,Mr.Johnny Cash,I will miss you like a favorite Uncle, and always treasure your musical legacy.
B00005JM4Z|5.0|This Movie will have your heart beating FAST and FURIOUS yet again. This movie takes place in Miami and has some of the most AMAZING Heart pounding RACING on screen just as the original movie did. The movie is about an X cop on the run played by PAUL WALKER (Varsity Blues & The Joy Ride) who decides to go undercover to uncover a drug deal after having his arm twisted by the cops. He askes for his childhood pal played by buff Tyrese to be his partner. If the two can uncover the drug deal they will both get their records with the cops cleared and have a new chance for a fresh start. This is one of those movies that will have you on the edge of your seat. I give this movie 5 stars. Not art, but good Acting, Great racing sequences and a great flick!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|What can I say?  The Mighty Maiden has done it again.  &quot;Dance Of Death&quot; is simply put a &quot;classic.&quot;  The songs &quot;Dance Of Death&quot;, Paschendale&quot;, and &quot;Montsegur&quot; are epic classics.  Every song top to bottom is amazing.  This album is remeniscent of old Maiden material.  This is what metal is supposed to be.  Heavy!  Blazing guitars, pounding drums, and the soaring vocals,of the one and only, Bruce Dickinson.  It doesn't get better than that.  Buy the album you will definetly will not regret it.
B00009V7T2|5.0|this album is definitely worth the money and the listen.  it is nice to hear young and innovative, yet solid rock-n-roll nowadays.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I would give this 4.5 stars.  Great music, worth getting.  I still perfer the original &quot;Rage Against the Machine&quot; and &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot;, but if you like them you will like this album.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|Being a washed-up 80's bass player, Iron Maiden is, and has always been, high on my list of inspirations.  But after listening to Dance of Death several times now, I've grown a bit tired of waiting for these guys to put something out that'll  win back their American audience.  We'll never again hear a Maiden capable of writing outstanding music comparable to Number of the Beast or Powerslave, and here's why: Janick Gers.  I gotta hand it to them - it's great that they can all reunite in the classic lineup with Bruce and Adrian and still have the decency not to just dismiss Janick because he's served his purpose as a replacement guitarist.  But the three guitar attack is just way too much.  It overwhelms Steve's bass, which used to be galloping right out in front relentlessly.  Now you can barely tell it's there.  Janick needs to go.  His playing style is way too flashy and poser (if you've ever seen him live you know what I mean).  That said, I was skeptical about this album after hearing the pre release of Wildest Dreams-OK song, lame chorus.  There are, however, some gems here.  Rainmaker is a good, catchy piece that has meaningful lyrics.  Most of the rest of the beginning of the album is average.  The title track could've been great, if not for the extremely silly &quot;Riverdance&quot; guitar solos.  But hold on - make it to the end of the disc and you'll be treated to some great songs.  Paschendale is one of the best from them I've heard in a long time with it's epic story, great vocals, and very somber and creepy, almost computer-like opening guitar part.  Face in the Sand started out very similar to boring stuff they've done countless times before, and I nearly skipped over it, but then Steve's bass of Iron Maiden Old came pounding through along with a double bass stomping from drummer Nicko that just blew me away.  Add to that a very produced yet rocking Age of Innocence and the epic Journeyman, and you have a pretty good album that starts iffy, but ends well.  And as a final note, would somebody please rehire Derek Riggs to draw these guys a decent album cover?  As a digital artist myself, I just have to say that all this 3D modeling computer garbage is fine for video games, but as a still piece looks really untextured, boring, lazy, and is no substitute for the hand-drawn masterpieces of their past records.ll.

B00009ZYC1|1.0|Considering that this disc lacks a Widescreen version of the film and the \\"extras\\" disc the original boasted, I would definitely not recommend buying this mess.  Why do studios re-release DVDs with fewer features and in Full Screen only?  The \\"extras\\" are part of why DVD is such a success.  Furthermore, widescreen TVs are starting to penetrate the mainstream.  In a few years High Definition widescreen TV will be a significant presence.  Who will want Full Screen DVDs then?
B00008AOS5|5.0|This movie, based on the first &quot;Hannibal Lecter&quot; novel by Thomas Harris of the same name, stars Sir Anthony Hopkins, as Dr. Hannibal &quot;the Cannibal&quot; Lecter.  With fine performances all around, by Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes (who does a particularly disturbing turn as a serial killer called the &quot;Tooth Fairy&quot; [but one you wouldn't want to visit you at night]), and Anthony Heald, as the arrogant Dr. Chilton, among others; it's Hopkins's chilling turn, as Dr. Lecter, that makes this movie work [if they'd gotten anyone else, it wouldn't have].  It's clever how they allude to the next movie by Ed Norton's reference to a young woman who wants to see Dr. Lecter, and Hopkin's says:  &quot;What's her name?&quot;  [Of course, it's Clarice Starling, to be played by Jodie Foster, in Silence Of The Lambs.]  Excellent. A worthy entry in the series along with the two &quot;sequels&quot;.  Also worth a look, for a slightly different take on the first &quot;Lecter&quot; book, is Manhunter with William Petersen (now of C.S.I.)
6305546789|5.0|Where to begin? This movie is a masterpiece. It's infamous as the movie that created the slasher genre that dominated the movie industry in the '80s, yet no splatter flick (not even Friday the 13th, which I love) could compare to Halloween. The acting is well-done (something you won't see in any slasher), the music is excellent, and I have yet to see any movie created since then top this film's scare factor.<br />The most impressive thing about this film is that it has close to no blood, and still managed to make me jump out of my seat constantly. It goes to show that all the gore in the world doesn't make a movie scary (exemplified by the truly horrible Halloween sequels - poor Michael).
B000002ULO|4.0|Ahhh... Flaiming Pie! Thank you Paul McCartney for this album. Before I start this review I must state that this is my personal favorite of all paul albums.. With that said, I will attempt to give a fair review of it to the average listener..<br />Released in 1997, Paul hit #2 in his first week on the charts with Flaiming Pie. A very 'bare' album, it features mainly Paul himself on all the instruments (Featuring Jeff Lynne, Ringo Starr, James McCartney, and Steve Miller assisting). With simple arraingements and great lyrics throughout, Paul brought himself back to similar situations of recording(ala The White Album).<br />With McCartney playing as the core rhythm section on all but two tracks (Ringo on drums for Beautiful Night and Really Love You) it brings an intimacy and an unpolished feel that has bogged down many of pauls output since the mid seventies. By playing all natural instruments (including NO synths), it makes this album a pleasant experience throughout.<br />But in comes my only complaint to the album... Jeff Lynne in his producing loves to make sounds as bare and loose as possible. This works great for the guitar, bass, and keyboard tracks, but his drum recordings always come through with a very 'boxy' sound. When he records his vocals, he barely, if ever, uses effects to make the vocals shine a little more to create an ambient effect. These are the only reasons I am rating this album at a '4', and not '5'...<br />With that out of the way, lets focus on the material itself. The melodies in the tracks are as strong as ever. Classic McCartney really. But the stand out (which is what suprised most McCartney Nay-sayers) is the lyrics. For the first time in quite a while, Pauls lyrics are very stripped down and bare with simple, clear messages in them. Now of course you have the one or two on the album (Really Love you, Used To Be Bad) that are filler, but they actually seem fun and playful paired with these finely crafted 'compositions'. George Martin (former Beatles Producer) lended a hand on scoring some orchestral arraingements on a few songs here, and he is even quoted as telling paul about the album \\"Your Back!\\"<br />He's definately back in deed! And Paul, what a fitting album to a very retrospective time in your life. Now if we can just keep you in this frame of mind................<br />Buy It! It grows on you...<br />All The Best, The AndyMan!(former Beatles Producer) lended a hand on scoring some orchestral arraingements on a few songs here, and he is even quoted as telling paul about the album \\"Your Back!\\"   <br />He's definately back in deed! And Paul, what a fitting album to a very retrospective time in your life. Now if we can just keep you in this frame of mind................<br />Buy It! It grows on you...<br />All The Best, The AndyMan!
B0000028M7|5.0|Let me first of all say that Alice In Chains is one of my favorite bands ever, and this is one of my favorite CDs ever.<br />On to what makes this CD so awesome. Of course, we all know that Layne is one of the best singers in the history of mankind; many have tried to imitate his voice, and all have failed. He had a unique voice that was completely his own (though a friend of mine says his voice is a Kurt Cobain ripoff - I don't know what he's smoking). Jerry Cantrell is an incredible guitarist, and easily the best of the grunge era. The other two band members (whose names temporarily escape me) were also quite good; they all just flow together and create an amazing sound.<br />And the lyrics, of course, the lyrics. Those unfamiliar with Alice In Chains should be warned that this album is relentlessly depressing; the only time it ever lets up is with Rooster, a tribute to Jerry Cantrell's father, who survived Vietnam. Otherwise, the album is awash in drug use and darkness; there's almost no hope in any of these songs. Yet there still seems to be a vibe, especially in &quot;Would?&quot;, that Layne is going to do everything in his power to combat the drugs before they take him. And take him they did, sadly.<br />Rest In Peace, Layne Staley.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|That's what I thought when I first saw this movie - it is amazing.  The movie is at times a little hard to follow, and watching it more than once, I understood it a little more and was able to catch a lot of things that I did not catch the first time around.  The characters were very well done.  They all tried to remain together in their struggle to make money in the drug world, but all it did was pull them further apart and deeper into addiction.  Whether by accident or on purpose, the drug use and its affects makes a person seriously rethink any thought of taking diet pills or, worse, more addictive and illegal substances.  The soundtrack is equally as chilling, setting a beautiful background to the character's ultimate attachments.  This movies is a thinker, recommended to anyone who wants to have a movie to talk about and recommend to people for months and years to come.  Definitely a &quot;YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS&quot; kind of movie!

Paul Atreides, accompanied by his mother Jessica, must avenge those killed by the Harkonnens and reclaim what is rightfully his.<br />It sounds average on paper, but when you read it and think on the many thought-provoking philosophical statements for hours on end, or thrill to the exciting and complicated plot, you'll realize what this book truly is: a masterpiece.<br />Now I just need to see the movies.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|As one reviewer wrote, you either like this movie or you hate this movie - there is no in between.  IF you like theatre; IF you like over-abundance; IF you like musicals; IF you like a style like Baz Luhrman (think the more recent \\"Romeo & Juliet\\") and his flare for telling a story in an inordinately colorful way, then you will love this movie.<br />I loved everything about it.  From the costumes to the story, every part of it made me smile.  I laughed and I cried.  Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor were amazing, as was the entire cast, all using their own, undubbed voices for their songs.  I loved that they used modern songs in the different areas of the movie that were sung by the cast, not just thrown in there.  Those songs not being sung by the original artists really gave it the feel that I was in the theatre, not watching a movie.<br />I truly loved this movie.  If you do not like any of the \\"IF's\\" I mentioned above, then you probably won't like it.  I do, however, recommend that you see it just once, because you never know.  \\"The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.\\"
B00003W8NM|5.0|A side-splitting comedy, a heart-pounding thriller and a thought-provoking social statement all at once, Fight Club requires several watches to comprehend (it'd also be better to read the book before seeing this). But once you fully understand the plot and take it all in, you'll be astonished at the brilliance of this film.<br />The movie begins with our narrator, Jack, staring at a gun sticking right in his mouth; &quot;People are always asking me, do I know Tyler Durden?&quot; he tells us. I won't say anything more so as not to risk spoiling anything. The acting is superb (particularly from Edward Norton, who plays Jack). The film is full of explosive ideas as well; for instance, there are many anti-consumerism messages. Brad Pitt's character points out to Norton that &quot;the things you own end up owning you.&quot; A little bit ironic considering how well this movie was advertised and marketed by FOX, but ah well.<br />I really can't think of much else to say about this movie; I'm starting to get writer's block so I'll stop here before I start to ramble incoherently. Let me just say that if you haven't seen this movie, you simply haven't lived.

B00005JKHN|5.0|When the royal family cibducts birthday festivities for their newborn dauhgter, Aurora, they neglect to invite the evil Maleficent.  She in turn curses the young child, that before sunset on her 16th birthday, she will prick her finger on a spinning wheel and perish.  To save her from such a dire fate, three good fairies take the young princess into the woods to protect her.  What follows after is one of Walt Disney's most beautifully animated films.  The story is basic fairy tale stuff: a princess in danger, a charming prince battles the forces of evil to save her, and everyone lives happily ever after.<br />Two things that set this apart from other Disney films are first, the adaptation of Tchaikovsky's music for the ballet \\"The Sleeping Beauty,\\" which gives us the beautiful song \\"Once Upon a Dream.\\"  The second is the stunning art work of Eyvind Earle: marvellously detailed landscapes that could almost be tapestries hanging in some centuries-old castle.  that alone makes this DVD worth watcing.  But, Disney has included both the original widescreen release and the full-screen version from when the movie first came out on VHS.  The tons of extras including the making of the film, a Princess Persnoality game, the award-winning short film \\"Grand Canyon,\\" and much more make this one of the best DVDs to be released in 2003.
B000002H2H|5.0|Ride the Lightning is by far the greatest Metallica album to date. Its continuos 110% total heavy metal is only twice broken by the amazing guitar harmonies of call of Ktulu and the mellow suicidle yet still brilliant fade to black. Ride the Lightning is graced by the outstanding Ride the Lightning and For Whom the Bell Tolls. Which are by far my favorite Metallica songs. Ride the Lightning is money well spent and an incredible album. By writing this reveiw i just wanted to spread Ride the Lightnings legacy to other aspiring heavy metal fans.
034537410X|3.0|On the one hand I found this (very cheap and handy)book very useful in that it contains detailed, clear descriptions of lots of different techniques for inducing lucid dreams. I often read it in the dead of the night after my first awakening in order to focus my mind on lucid dreaming before going to sleep again and I have found it very effective in inducing a heightened state of consciousness in dreams.<br />On the other hand, this is a very irritating book because of Laberge's dogmatic insistence that dreams are just mental constructions, illusions created by the brain, which in philosophical jargon I term a typical case of scientific reductionism: the \\"nothing more than\\" disease which afflicts the whole scientific establishment in the West.<br />Although the author does not realize it, such a trivial theory undermines his whole case for trying to have lucid dreams and getting answers to deep questions from dreams in the first place: why should one bother about illusions? Besides, if the content of dreams comes solely from one's individual brain, how can one expect to find anything new in one's dreams? Obviously this is an illustration of the famous principle GI-GO (garbage in/garbage out).<br />Of course, being a Western scientist trained at Stanford University, Laberge could not possibly have come up with more exotic but perhaps more accurate explanations, namely the existence of etheric bodies and realms, which have a transpersonal nature.<br />Buy the book for the methods and tricks but look for inspiration elsewhere. Where? This is a hard question. No matter how much inspiration self-proclaimed dream guides purport to draw from their fantastic adventures in dreamland (I'm thinking of Robert Moss), I haven't as yet read a single really well-written book on dreams and lucid dreaming, although the topic is such an interesting one. All are trivial, boastful and superficial, if not downright misleading.<br />Maybe the best solution is to trust yourself and go through the whole process of trial and error with the aid of the few tricks that really work for you, tricks which you can find easily on the Internet. Unless you are a psychic, it is a long process, believe me (certainly not one that cannot be accomplished in 30 days!).whole process of trial and error with the aid of the few tricks that really work for you, tricks which you can find easily on the Internet.

B00006AL1G|5.0|I first saw this in the theater with virtually no prior knowledge about it's contents. Needless to say, I was thoroughly impressed. This DVD is a must have for anyone with even a passing interest in DJ culture. A history lesson awaits. This is an excellent product, outlining the evolution of the DJ- from the birth of the break (Kool Herc) to the modern madness of the turntablist. This is an excellent, well-constructed and very entertaining film. Even if you are not into Hip-Hop, chances are you will enjoy this documentary. If you are, I'm sure you have already seen this, if not,  BUY IT NOW! This is in my top three all-time documentaries, with 'Dogtown' and 'Freshest Kids'. This is essential viewing for all hipsters.

A lot of people say it is full of clichs, which it is, but, the reason for the clichs is made obvious at the end of the film, which is fantastic. I like films with twists in, but Identity is exceptional. I remember at the cinema, people sat there talking about the film long after the credits had finished rolling. It really made an impression.
B00005U122|4.0|Roger demonstrates his ability to put on a full blown arena rock concert. Unabashed showmanship is his forte and this DVD captures that very well. Excellent sound and video. This is completely opposite of his former bandmate David Gilmour's DVD David Gilmour-In Concert where David puts on an intimate and very musical show. Any yet, it's not Pink Floyd. How could it be? While Roger's band is skilled and puts on a great show, the vocals and guitar of Doyle Bramhall II don't contain the same smooth eloquence of Gilmour. In the same manner, Roger's voice is sorely missed on Gilmour's rendition of Comfortably Numb. Both Waters' and Gilmour's DVD's remind us old Pink Floyd fans (I was there in '73 for Dark Side of the Moon) that it's over, but we can remember how it was thanks to these two exeptional recordings. Buy them both!
B00005RY7X|5.0|This is a great CD! The best way to describe the sound on the CD is...take the Ramones, Bruce Springsteen, Elvis Costello, Queen, and Def Leppard..throw them all in a blender and mix at the fastest speed possible. While this may sound like five of the strangest musical combinations..it works quite well. I would recommend this CD to anyone who is a fan of at least two of the five bands mentioned. This is one of my favorite CDs that I bought in 2002, and I still listen to it often. The lyrics are very simple, but if you know anything about Andrew WK, then you know that they come from the heart..and he means every word he utters.
B00006LI4S|5.0|This is a great live music DVD. If you're looking for The Wall you're in the wrong place. This DVD captures the intimate side of this ex-Pink Floyd member. Gilmour effectively demonstrates his enormous contribution to his former bandmates with his smooth, apparently effortless manipulation of guitar strings. It's amazing to hear that familiar voice coming from David's gray-stubbled face, sounding as if it were still 1973. Do you want the other side of Pink Floyd? Looking for the huge arena rock concert show? This may be a disappointment for you. Buy Roger Waters-In The Flesh instead. If you're looking for a quality recording with some great songs that aren't overdone then buy this one. Roger is missed here though, especially during the two performances of Comfortably Numb. In the same respect, David's voice and guitar is missed on In The Flesh. So which is it, Gilmour or Waters? If you're a true Floyd fan, buy both.
B000077VR3|1.0|Some people think that Baz Luhrmann is a genius.  I'm not one of those people.  &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is just one of those movies that leaves you scratching your head, wondering how the script actually made it past the first draft stage, forty minutes before the movie is actually over.  Call me a tradionalist, but I believe in things like character development and plot.  &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; has neither; instead, it relies upon costume, exaggerated facial movements, and dancing moves to draw in the viewer.  <br />Perhaps Luhrmann thought he was being clever by inserting trendy pop songs and rock anthems into the script, but what he really was doing was insulting the intelligence of his viewers.  A man singing &quot;Like a Virgin?&quot;  The showgirls singing &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit?&quot;  Nicole Kidman and Ewan MacGregor shakily &quot;singing?&quot; Humorous to some, yes; annoyingly stupid to many others.<br />Yes, it's not a movie to be taken seriously, but there is silly and then there is self-indulgent.  When a director creates such a one-dimensional film, how can he expect the viewer to relate to any of the characters, whom are little more than caricatures of the most basic of human emotions?  Someone told me that the movie is all about the &quot;spectacle,&quot; but I enjoy the spectacle of the Cirque de Soleil more.  At least it showcases people doing their jobs well, which is far more than what I can say for this Frankenstein.  Do yourself a favor: skip the movie and just turn on MTV2.  You'll get the real songs and music videos!
B000002LEU|5.0|Yes, indeed, there are actually three JD albums that any record collection should have, because you just can't pin the band's music down and get the full retrospective of the group just by purchasing &quot;Closer&quot;, &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; or &quot;Substance&quot;. The first one might is arguably their gloomiest album, and it's also their most consistent work while &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; is a not quite so desperate and perhaps a little more accessible. Understandably this album is the least consistent of the three, mainly due to it's collection album format. But what it lacks in consistence it makes up in songs, being the most accessible and versatile of the three. Even though the songs are not in a chronological order you can hear the band's musical evolution from a slightly eccentric punk band into the genius it has become to be known as. Besides the ovbious treats like their singature track &quot;Love Will Tear Us Apart&quot; it offers many less known masterpieces. Highly recommendede, just don't think this gives you the full perspective, since this is just a one side of the cubicle. Or something...
B00000JQFM|5.0|This is the first album I ever had in my hands from the good Joe. Weel, at first I though... what a noisy guitar guy... now I think... this was the right record to have a first listen from Satriani's work.<br />Now I find the cover interesting, then it seemed for a second class heavy metal band. It holds what I still consider the greatest gem Satchie's ever done up to now: 'Echo'.<br />Closing the album, this song shows all the deep feelings all the other more groovy or heavy songs seem to hide. It is a really moving and emotional tune. Would be nice for you to listen to it before any other song from Joe Satriani 'cos the middle part will really blow your mind.<br />There's a bunch of good quality songs as well in here. Look at that super-hero cross your sight on the first seconds of the opening title, 'Surfing With The Alien'. Surf with him and feel how nice is flying in a multi-coloured dream together with Joe the hero and his guitar... a marvel!!!!<br />Ice#9 (costed me a few seconds just to find the #) is a very melodic and driving heavy-metal rocker!!!! Stuck to the most basic rock band format, the song really rox. Try it and lose your shoes on the run!!! 'Circles' is simply quality. That clean guitar played as sixths and the great surprise at the middle (hear it, not ask for it!!!). By the way, 'Always...' is a classic and a beautiful instrumental ballad that came together with a very nice and angelic video.<br />'Lords of Karma' is how brutality rhymes with quality in Satch's guitar. The album is a masterpiece of hard rock. Listen to eat and burn your Ricky Martin's CDs with a lighter!!!!!!!!!
B00006JKOL|5.0|A classic album of great music from one of England's finest bands! This was the final album the band did with Jeffrey Hammond-Hamond on bass, and he went out with a bang! This album was one of their best, giving a great mix of the band's harder rocking stuff with the acoustic folk music influences that sent them apart from most progressive bands. Best songs include One White Duck, Cold Wind To Valhalla, and the title track. <BR>Definitely worth owning! The bonus tracks are great too.
0792164903|5.0|An American horror classic, Sleepy Hollow tells the harrowing tale of Ichabod Crane.  At the behest of the ever-wonderful Christopher Lee, Ichabod Crane travels two days journey to the town of Sleepy Hollow. It would appear that someone or something is killing the townspeople of Sleepy Hollow by beheading them. Crane, unaffected by the superstitions of the community believes the murderer to be a man and not the myth however, those who live in the Hollow know the culprit to be far from human. A dark spirit has fallen on this secluded hamlet in the person of the headless horseman. Rising from his grave each night, he seeks out the heads of those chosen to meet a grisly end. Not exactly the tale as it was originally woven, Sleepy Hollow through Tim Burton's eyes is a wonder to behold. The incredible sets coupled with top-notch storytelling; incredible special effects &amp; a simply amazing score make Sleepy Hollow one of the best horror films of recent history! <br />The audio presented is absolutely gorgeous! First let's get to the technical aspect of the audio. The center channel is crystalline in its reproduction of the dialogue for the film. The surrounds &amp; sub are in constant play as well. There is just enough sub use to create the incredibly overwhelming sense of dread used to propel the film. <br />I cannot say enough about Danny Elfman's score! Gothic &amp; big come to mind when defining the beauty of his musical work for the film. The director's commentary by Tim Burton is another well done segment on an already very well produced DVD. Both informative and heartfelt, you get a real sense of the director's perspective as he realizes his vision of this American literary classic.  <br />I saw this film when it opened &amp; was put off by its seemingly overwhelming muddy visual atmosphere. I expected it to be a dank &amp; dark film but that should have been content only, not the print of the film. Upon viewing the disc I am happy to report Paramount provided anew &amp; improved anamorphically enhanced BRIGHT and beautiful transfer! On DVD, it's like watching a whole new film! The colors are not necessarily vibrant throughout the feature but, in certain parts, namely, the party at Boltus Van Tassel's in the beginning of the film, the interior of Van Garret's coach &amp; Ichabod's initial meeting with the town leaders in the back room of Van Tassel's country manse, the colors are absolutely beautiful. <br />In addition to the great audio commentary &amp; the two trailers for the film-one theatrical &amp; one teaser, there is a 30 minute \\"Behind the Legend\\" featurette. This segment takes you behind the scenes with cast &amp; crew interviews &amp; gives you an insightful view into the production of some of the film's special effects &amp; stunts. Additionally, it paints a picture of the ensemble cast establishing the kind of atmosphere created when a group of actors that is this talented gets together with a director like Tim Burton! <br />Sleepy Hollow is one of the greatest American horror stories ever written. Till now, it had not received the kind of treatment needed to make it a classic piece of cinema as well. Tim Burton's vision is richly terrifying &amp; deliciously evil. In homage to the Hammer films of old, Tim Burton brings to life one of horror's most frightening visages, the Headless Horseman. Generally given to mixed reviews, Sleepy Hollow is just one of those tremendously atmospheric films that you either loved or you hated. I fell in love with Sleepy Hollow on my initial viewing &amp; greatly enjoyed all that Burton did with the storyline. I have to say that I am a great fan of Tim Burton's work &amp; this film further cemented that opinion. If you are looking for a good rich scare, I highly recommend this feature to you. On every level, this film makes an awesome presentation!
B00008G9JO|5.0|This is probably my favorite Tull album. Another fantastic mix of acoustic folk music sounds and hard rock. My favorite songs here are Moths, The Mouse Police Never Sleep, and the title track.
0800177177|3.0|The stuff of legends in Eastern Europe, Vampires have become a staple of the horror film industry. From Max Schreck's Count Orloff in 1922 to Lugosi's Dracula in 1931, to Lee's unforgettable performances with Hammer studios during the 50's and 60's, the vampire has been primped, gussied up and redressed with every theatrical incarnation. In Bram Stoker's Dracula, Gary Oldman dons the fangs and cape and delivers one of the most incredible performances, the count has ever seen. Visually stunning in every detail, Dracula, tells the story of a Romanian prince who slaughtered many in the name of the church only to cradle the broken body of his wife at the conclusion of his conquests. A wife he knew would be safe because of his service to the church. Seeds of betrayal and rage bloomed and in a fit of madness brought on by the sheer pain of grief, Dracul renounced all things holy and set his sights on destroying that which he once fought zealously to protect. The twists in the story and derivations from the novel are plenteous but the overall texture of the film is pleasing to both the eyes and ears. Anyway, many centuries later, Dracula sets his sights on what appears to be his deceased bride in the semblance of Lucy Westerna (Winona Ryder). Upon his arrival in Great Britain, his sole purpose is to win her hand by the manifestation of his undying love for her as opposed to controlling her mentally and forcing her to bend to his will. This is something of a new concept in Dracula lore. Instead of the general heavy villainous bloodsucker, we are presented with a conflicted soul whose heart was broken but is now mending with the anticipation of re-establishing his connection to what would prove to be a soul mate. Mind you, the story of Dracula would not be much fun if he were a meek kitten seeking out his girlfriend's attention. Bram Stoker's Dracula is full of all the tricks of the trade any good vampire film bears. Ultimately, Dracula is bound by this affair of the heart and will stop at nothing to make Lucy his for all eternity. With Dr. Abraham Van Helsing on the trail and a host of newly trained vampire hunter-killers (Nod to Peter Vincent) fast on the hoof, a confrontation of incredible size is soon to take place. Visually, there is no better vampire film. Gary Oldman's performance is nothing short of inspired. There are sights in this film that have never before been attempted. If they have been put to film, they did not bear even an inkling of the panache Coppola imbued this movie with. From set design to costumes and transformations, Bram Stoker's Dracula is at the head of the pack. Personally, I am forever a Lugosi/Lee fan but Oldman definitely put on an act that will not soon be equaled. Not since Tim Curry's Lord of Darkness in Ridley Scott's Legend, has there been a sinister presence so captivating. Simply put, Bram Stoker's Dracula is a feast for the senses and should make any fan of vampire legend/lore very happy. <br />The audio for Bram Stoker's Dracula is wonderfully presented in a very full and active DD5.1 platform that does wonders for the film's soundtrack and action. The dialogue is clear and easily understood and the movement between the speakers is tremendously involving. From the flapping of bat's wings to the smallest end of an echoed voice, the audio presentation is first rate. The sub does a great atmospheric job as well and contributes greatly to an already rich audio performance. This is a relatively aggressive mix and it really adds a wonderful measure of foreboding menace in every act of this tale. A 2-Channel stereo DD Surround platform is also included but as expected, it lacks the punch that the DD5.1 delivers in great abundance. The video for the feature is generally very good. There were a couple of instances where the images tended to be too dark for the presentation but on the whole I found the picture beautiful and well presented. Both a widescreen and full-frame version are available on the disc. For the purposes of the review, the Widescreen version was watched. The colors in the widescreen version are very rich and carry great depth. I did not notice any transfer errors other than the excessive darkness of two scenes. <br />Regarding extras, this is as bare as they come. There are literally no extras.  Additonally, the menu screens are rather old and nothing at all like the motion images or even the static menus produced of late. <br />Seeing Dracula on the big screen and then on video and finally on DVD has given me a tremendous appreciation of this film. The scale of this production is tremendous. Coppola pulled out all the stops in developing and producing a first-rate vampire movie that stands on it's own with all the other great films in this genre. Using age-old tricks, Coppola creating imagery and a palatable presence onscreen that truly moves this film in a new and exciting direction. The character of Dracula with all of it's manifestations was magnificent. This would have been a perfect disc had Columbia Tri-Star given just a smattering of the extras that are available DVD treatment. Unfortunately, they provided merely the film. If memory serves, the ad campaign for this film was pretty intense. Would have been nice to see some of that make it to the DVD so, here's to hoping for a loaded SE. Since this one of the first discs to have been released, it's possible a Special Edition could be on its way. Let's hope so!
B00008G9JN|5.0|Jethro Tull has done so many classic albums over the years, one runs out of adjectives to describe them. This is a great album, partially inspired by Ian Anderson's decision in the mid 70's to move to the English countryside. My favorite songs here are the title track, Ring Out Solstice Bells, Pibroch, and Velvet Green. The bonus tracks are nice too (though nothing we haven't heard already on the classic 20 Years Of Jethro Tull boxset).
0375823360|5.0|WOW! These have to be the best books I ever read, aside form Lord of the Rings. These books are way better than Harry Potter. They are much more origanl and will keep you on the edge of your seat with many questions. There are a lot of twists and turns as well. I know that I will read these books more than once. If you love Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings, or if you are just a Fantasy/Science-Fiction fan (like me), or even if you just like a good book now and then, then these books will leave you more than satisfied.
B000000I0Q|5.0|The very best thing to say about this album is, if you like Hackett's guitar work with Genesis, and you always wished there was one more Genesis album with him on it, well, here it is. <br />Originally recorded and released during the short hiatus following The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway tour, Voyage Of The Acolyte features a number of guests, including Phil Collins and Mike Rutherford. In other words, for most of the album, the core band is effectively 3/4's of the then current Genesis lineup (or you look at it as 3/5's of the classic Gabriel/Rutherford/Banks/ Collins/Hackett lineup). Even though Tony Banks is absent, the keyboard sounds used certainly sound like the kind of sounds that Banks normally used. The credits even list &quot;ARP synthesizer&quot; (the same make of synth Tony used on many of the classic Genesis albums). Combine that with Steve's fantastic electric guitar work and the heavy use of 12 string acoustic guitar, what you end up is effectively an extra Genesis record. <br />This is a great and very auspicious debut solo release, one which would please any fan of great work, and also please any Genesis fan.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Yeah, that's true! The Maiden have done another fantastic album. Eleven amazing new songs and nothing to complain about. I find this record a typical Maiden album.<BR>The songs are very elaborated, and at the same time very melodic and rhytmic. Bruce is singing perfectly as usual, there are fantastic guitar solos and incredible intros. The lyrics are simply super! <BR>I would recommand Dance Of The Death to every metal-fan, because it's an inevitabile part of everyone's collection!<BR>UP THE IRONS!!!

B000002GVZ|5.0|The Best Of Carly Simon is a landmark collection of works documenting the first stage of the career of this gifted singer/songwriter. Almost every song on this album received a Grammy Award nomination. One of the things that I've always loved about Carly Simon is the way her songs tell life affirming stories about childhood,loneliness,relationships and matters of the heart. Every song on this LP is a Carly Simon classic and it should be on the music library of every serious music lover. Unfortunately the Carly of today is nowhere near as the Carly of the 70's. I can't seem to get into the music that she's been doing for the last few years, it just doesn't have the spark and creativity that her songs of the seventies had. I'm still a big fan but I would like to see her do more of the music that she did in the seventies. She recorded so many wonderful albums like &quot;Anticipation&quot; (1971) &quot;No Secrets&quot; (1972) &quot;Hotcakes&quot; (1974) and this excellent collection of hits in 1975. Another album that I love is &quot;Boys In The Trees&quot; (1978) I think that was the last great album that she released, although a more recent album &quot;Letters Never Sent&quot; was pretty good. &quot;The Best Of Carly Simon&quot; is one of my favorite albums of all times. I have it on CD and cassette and I never get tired of listening to it. It's a great LP by one of the greatest voices and fantastic songwriters of the 1970's.
079213690X|5.0|In 13th Century Scotland, William Wallace (Mel Gibson) fights for the freedom of Scotland against Edward Longshanks (Patrick McGoohan), the ruler of England.

B00000J2PH|5.0|This is the greatest album that Carole King ever recorded. Every song was a hit. I'm referring to the 12 songs that are included in the original album. Tapestry, has become the largest selling album by a female recording artist in history. I think it has sold some 20 million copies since it was released 32 years ago in 1971. I love to listen to this album when it rains espcially because the rain for some reason serves as a catalyst to the melancolic feeling of the songs. This is a masterpiece for all times.

B00005JLEU|5.0|The latest of Miyazaki's works ported over to the U.S. via Disney's funding is probably one of the best animated films to hit American shores to date, even going so far as to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Picture of 2002, and it certainly deserves it.<br /><br />Set at first in modern-day Japan, the movie begins with a ten-year old girl named Chihiro moving to a new house with her parents. After a wrong turn, her father decides to make a shortcut through the woods, which leads the three to what appears to be an abandoned amusement park, where her parents find food sitting out and begin to stuff themselves like pigs. Chihiro refuses to eat and goes exploring, and as nightfall approaches, it becomes clear that this is not an abandoned amusement park, but a place thriving with activity. When she tries to find her parents to escape, she discovers that they have transformed into pigs after gorging themselves on the food of the spirits.<br /><br />To survive in this new world, Chihiro is befriended by a boy named Haku, who helps her hide from the spirits until she can reach the bath house, where she must get a job from Yu-baba or be turned into an animal like her parents.<br /><br />\\"Sprited Away\\" takes a different path than the conventional Disney film that so many are used to in animated films. For one, there aren't any musical numbers, which is almost always a plus (the only animated films I can think of where the the musical numbers set well were \\"Beauty and the Beast,\\" which had but two that worked while the rest interrupted the plot, and \\"Lilo & Stitch,\\" where the songs and story seamed together flawlessly.) The animation is also very different, consisting of Japanese animation (anime) to create characters and settings that flow very smoothly.<br /><br />There's more to the difference than simple audio and visual flavor, though. Chihiro is not the standard hero. She's a whiny, immature brat (as Yu-baba puts well) and won't stop complaining at first. It isn't until she's pressed with incredible odds and responsibilites (some of which force her to break down) that she can begin to grow up and face the strange world around her.<br /><br />That strangeness is yet another difference. The world that Miyazaki has created here is nothing short of odd, tossing in plenty of spirits and gods of Japanese folklore, and even poking fun at some of them, such as the Radish Spirit.<br /><br />Yu-baba isn't a clean \\"villain\\" either. In fact, she's more of an antagonist than a true villain, as she really is protecting her property and her ability to earn profit, while Chihiro is an invader, even if she is innocent, and threatens the spirits' way of life. Some may call this evil, but they would do the same thing when put in a position of defending what they hold dear, as petty as it may seem.<br /><br />There are themes and subtle symbolisms riding in \\"Spirited Away\\" as well. Much of it involves the effect of humans on the enviroment, as clearly evidenced when Chihiro's parents are eating the food that belongs to the spirits, or the endearing scene with the Stink Spirit. There are also things that I have yet to decipher, such as the separation between adults and children, but I really don't know. The shadow people of the train harks some sort of symbolism, but I don't know it yet (if anyone has any theories, contact me.)<br /><br />Everything about the plot and characters will take in children, adolescents, and adults. The visuals are stunning and look wonderful, only catching off when we some of the CG takes place when the train passes a house later in the movie. And then, there's the music, an absolutely wonderful score by Joe Hisaishi, who's composed scores for other Miyazaki films. \\"Reprise,\\" when matched with its scene, is enough to bring tears.<br /><br />The DVD isn't all that great, but it has a nice animation on the menu. There are a couple features, as well as some Disney trailers. The second disc has a few extras, but much isin Japanese. The trailers for \\"Spirited Away\\" will seem like poor advertising for those used to American-made trailers.<br /><br />The DVD features aren't important though. I wasn't even expecting a 2nd disc when picking this up, so it was really just a nice bonus. The real gem is the movie, in all it's wonder and glory, and it begs multiple viewing (which you'd do anyway, right? Why buy it otherwise?) If any movie deserves credit and attention, it's this one. All in all, \\"Spirited Away,\\" simply put, is beautiful...

B0000039QA|5.0|Cristopher Wallace shows his flexibility, ingenuity, and rythm in this collection of songs.  Some of them are adapted from free styles, and others from classic 'beef' songs, but as a whole the songs stand alone very well.  Furthermore, there seems to be some intangible theme past even death, or drugs, that ties everything together.  In many ways the CD is a celebration of life, the life of Notorious.  The only unfortunate part of this CD is that B.I.G was to die in '97...
B00006LLNU|5.0|Bassist Georg Holm has once said in an interview that Sigur Ros weren't a political band, and didn't necessarily have too much to say, other than the fact that they wanted to communicate emotion (subconscious, unconscious) through their instruments. Perhaps this is why the band chose to leave absolutely no credits or lyrics in the sleeve for (  ) (2002).<br />You don't necessarily need written lyrics (or titles) for this intense experience. Just close your eyes, slip into this 72-minute slice of nirvana, and follow whatever feeling states draw to the surface as you listen. Like the icy-looking cover art, this music is the equivalent of a Winter night, and the thoughts and emotions that are conjured with it: cold, beautiful, dreamy, poignant, nocturnal, encircling, haunting and soothing. While the music is &quot;cold,&quot; it isn't cold in an unemotional sense, as the album features nothing but overflowing emotion. The soundcapes are mellow, lush and elegant, while the instrumentation is generally used in ambient fashion, which allow certain atmospheres to be created more effectively. And added to this,  the tracks are mostly extended, so the album is probably not recommended for listeners who want quick blasts of aggression, or who want short, catchy pop tunes.<br />As far as my personal interpretation of the album, or what it conjures through me? I see it as an album divided into two halves (which can also be equivalent to the two parentheses): The first four tracks comprising the &quot;(&quot; half seem like the equivalent of a lonely Winter night, featuring a long snow-capped landscape, and the stars shining at their brightest above. Winter and snow in general remind me of hope, longing, and the necessity (as opposed to luxury) of love, which are what I'm reminded of when listening to the first four tracks. The music in this half is generally the more lush, elegant, dreamy,  nocturnal and mellow. Track 3 happens to be my favorite, as an elegant piano chord is repeated constantly, and used for atmospheric proportions, while the basslines ascend in a particular pattern, and lush orchestration tops it off to create an aura of bliss.<br />The &quot;)&quot; half features soundscapes that remind me of a misty dawn: a somewhat murky sunrise. While the first half seemed generally more nocturnal, there seems to be a diurnal (morning) presence on the second half: night is calm, day is active. Piano was the dominant instrument in the first half, while the second one hears the guitar dominating. This half tends to get more tense, aggressive and somewhat restless in atmosphere, and also features guitar feedback/distortion not heard in the first. Track 7 sees vocalist Jonsi using a pitch in his voice that was not heard at all in the first half.<br />This album is so dear to my heart for it's ethereal, calming, encircling, evocative and emotional nature. Atmospheric music for escapism, reading, relaxing, lovemaking and possible other pastimes. For best results, listen at nighttime, turn down all of the lights, and light up a few candles. Remember to relax, close your eyes, and let the music take you where it may. Enjoy.<br />By the way, here are the supposed songtitles that weren't listed in the sleeve:<br />1.  Vaka<br />2.

B000005ILF|3.0|\\"Mercury Falling\\" from 1996 was Sting's \\"winter\\" music release, beginning with \\"The Hounds of Winter.\\" The songs are literate stories that embrace emotions around relationships with intelligence and self-awareness. Musically, the songs are all well put together. Sting is a consummate craftsman and he always has a crack band, this time featuring Dominic Miller on guitar, Kenny Kirkland on keyboards, and Vinnie Colaiuta on drums, along with various guests. Sting also seems incapable of writing a crappy tune. So why only three stars?<br />The songs for the most part are just not that exciting to me. Sting seems to have settled into a mid-tempo adult contemporary mode and the music lacks some spark. It's fine if your looking for something at the wine bar supper club or background music for a quiet evening. I just don't think Sting has exceeded his previous work.<br />The key tracks include \\"The Hounds of Winter\\" with its wintry imagery. I also like the soul groove and slow burn of \\"Let Your Soul be the Pilot.\\" \\"You Still Touch Me\\" also has a bit of funk lite. \\"I'm So Happy I Can't Stop Crying\\" and \\"Lithium Sunset\\" both have a country-western tinge.<br />To me, the most moving song is \\"Valparaiso\\" with it's mournful strings and imagery of loneliness at Cape Horn. This song was used effectively in the film \\"White Squall.\\"<br />After this disk, Sting bounced back in a big way with \\"Brand New Day.\\"
B00008EY9G|5.0|I have read seemingly unsatisfied reviews about the movie, such suffering a mixed identity from being a mystery, thriller, &amp;/or horror story.  So, I decided to see it for myself.  Without reading the gist at the back of the DVD cover, I had little expectations to begin with.  I noticed its remarkable similarity with Agatha Christie's &quot;And then there was none&quot; (The Psycho set-up was a given).  Of course, once the sentenced serial killer was introduced in the screen, everything fell in its place &amp; the movie sort of became predictable (especially the ending). But nonetheless, it was a good twist.  Like Memento (starring Guy Pierce), I wouldn't hesitate watching it again.
B00005JLZN|4.0|I did not view &quot;The Life of David Gale&quot; as a polemic on the death penalty. I wanted to watch a good drama, am a big fan of Kevin Spacey and Kate Winslet, and was definitely not disappointed in the movie or by the actors. I want to stress that, if anything, this film demonstrates what can happen, in extreme cases, when people become carried away by their passionate fervor, advocating for or against an issue. This film is a work of fiction, and to truly enjoy it one must relax and realize that it is only a story.<br />David Gale, wonderfully portrayed by Kevin Spacey, is a brilliant philosophy professor at a major Texas university. He is a moral person, a strong and active opponent of the death penalty, a leader and organizer of Death Watch, and articulate and visible enough to debate the Governor of Texas on the issue of Capital Punishment. Gale is also an important and respected member of his community. Although it is not initially clear why his beautiful wife travels as frequently as she does, it appears that she is often away from home. He is clearly attached to his six year old son and is a wonderful, loving father.<br />Through a bizarre series of events, Gale finds himself defending his honor and reputation in the very community that has long accepted him as a colleague and friend. As his life begins to fall apart, the already hard-drinking Gale, really hits the bottle Big Time! He makes a serious effort to clean up his act and regain his life, and is helped through this terrible time by his dear friend, colleague, and fellow Death Watch activist, Constance, (Laura Linney).<br />Then fate steps in with a bizarre twist and Constance is found raped and horribly murdered on her kitchen floor. David Gale is accused, tried and convicted of the heinous crime. It is tragically ironic that a man who has dedicated himself to abolishing the death penalty, finds himself on Death Row, waiting for his own execution. He grants &quot;Bitsey&quot; Bloom, (Kate Winslet), a Pulitzer Prize-hungry journalist, three interviews, to take place on each of the three days prior to his execution. The story is told in a series of vivid, dramatically photographed flashbacks. The abrupt, disjointed, quick changing still shots of headlines, and images of the murder victim, interspersed with action shots, adds to the film's intentional sense of tension, and confusion. Perhaps this is the bewildering confusion an innocent person might feel when unjustly accused and convicted of a crime.<br />Ms. Bloom soon realizes that the story she had planned to write, is not proceeding according to plan. As she is drawn into Gale's drama, she herself becomes a passionate advocate - for Gale, and for the truth. Bloom puts her safety on the line as she frantically races against the clock for the answers to Constance Hallaway's death.<br />This is gripping suspense &amp; a ripping-good story. I found it difficult to hit the pause button on my remote when necessary. I did not foresee the ending, and I am usually pretty good at guessing &quot;what comes next.&quot; I understand that many people, may have wanted a political social action film with a strong message. This is not a &quot;strong message&quot; movie - it's a great thriller, with wonderful performances by an excellent cast. Writer Charles Randolph and director Alan Parker have done a good job of bringing this story to life, and while they will probably not be nominated for an Academy Award for their efforts, I certainly thank them for providing me with a few hours of nail-biting, riveting entertainment.<br />JANAt), a Pulitzer Prize-hungry journalist, three interviews, to take place on each of the three days prior to his execution.

B00005O3VC|5.0|The very mention of this comedic masterpiece should be enough to bring a smile to your face. Widely regarded as the very peak of sketch comedy troupe Monty Python's career, The Holy Grail has nearly become as much of a religious establishment as the dark-aged deities it spoofs. There exist lunatics around the world who are able to not only directly quote lines from this film, but to recite the entirety of the script, from start to finish, without err. And, after just a single viewing, it's easy to find yourself tempted to join their ranks.<br />The story is simple enough, and yet manages to become intertwined and entangled within itself throughout the course of the brisk 89 minute run time. King Arthur, best known for his acquisition of the sword in the stone and subsequent leadership of the knights of the round table, is featured here as a blunt, modest man... oblivious to everything going on around him, and painstakingly patient through the most bizarre of circumstances. As the story unfolds, Arthur slowly gathers his knights, briefly visits Camelot and is charged by god to retrieve the infamous Holy Grail. The troupe embarks directly on their quest, without the slightest idea of where they're headed, and eventually runs into dozens of almost unrelated hurdles along the way.<br />In print, the premise sounds painfully unfunny... almost a joke unto itself. And, perhaps if they'd stuck to their guns about the whole &quot;knights in shining armor&quot; thing, that early judgment may have been partially right. But a great deal of what makes this so fun to watch is the way the characters interact with one another, address their environments and simply carry themselves. The Knights of the Round Table chat amongst each other in a very modern, almost twentieth century style. Formalities are few and far between, and supporting characters whose entire role in any other period piece would have been limited to &quot;Yes, sire, I'll retrieve my master this very moment&quot; are here given the chance to argue the finer points of foreign birds and migratory patterns. Unimportant lackeys dive into in-depth dissertations at the drop of a hat, spiraling off into a tangent with little or no provocation. Literally hundreds of medieval cliches are addressed and promptly disposed of throughout the course of the film, while simple, obvious visual puns are thrown out like darts at every moment. It's a film that anyone can enjoy, regardless of intelligence, age or demeanor. There's literally something for everyone.<br />Immediately, only seconds after popping this DVD into your hardware and hitting the &quot;play&quot; button, something is going to strike you as a little bit odd. Something's different about this classic, but it's tough to put your finger on it until the murky opening scenes are in the past. Bluntly enough, this new restoration looks BREATHTAKING. One of the toughest things to endure about the film's earlier VHS incarnations was the god-awful quality of the video, the way everything had been overtaken by a sort of yellowish-brown hue, darkened and muddied. However, this most recent DVD release cleans up those long-standing visual stains with uncanny precision, revealing in its wake an entirely new motion picture. Wide shots of the infamous &quot;Trojan rabbit&quot; scene are awesome sights, now that the original color saturation is in place. It's honestly as though someone took a cloth and some Windex to my television screen and wiped away thirty years' worth of dust and muck. The restoration alone is worth upgrading the copy of Holy Grail in your collection from VHS to DVD.<br />Fortunately enough, though, the crews in charge of this new DVD didn't stop there. With a full two discs in the set, almost every base is covered... in addition to several spots in between. The discs come fully equipped with two feature-length commentary tracks; one from directors Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, and another from John Cleese, Eric Idle and Michael Palin. The commentary tracks are both thoroughly interesting, with the directors' chat a little more insightful and the actors' track more disjointed. Jones and Gilliam reveal a lot of obscure facts about the creation of the film that I hadn't realized, such as the involvement of rock bands Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin in the production, and is generally a much better listen than its partner track. It's strange, it almost feels like Cleese, Idle and Palin weren't even in the same room together when they recorded these audio tracks, and that various comments from each were merely spliced together at appropriate points throughout the film.<br />The Special Features section is overflowing with options, including but not limited to three sing-alongs (featuring full lyrics to the film's three notable song-and-dance numbers... if you ever wondered what they were trying to say during the incomprehensible verses of &quot;We're Knights of the Round Table,&quot; today is your lucky day), a short film titled &quot;How to Use Your Coconuts&quot; (which comes off as very, very forced and very, very stupid), a cast directory (which shows just how many hats the actors wore throughout the course of the film; Michael Palin alone played nearly a dozen characters), photos and more. In addition, the second disc showcases two unique featurettes about the film; one which was shot on set in 1974 for the BBC, and another which reunites Gilliam and Jones in the year 2000, on the location of the main castle used throughout filming.<br />Without exaggeration, I seriously cannot recommend this DVD any higher. It's not humanly possible. Whether you're a devoted, lifelong Python fan or merely someone with a passing interest in comedy in general, this is a worthwhile purchase. You won't find a better transfer of the film in your life, the list of features is almost overwhelming, the original team is represented nearly in full, through dual commentary tracks and several featurettes, and it's very affordable at the same time.

0670880728|4.0|&quot;Bridget Jones's Diary&quot; was the beginning of a small revolution in women's literature.  It is the book that has begat dozens - if not hundreds - of other books as well as entire publishing labels.  They are modeled after it in style (self-deprecation and self-defeating behaviour) as well as plot (aging single girl in the big city seeks love against parental, employment, and self-induced obstacles).<br />But none of them are quite as good!  Bridget's story has a distinctive tone comprised of an epistolary style, obsessive counting behavior (calories, cigarettes, alcohol units, calls to the British equivalent of *-69), and an unsual diction that makes it a highly entertaining read.  And Fielding has mastered the trick of romantic comedy - making the heroine so flawed and winning that we're rooting for her to find love at all costs no matter how much we believe she should be complete without it.<br />Most first-time readers of &quot;Bridget Jones's Diary&quot; will have seen the movie already.  This shouldn't hinder their enjoyment of the book; the two are more complementary than identical.  The book misses the movie's sheer narrative neatness and obvious resemblance to Austen's &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;.  However, it's much more complex (the filmmakers altered the plot a great deal) and far more humorous.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|There is no question that Brave New World was nothing short of a triumphant comeback, the likes of which hasn't been seen since Deep Purple reunited for Perfect Strangers. Dance of Death is even better yet. There is a list of things that are better. First of all, Bruce. We all know that he went through a very rough patch in the early 90's. He is all the way back, maybe even better than when he first joined. His range is incredible. Second of all, the three guitar lineup is taken advantage of much more than on &quot;World&quot;. All three of them deliver some jaw-dropping moments. Thirdly, the songwriting is top-notch. There are elements of every period of the band's history. Yet these elements were combined to make a new sound. In particular, &quot;Journeyman&quot; sounds like nothing they have ever done before. It may have taken Nicko 20 years to write a song, but he needs to keep doing it because &quot;New Frontier&quot; is an awesome song. The only negative I have, and it is a small one( not enough to dock it a star), is that &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot; is not as good as &quot;Wicker Man&quot;, a song it was obviously meant to emulate. But that is trivial, because it is still a good song. This one is a winner any way you look at it.
0375823360|5.0|Phenomenal.  These books grab you and will not let you go.  Pullman's characters are believable and moving, with a fantastic plot line.  I am a big fan of The Lord of the Rings, but His Dark Materials honestly surpasses Tolkien's epic.  I won't ruin the plot for you, but this is one trilogy that you must read!  Another terrific fantasy, but definitely one for older readers, is King and Straub's The Talisman.
B00005JKHN|5.0|Describing Princess Aurora's dream coming true as the prince of her dreams rescues her killing the evil, is a job that has no words to describe it. The songs that come in the DVD and Bonus section where they describe how the sleeping beauty was created are marvelous pieces of information that every disney collector should possess. There are very few good romantic novels available at the market to foster children's dreams, and sleeping beauty is one of them.
B000002JKA|5.0|Dream Theater is a fantastic band and this is all I will say about them because I don't want to repeat things already said by other people.  I want to point out that Dream Theater did their best things with Kevin Moore behind the keys. The unreachable Images and Words and Awake. After these albums came only some boring music with less heart and fantasy (take for example the awful, horrible, false, stupid Falling into infinity) . Of course this is not to say that Petrucci isn't a wonderful guitar player and that the other guys in the band are not good as him. It is simply to say that Kevin Moore was probably the mastermind behind DT, the creative force, the man responsible for the greatest DT compositions. When he left the band, DT lost half of their potential. Really, really sad but true.
6304077939|4.0|The movie is a work of pure genius as it goes into the subconscious mind of a sensitive boy in terrible psychological anguish, raised by people with no ability to love.  Dangerously obsessive, perhaps psychotic, parents are raising their children as if they were less than animals.  One by one we see the children losing touch with reality as their only coping mechanism.  For the duration of the movie, we are hoping that our hero Leolo will beat the odds.  This movie is best seen by professionals in the fields of psychiatry and psychology and too strong for sensitive people who are not.
B00005T30L|5.0|What is it with Hollywood? Almost everything they produce is utter dross. But from time to time something comes out of the American film industry that puts one back in touch with the reasons one had for starting to love movies in the first place and is a joy to watch from start to finish. And his must be one of the best movies to come out of 2001 from any country.<br />Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson are Enid and Rebecca, two high school graduates is an anonymous small American town. They are cool, cynical, contemptuous of all around them and desperately desperately ironic. They are so knowingly disengaged as to come out on the other side of cool in a place that is really a bit pathetic. They are completely adorable and hilariously funny. <br />The  script - by Daniel Clowes and Terry Zwigoff - Clowes wrote the graphic novel (which I haven't read) it is based on-  is perfection: razor sharp, witty, intelligent and perceptive. And it is perfectly realized by the cast. Birch and Johansson are so good that even Steve Buscemi, who has stolen most films he has appeared in and who has done nothing better, fails to steal this one. And Illeana Douglas is perfect too as a dumb ditzy hippie art teacher. <br />Buscemi plays Seymour, a lonely nerdy middle aged man who lives for his collection of old blues records. (\\"Actually, technically, what he was mostly playing would more accurately be classified in the ragtime idiom...\\") Enid and Rebecca meet him by way of looking through lonely hearts ads for losers to laugh at and call him up for a wheeze. Only Enid at least bites off more than she can chew and finds herself liking him: \\"In a way, he's such a clueless dork, he's almost kinda cool.\\" So she sets herself up, a la Diane Keaton in \\"Play It Again Sam\\", as his find-a-girlfriend consultant. Only, of course, that's not quite where things are heading and, given the demographics, it can only end in tears. Meanwhile Rebecca shows signs of starting to outpace Enid in shedding theteenage supercool poses and turning into a rather ordinary middle-American and the friendship starts to show a certain strain. <br />The main theme is a straightforward one but one rarely if ever better handled on film. It's about pretty well everyone in their late teens - desperately trying to strike all manner of cool punk attitudes, but in reality clueless, confused and vulnerable. Birch and Johansson are skilled enough comic actresses to bring the former characteristic off to wonderfully exaggerated effect; but also good enough all round actresses to bring the latter off tremendously as well. It's one of the funniest, most honest and interesting American movies of the last decade. Glorious. An instant classic.
B0000025ZK|4.0|If you are looking for straight, solid rock-and-roll, this is the ticket.  Like its predecessor, David Gilmour's self-titled album, this album is very much a reflection of the time in which it was crafted.  While some consider the 80s factor a detriment, I am not bothered by the mere fact of the time in which it was created.<br />The listener should expect excellent guitar work up to Mr. Gilmour's usual high standards, with his alternately subtle and flashy stylings.  It is clear that Mr. Gilmour is pouring his soul into his guitar, such as in &quot;Let's Get Metaphysical&quot;.  However, that same song highlights the factor that costs the album its 5th star...other than in the guitar work, innovation and subtlety are a bit lacking.  The orchestra, while pleasant-sounding, does not present any challenge to the listener's ear.  The image that comes to mind is of the sort of thing that might be played along with a figure-skating exhibition--pleasant enough, but not the sort of thing that requires you stop everything, close your eyes, and think solely of the music.  None of the chord structures or arrangements on this album are at all complex or unexpected--very standard, and there are no departures into the strange aural soundscapes one associates with Pink Floyd...it seems very likely, in light of this, of his own solo output, that this was more the doing of Richard Wright, rather than David Gilmour.  If you're seeking something a bit more avant garde, or musically challenging, that's probably the better way to go.<br />Some of the album's lyrics are good--of the calibre of Mr. Gilmour's Floyd compositions &quot;Sorrow&quot; and &quot;Coming Back to Life&quot;.  Perhaps the best examples are &quot;Near the End&quot;, &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;, and &quot;Murder&quot;.  &quot;Blue Light&quot; is also good--in a whimsical sense.  However, some other songs in my opinion either don't try enough (&quot;Until We Sleep&quot;--which basically consists of an Epicurean &quot;Live for today, gone tomorrow, that's me!&quot; attitude) or try TOO hard (&quot;Cruise&quot;, apparently an ode to an MX nuclear-tipped cruise missile).  If you seek something more lyrically challenging, I suggest exploring the works of Roger Waters.  If you want that, and still place a fairly high premium on guitar work, the best choice for you would be Amused to Death, which features Jeff Beck as frontman.<br />Probably a 3.5 is the fairest assessment, which I round to a 4 in this case.  As a straight pop-rock album, About Face does stand above most rock productions, given Mr. Gilmour's wonderful guitar talents.  This is undeniably a fun listen.  However, if you are looking for further substance, either musically or lyrically, you may find that this effort comes up short--and you may do better to explore the work of the RW's.
6305268843|5.0|There are no romance stories that I have seen on video/dvd that compare to Firelight.  Firelight is in a category all its own thanks to the talented actors &amp; the precision casting, directing and writing.  All of the 5 star reviews that I have read say it all.  I don't understand why this is not out on DVD format.  This film is a genius artistic endeavor.  I guess I will have to buy the VHS format.
B00005JKN9|1.0|This was by far the worst movie I saw last year.<br />I had read an article about the backstory in Smithsonian and<br />thought it would be a pretty good movie to see. The amount<br />of blood in this movie is ludicrous. I mean from the first<br />scene to the end it is like one big violent blood-letting.<br />The plot if you want to call it that because it is pretty far<br />from it, is laughable. The story seems to follow some kind of<br />path until midway thru when (spoiler) Leonardo Dicaprio's character is convinced to kill bill (Daniel Day-Lewis' character)<br />which makes no sense. Then the rest of the movie plays out<br />like a long violent cliche'. I mean really the cop who became crooked, the hooker with the heart of gold, the pyschopathic<br />madman who controls everything and everyone. It is just ridiculous.<br />I will say this though. Daniel Day Lewis did a wonderful bit of acting in this movie. He really showed his versatility with his<br />acting in this movie. I was really impressed. I was just sad to see him in such a flop of a movie. I hope that he can make a comeback at some point.<br />I think because of the plot (Perhaps because of the director)<br />the other actors are never really allowed to shine. Compare<br />Leonardo DiCaprios performance in this with his performance in<br />Catch Me if you can. He has a similar amount of screen time in<br />each but Catch me has alot more pathos and character development<br />in the writing. The acting is this movie is so bad because the<br />writing is so bad. These are great actors The writing has no sense of pace, no good development aspects. Take away the violence and it is really kind of booring. Notice the number<br />of writers on it by the way. Which is a shame because it was kind of a cool historical time to borrow from. I think this is my last Scorsese movie for a while. He really does seem to be getting worse...
B000089RVX|4.0|After hearing &quot;Bring me to Life&quot; from a trailer off of Daredevil, I instantly fell in love with it.  A few weeks later I went and purchased the CD, and most of the tracks were actually not all that bad.  Most of the songs on the album are awsome, but then after a while some of the songs do get tiresome.  Here's my run down.<br />Going Under :: 5/5 - The beat and the vocals in the song are great!  They have an orginal feel to them.<BR>Bring me to Life :: 5/5 - Their first single which got them most of their recognition.<BR>Everybody's Fool :: 4/5 - This song features more of the band, but is repetitive.<BR>My Immortal :: 5/5 - This song features Amy, the lead singer, singing along with a piano solo.<BR>Haunted :: 3.5/5 - This song wasn't really didn't hit it off for me.<BR>Tourniquet ::3.5/5 - This song wasn't really didn't hit it off for me.<BR>Imaginary &amp; Taking me Over :: 4.5/5 - Both these songs kind off tie into each other very well to bring a original sound to the album.<BR>Hello :: 5/5 - Amy's second solo on the album once again showing off her amazing voice.<BR>My last Breath :: 4.5/5 - This song is pretty decent, it doesn't really stand out before any other song on the record.<BR>Whipser :: 3.5/5 - this song was pretty average, once again doesn't really stand out above another song.<br />The album is awsome and highly recommend it ... probably the one of the best albums this summer.
B00008PX8P|5.0|When this first came out, I wanted it so bad, since the other Zeppelin DVD, The Song Remains the Same, was OK, but left me wanting more. So I bought this last week, and when I first stuck it in my DVD player, I was blown away. It starts with the Royal Albert Hall concert from 1970, which is nothing short of amazing. It contains more stuff from their first album than many of their later concerts (which seem to only play Dazed and Confused). The next DVD contains four songs from The Song Remains the Same. The Black Dog on here is much better than the one on TSRTS because the version on TSRTS was mostly cut. I wish they would have included Heartbreaker, which was on the film but was pretty much butchered, and Celebration Day, which was not on the film but was on the CD soundtrack. The deleted songs Misty Mountain Hop and The Ocean are spectacular live tracks and should have been on the movie. Also include on the second DVD are the Earl's Court and Knebworth concerts (from 1975 and 1979, respectivley) and a Super 8 footage for Immigrant Song from a 1972 concert. Extras include interviews, a New York City Press Conference and more rare live performances. Another song they should have included is Ten Years Gone from the Knebworth show. I know it was played because I have seen it on VH1 Classic. Anyway, It's a wonderful DVD that should be in any Zeppelin fan's DVD library and almost makes me forget that TSRTS was ever made, almost.
B00000J6AG|5.0|I had never heard of this person before until a friend of mine came for a visit from California and popped this in. I had to have my own copy of it. The song, track 3, &quot;porcelain&quot; is completely spell binding. I live on and island and this gets my vote for some of the best beach music yet played on my boardwalk. I honestly don't even know how to describe this stuff expect to say that you're gonna love it. Haunting.
B00009MGQL|4.0|There is some really stellar guitar riffs over the top of the somewhat repetitive tape loops.  This has been Jeff's main modus since the release of Flash some 20 years ago.  A number of reviewers are still looking for a return to Blow by Blow and Wired.  I hope not!  As great as they were, they sound VERY dated.  If you like lots of slide, this is the record for you.

B00008IAMD|5.0|Wonderful and powerful album.  I saw the video for &quot;Hurt&quot; before I bought the cd (which contains the video).  It is quite possibly one of the most moving pieces of art that I have seen.  In 4 1/2 minutes, you span the career of a legend, which includes his greatest triumphs and his deepest &quot;hurts&quot;.   Many thanks to Reznor for writing the song and the director who captures the beauty of a life spent bringing unique satisfaction to the fans.  You will be missed, but you left your gift behind....and music such as this, like you Mr. Cash, only gets better with age.  Thanks again.
B000060P79|4.0|This is a good CD that I listen to alot. If your a fan of Good Charlotte or New Found Glory then you'll like this CD alot. &quot;I'd Do Anything&quot; is the first track which is played on the radio alot, its a pretty good song (not the best) and Mark Hoppus from Blink-182 does backround vocals for this song. &quot;You Don't Mean Anything&quot; comes shortly after and this is probably my favorite song on the CD. The pace is very fast in this song and Joel Madden from Good Charlotte does backround vocals in this song, plus the guitar riffs are awesome. &quot;I'm Just a Kid&quot; is a good track too, although it has a slower pace the lyrics are good and the chorus is very catchy. Other notable tracks are &quot;My Alien&quot; in which Simple Plan's lead singer talks about his fantasies with an alien girlfriend, pretty funny. Also, the powerful guitar riffs and pretty funny lyrics in &quot;God Must Hate Me&quot; make it worth listening to alone. At the end of the CD theres &quot;Perfect&quot; which is an anthem for kids who don't want to be exactly what their parents want them to be and their basically saying to their parents that they can't be perfect. Its a good, slow song that has alot of meaning, one of the best songs on the CD. The two bonus tracks, &quot;Grow Up&quot; and &quot;Christmas&quot; put SP in the place of little kids, and some of the lyrics in these songs are funny. Some of the tracks on the CD are a little weak, but none of them are horrible, making this CD worth buying. It also contains bonus movies and features when you put the CD in your computer.
1577311523|5.0|I generally don't like &quot;spiritual&quot; books because they are often too sacharine, insipid, or sanctimonious.  This work by Eckhart Tolle is an exception.  He seems to have understood the message of the Buddha and has a facility with words that makes his meaning clear in this modern age.  There is much insight and wisdom contained in these pages.  Tolle has experienced the human condition and sees it with a spirtual, mostly Buddhist, perspective.  Since I happen to share much of Tolle's worldview, I really appreciate his ability to convey spiritual ideas in simple English.  This book appears to be the genuine article -- a spiritual treatise by an honest spiritual teacher (though I am put off by how commercial the Tolle enterprise has become with its Tolle 2004 wall calendar and its Tolle deck of spiritual cards, etc.).  Despite the commercialism, Eckhart Tolle has much of value to share.  Highly recommended.
B00005JLSE|4.0|I'd seen the play in New York (with Bebe Neuwirth as Velma) and just loved it.  When I go to movies/theater, I want to be entertained.  No more, no less, and Chicago does just that.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is terrific as Velma, and Renee Zellweger is far better than I'd ever expected as Roxie.  I'd been worried that Rob Marshall would not do a good job in translating the play to the screen, but he did a very creditable job.  What worried me most is the placement of the song-and-dance numbers.  I normally hate it when songs just appear out of nowhere, but Marshall is very clever in the way he manages to insert the songs into the movie, and he deserves all the praise he got.

B00009APK1|5.0|Being a movie fan who has never read any of the Lord of the Rings books, I was a bit skeptical about whether or not I would like this movie or not. I had seen the first movie and liked it fairly well, but I was not prepared for the incredible movie experience of The Two Towers.<br />As many mid-trilogy films are, this movie is darker than the first and probably the next movie. All hope seems lost as the fellowship of the ring is broken up and travels separately. If you have not read the books, it may surprise you that Frodo is not in nearly as much of this movie as he was in the last, because the movie follows each of the broken up groups of the fellowship of the ring.<br />From what I heard, I expected the movie to be almost constant fighting and battle scenes that would get old after awhile. While there are plenty of thrilling fighting scenes, there is also plenty of deep character development, especially since all the characters have already been introduced in the first movie. There are plenty of special effects, such as Smeagle/Gollum and the epic battle scenes, but they are blended into the movie and advance the story; they don't create a sense of showing off like many over hyped movies seem to do.<br />[possible spoilers here]<br />Ian McKellan returns as Gandalf, and his acting is superb as usual. Elijah Wood as Frodo is excellent as well; however, as I mentioned before, he is not in the movie as much as in the last one. He portrays Frodo quite well, as Frodo has grown to appreciate the Ring more and more and begins to act kind of eerie or creepy. The other two hobbits, Pippin and Merry, play a more important part in this film. And of course, there is Gollum, who is completely computer generated character, but is not reminiscent of the dreadful Jar Jar Binks in The Phantom Menace.<br />In conclusion, I think that anyone who has either read Tolkien's books or just likes action, adventure, or fantasy stories would very much like this movie. It very likely may be the greatest film of the year and has been called the &quot;Star Wars&quot; of this generation.

B00007ELEL|2.0|The monotone narration at the start of the film bored me, dude. The film wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either, and watching the teaser trailer made me think it was going to be another Kingpin, man. I wasn't wrong, but thankfully, it didn't focus that much on the bowling, dude. This film is a tad off the wall, man. The words \\"dude\\" and \\"man\\" are littered amongst the dialogue, you try to block it out, but they seem to emphasis the words each time they say it, dude. Seems to have a few reasonably \\"big\\" names, including John Goodman, Jeff Bridges, Steve Buscemi, Julianne Moore and Tara Reid, but it doesn't seem appear to have that big a budget, man.<br />Jeff Bridges looks older and slightly greyer than the only other role I've seen him in, `Starman', dude. Steve Buscemi plays a quiet character: he gets ignored, he doesn't know what John Goodman is talking about most of the time and subsequently gets told to shut up, man. The classic line \\"dude where's my car\\" is uttered so obviously whoever made that, was watching this, dude. Julianne Moore's non-geographical accent gets on my nerves, and she just has to appear naked, man.<br />The phone seems to constantly ring in this, particularly in the first half, for no apparent reason, and no one seems to answer it - just there to get on the viewer's nerves, dude.<br />The scene with the naked chick being thrown up and down accompanied by high-pitched music - what exactly was all that about, man? A scene for the guys and what do the girls get, dude? John Goodman's stomach, man.<br />I laughed a couple of times, but the best bit was when John Goodman throws a bowling ball into the bad guy's nether regions, dude.<br />Judging by the ending, they must have run out of storyline, or money, man. Also, according to the back of this DVD, it was 98 minutes long, but its 116 minutes, and is listed as 127 minutes in a movie book, dude.<br />This film is a meandering series of events, vaguely connected, with no real ending, man. You definitely have to be stoned or drunk to watch this, and I was neither, dude.<br />Extras include a good teaser trailer; a very boring making of; and cast and filmmakers biogs, man.tely have to be stoned or drunk to watch this, and I was neither, dude.<br />Extras include a good teaser trailer; a very boring making of; and cast and filmmakers biogs, man.
0670032506|5.0|Let me start by admitting that while I'm a huge fan of David Allen and his wonderful productivity theories and practices, I found his first book &quot;Getting Things Done&quot; a rather tough read.  A lot of great info was certainly there, but somehow the way it was written left my head spinning. Eventually I began to understand the systems and implement them, but I couldn't get over the nagging feeling that these theories and practices that were so basic and logical did not have to be so hard to grasp.<br />All of these shortcomings have been fixed in this great new book.  Allen's theories, practices and strategies are delivered in 2-5 page bite sized pieces which much better suit his writing style. Each of the 52 short chapters can be devoured in a few minutes and can be understood and internalized individually or in well organized clusters as fits you best.<br />In a perfect world I'd suggest skimming Allen's first book so that you get an over view of his &quot;systems&quot;; then read this book for a bunch of &quot;I get it!&quot; moments; and then back to &quot;Getting Things Done&quot; for a more careful read.  In fact, that's what I'm going to do.  <br />But even if you never read Allen's first book; this new one is well worth the time because it will force you to look at work, time, and all of the stuff that clutters your mind and life in entirely new ways.

B000002H5I|5.0|This album is an essential recording in any collection, not matter what type of music you like. Tracy Chaoman's smooth vocals on a heart wrenching album with take you on an emotional journey only a few other artists (like Jeff Buckley) will take you on. My favourite effort here is Behind the the wall. A song that has no music and only tracy's voice, utterly spine-chillingly captivating. The album showcases what true talent can do on a debut album. Go get yourself a copy, it will be worth whatever you pay for it.
B000024D4R|5.0|Animals, as many other people have said in their reviews, is terribly underrated as an album.  Containing many long tracks, Animals is an album focused on current events at the time of its release.  The album contained lyrics that compared animals, such as sheep and pigs, to humans.  Animals portrays humans as capitalistic and greedy.  Roger Waters wrote the majority of this record.    \\"Pigs on the Wing (Parts 1 and 2)\\" is sung by Roger Waters.  It is a very nice song.  \\"Dogs\\", which is my favourite song on Animals, and one of my favourite all-time Floyd songs, features great guitar riffs, chords, solos, and melodies by David Gilmour.  \\"Dogs\\" is 17 minutes of great music, with Gilmour taking the lead vocals for the majority of the song.  Special keyboarding is done in \\"Dogs\\" by Rick Wright, who does some more outer-space keyboard sounds.  I have to say this again: David Gilmour's guitar is just too good throughout Animals and especially \\"Dogs\\".  \\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\" is phenomenal, with wierd, grim noises but cool sound effects.  It's a great 11 minute and a half song that ends with (once again) a sweet David guitar solo.  \\"Sheep\\", a 10 minute and a half song, is another AWESOME song with, once again, great guitar throughout.  Maybe the best guitar riff ever at the end of the song.  \\"Pigs on the Wing (Part 2)\\" nicely finishes off a spectacular album.    I gave Animals 5 stars.  It should be recognised as a major Floyd album, in my mind, and is extremely underrated and overlooked.

0375823360|5.0|I was recommended this series by a teacher of mine. I was hesitant to read it beucuase the summary on the back was misleading but i decided that i would give it a try and im glad i did.<BR>Telling an excellent fantasy through the eyes of two teenagers is great when a teenager wants to read it. <BR>Phillip pullman has in his books new kinds of fantasy like for example their animal companions. He tells it in such a good way that no one will ever be able to copy it.<BR>All im trying to say is that if you need a new book to read (and i know i say this on most of my reviews) then pick this up!

B00005JKJA|4.0|Yes, this is a wonderous and complex movie.  No, it's not easy to understand and I wouldn't recommend it for &quot;everyday&quot; viewing, since it can be a bit depressing. <br />I was thoroughly, ahem, upset when I discovered that the entire movie is one big chapter on the DVD edition.  Now, one of the main benefits of dvds; aside from the enhanced audio/visual, is the ability to go to a portion of the movie at the click of a button.  Though I find it hard to imagine chapters titled &quot;Blue Key on Table&quot; or &quot;Money in the Bag,&quot; I don't think this movie is *above* something practical like creating some sort of chapter division.<br />My main complaint with this? If I accidentally hit the chapter button on my remote I gotta fast forward through the movie to get to the spot I was at. This gets very annoying if it happens more than once.<br />Anyway, the DVD is still the only format I'd buy, just to thoroughly enjoy the music.  Of course, you could buy the soundtrack for that. And you know what? I bet the soundtrack has &quot;chapters.&quot;
B00009TB5G|5.0|Being a movie fan who has never read any of the Lord of the Rings books, I was a bit skeptical about whether or not I would like this movie or not. I had seen the first movie and liked it fairly well, but I was not prepared for the incredible movie experience of The Two Towers.<br />As many mid-trilogy films are, this movie is darker than the first and probably the next movie. All hope seems lost as the fellowship of the ring is broken up and travels separately. If you have not read the books, it may surprise you that Frodo is not in nearly as much of this movie as he was in the last, because the movie follows each of the broken up groups of the fellowship of the ring.<br />From what I heard, I expected the movie to be almost constant fighting and battle scenes that would get old after awhile. While there are plenty of thrilling fighting scenes, there is also plenty of deep character development, especially since all the characters have already been introduced in the first movie. There are plenty of special effects, such as Smeagle/Gollum and the epic battle scenes, but they are blended into the movie and advance the story; they don't create a sense of showing off like many over hyped movies seem to do.<br />[possible spoilers here]<br />Ian McKellan returns as Gandalf, and his acting is superb as usual. Elijah Wood as Frodo is excellent as well; however, as I mentioned before, he is not in the movie as much as in the last one. He portrays Frodo quite well, as Frodo has grown to appreciate the Ring more and more and begins to act kind of eerie or creepy. The other two hobbits, Pippin and Merry, play a more important part in this film. And of course, there is Gollum, who is completely computer generated character, but is not reminiscent of the dreadful Jar Jar Binks in The Phantom Menace.<br />In conclusion, I think that anyone who has either read Tolkien's books or just likes action, adventure, or fantasy stories would very much like this movie. It very likely may be the greatest film of the year and has been called the \\"Star Wars\\" of this generation. Peter Jackson's second Lord of the Rings movie is an excellent show and a movie that will be famous years from now.e the greatest film of the year and has been called the \\"Star Wars\\" of this generation.

B000066HI4|4.0|not a perfect 10.0 like pitchfork says, but still good.
B00005JLWN|5.0|If for no other reason, get this movie for the fight scenes and gun battles.  Simply amazing.
B00003RQNJ|5.0|A great movie, a great western and the inspiration for a variety of buddy films since this one aired in 1969.  Wonderfully choreographed and set, including the excellent sepia effect used throughout the film with still photography as well as the general film appearance.  The finale is especially enhanced by this effect and leaves the viewer wondering whether Butch and the Kid escaped and returned home or not.<br />The story is known by virtually everyone so I won't repeat it here.  Newman and Redford are absolutely masterful in their roles as Butch and Sundance with Kathryn Ross supporting nicely as Etta Place.  Strother Martin is as scene-stealer as an American expatriate who runs a mine in Bolivia.  He's colorful! Bingo!<br />The DVD is wonderful, including several special features that are as interesting as the film itself.  The &quot;making of...&quot; segment includes interviews with the main actors from the early nineties.  It's impressive to see Newman, Redford and Ross speaking about what has become a timeless western masterpiece.<br />Douglas McAllister
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Wow.  What else can you say about the final work of this music legend?  This album does not have one weak point.  It's almost like a narrative of the thoughts that must have gone through Cash's mind in his final days.  Most listeners have now heard &quot;Hurt&quot; (sure to become a classic), in which he reflects on his own aging process and what he's left behind.  But almost never mentioned is the last song, &quot;We'll Meet Again&quot; which is especially poignant now that Johnny is no longer with us.  It's an &quot;upbeat&quot; way to end such an album, and it makes his death a little easier for us to bear.
0393317552|2.0|While this is an interesting book - it has no end.  It is as though the writer was afraid to offend anyone and, while interesting points are made about civilizations and accessibility, it failed to state with any opinion how this reflects on modern society(ies).  As race and cultural clashes our a part of everyday life, it would have been far more interesting to bring this research forward to a useful conclusion.
B000002UD7|4.0|The global success of PSB's 1986 debut &quot;Please,&quot; was well earned, but let's be honest-- it also put the boys' future in a vulnerable situation.  A hugely successful debut album can sometimes spell instant death for a new act, and their landmark novelty single &quot;West End Girls&quot; had &quot;One Hit Wonder&quot; written all over it.  Amazingly, they beat the sophomore jinx when they released their followup album the next year: &quot;Actually.&quot;  The results?  More hits and more sales.  But even more important, is that &quot;Actually&quot; represents a wise step forward for Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe, who take some smart risks this time around.  Themes of Catholic guilt (&quot;It's a Sin), consumerism (&quot;Shopping&quot;), Thatcherism (&quot;King's Cross&quot;), and infatuation (&quot;Heart&quot;) pop up throughout the album.  However, &quot;Actually&quot; is also remembered as the album that revived the career of the late Dusty Springfield, who duets with the Boys on the still timeless &quot;What Have I Done To Deserve This?&quot;  (That single began a working relationship with Springfield, who moved on to record other PSB originals such as the hits &quot;In Private&quot; and &quot;Nothing Has Been Proved.&quot;) This album was greeted with little critical acclaim in America upon release (check out the original reviews in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;People&quot; if you don't believe me), but over the years it's been revisited by many fans who now consider it a favorite.  You can certainly consider me among those people.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|Great concert movie/documentary from one of the world's best rock and roll bands of all time...<br />Could have been even better if they included a mention or performance from one of their top albums, Quadrophenia.<br />TKAA is a must see video for Who and classic rock and roll fans.

B00008YLV2|5.0|Black Hawk Down, directed by Ridley Scott, produced by The Master of Action & Special Effects Jerry Bruckheimer (Top Gun, Con Air, The Rock) and Winner of 2 Academy Awards is not only the best war movie ever, but also probably the most accurate \\"Based on an Actual Event\\" movie so far. <BR>Somalia (East Africa), 1992. <BR>Years of warfare among rival clans causes famine on a biblical scale. 300,000 civilians die of starvation. Mohamed Farah Aidid, the most powerful of the warlords, rules the capital of Mogadishu. He seizes international food shipments at the ports. Hunger is his weapon. <BR>The world responds. Behind a force of 20,000 U.S. Marines, food is delivered and order is restored. <BR>April 1993. <BR>Aidid waits until the Marines withdraw, and then declares war on the remaining U.N. peacekeepers. In June Aidid's militia ambush and slaughter 24 Pakistani soldiers, and begin targeting American personnel. In late August, America's elite soldiers, Delta Force, Army Rangers, and the 160th SOAR are sent to Mogadishu to remove Aidid and restore order. The mission was to take 3 weeks, but 6 weeks later Washington was growing impatient. <BR>Sunday, October 3rd 1993. <BR>After the American military receive an anonymous intell that some of Aidid's top officials and likely Aidid himself, are to have a meeting in a specific building in Mogadishu, the Delta Force and the Rangers are immediately ordered to prepare for a mission to take over the location and arrest the individuals. Several UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters are sent out to drop-off the soldiers with Delta Force executing the take-over of the building and the Rangers covering the perimeter. The Black Hawks are then to provide a cover from above while on-the-ground Humvee convoy is to pick-up the prisoners and extract the unit. The whole mission is to take no longer than 30 minutes. Everything goes according to plans until 2 of the Black Hawks are shot down and the Rangers and Delta head out to rescue the downed pilots. Surrounded by armed civilians, including women and children, and thousands of heavily-armed Somali militia, the soldiers quickly find themselves outnumbered and outgunned in a city gone mad. <BR>The mission that was to last no longer than 30 minutes, turned into a 16 hour life and death battle. The biggest and bloodiest battle since Vietnam. 19 American soldiers and over 1000 Somalis lost their lives. <BR>A true story re-created by an outstanding director, producer, and cast, Black Hawk Down is an extremely accurate and dramatic masterpiece, portraying the unbelievable courage and determination of the American soldiers and the sad but true inhumanity that takes place during times of war. LEAVE NO MAN BEHIND!
0140120416|5.0|This is the revised edition of an earlier Penguin Russian coursebook available many years ago.  I haven't seen that text, but this book is the best self study stand alone text for any language that I have seen.  I wish Penguin had the same type of book for German.<br />The book progresses in a very sensible way, all of the things you learn are in an order that builds a very solid foundation before moving on to the next lesson.  At times you will run into areas where the author offers &quot;extras&quot; that he says can be skipped.  My advice is don't.  In the first few chapters the &quot;extras&quot; are pages explaining the correct way to pronounce words.  He claims that you'll be understood if you pronounce the words phonetically as they're written, but why not take the little extra time and get it right?  There's also great information on Russian handwriting, some cultural info (very brief), but the book is all business.<br />One thing that it lacks is a way to hear native speakers, of course.  While it goes a long way trying to explain how Russian is spoken, you won't be able to avoid tapes or some other method of actually hearing the language properly spoken.  One inexpensive way would be Barron's Pronounce it Perfectly in Russian.  The best way would be to purchase the Pimsleur lessons, but they're prohibitively expensive for most people. <br />This book is a great foundation for learning Russian.  It's a bargain.  I also recommend another book by the author, the &quot;Russian Learners' Dictionary&quot;, especially along with the Vis-ed Russian flashcards.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|The lyrics on this album are Maiden's best ever, and the music is just as good as anything that they did in the past.  Steve Harris's &quot;No More Lies&quot; is the only song that I didn't like on the first listen, but it's growing on me.<br />Don't get lost in the past.  Unless you are only a &quot;Greatest Hits Only&quot; fan, buy this CD.  You will not be disappointed.
0767817478|1.0|Okay.  What has gone wrong here?  Everything has.  Everything is wrong about this moive to Siskel and Ebert as the mayors of New York City to that idiotic thing about the rain.  This is NOT Godzilla.  In other Godzilla movies, we don't see it rain and rain and rain and rain and rain and rain and....well, you get the idea.  Did I mention the rain?  Good.  And what about that subplot, eh? Could it be more annoying?  What? You say it can? Oh yeah...I guess the French secret service is more annoying than the &quot;long-lost love&quot; garbage.  All in all, I would've enjoyed being eaten by Godzilla then by watching this movie.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|Ok im not a stupid person because I understood this film very well I even liked the original Matrix, but reloaded is a poor excuse for a sequel. The acting is poor, the dialogue is laughable, and the only good scene in the movie is the highway scene. The fight between neo and the smiths looked really bad and fake, but even though i didn't like this movies I am still gonna go see revolutions, because I liked the original Matrix and im hoping that revolutions will not be like reloaded.
B00000I2UC|5.0|Some call it sell-out! How? Did we expect all JAMC albums to sound like &quot;psychocandy&quot;? I think not. They moved on, evolved, and produced a masterpiece. Of course, not all will agree, but this is their best &quot;rock&quot; album, for sure. The feedback is gone and that good for this type of music they were making at the time (1989). &quot;Honey's dead&quot; came close but this is the best place to start if you're a newcomer.
B000000ORX|5.0|Night Ride Home was really a return for Joni Mitchell. She dropped almost all of the instruments that made her records released in the 80's sound so overproduced. There are more acoustic tracks who focus on Joni and her guitar. The lyrics are again from a very high level, like her albums from the 70's. Joni's voice has matured incredible and now you can hear that because of the sparse instrumentation. But that's not a complaint, because her voice sounds very cool and experienced by now. Absolute highlight of this album is Come In From The Cold, a song were Joni is looking back from the first time that she falls in love, to all the romance and relationships that have happened in her life. This is a great work from Joni Mitchell and if you love her more famous albums, you're gonna love this one also.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|This is a classic album, probably the last great album of the 70's. The Clash are 10 times better than any other punk band I know, and that includes Sex Pistols and The Ramones. <br />The album is incredibaly diverse. Hard Rock, 40's pop, rockabilly, reggae, and of course, punk fill out the 19 songs on this album. And none of the songs suck at all. It might be a bit too much to take in all 19 songs at once, but there will be 4-5 songs you'll love.<br />My favorites are London Calling. I think it's a perfect example of originality. Hard Rock mixed with reggae guitar playing. Strange.<br />Also, there's Brand New Cadillac. Just a plain out rock song, with one of the best riffs of all time.<br />Lost In The Supermarket is my all-time favorite Clash song. It has pretty emotional lyrics, but the music is pure Clash.<br />And the best punk songs, Hateful and Koka Kola. These are prime examples of true punk.<br />I'm missing a lot of great songs, but you'll need to hear them for yourself. This is really worthy of 5 stars.
B00008EY9G|4.0|&quot;Identity&quot; is a well-constructed thriller about ten adults (plus a young boy) who are stranded together at a creepy motel in the Nevada desert during a seemingly endless rainstorm.  I won't go into plot details, because numerous others have already done so.  While the movie owes a lot to previous entries in the mystery-thriller genre, it is still quite effective.  It keeps you guessing until about 15-20 minutes from the end and there are more than a few scares along the way.  Not one of the great ones, but well worth watching at least once ... maybe twice.
0375823360|4.0|There are many books in the world which are profoundly disrespectful of other people's dearly held points of view, but that doesn't make them any less valuable or worthwhile - even parts of the Bible come into this category.  The complaint here seems to be the conscious direction of this \\"subversive\\" material at impressionable teenaged minds.<br />Well, a liberal education will tell you that Christian teaching might be seen in certain quarters as similarly subversive (for example, to people who aren't Christian), but you don't hear too many people calling for PG ratings to be slapped on the Good Book.<br />The point is that this is clearly a work of fantasy fiction: sure, it borrows from Christian fable, but by the same token it heavily modifies it. Several of the events upon which Pullman invites the reader's ethical judgment do not (to my knowledge) appear anywhere in actual Christian legend. Pullman made them up, so as slings and arrows against the real religion (which I don't believe Pullman intends them to be), they have no force at all.<br />To the extent this trilogy counsels young adults to question the world view they get from organised religion - this is, I suspect, what really sticks in the craw - it seems to me to be a wholly worthwhile enterprise. I gather Pullman is not religious, but His Dark Materials is obviously informed by Blake and Milton, and fondly so, and I didn't find this an especially anti-Christian read (then again, I read as someone who is culturally but not intellectually Christian, so am probably less inclined than some to take offence)<br />As for the content of the story, I think comparisons with Harry Potter are unfair; it's much better than that: His Dark Materials deserves to be held up against CS Lewis and JRR Tolkien; the best JK Rowling can say is that, with The Goblet of Fire and The Order Of The Phoenix, she's catching up - but as yet she has a lot of development as a writer to do.<br />What's so nice about His Dark Materials is how imaginative it all is. Whereas Harry Potter, from Hogwarts down, is wholly derivative, Pullman treats us to new ideas: the daemon is a classic example. And his characterisations are rich indeed: Lyra is a delightfully sketched snotty-nosed urchin; Mrs Coulter is no ham-fisted villain, but a sophisticated, deceitful, agenda-pursuing adversary.<br />I think the story gets the better of Pullman as he goes on: Northern Lights is a fairly tightly constructed tale; the Subtle Knife introduces more characters (and ditches one or two) and becomes a bit more of a yarn; by the time The Amber Spyglass is into full swing you're into a fullblown shaggy-dog story with so many different plot strands it's difficult to keep up with who's doing what to whom and why, especially as many of the characters are quite duplicitous anyway.<br />As a result, it is impossible to cleanly tie all the plot lines up and, in the same way that Tolkien was, Pullman is obliged to provide a number of false summits before we reach the final conclusion, and when it arrives it is a little bit of a let down.<br />The baroqueness of the plot is a flaw, but there's no denying that this is a really classy, challenging, provocative tale even for us adults.is how imaginative it all is.

B00005JLZN|4.0|The Life of David Gale continues an honourable tradition of death row weepies, but manages, in a way that Dead Men Walking didn't, to stay the right side of the sanctimonium line.<br />I have seen a review elsewhere criticise the film for making both sides of the death penalty debate look venal and stupid, but that's exactly what I liked about it - do-gooders don't, after all, have a monopoly on common sense (nor even, in my experience, much of a grip on it at all).<br />Instead of getting high and mighty, Parker chooses to look at the particular case of a death row activist who himself winds up facing the chair, thus substituting irony - and at the ... er, death, irony *upon* irony - for self-righteousness as the driver of the film. To say any more would give too much away, but I wound up enjoying this movie, despite a very ordinary first twenty minutes.<br />To my horror, I subsequently discovered the movie had been almost universally panned by the critics as shallow, formulaic and manipulative: perhaps I have been manipulated by the formula (I concede that at times I am a little shallow), but I stand by my judgment.<br />In small ways, the movie is definitely clumsy, and it certainly wouldn't merit inclusion in any cinematic hall of fame. The opening scenarios - at Gale's university and Bitsey Bloom's newdesk (Bitsey Bloom - what kind of a name is that?), prior to the events of the film - are poorly scripted and acted, and throughout the rest of the film there is some very obvious, clich?d religious imagery - Gale lies on a lawn as if crucified, and swings from a tree as if he were Judas (or should this be St. Jude the patron saint of lost causes?) - but this doesn't really detract from the overall impression of a well constructed, effective movie.<br />And it has a cracker of a finale. Flip the bird to the critics, then. I liked it. (...)
B000002H97|4.0|The answer: NO. However, it is still a teriffic album. But there is one thing I don't get: WHY THE F@*! DID EVERYONE RAISE A STINK ABOUT &quot;NOTHING ELSE MATTERS&quot;?! IT MAY NOT BE THE SOUND THAT YOU'RE USED TO, BUT IT'S STILL A GREAT SONG. So Metallica did a power ballad- who cares? Lots of metal bands do power ballads. But, anyway, back to the first subject, I expected Ride The Lightning to be on ultimate albums- it's definetely their best work. Then again, this album is a much higher seller, and also had more mainstream success. Great, just not ultimate.
0385504209|1.0|I can't believe I even wasted my time with this book.  To be fair, the writing was serviceable and the plot was &quot;unusual&quot;.  The sheer absurdity of the plot and ignorance of Western history, however, was impossible to get through.  I suppose that's half the fun for those who enjoyed the book, but there are an alarming number of people who seem to believe the veracity of the author's &quot;research&quot;.  What Mr. Brown really does is &quot;cite&quot; a bunch of ridiculous cult anti-histories that prefer paranoia and cover-ups to verifiable historical fact.  Two examples:<br />1.  The description of Gothic cathedrals as having &quot;a...long hollow nave as a secret tribute to a woman's womb&quot;, serving as a tribute to the &quot;goddess&quot;.  The reality is verifiable through any book on the history of architecture.  The cathedral is actually a logical progression from Roman public buildings, which included naves, and had nothing to do with the worship of a &quot;goddess&quot;, emperor worship being the official and chief Roman religion.<br />2. Brown claims that the tetragrammaton YHWH derives from &quot;Jehovah, an androgynous physical union between the mascualine Jah and the pe-Hebraic name for Eve, Havah&quot;, as a means of supporting his notion that Jews secretly worshipped a feminine counterpart to the male deity through prostitutes in the Temple.  In reality, Jehovah was a 16th Century creation, the name of God as found by combining the vowels of the Hebrew word for God (Adonai).<br />As a work of fiction The Da Vinci Code is passable entertainment.  The sheer effort required to ignore the numerous re-inventions of history and suspend disbelief in the face of such implausable conspiracies, however, make reading it a chore for anyone who is even moderately educated about any of the issues it touches on.
B00003CXDV|5.0|I've never really been a fan of Tim Allen or Sigourney Weaver, so I put off watching this movie for a good while.  I kept hearing and reading about how funny it was, though, so I finally gave in and watched it.  The stories I heard are true because this is really an excellent comedy.  I myself have some natural tendencies toward the type of TV show fans being lampooned in jest here, but we geeks have an amazing quality of laughing at ourselves when what we are seeing is genuinely funny.  The idea is actually just short of brilliant; take the cast of a Star Trek-like science-fiction show cancelled twenty years ago and put them in a situation wherein they have to become the characters they played in order to save themselves and an entire civilization.  The script is excellent, introducing great characterizations of the characters early on, keeping the action and comedy coming fast and furious, and maintaining the comedy at a witty and fresh level.<br />Tim Allen plays Jason Nesmith who plays Commander Peter Quincy Taggart, an obviously Shatner-inspired character who continues to hog all of the spotlight garnered from the old Galaxy Quest series, not realizing that his fellow cast members hold him in some disdain for his egomaniacal antics.  A surprisingly blonde and very funny Sigourney Weaver plays Gwen DeMarcol who plays Lt. Tawny Madison, and she has always been unhappy about the fact her character on the show was never taken seriously.  Then there is Alan Rickman's character Alexander Dane who plays the reptilian-human Dr. Lazarus; this formerly successful British &quot;real actor&quot; despises his rubber-headed character and constantly laments the depths to which his previously distinguished career has sunk.  The other characters are also great: the fairly weird Fred Kwan (Tony Shalhoub) who plays Tech. Sgt. Chen, former boy actor Tommy Webber (Daryl Mitchell) who plays Lt. Laredo, and even Guy Fleegman (Sam Rockwell), better known as the expendable character whose lack of a last name makes him expect to meet death around every corner.  You absolutely have to love the odd alien Thermians who seek the help of Commander Taggart in a last ditch effort to save their people and culture from a ruthless menace, believing all of the Galaxy Quest shows they intercepted in space to be actual historical documents of the bravest ship's crew to travel the universe.<br />The new adventures of the crew of the NSEA Protector, with the characters pretending to be the heroes they aren't, are rollicking good times interlaced with plenty of comedy and ruminations as to how our heroes ended up in this kind of unbelievable situation.  There are even a couple of poignant moments inserted into the story which complement the comedy quite well and provide further insight into characters who, quite impressively, never really become total parodies of themselves.  The special effects are also excellent, and that is another thing that Galaxy Quest has going for it.  In this type of comedy, the special effects would seem to be of secondary importance, so their impressiveness serves to keep the storyline from sinking into campiness.  Industrial Light and Magic handled all of the space scenes and some of the alien monsters, and the preeminent Stan Winston created some incredible aliens and monsters to fill this outrageous universe.  The DVD only makes a great movie even better, throwing in such extras as an enjoyably informative making-of featurette and a number of deleted scenes.<br />You don't have to be a science-fiction fan to enjoy Galaxy Quest, although it will probably resonate more with those familiar with the Trek-like nature of the subject matter.  Underneath the laughs and thrills hides a decidedly human story that inspires as it entertains, and this kind of quality comedy should be easily recognized and enjoyed by just about everyone.  It would have been so easy to turn this kind of movie into something really silly if not insulting, but Galaxy Quest is nothing short of a brilliantly made comedy.Galaxy Quest is nothing short of a brilliantly made comedy.
0312305060|2.0|No, I didn't like this book at _all_.  I read it back to back with Mrs. Dalloway, so that the original would be fresh in my mind, and the contrast shows just how wanting this new take is.  Plenty of reviewers have summarized the plot, so I'm going to cut to the chase: this book should either have been a lot longer, or a lot shorter.  Dalloway got away with its wisp of a plot because plot wasn't the point, and its couple hundred pages were plenty to explore the richness of the quotidian in fascinating, quiet fashion, a feminine counterpart to Ulysses.  The Hours, on the other hand, interweaves 3 stories in the same space, giving so little time to each that none of the characters acquire real personality or gather even a scrap of sympathy.  Instead we get an intricately plotted (yes, I admit that Cunningham knows how to diagram a plot, but this book is like a soulless machine, and there are more suprises in most rereadings of novels than in the first read here) series of whining and sighing women and men.  Furthermore, there is ZERO variation in writing style, pace, or tone, no humor, and simply nothing to keep one interested: people whine, and then they die and turn out to be related.  To add to the insult, the present-day thread of the story is a pedantic game of &quot;spot the transposition&quot;, as lacking in cleverness as the butchering of Austen's Emma into the movie &quot;Clueless&quot;.<br />Now don't get me wrong, I like daring fictional experiments, as well as more traditional narratives, and if one places great weight in one element of writing--plot, characterization, style, philosophy, a message, even just plain fun--to the detriment of the others, that can be fine, even brilliant, but even the plot, the best element of this, is lukewarm at best.  Dull, faintly depressing, _and_ stupid.  An utter travesty he got the Pulitzer for this tripe.
B00008977N|4.0|I was first introduced to Peter Gabriel's live shows on his 2002/2003 &quot;Growing Up&quot; tour, being too young to have caught him on his previous tours 10 years earlier. His concerts are fantastic, combining art, music, and theatrics (and often acrobatics). &quot;Secret World Live&quot; was his 1994 concert in support of his &quot;Us&quot; album, and is one of the finest concert films ever released. The DVD release is great, save for some technical problems.<br />The highlight of the concert were &quot;Come Talk To Me&quot;, which has Gabriel emerging from a phone booth and he inches towards backing vocalist Paula Cole, &quot;Solsbury Hill&quot; (a classic!), and &quot;Shaking The Tree&quot;. Most, if not all, of the songs are book-ended by African vocals and tribal beats. It is beautiful how they meshed together the songs. With strong musicians (his longtime bassist Tony Levin especially) and backing vocals from Paula Cole (who has had some fleeting success in the mid-90s as a solo artist) and Shankar on violin and vocals makes the sound well rounded and pleasing to the ears. Gabriel himself is always an energetic and spirited presence, dressed like Han Solo and doing his odd dances and mimes throughout the show.<br />While the concert is fantastic, the DVD release has a few problems with the picture and sound. The picture is grainy at times, which would be most noticeable to people with big screen, plasma, or projection television sets. While the DVD boasts &quot;Re-Mixed and Re-Mastered&quot;, but it appears that the source material was a bit frayed. The picture is not horrible, but it could be much better, considering the capabilities of the DVD format. The sound is mostly well mastered, but there are times when the backing vocals are muted, making them almost indistinct. The bass also fades out on occasion, but this is less noticeable and therefore less of an inconvenience. These are not serious problems that would prevent me from recommending the DVD, but DVD purists would definitely find things to complaint about.<br />The supplements are nothing spectacular. There is an insubstantial &quot;Making Of&quot; featurette, which is good for a one-off viewing. There is also a nice promo for Gabriel's &quot;:Growing Up&quot; tour, where he goes into detail about the setup of his new concerts, including the giant hamster bubble that anyone who has seen his recent concerts loves. My favorite supplement, though I don't know why, is the time-lapse of a concert in Berlin, Germany. Over the course if a minute, we see the stages being set up in an empty arena, the full concert, and everything being dismantled, packed up, and shipped out. It is a lot of fun.<br />&quot;Secret World Live&quot; is a fantastic concert film that cannot be ruined, even by a sub-standard video transfer and iffy sound quality. It contains some of his best music during one of his best concerts. Highly recommended.t DVD purists would definitely find things to complaint about. <br />The supplements are nothing spectacular.

B0000BYM3K|5.0|I have been reading the reviews of this album, and for the most part, it seems like TRUE MAIDEN FANS got it right and gave it five stars!<br />Some of the bitching and moaning is unbelievable... <br />- Not being as good as Bruce's solo work?<BR>- Not the Maiden of the past? <BR>- <BR>NO $HIT Sherlock! If you know anything about this band (read their autobiography \\"Run to the Hills\\"), you will know that this band is all about musical progression and growth. Maintain who they are and never sell out, but still grow! Talk about walking the razors edge, that is a tough task for any band but Maiden has pulled it off for the last 20 years!<br />Don't listen to those reviews that give this album 1 or 2 stars. That is $hit. If you are a true fan you will love this album. Great song writing, straight forward heavy metal rock and roll and as always, TRULY MAIDEN!<br />For those of you who want another Number of the Beast, I suggest you keep listening to the same album over and over. Also, keep dinking the same beer, eating the same food, doing the same thing. How f'cking boring.<br />This album is truly great. <br />UP THE IRONS!
B000002B7U|5.0|Released in 1986, \\"The Ultimate Sin\\" was a clear cut success, it went Double Platinum (That's 2 Million copies for those keeping score.) And the Tour played to Packed Venues Nationwide. <br />Ozzy's backing musicians for this album were Ozzy Osbourne - Vocals, Jake E. Lee - Guitars, Phil Soussan - Electric Bass Guitar and Randy Castillo - Drums and Percussion. <br />I consider this line-up to be the strongest of all Ozzy Incarnations. The Late Great Randy Castillo makes his debut behind the Drum Kit, a position he'd helm for about a decade. Jake E. Lee churns out riffs with a fury and passion that was lacking on the previous album, \\"Bark At The Moon\\". Phil Soussan's bass lines are always fluid and intriguing. And Ozzy's voice is still in top form, he can carry a clear melody. Compared to on later efforts his pipes sound deteriorated and past their prime. Maybe that's due to Age or Drugs/Alcohol I'm not sure. Or perhaps a combo of all three. <br />BUT for some odd, unforeseen reason today this album gets a bad reputation, despite the fact it outsold Ozzy's preceding 1983 Album \\"Bark At The Moon\\". And I've wondered for years why is this so? Thanks to sites like Epinions I can let my thoughts be known. <br />Ozzy Osbourne recently released a double Disc \\"Essential\\" compilation which is touted to be the end all thee all Ozzy Offering casual fans will need. NOT SO. The Tracklisting seems fine except one MAJOR, GLARING OMMISION. There was not one song from the Ultimate Sin! Is Ozzy and his label under some Revisionist spell? Have they a bad case of amnesia? What about the Two Hit Singles this album spun off? They are \\"Shot in the Dark\\" and the title track, respectively. The latter had a popular video on MTV. <br />I must completely disagree with another reviewer who said the production is bad. It sounds fine to me! \\"The Ultimate Sin\\" was helmed by Ron Nevison who also produced the Damn Yankees first album. The man has a knack for crispness and clarity. And, as is the casewith many albums he produced, the Drum Sound here is superb. The Snare sounds natural unlike many albums of that time which reverted to a synth/electronic sound. Remember this? Van Halen's \\"5150\\" anyone? <br />I'm a conspiracist at heart, and one reason I believe many fans dislike this album is because of Jake E. Lee. This was his second and final album with the Oz. These same fans never accepted the fact that Ozzy's previous guitarist and Musical soulmate Randy Rhoades died in a plane crash. Subsequently they automatically hated whoever would take his place, no matter how talented that person may be. Which is exactly what happened in Jake E. Lee's case. <br />At the risk of commiting blasphemy I prefer Jake E. Lee over the other guitarists Ozzy hired (Zakk Wylde, Randy Rhoades). Those two can play very fast, but remember speed isn't everything. Yes Jake can pull off Two-Hand tapping techniqes with ease, but he is a very solid rhythm player, a skill the other two lacked in comparision. In fact Jake once said something to the effect of \\"I listen to many guitarists today and their Rhythm playing is Dismal. I wish they'd practice more, too much emphasis is placed on Solos, which is stupid 'cuz 90% of the song you're playing Rhythm.\\" <br />When I was a toddler this album cover used to scare me, but now that I'm older and wiser it looks pretty cool, Ozzy's best actually. <br />BAD NEWS. To cash in on the popularity of The families TV Show \\"The Osbournes\\", his Record Label, Epic has re-issued and re-mastered all albums in The Ozzy catalog...Which Is kinda stupid because they had done an excellent job of re-issuing his back catalog in 1995. <br />But now Epic has re-recorded the Bass and Drum tracks for many of his classic albums because of a senseless dispute over royalties which was brought forth by a lawsuit from the Original musicians. They haven't received sufficient credit either. By the Way the Modern instruments dubbed over a classic recording doesn't work at all.But c'mon, especially today Ozzy and Sharon (His Wife/Manager in case you've lived under a rock and missed the show) should have NO excuse for Paying up. The latest Reissuing of Ozzy's work does not include \\"The Ultimate Sin\\", which is kinda good cuz if it was the Drum and Bass tracks would have been severely altered. But this album is NOW OUT OF PRINT, so you may have to Check the Amazon Used Section to find it. If at all possible, try to pick up the 1995 Remaster, which has \\"Ozzy\\" in big letters running vertically down the right-hand side and a green background. That's the version I'm reviewing right now. The sound quality is noticeably better by way of a 22 Bit Digital Mastering Process. <br />If you're worried that by picking up the 1995 Remaster you wouldn't see the Cover art in all it's glory, it's on the first panel of the Booklet, Which also include Lyrics, extensive Thank-You's and many rare and previously unpublished photos. I always thought Stylistically Ozzy's band were at their best around this time. Mach I of Hair-Metal was in Full Swing, which means Spandex and Teased Hair, if you've read my previous reviews you'll know I'm a huge fan of this era. Ignore the fold-out advertisement for Ozzy Swag, 'Cuz unless you've got a Doc Brown Delorean the stuff's no good, the offer expired on March 31, 1996. <br />When listening to the opening title track you get the impression that Ozzy and his backing band were thugs on a rampage. Heck they probably could've strolled through the 'Hood and stood solid ground. The lyrics are in Sing-a-long form. It begins with Randy bashing away at the toms. My favorite part of the song is after the second verses Jake plays a low-to-high chord effect. <br />\\"Secret Loser\\" is the first uptempo track on the album. It's powered by a Rock Solid Riff, and the solo is Jawdropping! Jake's two-hand tapping may not break any new ground, but he plays the same note repetitively, something scant few others do. The Bass Line is superb, addingflare. <br />\\"Never Know Why\\" moves along at a marching pace, and although the lyrics are a bit simplistic the chorus goes \\"You'll never Know why...We Rock!\\", that doesn't detract from the song. <br />\\"Thank God For The Bomb\\" is a thoughtful anti-nuclear weapons anthem. The crunching guitar lets up a bit while Ozzy sings the verses. Sample Lyrics: \\"War is just another Game/Tailor Made for the Insane/But make a threat of their Annihilation/And nobody wants to play/If that's the only thing that keeps the peace Then Thank God For The Bomb.\\" The song ends with the sound of a bomb exploding. <br />On \\"Never\\" Jake E. Lee plays an Amazing riff that smoothly flows, and The Solo Doesn't disappoint either, as you'll hear high-pitched Finger-Tapping. <br />\\"Lightning Strikes\\" continues the winning streak. The words express Ozzy's devotion to Rock, \\"Until I feel that thunder shattering my Brain/I won't stop Rockin' All night Rockin' All Night/Until the Strikes Again.\\" There's a few moments during this song that are so engaging, if you're not following along will Smack you upside the Head! Right Before the Chorus Prelude there's a Randy Castillo Double Drum Thud/Guitar Crunch\\". In the fading moments Jake sneaks in another brief Guitar Solo! <br />Ozzy Gets Thoughtful again with the ensuing track, \\"Killer Of Giants\\". The starting Chords are played Electrically, and an Acoustic Guitar can soon be heard simultaneously. A slight Keyboard element is also present which only strengthens the effect. When Ozzy Kicks in, you'll witness the deepest words he's ever sung: \\"If none of Us Believe in War/Then can you tell me what the weapons for\\". He sings with such Passion and Emotion...Very Striking. The Verses transition into a Heavier Chorus. And for a little while the Tempo speeds up, then slows back down for the closing chorus. <br />The weakest Track on the album, but by no means a Dud is \\"Fool Like You\\". Phil Soussan plays a solid Bass Line yet again. The Main Riff is a Hook in itselfso to speak, it's very catchy. <br />\\"Shot in the Dark\\" ends the album. In the first 30 Seconds it almost seems like Angels are singing. This song encompasses a Real Moody feel. This was a Huge Hit Back in the Day, but it wasn't included on Ozzy's Recent Double Disc best Of. I'm left scratching my head. For my money I actually prefer the live version of this song from the Moscow Peace Festival because here it sounds Tame in Comparision. But then again all the live cuts of this song are played By Zakk Wylde, NOT It's original Architect Jake E. Lee. So if you're like me and prefer Jake E. Lee you'll be out of luck. That said, the Studio version isn't Terrible I guess. <br />How Could a Double-Platinum album be out-of-print? Well that's the case here with \\"The Ultimate Sin\\". Track down a copy before it's too late.
B000000WFU|5.0|One of the best of my cd collection. And mind you, I own more than 600 cd's in total. I stumbled upon Adiemus while still in my Irish folk/new age/ECM jazz etc. days. This album is comprised of such songs/instrumental tracks which will make you feel as if you're on a journey across oceans, continents, and time. Its an album to hold close to your heart, its filled with emotions and inspire the imagination for those writers/creators among us, and all in all, a great album to pass the time with,  day-dreaming of life and past and future.
B000002B2T|1.0|Not to sound mean or like I am walking on Laynes grave, but this album...is terrible.  It should not have been released, and I am surprised the record company released this boring, depressing work of drivel without taking it to the cutting room floor.<br />From the opening strains of &quot;Wake Up,&quot; to the achingly last song &quot;All Alone,&quot; this album just has no soul.  The only mildly interesting track, and that is a stretch is &quot;River of Deceit.&quot;  I remember purchasing this album a couple of days after it came out in Spring 1995, because I was close to graduating as a senior from high school.  The disappointment I can still picture, after putting this CD in my car and finding it stunk.  I tried to like it, but each time I listened to it, I got more annoyed and finally gave it away to a friend.  There is essentially nothing upbeat on this album, everything is dark and moody, no hard riffs or Chains like singing, just mud, mud, some more mud and terrible vocals.<br />If you are looking for Alice in Chains, Screaming Tree's, some Pearl Jam, than actually purchase albums by those respective bands.  This has nothing do soundwise with those other bands.  Save your money!
6300216403|4.0|The one thing I like about Paper Moon is the cinematography. The scenary is spectacular, and makes you feel like you're in the depression era. Paper Moon is about the adventures of a con artist and his 9 year old cohort played by Tatum O Neal. The girl's mother dies as the result of a car crash, and it's up to the con artist(played by Ryan O Neal) to take care of the girl and to get her to her aunt. Only thing is, is that they quickly find out that they make a great team at conning people. Though whimsical for the most part, the movie also shows what life was like during the depression years. Will he end up taking her to her aunt? Will something tragic happen to part them? Will the owner of Amazon send me KISS Alive IV for Christmas? I won't answer the first two, and I don't know about the third one, but I'm hopeful (smiling)<BR>This movie has a bit of strong language and some racy dialogue, but overall this is a superb film and cool to watch
B000096H33|2.0|another version of Tubular bells - get the original.<BR>DVD is only a cheap computer made video (i can make it myself) and few album tracks to listen in DVD rom.
B00005JM1Y|4.0|Hi,<br />In my opinion you will like this movie if YOU:<br />1. enjoy British humor.<br />2. Enjoy spoofs.<br />3. Are aware of and like, the movies that Austin Powers makes<br />  fun of, because you get more of that here.<br />4. are a fan of the Pink Panther movie series by Blake Edwards<br />5. enjoy sight gags and a good \\"straight man (or woman).\\"<br />6. are a Rowan Atkinson fan already.<br />A lot of things I have read about this movie seem to be stuck on Atkinson's Mr. Bean character.  That is not who we see in this movie.  For one thing, Johnny English speaks and he speaks quite a bit.  Pay attention to what he says too, very funny in context.  I think he is more \\"Inspector Clousea\\" than \\"Mr. Bean\\", an English Inspector Clousea with his own straight man as sidekick with some \\"James Bond\\" gadgets thrown in the mix.<br />I liked the movie and if you are in the mood to giggle, I recommend going to see this movie with someone who \\"gets\\" British humor, or go by yourself, it is great fun even alone.<br />By the way, don't forget to check out PBS for Mr. Bean reruns and (in my area at least) the brand new series of Mr. Bean cartoons!
B0000942HV|2.0|how many times do we hear it? &quot;tubular bells&quot;,&quot;Tubular bells II&quot;,&quot;Tubular Bells III&quot;,&quot;The millenium bell&quot;,&quot;the best of tubular bells&quot;......Man - it is a good music but it gets boring every time when Mike's rides on his legend making another bells...what next - &quot;Tubular bells IV&quot; ???<BR>we don't need another bells - for all of you who wants to buy it - get original &quot;Tubular bells&quot; - it is much more interesting and less synthetic.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|This is my favorite album along with All Eyez on Me and Seal(1994)<BR>1. Affirmation- I will never grow tired of this song<BR>2. Hold Me- very decent<BR>3. I Knew I loved you- This has to be the #1 song played at weddings<BR>4. The Best Thing- Great dance song and very catchy<BR>5. Crash and Burn- First song i heard off of Affirmation and its awsome<BR>6. Chained to you- another great dance song<BR>7. The Animal song- awsome<BR>8. The Lover after me- Perfect song for a break-up<BR>9. Two Beds and a coffee machine- Listen to the lyrics closely itll make you kinda sad<BR>10. You can still be free- Listen to Darren Hayes vocals on this song, this guy does have talent<BR>11. Gunning down romance- very offbeat compared to rest of album but still kicks a$$<BR>12. I dont know you anymore- depressing but good
B00005JKZV|5.0|Wow, this movie is just awesome.  The combat scenes are simply amazing.  I can't wait for the special extended edition.
B00005U8EM|5.0|If you're a Bill Murray or Andie McDowell fan, and you really love this movie, I'd recommend you get this DVD.  However, I was somewhat disappointed in the extras on the DVD.  The commentary is done by Harold Ramis, who, while entertaining, is no Bill Murray.  Neither is Bill anywhere to be seen on the included documentary, &quot;The Weight of Time&quot;.  Nevertheless, I highly recommend the DVD, since this is one of the better movies made in the 90's, and a very re-watchable.
0060926317|1.0|Intellectually, most of the ideas are better presented in Daniel Quinn's \\"Ishmael\\", \\"Story of B\\" and \\"My Ishmael\\". Esoterically, there is nothing new here. The bulk of the \\"inward\\" ideas can be gleaned from any study of Native American spirituality, the rest are lifted for the most part from \\"A Course in Miracles\\" (which is often hijacked by bestselling New Age publishers, but still worth reading in it's original form), with a tip of the hat to Joseph Campbell. From an anthropological standpoint, her references and customs are from a different continent entirely (that is, North America) with only a cursory (and stereotypical) amount of detail about the Australian Aborigines.  I found it interesting that Marianne Williamson is quoted on the cover (author of \\"A Return to Love: Reflections on a Course in Miracles\\"), as she is a partner in crime to the author at the same publisher, Harper Collins. I'm assuming Marianne's quote will help sell her book as well, and they can all share in the spoils. I wonder if the author took her $3,000,000 advance from the publisher and put it to good use protecting and preserving the aboriginal culture she attempts to exploit?<br />To put it back in context, she actually apologized to the Aboriginal tribal elders for the book.  In a comic note, the apology was brokered by the utterly respected spiritual leader and noted Hollywood action star Steven Seagal:<br />....P>Lastly, the \\"official aboriginal source\\" who lends credence to this absurd tale recanted on any approval before his death. After pressure from the Aboriginal tribes the work was labeled \\"fiction\\" by the publisher, although her introduction still claims it's a real work based on her experiences.   I'd give it a D-.  Normally, I'd give it an F, but I'm impressed by her complete lack of conscience in the name of profit. Sorry to rain on the parade, but there are more wholesome and helpful esoteric texts out there...
B000002C1W|5.0|First off, for those of you who don't know, this is the first Pink Floyd album that was done entirely without Roger Waters. Just by listening to the music it is obvious. <br />However, many purists call this &quot;David Gilmour's solo album&quot;, which is of course not true at all. While it may be very different from Roger's self-indulgent &quot;The Final Cut&quot;(which is more of a Waters solo album than this is a Gilmour solo album), it does not jump from one extreme to the other.<br />The album starts with the ambient, relaxed &quot;Signs of Life&quot; and seamlessly leads into the ever popular &quot;Learning to Fly&quot;. <br />The real stand out here is &quot;On The Turning Away&quot;, however. True to the Pink Floyd spirit, it is a beautiful song about social class and how it needs to be reformed. And of course Gilmour offers his legendary guitar skills to the song.<br />&quot;Yet Another Movie&quot; is a also a great song. Very dark and somewhat mysterious, with the ambience that runs freely in the album. <br />&quot;Terminal Frost&quot; is a good instrumental, but it does end up sounding like a collaboration with Kenny G.<br />&quot;Sorrow&quot;, is a very dark song that has pretty good lyrics, considering Roger is gone. It's also a great finisher for the album, though it does get more attention than it deserves.<br />This album isn't all good, though. Here are some of the bad things:<br />With Roger gone, most of the lyrical genius is also gone, and it is very obvious in most songs(with one or two exceptions).<br />Some songs do sound a little too like pop music.<br />Rick Wright didn't contribute to any of the songs, as he joined the band again after most of the recording was aleady done.<br />The bottom line: If you don't have it totally ingrained that Pink Floyd '87 is just a Gilmour solo effort, then this album is a great addition to your collection. It is the third Floyd Album I bought, and believe me, I haven't ever regretted it.
B00005JKHN|4.0|At a hefty cost of six million dollars and six years in production, Walt Disney?s \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" promised to be the most ambitious animated feature ever produced. However, changing public tastes resulted in a majestic glossy-looking effort that, despite its technical innovations, failed to become the blockbuster the studio had hoped for. The story, slightly changed from its Grimm?s fairytale origins, charts the birth of Princess Aurora (vocal by Mary Costa). The young Princess is cursed by the evil Maleficent, a horned sorceress visually realized by animator, Mark Davis, that has to rank among the all time great Disney villainesses. Before her sixteenth birthday, Aurora will prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die. But three good fairies believe otherwise. They usher off the baby Aurora into the woods and raise her as their own.  But Aurora meets up with her future in a big way when she comes across the brooding Prince Philip (vocal by Bill Shirley). He instantly succumbs to her charms, not realizing that she is the princess he is supposed to marry. But when Maleficent discovers their romance, she is determined to see that tomorrow never comes for the couple. The magnificently staged final show down between Prince Philip and Maleficent is chillingly good entertainment on every level and the story is as fresh and appealing to seniors as it is for the young at heart. <BR>\\"Sleeping Beauty\\" was shot in Technirama - a Cinemascope-style 2:35:1 aspect ratio that, in the past, has suffered on 1:33:1 television displays in a cropped off pan and scan image. On disc one of this two disc set we get both the Technirama transfer and a full frame copy ? to satisfy those who have yet to realize that full frame means fifty percent of the image is missing from their television screens. The review herein will concentrate on the widescreen version of the film which, in a word, is beautiful! Colors are rich, vibrant, bold and have been carefully rebalanced to provide a very smooth and crisp looking transfer. Black and contrast levels are fully realized. <BR>A few problems - minor digital noise and a halo effect during portions of the forest sequence that flashes so quickly you almost have to stop and think, \\"Did I just see that?\\" The audio, remixed to 5.1 but strident, strangely lacking in bass - I say, strangely because \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" was recorded in stereo that, while, of course, should sound dated by today's standards, usually has a strong sonic bass characteristic that is curiously absent here. <BR>Extras too are something of a disappointment. We get the \\"Once Upon A Dream\\" featurette - billed as a ?new? documentary on the making of the film. Created for the previously issued laserdisc and VHS copies this featurette is too short - not covering the scope of production. Next, there's the Peter Tchaikovsky Story - a badly acted and largely fictional account of the man who was inspired to write, among other things, the \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" ballet. The transfer here is terribly faded, suffers from chips and scratches and digital noise, edge enhancement and shimmering fine details. We also get the \\"Grand Canyon\\" featurette that accompanied \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" on its original theatrical engagement, but again, as with the Tchaikovsky Story, all the same criteria apply and - this time - the Technirama image HAS NOT BEEN ENHANCED FOR 16:9 TELEVISION DISPLAYS!!! <BR>There's a really, REALLY awful music video, some benign child's play and a few short featurettes that, among other topics, explain how the film was shot, the techniques used in the animation and the restoration process employed for this new DVD. <BR>Over all, I could have done without these studio junkets, especially since none of them were even moderately cleaned up for inclusion into this special edition. Still, for its stunning art of animation and a near pristine anamorphic transfer of the film - once upon a dream no more!
B000084T18|1.0|This cd is not even worth 50 cents because its just like every other trendy and commercial garbage out today.The beats are too simple and the lyrics are full of the same old gangster nonsense.This guy is so over rated and talentless that I cant even begin to descibe.Many of the mindless mtv sheep will be buying this,but if your original and like good music you will skip this trash.DO NOT BUY THIS CD.
0790729628|3.0|Ridley Scott's &quot;Blade Runner&quot; is an apocalyptic postmodernist vision of the future. The story involves a bounty hunter, Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) who is assigned to kill three replicants - android style robots that look identical to humans, but who have come to earth to seek revenge on their creator - Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel). Sean Young costars as Rachel, the latest model of replicant who is so incredibly life like that not even she knows that she?s not human. Also in the cast are Rutgar Hauer as Roy Batty ? the ultimate killing machine, Edward Olmos as a drugged out police detective, Gaff, and Darryl Hannah, as the psychotic replicant, Pris. Flawed in its narrative, but visually stunning, ?Blade Runner? has developed a cult following - and it is easy to see why. The production is layered with multi-references to the steady moral and social demise of our own society that stir the mind into rethinking this movie as much more than a sci-fi adventure. This version of the film is the re-edited director?s cut that audiences were never shown in 1982. The subtle tweaking of story and plot elements really doesn?t enhance one?s viewing experience so much as it just alters the story in a different direction.<BR>But what a shame about the transfer! Though the general color balancing and attention to fine details, even in the darkest scenes, is adequate, there is simply NO EXCUSE for leaving the chips, scratches and in some cases, tears in this DVD transfer. Pixelization crops up now and them, but the most disturbing part of the transfer is that it fails to pay attention to the dirt and (in some cases) hair, stuck to the film negative. The result is a dirty looking picture that, while perhaps in keeping with Ridley Scott's vision of a dank, hard universe of the future, is most definitely not what the director had in mind. Saving grace: the transfer is anamorphically enhanced for widescreen televisions. The sonic characteristic of the 5.1 audio is rich, though dated. Strong bass and reasonably well balanced dialogue and effects, though there are a few perceived occasions where dubbing in of dialogue sounds possible. And one final insult from Warner Brothers, this disc has NO extras ? not even a theatrical trailer!

B000002KHH|4.0|Does your favorite radio station constantly tell you how \\"cool\\" the songs they play are?  Do they spew clichés like \\"voice of a generation\\" or \\"timeless\\" or perhaps \\"the greatest music ever recorded?\\"  If this is true, then this is the Black Sabbath album for you.<br />Paranoid is the celebrity album for Sabbath.  It is the Black Sabbath album that people who are not fans of the band own.  Why?  Because it had a hit, and we all know that the masses flock to any album that has a song played on radio. This is my least favorite of the near-perfect six albums preceding the disastrous Technical Ecstasy.  I do not dismiss it because it is popular; my opinion today is the same as it was in the early seventies: Compared to other recordings, the production is thin and flat, while the compositions are often bland and inconsistent.  It seemed a step backward from the powerful sound of the first Black Sabbath album.  The blistering lead guitar work on their debut is replaced on this second release by mushy overdubs, while the drums sound like they are made of shoe boxes.  It is also the Paranoid album that called into question the skills of the band; Osbourne's vocals and Butler's bass lines merely mimic the guitar line, which is amazing considering the work they would go on to do on future projects. <br />War Pigs, Paranoid, and Iron Man are fine novelty songs, which I enjoy over the Muzak systems when in elevators or strolling through shopping malls.  Planet Caravan pales in comparison to the equally sedate and sullen Solitude on Master Of Reality.<br />Side B of the album is somewhat uninspired.  There are no real standout riffs.  The songs are heavy on attitude but offer little in the way of creativity.  Considering the society of posers in which we live, it is appropriate that this is Sabbath's most celebrated disc.  <br />Jack The Stripper/Fairies Wear Boots and Hand Of Doom have some nice moments but go on too long as the group seems to be stretching every song to filltime.  The best thing about Rat Salad and Electric Funeral are their titles.  Still, even the weaker material by Black Sabbath is better than the efforts of most bands.<br />If you own an abundance of albums by Tom Petty, Pink Floyd, The Rolling Stones, and The Who, you probably already have this CD and love it -- though odds are you didn't know the lead singer's name until Crazy Train made it to the top of your local Hit Parade.<br />This CD should be easy to find in your collection; it sits next to your one UFO CD (Lights Out), your one Nazareth CD (Hair Of The Dog), and your one Thin Lizzy CD (Jailbreak).
B00005N9CV|3.0|I just don't get the Diana Krall craze.  Mind you, she does have a lovely, if somewhat monotonous voice, and it is well-suited to standards.  What makes me crazy about this CD is how hackneyed the arrangements are.  Every cut, though beautifully sung, is something you have heard before, many many times.  With nothing fresh in her approach to the music if I have a choice between Diana's Cry Me a River and Dinah Washington's, there ain't no comparison. Go Dinah.  It's not a bad disc, but I just don't think Ms. Krall is the savior of American jazz or standards singing her supporters have made her out to be.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is one instance where you MUST listen to the hype, cuz it happens to be accurate.  If you love rock music, or any music for that matter, pick this album up.  Everything else has pretty much been said in these reviews ;)  Long live Radiohead.
B00005JM4Z|4.0|I saw the movie '2 Fast & 2 Furious' in a theater and I'll say it's perfectly upgraded from previous movie of that.<BR>We can see a lot of luxurious tuning cars, exciting scenes with more interesting synopsis. It's really cool. <BR>You'll love 'growling and roaring' engine sound, too. You can hear that almost every scene on newly upgraded version.<BR>I wanna recommend this movie for those who has a hobby and been interested in cool rides. :-)<br />I hope it has DTS sound core on released dvd. I don't know why it doesn't have DTS track on that as previous version of 'Fast and Furious.'. <br />If it is released with DTS sound track, I'll must buy it. :-)
0385504209|5.0|This was a GREAT BOOK. Once I started, I couldn't put it down until 8 hours later when I got to the last page - a little disappointed that it was over, but glad that I had gone along for the ride. Mr. Brown gets the reader into the pattern of breaking codes and by the time the main characters are opening scrolls and secrets, the reader is trying to solve the mystery along with them. I'm only sorry I started with his last book, and not his first ... I'm glad he's all ready working on another Prof.Langdon story. He took just enough facts / blended them with fiction, and created a tale that made you want to help him with his research. This was definitely a good book to read on a rainy weekend ... I look forward to reading his other novels.
0425179877|4.0|In my boyhoood, I collected news clippings of space flights like some others collected stamps. While I knew of the the complete or near-disasters of Apollo 1 and 13 which never escaped media attention, I could not imagine how many more instances of nervous questions there were on the ground at Mission Control Center (MCC) during many of the celebrated successful space shots.<br />Gene Kranz's book provides an insider's view into the inner workings of MCC, all the way from the Mercury program to the final Apollo 17 mission in 1972. Probably better suited than almost any one else to tell this story on how things looked from the ground, Kranz worked his career in NASA up to Flight Director, including for the memorable Apollo 11 and 13 flights which provide some of the most dramatic passages in the book. While the world savored the euphoria of the first men landing on the moon, Kranz tells of how he and his team were worrying about near fatal computer problems with the lunar lander. Most readers will be familiar with the Apollo 13 episode which was well enacted on the big screen with Tom Hanks , but Kranz's book provides some of the finer detail that the movie misses. <br />The book not only provides flight details of the manned spaced shots, but discuss some of the important management and technical issues which need to be resolved to move from Mercury through Gemini and Apollo. Kranz's epilogue concludes with some of his broader observatons and recommendations for future space policy. <br />Readers will be struck by the authoritarian and disciplined management style in the program, which Kranz does not easily hide. The author would probably have done well to use a ghostwriter or good editor. But apart from its prose which lacks elegance and an easy flow, this book provides an illuminating insight into how such a complex management feat was accomplished.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|What a talent! That voice! The phrasing and interpretation from this singer/songwriter are tremendous.  I saw him perform  \\"Follow Through\\" during the Wimbeldon coverage.  I stopped in my tracks and was mesmerized by this dude's voice.  Full of soul. I went straight to my computer and bought this cd. He says his musical inspirations are, in part, the Beatles, Sam Cooke, Van Morrison, Chris Whitley, Hank Williams, Stevie Wonder.  I believe this dude's gonna blow up majorly!  Looking forward to more!
B0000CABBW|4.0|I have invariably found that contrary to expectation, movies from New Zealand have a grim, dark aspect that belie the gorgeous pastoral landscapes which they also offer. This movie is no exception.  <br />The movie is based on an creation myth of some of the Maori people who believe that Paikea, their ancestor,  came to the area on the back of a whale which rescued him when his canoe overturned.  Drawing on this myth, New Zealand writer, Witi Ihimaera, wrote the book on which this movie is based while he was living in New York, when he saw a whale spouting in the Hudson River. The movie has come about eighteen years after the book.<br />The movie centers on the relationship between a twelve-year-old Maori girl, Pai, who is cared for by her grandfather, Koro, a tribal chief, and his wife Nanny Flowers. Koro, who is eager to ensure tribal succesion, trains the first-born twelve year old boys of the community in the requsiite Maori traditions for leadership, but refuses to admit Pai to these classes over her vocal protests.Pai nonetheless secretly eavesdrops on these classes and begins to master the use of the traditional Maori club.<br />I will sparing some other details which should however not be missed when you watch this. The movie reaches a dramatic climax after a group of whales are beached and are doomed to languish until Pai attempts a dramatic feat which nearly costs her life. After this ordeal, she is finally accepted as heir to the tribe which finds renewed strength after this.<br />There is a palpable emotional depth to this movie which comes across not in the dialogue, but in the moving facial expressions and the silent language which binds this community.
B00001NFCY|5.0|By 1999 Creed had quietly sold upwards of 4 million copies of its debut album My Own Prison while getting little respect. They were all ready outselling Korn and Limp Bizkit when they absolutely exploded onto the charts with their 2nd album Human Clay. They also prove they aren't Pearl Jam imitators and our a great band in their own right. This album once again features roaring guitars, smashing drums and passionate vocals. Creed proved they are a great band with this album and not a flash in the pan. If you like hard rock you will love this album.<br />1. Are You Ready. 9/10 Great album opener. Sets the tone for the journey Creed is about to take us on.<br />2. What If. 10/10 Very angry song and very well done. Overall the best song on the album.<br />3. Beautiful. 9/10 About how beauty is skin deep, I really like the guitars on this one.<br />4. Say I. 9/10 Another stand out track. Everything is good about this one.<br />5. Wrong Way. 9/10 I like the drumming on this one.<br />6. Faceless Man. 9/10 Starts off softer than explosive chorus's take over.<br />7. Never Die. 10/10 One of the best songs. I love the lyrics, the guitars and drums really go well together.<br />8. With Arms Wide Open. 10/10 Big radio hit about Scott learning he will be a father. Perfection.<br />9. Higher. 10/10 Even bigger hit. Don't let it get to you that it was somewhat overplayed, it is a great song.<br />10. Wash Away Those Tears. 9/10 Another great song that masters the soft/hard dynamics wonderfully well.<br />11. Inside Us All. 9/10 Really inspirational album closer.<br />Overall a great rocking album with no weak spots. If you can see these guys live cause they know how to play and put on a great show. This album deservingly put them on top of the rock world. Get this album and all of their others.

B00008GKEG|5.0|This DVD set will give you a complete and in-depth knowledge of the Beatles.  I was a fan of the Beatles before I purchased this set, but I am now even more of a fan.  Do yourself a favor and purchase this set before it goes out of print.  On the other hand, don't purchase this if you are not a fan of documentaries because that is exactly what this is.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Ok, I wrote a review earlier after 2 listenings of this album and it wasn't that great...but after a third and a fourth listen of songs such as Paschendale, Face In The Sand, Dance Of Death and others, I realize this album is actually quite good...if not great.  Of course, it's not like Number Of The Beast or Piece Of Mind or Powerslave, but they don't want to make albums like that anymore...that was over 20 years ago...this album is as good as any metal album out there...it just takes long-time Maiden fans to listen to it a few times to get used to the new sound and time-changes.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|When I saw Greendale Live  I thought it was fantastic. I learned a few things about what I believe from Greendale. I learned that perfection isn't always what it seems to be. Greendale also reminded me of the importance of having a good and strong family value structure. I also was reminded that we must care for the earth. It isn't an option but a necessity. Neil Young out did himself with Greendale and I play it over and over again all the time. I think I know all the words by heart. I am looking forward to the movie. I can't wait. Way to go Neil Young and all that made this such a wonderful musical novel.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|The last and in my humble opinion the joint best of Johnny's American Recordings series (Solitary Man is also excellent). I do appreciate that all four in the series are magnificent pieces of work in their own right but these two are my particular favourites. <br />Not many musicians can claim to have influenced so many of music's greats e.g. Dylan, Springsteen, U2, etc (the list is endless). Johnny Cash was (is - his music will live on) one such musician. This album stands as a fitting final tribute to the great man who sadly passed away last week. All, that's left to say is 'thanks for the memories'.
0767802470|5.0|I remember &quot;Das Boot&quot; when it first aired on German TV as a series and recorded it on Beta (hey, my Mom was told that Beta was the wave of the future!) I watched this movie over and over, even got the Buchheim book for Christmas, and in the preceding years wrote a graduate history paper based on the German U-Boot experience. All this from Petersen's masterpiece!<br />The &quot;long version&quot; of the movie - the Director's Cut - is my favorite because it closely follows the series. I've seen the shorter movie version and felt that editing ruined some important nuances. I also liked the dubbing on the Director's Cut, because some of the English translations were done by the German actors themselves (at least it sounded as if Prochnow, Gruenemeyer and Semmelrogge were doing the English translations.) My favorite part is when the crew sings, &quot;It's a long way to Tipperary!&quot;<br />All in all - I HIGHLY recommend this movie, in whatever version you decide to watch. The portrayal of the German U-Boot experience is factual and the acting is above superb.
0312263120|2.0|After devouring all four of Dan's books, this is the only one that I didn't like.<br />In the middle of the book I had a tremendous desire to throw the book away - I wish I had.<br />Way too predictable and dialogue just not up to par.<br />Read the other three.<br />Can't wait for his next book.
6304411448|5.0|This is a quirky romantic comedy about two people who, deemed as misfits by society, fall in love with each other. Featuring outstanding performances by the entire cast, this is a film that lets the viewer know that there is, indeed, someone for everyone.<br /> When eccentric Sam (Johnny Depp) enters the lives of a brother and sister, Benny (Aidan Quinn) and Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson), he changes their lives forever. Benny, it seems, is always worried about his sister who seems to be autistic. He treats her like a baby, making sure that she is never left alone. Highly intelligent, creative, and articulate, Joon, however, chafes a bit under the  thumb of her protective older brother, but she  does have some issues, as  there are certain things that act as triggers for some odd behavior on her part.<br />When Sam begins living with Benny and Joon, acting as a housekeeper-babysitter, Sam treats Joon like a regular person, and before you know it they are falling in love, each accepting the quirks of the other with complete equanimity. Meanwhile, Benny is attracted to Ruthie (Julianne Moore), who owns the local diner. The only thing is that he cannot seem to concentrate on romance, as he is so worried about what the future holds for his sister.<br />There are some twists and turns in the romances between Sam and Joon, as well as in that of Benny and Ruthie. There are some very funny moments, as well as those filled with genuine pathos. There is also a certain amount of physical comedy reminiscent of that of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. In the hands of the adept Johnny Depp, it works.<br />This is a film that will be enjoyed by those who love off-beat, beautifully acted films. Bravo!
B00006LSM3|4.0|I almost forgot he had an album out after his passing.  At first I didn't want to get it, because I thought his voice was not the same, due to his illness.  Well, I was wrong, he sounded pretty good, although, he does sound a little different from what he did in the early days, for a man who was on his way out, he wasn't bad.  He didn't let his illness get the best of him.<br />This album was pretty good, I love the song \\"Stuck Inside A Cloud\\".  I also like the song \\"Any Road\\"; I thought the song \\"Marwa Blues\\", was very relaxing.  The music on that song was so beautiful, puts me to sleep.  \\"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\" was cute.  I like song, \\"Pisces Fish\\", makes me wanna travel.  Well, I like mostly every song on here, at first I didn't like the song, \\"Brainwashed\\", but , I grew to like it.  This is a must have for all George Harrison fans.  Even though this album was Harrison's last; his music will live on in our hearts...
B0000BYM3K|4.0|Alright.I already placed a review on this site about Dance of Death.I'm just going to put another one out because I fully listened to this album and I realy do enjoy it.The title song has such a great 3 guitar part in it its awsome.Listen to this album more than once and you will love it.The first listen you'll be abit disapointed, but the listen to it more and more.It dose have X factor in it ,along with brave new world.This is a great album and the songs are good to.It isn't better than Brave New World because it dosen't have the great chorus lines that you just sing along with.Its good for all Maiden fans. Its on the top 5 Miaden cd's out there.<br />1- Number of the beast<BR>2- Brave New World<BR>3- Powerslave<BR>4- seventh son/ live after death<BR>5- killers/ Dance of Death
B00005JLXE|1.0|The first two (Tim Burton-directed) 'Batman' movies rock.  'Spider-Man' was hugely entertaining.  Even Chris Reeve and Margot Kidder had their moments in 'Superman.'<br />This film, however, is a total mess and unbelievably boring.  In a nutshell:  Awful, painfully dark cinematography, absolutely atrocious acting by the two leads, and a startlingly inept &quot;screenplay.&quot;<br />It's just too depressing.  Hollywood:  stop already, you're killing me.<br />Avoid, avoid, AVOID--at any cost.
B00008X5J3|1.0|You would think that a movie that won best picture should at least be a decent movie.  Not the case with Chicago.  How the heck did this hunk of junk win any Oscars?<br />The movie's plot is terrible.  A hopeful starlet, Roxy, shoots the man that she is having an affair with after she learns that despite what she thought, he has no connection in the nightclub world and will not help her get a gig.  She goes to prison where she meets another murderess/singer, Velma, and Mama Morton, a prison mistress that is the least developed of a string of underdeveloped characters.  Several bad musical numbers follow, Richard Gere's character eventually gets both Roxy and Velma off and they become famous.  Great writing, huh?<br />The manipulation of the justice system in this movie is preposterous.  How is it remotely possible that not one, but two murders get off scott free and then become stars with their own show about, you guessed it, glorifity murder.  Obvisouly, this is not a morality musical.  It doesn't have any good moral in it all.  It is just a stupid story with unlikable characters.<br />People say that the musical numbers in this movie were great.  I can't see how this is true.  These tunes are so unharmonic that its not even funny.  Mr. Cellophane?  He had it coming? What is this terrible cacophony?  In general, I'm not a hater of musicals, unlike some other reviewers.  I just hate this one.  If you want to see a good musical, see Paint Your Wagon.  That is at least amuzing and has likeable characters, including Clint Eastwood.<br />Overall, I agree with many other reviewers that this movie is very very overrated and was a huge waste of money to produce.  I wish that I had the four dollars back that I paid to rent it.  I could have thrown that money down the sewage and gotten more satisfaction.  I know that a lot of readers may not agree with my comments, but I try to review any product honestly and thus can't give good reviews of everything.
0790729393|4.0|If you tell me a story and make it clear from the start that it's fiction, I'll take it for what it is: fiction. But if you tell me a story and claim that it's true, and I find out that it's not true or its truth is questionable, I'll take that against you. Fair enough, I'm sure you'll agree.<br />Given that framework, the controversy surrounding Sleepers makes rating this entry difficult. The film is based on a book (a first-person account by Lorenzo Carcaterra) that purports to be based on a true story, a claim we have to factor in. But numerous critics have thrown a huge shadow of doubt on the truthfulness of this claim, a counter-claim we also have to factor in.<br />There is no question that Sleepers is a powerfully moving story. It draws you in and never lets you go. It works admirably hard at character development and depth. Few other films succeed at making us feel a certain compassion for two apparently cold-blooded murderers. Or understand why a priest would lie under oath. Or condone a District Attorney's breach of ethics when he takes a case with the intention of losing. Director Barry Levinson's compassionate handling of a very sensitive and complex subject matter is indeed remarkable, matched only by the ensemble cast's performances. <br />But we have to go back to that question of veracity. Carcaterra stands by his story, and he's pretty much out on a limb alone on that. On the other hand, the critics (and we're not talking here about the literary type) are legion. That naturally makes us lean more towards the doubters' side. But can we say with absolute certainty that they're right? Or that Carcaterra is right, for that matter?<br />The fact is, that burning question will probably continue to do just that -- burn -- for the rest of our lives. And that is unfortunate. If the book and the movie never made this \\"based on a true story\\" claim, I would give it five stars without batting an eyelash. But because I simply cannot go along with the school of thought that says, \\"whether it's true or not is irrelevant, just enjoy the movie,\\" I have to take away one star. The four remaining are for the sheer power of a compellingly-told, albeit controversial story.
B00005B36H|5.0|1st off tool is probably my favorite band.   they show an emotional, musical, and intellectual depth that has become very rare in music today.   from reading the other reviews here, i get that people are divided in their appreciation for tool.  that is by no means a bad thing, because their music is extremely diverse from album to album, even within albums.  Opiate was a display of raw anger and irony.  Undertow, refined the emotional fury of Opiate into intese, brooding, angry, and beatiful music.  Certain tracks on Aenima were a cry back to the malevolence and fury apparent in Opiate and Undertow (namely Hooker with a penis and Aenima), while other tracks were a hint at the contemplative and insightful mood of Lateralus (Stinkfist and Third Eye).  Lateralus, their latest (and IMO greatest) album, takes a step back from the anger of their previous offerings and asks what is to be done besides get angry about it.  The lyrics of Reflection, Schism, and Lateralus  look deeper into the humanity of Tool than any of their previous work.  Atop of that, the music on the album is a step above their other work.  As an album, the display of Tool's musicianship is flawless and stunning.  It  gives me goosebumps.  For Tool fans who are ready to give up their anger at the world and look into what they can do about, this is your album.  5 stars all the way.
B0000AM6K2|5.0|If the 21st century has brought us anything refreshing it is the slew of good, strong music that has been hitting the CD stores (unfortunately not radio, since radio continues to play drivel on adult contemporary stations )in the past two and a half years. If you know where to find it, there is a lot of good music out there (magazines such as UNCUT, PASTE and NEW MUSIC MONTHLY are great sources) and 1972 is a brilliant example.<br /><br />Somehow managing to channel great musicians such as Paul Simon, Al Stewart and Jackson Browne and yet still keep his own voice, Josh Rouse delivers a pop album with smarts, sensibility and style. If you didn't know better, you'd swear this was an album straight from the good side of the 70s (and in the case of \\"Love Vibration\\" early 80s.)<br /><br />There is not a clunker on this album and you may be tempted to hit \\"repeat\\" on your CD player. Here are just a few of the charmers:<br /><br />  \\"1972\\":  a tribute to Carole King and a mellow, deceptively simple song which stays in your heart for a good while...<br /><br />  \\"Love Vibration\\": a catchy pop tune that makes use of the wurlitzer, flute and the most basic of lyrics and yet says a lot...you cannot get this song out of your head or feet! (In a way this reminds me of the lushness of the Carpenters minus Richard Carpenter's occasional overkill production).<br /><br />  \\"Sunshine\\": This is NOT Brady Bunch material despite what one music reviewer wrote recently. It's a nice percussion piece with an Al Stewart edge to it.<br /><br />  \\"James\\": Sad lyrics and beautiful music. I haven't listened to this one enough to catch the deeper appeal but it definitely stays with you.<br /><br />  \\"Come Back\\" and \\"Under Your Charms\\" are both sensual, rhythmic pieces with a Doobie Brothers approach in a Paul Simon voice (though Josh Rouse's voice is more mellow and lush like Karen Carpenter's to a certain degree).<br /><br />  \\"Sparrows Over Birmingham\\" and \\"Flight Attendant\\" are soulful, yearning songs that evoke the 60s.<br /><br />I wish I could find the words to do this album justice. The best thing I can say is : listen. This is the kind of album you put on the stereo and never want to take off.ng songs that evoke the 60s.<br /><br />I wish I could find the words to do this album justice.

B000065AI3|5.0|This album is hard to find.  I was excited when i saw it and since it's my favorite band of course I bought it.  I was blown away.  I knew a few of the songs before I bought it but the rest of the CD was what shocked me.  The first track, Rocking Around With You, has a strong punk sound to it. For a second I thought I had bought the wrong CD.  It is very simple and catchy with an amazing baseline and a great beat.  <BR>Anything That's Rock and Roll's great acoustic sound blew me away.  The opening riff (reminiscent of the Kinks) grabbed my attention.  This song is rebellious, loud and truly fun to listen to (key components to any great rock and/or punk song!). It it perfectly captures the noncomformist attitude of the late seventies. Unlike many songs of the same ideal, it is unpretentious and completely void of complex and unnecessary instrumental interludes. It gets right to the point without offending or dissappointing.<BR>Hometown Blues is one of my absolute favorites.  I LOVED this song.  Everything from the beat, the guitar, the melody and the lyrics is, again, so simple and classic that you can't help but love it.  This song lacks nothing, except radio play.  I found that Mystery Man stood out slightly from the other songs on the album, with it's slow southern style.  The melody is beautiful and is delivered so effortlessly.  This album also features two of his best and most popular songs, American Girl and Breakdown. <BR>American Girl is simply great.  It's like it was written for and about every girl who dreamed of somthing bigger and better.  You simply can't hate this song.  It is a truly great rock song, not over the top, top excessive, not lacking anything (this one gets played on the radio regularly).  <BR>Breakdown.  The guitar riff at the beginning masterfully sets a dark and slightly mysterious tone.  It is soulful and full of emotion without being soft or weak.  This can also be said for Luna, which carries the same dark but soulful mood.<BR>The only song that falls behind the others is Strangered In The Night.  This is similar in sound to Luna and Breakdown, but doesn't have the same tone.  It is about violence and fear. It is still powerful, but it is the only song of that nature on the album and seems misplaced.  It's still good but not as good as the rest of the album.<BR>This is an amazing album.  It is awesome to see how one of the greatest groups of the last quarter century started with such a simple and classic album.  I have many of Tom's albums but this one is far and away my favorite.  This is a great place to start your collection (from the very beginning... why not?) or makes an excellent addition.  Either way you WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!  (Oh and if you aren't familiar with the Kinks I highly suggest that you check them out!)

B000067FP8|3.0|After the mild success of GREMLINS, there was plenty of room for a sequel.  Not that anyone expected it (especially the parents).  But here we have it, GREMLINS 2: THE NEW BATCH, another horror/comedy which is this time entirely comedy.  In fact, GREMLINS 2 is overall one gigantic spoof of itself.  Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates return as lovers Billy Peltzer and Kate Beringer - this time they're trying to thrive in The Big Apple.  One day, Peltzer discovers Gizmo (the voice of Howie Manel) in a media mogul's science lab.  Of course, Billy takes Gizmo to work with him - and guess what? - the gremlins are back, more hilarious than ever, and led by a super-smart gremlin with the voice of Tony Randall.  The best part of the film is John Glover's hilarious performance as Billy's boss; there's also nice directing by Joe Dante and a fair score by Jerry Goldsmith.  The film, overall, is pretty weak, however; the script is all-out madness, with plenty of star cameos.  The effects are arguable; awesome gremlin effects, [bad] everything else effects.  A hilarious, no-holds barred spoof of itself...lovely, but no where near as good as GREMLINS.

B00005QIPH|2.0|Wow! the way these guys dress is so cool! Thats what the strokes would like to hear isn't it? Because thats all they seem to care about, take real rock stars like Keith Richards and Jimmy Page, they only cared about the music but they still looked cool! I suppose though that because rock 'n roll is now fashionable again there may be some bands that have worked hard actually make it and are not important rock stars because their rich daddies have bought them the breaks. Last Nite, is a good track but it sounds very similar to the rest of the album, they all seem to be the same chords being strummed and the same beat.<br />One day you guys WILL discover good music, just believe!
B00006RU5B|5.0|Audioslave has reached a new level in rock. With the Rage Against the Machine in the band, there is no problems with the music. The lead singer has one of the coolest voices ive heard. Audioslave is pretty good all the way around. There are no weak songs on the whole CD. Some of my favorites are Like A Stone, I Am The Highway, and Getawy Car. The onbe song that got me hooked on this group is Cochise. Not sure what it means but it one of my favorites. If you like any of the songs they have on the radio, you will love this CD.<br />                  ROCK ON AUDIOSLAVE!
0440234743|4.0|I really didn't know anything about this book, so I was expecting the typical John Grisham tale - greedy people with even greedier lawyers and good courtroom drama.  Those elements are there in good measure, but the real story takes place deep in Brazil with Nate O'Riley, a burned out, alcoholic lawyer who takes a soul-searching trip through the dangerous waters in the wild Pantanal.  Why?  To find an American missionary who had suddenly inherited billions of dollars from her late father's estate.  Meanwhile, legal proceedings are immediately started by the other children of Troy Phelan to challenge the will.<br />I've always thought of John Grisham as a good writer, but wow, he surprises me here.  His story telling of Nate's journey, both physical and spiritual, is written masterfully.  The reader is taken along for the ride with Nate and his guides as they try to navigate their way through very isolated rivers in hopes of finding the missionary.  It is then through his eventual encounter with Rachel that Nate's life is changed forever.<br /><br />Back in the States, the courtroom proceedings are classic Grisham - lots of greedy, corrupt characters to keep things juicy.  It is an intriguing, thought-provoking story that has now become my favorite John Grisham novel.
0440180295|5.0|This book is strange, very strange. Death permeates this book and, each time it is brought up the author pops his head above the waters and tells us, \\"So it goes.\\" There are an awful lot of times we see the phrase, \\"So it goes.\\" in this book.<br />Is this an anti-war book, then? If there is a central episode in the book, and that's not exactly clear, it's the firebombing of Dresden on the 13th February, 1945 - an undefended civilian town. Although it's impossible to know how many people were killed, Kurt Vonnegut uses the high estimates in the book. Whatever the number it's clear that this was one of the most disturbing episodes in World War II and one that obviously effected Kurt immensely.<br />The telling of this tale, then, could be considered anti-war. Indeed in chapter one, which is really an extended author's note, Kurt talks about this. He is cautioned against writing an anti-war book - it's like writing an anti-glacier book, he is told, because there is no way to prevent it. And I think that Kurt realizes this. And he tells us they'll always be death anyway. So it goes.<br />\\"The Children's Crusade\\", the sub-title of the book, reveals the truth about the second world war - that it is fought by young, inexperienced unprepared men fighting for a country they don't really believe in. A character appears in the book, an American who has turned traitor and is working for the Nazis, who details how the American poor are so downtrodden that they have no sense of loyalty or proprietary - compared, we have to assume, with the salt-of-the-earth European poor. On this level, this book stands with \\"Catch-22\\" and \\"The Naked and the Dead\\" in giving a brutal, damning account of the ridiculousness of those who actually fought WW II. \\"All the real soldiers are dead.\\" So it goes.<br />But this novel isn't a war story at all. It permeates it but the substance is quite different (by the way, the sample pages are from chapter one which, as I have said, is more of an author's note, so they don't really capture the heart of the book).<BR>The majority of the book is much stranger and is told in the third person (with wonderful interjections by the author as he is heard in the background on a troup train or in the prison camp!). We follow the life adventures of Billy Pilgrim (A Pilgrim's Progress of course), a sad delusioned man who believes he can journey back and forth in time.<br />And that's the way the story is presented - snapshots of time. Click. We're seeing him thrown into the deep end of the pool by his father to see if he'll sink or swim. Click. He's in a prisoner of war camp watching Cinderella performed by British Officers. Click. He's been transported by the Tramalfadorians - an extra-planetary race who see in four dimensions and provide Billy with all of his extraordinary insights. Click. He's in a mental hospital shortly after the war.<br />The mental health of Billy Pilgrim is something we have to contend with throughout the book. Strangely all of his insights provided by the Tramalfadorians have already been written by a fourth rate Sci-Fi author he is introduced to in a mental hospital. At one point he is put on display by the Tramalfadorians in a zoo and has to live on public display - eventually with an adult filmstar who has also been captured. Strangely the science fiction author has already written about such a zoo.<br />So, is Billy Pilgrim just living these books in his deranged mind? Is everything happening as he is recovering from massive head injuries sustained in a plane crash? Is the author a fictional invention of his too, someone visible to him only? This is part of the brilliance of this book. Kurt Vonnegut skillfully weaves what appear to be (and I'm sure are) real-life experiences of his time in Germany during the war with a brilliant but fractured mind.<br />The Tramalfadorians don't read books like we do. They have a set of experiences that are all read in parallel. The great authors are not those who cantell wonderful tales, not those who can define great characters but those who can make the overall feel of all of these simultaneous experiences be emotionally fulfilling. Of course what Kurt is doing with this book is precisely the same thing - we get this small snapshots that seem to come at us from all directions and leave us with an experience that is definitely more than the sum of it's parts.<br />My review really cannot do justice to this book. It is an astonishing work and well worth reading.
B00006AG5N|3.0|i think (pre-military) elvis is great. elvis presely was one of the greatest pioneers of rock music, pre-military of course. this is a great cd that showcases some of his best (or most popular) music. the only thing i dislike is the way the album is presented, package-wise. perhaps the record company could have chosen a name that didn't completely rip-off the beatles 1 album?
B00008DDSC|5.0|I first heard about this movie in my Independent Film Studies class.  Everyone, my peers and my techer made it seem as if this movie was extremely risque.  S&M is defiently something that you could put in that category...but it seemed interesting so I figured it would be something to just watch for the hell of it.  Now in the opening credits I was really expecting a really graphic intense film about wat S&M pertains to, SEX! But I was surprised, sure it did have a wee bit of nudity and some sexual content...but nothing that made you blush horribly and have to hide your eyes (Or as my friend did, turn it off).  I really thought it was a cute romantic comedy that just happend to have some serious issues involved with it.  Defiently a movie I would buy! SO GO RENT IT!!
B000002UAR|5.0|this is the record that everyone should be issued when they are born. many say that the white album is the best beatles album, that it changed music forever, but i disagree. although i do love the white album, i think the beatles started a musical revolution (slightly in rubber soul) with revolver. such sounds have never been heard before, a new style was created with this lp. enough of this convincing, go buy the album and listen for yourself.

B00004ZAV3|5.0|if you're not a die-hard beatles fan but enjoy the fab four's popular hits, this is the album for you. it showcases all of their popchart songs from the earliest to the last. what makes it better than other beatles compilations (i.e. the red and blue albums) is that the songs have all been remastered and sound fantastic. the only problem with the album is that it could have easily been made into a two cd set with some more songs added on. there are many more great songs that should have made it onto the album.<br />ever notice how the seasame street theme song sounds like love me do? hah.
B00005JLSE|1.0|After suffering through this waste of celluloid, and reading some of the outrageous reviews here, I came to the following conclusion:  This movie can be enjoyed only by (1)angry, man-hating white feminists (2)limp-wristed liberal white men, and (3)gaie men.  For the vast majority of normal, hard working Americans, this piece of pop trash was a waste of the price of admission.
0609610570|1.0|This is an incredibly bad book.  Frankly, it's amazing that it ever got published in the first place.<br />One only has to read the gushing superlatives with which the authors write about many of the worlds worst CEO's to realize that they know very little about the real world.  The book has very little pragmatic advice about how to 'execute'.  When tips and tricks are discussed, they are often precisely what NOT to do when attempting to run a successful business.

B000002AD0|5.0|With so many Fillmore records out, it's hard to know what's good to go.  There's a lot of fair-to-middling performances that have been captured at Bill Graham's classic halls on either coast, but an equal number of which were poorly recorded.  This one boasts superior sound and performance, and above all, heart.<br />In a lot of ways, it's superior to their Woodstock performance, and anybody with a penchant for Allman Brothers albums released in '69 and '70 will dig this one.  &quot;Jingo&quot; and &quot;Soul Sacrifice&quot; are particularly affecting, but &quot;Treat&quot; is exactly that; treating SF audiences to a great little jazz piano intro before it segueways into a moving mambo-esque jam by the end.<br />Far better than the studio albums--in my not-so-humble opinion--and much better than most of the other Fillmore live albums.
0679777547|5.0|That's the feeling I get with this erudite, mesmerizing, creepy little tome by Spanish bibliophile Arturo Perez-Reverte: the book is deliciously rich and positively reeks of forbidden knowledge, and the sensation one gets while leafing through its pages (hopefully you can purloin a hardback edition)is akin to having a good pipe over brandy in a darkened, hidden room of a secret library.<br />There is a handful of authors who are entranced by history, but view it not with the mortician or embalmer's eye so much as the explorer's: history is not so much a fixed narrative as it is an amazing necropolis, a labyrinith, a series of catacombs winding beneath the present. Umberto Eco is such a writer; John Crowley is another; and happily for \\"The Club Dumas\\", Perez-Reverte is still another. For Perez-Reverte, there are many secret entrances and recondite passages linking the adventurer in the present to the dubious past.  For the Lucas Corso, rare-book dealer and protagonist of \\"Club Dumas\\", the trick, having gotten through one of these hidden apertures, lies in getting himself out again with skin, and soul, intact.<br />The book begins with Madrid book-seller and rogue Lucas Corso having been presented with two mysteries: one, an unpublished chapter from \\"The Three Musketeers\\" called \\"The Anjou Wine\\" and reputedly written by Alexandre Dumas, sold by the book collector Enrique Taillefer hours before his suicide. The other is his commission from book dealer and magnate Varo Borga, who wants Corso to travel across Europe in an effort to determine whether Borga's copy of \\"The Nine Gates to the Kingdom of Shadows\\", a grimoire printed by 17th century Venetian printer Archimedes Torchia, is a forgery or authentic.<br />Two mysteries for the price of one, and we haven't even talked about \\"The Nine Gates\\" yet. Corso is told that only three copies of the grimoire exist: Borga's, one in the crumbling Portuguese estate of Victor Fargas, and one in the Paris townhouse of Baroness Frieda Ungern, specialist in the occult. Oh yes: \\"The Nine Gates\\" is an infamous work, chiefly because it contains everything a wizard needs to summon up Satan himself. Why is Borga interested in authenticating his copy, again?<br />The attentive reader and cinephile will know that Roman Polanski chose \\"The Club Dumas\\" as the source material for his fine and thrilling film \\"The Ninth Gate\\", but while Polanski distilled the raw (and diabolic) elements from the book, \\"The Club Dumas\\" contains far juicier (though quirky, whimsical, and eccentric) fare. Like Umberto Eco, Perez-Reverte is not an author in a hurry, and he's more than happy to take his reader on a saunter down a curious (though shadow haunted) literary lane.<br />One difference between the film and the book is the character of Corso himself: the character in the book is infinitely more complex, sad, and interesting. Corso is a rogue in search of lucre, true, but he's also a man bereft of his love who spends his idle hours wargaming, re-fighting the Napoleonic campaigns (particularly the Battle of Waterloo), and winning for his beloved Emperor, to say nothing of avenging his French grenadier ancestor.<br />Another difference is the way in which the Dumas manuscript figures in the story, entwining itself with the hunt for the diabolic grimoire, and playing with Corso's literary fancies: the shadowy pursuers become the emissaries of Dumas's fiendish Milady de Winter, while a skulking, lurking, mustachioed rogue becomes the Three Musketeers' nemesis Rochefort. And don't worry, even the villainous Cardinal Richelieu makes an appearance.<br />The result is a heady and luxurious read, full of whimsy and erudition---but don't let that fool you. Beneath the meandering turns into Dumas, Dickens, and Melville, among the interested musings on the fate of the old Ogre of Corsica, lies the book's dark diabolic soul that so fascinated Polanski. Perez-Reverte neatly binds the disparate threads of his narrative up, and the ending is more explicit and troubling than that of the movie.<br />Light your pipe, fill your snifter with brandy, and make sure that secret door to the main library is locked: you'll want to make sure you're undisturbed as you savor \\"The Club Dumas\\". Just don't try any of the incantations.e ending is more explicit and troubling than that of the movie. <br />Light your pipe, fill your snifter with brandy, and make sure that secret door to the main library is locked: you'll want to make sure you're undisturbed as you savor \\"The Club Dumas\\".

B000002IP1|5.0|As the 1980's ended and the 1990's began,Phil Collins scored with a second best-seller,and his fourth all-original album,BUT SERIOUSLY. HANG IN LONG ENOUGH was on the charts when 1990 neared the end. ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE was the album's first hit in November 1989 when this album was released. Other hits include DO YOU REMEMBER?,SOMETHING HAPPENED ON THE WAY TO HEAVEN, and I WISH IT WOULD RAIN DOWN. This album inspired Phil's sophomore band,The Serious Band and the title of the follow-up live album SERIOUS HITS LIVE.
B000000H5K|5.0|This album was the masterpiece that brought in a lot new people to the Sepultribe and sadly lost alot of their old-school fans of their thrash/death metal roots. All in all I'd say this could be their best next to 'Arise'. Sadly it was their final album with Max, what with tensions growing between the bandmates and the recent murder of his stepson, Dana Wells, as Max would go on a few years later to create Soulfly, (and everything with Sepultura will go downhill from here as they bring in Derrick Green) which in many ways can be looked at as a continuation of what Sepultura was doing with this album, all the tribal metal, etc.<BR>If you love Soulfly, I guarantee you will totally dig this one. It's very experimental in a way but Sepultura stay true and don't f--- around. &quot;Look Away&quot; actually features Mike Patton and Jonathan Davis, even though I don't hear him on the song, (Korn's last good cd came out in the same year as well) I think if they were to have made a &quot;final album&quot; type thing, this would definitely be the one to go out on. Best songs would be  Attitude (the one that first introduced me to Sep.), Straighthate, Cut-Throat, Lookaway, and Dictatorsh*t.<BR>Peace out, and keep rockin.<BR>&quot;Live your life, not the way they taught you; do what you feel&quot;<BR>         Dana's spirit lives on
B00000D9TQ|5.0|Since Phil Collins' BUT SERIOUSLY album was released in 1989,he has formed The Serious Band and recorded a live album released the following year entitled SERIOUS HITS LIVE. Now here is a compilation of &quot;serious&quot; studio hits. The track listing of course is a little bit different since Phil has had hits since BUT SERIOUSLY. The lone new track TRUE COLORS was first recorded by Cyndi Lauper in 1986 and was a hit for her. This album lacks Phil's hits like I MISSED AGAIN,EVERYDAY and DON'T LOSE MY NUMBER. This album has Phil's biggest non-Genesis hits.
B0000C9JFO|5.0|In the tradition of many French films, L'Auberge Espagnole is a warm,well written, coming of age and semi autobiographical movie that is guaranteed to stay with you long after you watch it.Cedric Klapish does a wonderful job in telling a story that at first look does not seem to say much, but hides many realizations, which the viewer will subtley unravel one by one. The plot seems simple enough: Xavier a young French student (played wonderfully by Roman Duris)is preparing his future life and career in the EU commision thanks to his father's connections, provided that he acquires a masters degrees in Spanish economics. He goes to Barcelona,leaving his girlfriend behind (Amelie's Audrey Tatou),and after staying with a French couple he meets at the airport, he finally gets a room in a flat he shares with others European students,from Italy, Germany, Denmark, Spain, Belgium and England.He is estatic about his new lodgings and the good vibes he gets from it, little does he know that his life is about to change forever from that moment on.<BR>His plans for a secure career, and his mundane and sheltered life comes gradually under attack from his experiences with his roommates in a foreign city he comes to love: An affair with the wife of a French doctor (the excellent Judith Godreche)the same couple he stayed with on his arrival,his lesson of seduction by a lesbian (the gorgeous Cecile de France),who becomes his best friend, a friendship first sealed by their common love of the music of Ali Fakre Toure (I thought what an original way to seal a friendship!),and the love of life in all its colours he soon discovers.<BR>The core of the film is not about some Europeans getting together in the spirit of a new Europe, with all their cultural differences and habits, it is rather about a young man who finally discovers who he really is and what he wants from life! Barcelona could be London or Paris or anywhere else for that matter, and the students could have been from any nationality, it does not matter as much as the fact that it is about a journey of self discovery and change, this is what makes the film a masterpiece.<BR>I first thought that there were too many characters in the film which could have easily done without, especially that some students, like the Italian, German and Danish characters are more than extras and not quite developped, but by the end of the film, you do understand why Klapish wrote them all.<BR>Apart from Duris's charater, I thought the English characters were well written and provide most of the humour in the film (brilliantly played by Kelly Reilly and Kevin Bishop).It is always interesting to see how the English are seen and portrayed in French films, and vice versa-The love/hate relationship of the two countries is legendary ever since William the Conqueror woke up one morning and decided to have Fish'n'Chips for lunch-but Klapish,although falling slightly in the cliche of the heavily drunk who can't take his drink, he has a sympathetic eye for the 'neighbors across the channel'.<BR>Klapish's aversion of bureaucracy is very well emphasized: the fast camera shots of the EU corridors, the endless forms he has to fill, the men in grey suits who think they can tell a joke, a world that Xavier realizes he does not belong to. <BR>So L'Auberge Espagnole is a movie about friendships, about self discovery and it is about rebirth, a film that should on no account be missed.
B000002IQ9|5.0|Phil Collins does live performances of his non-Genesis hits on this album. The title of this review was inspired by the two live albums following his band Genesis' WE CAN'T DANCE album. Phil promotes his BUT SERIOUSLY album on this recording. This album opens with a BUT SERIOUSLY track,SOMETHING HAPPENED ON THE WAY TO HEAVEN. Then comes,from the Jeff Bridges-Rachel Ward movie of the same name,AGAINST ALL ODDS. Other BUT SERIOUSLY tracks are ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE and DO YOU REMEMBER?. From NO JACKET REQUIRED are SUSSUDIO,ONE MORE NIGHT,DON'T LOSE MY NUMBER,TAKE ME HOME and WHO SAID I WOULD?. From FACE VALUE is IN THE AIR TONIGHT. From HELLO I MUST BE GOING is a cover of YOU CAN'T HURRY LOVE. There are three other showtunes,SEPARATE LIVES from the 1985 movie &quot;White Nights&quot;, and TWO HEARTS and a cover of A GROOVY KIND OF LOVE from &quot;Buster&quot;,which Phil made his film debut in. There's also EASY LOVER,minus Earth Wind &amp; Fire's Philip Bailey. The studio version of EASY LOVER was a duet of Bailey and Collins on Bailey's CHINESE WALL album.
0930289234|5.0|This is one of the greatest books to come out of the last half of the century.  For those who don't know, Watchmen is a fairly postmodern take on the idea of the super hero, incorporating him into Cold War politics and involving literal super powers in the arms race.  Which is not to say that this is some kind of Tom Clancyish techno-thriller; far from it.  The book is an intense, character-driven drama about the little people who put on the costumes and how they face the horrors that the world leaves at their doorsteps.  It's great, sweeping, human epic stuff, one part political thriller, one part whodunit, three parts character study, and I'd recommend it to nearly anyone.  The story starts with the murder of an old costume hero, and his former comrades, long since retired, who may be next on the murderer's list.<br />The writing: Moore's writing transcends the limitations on the medium and pushes it into a strange, beautiful, multi-faceted territory where the complexity of the characters' motivations put the reader in the same kind of &quot;moral checkmate&quot; that plagues the protagonists at the end of the book.  The parallel structure of the book's multiple overlapping plotlines is remeniscent of Thomas Pynchon or J.G. Ballard, and the sureness and consistency of his style keep the story flowing.  Since the plot is so complex, Moore reveals it in pieces by setting up individual chapters as studies for the individual characters, with key events seen from their unique perspectives.  As their different experiences of the same events yield more clues to the book's initial mystery, Moore uncovers something larger about the characters themselves, and maybe even people in general.<br />The artwork: Dave Gibbons's stated philosophy is that the art should get in the way of story as little as possible, and it's a philosophy which is clearly visible here.  Gibbons avoids obviously flashy layouts and silly-looking splash panels and merely tells the story.  There are no full-page panels until the final chapter of the book, which is extremely appropriate and helps the story and art blend into a single, unique creature.  His renderings are clean and balanced, and his anatomy is perfect.  The art is barely noticable the first time through, but it grows on you like fungus.<br />Overall: If there were ten stars on this list, this book would get them all.  It's a fantastic reading experience and a great introduction to a form that most people don't think twice about.  Try it out, and if you like it, try From Hell and A Small Killing.
B000002JB3|4.0|DANCE INTO THE LIGHT was not much more successful then 1993's BOTH SIDES. The title track and IT'S IN YOUR EYES were the only hits from this album. But this album does continue to sell otherwise it wouldn't be advertised on this site. Phil covers Bob Dylan's THE TIMES THEY ARE A-CHANGIN,previously covered by Peter Paul &amp; Mary,Simon &amp; Garfunkel and Billy Joel. Phil tells another story on this album entitled JUST ANOTHER STORY. It tells about an abusive drunkard and his family. This album is pretty cool.

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I picked this cd up on the day of its release, and I couldn't be happier! This cd surpasses EVERYTHING you though APC was capable of. Their music has expanded so much since the last album. the heavy tracks such as &quot;Pet&quot; and the single &quot;Weak and Powerless&quot; reel you in, while more melodic tracks such as &quot;Blue&quot; and &quot;The Nurse who loved me&quot; keep you beggin for more. I couldn't be more impressed with a cd. There are so many different styles of music implemented into this album. Looks like A Perfect Circle has done it again!
0375713751|5.0|Allison Pearson knows how to tell a story -- the life of Kate Reddy, working mother and wonder woman for our time. Reddy has a terrific way with words that makes you laugh out loud, chuckle later and be charmed by even the most awful moments of Reddy's life. Okay, so it's over the top in some places, but isn't that's why you buy a book like this-- to have some fun with what may be happening (or not happening) in your own life. Even if you don't have kids - you'll wonder how she does it. Want to know the secret???? She fakes it some of the time. BUT you'll have to get the book to see how she makes quiche and other goodies, keeps a perfect house and an adoring husband and children that shine. I wouldn't dare violate the confidentiality and trust that author Pearson seems to demand from her readers who are let into the secret world of Kate Reddy working mother and super heroine. Can't wait to see the movie. Who's going to play her -- that's the big question. Maybe a TV series??? It's a little like Make Room for Mommy (not Daddy), and LUCY entwined in one for the 21st century..... downright hilarious. Episodes seem so real you forget that Pearson is NOT Reddy (or is she really??) Click your mouse to order today, mash your couch potatoe and stir in some romance and add a real laugh track to your life NOW.......SHE REALLY DOES IT!!!!!
B00004RFCM|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows. Although I don't get HBO I started the Second Season. I didn't know what was going on, I agree with another reviewer I was glued to the screen. I then saw the Third Season it is dramatic on some of the characters but still good humor. Now I liked the first season. I am planning on buying Seasons 1-4 on DVD. I can't wait for Season 5 DVD.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Maynard had a lot more influence on this album over their previous release (most of the songs were written before he joined the band). For a huge Tool fan such as myself this is a great thing. The energy swings around, building to crescendos and coming down with a crash in classic Tool style, while maintaining A Perfect Circle's unique and more subdued sound. There is greater variance between songs and more creative orchestration.<BR>For me the real magic of this album begins at track 9 with 'The Nurse That Loved Me' and 'Pet'. It will be interesting to see how that evolves with more listening.<BR>Although I will keep my preference for Tool, this album makes a good alternative when I need something less offensive (i.e. parents around for dinner!)

B0000BYM3K|1.0|Yup, Janick's \\"dancing\\" was the \\"death\\" of Iron Maiden.

By that logic, a \\"true\\" fan will accept whatever they are fed, no questions asked, regardless of the junk being laid before them. If that's the case, then I'm not a \\"true\\" fan.

Which I believe actually gives me a bit of an edge, since I do have the ability to be a bit more objective in my views. I like how all of the \\"true\\" fans vote no on all of the unflattering reviews of the album, while you rarely see a nay-sayer strike back similarly. I'm glad I'm not a \\"true\\" fan...Anyway, as far as a review goes, one must first be willing to listen to the songs, which brings us back to the \\"cover\\". <BR>Mannequins? Stupid, computer generated MANNEQUINS?!?!?! <BR>If Steve is going to start taking over everything, why can't he give doing the the cover art a stab. maybe he can do better than whomever is the johnny-come-lately they've hired for the cover art.

Well, I did manage to check the band roster and, yup, Janick is still there. That's all I needed to see. I walked on.<BR>Only 2 changes need to be made to bring back an enormous portion of past \\"fans\\"--who were not \\"true\\" fans, mind you, since they had better things to do than listen to sub-par replacement members--these 2 things: First, drop the ballerina posing as a 3rd guitarist (it's like a bike with 3 wheels, which is a tricycle and that's for children so bugger off!) because Adrian has returned and frankly Gers is not helping anything with his goofy spinning and leg-kicking--it's plain silly and not very metal;and secondly, Steve needs to lighten up with the \\"i AM Iron Maiden\\" attitude he's developed over the past 10 years. I don't care if he's the founder of the group, now he's directing and editting videos (his greatest achievement being the pathetic \\"Holy Smoke\\"), producing and co-producing albums and, if he had learned anything at all from the universal scathing his production \\"talents\\" got for 'A Real Live Dead One', he'd shell out the cash to end Martin Birch's retirement.

0452282152|4.0|GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING is a quick and relatively simple read. Although there are some sleazy sexual come-ons by the rich patron and other scenes, the sexual content is fairly mild and it would be appropriate for a teenager, certainly one Griet's age. I think fans of historical fiction would enjoy it too, if for no other reason than Chevalier's concept of the story behind the painting certainly seems probable. It's a wonderful book I know I'll read, again. Buy it! Also recommended: THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez
038533348X|4.0|Vonnegut was trying to make a point with these words at the beginning of \\"Cat's Cradle,\\" but they're wrong. The events and characters may be foma, but the things that drive this book are all too real.<br /><br />\\"Cat's Cradle\\" is the story of John or Jonah and his attempt to write a book about the events of August 6th, 1945, the day of the first dropping of the atomic bomb. His efforts begin weaving his karass with those of the Hoenikker family, children of one of the prime scientists who worked on the bomb.<br /><br />Foma? Karass? These are Bokononist words. While this book is written by Vonnegut, the tale tells that it's been written by John, after the events of the book. He started his book as a Christian, but has since converted to Bokononism, developed by a man named Bokonon, a Buddha in his own right. Bokonon's religion is simple: Make lies, be happy. It is at the beginning of his book that it claims the entire text is foma, or lies.<br /><br />Vonnegut has created an excellent conflict within the politics of San Lorenzo, the island where Bokonon lives, and how it draws John in as a catalyst for events to come. While the end result is not his fault, it's interesting to see how he learns of things that will happen, and since the book is being written by him, he comments on his own thoughts and those of others in the past. This isn't very new, but often first-person narrative books make the character not know what's happened, even if they tell everything in the past tense, even so much as to know how long ago the events took place.<br /><br />Within \\"Cat's Cradle\\" and stretching into a few of his other works, Vonnegut has created an entirely new and original religion, one that professes openly that nothing about it is true except it's theme, which is exactly what is true about the novel.<br /><br />Little Newt Hoenikker represents the second best theme, the first having been the religious implications present. His traumatic obsession with the cat's cradle and the fact that he wonders why he can't see the cat, not as a six-year old, and not as an adult, shows that sometimes people are expected to see what they cannot see, and that it's ludicrous sometimes to expect anyone to see it.<br /><br />The most intriuging questions of all lie in what the character Mona says late in the book, after the climax; questions that are sure to have you yourself wondering about things in our world, in the real life posed by this book.<br /><br />Above all, \\"Cat's Cradle\\" is an interesting book that will keep you reading. I originally heard of it through the movie \\"The Recruit,\\" where Ice-nine was used as a code for a computer virus. Ice-nine is something very different here, and its effects are monumental, even when simply discussed hypothetically earlier in the book.<br /><br />While many Vonnegut books are primarily for those who enjoy Vonnegut's dark humor and style, \\"Cat's Cradle\\" is a novel that can be enjoyed by pretty much anyone old enough to read it. It is anything but foma.
B000068TPN|5.0|WWS succeeds on several levels. To lambast the movie because it is not \\"accurate\\" is pointless since there is yet to be made a movie ever anywhere that was \\"accurate\\". This is especially funny in light of reviews written for other Vietnam War movies like Apocalypse Now. Most of those movies are sheer fantasy. Most are attempts to revise history to suit the personally ground axes of political activists. But since WWS refuses to go down the path of depicting US soldiers as druggies and war criminals it will naturally attract the ire of the culture of draft resister types who have dominated the film industry. Thus movies that depict US troops as decent people are rejected by the Old Guard and ones that depict them as scum are lauded.<br />WWS was made by one of a rising newer generation of filmmakers. These new filmmakers are too young to have been draft resisters and are thus not subject to the uncontrollable urge to justify their cowardice by degrading those who didn't hide behind deferrments or self-inflicted wounds and thus avoid military service. After all, those who refused to serve seldom ever want to discuss the subject and those who did serve are generally though well of by the average American today. Just try asking for a show of hands at any public gathering. Ask any large group how many dodged the draft and none will admit so willingly. It is funny, sort of like finding out after WWII that Germany was full of people who were against Hitler, you will find how many people \\"support the troops\\" but when their turn came they ran.<br />This shifting of filmmaking to a younger generation is something that should engender optimism. Without the personal necessity to justify their own previous discreditable acts these filmmakers have the potential to finally show the Vietnam War in a more accurate light.<br />The reason WWS was treated badly by so many critics boils down to the reviewer's personal political views. Too many are of the culture that foolishly believes that people can remain free without having to fight for it. Even if the Vietnam War was a horrid mistake one must remember that none of these draft resisters new these facts at the time. It was amazing how almost overnight the big protest rallies stopped when the draft lottery started and all those college students were no longer personally threatened. Apparently, absent the threat of the draft, college students find that shooting beers is far more important than trying to \\"bring the boys home\\". <br />The Vietnam War occurred at a time when Soviet communism was working as hard as it could to turn the entire world into a totalitarian slave state. The namby-pamby refusal to confront reality that is prevalent amongst too many westerners doesn't change the fact that our civilization was under attack by murderous and ruthless people (Lenin, Stalin, Mao, etc). These thugs had murdered some 100 million people while trying to create their \\"workers' paradises\\". This fact must never be forgotten when dealing with the time period of the Vietnam War.<br />Vietnam may have been a mistake, but had Soviet Communism prevailed there would be no freedom of speech today for mealyminded intellectuals to insult those who fough to preserve our freedoms. There would be no Internet or Amazon.com for people to engage in political argument on at all. There would only be one big slave camp. <br />WWS deserves 5 stars for attempting to show that the Americans who fought there were mostly decent people only doing what they saw as their duty to their country. The soldiers deserve a far better break than they've gotten in the past and WWS gives it to them.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|So far, although i cant say that the entire cd has &quot;sunk&quot; in yet. I've found that this cd is about what i would expect from a great band such as A Perfect Circle, and from a great vocalist such as Maynard James Keenan.Maynard's voice of course is spectacular, an the rythems are dramatic an very beautiful. Its definitly as good as the last one, possibly better(once i get a real chance to look at all the lyrics). Overall, i would say this CD wont disapoint any Perfect Circle fans, or Tool fans for that matter :)
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|The album sounds beautiful at parts. I've yet to digest the whole thing. I havn't read the vocal information yet, but I could swear that the vocals aren't Maynard. They aren't bad but it's definately different sounding than the first album. I'm gonna say buy it and enjoy it for yourself. It's rare nowadays to get a decent rock album. I also wanted to say that the actions taken recently by the RIAA are unjust and they will fall. The consumer will consume when they are ready, right now the economy is not ready, the music produced lately has been shallow and pointless and you are only making it worse for yourself by taking actions against your core consumer. EFF forever!
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|THis is the second release from a perfect circle.  This cd is excellent.  THey also have a new line up with Twiggy Ramirez formerly from manson, who replaced PAz Lenchantin.  Troy van Leeuwen also left the group and was replaced with James Iha (smashing Pumpkins)  THis cd isn't as hard as Mer de noms, but is definitely more soulful.  Its bascally a concept album about taking 13 steps from anything.  If you are definitely a fan of Maynard and You liked Mer de noms this is the cd for you.  Its the peferct progression for this band.  It will definitely get you thinking.
B00005JLKB|5.0|The popular TV series on the WB channel follows the life of young Clark Kent (Played by Tom Welling) as a teenager. He discovers his amazing super-powers, grows up with the girl he has a crush on Lana Lang, and develops a friendship with a a evil genius, who will in time become the bald Lex Luthor. The Kryptonite that falls in Smallville with Clark causes some crazy things to happen, giving the young hero plenty of opportunities to save the day and one day become Superman. This is a great show that I encourage anyone to see. This set includes a 6 DVD Box set, that includes all 21 episodes, deleted scenes, season 2 sneek peek, and many other extras. I just hope they release LOIS & CLARK: The New Adventures Of Superman on DVD soon.
B000002HH9|4.0|a diverse, musically adventurous foray for a great band. Themes of loneliness and loss pervade, as do spontaneous outbursts of joy - befitting the title.<br />There is a &quot;gut instinct&quot; feel to this album that happily crushes the stylized, pre-packaged stuff other bands deliver on the radio everyday.<br />The Cure has done success on their terms, bringing the audiences with them each time.
B000003TA9|5.0|Dirty and Daydream Nation are the only two Sonic Youth albums I own, but they are both utterly amazing, though for different reasons. In the case of Dirty, its for cooler-than-cool, disaffected post-punk and grunge-pop. More song-based and straight-ahead rock than the somewhat proggy Daydream Nation, its nevertheless tempered with fine bursts of white noise, magical guitar duelling, grinding riffs and propelling, heavy bass.<br />Everyone mentions '100%' and 'Sugar Kane', and both are good, the former a driving, posturing, cool punk number and the latter a radio-friendly, poppy rock song. However this album by no means stops there. Springing to mind is the utterly wonderful 'Theresa's Sound-world' which builds from quiet, reflective melody to a wall of beautiful, heavy, ear-bleeding noise. 'Drunken Butterfly' is propelled by a catchy riff (recently ripped off by Cooper Temple Clause for their single 'Promises Promises') and an earnestly ironic chorus of 'I love you, I love you, I love you, what's your name?'. <br />Their political drive comes to the fore on the slower, but equally menacing 'Youth Against Fascism', which contains sneering vocals, a monster of a bass sound and guitars that sound as if they are being ritualistically tortured rather than played. The album veers from creepy ('Shoot', 'On The Strip') to all-out punk ('Orange Rolls, Angel's Spit' and the cover of 'Nic's Fit'). The more commercial 'Chapel Hill' sits alongside 'Sugar Kane' nicely, but every track on here has a sense of melody. Then there is a bit of lunacism, like the strange and twisted closer 'Creme Brulee'.<br />Every track on this album digs its own musical furrow and the album is all the better for it as despite its length of 15 tracks each one is worthy of high acclaim. Above all, listening to Dirty, you get the sense that they were influencing scores of alternative bands to come: much of the album seems a template for bands like My Vitriol, Cooper Temple Clause and Ikara Colt, 'YouthAgainst Fascism' seems to have influenced Mclusky and 'Chapel Hill' sounds like it may have wormed its way into the minds of the Manic Street Preachers at times. This is an amazing album, an equal of Daydream Nation, and probably the best starting point for newcomers to this brilliant band.
0312263120|3.0|Dan Brown wrote a winner with the DaVinci Code.  His other books are not bad but they are not as good.  Digital Fortress is very interesting but technical.  I found myself skipping some science, wanting to feel about the caracters and their lives.  The language is intelligent but it appears a little less technical would have done just fine.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|to Mer De Noms.  Maynard and friends do it once again with these haunting ballads.  This time around A Perfect Circle brings a more dark and somber depth to the table with more tribal sounding softer rifs in Thirteenth Step.  Fans of Tool to Tori Amos will appreciate the album.  While this album goes even more softer sounding than Mer De Noms, it seems to have alot more depth and spirituality.  Arguably Maynard's best vocals since Aenima.  Josh Frees does an amazing job on the drums.  You don't even miss Paz (who went to Billy Corgan's flop band Zwan.)  With the steady decline of music quality (i.e. cookie cutter pop rock/pop punk) in our day and age, A Perfect Circle sheds a glimmer of hope once again.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|It's a sad truth that most counterculture movements fade out as quickly as they start. In today's world, it's almost impossible for bands to survive on their own in the world without merging into the corporate machine, and eventually selling out. Or they just break up. As 1980 drew near, all the punk bands in the United Kingdom seemed to be falling victim to this trend.    Enter the Clash, who not only were an exception to the rule, but somehow managed to pull off the impossible with \\"London Calling,\\" the definitive Clash album, and in all honesty, an album that people who've never even heard of the Clash (except for Rock the Casbah) might enjoy. All the negative energy of punk - the ideals that contrast against society, the arrogant, yet stoic defiance against everything evil, and the icy, almost sadistic humor - has been meshed with multiple styles of music to create a record overflowing with gems.    The title track will immediately leap right out and grab your attention, even before the first word is sung. And if the implied anger of Mick Jones's grinding guitar riffs or Topper Headon's bombastic percussion don't pull you in, Joe Strummer's vocals definitely will. In true punk fashion, he belts out ominous visions of a post-apocalyptic nightmare (remember the Cold War was still going on, and England was even closer to the Iron Curtain than America), but he does it with a smirk of sinister glee as he sings \\"A nuclear era, but I have no fear, 'cause London is drowning out/ I live by the river.\\" The fact that their country is in the crossfire doesn't bother them at all, and they proclaim that message with unbridled defiance. In the next song, Brand New Cadillac, Strummer laments the loss of his girlfriend with all the charisma of a British Elvis, intermingled with a fiery solo from Jones, and more pulsating rhythms from Headon and bassist Paul Simonon.    Then things get interesting. After setting what we presume will be the core musical theme for the album, the band branches off in all sorts of directions, combining the edginess of their sound with myriad other styles, from jazz, to rhythm and blues, and even rockabilly. The first such of these new tracks, Jimmy Jazz, is more laid back than the ones before it, and deals with (what else?) the cops searching for a man who fights the establishment. But here, Strummer's low growl and Jones's scratching riffs are joined by several horns, and there's even a sax solo. The boys continue to surprise us as the album progresses, spinning more dark tales: a man who hates his drug dealer, but needs the goods he [the dealer] provides (Hateful), a man lamenting the loss of his beloved, who presumably was killed in the Spanish Civil War (Spanish Bombs), a satirical look at a [then] new trend among wealthy American businessmen known as cocaine (Koka Kola), and yet another song about lost love (Train In Vain). But the way they blend their bleak yarns with musical genres more upbeat than basic punk makes you stand up and take notice. Of course, there's still straight-up punk songs like Clampdown, Death or Glory, and Four Horsemen, which occur at regular intervals, and really provide a sense of how well the band sequenced the music on the album.    Lyrically, the Clash maintain the dark stoicism, as well as the perverse sense of humor which was seen in the title track. In The Right Profile (with another jazz motif floating in the background), Joe Strummer makes light of late actor Montgomery Clift's drug and alcohol addiction (as well as the car accident that nearly killed him), but at the same time happily shouts that he wants to run home and grab his old movie stills. Likewise, Wrong 'Em Boyo, a song about a craps game gone bad, is sung over a bouncing organ ditty that almost reminds one of a Calypso party. In addition to the horns, the band uses the piano and organ extensively, and even manage to slip in some harmonica.    Mick Jones also does more singing than on previous albums, and he andStrummer alternate verses on several tracks in some very moving vocal harmonies. However, Mick's moment of glory comes when he takes the lead for The Card Cheat. The passion in his voice as he sings of a man who's played the game of life and lost might make some people weep with despair (I nearly did). Of course, he does as good a job on Lost In The Supermarket, though this one is more quiet in its regretfulness (in words as well as music), and provides a much needed lapse in the musical tour-de-force. If I analyzed every song like this, we'd be here all day, so I'll just speak of a few more tracks that stand out from the rest of the fare.    The Guns of Brixton is Simonon's contribution to the album, and fits the formula set by Jones and Strummer perfectly. The lead and rhythm guitars take on an almost southwestern twang, which is loaded by drum fill from Topper. One could almost picture this in the soundtrack to a Sergio Leone western.    Then there's Revolution Rock, in which Strummer assumes the role of band leader, spinning a tale of cautious optimism amidst the destruction and unrest. What really makes it stand out is how the horns are the only instruments here that maintain any rhythm. As Strummer urges everyone to \\"smash up their seats and rock to this brand new beat,\\" Mick, Paul, and Topper belt out a deliciously uneven melody, which only serves to make the beat more revolutionary. This song, more than anything, sums up what the Clash has done the entire album: walking the fine line between being corporate sell-outs and the battered-yet-defiant voice of the underworld without once losing their balance. If they crossed over either side at any time, this album would have been a disaster. Instead, it's one of the greatest albums ever recorded.     Rest in peace, Joe. You and your bandmates have achieved immortality with this masterpiece.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|After falling in love with APC's first cd, I thought it would be impossible for anyone to follow that cd up with one that was just as good.  I've been proven wrong.<br />A Perfect Circle's Thirteenth Step album is an excellent addition to my collection of albums.  Thirteenth Step still retains the sound of the original APC album, while implementing some new techniques and sounds.  The album also keeps APC's mix of different song sounds and rythms from their first.  From the very beginning of the album you can tell that a lot of work has been put into the songs to make sure they were perfect.  I've begun to believe that it is impossible for Maynard to make a bad album, or even just an ok one, and with the addition of this album to his list, I'm only believing that even more.<br />If you enjoyed APC's first album, you will love this album.  A few of my personal favorite songs are Blue, The Package, Crimes, and The Outsider.  It is very hard to decide which of the songs are my favorite, as I enjoy every single one of them.  I've listened to this cd pretty much exclusively since I got it, it is just that good.
0385504209|2.0|OK, so this seems to be &quot;THE&quot; book to read right now. And so, hearing the raves (although not from anyone I know personally), I went out and read this one. What a disappointment. The big flaw in this so-called thriller is that Brown doesn't let you in on the solution. He tells you only so much, giving you obscure clues that you could NEVER figure out, introducing clues at the last minute. And giving you an oh-so-pat ending that you feel like throwing the book across the room when you finish it. And the characters are incredibly dumb and unconvincing (a cryptologist that doesn't recognize DaVinci's backwards writing? Gimme a break!). Trust me: spend your time reading something more rewarding. Like, maybe, the National Enquirer?
B0000AR8NK|5.0|People who are waiting for Bowie to return to his original form will be very pleased with this album. While there are a few songs that still contain some of the electronic/techno beats of Bowie's last several albums most of the songs on REALITY shine with guitar and old school rock feel. While the lyrics are pure Bowie weirdcoolness this may be his best album of the past 10 years. Bowie pays a very nice tribute to the late George Harrison on this record as well.
0064407667|5.0|I'm having a great time reading this series aloud to my children, and they are enjoying it immensely.  The style, the pacing, the cliff-hanger chapter endings...all contribute to the fun we're having.  When the action gets intense, I shut the book and ask questions.  What should Violet do next?  What would you do?  We even talk about the law, and how people should have a will drawn up.  We talk about how brave the children are.  But we also talk about how today they could call 911, and how they should not feel helpless.  The aside definitions sometimes spur discussion, with my 8 year old saying that he knows what that particular word means.  But often he doesn't know the word.  Anyway, the series is working for me and mine, and it's great to read out loud.
B000089RVX|4.0|Evanescence sounds like night and mist, mystery and coldness. And that is always the impression of the new bands that have dark album covers. Nevertheless, when I heard and saw the video of &quot; Bring me to Life &quot; it was just captivating (well, that's all right, the band's booster song&quot;. I ventured into the MP3 world, heard the song over and over again and said &quot; hey, why not buy the CD&quot; which also captivated me and motivated me to write this review. The CD is just a masterpiece of art inside the rock culture, because it brings new sounds and a potent female's voice, backed up by a heavy yet harmonious marching tempo guitar and a melodramatic, strong protesting piano, with drum arrangements that fill in the room and finally the powerful yet beautiful Amy's voice that manifests that women can also do soulful rock without falling into senseless and repetitive covers or complaining songs ( the Osbourne/Lavigne uncomfortable teenager situation ). Definitely, you can tell beneath their songs the strong influence of Tori Amos and meat loaf's influence. Still, as an emerging band, their songs still reflect a little bit of &quot;strange&quot; lyrics, but this will improve along with musical maturity, and still are creative and interesting, no for them to change style. Is definitely a CD worthwhile of buying and playing several times. New band, new style, it was about time.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I received The Beatles &quot;1&quot; as a gift for my birthday from my boyfriend's mom in April of 2001. As I listened to it on my computer, it brought back many memories of when I first heard and saw The Beatles. I remember the first song I heard, 1964's I Want to Hold Your Hand.  I was almost 10, and at the time I was discovering boys and their silliness and looks, so this song brings back memories of those sweet and innocent times.<br />For Beatles fans of my generation, this 27-song collection of No.1 hits by the Fab Four will bring back many great memories spanning the years 1963 through 1970. Although only one of my two favorite songs (Hey Jude) is featured on this album, such hits as Yesterday, Come Together, and Let It Be are here for either long time fans to rediscover or to be found by a new generation of Beatles fans.<br />This digtally remastered addition comes in an attractive jewel case with an illustrated booklet full of memory evoking photos. The sound quality is excellent, and its mix of songs is worth the price of purchase. I heartily recommend this album.<br />PS: If you must know, my other favorite song is Do You Want to Know A Secret. (....and now you know.)
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|It is now 12pm 9/16, and I have now owned the new APC album for 3 hours. As I put it in my car stereo, I was in awe as the first track was unopened before me. The Package is an amazing amazing song. It clocks in at 7 minutes and 40 seconds. It begins as an odd percussion rythm that drives the song with subtle guitar coloring the background while Maynard smoothly sings chopping the melody with the tap of the drums. Maynard actually uses his falsetto for to mould a memorable chorus into your ears. The bass is strong throughout the whole album and the lyrics are better than imagined. weak and powerless we all know, nuff said. The noose is a tingling track that is so quite and beautiful. Maynard's lyrics in the chorus melody hint to his chorus performance on the Deftones passenger. At the end it all weaves together in Mer de Noms Thomas like fashion. The next song, Blue, is more upbeat and incredible with a playful joke by maynard hinting at Aenima by opening with &quot;i just didn't want to know, best to keep things in the shallow end because I never quite learned how to swim.&quot; This song could be a single easily i think down the road. The voice over dubs pull you into this song with ease. Next is Vanishing, which may be this albums type of Brena song, concluding like an escaping breath and pounding rythms that recall Thinking of You. A Stranger is like Renholder with words. Very lovely and mellow and mjk's are amazing, really. The Outsider is for sure a future single due to its chugging guitar and aggressive vocals similar to maynard's tool styles. This song is a kind of Judith but more intricate and crisp musically, and has very dark and flowing bridges between parts. I can't describe this song well enough just find away to hear it. Crimes and the Nurse Who Loved Me are tracks that may make most peoples eye brows raise for sake of displacement on the album. the peacefulness is shattered by Pet which slams you with distortion and then cuts away and grows into thechorus. the first line is &quot;don't fret precious I'm here, step away from the window&quot;. Mr. Keenan drives this song with forward motion. Lullaby is like Crimes of the Nurse, so we'll jump to the last track which is Gravity. Gravity was written by the old formation of APC, with Paz and Troy. This song is crucial for the end of the album. It sounds much like Mer De Noms manipulated to relax at the foot of this album. The last line is &quot;I Choose to Live&quot; which echoes as would a voice in a memory carrying you out of the album, or rather the experience. This music is differnt from anything they've done, definately a development or growth on their part. Billy is genious for putting this stuff together while maynard was on tour with tool, and they hit the nail on the head. Its is a much needed arrival and opens the mind for hope of what music can do. and oh, by the way, there are only 12 songs on the album, the 13th step is what you make of it. Take the energy you get from this album and do something positive with it, Art Saves Lives. Maynard said that.
0375414053|5.0|I have a view of both sides here - with my first child I worked full time from the time he was 8 weeks old.  With my second I am a work from home - maybe 10 hours a week - mom.  I know that for me and my children my decision was the best.  For some they just don't have the option financially or emotionally.  It's certainly not the best decision for everyone.  But this book clearly weighs in with the pros and cons.  <br />If you feel like no one can relate to the struggles you are in as a working mom - you must read this book.  Trust me we CAN relate.  We've been there and done that!!!  <br />I especially like the bit about leaving the kids home alone so she could run to work really quick to complete a project.......Don't we all pull up in front of the store and say \\"Man I really just need this one thing....can't I just leave them here for a minute while I run in and out?!\\"  But no we lug out the double stroller strap in the kicking and screaming two year old and ultimately end up balancing the newborn while we navigate the unnavigable stroller through the aisles of the store only to find that one item is out of stock and we have to do it all over again tomorrow!!!!<br />Trust me this book is a must read!! I have recommended it to all my friends who have kids, are pregnant or are thinking about getting pregnant.  Being a \\"Career\\" Mommy is hard work!! And Kate knows all about it!!!
B00008IAMD|5.0|This happened to be an incredible disc and an overwhelming video, given his declining health. Now that the Man in Black has left us, it rises in ways no one could have foreseen. It is a GREAT CD! Rarely has anyone put together a collection of songs so thoroughly interconnected. All of the themes deal with death, redemption, forgiveness, the sublimely subtle details of honest hearts. These songs are presented so unaffectedly that it is in fact a virtual textbook lesson in songcraft.<BR>&quot;Danny Boy&quot; is resurrected. &quot;Hurt&quot; has never been more effectively performed. Cash's opening title tune, &quot;The Man Comes Around,&quot; is so phenomenally prescient it is scarey. The extended version of this set comes with the vieo for &quot;Hurt&quot;, which makes this essential recording a categorical imperative for anyone who finds meaning in American song.<BR>Johnny Cash was the genuine article. The diamond in his soul has never shone more brilliantly than on this CD. That leaves Gordon Lightfoot, Willie Nelson, John Hiatt and precious few others who have actually lived and found some wisdom in the process.
B0000BYM3K|2.0|After the mediocre \\"Brave New World,\\" there was hope that the next reunion album would be much stronger.  The last album contained some good tracks, namely \\"The Wicker Man\\" and \\"Fallen Angel,\\" which indicated stronger days may be ahead.  All hopes were dashed upon listening to \\"Dance of Death.\\"  The new album suffers from bad production, the same bass intros Steve Harris has been using for the past four albums, and overly repetitious, formulamatic songs that have plagued Maiden for quite some time.  Even some of the guitar riffs are strikingly similar to previous efforts (the opening riff of \\"Montsegur\\" is almost identical to \\"Fallen Angel\\").  Much of the album feels like a recycled jumble of ideas mashed together with no real structure. There are strong bits spread about here and there, but they get lost in the endless repetition.<br />Apart from Janick, song writing and production continue to hinder the band.  In addition to Steve's overused, cookie-cutter bass intros, his lyrics are particularly bad (e.g., \\"And I danced and I pranced ...\\"). Steve's songs on this album also sound like derivations of his 90's material - which isn't a good thing.  Steve calls all the shots with Maiden, and that goes for production as well.  The last few albums have been mixed poorly, almost like someone can no longer hear the full spectrum of human frequencies properly.  The rhythm guitars and bass are muddy.  Long gone is the crystal clear signature Maiden bass line, and both the vocals and drums are mixed too far to the back.  Nicko is also surprisingly quiet in the mix, and there's hardly an interesting drum fill to be heard.<br />Despite the above, there is some good guitar work by Adrian and Dave (Janick continues to be a blemish).  This is not a \\"St. Anger\\" level catastrophe, as there are some decent songs worthy of a listen. However, I don't think it will take long for this album to end up gathering dust on most people's CD racks.  While many fans would praise even a countrywestern album by Maiden, an equal amount may have a hard time swallowing this one.  As a fan since 1982, part of me would like to see Maiden continue making albums, but this album may force things to an end.  Perhaps it would be best if Bruce and Adrian left again to make great solo music.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Some of the reviewers on here are hilarious. They give the record one half-hearted listen and are &quot;outraged&quot;.<br />I think this is easily Eminem's best album. There is a dark undertone in it that sets it apart from the others. While &quot;Slim Shady&quot; is great, it is definitely a debut, and not too mature, and &quot;The Eminem Show&quot;, although also strong, is a little more commercial and uncomfortably polished compared to the &quot;Marshall Mathers LP&quot;.<br />Honestly, this is one of the CDs that got me into rap.
B000001IPL|5.0|Dookie, ... And Out Come the Wolves, Stranger Than Fiction, Punk in Drublic, About Time, and Smash. This is how you define modern Punk music. You cannot have the current crop of punksters without these mammoth titles. The Offspring's &quot;Smash&quot; is a wall of crunching guitars, throbbing bass lines (yes, even in Punk music), breakneck drums, screaming lyrics, and all with forever memorable melodies. <br />If straight ahead hardcore or speed punk is your thing, this is an OK album, but The Offspring break from the traditional genres within Punk to create a unique sound. &quot;Smash&quot; is the album that defines The Offspring's sound. The key to their catchy songs on this album is the unusually strong melodies in the songs. You can find yourself humming almost any of the tunes on &quot;Smash&quot; and you won't know it until someone asks you what you are humming. That's the sign that you've heard a catchy, memorable song.<br />Stand out tracks are the radio singles, &quot;Come Out an Play,&quot; &quot;Gotta Get Away,&quot; and &quot;Self Esteem.&quot; Each song is quite different, but still get considerable airplay because of their distinct sound. The Offspring successfully experiment with Ska on &quot;Come Out and Play,&quot; &quot;What in the World Happened to You?,&quot; straight ahead &quot;Rock&quot; Punk on &quot;Gotta Get Away,&quot; and create a stadium shaking, singalong anthem with &quot;Self Esteem.&quot;<br />The lyrics show broad mix of topics across the album. There is humour &quot;What in the World Happened to You,&quot; corporate/political cynicism &quot;It'll be a Long Time,&quot; &quot;Not the One,&quot; youth angst &quot;Self Esteem,&quot; and self identity &quot;Smash,&quot; among other topics. Here you see a sample of lyrics that represents the spectrum of Punk lyrics. Most bands follow one or two common themes, but on &quot;Smash,&quot; The Offspring pretty much covers it all.<br />Whether you are looking for something to bang your head to, lyrics to make you think, perfect air guitar riffs, or scream out loud melodies, &quot;Smash&quot; has it.<br />Consider The Offspring's &quot;Smash&quot; to be a defining album, of any kind, of 1994. The lyrics show a change in society and music at the time, and the musicality of the album has been borrowed from and referenced to for almost ten years now. Ten million copies sold helps too.<br />Turn to level 11 and enjoy, after all, music soothes even the savage beast.<br />-silvercanadian
B00004XONN|5.0|this is the album that made radiohead popular to the world, but not to me. their first album i heard was amnesiac, i thought it was really weird so i was close-minded about it. later my friend brought the bends and ok computer over to my house when he was spending the night. i listened to OK Computer and immediately fell in love with the band. it was something different and new, just what i was looking for. now i have alot of their albums, and i just got Kid A about a month ago, and i love it so much. the beginning of the album captures you with curiosity as you hear the weird yet addicting songs. The National Anthem is the only really rock song on the album, and its a very cool song. Moring Bells an Motion Picture Soundtrack are very emotional songs and provide a great ending for a great album. I encourage listening to, if not buying this album. Radiohead has baptized my taste in music and it can never go back to what it was.
1573229725|5.0|_Fingersmith_ ranks with, perhaps surpasses, my long-favorite Victorian styled & set modern novel, John Fowles' _The French Lieutenant's Woman. _Fingersmith_'s early scenes are from the poorest, most crowded, and most corrupt streets of Dickensian London. Then the novel takes a turn into real depravity, as we visit the world of the Victorian sexual imagination -- a world where very nasty books take the place of human emotion and human contact. The extraordinarily well-rendered settings are worth the 5 stars; the twists and re-doublings of Waters's plot stand as a bonus. Great reading!
