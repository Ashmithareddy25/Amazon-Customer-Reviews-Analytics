B0076DELIG|3.0|ok ,lacked some of the other Harry Bosch excitement. not that suspenseful trying to figure out the who done it factor
B000UR9T8W|5.0|I thought I had already reviewed this product. I didn't buy this product.<br />I hate when the site updates there sites and can't keep the ratings and notes on the items.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this cd -- I play it all the time and make all my friends listen to it when they come over! I love Love Love this CD. Somehow the word WOW is just not enough!

1451627297|3.0|I enjoyed the concept of this story, which I found to be quite interesting. The protagonist's quest to alter history and the present alike by averting the death of JFK was an engaging, crazy ride, filled with typical King weirdness. I'm not exactly an American history buff, but it seemed to me like King did his research when writing this novel, as it includes quite a bit of detail pertaining to Oswald, JFK, and the Dallas area.<br /><br />I only rate this book three stars, however, because much like \\"Under the Dome\\" and some of King's other thousand-pagers (as an FYI, I've read all his books, and I'm a long time fan/\\"constant reader\\"), this one just seemed to be bloated and filled with way too many pages of filler that was not necessary for moving the plot forward. I would have loved this book if it had come in at about 500 pages. Many King fans will enjoy the way the story can go on and on about Jake's exploits, thereby further fleshing out his character, but it was just too much for me. I was always anxious for it to get back to the fascinating subject matter that we had been promised- JFK and the altering of that historic moment in time, 11/22/63.
B00008EYA5|5.0|I thought I had already reviewed this product. Like the movie. I hate when the site updates there sites and can't keep the ratings and notes on the items.
0446585041|5.0|I really loved listening to this book on audio. Ellen has a way with her words and her delivery that is just hilarious, and it feels as if she's talking directly to you, as if you're an old friend, enjoying a nice bottle (or box) of that wine she's always pining for. I never watch her show or anything, but she's known for her unusually friendly, charismatic personality, and this book definitely reflects that. She is truly an exceptional human being.<br /><br />It was great to hear her somewhat rambling thoughts on a variety of topics, and you can never entirely tell if she's being serious about something or not. She has perfected a very unique form of comedy that is both funny and genuine. And most refreshing of all, as she points out (and her reason for not enjoying her time on American Idol), she simply doesn't have it in her to be mean to people, even in the form of constructive criticism. She's the rarest of humans- a person who is very funny, and does not do so at the expense of others.<br /><br />Her book's subtle message was also very thoughtful and uplifting- no matter what others may think of you, be happy with who you are. We all deserve to be treated like human beings, and the world is a much more enjoyable place when we're kind to one another, when we embrace laughter, and when we accept everyone for who they are- including ourselves.
B004EPZ07K|5.0|I thought I had already reviewed this product. Love the movie . . . Ryan Reynolds - Hot..<br />I hate when the site updates there sites and can't keep the ratings and notes on the items.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|that was sweet and I wanted to see her covered in that milky substance in my house oh yea hot<br />kill the white chick just a pain in the ass anyhow
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I am really enjoying this book.  It explains the entire process of WWI, in a way that is easy to understand.  An excellant read.<br />I'm looking forward to reading the entire trilogy.
B000B5OD4I|1.0|One of the spring bars that came installed is a common thin one, not the thick original it should be. So it rattles very much, the bracelet is loose, and it just feels insecure in my wrist. Can't use it because it feels like the spring bar is going to break and come apart and the watch is going to fall to the ground at any time.<br /><br />Now I have to pay for spring bars and have then installed.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|This Batman, along with The Dark Knight, is an amazing work and continues the Batman saga in many great ways.  Bane is my favorite villain from this trilogy, hands down.
B002UNMWAG|5.0|I love the original Boondock Saints movie and thought this was very good as well. Not disappointed in this sequel!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|One of the best movies ever. I have watched it about 20 times now...<br />Everyone has to see it immediately.
0446580848|3.0|I was never 100% sure that Joe and Kate survived \\"The Lions Game\\", so I was glad to see them, and I had an \\"oh my gosh\\" moment when I realized who Paul Brenner was, but...It was obvious that Mr Demille had done a lot of research, because 90% of the book read like a documentary on Yemeni culture and history. John and some of the other characters kept me laughing and got me through the slow parts. It was worth the read, but it had the potential to be so much more.
B008ELUEQC|4.0|Love love love Rod, especially back in the day of Faces.  How well he's aging!  Songs are lovely, too!  Bought 4 as gifts
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys are always relaxing to listen to. These guys are talented and if you haven't looked them up their music videos on the internet yet, you really need to. All their music is even better with their videos.
B008EZVNO0|3.0|Not a &#34;hot one&#34; by old Van.  But enjoyed it, nevertheless.  A few good tunes overall.  If you love Van, you'll enjoy this.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Not only is this the best Christmas movie ever(IMO), this blu ray is very good quality. Wonderful picture, and also a great Dolby Digital True HD mix. Very glad I bought this, we will watch it every Christmas, as we have the past 5-6
B005FITIDC|3.0|I was expecting a good Christian story, but what I got was a hollywood version.  It was a decent movie, but definately not safe for the entire family.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Really good blu ray set. Specially for under $30 delievered. The video and audio were top quality on the two dark knight movies.<br /><br />My review scores:<br />  Movie  audio  video<br />Batman Begins  7  7.5  7.5<br />The Dark Knight  8.5  9  9<br />The DK Rises  8.5  9  10
B000001GQH|5.0|Here's an album that is a great choice for listeners who are building a great classical music collection. The works included, Mussorgsky, Ravel, and Debussy (added to the original LP) are all time-honored staples of the art. Herbert van Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic do not disappoint providing lush, lively performances of all three composers' material.<br /><br />One benefit of this recording that some listeners might find useful, all the individual suites of PICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION are divided up as individual CD tracks. Some recordings, such as Lorin Maazel's fine production on Telarc digital, present the entire suite with no individual tracks. With a work like this, some times it's enjoyable to just play a track or two. Karajan's rendition provides the all the drama and suspense when needed, the grandiose spendlor of other segments, and the humor and playfulness for other segments. It's a well-balanced most effective presentation of the popular orchestral version of the compostion.<br /><br />Karajan's treatment of Ravel's BOLERO is a nicely balanced, even-keeled performance, that builds to the full orchestral climax at the end building suspense and anticipation as the tune progresses through its paces.<br /><br />Debussy's LA MER was not on the original LP release of this material. Thematically, it's just a little out of place here versus the more boldly dramatic other works on this CD, Karajan provides a nice dreamy reading of Debussy on one of the composer's most popular orchestral works.<br /><br />This CD is highly recommended for listeners working on building up quality performances of the mainstream historic repetoire. I'd venture to say most experienced classical collectors already have beloved versions of these fine compositions.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have just become acquainted with the Piano Guys two weeks ago. I have downloaded absolutely everything I can find. I only wish I could also have DVD's for the songs. The scenery is magnificent as are the orchestrations. Buy any one of their albums for last minute Christmas presents. The recipients will think you once they have listened to the music!
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|This is a cute movie, and the price was right.  It is funny, cute, and cheesy just what I like :)
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I have loved this t.v. show since the beginning and this is just another great installment in the world of Supernatural!
B009A9EPLM|5.0|How does this guy keep bringing out great score after great score.  I can imagine that this uplifting and powerful yet subtle music complements Spielberg's film perfectly.  Any listener of great film scores and indeed great music should get this in there collection.  Thanks John, you did it again!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book. I saw the movie before  I read the book but I was pleasantly surprised to find that I enjoyed the book much more than the movie. There is a lot of deeper plot structure that the movie fails to capture. If you enjoyed the movie than you will definitely find this a phenomenal novel that you won't want to put down until the very end.
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|The movie was slow, sad and never picked up. Sorry Meryl I love your movies, but I did not enjoy this one.
B000BKJ78U|2.0|I bough this disc set as used and of course one of the discs were scratched. Luckily PC DVD drive was able to read it even if living room Bose refused to work.<br /><br />And Han Solo shoots first. And ghost of Hayden is less patriarchal than original.
B00AHSINKO|1.0|Very didactic, great acters, very weak movie. I felt uncomfortable to watch this film - very artificial. Sintetic, non realistic, plot
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Obviously, I have now read the first two books of this trilogy. This book, along with the first, is a disappointment for this Follett reader. I enjoy historical novels, and this one reads a little like a Lanny Budd book, but without any emotional pull for me to get back to it. I just went along, but couldn't wait for the book to end. There don't seem to be any central characters that one would want to know and that made for a boring read.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|This game is quick and will keep you on your toes! You have one minute to clear enough gems to collect the trophy stars and the gold needed to move on to the next level.  There is no danger of boredom with this game. Lots of fun and easy to play.
B003K15IF8|5.0|A book best enjoyed by those who enjoy reading literature.  As I read the book, I felt sorry for Stoner and what appeared to me, by all accounts, to be a sad, melancholy and regretful life.  But at the end of the book, I don't think Stoner would feel that way about his life at all.
B00A2IUHM6|4.0|I really got a kick out of this movie, but I will say that it is in no way a movie for kids; that is unless you want to sit down & have a long discussion with your kiddo as to why his Teddy Bear does & says really nasty things & theirs doesn't. :). The humor at time can get a bit overdone, with the bear just because he is crude, but there are more scenes that are just plain funny!  Mark Whalberg is as always, stead, confident & blends into his role so believably that you'd think he's been living it for real.  What I do love?  Whomever did Ted's voice is perfect for it.  I purchased this movie, because i had seen it in the theater already & knew what to expect, but it might be a good rental for most people first, to see if its your kind of humor.  He loves oh-yeah, oh-yeah also! Haha! I hope that you have fun watching it like I did.
B000FC1E0I|5.0|As most children have done, I've seen the movie of this book as a child. But never before has my imagination been alive as when I read this. Way better than the movie!
B000M5NRLC|5.0|This is probably one of my favorite movies of all time, and a favorite Holiday one for sure!  Jim Carey is incredible as The Grinch, the sets are amazingly realistic & ALL of the characters (and their makeup) are simply amazing!  I think this will end up being a classic.  Great Family movie as well, to introduce your kids to The Grich that we grew up with!!  Enjoy! :)
B006VGGAC4|2.0|I'm living without my kindle while they read it... they liked it. I could care less, as Arnold is not one of my favorites.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|GOOD PRICE AND GOOD QUALITY FOR AN EXCELLENT MOVIE DVD STORED ON AMAZONS CLOUD MEMORY. i CAN WATCH ON MY PC AS MY WIFE DOESNT CARE FOR THIS SERIES. wITH HEADPHONES, I GET NO COMMERCIALS AND BETTER SOUND THAN tv HAS.
B001NHNG64|4.0|I truly enjoyed book #1, and didn't think this was as strong...but well worth the read.  And I look forward to reading #3++++
0446572764|1.0|I'm willing to risk the good will of - apparently - the entire internet, in order to say that I really didn't enjoy \\"Child 44\\". Perhaps, largely because I have lived 'over here' for about twenty years.  Sure, it's an argument from experience, but isn't that what \\"Child 44\\" purports, at least in part, to be?  An argument drawn from historical experience?<br /><br />I understand the fascination with the soviet experience, the good and the bad of it. I have been dealing with that fascination almost all my life - as a son of Slav parents who were not ethnically Russian, but who knew \\"the Soviet thing\\" in a real, experiential way. It's like a disease. It's something George Orwell talks about in his outstanding essay \\"the Prevention of Literature\\" when he stresses \\"the poisonous effect of the Russian MYTHOS on English intellectual life.\\" We're all suckers for it. I believe that \\"Child 44\\" fails to approach that MYTHOS with any kind of serious consideration or respect.<br /><br />Books like Tom Rob Smith's (and David Benioff's even more laughable \\"City of Thieves\\") just tick me off. They unconsciously glamorize something that has no glamour. None. They legitimize it by trivializing it, if you see what I mean.  A cartoon is certainly much easier to handle than a 12-part documentary on PBS.  But labeling Child 44 cartoonish does a disservice to cartoons.<br /><br />Let's get something straight: I understand how pop fiction is supposed to work.  And I'm no prude. I love a good murder mystery, a thriller, an espionage yarn filled with liars and LeCarre's 'seedy little men'. Thomas Harris's Hannibal Lecter books have a delicious horror and offer moments of outstanding lyricism. Read the first few pages of \\"Hannibal\\" (I think it's the third in the series) and tell me if the prose isn't deeply moving.<br /><br />The murders, the gore in Child 44 - ostensibly based on the crimes of soviet serial killer Andrei Chikatilo - did not turn me off.  They are a matter of record and fair game for a fictional treatment as much as anything else. But Smith's writing, its utter lack of subtlety, its ignorance of the nuance of soviet life, its tedious cause and effect line of reasoning, its all or nothing take on everything, its omnipresent melodrama, its historical distortions, and its tin ear for the Russian language, ugh. It all feels like a story a tourist who visited Moscow for a week would tell his family when he got back home to his solid homeland which boasts drivers who follow traffic laws, the presumption of innocence, and hot water on demand.  Oh, and a homeland with NO SOVIET PAST peopled with the credulous who already believe in their hearts that Russians are not quite up to snuff.<br /><br />I couldn't disagree more with those who loved \\"Child 44\\" - particularly with those who have been deceived into thinking that they \\"really learned something about Russia\\" - I hated it. So, for anyone who has an interest in the real horror, the absurdity, the humanity, and the ache of that period, there are so many better options available to you. Fiction, non-fiction, journalism, essay, genre fiction, and poetry: Solzhenitsyn, Grossman, Babel, Bulgakov, Akhmatova, Brodsky, and from perestroika to post-soviet - Pelevin, Tolstaya, Sorokin, and Dovlatov. They'll be harder to find, often harder to read, but they'll talk about real things. Things that Tom Rob Smith is only guessing at. And, to my reading, guessing wrong.much as anything else.

B000NYT1M6|5.0|My 7 yr old son loves this truck. He's played with it constantly since it arrived. Great price, fast shipping, worth every penny!
B0095R64AO|2.0|I love Emiliy Blunt and really like Jason Segal but their combined likeablity can't save a film that loses its way in the middle. 5 years isn't just how long their engagment was its how long this film was . It just draaaaaaaags and shoe horns break ups and other relationships before the eventual reconciliation. A paint by numbers rom com but add being forced to watch the paint dry.
630587493X|5.0|I will love this movie forever, it reminds us, how precious this life is.<br />And Robin Williams does a great job plying the Android: called: Andrew.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|Love little dorrit.<br />I waited for more than a year to purchase.<br />I finally felt like i found the best deal and i'm extremely satisfied.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game has been modified many times. I personally think every modification has been great! Although I still prefer the PC edition I think u should buy this app. Trust me every modification keeps getting better and better so it will be easy to please u. :)
B005FISC52|5.0|AMAZING. I love this show and it was shipped fast and it arrived in great shape, like I knew it would. LOVE!!
B0096CDG0O|5.0|This game is lots of fun to play with friends.  It is easy to down load and is a great time killer when riding the ferry.
B002NHGG92|5.0|I first discovered the Vampire Diaries through Amazon.com-I did not have the TV station that played the episodes. So, I purchased/viewed the season 1 series through Amazon.  I was impressed, beginning with the very first episode.  There is a very good storyline, along with plenty of action and twists in the plot, to keep you on the edge of your seat.  The Vampire Diaries does not dissapoint.  I'm moving on to season 2 and continuing until I catch up with the current episodes...
B0095R3D0I|5.0|one of my all time favorite movies. i've seen it 100 times, it never gets old. great for the whole family.
1401207529|5.0|This is the first comic I ever bought and it gave me a very good first impression I recommend this book.
B009FZFONO|5.0|The season is awesome. The clarity of the content was very nice and didn't really have many problems streaming in HD.<br />I defiantly recommend watching it.
0486438600|5.0|Good beginner's book ,great price. Dover is a great place to start for people without natural talent. For a small price you can see if you will want to continue further and walk away with a little something.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Excellent, Mike is my all time favorite Novelist.  Merry Christmas Mike & Harry Bosch.  Looking forward to more of Mikes great books.
3833160454|5.0|Good beginner's book .Shows the process and  has more information  on workshops to attend In case you really enjoy  making your own shoes.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a great story and I love that it keeps going and getting better and better. Highly recommend to everyone.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Watched the show on Netflix, and decided I needed to further support this show! Voting with my dollar as they say. It's a quality drama that kept me entertained every episode. Give it a watch on Netflix, or buy the DVD / BluRay.
B007UQRW62|4.0|My rating is not for the movie, it's for the collection set. Honestly, I'm more interested in the memorabilia than the quality of the audio or discs, so if you want to know more about the technical stuff, skip my review, but if you too buy collector's editions more for the goodies that also come with the discs, then this review is for you. I was kind of disappointed with what was in this collector's set. The umbrella is cute, but it's pretty cheap quality, so I won't be using it for fear of it breaking. I do like the little umbrella charm that's attached to the bottom of the umbrella though. The book was pretty thin, I was expecting it to have more pages and what was in the book was info I already knew from wikipedia... The information in the book wasn't very in depth. They had a few pages about Judy Garland though.. Don't really know why she was included when she was not in the movie...The mini posters are nice though. Maybe it was bad for me to purchase this along with the Sound of Music 45th Anniversary Collector's edition (but Amazon did decide to feature both of them together on their Musicals Deal of the Day) because the latter costed less and included more stuff and in my opinion, was the better purchase. Overall, I love watching Singin' in the Rain and since I already had the 2 Disc Special Edition DVD version, I should have just gotten the 1 disc blu-ray instead.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|Story line was a bit to dark, for my taste.  Check it out, you will like it.<br />Great for demonstrating the sound system...
B002RKS81O|5.0|Awesome product would order again as well as tell my friends about this amazing product. The delivery time was fast!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Can't get enough of Harry.  This should be a series with William Peterson as Harry.  Michael Connelly writes great books.  Keep them coming.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my husband for Christmas this year.  Arrived just as described and I know he will be very excited to relive one of his favorite childhood movies!
B007THA4FI|2.0|Could not get past the first chapter, totally uninteresting; I thought this book might be different from the others she has written.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|there is too much cursor lag to even play the bubble game.  it's a bit frustrating to play that one.  Did the same thing on the umbrella game.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I would recommend this book! I bought this one and then got every other Austen book ever written because I love the romance and time period.
B0076DELIG|5.0|are u kidding did u not see i bought both the hardcover and the kindle while i was awaiting its arrival i reread the closers my no one writer  harry bosch is everyman hero
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I watched the movie first, unsure how I felt about the phenomenon of the series.  I loved the movie but needed to know what happened next in the series.  So I bought all three books and have not been disappointed - except that it had to end.  The first book is so much better than the movie and when I watched the movie a second time I felt sad that they changed/omitted so many details from the book that make the story great.  Collins is an amazing story teller.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I was very impressed with this entire set. First, it was great to hear and see Led Zepplin with great production. Second, while John Bonham could never be replaced, his son Jason is a rock solid drummer who obviously cared and respected the music and band. His performance was spectacular.<br /><br />I'm a guitar player, so Jimmy Page always impresses me and he is definitely getting better with age. John Paul Jones is the same story, a great musician. I was truly surprised at how well Robert Plant sang their songs! His energy, his pitch, his entire performance was wonderful. I expected him to go the way that many aging rock singers go vocally, but he hasn't. He can still be a great rock singer.<br /><br />I highly recommend this set. Also, delivery was fast and the package was perfect upon arrival.<br /><br />Now if only Led Zepplin would record and tour again...
B00005JLEX|5.0|I love Seinfeld.  These two seasons were actually bought for a gift but I have them as well.  I enjoy watching the first two seasons because it's interesting to see how much the characters' styles changed throughout the show.  And the classic shirt button conversation that begins and ends the series.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|This is a perfect device to transfer files to your ipad/iphone.<br />It's quick and easy. Just plug it and it will work.<br />Love it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I bought the Hunger Game series after I watched the movie.  The books - at least the first one - is so much better than any movie could make it.  I needed to know what happens next after I watched the movie.  The book is well written and the it is probably my favorite in the series.
B000FCKGPC|1.0|This book had so much extra and unnecessary page filler that by Martins on account (the last chapter) you will have to read another whole book just to see what happens to half the main characters of the third book. If you want to read a hundred pages of background to get five pages of storage this is the book for you.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was sad to end this book because I loved these three books.  But I was happy with how Collins wrapped up the series.  If you enjoyed the first movie you should definitely buy the book series as they are more detailed than the movie and in my opinion so, so much better.
B000FBFN1U|2.0|Martin the champion of useless window dressing. This book starts his useless page filling in earnest. The exciting climax of this book has about four pages of copy in his next book. What a let down!
B0087ZG7PW|5.0|I have always liked this movie and, now that it is part of my library, I love being able to watch it whenever I want. I really enjoy perusing the drawing board sketches for scenes that were never filmed. I had never had the opportunity to view storyboards before. It was quite interesting. Just like the plot with great actors and actresses bringing a very different story line to life.
B000FC1HBY|3.0|Good book but is the start of Martin's let's fill up some pages. I just finished the forth book in the series and it was so full of useless background information that now I need to read fifth book to find out what is going on with half the characters from the previous book. I doubt that the fifth book will get to the point either. Find another author with another series. You would be wise to not invest your time with this series.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I thought this book wasn't going to be any good but it was it keeps you wanting to read more.I'm defiantly reading book two :)
B0007TKNII|5.0|I HATE MUSICALS!  But I love this movie!  I wasn't going to watch it but a friend of mine told me to watch it before I judge it.  So I took her challenge.  I fell in love!
1451695195|5.0|Well my wife also got this Meningitis illness due to a bad epidural injection. She also had  visions of heaven. She believes there is an after life which is better than the life on earth. My wife often feels that you can't go to heaven by self inflected injury that causes death. Until, you have lived through something like this author, and the others like this, I feel that not everyone will believe in the after life in heaven.
B008K8VDPU|1.0|iTunes has better piano apps that is also for free. Maybe it was just the kindle that limits the response.
1250027624|5.0|This is a fantastic book - a great companion to the first book - The World of Downton Abbey.  The photography is excellent, and the character studies are well-written.  I especially love the history of this period which is included and related to each character.  Also enjoy the pages of pictures of items which had a place in the daily lives of people living at this time.  I would highly recommend the book to any fan of Downton Abbey - can't wait the Season 3 to begin.  THE CHRONICLES OF DOWNTON ABBEY IS WORTHWHILE READING!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Kindle fire updates way behind the times.  already December and no Christmas decorum ornquests like ipod version.  Also no way to earn free cash by watching videos like ipod version.  And third reason this review gets one star,  without a recent update the game freezes. I'm at level 90 and don't want to restart.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|This is one of the best albums I have ever heard from Linkin Park and I am so happy I now own it!
B003NX76BM|5.0|The book was very good. It was a hard one to put down. This book was really interesting. Hope she write more like this one.
0307592731|5.0|the telling is fairly balanced to my opinion. a physically rigorous trail walking while spots on<br />her life as brief episodes keep things in perspectives. there's the mother figure which is above<br />it all. she dominates the authors observations and introduces another trail ...loosing a parent.<br />the backpack \\"Monster\\" and trail logistics were very entertaining and not too technical while the<br />vistas sufficient details felt like walking along with the author. one more thing... she's alone<br />on all these trails... solitude; is the main reason I enjoyed reading it.

0143119680|2.0|I would like to answer one of the many questions some readers have expressed about this book. Why did the author make Diana be in her 30s?<br /><br />She has to be in her 30s because that's the only plausible way for her to have multiple degrees and have published multiple academic titles. Get it now? Of course, in every other respect, she acts just as I would expect a renowned alchemical scholar and multiply-degreed person to act... (joke). There is a kind of genius in being able to make genius so dead (get it?) boring.<br /><br />The other thing that really annoys me, even more than the constant putting on of black clothing and drinking tea and wine, is the way Diana constantly refers to Matthew, in her interior monologue, as \\"the vampire\\". Do you think of your love interest as \\"the man\\" --- or, e.g., \\"the social worker\\"? If she were a real person, she would just write about \\"him\\" or \\"Matthew\\", not \\"the vampire\\". This is one thing that tells me \\"the author\\" has not really gotten into the head of \\"the heroine\\", which might explain why many readers feel puzzled about their lack of empathy for her. She just doesn't seem like a real person. She is a catalogue of actions (e.g. tea drinking, rowing, putting her boots on, shooting sparks out of her fingers, etc).<br /><br />And it peeves me, too, that the main plot thread (the manuscript) disappears for chapters at a time. No one's thought about the book for days it seems. I would be obsessed with it if I were in Diana's place (she's supposed to be an academic and a witch... how could she just forget about it?) And then, she's persuaded to go to France by the promise of getting her hands on this rare alchemical book... and when she gets there, she doesn't even obsess about that. She is NOT a real academic, she's just so unreal in every way.<br /><br />I sort of doubt I can finish it. I'm halfway through and if I read about any more horseback rides, baths or how her hair is behaving or misbehaving, I may put it right intomy Value Village donation bag.<br /><br />I gave it 2 stars because I don't hate it. I just don't think I like it enough to finish it.

B0076DELIG|3.0|Harry Hole is getting tired. That's what I took away from this book. It is still a decent read but not the best effort by Michael Connelly.

B002Q1YDLI|5.0|Although this book can stand alone, it is that much better after you've read Something Borrowed.  You get to hear thestory, from Darcy's perspective, she is something else! But as you read you learn tha she is growing as a person and you begin to really love her!  I wished that there would be another follow on Darcy's and Rachel's story.  Wonder if a movie will be made of this one too???
B005P4PAVK|5.0|Just go and see it.<br />Funny, smart and very creative and instructive since most of the jokes are about real science with a Twist.<br /><br />Just loves this series. Can stop laughing!
B008EQIEWS|3.0|I liked this movie and if I could have figured out how to give it 3 1/2 stars I would have. I'm such a fan of the original Clash of the Titans with Harry Hamlin that unfortunately I compare him to Sam Worthington who has the personality of a rock.<br /><br />Anyway, if you're in the mode for a good 'ol dose of mythology, this is a good fare.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Not only is it a really good story, and entertaining, but it teaches us something about a time in history that was very real. I enjoyed it, and will watch it again, and again. You can relate with certian situations and people in it. They're so like the people in the town I grew up in.

B008XX6J4C|5.0|I collected the sings as singles when they first came out, so I have not purchased the album - yet! The Piano Guys make wonderful music that turns popular songs - sometimes very overplayed ones - into awesome mashups with some of the most recognizable pieces of classical music.<br /><br />Bourne Vivaldi can be listened to for pleasure or as inspiration to kick your workout in high gear. Peponi takes the Coldplay hit and makes it so much more cool!<br /><br />Their videos are half the fun, and I have been able to watch them get better and better since about a year and a half ago.<br /><br /> Watch the video for Peponi - it will take your breath away - same thing could be said for all of their music.

B007REV4T8|2.0|To launch a new James Bond film comes with enormous pressure and responsibilities.  Expectations remain high for each new instalment, especially at its 50th anniversary.  Unfortunately, the end result is terribly disappointing film with a weak, disjointed and poorly written storyline, disregarding the rave reviews and sky hype.<br />Supposedly this is a retro-Bond, to hark back to the original Bonds by Sean Connery.  The film makers seek out the Oscar winning director Sam Mendes to helm the film based on the script by 3 credited writers.  The end result showed the multi-hands.<br />The title sequence remains good.<br />The first set piece which lasted over 10 mins was exciting and well-executed but recalled sequences from the Bourne series.<br />The next sequence was the assassination at night time in Shanghai that dazzled but resembled Mission Impossible series.<br />Then came the sequence on the Macau Dragon Boat Casino with lanterns, Komoto dragons, cardboard oriental henchmen/villains and oriental-looking women in heavy makeup where Bond met his first Bond girl who died shortly afterwards.<br />This sequence recalls the old Hollywood musical \\"The Flower Drum Song\\" which this time around looked tiring and politically incorrect.<br />Next came the introduction of the chief villain played by Javier Bardem who tried to inject some blood into his role but was disabled by the writers and director who modeled him from Hannibal Lector.<br />The highly anticipated finale was a huge letdown:  Bond and M escaped(Bond escapes?) to his birth estate in the Scottish highland and got hunt down by the chief villain and his mates.  This overlong set piece of the siege of the lone estate is so old that's needless to mention.<br />As for the Bond girls, there're only 2!  One became the new Money Penny who's supposed to be a sharp shooter but hardly looked believable.  The other was the short-lived Dragon Boat girl.  Sorry guys!<br />Instead, too much time was spent on Judi Dench who played M while Daniel Craig looked worn out and tired.<br />Let's hope the next Bond revives.o played M while Daniel Craig looked worn out and tired.<br />Let's hope the next Bond revives.

B009SIE6AA|5.0|I have always been a fan of James Taylor so when I saw his new Christmas album, I seriously HAD to have it! I knew I would like it but oh my gosh-I had no idea how much I would LOVE it. His version of &#34;Jingle Bells&#34; is freakin awesome! I am so excited about this album-I would suggest this to anyone searching for new Christmas music and of course for the James Taylor fans. This is a new favorite of mine!

B004EKCNMA|5.0|I loved this film but I would NOT suggest it for anyone under the age of 6 or 7. This movie is dark, deep and seriously scary. It is quite a bit more serious than any other Christmas Carol film I have ever seen (including Scrooged). It does have it's fun and silly moments (even though they are few and far between) but death is portrayed in a very real and serious way. I would suggest that a parent watch it first and decide whether or not your child can handle it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|love the crescendo option!!! waking up like it is on my own instead of something blarring in my ears, startling me awake.
B005S9EK1S|5.0|I am a fan of Nicholas Sparks but my gosh, I was wondering when the couple would actually live to love each other. I couldn't take anymore...well, death. Let the couple live for the love of God! I loved this movie, although I still have not read the book.  I am pregnant and of course...emotional, but took a chance on this film and I am happy I did. I even found it on Amazon (black Friday week) on bluray for $3.99! When I received it, I put it in my stocking as a gift to myself.

B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Bruno Mars' second major label release \\"Unorthodox Jukebox\\" is aptly titled as the musical styles are all over the place and that is a good thing. He taps his inner early '80's Prince on \\"Gorilla\\", mid 70's Elton John on \\"When I Was Your Man\\", late 70's disco on \\"Treasure\\", reggea on \\"Show Me\\" and a whole lotta modern day Bruno on everything else. This is a great listen from start to finish, which is rare these days. Just squeaking in under the wire, but \\"Unorthodox Jukebox\\" is one of the best albums of 2012, and will certainly be huge in 2013.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I played this CD one time for my 5th grade class, and they were instantly hooked. If they are independently working, they often request to have the CD played again. The really cool connection, my class performed a music concert where they created music using different objects. I showed them the youtube video to Cello Wars, and they thought it was awesome how so many sounds came from one instrument!<br /><br />Thanks for creating music that CAN be played in our schools!
B00005LOUP|2.0|Take one Dr. Seuss book, add some elements of the animated motion picture, then throw in a lot of extra scenes designed to illustrate just how lonely the Grinch is, and despite Seuss's request to \\"please don't ask why, no one quite knows the reason\\" let's add his life story from birth, add some bullying in school that drove him away, and what blockbuster would be complete without a love story?!  So let's make him loveable despite his attempts to drive people away.  Since he was bullied before, it stands to reason he'll still be bullied in town, so let's throw that in too.  But it should be a kid's movie too, so let's make Cindy Lou-Who the star of the movie that saves the day.<br /><br />Add it all up and you have this movie, a star-powered holiday family movie mess.  So much has been added to the original story that the original story is almost lost.  The Christmas spirit that Seuss (Theodore Geisel) was attempting to explain to children is not about presents, trimmings, boxes, or bags, it's about giving and about caring.  Though Cindy Lou's character attempts to bring this into focus, I struggle with whether this rendition is more about Grinch or Cindy Lou, and whether the topic is about Christmas or about what happens to people who are bullied.<br /><br />Perhaps many of these scenes should have been dropped in editing and left for the Deleted Scenes section of the bonus features, but the new material seems to stop the story rather than enhance the experience.
B0076L9W9Q|4.0|I loved the first Halestorm album and have listened to it start to finish dozens of times. I was very pleased to pick up their second offering, which is of comparable quality. There are definitely some moments that really show off the dynamic range of tones and colors that Lzzy can hit. However, there are a couple tracks that I often skip as they are a little too much of the same thing for me. I really enjoyed some of the slower tracks as they offered a good variety...and a better opportunity to showcase Lzzy's voice. Personally, I enjoy the first album from start to finish more...but this is still a good addition to my library.
030758836X|5.0|There are over four thousand customer reviews here at amazon for this book so I don't think I need to rehash the plot as that is amply covered here.  I do understand why there are so many reviews and why this is a HUGE bestseller and has already been optioned for a movie by Reese Witherspoon (who would be terrific as Amy, the lead woman). What makes this book so timely is that everything bad that could happen to this once golden couple has happened and it mirrors the bad things going on in America at large. They both lost their jobs in Manhattan working for upscale magazines.  Her trust fund was wiped out by her parents' bad investments. Their brownstone is lost.  They must move to a suburb of foreclosed houses in Mark Twain country (Missouri). All the jobs are wiped out there ever since this giant mall closed.  It couldn't get any worse, right?<br /><br />Well, of course it could and this is what pins the reader to the page.  Not only does the American dream backfire but it crosses over into noir pulp land.  This is the typical warring husband and wife of pulp noir fiction American style but there is nothing else typical about it.  Kudos to the author for incredible inventiveness.  I can't say more as the twists in the plot and characters is what makes it.

B008XX6J4C|5.0|This is beautiful music - my kind of classical! Good covers of popular songs, too. I'm quite certain these talented gentlemen could make \\"Chopsticks\\" sound amazing. I enjoy listening to this album whether I'm working or relaxing, it's just good music! Check YouTube for The Piano Guys videos, and then buy this album so you can keep their music with you wherever you are!
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|I bought two of these from Amazon and they are perfect for my use.  I installed one in my den/computer room, and one in my utility room where I just need to slip on my shoes while I step outside with the dogs several times a day.  My utility room has no windows, so this is the only way to go!  I just shut off the one in my computer room during the day, and turn it to 'auto' at night, because it seems like I am always popping in and out of that room at night!<br />Kay in Bremerton, WA
B0012IWHDW|4.0|Even with Coburn, Kristofferson and Dylan, the Movie was slow and boring.  But the Dylan background music was great.<br /><br />I did not give it 5 stars, only because the only really strong vocal song on it is the killer &#34;Knocking on Heaven's Door.&#34;  For any other musician, this would have been a 5 star.  But in comparison to Dylan's huge catalog of superb music, this would only rate 4 stars.<br /><br />But anyone who is a big Dylan fan should have this album to round out their collection.  Besides the big hit, it has a lot of really excellent instrumental tracks.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is a brilliantly conceived and executed series that well merits the kudos it has earned. Well worth the time.
B005LAII6C|1.0|The 3d is awful  especially considering anime really shows off the media.  I Robot jumps off the screen compared to this production.  The story itself is totally geared towards 8 yr olds but the innuendo makes it very very marginal even for todays kids.  The script is really boring.  I will stop here because I have run out of nice things to say about this movie.  I did not buy this from Amazon but I am a big fan, I got it today from a local brick and mortar store with coupons  I would really be upset if i paid $25 or $ 30 for this trash.
B00AA7O22U|1.0|The action is well handled. The actors show that in the wrong movie, they cannot carry a weak script. Chuck Norris stood out for playing off the sense of humor that he's justly famous more.

B000SEVVLK|4.0|Author: Lauren Weisberger<br />Rating: 3.75 out of 5 Stars <br />Genre: Chick Lit.<br />Format: Print  - EBook<br />Publisher: Simon and Schuster<br />Publish Date: 2008<br /><br />****THERE ARE NO SPOILERS****<br /><br />SYNOPSIS: The bestselling author of \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" and \\"Everyone Worth Knowing\\" returns with the story of three best friends who vow to change their entire lives...and change them fast. Emmy is newly single, and not by choice. She was this close to the ring and the baby she's wanted her whole life when her boyfriend left her for his twenty-three-year-old personal trainer -- whose fees are paid by Emmy. With her plans for the perfect white wedding in the trash, Emmy is now ordering takeout for one.<br /><br />Leigh, a young star in the publishing business, is within striking distance of landing her dream job as senior editor and marrying her dream guy. And to top it all off, she has just purchased her dream apartment. Only when Leigh begins to edit the enfant terrible of the literary world, the brilliant and brooding Jesse Chapman, does she start to notice some cracks in her perfect life...<br /><br />Adriana is the drop-dead-gorgeous daughter of a famous supermodel. She possesses the kind of feminine wiles made only in Brazil, and she never hesitates to use them. But she's about to turn thirty and -- as her mother keeps reminding her -- she won't have her pick of the men forever. Everyone knows beauty is ephemeral and there's always someone younger and prettier right around the corner.<br /><br />These three very different girls have been best friends for a decade in the greatest city on earth. As they near thirty, they're looking toward their future...but despite all they've earned -- first-class travel, career promotions, invites to all the right parties, and luxuries small and large -- they're not quite sure they like what they see...<br /><br />One Saturday night at the Waverly Inn, Adriana and Emmy make a pact: within a single year, each will drastically change her life. Leigh watches from the sidelines, not making any promises, but she'll soon discover she has the most to lose. Their friendship is forever, but everything else is on the table. Three best friends. Two resolutions. One year to pull it off.<br /><br />Review: First of all, I love novels that carry multiple main characters. They are harder to write, that is certain, than novels that carry a single main character. So when I read the back cover of this novel, I was instantly skeptical and hopeful. Second of all, I LOVE Lauren Weisberger. The Devil Wears Prada is one of my favorite chick lit novels and Everyone Worth Knowing is another novel that I thoroughly enjoyed. So, of course, when this author has another book out, I have to give it a try!<br /><br />So what did I love? I love that Lauren Weisberger has strong, independent women as her characters. She purposefully creates protagonists that are not waiting around, twiddling their thumbs, waiting for prince charming to come around. I love chick lit, but sometimes I find the \\"I'm so depressed because I'm 30 and I haven't found my soul mate yet so I'm gonna wallow\\" routine extremely irritating. So, I appreciate that the women in this novel are strong and successful in their own right.<br /><br />The relationship between the women and their situations seemed real. For once, I read a novel and thought, yes these three best friends have been each others back but still have feelings of occasional jealousy, annoyance and irritation of one another. They seemed very real. Also, I appreciated the fact that the women, at the end, did not have the perfect happy ever after. Now, I must admit that I am a #1 proponent of happily ever after/sweet sugar sappiness/ butterflies/all other girly endings that could possibly happen. However, I will say that in the case of this book, the ending fits the novel.<br /><br />What I didn't care for: Following the other two novels that I really loved, I expected more from this book. The story line wasn't spectacular, heck, it wasn't exactly original, but it was fun. The beginning started off quite slow which made me a bit concerned. I wasn't sure if the novel was going anywhere, and I was worried that the super slow pace would make me disinterested in finishing the book. Luckily, the novel picked up after a while and it ended up being a neat read. Also, the three girls seemed to be almost stock characters. Of the three girls, one is extremely promiscuous, one is extremely chaste, and one is right in the middle. I generally do not care for stock characters (unless its being done in an ironic or satirical way) so I wasn't overly impressed in that aspect of the writing.<br /><br />Final Thoughts: Overall, Chasing Harry Winston is a great summer beach read. It does not require a great amount of concentration, nor will it provide you with many surprises, but it is fun and it was definitely an enjoyable read. It preaches the age-old rule that if you don't look for love, then it certainly will find you - and I love those kinds of stories. The novel isn't just about looking for love; it's about the friendship of the women and how they relate to one another in times of excitement and heartbreak.d more from this book.

I generally do not care for stock characters (unless its being done in an ironic or satirical way) so I wasn't overly impressed in that aspect of the writing.<br /><br />Final Thoughts: Overall, Chasing Harry Winston is a great summer beach read. It does not require a great amount of concentration, nor will it provide you with many surprises, but it is fun and it was definitely an enjoyable read. It preaches the age-old rule that if you don't look for love, then it certainly will find you - and I love those kinds of stories. The novel isn't just about looking for love; it's about the friendship of the women and how they relate to one another in times of excitement and heartbreak.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|Beautiful, beautiful movie. Wonderful cast, great cinematography and music, Appropriate for teenagers as well. Very poignant mesages of love, destiny, fate, and spiritual connection.
B005974CNA|5.0|One of the best bands ever. not their best CD, but a good one nonetheless. I really miss MP behind the drums, but He's well represented.
B000001EXR|4.0|This is going to be a relatively short review because most KISS fans know the backstory on this one (and for those of you who don't, I'll fill you in.)<br /><br />Following the success of Ace and Peter's \\"surprise\\" appearance on [[ASIN:B000001EIA Unplugged]], plans quickly came together for a full-scale reunion of the original members, including makeup. That means it was time for Gene and Paul to say goodbye to Eric (temporarily) and Bruce (permanently). Rather than pound out one more commercial album, typical of the Kulick era (with the possible exception of the harder [[ASIN:B000001FZP Revenge]]), the boys chose to extinguish the flame with a dark, heavy, rocking album that...let's not kid ourselves here...is blaantly cut from the Soundgarden template.<br /><br />That said, I'd rather hear KISS rock in any format than hear them croon a sugary pop confection like \\"Forever\\" (co-written by Paul and Michael Bolton, from [[ASIN:B000001FQQ Hot in the Shade]]).<br /><br />The Soundgarden thing wears thin after 60 minutes, but how many GREAT...front-to-back...KISS albums can you name? After [[ASIN:B000001EL1 Alive!]] and [[ASIN:B000001EL3 Destroyer]], what's left? Great SONGS scattered across the landscape, but not a lot of great ALBUMS.<br /><br />The band closes things out with a rarity...the only Kulick-era song with Bruce on lead vocals. It's kind of interesting...more Soundgarden, to be sure, but with some moody John Lennon-esque vocals.<br /><br />It's easier to review this album in hindsight because Gene and Paul clearly had no intention of following up on the momentum created...all eyes were on Peter and Ace (even though Ace only played guitar on TWO SONGS on 1998's [[ASIN:B00000AFDW Psycho Circus]]).<br /><br />It's only rock and roll, but I like it. Not enough to give it five stars, but enough to give it four.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Mr. Connelly continue to write interesting novels about crimes and criminals but this one illustrated how Harry dilegence and dedication pay off in solving an old crime.  Interesting how Harry uses the clues to finally track down the killer.  Loved the book!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This coming from a Neuro doctor who knows the\\"ins and outs\\"of the brain is very convincing.  So much that he lost me a couple of times with his medical inputs.  I think it's wonderful how he found the after life but would have liked to have seen more biblical proof to the whole experience.

B000FC130E|5.0|I don't know why but this book had a rather profound effect on me. I've read it several times and it still comes out the same way. I guess I've had dreams that were like this, but it's an amazing read.

0689835604|5.0|A christmas gift for my grandaughter. I had it before for my grandson and it was a big hit. Babies love this book.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have every book written by John Grisham and love all of them. He can tell a story like nobody else. He keeps you trying to figure out the story as you go along.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love my facebook. I enjoy being able to connect with my facebook friends on my kindle. I totally love it
B0076DELIG|5.0|I like the way the way he writes.  I read it in two days.  I know all the characters from his previous books.
B007KFZ7RE|5.0|Nick puts out some nice tunes and jams, a not really newcomer to the music scene but he doesn't get a lot of play on mainstream radio, at least where I live! I found him through a Thanksgiving music special on TV, he was jamming with a bunch of old rockers who had invited him to play. It was an awesome sound so I jumped right onto Amazon to order. Nick's sound is kind of retro rocker, bluezy, souful. Check him out!
B008EZVNFE|5.0|Amazing talent. The writing, lyricism and delivery have kept me (and my ten-year old daughter) smiling, singing and dancing around the house since the first soulful notes. I highly recommend this wonderful artist, and wish her a long, healthy and fruitful career.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|This kit does exactly what it is supposed to do.  Has worked perfectly throughout my recent vacation allowing me to evaluate photos as I went along.
0345803485|1.0|This is possibly the worst book ever!!!! It was slow and the writing was equal to a high school student.  I could not finish this book because I could not stop rolling my eyes.  I can not believe the rave about this book I'm so disappointed.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Well, the first movie was incredible, capturing much of the essential spirit and some of the details of Frank Miller's Dark Knight without reproducing that storyline.  The second movie was awesome, although Batman seemed to take a bit of a backseat to the Joker, a performance that deserves to be legendary.  So I was a little leery of a third movie.  How could they possibly match the quality of the prior two?  Well - kudos to Chris Nolan and the huge number of people who made this triquel (i just made that up) the BEST of the three, while tying into the previous two movies.  There is much about this film that makes it timely and relevant, and I'll be up front, i found it incredibly moving as well as entertaining.<br /><br />They certainly left plenty of room for yet another movie, and if they keep up this quality, I will be in the front row.  As it was, I didn't even know it was out until after it was released to video so I just bought the blu-ray trilogy, hoping I would like it.<br /><br />This is a thinking person's batman, with plenty of action to boot.  It has depth and breadth.  If you have a brain and enjoyed the prior two, I cannot recommend this movie enough.  I'd give it ten stars if I could.
B009JBZH54|5.0|If you haven't seen all three of them then you need this.  If you have seen all three of them then you want this.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|For free. Are you kidding?  Consider the $ spent. Free doesn't get better than this.  Great and easy to use app!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Easy to use app, it is visually well-organized and appealing. The updating the home page is easy and never freezes.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|This was by far my favorite movie as a child. I just recently got a 3D TV and Blu-ray player so as soon as this came out I ordered it. The shipping was fast and free, as great as ever. While watching it so much as a child I had essentially memorized the whole movie. When I first put the 3D version in I was instantly blown away with the detail and impressive 3D effect that even the title menu had been given. The whole movie all the way through impressed me with how well it had been redone in 3D.<br /><br />This is an overall great movie, from the plot to the graphics. A great buy with a solid 5-stars for everything included.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Good read. Left me with questions, but enjoyed his story.  Quite affecting and reassuring.  I highly recommend it to you.
B002L3ARRU|5.0|Downloaded for the Kindle. My son loves this movie! The price was right and the quality of the movie is great!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Purchssed both previous novels after resding Gone Girl.  Enjoyed all of them very much and look forward to her next book.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I brought the dvd version instead the blu-ray. It is totally worth the price. If you want to watch the special feature, it is not in this version.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Bought this after reading Gone Girl and absolutely loved it.  So very different and an enjoyable read. Can't wait for Gillian Flynn to write her next one.
B003XT603Q|4.0|After reading his \\"What I talk about...\\" I knew I had to read his books. Didn't which to start with though. Without knowing anything about any of them I picked Norwegian Wood and I'm glad I did.<br />It's amazing how immersed you get in his universe - even after only a few lines.<br />I've read some criticism of Toru being an empty shell that meets lots of different characters. I don't think it's entirely fair as this lets you meet these characters on your terms.<br />Docked a star for the IMO a little frustrating ending.<br /><br />All in all, very recommended!
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I Definitely would recommend this show to anyone. Must have in anyone's DVD collection. Can't wait for the next seasons
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is still the master of the political action thriller genre.  He doesn't disappoint with his latest Mitch Rapp novel.  Back to current times, Rapp finds himself in a crisis after one of the CIA's top operatives in the war on terror is kidnapped in Afghanistan.  Its a race against time to find him before the USA's most important secrets and spy network is divulged.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the plot, so I won't say anymore.  If you are a fan of the Mitch Rapp series, The Last Man won't disappoint.  If you are new to the series, you will be hooked.
B00A0A6F7C|5.0|Even though she is accompanied by other people on 3-4 of the songs, she carries them all to a higher & more professional level. She is so deserving of any amount of appreciation!
1849904251|5.0|Though it was a bit pricier than expected, the casebook was still a wonderful read. Lots of information from both the characters' perspectives, as well as meta information and commentary.
B004SKIPXW|5.0|This movie has alot of action in it and comes with both 3d and 2d dvds. The 3d is ausomme on on some parts of the movie, not so good on others, for the most part the 3d is great and the action high end.
0439882826|5.0|This book is so much fun to look at. I'm not a Star Wars fan like my 7 year old, but I am getting a kick out of the book just the small. THe last pop of Darth Vader is the best.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn at his best.  Mitch Rabb should hook up with Jack Reacher.  The Last Man was enjoyable from page one.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like playing Flow Free.  My grandson recommended it to me.  Thanks for the free gameI like keeping my brain going.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|The DVD is just what I wanted. It came on time. The dvd was well packaged. Good buy. I would order again.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Absolutely love this! You start to read and you just can't stop! Howey builds immediate relationships between reader and characters. Their feelings are yours-their plights are yours. Wonderful!
B008QOH1NG|4.0|It's not one of the greatest Stryper presentation, but it worths to have it, for sure. Sound is just 2.0, but is very good.
B00683EY96|5.0|Well written with wonderful messages about life. I enjoyed this book very much. I am recommending it to my closest friends and have purchased several copies as gifts.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|... would not look as nice as my kindle. I love this cover. It's well made, sturdy, and feels nice to the touch. It's easy to fold to cover back and stand the Kindle up to view it horizontally, if I so desire, and it's handy to fold it back while I'm reading and surfing. The cover's texture does not feel like real leather, but I've found that it is more resistant to scratches and nicks than real leather would be. The gold design is pretty and antiqued a bit for a more authentic look, and the inside of the cover is soft microfiber, so it helps to protect the screen as it should. I use the folder pocket to hold the backup screen protector and a microfiber cleaning cloth. I like that the cover makes the Kindle look like any other book on my book shelf -- a nice way to disguise the book if necessary. I highly recommend this cover for the Kindle Fire. If you like the look of classic books and journals, you can't go wrong.
B000YHE4AG|4.0|Its great to watch at Christmas time. Kids love it to, its crazy. I watch it every year. Plan to watch it with my Brother on Christmas.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|this game is very fun and adorable. I love the Corgis and I think my real dog is jealous of them. they are the cutest little babes ever.
B008G59IBI|3.0|Uno started of OK but quickly became boring, Dos was great right from the get-go, Tre is a letdown. It was billed as the arena rock album but in reality is an album where the slow numbers shine and the rockers fail. I can't imagine Green Day playing these tracks live a whole bunch in the future. It seems an album made up of what was left over from the other albums. My guess is they've pulled out two albums worth of tracks that go together and what was left is served here. The problem here is most of what's been served up doesn't cut it. Many of the songs come and go and you don't even notice them.<br /><br />(B+) - Brutal Love is the highlight of the album. It's almost a straight rip off of several other songs including The Beatles' Oh Darling. Also close to the formula of Oh Love (including the `copy the tune' guitar solo) and is similarly a tad overlong. I like it though, however!!<br />(C+) - Missing You is OK but only good filler<br />(C) - 8th Avenue is standard filler<br />(B+) - Drama Queen is a slower number one of the better tracks though perhaps a tad disturbing...<br />(B+) - X-Kid is the best of the `rockers' and a definite highlight<br />(C+) - Sex, Drugs and Violence is a bit of nothing<br />(C) - A Little Boy Named Train keeps the nothing going<br />(C+) - Amanda solidifies the run of nothing. It's no Amy but maybe on par with Ashley.<br />(B+) - Walk Away picks things up and is one of the few highlights.<br />(C) - Dirty Rotten Bastards surely can't be taken seriously. Just too many rip-offs of other songs for me to like this one. Carmen? and Marine's Hymn or is it Auld Lang Syne?<br />(C) - 99 Revolutions brings us back to a nothing song. Identical start to Lazy Bones but is nowhere near the quality.<br />(C+) - The Forgotten is OK (there's a lot of just OK stuff here) but not up there with their best ballads. It doesn't really go anywhere<br /><br />So unfortunately, at the end of the three albums my fears have been realised - that there's only really one album worth of great material. You could argue two good albums worth of tracks but what would be the point of releasing two? It needed to be three or one but the three hasn't really cut it. Good on them for having a go and I doubt many others could have done better.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Racketeer was another very exciting book to read.  I have read all of John Grisham's books and this one is right up there near the top.
B000J3OTTQ|1.0|I was so excited that you had this dvd, but when it arrived and I started to watch it the beginning 5 minutes of the dvd kept freezing or was bouncy. I wish you could have replaced it with another.. Still a good movie.. Thanks!!

B005LAII12|2.0|My 18 yr old saw this at the theater and came home raving about it. So I pre-ordered it for him.  Just watched it.....<br /><br />It was the most tedious movie ever. And TED was no more that Peter from Family Guy in teddy bear form. Just more gross. The writing was so so and the plot seemed all over the place.<br /><br />If you must see it, wait for HBO to show it.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Hachi: A Dog's Tale will tug at your heart strings. If you like real movies about real people you will love this one especially if you love dogs.

0307346617|5.0|Excellent book, arrived just when stated, I read it in days and already loaned it out. Sigh...looks like I'll be ordering another copy...
B005F3DFXG|5.0|This only works on my all region orie blu ray player. It will not work on my regular blu ray player. So you probably need a all region blu ray player like mine to watch this one. This is the best dinosaur program that is now out. It uses the current most and recent finds and information to give a world wide view of dinosaurs. It's done with computer generated effects and it's a outstanding piece of work. Juhn Hurt does a great job of narrating this one. And it does have subtitles. It's not on blu ray in the u.s. so I had to get this version. The u.s. has a dvd version which is the same but not in hd.  There is also a 3d version which has one or two episodes of this series on it. This also contains the bbc show 'building a dinosaur' which is not in hd and not cconnected to this series at all. Instead it was a show that aired on the bbc a few years back. It's about the Los angelos museum of natural history and their remodeling and the building of their dinosaur exibit. The 3d version (not in this package) and this is certianly region 2 or b only. And it doesn't have the whole tv series at all. One must wonder why bbc american did not show this tv series here. What a big mistake!.  The science here is top notch and the effects are from this era. As opposed to even ten years ago. Leave it to the bbc to do another great dino series, after all they changed everything with their walking with dinosaurs show in 2000!. If you hava a all region player get this one, if not buy the dvd version , it's just a great tv series for the whole family.

B007FG9LIE|4.0|I had a good time reading this book! The plot is pretty all over the place but in a good way. The strangeness of it all keeps you turning the pages, and I was barely able to put the book down.<br /><br />Blake Crouch's imagination is crazy. He has a great ability to put insanity together. In Pines, he built a strange blend of contemporary thriller and paranormal adventure.<br /><br />When a Secret Service agent goes looking for his missing friends, he finds himself in a situation very different from anything he's ever experienced... with no way out. Odd things are happening in this town, things he cannot explain. With chilling intent, he tries to discover the secrets of the inhabitants, only to be stopped at every turn by an imposing, sadistic sheriff or the staff at hospital.

Regardless of how he behaves or what actions he takes, they will always be to his detriment, because he will always return to them. Not a bad song beat wise.<br /><br />Locked Out of Heaven - The first single off [[ASIN:B009IRVSVQ Unorthodox Jukebox]]. I'm still not sure how I feel like this song, because it has inundated its mark on the radio, so it's been a little overexposed to me. But again it's about Bruno's vulnerability to the female species. It takes a strong man to bear and acknowledges his weaknesses.<br /><br />Gorilla - I was immediately intrigued at the very beginning of this song, and as it went on I became a little bit surprised. I appreciate the risks that this man is taking, and it's only track #3. He references a lot of things in this song such as love, sex, alcohol and drugs. This entire song could be a huge analogy about some of the things that have happened to him immediately after he blew up with his first album, but I really want to commend him on this song.<br /><br />Treasure - Very reflective of an old school style with great production. Also reminiscent of something Jamiroquai might even have put out. He sings about putting his woman/potential mate on a pedestal; that she should be pampered and feel special. I really like this song, and I think this will be popular among the female crowd. A short and sweet song.<br /><br />Moonshine - Production is great on this song as well, and it is different than the previous songs. This song did not immediately grab me, but I'm still going to give it a chance.<br /><br />When I Was Your Man - Bruno soulfully sings about the missed opportunity to reclaim a loved lost. With just him and a piano, he sings of hurt and regret about seeing the girl he should have apologized to and treated better with another man. So he just hopes that that man can fulfill the things that he couldn't when they were together. A very good song.<br /><br />Natalie - With this song he goes away from the chivalrous songs and sings about a harlot who steals his money while bragging about it at the same time. It's definitely a different side of Mr. Mars. He basically proclaims revenge if he ever finds her. It's really an intoxicating song, and one I know will be on repeat. What I especially like are the instruments that I hear in this song that aren't customarily used a lot lately, at least in today's pop songs. A well done song.<br /><br />Show Me - A very mellow, lazy-like song you can imagine hearing outside with the bright sun out while you're relaxing in the shade. That is the imagery I immediately saw upon hearing this song. The island influences sure didn't hurt at all. You can tell he had a lot of fun with this song. One of my favorites.<br /><br />Money Make Her Smile - This is such a slick song to me. I don't know how to explain it, but I just love this song.<br /><br />If I Knew - Direct references of Motown influences are apparent in this song. This song is something everyone can relate to - about initiating a different reaction if you knew information prior to what you did. That if only you can take back things, or done things differently. Very short and to the point song.<br /><br />I think a lot of people were worried about how Bruno Mars was going to perform when it came to his second album. He was such a surprise for many and a success with his freshman album, as well as when he assisted many artists with their own music efforts, but would that formula serve well for himself the second go round? I say yes! This is a solid album from him production wise, as well (and maybe more importantly) lyric and vocal wise. I don't think it usurps his last one, but it doesn't have to. He has grown as an artist in such a short time, which will prove to aid in his longevity when it comes to the music industry. I cannot wait to see what else he comes with.y good song.<br /><br />Natalie - With this song he goes away from the chivalrous songs and sings about a harlot who steals his money while bragging about it at the same time.

B00ADIT8U2|1.0|no hints. no special effects no directions. what a waste of money. it should at least let you know why your at the house. and what your purpose there is. kind of keeps you in the dark.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|loved the writing so full of details...read all three books quickly. hard to put down. will reread i am sure.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I thought this was gonna be just like Angry Birds but it is not and I actually like it! I think it is creative and fun!!
B0053O89U6|5.0|Cheap Price. Great Quality. Quick Shipment. What more could you want? Well it could have been free but that would be a little silly!
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|I love the Pendergast series of books by Preston and Child and I would probably rate the read as 4 stars!  Unfortunately, like some other Kindle E-Books, the publisher decided not to allow this e-book to be lendable. That means you cannot \\"lend\\" the e-book to another Kindle user. I find this irritating, since I feel an e-book should at least allow me the opportunity to share it to some degree. Otherwise, it is a \\"read-once and forget about it\\" purchase. I, personally, will not purchase e-books that are not lendable. If nothing else, be aware of the policy before you buy. I give a one-star rating for the lending policy for the e-book product.<br /><br />Note; I edited my review to be clearer that I loved the book, but hate the publisher's lending policy for the Kindle version. In response to some of the comments: If you don't care whether the e-book is lendable, that is fine -- I just figured there are others, like me, that might like to know this so they can decide if the Kindle version is right for them or not. If you don't know what to look for in the product description, it is easy to mistakenly assume that you would be able to lend the kindle version.
0143116053|5.0|I am not finished yet but am thoroughly enjoying this book.  Funny, whimsical, poignant.....so many emotions are loveingly laid out on each page.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The arrangements are so unique; there is a bit of everything from classical to original. Simply beautiful. I listened to a couple on youtube and was instantly hooked. These are great for \\"in the background\\" music while I do my homework.
B0063GORYU|5.0|this game is awesome and it is just as good as solataire. it is a fun game and I recommend it too everyone.
B006OFN0BQ|1.0|Poor scrip,horrible acting, questionable veracity. Sorry I watched it, Nothing I have ever read ever supported the story. Example of &#34;do all you can to berate heroes of the past.&#34;
1451627297|5.0|I have read everything by Stephen King and love most...but I can objectively say this is completely un King Like. t is a love story, no horror involved and I am not one to cry but a got emotional at the last 10 pages. I lik to read but 800 plus pages is an undertaking and I couldnt wait every day to put in some time. This is a great book, not political, and time travel told very well. HIGHLY recommended as a different type of read.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|I'm prime so I didn't pay for this but I think I would have.  Great show.. great season.  Two more words requires? Blasphemy!
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|This album \\"Unorthodox Jukebox\\" is very enjoyable. In my opinion it is RIVALING the cleverness and originality to Lauryn Hill's album \\"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill\\".  This album will be enjoyed for years to come and Bruno Mars' name will go down in the books.  Possibly 4-6 grammy's.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|I guess it's obvious for the price that it wouldn't... but just pointing it out.  Either way my sister loves it because it holds the barbies and my nieces loves it because its almost like another toy.  Two birds... one stone.
B00AC8ZJPQ|2.0|I gave it 2 starts for the nice effects and animation, other than that its just crap.<br /><br />Not worth the money.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I haven't read very far in but every chance I get, I rush back to my Kindle to pick it up again.  As I read, I gain new understandings about a lot of the historical fragments that reside in my brain.
B00000IQW5|5.0|This is a super movie....air firefighting, comedy, and romance.....keep the hankies handy....I have watched this movie at least 10 times......REALLY, it is good!!<br />Hey guys, this is a guy movie also...about Air firefighters for forest lands...the flying scenes in this movie are breath holding....this is a male/female movie..
B0076DELIG|5.0|As always Connelly keeps you guessing til the end. One of those \\"can't put down\\" books!!  Enjoyed it from beginning to end!
B00A7CF1QY|4.0|Getting over Matt Damon's spell-binding performance as Jason Bourne is tough, so it may take a couple of installments of the series with Jeremy Renner to establish his persona.  With that stated, however, I liked the film.
0761171703|5.0|I was hanging out in Barnes and Noble and as a photographer, I always browse the photo books for inspiration and to feed that part of my heart. I saw this book on the shelf, grabbed it and read the entire thing in store, and as that constitutes falling in love for me, I came back two days later and bought it.<br /><br />If you love beauty, grace, joy in everyday circumstances and explosions of joy, do yourself a favor and buy this book, check out the website, like the Facebook page, and add a new dimension of awesome to your life.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book captured my interest from the beginning.  It was very easy to read, and moved along at a good pace. I am looking forward to reading the next two books to see how this all plays out.
B005UBNKZG|5.0|Highly recommended, very good product, exactly what I was expecting, good price and quality, thanks for your commitment and delivery time. 100% very satisfied with the product.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|This ap will suffice, but it's not as good as the pc or tablet versions.  Too hard to navigate to where you want to go.  Okay for emergencies.
0790731452|5.0|Absolutely hysterical!!  No matter how many times you've seen it, it always results in belly laughs!  And you can even watch in front of the kids.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I enjoyed this book tremendously all the way through and then WOW it ended so well it took my breath away.  I am going to give this as a gift to a few people this season and as soon as I catch my breath I'll probably read it again.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This was watched on Amazon instant video. Loved it came in clear and no skips. I would deff recommend this to anyone!
0425264351|5.0|Loved this book... so much in fact i bought the entire series from amazon and cant wait to begin reading. Lee Child should write another series like this with different people... i would read it.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Like the movie but lost intrest in it half way though. but Amazon did a great job though instant video!
B004G6009K|5.0|I've wanted to buy Tangled for awhile now, but I wanted it with a digital copy so I could take it on the go, and I finally purchased when I saw the digital copy/3D version come out! Love this movie, haven't tried the 3D disc out yet, but I'm sure it will be great! Great buy and I recommend it for any Disney fan!
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|Did great as using my first time on instant video. Although I lost interest in the movie half way though
B0061PEAUY|5.0|great book as always by kathy reichs and the ability to pre order is much appreciated! I've had this on order since April.

B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I like playing the game though I wish it were much more easier to get the paint looking points and the hearts. other than that overall its a very cute game.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Great book except that it's another cliffhanger. - Wish GRRM would pop them out a bit quicker.  Maybe it will come out when I retire.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I have read many of John Grisham's books. Some were very intriguing and others made me mad when I got closer to the end and told myself, &#34;that's it&#34;  no more of his books. Then I look at a new release and tell myself &#34;I'll give it another try. I'm not through reading this one yet so, I'll see how I like it as I get closer to the end.
1449410243|5.0|Ended up buying 3 copies and giving out some Oatmeal love.<br /><br />Everyone has thoroughly enjoyed it. Wish it could have been longer!
B007EECSFA|4.0|Very good book.  Kept the &#34;secret&#34; until the very end.  Wasn't what I expected.  Even more interesting as I read this as we traveled through Germany where there had been much devastation during the war and it seemed to fit right into our scenery.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I luv the pink bird she is so cute I have a shirt she has a bow and purple glasses best shirt I ever got
B00A8ECU24|5.0|very cute game. my daughter enjoys it. fun. don't have to spend extra money 2 eenjoy but can buy extra stuff if u want.
B009VB7QQA|5.0|Watch this movie,  it is a lot of fun and very well made,  nothing phoney about it,  everything is made believable,  a lot of action and awesome special effects,  watch it this weekend
B007IXWL2C|1.0|It is profane, poorly written, highly vulgar.  I am embarrassed that I bought it and would NEVER recommend it to anyone.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|We can do all thing through Christ, if we have accepted Him into our lives and put our trust in Him.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read all of the Mitch Rapp books and have enjoyed every one of them.  I saw some reviews that gave this book one star and couldn't believe it.  Reasons for one star range from a perceived increase in 'vulgar' language and a scene with a dog toward the end of the book ... the readers thinking that Mr. Flynn did not have to use such language or have the hero do what he did to the dog.  I look at this and see 'growth' in the character.  Rapp has been in his business for something like 20 years in this book, and I can imagine that after that amount of time in any job, not to mention someone who is working in clandestine operations, that person would become less patient and more syndical.  I don’t think Rapp is going to go around and say things like ‘Excuse me, would you mind putting down your gun and telling me all your secrets please?’<br /><br />Vince Flynn has done it again and continued to grow the Rapp character.  I enjoyed the book very much and cannot wait for the next book and/or see Rapp come to the silver screen.  If I do have a complaint it would be that paying $11.99 for the Kindle copy does seem rather high … but that does not reflect the quality of work that Mr. Flynn has done with this latest Rapp adventure.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|Arrived as promised, works just like the description says.  No problems (yet) with battery life.  Played about 10 rounds without any issues.
B0098460O4|5.0|I was hoping this c/d would be as good as their singing on Britian's Got Talent and they were even much better! I have it in my car c/d player and listen to it every time I am on the road. Charlotte's softer voice is a perfect fit for Jonathan's booming one. Before I purchased this c/d, my favorite was Caruso. Now, I have a bunch of favorites without anyone being the tops. It made a good part of my Christmas shopping easy as I bought six c/ds for gifts. I highly recommend this for anyone, even those that are not into operatic arias, as the singing comes through so beautifully. I can not wait for their next c/d!!!
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|U really should try this,. You will be extreamly suprised by wat you will find yourself doing.. My kids also love it and anything is worth trying out.
B006WQLH7G|2.0|Need rooted device to make this at all useful.  Firewall can't enable, etc.  I will try something else.<br /><br /> Without full advertised protection what is the point?
B009KKLQKO|2.0|The Beach Boys have always been one of my favorite groups. I was at their concert back in July and it was fantastic. However this DVD (in my opinion) does NOT give you the FEELING of being at a LIVE concert. It feels like you're watching a FILM of the concert that keeps jumping from one frame to the next. The picture keeps switching too quickly between the group on stage, then goes behind the group, then to the audience,then back on stage, etc. This keeps happening over and over at a rapid pace, making the viewer feel like he (or she) is only experiencing bits and pieces of the concert.<br /><br />The sound quality during the show (in my opinion) is a bit muffled and lacks bass. However at the very end when the credits are shown, the sound quality suddenly gets better. I'm wondering if the sound technicians tried to doctor the audio of the concert to make the film sound better, but ended up muffling the sound instead.<br /><br />We all know by now that this DVD is only an abridged version of the concert. Europe released a 2 DVD version of this show and combined the concert with the \\"Doin' It Again\\" DVD as the second disc. (Thank you Sonora Dick for this information. I was under the impression that this was more of the concert. I feel better now.)<br /><br />On the positive side (as I DO want to at least TRY to show some objectivity),we have the Beach Boys with their great harmony. They save the day when it comes to watching this DVD. In spite of the rapid picture frames and muffled sound, the harmony still shines through,giving us some enjoyment. I guess having this DVD is better than not having anything at all.<br /><br />Hopefully, whoever made this film will \\"Do It Again\\" and make it better the second time around. To the producers, if you ever (by any chance or miracle) read this review, how about releasing a DVD set of the ENTIRE \\"Royal Albert Hall\\" Concert (from London, Sept. 27) where the Beach Boys sang a whooping 61 songs!! (\\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" to have a DVD of THAT show? Go to [...] and read about it. Song sets from many of their other 2012 tours are also listed.)<br /><br />To sum it up,the MUSIC on this DVD is enjoyable despite (my opinion of) the sound and picture issues I discussed earlier. It's also the only available way for us experience the highlights of this great concert tour. So BUY IT and enjoy. Hopefully a better version  will be released in the future.
0123694965|5.0|A well-written and engaging book that, while focused on game design, provides insights far beyond the world of game design and is full of useful advice for anyone designing anything.<br /><br />The book guides the reader through the entire design process, starting with discussing the designer's ultimate objective (to create an experience); continuing through understanding the elements that comprise games, addressing the needs of players, exploring the fundamental types of game mechanics, developing game worlds; and concluding with how to deal with clients, how to pitch a game, and how games transform their audiences.<br /><br />Along the way, the author present a series of 100 \\"lenses\\" through which designers can focus on specific aspects of their design. Each lens provides a series of questions that help designers stay on track during the course of their design. The author also sells a card set called \\"A Deck of Lenses\\" which present these lenses with illustrations [...] The deck of lenses is also available as an smart phone/tablet app [...]<br />As I noted above, many of the concepts in this book can be applied to not only game design, but also provide insights that can be applied to other fields as well. I'm a big fan of Walt Disney Imagineering, and found that many of the design principles in this book are the same principles used by the Imagineers in the design of Disney theme parks. Based on the author's background (Jesse Schell is a former Imagineer), this wasn't too big a surprise, but I still find the parallels worth noting.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone working in the game industry, as well as anyone interested in design in general. You'll be glad you added this book to your library.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|Nice quality case especially for the low price. Stand is sturdier than I thought it would be. I love Amazon. I did almost  all  my Christmas shopping here.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It is simple to use. It gives me a warning when the juice is dangerously low. Highly recommendation to use it.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|good story, love matthew mc.  this is funny, sophisticated with good dry wit.  I'm very sure that you will love it
B007BDK3SS|5.0|There are 3 versions of this game and all of them are worth getting, but this one is  my favorite.<br /><br />If you've only tried the original version, give this one a shot.  It's completely different and the added jump feature makes it a lot more fun.
B0051MKNV8|5.0|This is an interesting flick, plenty of action, well done, love the actors, and that makes it worth watching a few times
B00004U45G|5.0|First and foremost, this is the best recording of a live performance I've ever heard (I'm 65 and have heard a lot). It's obvious to me that anything Kevin Shirley mixes is going to be top shelf (listen to Black Country Communion or Black Stone Cherry). Zep fans will understand how special this union of Jimmy Page and the Black Crowes was. The layering of multiple guitars gives the sound here unparalleled fullness. You'll recognize all the songs and I'm so pleased they included \\"In My Time of Dying\\" and \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\", my favorites. Every instrument in this mix can be heard and appreciated. Regrettable there wasn't a camera rolling during this all too short tour.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|The writer used a wide range of vocaburary which suit a English learner to read. I like the insight brought by a animal and religious scholar. I also like the &#34;favorite quote&#34; marked by Kindle.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Great intrigue, some romance, teen angst, jealousy and more. What is not to like? Good for curling up by a fire on a cold winter's night or a lazy day at the beach.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|already I started playing this today and I have 6 littlest pets and 2 houses and 1 pet vet .This game is awesome try it and buy it. It is free!!!!!!!!!!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Love this series. It's very addicting! Not the best writing...too much repetitive wording but awesome in all the right...and wrong ways!
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|Mila Kunis has become one of my favorite actoresses and since she is a star in this movie she is the reason for my high rating of this movie.

B009SMW9IW|5.0|tinsel and lights is one of those rare Christmas albums that you can enjoy any time of year, not just Christmas.  A few covers and some originals, wonderful voice and phrasing.

B0058YPGSY|5.0|Can't get enough of this series.  It's the best show ever made.  The only problem is that I can't stop watching it and then the season's over with!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I love all the songs and play it continuously.  I usually download songs to my ipod but decided I needed a CD for the house or car.  So glad I did -  This lady can sing!!
B0071XO8RA|3.0|I wanted to like this book because my sister-in-law who's an avid reader, highly recommended it. I was also excited about the rave reviews it was getting and wanted to be in on the little secret like everyone else.<br /><br />Boy, what a let down. Not only was the beginning painfully slow, there was so much agonizing and miniscule details spent on parts of the story that didn't really matter (stair climbing, water diving, etc.) The author has a nice way of laying out detail, but I felt that he did so in all the wrong places.<br /><br /> The characters were sorely underdeveloped. There were a lot of unanswered questions about the main character, and I also felt other people were thrown into the mix when it was convenient to the story. The reader was expected to feel some sort of emotional connection towards these people, especially under the dire circumstances, but I often found myself unmoved and uncaring.  The relationships between characters seemed forced and the main love story (if you can call it that) seemed mismatched and rushed.<br /><br />I gave the omnibus edition 3 stars because the plot was imaginative and the book did get interesting about halfway through. However, I cannot for the life of me figure out why so many people have given it 5 stars. It had the potential to be great, but it fell very short for a rating of that caliber.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I love this app, it saves me allot of time not having to sign on everytime I want to purchase something from Amazon. It's a quick simple and easy to use. Great app, no complaints.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Michael Connelly is my all time favorite mystery writer.  And &#34;Harry Bosch&#34; my favorite detective.  His character seems to have changed some as well as the interesting cases he followed.  I really liked the earlier books better......i.e.  Echo Park, The Last Coyote, Trunk Music, etc.I also like the story lines better.  He is still my favorite but this book was not a &#34;I can't put it down&#34; story.  I will remain faithful though.
068484267X|5.0|Frank McCourt was well deserving of the Pulitzer. This book was so gritty, real and inspiring to the point that it was magical. His prose, the way he tells his story as if he were sitting across from you, it just took me away.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really liked this book. It was fun and funny. Could have been more spicey, but it was a nice read. Keep up the good work!
B00005JLO2|5.0|This movie was recommended to me, but because of it's age, was not readily available at the Red Box! I have been passing it around to my friends and they also are giving it great reviews!
B003XKPPOU|3.0|the didital copy can not be used :( but the regular dvd works great :) my son has watched it over and over
B0052QXAEK|4.0|I am not a big fan of Vanessa Hudgens but this was a really need modern beauty and the beast story. The make-up was amazing, horrifyingly  beautiful. Mary-Kate Olsen looked great and I loved her character just wish she had more parts. Its really not as bad as what the critics say it is. It you are a beaty and the beast fan then you will like this move for sure.
B001PP9ALY|4.0|Angelina Jolie - what's not to like??? The action sequences are pretty good too. But mostly - it's all about Angie baby. lol
B004LWZWGK|1.0|Avoid purchasing at all costs.  It was a great movie but I refuse to buy a product which will not support iTunes.  They are not providing codes for iTunes, they are forcing you to stick with their awful poor quality solution in an attempt to cheap out.  As a paying customer I feel taken and cheated.  This will be the last time I purchase any movie until the death of UV.  LIVE LONG PIRACY!
0345803485|2.0|I am saddened that I wasted my time on this book. I looked up the reviews before reading it and I realized that it was a bit of a trashy story and not some great literary book and I was fine with that. Sometimes you're in the mood for that kind of reading. I can see how the main female character is a bit weak, but as that is how the author wanted her to be, fine. It would be a different book if she wasn't.<br /><br />The two things that irked me the most were the reduncy-don't know how many times I read Ana say to herself, \\"Oh my\\" every time he gets near her. Second, a ton of space was used for the reading of the \\"contract\\" and \\"rules\\". Ok, I get that those needed to be in there for the story, but huge sections if not the whole thing were repeated I believe once in the same chapter and then once again toward the end of the book...it was a way to fill more pages without the writer actually working. They could have easily referenced the contract and then said when she looked at it again, she noticed section whatever was modified this way, and it would have taken a paragraph or less.<br /><br />The part that pissed me off the most is that by my definition, a book/story has a beginning, middle, and an end. That is writing 101 (or probably less). Book 1 does not have an end in any way shape or form. It just drops in the middle of the story, no conclusion. It is clear that if you want to find out the rest of the story, you need to buy the 2nd book. I am not against purchasing a 2nd book if I enjoy the first and I want more of the story. I get that, I have read several series and I am fine with multiple books. But each book needs to wrap up somewhere and this one didn't.<br /><br />I will not be buying the 2nd or 3rd books simply on principle that based on the \\"ending\\" of book one, the use of repeated phrases to fill pages, the use of repeated sections that are a couple pages long to fill pages-it appears both the author and her publisher presume their readers to be mindless idiots who won't notice. I did notice and it shows me that they have no respect for their reader and they will not be getting any more of my hard earned $$ for this story, regardless of the fact that I was actually enjoying the story-line despite these things.
B0062P3392|4.0|very good action movie with a good plot and story line.the details of the movie have been described by others,so i'll just say.jason statham is the new action figure to watch.i gave up on steven seagal several years ago.so it's great to see a movie with lot's of action,major actors and a story line you can follow.buy it,money well spent.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This phone case is amazing!  I final decided to spend the money after my phone feel in the toilet out of my back pocket.  I was able to salvage the phone, however did not want to take the chance again.  I was able to take under water videos of my babies first time in the pool this past summer and under water pictures.  It took a little getting use to the screen cover, however it's worth it knowing that my phone is safe.  Especially with little ones around.  Great Product and worth the money!!!
B000XA5K48|4.0|another good action movie i added to my collection a while back.a lot of viewers didn't like it at all.it's funny in a way,to go along with killer action,car chases and you name it.but don't take anyones review seriously.watch it yourself and decide.i liked the movie gigli,and nearly everyone else hates it.go figure.
B005HJU7HA|4.0|If you like mystery, and suspense, then you will like this book. All the stories draw you in and make you feel as if you're there helping to solve the case.

B001VPJYZK|5.0|Started watching it a couple years ago and decided to start at the beginning and found them at the best price here!
B002W5UVSM|5.0|I have not quite finished this book but I find it fascinating. I came upon it accidentally and must say, I think I was intrigued after reading that the author had committed suicide and then posthumously won a Pulitzer prize. What a great loss. John Kennedy Toole obviously had much talent and who knows what potentially could have been written by him. The book is funny, touching, and downright bizarre at times. I am already sure I will be wanting more when the end of the book comes.<br />Very bizarre way to end. Seems some of the backstory in the book was not ever completed, left me wondering what was the purpose of some of the characters.<br />Still a very good book.
0307887898|2.0|I should begin by sharing my general disdain for business books - all of which tend to run off into something we've all heard/read before - or something that us practitioners recognize from a good/bad day at the office but nothing that will change the temperature.<br />I had higher hopes for Mr. Ries's The Lean Startup. Unfortunately, the outcome is yet another in a long list of forgettable \\"must-read\\" \\"game-changing\\" books about one entrepreneur's pathway to authordom.<br />I suppose all the books in Amazon cannot neither guarantee success nor provide a yellow-brick road to prosperity, but if you are marketing a book titled \\"The Lean Startup\\" you probably should begin by trimming the unnecessary and non-productive anecdotal re-tellings of one man's experience. Of course if Mr. Ries had done that we would have a pamphlet, not a book.<br />Nonetheless, we did come away with a page of notes and adages that we can use for our next presentation if not for a blueprint on actually starting a venture - and most of that was in the introduction.<br />If there was any scientific applications detailed in this book, I must have missed them as I nodded off during the fourth or fifth go-round about Mr. Ries venture (which btw, I never heard of).<br />Lean startups are taking place all over these days as aspiring entrepreneurs who have the determination to succeed find a way. There are actually many different pathways towards this goal, but if \\"innovation accounting\\", \\"validated learning\\", or \\"build, measure, learn\\" make you feel smarter, than go for it! Besides, these phrases will make great new boxes on your Business Buzzword Bingo chart. Mr. Ries opines that \\"everything is a experiment\\"; that would indicate that it's back to the word processor for providing any meaningful insights into The Lean Startup.

B008RZF2I0|5.0|Love this one, yet another fantastic CD from this group!  They just seem to get better and better with each release.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|If you were expecting something at the level of his first 3or 4 novels you will be totally disappointed. It almost seems that Mr Grisham has someone ghostwriting for him
B00A8ECU24|4.0|its fun and nice to have but I hate that you need friends to give you hearts in order to get a good chunk of the ponies.
1400052181|5.0|Everyone needs to know about the HeLe cells!  great book, quick read, very informative.  Hope they make a movie out of this one.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|Great follow up to Firefly.  I thought the bonus features were entertaining as well.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.  Delivery was prompt as well.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I think everyone should read these type of books so they exactly what is going on outthere in the world.  To many people have their own little world.  They hear little bits and piece on the news, which is usually slanted in a particular direction, form an opinion and move on.  It you don't believe me just look at our last election.
B00009TB5G|4.0|Item was in practically-new condition, as promised, and arrived very quickly. Only interesting thing was that the booklet inside seemed to be of lesser quality than those of Fellowship of the Ring and Return of the King. Not sure if it was manufactured this way, or if the seller had lost the original booklet and had to reprint it on a home inkjet printer. Not a dealbreaker for me though. Overall very satisfied!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|BETTER THAN THE GREEK SERIES. I thought at first the GREEK was BETTER but THAN I read this! Awesome :)
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Everything The Piano Guys do us wonderful. There is so much fun and beauty in what they put out, I can listen to it for hours on end!
B009A3NGF4|3.0|This album, while decent, did not wow me.  More of the same, no risks, and I would like the band to bring back more horns!
0439023491|4.0|fair to good condition and quick delivery.  Enjoy the series even though not a teen.  recommend as a good read for most people. the delivery time was good and product satisfactory.
0761169253|4.0|Sometimes you know these things but need a reminder and also a little pep talk. This what the book is. It reminds you to take notice and not fret the small stuff. Keep a bigger perspective on things and enjoy your accomplishments. Took me a bus ride and a half home from the office to read front to back.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|One thing I look for in a good book is that the author can tell a story and leave the readers craving more. Rothfuss does so with an ease that is awe-inspiring! He has a way with words that lingers with the reader, and his storytelling comes from the heart and soul. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who has a love of good stories. This is one of the best!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I thought this was an amazing book that was full of excitement and adventure. I can't wait for more. I definenetly recommend this book. You will be asking for more after reading it.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Had me right up until the end.  Well paced and above all a good story.  Would recommend for fans of the X-Files.
B006WAIV6M|3.0|Overall this is a good book, and worth reading.  Its early chapters in particular are insightful and interesting.<br /><br />However, in the later chapters it really spreads it initial premise a bit too thin and this compromises the integrity of the whole book in my opinion.  A bit more detail and a bit less expansiveness would have served this book well (although perhaps made it less popular).
B000N6XW7O|5.0|Delivered exactly as promised.  As a teacher I was looking for a way to help my students with this text and this audio cd has been a huge help.  Be advised that is does come on multiple cd's.
B000069KGM|5.0|I'm thrilled to finally get this classic debut album by Chicago on CD, the double vinyl album now on a single disc. Thankfully, nothing has been chopped up or edited, so fans of the original LP will hear what they remember ... and love. Yes, this was back before the wimpy ballad era, back when the guys in Chicago daringly, and thrilingly, mixed rock and jazz and pop and even psychedelia to create an intoxicating musical brew. This album is all over the place, which I love. You get the hits such as \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is\\" ... \\"Beginnings\\" ... \\"Question 67 And 68\\", plus some Hendrix-like jamming by Terry Cath on \\"Free Form Guitar,\\" a great cover of \\"I'm A Man,\\" and the uplifting \\"Prologue.\\" Hard to imagine a band being allowed such freedom to create an album like this nowadays. This is one to savor.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|It is not frustrating like the old version of O.T. (if you remrmber that). This keeps wanting you to buy energy,etc., but all you have to do is wait a few minutes (take your Kindle and do something productive while you wait) and you'll get more energy for free.
B00785P2QC|4.0|this is a great game. really entertaining!!!! plus it is free. great time waster, works great on fire. no pop ups or thing that make you purchase unneccessary things.
B0012BQ60O|5.0|I bought this for my niece for Christmas.  She loves Schleigh, and she was telling me that her brother has way more &#34;blue&#34; knights than she has &#34;red&#34;, so he's always winning their battles.  Well...I'm a big fan of being her favorite Aunt, so...

B009369Z8A|5.0|I saw this in the theater and loved it so much, I pre-ordered it.  I love it so much.  Tom Hardy is absolutely flawless as this character.  It's very violent and I have to close my eyes for certain parts.  I love the story.  Rent it before you buy to make sure it's for you!
B002ZG99N6|5.0|Awesome movie especially if you are from Boston or you know the area.  I love this movie and watch it all the time. Was a must have for me!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Loved the fast shipping.  And I love having all the movies together in a set.  My grandkids destroyed the first DVD of Harry and I never got the others.  I will keep these forever.  No little hands will touch this set!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I was either laughing or crying through 80% of the reading process, sometimes both. 100% of the time I was thinking deep thoughts, a rare state of being for most YA reads nowadays. If that's not a mark of a great book, I'm not sure what is.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I liked the season overall and felt there was some good story development between the group in the prison and the &#34;governor's group&#34; in the town. However, there were definitely a few episodes where I left feeling that not much happened.  Overall, it was good, but hoping the next season, or the second half of this one, picks up the pace a little.

I promise you there will be no regrets in this music. These men are our Masters of music for this generation. They embrace what was given by those Greats in the past and have written their genius into the stars already to be passed to the next.<br />Buy this album and fall in love.

B00337KMAA|4.0|Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) is a professional hatchet man. He's not a bad person, and works hard to do his job well and with the minimum of emotional damage. But, let's face it, he fires people for a living. His life, though, his home, is up in the air and in airports and hotels. He takes great pride in the perks of an extremely frequent flier. He can't stand being in Omaha, where he rents an apartment, and where his company is based, and hasn't seen his sisters in years. His tidy philosophy of life, summed up in a speech he delivers about letting go of emotional baggage and needless possessions, is upset by a new woman (Vera Farmiga) in his life and a new plan at work to do their downsizing from a distance, which means he would be stuck working from home.<br /><br />\\"Up in the Air\\" is a potent little film, tightly told with a pitch perfect script and compelling performances all around. It's funny and a delight to watch from the beginning, but builds into something much more than a showcase for a charismatic leading man. Sure, in a nutshell it can be summed up as a film about the trade-offs between the freedom from attachment and the loneliness of isolation. Still, there's something more here. The film manages to be extremely timely -- in its almost documentary depiction of the devastation that has followed in the wake of the current financial crisis -- and at the same time has the classic feel of an old Hollywood romance between mismatched and star-crossed sparring lovers. The film also addresses the impact on people of the lifestyle imposed by the modern way of doing business, of being up in the air and away from home all the time, and at the same time the film raises questions about what happens to relationships in a time when it's often easier to connect (and disconnect) via text or email or facebook than face-to-face. This is intelligent film making - entertaining to watch, but not mere escapism, and not false in its depictions of the contradictions and conflicts that characterize contemporary American life.icts that characterize contemporary American life.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this app because it tested your brain. it is also.fun because you can. buy stuff and you can play atone.
0316212377|3.0|OK, I love this author but off late his books have fallen flat.  Consider this novel, the species is going Sublime, and the 10000 year or so past which nobody (not even this race) cares about is considered a big deal.  Well, you read the novel, no new concepts, not even a big war!  At least this guy finishes off his novels unlike David Weber....<br />My favorite Banks books are 1) The Use of Weapons, 2) Player of Games 3) Consider Phebas and 4) Inversions.<br /><br />For Banks fans, this is a must read.  For others who wish to experience him for the first time select his earlier books before 2000.

B004H1V5RU|5.0|Hi! im a fourth grader and my teacher has a Perplexus Epic  in  our room. This game is fun and very additive! This game is also challenging and if your trying out perplxus for the first time yo might want to get the Origanal or Rookie. I suggest this game to anyone 7 and older depending on how hard the one you get is becuase  these can be confusing for beginners! I hope this review was helpful for you.

B005SZNZAY|5.0|This album is so satisfying on so many levels, primarily showing Chris Cornell as more than the frontman and &#34;back-up guitarist&#34; for Soundgarden.  As he has said in interviews during the tour from which these tracks were recorded, it doesn't get more intimate than a man performing a few feet from a small audience with just what his hands and voice can do.  I am a huge Soundgarden fan, but I really enjoy the bare bones talent that is allowed to shine without the formidable amplified architecture of the band's identity, too.  It is also impressive to hear how these older songs stand up since they were released in the 90s.  If listening to &#34;Call Me a Dog&#34; on this album doesn't leave a lump in your throat, then you are truly in need of what Chris Cornell has to offer here.
B008BTOVL6|5.0|I was a little hesitant buying this because it was being shipped from overseas but it works just fine and no issues.
1476712042|4.0|(really a 4.5 stars) Unless you have a reading pile as long as mines, that can probably wrap around the planet, then you have read or seen the rave reviews for Beautiful Disaster. Jamie McGuire has created a gut wrenching powerhouse of a romance novel. Such intensity within these pages, especially at the end. The title of this book couldn't have been more prefect for the story. How many of us can relate to the title. Some of us have at one point in our lives gone through a phase where yes we are beautiful inside but the path we are leading is disastrous until you yourself or someone helps you snap out of it. Everything about Beautiful Disaster amplifies the title and more, I truly enjoyed it.<br /><br />In this story we follow along Abby, she has transformed herself into goodie Ms. Two Shoes. She even chose to study far away from home, so no one would find out about her dark past and dragged her best friend with her. Everything is working out as planned until she meets and sees Travis, the ultimate hotter than hell bad boy. Abby knows she must resist his charms, unlike any other girl at their college who practically throw themselves at him when he is in their presences. She can't let herself even be friends with someone like him, it would mean bringing up her past. Travis fights on the lowdown to earn extra cash and Abby sees this attitude when she attends one of his secret fights, she is shaken to her core with what she witness. How hard will Abby have to fight to resist Travis. Well when she looses a bet and has to deal with Travis one on one, that wall that she has worked real hard to keep upright, is caving by the second. Thing is though, Abby isn't the only one that is changing. Travis might be losing some of the bad boy in him, seems Travis has finally found his match with Abby. They will either make it through together or let the past directed the future.<br /><br />You might be wondering why I didn't give it the full 5 trees, well Travis's character as much as I did love him, I also hated him at times. His possessiveness drove me insane at times and would even make me take reading breaks. Its like I was one of those cartoon characters when the steams blows out of their ears, yea Travis caused the reaction a few times. Then Abby would make up and everything was alright in the world again until the next issue. So it was just that small detailed, but I still loved and thought like the rating says, that the book was outstanding. So if Beautiful Disaster is still sitting in your reading pile as TBR or you haven't bought it, I suggest that you do and very soon. I am excited to read Walking Disaster that's written in Travis's POV and read his side of the story. I bet then I'll understand Mr. Macho. - Yaraas I did love him, I also hated him at times.

0345803485|1.0|This is the first time I've ever written a review of a book I haven't read. Therefore it is not a review so much as a comment on the reviews.<br />I note that many of the reviewers who gave it one star seemed to be pretty literate in writing their reviews; while many of the five-star reviewers could scarcely express themselves in the English language.<br />'Nuff said. I will not bother to read Fifty Shades of Grey.<br />I DID 'go inside' to read the sample offered by Amazon. I was not impressed by the quality of the writing or by the subject of the novel. This is a personal opinion only.<br />HOWEVER, may I congratulate the author on becoming rich. The success of this novel demonstrates an important level of the state of today's popular readership. A bit scary.
B009JBZH54|5.0|this is a great gift set. I would totally recommend this to anyone who is interested in purchasing this item.
6305176299|4.0|I Like the featured actors<br />, the plot and the production. Saw this movie when it was`released and enjoyed it.
B00913DPW2|5.0|I want to be sure that I write this so that no one mistakes it for a \\"fake\\" review (which seems to be becoming prevalent lately).  I'm an avid Adventure game player, from 'back in the day' of text-based adventures.  I have spent years playing games like the Myst series, the Zork series, and others like them.  For the past year of owning an Android tablet, I have been waiting for a good point-and-click adventure game on that platform.  I have not seen one as good as The Haunt.<br /><br />I'm still in the early stages of the game, but I am amazed at the graphics.  The scenes are extremely well-rendered, and the accompanying sound track is also very fitting for the subject.  As in any good adventure game, the exploring and \\"discovery\\" are a large part of the game.  Solving puzzles is another.  So far, I've been quite pleased with the \\"size\\" of the game -- that is, the \\"footprint\\" that it has, consisting of several levels of an old house, as well as outbuildings behind the house.  As I'd find each new room, I'd think to myself \\"There's MORE???\\"<br /><br />There are some things that make the game mildly tedious.  There is a very limited set of \\"random text strings\\" that are used when there's nothing to do.  After a while, I just ignored all of the \\"There's nothing to do here\\" and \\"There is a feeling of paranormal activity here\\" messages, as they repeated virtually everywhere.  But there was a very good balance of objects to find (my inventory is already quite large, with a good scrolling display) and figure out how to use, as well as the coins and puzzle pieces that are a part of the \\"background game\\".  (There are almost 100 pieces to a jigsaw puzzle, scattered throughout the game.  I happen to enjoy jigsaw puzzles, so I like this feature.  Others may find it boring.  But it's a big part of the game.)<br /><br />There are also quite a few full-screen puzzles -- which are well-integrated into the overall scenery and story.  Some of the puzzles are more obvious than others.  Several reviewers have commented on the difficulty of the game.  I enjoy \\"brain puzzles\\"; so I'm not put off when I run across ones that I can't solve immediately.  (If immediate gratification is what \\"floats your boat\\" when playing a game, The Haunt probably will disappoint you.  If you have the patience to play an adventure game -- especially those similar to what I mentioned above -- you'll enjoy The Haunt much more.)<br /><br />I have yet to finish it, so I can't put a \\"play time\\" figure on it yet.  But I'm pleased enough that I can hardly wait to get to 'The Haunt 2'.  This is a well-done game -- particularly on the Android platform.  And I hope to see many more like this.<br /><br />Update: 1/3/13<br />I've been playing The Haunt off and on for a couple of weeks now.  And I'll make some additional comments to my original.  First and foremost, adventures games as a whole are very \\"audience specific\\".  Several reviewers here have commented that you either love them or hate them.  That is true with The Haunt.  Adventure games require different skills, different personalities, different approaches -- even different \\"time resources\\".  They're not level games; they're not hidden object games, or arcade games that you can play for 30 seconds while on the elevator.  They take an investment in time.  A good adventure game SHOULDN'T be \\"obvious\\"; it should require investigation, exploration, and a story with integrated puzzles.  In fact, most of the puzzles should typically have two stages:  the first being just to figure out what the heck the puzzle is about -- that is, what is the goal you're supposed to achieve.  After you have that figured out, the second is to figure HOW to achieve it.  This is all an investment in time and attention.<br /><br />Players who like games with immediate gratifcation *will* hate adventure games; I've seen this response for more than 20 years -- since the first text adventure (Colossal Cave, still one of my favorites) came out.  BUT...  for those of us who *love* this kind of game, for those who want a brain challenge, not just a thumb challenge, for those who love the exilharation of success after toughing out a really intricate puzzle... for those people, The Haunt presents an outstanding adventure game.  And I will continue to say that I believe this to be the best adventure game created so far on the Android platform.<br /><br />With that said, I will add some caveats.  It's not easy to design a really good adventure game.  Yes, you want lots of exploration -- where nothing (seemingly) is going on for perhaps long periods of time.  So that exploration has to remain interesting, has to hold the user's attention.  Yes, you want tough puzzles.  But when they are TOO tough, or when the clues are either lacking, or too easily missed (or the puzzles are simply too difficult to manipulate), they can become frustrating.<br /><br />I encountered that in several places in The Haunt.  I'm not bothered by a puzzle with 99 pieces that I have to gather from around the game; I understand that will take time, and be a \\"background activity\\".  But when I get to a puzzle -- one single puzzle (and there are MANY in this game) -- that takes my time simply for mundane manipulative \\"busy work\\", I get frustrated.  One such is a puzzle that, when I first discovered it, appeared to be a simple sliding tile puzzle.  This one was a 4x6 puzzle, with a fairly understandable picture.  So it was fairly straightforward to complete it.  (Like adventure games as a whole, sliding time puzzles are something you either love or hate.  They're not my favorite, but I'll do one occasionally.)<br /><br />To my surprise, however, after solving this puzzle, it didn't complete the task.  I wasn't even quite sure why not, or what to do next -- except that a new picture appeared.  I must admit, I had a peek at the walkthrough provided by the developers.  And it's a good thing that I did.  Turns out that this was a special \\"three-in-one\\" sliding tile puzzle -- where you had to complete THREE pictures, each of them getting a bit more difficult.  And nowhere in the game was there a clue of any kind what any of the pictures should look like.  The second one was almost completely abstract, just blue and white -- it would have driven me insane, had I not peeked at the walkthrough (which contained an image of the finished puzzle).<br /><br />This puzzle was \\"TMW\\" -- too much work.  Solving the first puzzle proved that I know how to solve a sliding tile puzzle.  Making me do a second one immediately thereafter -- when this next picture wasn't even understood or imagined, but rather abstract -- was tedious.  Then to make me do a third one after that...  it was \\"TMW\\".  Not \\"fun\\" work, just \\"busy\\" work.<br /><br />As if that weren't enough, there was also no may of sliding a row or column of tiles (as in many other sliding tile puzzles); you had to click individually on each tile to move it one space at a time.  Even worse, there was a slight pause before you could click on another tile.  So there was no ability to do a fast \\"click-click-click-click\\" to move rapidly through the tiles.  Instead, it was \\"click... click... click... click...\\"  Without question, this was the most tedious puzzle in the game.  And without the walkthrough (which showed all three pictures), I think it would have been nearly impossible -- certainly not worth the amount of effort involved.  This is really more of a note to the developers, because I truly love this game, and look forward to The Haunt 2 (and perhaps even more).  The key is to keep the players interest -- not make them want to throw the game across the room.<br /><br />Overall, I still say that *IF* you enjoy (or think you might enjoy) a well-written adventure game, with excellent graphics (and an eerie sound track), and TONS of puzzles, this is the best I've seen for Android.  I've been awed by the \\"footprint\\" (i.e., the number of scenes that make up the overall landscape)of the game.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Fey does a superb job covering the issues all women deal with in one form or another and she does it with humor and a certain Lemon grace only she can deliver. Bossypants is a must read and re-read.

B00AHXIC50|5.0|If Michael Jackson were still alive and 25 years old today I beleive that 'Unorthodox Jukebox' would be an album that he would have made. For some reason to me it has an \\"Off the Wall\\" feel to it that I have become absolutly addicted to. I have never been a Bruno Mars fan until I just happened to stumble by this album on Rhapsody and ever since yesterday it has taken over my earphones and I havent been able to listen to anything else. Such charisma and talent went into crafting this album and my hats off to you Bruno Mars.  Quality pop music is entering another golden age and this album is proof of that.
B009FXIICK|1.0|This game has very poor graphics, like the old DOS games, but not the same fun. There are many other similar games much better than this
B005VPRET4|5.0|I bought this for my five year old and it was great fun to put together.  She did have a few issues when we were putting the &#34;shell&#34; of the cafe together that she needed my help on, but for the most part it was a great experience.  We had a lot of fun with it and will definitely be looking at more LEGO friends sets.<br /><br />Major drawback was that some of the pieces were tough for her little hands to snap together.  We overcame this by building the entire cafe as a team, big fun.<br /><br />What we liked about it: Building the cafe was a fun experience for Daddy/Daughter time, and this was her first &#34;biig kid&#34; LEGO set.<br /><br />It also shipped very quickly arrived 2 days earlier than projected.
B009O07NDY|5.0|Like so many of you, I have been fascinated by J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth for decades and was thrilled when my prepaid download of the soundtrack began this evening. Thankfully, Howard Shore has once again proven himself more than equal to the task of bringing these marvelous tales to life. Having just re-read the Hobbit, I found that I had forgotten just how much of the story is quite serious in nature. The film score brilliantly reflects the story arc with some light-hearted moments as in \\"Blunt the Knives\\" (a sprightly, Celtic sounding track featuring the dwarves) but quickly takes on the more majestic scope of Tolkien's story as it proceeds. As with Lord of the Rings, Shore presents a full offering of beautiful instrumental pieces, haunting choral pieces, and stirring adventure-themed arrangements of daring and foreboding.<br /><br />Some themes such as \\"The Hidden Valley\\" and \\"The White Council\\" are very reminiscent of the Rivendell pieces from LOTR. We book lovers especially appreciate how brilliantly Howard Shore has captured the *feel* of Tolkien's work and brought it to life. The dwarves' rendition of Misty Mountains is most interesting -- deep voices joined in melancholy song. This is one of my favorite tracks and one which is intertwined very effectively throughout the rest of the soundtrack, much in the vein of the Fellowship theme in the Lord of the Rings movies. And of course, the Gollum and Bilbo scenes are brought to menacing life in \\"Riddles in the Dark\\". The music is just what you would expect of a scene like this.<br /><br />This is one for the ages -- brilliant soundtrack and one I expect to listen to over and over again.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|World War Z and I go back...I've read this book 7 times and it never ceases to amaze me.  I've actually lost and purchased the book 3 times.  If you want a realistic outlook on a potential zombie apocalypse I highly recommend this book.  The movie is do out Summer of 2013.
B000FBJHZS|4.0|This is one of those books that made me want to read in one sitting.  It was  like my favorite dessert.  I wanted to savor every bite and so made myself read it slowly because I didn't want it to end.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Amazon App integrated into my PS3 works fine, purchased this and was watching Season 4 in less then 5 minutes.  Great quality, HD.
B008FOB124|5.0|Having had this album in the mix for over a year now I realize i was at first much too critical of it. It is a great album hands down.. It did not meet my expectations initially so i think i was a little disappointed. I am no longer. Dead can Dance can do what ever the heck they want with their songs.. And they have. And the product is an amazing addition to their legendary body of work.uses his percussive specialties and haunting, bold vocals to describe a yearning for the dark and sublime.. And  and 'Kiko', a piece that incorporates a 4-4-4-6 time signature, something a bit new for the band. Both pieces seem to be on a very high level of cooperation/incorporation between all members. Both feel like the work of Dead Can Dance and less like the solo work of Gerrard or Perry.<br /><br />Contrast these with the last two songs on the album. 'Return of the She-King' is a lovely work but sounds like it escaped from one of Lisa Gerrard's movie scores.. 'All in Good Time' is a beautiful piece but sounds like it belongs more in one of Brendan Perry's solo albums.<br /><br />I love everything that Dead Can Dance has ever put out.. EVERYTHING. From the first studio (mask) album to Spiritchaser and the live album series that came out after their 2005 tour, everything has been GREAT in my opinion. I am nuts for it. And I am also a fan of their solo work, though less so. I feel this album lacks much of the collaborative magic that so easily flows through former albums, though I hate to say it.

B004LWZWGK|5.0|Really great film, and a perfect end to a great trilogy. It rewards the viewer with multiple views. Ignore the bad reviews, as most are only in response to the Ultra-Violet quality and not the film itself.
B0072OFM28|5.0|My son has been wanting this DVD & was absolutely thrilled to receive it. He lives out of state so I send him packages occasionally & he was very happy to find this item included.

B0036SUQWA|1.0|The story, as it was delivered, failed to keep my attention or interest. I was looking forward to seeing this movie, but it was difficult staying awake to watch it in its entirety.
B009GX69RK|3.0|While I really enjoy New Girl, it crosses the &#34;too sleazy&#34; line for me fairly often, which is why I stopped paying for the episodes. But if you like Zoey Deschanel and are looking for a raunchy comedy, this might just be for you.

B008GXHOFW|4.0|This is a fun and great looking game that I enjoyed playing a lot. Great graphics and smooth gameplay, but I would never have payed $7 for a mobile game that also tries to sell you upgrades during gameplay. I got it when it was down to a buck and wish I would have done that when Batman did the same. Don't know why the price jumped back up on these 2 games but if I pay that much for a mobile I want it all.

B0002HZLWI|4.0|These blocks seem very durable and are lovely overall.  There are almost too many shapes and sizes, however, to the point where you might have to dig deep to find a specific type when building something.  For a younger baby or young toddler especially, I would recommend getting a more standard set of blocks.
B008NW67E0|5.0|A solid work by Mumford & Sons.  If you liked their earlier album, you'll love this one as well.  The set comes off as folksy and energetic with every song fitting together nicely with the rest.  As such, they go with the style and sound that got them noticed in the first place, so nothing too adventurous for them here, but I don't think there is anything wrong with getting more of there style of music.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|you would think we would get full access like on our iphones or android phones ! wrong! you cant see past the first 5-10 posts thats it ! please send out a patch for this
B005BX3NAA|3.0|I will admit that I am not a huge GnR fan like some of my friends, so that may color my impressions, but I was a bit disappointed in this selection of songs.  While their best music is represented (September Rain, Paradise City, etc.) the album has quite a large selection of cover songs, which while uniquely their (his) style, are still cover songs.  Maybe there is a better selection of their music out there, or maybe they really were just a cover band with a couple of good originals thrown into the mix.  Hard to tell from this &#34;Greatest Hits&#34; collection.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|This movie will always be one of my favorites, no matter what age I am. The classics never fail me!
B007JOM0GC|5.0|A wonderful extended version of the Teenage Dream album.  If you like Katy Perry, you'll love this version with plenty of remixes of songs that you've heard many times already on the radio.

B009E2WX3W|5.0|This album is one of, if not the, best album of the eighties.  The remastering is excellent and given my love of his entire career worth of music was worth buying again in this form, as the audio levels are greatly improved from my older CD set.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|this movie was so funny and hilarious. i loved how i didnt know what was going to happen next. the speial effects are pretty good as well
B0082JYAZ2|5.0|I love her quirky voice and and singing style.  It ends up adding a little more energy than you would normally get, and the songs end up being quite fun to listen to as a result.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|i love the storyline, and how they make snow white more active and not so much the damsel in distress
B008J34466|5.0|I liked the single &#34;Blow Me (One More Kiss)&#34; before I heard the rest of the album, and while that is probably the strongest song of the CD, there are certainly other great songs on it.  Overall, a solid CD with mostly up-beat songs.

B006OAB3ME|4.0|This is a slight departure from the normally pop/rock McCartney.  Still, it is a wonderful album filled with charming bluesy/folksy songs that should be quite comfortable to listen to for any McCartney fan.
0385535147|5.0|Of 1861 people who wrote reviews of this book on 12-12-12 and placed it on amazon, the day I submitted my review, an overwhelming 1399 gave The Racketeer either four or five stars and commented how suspenseful and fun the book is, and only 206 disliked the book and gave it one or two stars. I liked the book and raised the positive number to a rounded 1400.<br /><br />The story, as many commented, requires readers to suspend belief because much of what transpires is either impossible or near so. But as the Yiddish aphorism teaches auf a maaseh freged min nished ken kashes, which freely translated means, if you want to enjoy a story, you frequently need to suspend asking questions whether what you're told is possible; just enjoy. And enjoy I did; and I think others will as well.<br /><br />The story is about a very smart black lawyer, Malcolm Bannister, who makes only enough money to subsist simply because he is black. The whites in town prefer to go to white lawyers and many of the blacks also think that the white lawyers are smarter. But Mr. Bannister shows readers that he is far from dumb. We see that he is able to outwit the white police and FBI.<br /><br />The story starts when a politically-interested but morally-disadvantaged US Attorney needs to jail people and brings suit against Mr. Bannister for a crime of money laundering, even though he is innocent. Mr. Bannister is sentenced to ten years. Soon a federal judge is murdered and our hero decides to use this event to get out of jail and finally secure a huge sum of money. Readers will enjoy finding out what he does and how he does it.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This show is fantastic, the only gripe I have with AMC is that they split this season up into two parts, like last year. I hope this doesn't become the norm. As for the actual show, best zombie adaptation I've seen in any medium.
B000AP04OM|5.0|Great product, shipped on time. I LOVE THIS MOVIE! Julie Andrews is the best! Nice picture quality, it is definitely a most have!
B008SVS3FC|4.0|I liked &#34;Dirty Jean and Mudslide Hymns&#34; better, but &#34;Woodchipper&#34; is awesome. This CD is well worth it for Hiatt fans.

030758836X|4.0|Flynn is a brilliant strategist and creator of character and \\"felt life.\\" This is a book you can't put down. The only problem is that, despite the exhilaration of enjoying Flynn's incredible talent and, of course, wondering what's going to happen next, the substance of the plot is terribly depressing--not exactly the kind of experience I want to have indulging in my love of reading.
B001URVSPS|5.0|J. Legend has been my favorite since I know him, and this album in particular although it's way back.<br />Downloaded very fast and has been playing ever since on my laptop.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Simple to set up, lots of settting, and free.  Gave it 4 stars only because I don't like the advertisement at the bottom of the screen but don't want to buy the paid version in order to get rid of it.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|What a book.... I can not stop thinking about it!!<br />There are so many stories and the back ground of the 1rst world war makes you travel there and dream about it.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|My 3 year old LOVES this movie. He saw it last year and asked for it almost all year long. He'll be excited to get it. I really enjoy this movie too.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very good fast read.  All of Nicholas Sparks books have always been a good read.  He has yet to dissapoint.

B006AZZPCM|2.0|shuts down my Kindle. For some reason or other it shuts my kindle compleatly off. I could possible be doing something wrong like viewing the video on Youtube. But I havent seen an explaination as to why
B002RT2BXQ|4.0|This is a great movie.  I am no fan of Ayn Rand's philosopy, but this is a passionate, melodramatic, stylish treatment of a rather banal allegory about the architecture of integrity.  The acting is over the top as these characters make the most of the soapbox given them, but even more fascinating are the costumes and decor, which puts the Jetsons back in the '40s, for a glamorous mood framing this intense romance.  In terms of the story's moral, however, I kept thinking that in real life, the people making the biggest fuss about &#34;individualism&#34; herein are the least likely to walk the walk.  Liberals are parodied to the point of being ridiculous.  Gary Cooper is truly heroic, meanwhile, and Patricia Neal is the ultimate Wonder Woman.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|I love the entire album, but I wish they didn't waste space in the disc with track 1, 2 and 9? Wish the first track was a bit longer. They usually open their concerts with that song.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This blu ray set is great.  It comes with 5 disks with special features.  I waited in line for over 8 hours to watch the dark knight rises on opening night.  For the price of $30 bucks this is a must buy.  Especially for those who do not want to drop the money for the collectors edition coming out in 2013.
B009VB97EY|4.0|If you find men attractive then you'll probably enjoy this movie.  It's not going to expand your mind or anything but it's entertaining and has more of a plot then I expected.  Definitely entertaining.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Love the suspense. Almost at the end.  Can't wait to see what happens. It's hard to put down. Go read
B0099G6Q5E|3.0|There are a couple of weird production choices on the soundtrack versus the actual movie, but it's still pretty good.  I do wish it had Bulletproof on it, seems like that would have made sense for the soundtrack but it's not on here.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I've always had my own way of thinking and doing things.  I thought I was totally unique in that respect.  After reading &#34;Proof of Heaven&#34;, I find out that I'm unique...but not totally.  Dr. Alexander proves that he also is unique not only in how he writes, but his ability to cause your brain to ask questions while having the reader totally caught up in his story.  I Love it !! :)<br /><br />Earl
B008602KQI|5.0|I thought this was a surprisingly good adaptation of the book when you consider the audience it was intended for.  There were some obvious adjustments to make this more friendly to young teens but I didn't feel that it really took away from the story in a meaningful way.  You miss some of the more nuanced issues between Gale, Peeta, and Katniss but I think that realistically that's true of most movie adaptations of books.  I would definitely recommend reading the books because I thought they were amazing, but the movie version is pretty good as well.
B00318DA3W|4.0|I found myself rereading many passages for the purpose of savoring Jane Austen 's turn of phrase.  As always, her understanding of human relationships is demonstrated on every page.  Her insight was obviously developed after much acute observation and deep thought.  I thoroughly enjoy every mental journey her books impart.
0446613444|5.0|The book was a page turner.  Harry Bosch is an interesting Homicide Detective and Michael Connelly knows how to keep the reader engaged. I have bought many of his books and have yet to be disappointed.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I have thousands of good words  to say about this book.Great job! Five stars. :) Let's hope Gregory gets a date. °·°
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I absolutely love Batman, everything the charactor stands for as well as the movies and video games themselves. The Dark Knight Rises took me on a roller coaster ride and even though I was taken aback by the ending, this movie did not fail to live up to the hype.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Pines, Blake Crouch While reading the story I was confused as was Special Agent, John Ethan Burke.  Wayward Pines is a very mysterious place.  The ending I did not see coming.  This was a very interesting story concept after I finished it and was able to view the whole story line.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I gave this a 5 star even though there are glaring editorial errors, I'm hoping to see those fixed in new editions. The story though is superb. I couldn't stop reading it, and I'm not one to read more than an hour or so a day. I can't wait to read book two. My only hope is that this story will become no more than a trilogy. Series just get drawn out and tired. I think this story as a trilogy could be a masterpiece, maybe more so than JRR Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. Of course that's just my opinion.<br /><br />For a first entry, this was an amazing read! It is a bit hard to follow due to the change in times through the book. I read it on Kindle, so it was easy to go back and find names that appear later on in the story, or recap what happen earlier in the accounts. It's like a mob movie, the best ones have many people to follow and an intricate plot. This book has that.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|bought for a christmas gift. have the other dvds on men in black. really a super fan, very happy with purchase
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Got to be my favorite book! Liked all of them but this is got to be the best o.e for me
B009VB97EY|4.0|I bought this for my wife...Nuff said!<br /><br />It is a funny movie though, and gets the wife in the mood!  Lol.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am into this kind of book. Whenever I read it I get sucked in and I can't put it down!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Let me start by saying I'm a horror wimp.  I'm not a fan of gore, and watch some of this show between slitted fingers, or with eyes averted.  And yet, this is my absolute favorite show these days!  I've \\"marathoned\\" Seasons 1 and 2 over a period of 2-3 days TWICE.  Season 3 is the best so far, and I imagine I'll be re-watching those episodes too, during the mid-season hiatus it's currently in.<br /><br />Why do I love it so much?  Mostly because the post-apocalypse genre fascinates me.  I've always been intrigued by how people might survive any \\"end of life as we know it\\" scenario.  The walkers/zombies in this particular story add a bit of an edge that's fun even for horror wimps like me.<br /><br />It's not perfect, but I think the writing is really good overall.  Some of the acting grates a bit, but none of its shortcomings are major, and certainly don't interfere with my enjoyment remotely enough to consider not watching.<br /><br />This IS a pretty hard-core show.  Favorite characters die, rays of hope turn to horror, and the future in general is very bleak.  It's not completely hopeless, though.  No idea where they're going to take it, ultimately, but I'm having a lot of fun on this ride so far!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game, it's fun and can be addicting. A great way to unwind at the end of the day! Love it!
B001GCUNYO|4.0|First, I don't like that Amazon integrates all the various formats into one review section.<br /><br />Second, as a movie review, I really like this movie. I know a lot is unbelievable and even impossible. I like the basic storyline and the intense action. It also hits on a real life issue of human trafficking. Exposing issues like this may help make people be more aware and help to stop such heinous acts. Again, as a movie, I think some people are reading too much into it giving it undo lowered ratings. Movies are for entertainment and this movie is entertaining. I  think Shrek is an entertaining movie and I don't expect to see a large green ogre appearing around the corner.<br /><br />Third, as a bluray DVD which I purchased, I am very disappointed. The quality of the picture is only about equivalent to a standard DVD and the dark scenes are very grainy looking worse than VHS if any of you out there even remember VHS. Some good with the DVD format is the extra scenes and a cool death/injured counter throughout the movie. Again, all for your entertainment.<br /><br />Overall, I give the movie a strong 4.5 stars and the bluray disc only 3 stars giving a total of 3.75 stars for the bluray movie of Taken.
0385366752|5.0|This started off a bit slow I thought - I got on amazon and read the reviews twice to keep me going - then POW - omg what a ride - I have been enjoying this tremendously!  The two narrators are superb!  Have another hour or two to go and have no idea how it will end - but loving every  minute.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I like how detailed the information is. So much better than the standard Fire hd battery sign. Almost a bit too much info at first glance. Itis all very useful and very accurate though. Well done!!
0061906220|5.0|This book is fun and an easy read. My kids have other books that make me cringe when they're selected but not this one. Pete has a great attitude and there's participation parts for my three year old...\\"Pete stepped in a big pile of?\\"...\\"Strawberries!\\"...\\"What color did it turn his shoes?\\"...\\"Red!\\". My seven year old likes to log on to the website and hear the story and follow along with the book. I love it and think this will be one of a handful of books that may make my children think of their childhood when they're adults and possibly buy it for their little ones.
B00122N23M|5.0|better produced, more relaxed and involving than the final album versions. true of so many artists, the &#34;demos&#34; often surpass the finished product. these certainly do.
6304400551|5.0|MY CHILDREN REMEMBER THIS MOVIE SO I THOUGHT MY GRANDCHILDREN WOULD LIKE IT AND THEY DO.  CONFESSION:  REALLY BOUGHT THIS FOR ME.  THE INTERACTION OF THE ANIMATION AND ACTORS IS WONDERFUL NO ONE CAN SING LIKE JULIE ANDREWS AND DICK VAN DYKE'S DANCING FANTASTIC.  BRINGS OUT THE CHILDREN IN US ALL.
B002YK8OKC|5.0|we rented this the quality was great they have improved the streaming since last year,the movie still makes us laugh every year a must watch for Christmas.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I found this very helpful. After reading it I am very confident in finishing my book and publishing it. I especially want to note the how to format in word section as being very informative.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This has to be the most useful app I have bought. Gives me the information I need at my fingertips.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|What an great story!!! The flow of the story was perfect, not too fast or too slow. I did not want it to end!! I will definitely be re-reading it in the near future!!
B00003CXRM|5.0|This is a wonderful movie and I love having it in my video library. A classic I will never forget.
0061992860|5.0|This neat little survival guide came to me in great condition.<br />For some reason I thought it would be bigger but I'm not bothered by its size. In fact, I fount it rather convient (it fits perfectly in my purse).<br />It was very informative and covers all the topics as was advertised and more.<br />Another plus is that the author used to be in the military so he knowsd what he is talking about.<br />I love my purchase and recommend to anyone who want a good survival guide.
B00425S1H8|5.0|good product for what we needed it for.  Worked properly as could be expected.  good solution for companies with older hardware.  Besides that, we have nothing additional to comment about this product.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|I was skeptical about this product at first, because I was hearing mixed reviews about it. There have been many people I have spoke to who said it wasn't worth it. I am a hardcore PC gamer I for the past 10 years or so I played all my FPS (first person shooters) on PC from Counter Strike to Black Ops. I brought a Black Ops 2 for PS3 because most of my friends have been playing on console. I am not comfortable using the PS3 controller for FPS because it is a big difference than what I am use to. I was debating between this product and the FragFX Shark. I am very happy that I chose this one. It was very easy to set up, I read many reviews about how it takes a long time to tweak, but I went on Eagle Eyes website and there was people there who was nice enough to upload their tweaks for everyone to download, so There was little to no set up time at all, it was basically plug and play. I do not see any faults or delay in the movement also I am able to move a lot faster and do things that you are not able to do in Black Ops 2 with a regular controller such as \\"Bunny Hop\\". With the standard PC FPS keyboard layout this product is great and I highly recommend it to anyone switching from PC to console and is looking to keep PC control.<br /><br />The one trade off is your spin, with the regular controller you can hold the joystick to the left or right and do a complete turn around, with the keyboard and mouse you will have to pick up the mouse and move it over more or increase the sensitivity. I am use to this because its the same with every FPS so its not a problem for me.<br /><br />Bottom line, I highly recommend  Eagle Eye for any PC gamer moving over to console.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I was surprised at how much I got out of this book.  It is such a simple concept that we all seem to miss.  Even if you are not having problems in your relationship(s), this book can be beneficial and further enhance what is already working for you.
B004EKCNMA|5.0|Loved the movie, very impressive. But wouldn't recommend it for kids unless they are able to cope with death and dead people. Very realistic. I know my son wouldn't have liked it, too scary for him at 4. Beautiful story though, just a Christmas classic.
B006ZCWTXS|5.0|Arrived quickly.  Quality CD. All the songs are good and her voice is exceptional. I would  highly recommend this CD
B009SQRL4U|5.0|This is such a fun, heartwarming Christmas movie. Fantastic for the whole family. Get your hot chocolate ready and enjoy!
B0067RQYNW|5.0|It works very well with Galaxy Note 2.<br />You can do most of your Excel documents easy.<br />Highly recommend it.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Keep up the awesome work, guys!<br />Every song they do is fabulous, and even if you don't normally like classical music you might still enjoy it!
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Very Good Music (the real Christmas spirit is within) . . . I really enjoyed it!!! The disc is a demonstration that Classic X-mas music can be played in many different styles and still be good . . .
B003VS0CXS|5.0|Thanks !i  gotit  on time, works very well good quality keep the good work and Merry Christmas for you all
B0064MT1FI|5.0|This is one of my all time Favs!  I had a copy only don't know what happened to it, had to replace it.
B000085RPU|1.0|Why did you send a dvd that you are very sure it does not work here in The United States? Does it make any sense for you? Why don't ask us to be sure before send it to another Country? If you know that it won't work on that Country?
B0084U0IEG|3.0|I was disappointed in Sweet Tooth. I loved Saturday and Atonement because they had depth and difference. Both had an eerie way of getting  under my skin. They left me feeling I had read something by somebody special. Sweet Tooth seemed cutesy and mundane. Nothing special. I read it quickly and was happy to finsih it.
B0061QD7ZM|5.0|Good, got on time, nothing to complain, keep the good work, i wish you have Mary Poppins too Jesus Loves you
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very good story line, keeps you engage the whole time. I never able to put it down.<br /><br />Very well done!
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I needed a new case for my 4S and bought this. It is perfect! The price was great and shipped promptly. I would recommend it if you need a case.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|Total must see!  Huge Jackman is a great Wolverine.  This movie has lots of action and a good compelling story line.
0613722663|4.0|Set in the future, Jonas' world is perfect. No pain, no wars, and no bad feelings such as hatred. But perfect means no good feelings either. No happiness or excitement. It means no music or color either. Each day is monotonous and shielded from the beautiful and ugly truths.<br />  When Jonas is chosen to be the Receiver, it means that he will have to carry the burden of truth for the people in his community.<br />  The book is engrossing and teaches the lesson of the importance of individuality, of feelings, of music, of color, and the importance of having the freedom to choose.<br />  Although the overall storyline is very good, the end is not satisfying and gives a feeling of being rushed. There seems to be a need o f more details at the end.<br />  But overall, the story is a wonderful, engrossing, book and is a must-read.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Watched both seasons about 20 times now and I still get excited the next time I watch it!  The extra features on this DVD are great.  Excellent value for the money, especially since I got the Amazon Local deal on it!
1423113497|4.0|Inspired by the story of Perseus and a lot of classic Greek mythology, the story of The Lightning Thief by Rick Riordan tells a story of how a boy, Percy Jackson, tries to find his<br />mother and return Zeus's lightning bolt to him before a war of the gods starts.<br /> This book starts out when Percy Jackson, A.K.A. \\"The Lightning Thief\\", finds out he is not normal; he is a demigod. But that is not all, right after he finds that out, he is accused of stealing Zeus's lightning bolt, and his mother is kidnapped by Hades, the god of the underworld. He tries to save his mother and prevent a war of the gods. When the story goes on he saves his mom and returns Zeus's lightning bolt by fighting monsters and outsmarting Hades.<br /> This is an amazing book and I hope you will read it. I am looking forward with<br />anticipation to read the rest of the books in the series.
B007V9N5R8|5.0|This product shipped quickly and worked as well as expected. The price is much more reasonable than the full version since I do not do any of my printing. This calibrates my editing screens quickly and easily so that the product from the lab is consistent.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Took a few chapters to hook me, but am now on book two and have a hard time putting it down.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|This film should appeal to all ages. I found it quite entertaining. This is a movie to watch over and over again.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|i got this for my birthday after seeing the movie twice. the kids and i love it!! the only song i miss is bulletproof
B005LAIISA|3.0|Gift Purchase - This is a Christmas gift and has not yet been opened by the recipient which is why I cannot rate it.
B00005V9IL|5.0|One of the best Sci-Fi of all times i think, i had not seen it in years.  So when i saw part of it on tv the other night i had to buy it, so i did.
B00000G3I2|5.0|MOVIE ARRIVED IN NEW CONDITION . GREAT MOVIE TO WATCH OVER AND OVER AGAIN. FUN GIFT TO GET A OLD FRIEND
B0036EH3XE|1.0|Last 3 episodes on 3rd disc didn't work.  The disc was damaged plus had to program every disc for no subtitles otherwise subtitles would automatically be on.  The series itself is addictive so I wasn't happy about the damaged disc.  Ended up renting the three episodes from Blockbuster.
B008NA3HZ4|2.0|I enjoyed Seth Rogen in this film primarily because he seemed mostly normal.  I can't say the same thing for Michelle Williams' character.  Overall, this film was pretty weird but kept my interest throughout it's long running time.  There was a weird nude shower scene with obese older ladies and a lot of the dialogue almost seemed improvised on the spot rather than off a script.  Michelle Williams even made random weird facial contortions in one scene.  I can't say I'd recommend this film unless you're a fan of either Rogen or Williams.  Because of the nudity displayed by Williams, I'm thinking her acting career is in shambles since the Dawson's Creek days...
B008JGSM6G|1.0|This game is too easy. Maybe it would be fine for young kids, but for me it's just not that entertaining.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The best book I have ever read! Onto the next book, \\"Fifty Shades Darker\\". Love this book so freaking much!!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Fun puzzle game with really nice graphics and soothing music. Some of the puzzles are pretty hard and I end up spending way too much time playing it. I love the music, which relaxes me and makes me want to keep playing.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|It was very well done, you do not often get this with a 3rd movie, but it was a good as the 1st. I did miss Agent F but look for him on a poster by the road..
B00004TS0E|5.0|Purchased this for my Sister because she had told me this was her favorite movie.  She was so happy to receive it for Christmas.
B00007AJGH|4.0|Bob Hoskins is perfect in the role of Eddie. Christopher Lloyd is always good in anything he does.  Can anyone have a more sultry voice than Kathleen Turner(i.e. BODY HEAT).  But, please do not mistake this movie for a children's cartoon.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Love this CD - Piano Guys are the best and a lot of fun to listen to.  Every one of my kids will stop and listen to their music and this Album is no exception.  We are always humming one tune or another.
B0061QD7ZM|5.0|This movie has been a favorite of mine since childhood.  Even then my favorite songs were the Siamese cats & Peggy Lee.  Thanks for helping me to introduce my grandchildren to this delightful movie.
0439023521|5.0|In the Hunger Games, Katniss hold the traits of a brave and strong young woman that many girls today would not have but living in her conditions it's understandable why she is the was she is. She also shows the flaws in herself which makes her easier to relate to and makes her more realistic. One this I don't quite buy, though, is how she could remain so calm knowing she was about to go into the games, likely to die along with twenty-two other tributes. Over all I found The Hunger Games to be quite an amazing book and enjoyed the read. I'm currently on the second book and am very hooked. I'D recommend this book to a more mature audience because the book is a bit graphic.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|One of the most amazing series i ever read! No matter how many pages in each book, you're left wanting more & MORE-Read them ALL!
B009439HEY|5.0|It is a real treat to get nearly 2hrs of superbly recorded renditions of these masterpieces.<br />No complaints about the any of the music here, all the renditions are good, and even where a bit surprising ( a female singer on Ripples), it all works really well for me.<br />I have the SACD  re-masters of the original Genesis albums, and in some places, I actually prefer the tracks from this album.<br /><br />Audio quality of this CD is superb, with excellent mixing. Maybe Steve Wilson passed a few pointers on to someone ;-)<br /><br />For the utmost in audio quality true fans and audiophiles can purchase the 24bit / 88.2Khz high-rez FLAC downloads from Steve's own site. I have that as well and it's a noticable step up, so if you have a good system, or listen on high-quality headphones, get that.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Great coming of age story! I can't wait to see the movie when it comes out on DVD! Definitely recommended
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Hollywood deserves much credit for creating a lot of garbage movies nowadays, John Carter is NOT one of them.  After hearing all the bad publicity, I avoided this movie in its initial release.  Having been a fan of the original books since childhood, I was concerned what the filmmakers might have done to my fond memories.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise as my wife and I watched the film and loved every minute!  The plot is very enjoyable and moves at a pace with allows you to actually care for the characters.  The special effects are superb and spark the imagination.  The acting, which was bashed by many critics was excellent.<br /><br />John Carter is a movie which deserves more credit and will be a movie that you will appreciate owning for repeated viewing!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I love the twist of how the zombie  apocalypse would occur. Told from various points of view and how each country handles it. I was very entertained.
B009KHDT0C|1.0|Dark Shadows, for those of you who aren't familiar with it, was a weak soap opera show of the late sixties/early seventies.  It had its moments but was basically over-acted, low budget and full of fluff.<br /><br />It shows the utter desperation of Hollywood that anyone would consider this show to be worthy of a reboot.  The film most horrific moment is when you realize that you've just wasted almost two hours of your life that you will never get back.<br /><br />This film has NOTHING going for it.  Johnny Depp overwhelms the entire cast who seem to be little more than ghosts in their roles.  This point is especially clear when you realize that the great romance of this film revolves around Barnaby (Johnny Depp) and the governess who has about three minutes of screen time.  At the end of the film, we are supposed to feel something for this tragic couple but I'm not sure why.<br /><br />The plot is so pointless that the viewer is subjected to good chunks of time when nothing but mayhem is going on.  I don't mean anything exciting just things getting broken, burning, flying around - whatever.<br /><br />The antagonist is about the only character who has any fire to her.  She has this incredible, unlimited power to effect the world around her and apparently only has the vision to 1.) stalk a boring vampire and 2.) take over the fishing industry.  Wow, that pretty much says it all.<br /><br />This is one of the most miserable wastes of time that anyone could endure and I encourage viewers to run from it.  The Tim Burton-Johnny Depp-Danny Elfman+++ crew need to move onto new projects, preferably something in another industry.
B000001FDK|5.0|I got all the music that are on the movie and the recording is super good  , It sound like if it was recorded recently
0525953590|5.0|As always Sean Carroll can make any subject pretaining to physics interesting. As a mathematician, I love this book. I think anyone will be able to read and understand the information. Very well written.
1557048630|5.0|If you liked the movie you’re going to love this book. It’s by all means an art book. I highly recommend it.
159420411X|5.0|Suggest to anyone liking maths or just figuring things out. Very interesting on Stastistics and Information Technoloy. A great read.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Awful app for the kindle fire. Won't load more then a page of mini feed and doesn't fully load the mini feed either.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Great story, wonderful acting, tour the real India and a perfect ending, makes for a wonderful entertaining evening.<br />Loved it.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|This app is so much fun and totally worth getting especially since I got it for free. It's fun for any age.
B0042KA4VO|5.0|I am a serious Ian Somerhalder fan, so when he was cast as Damon Salvatore in the CW's The Vampire Diaries, I had to watch, now I'm hooked. Need I say more.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Wonderful to share year after year with children and grandchildren from 2 years old and upwards. Make chex mix, and snuggle in for a special time.
B0044KJIIC|5.0|What can I say, we are Smallville fans. If you have one season, you need them all, that's what I say.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|After watching this mini-series on television, I read the book, which became my favorite. Characterizations are so witty & rich, set amid the usual western landscapes. Bad things happen to good people & that's the way real life is.
0345525558|5.0|The Language of Flowers was a heart tugging read! Such a great story of the importance of others in our lives to encourage and help along the way.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|I Love all Transformers movies so far. I am a huge Fan of Transformers. I have owned the previous two on Blu-ray and I bought this last one on Black Friday's deal. If you are a Fan of Transformers BUY this especially on Blu-ray.It is worth it;)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The end thats why but I like gale better...I wanted her to stay with gale he just my better choice.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I used to love the adventure games I used to play in the early days of personal computers, so I've been trying out some of the Android adventure games recently out of nostalgia. After trying around 10 different adventure apps, this was the first one I can say I liked.<br /><br />It was fun, had a cute story, and I liked the season changing motif. It was a mixture of simple and challenging. There were a couple spots where I had to use the hints and I don't think it would have been possible to know what to do next, or at least in what order, without the hints unless you simply got lucky (I don't want to give any spoilers here so I won't be specific). That's the main reason for one less star. I try to never use hints and think a puzzle should be able to be completed without them and without just luck.<br /><br />However, since there are hints available (included in the app) at least it was not one of those frustrating situations where a puzzle is unsolveable. My only other disappointment is actually also a positive statement about the game. I wish there was more to it because I wanted to keep playing. I don't know if the dev plans on adding new adventures to it, which would be great, but it seems more likely it is one of those self-contained finite games that will not be added to. Looking at the other app by this dev, it also is said to be short, so without any other info, I'd assume this is all there is.<br /><br />Overall, I liked it and would consider trying the other app by this app maker. I'd encourage the dev to make the games longer, but as long as they don't charge more than 99 cents, I think it's still acceptable.
0061125970|3.0|This is a very small book, not the larger version I had seen in stores.  I was disappointed, but it will be a great book for the car.
B0029QRA1U|3.0|Initial set up with the software and the turntable was a little difficult for me. It was confusing in the directions which application is best and finally downloaded EZ Vinyl to computer. Once the software was installed it was fairly simple to record., for there were two red buttons to press to record. Although I selected the recording of the LP to separate the songs it did not do I end up with one track which is one side of the LP. There were no other controls to adjust balance, tone, bass, etc. Two button recording is simple and recordings are as expected as with missed groove sounds and scratches. But I can now play my old records on my Apple products. I would recommend the Ion Turntable to anyone wanting to save the LP music to the new devices.
3836522845|5.0|It's just amazing book. I can't believe that it cost me only $25. Seriously, I would pay much more for it. Big book, big colorful good quality pages. Not full his collection, but a lot of great works of LaChapelle.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I am a fan of Michael Connelly and I truly enjoy the exploits of H. Bosh.  This novel doesn't disappoint; the suspense is kept from beginning to end.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I'm not having any problems with the free version of this battery app. I especially like the way it tells me the various times I have left.
B009RI4FRU|3.0|After watching the trailer, I knew this was going to be kind of a quirky, odd movie, which is great because that's the kind of comedy I like. This movie at least succeeded in being different, but I kept waiting for it to get not only funny, but more interesting. The two main kids' characters are almost robot-like, speaking in short monotone sentences. I understand that was part of the characters -- not bad acting -- but it got old pretty fast. Overall, I'd have to agree with what a few other reviews here said: The movie was OK, but the best stuff is in the trailer.
B00881VLCE|3.0|...on the Vinci tablet. I can not blame the App because the Vinci tablet is the worst piece of junk on the market. Too bad because my kid loves puzzles. I gave it three stars because it's not fair to give it more or less.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Huge fan.  I bought it as a gift for a family member and after they watched it, they let me borrow it.  Great acting, great story.  And it's based on actual American history.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is fast paced and fun.  It is hard enough to keep me interested yet easy enough to pick up quickly
B0055SWM08|5.0|Like the music, graphics and the game itself. Nice to have a relaxing game to play that looks great on my tablet and doesn't have stupid in game purchases.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I think this app is great and like it a lot. It good enough for just looking for things on eBay, but it's when you're in the bidding war is when this app really comes in handy. You can look at all of your items you're currently bidding on and control min/max bids from the phone and be alerted each time something happens instantly.<br /><br />Sometimes the notifications can get a little annoying but you can control them of course from the preferences. If you use eBay a lot and need to stay current while on the go, this app is absolutely perfect and I highly recommend it
B004W4N55C|4.0|I purchased Ultimate Guitar Tabs and Ultimate Guitar Tools when they were separate apps. I use both and I use them all the time. If you are familiar with Ultimate Guitar website, you will feel right at home with this app. You can look up a song, just like on the website. And you can change the key of the song with one touch. With the tools app, you have both a chromatic tuner as well as one you can use by ear. Need to look up a chord? Not a problem. It takes just seconds to look it up and you get both a picture of the fret board with the finger locations and you year how it sounds. You can repeat the sound over and over by \\"thumbing\\" the guitar strings on the screen.<br /><br />I love both apps. My only regret is not waiting and buying this 2 for 1 version, although having them separate isn't a huge deal. If you play guitar, you will use this app all the time.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|I held off reading this for quite some time as I perceived Dawkins would just be &#34;preaching to the choir&#34; with me. Coincidentally, he addresses this very issue in the preface.<br /><br />In any event, I couldn't have been more mistaken. This book was incredibly insightful and profound even for an avowed atheist such as myself.<br /><br />Dawkins also has a knack for comedy, as some of his insights into the absurdity of religion in general had me laughing out loud regularly.<br /><br />Highly recommend.
B00AL8F5EM|5.0|My two favorite things in the book: First, there are many different family situations described in the book, and great examples on how different families (single parent, monolingual, bi-cultural, etc.) go about raising bilingual children. Second, I liked the creative tips to make it fun for kids to learn more than one language.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I LOVE these guys!  I haven't ever heard music that is so moving and engaging!  I have been a Jon Schmidt fan for years and I had the privilege of seeing him play at our school for all the students. It was amazing!  Add the others and you have a brilliant mix!  Amazing musicians, extraordinary videos, and a group of outstanding guys that are not afraid show their passion. Passion as artists and as good, spiritual, loving men!  What great examples!
B006IND5M8|3.0|I get that this is based on a graphic novel, and simply sounded like a good idea to Hollywood. But honestly, as a science fiction nut, I couldn't handle this. It seemed as if they tried to take two different kinds of people and shove them into one movie. What was left was a story that seemed to be trying to figure out how to coexist.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|Yo!!!!!!!  All you peeps out there better listen up,cause boy do I have some news For YOU!!!!!!!  And guess what,,,,,best game ever.  Cause you can do so much on this thing that it's like a real live actuall pet cat!!!!  Sweetness right,check it out yourself.  I won't give it away because it's a suprise.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|As others have written, this is a great book that begins a discussion with positivity. Starting a conversation with &#34;here is my love language&#34; instead of &#34;you could communicate better&#34; makes a huge difference in my mind. So far this book has helped us to not only learn more about each other, but also about ourselves. I highly recommend this book to anyone in a relationship as a start to mending broken bridges.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Great Read !!! I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in police work especially retired detectives. It keeps you guessing and draws you into the investigation to the point that you want to be part of the investigation.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I still can't believe I got this for less than $17. Amazon ad matched Target, and I was able to snag the 4 disc combo set for far less then I should have. No issues with this product, all the blu-ray quality is superb and the extras are quite nice.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I've been a fan of the TV series since day one...glad I found the books. Keeps me up at night.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan if I ever meet you, I may not be able to decide if I want to hug you or slap you. I have read every book you have ever written, and your ability to allow your characters to grow and change over time is fantastic. This book, with seven main characters, truly must have been a challenge to allow for as much development as you allowed.<br /><br />This book ends on yet another cliff hanger, but I tip my hat to you for being able to keep me addicted. I love your writing, and will still buy the book the moment it comes out. Please let me know how many other books are in this series so that I can know my time frame for being worried about my favorite couple.<br /><br />If you have read the other books in this series, then you HAVE to read this one. Best one of the three. Keep it up!
B0063IH60K|3.0|Love the game, but hate the rude ads that seem to pop up at times. Really interferes with the flow of the game. Very irritating...Makes one decide not to even look at them.
B0055SWM08|3.0|This game is alright. Not my favorite, and although the quality is good, I just don't feel a passion to play this game for hours on end.<br /><br />If you are looking for a fun game to keep yourself entertained for a few minutes, then this game can achieve that.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|good game adjustable difficulty easy to use great over all game would be better if game pieces could be changed
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|When I took my girlfriend to see this movie, she left saying it was &#34;a massive game of hide and seek, only with everyone dying, so more like seek and destroy.&#34; I laughed, and moved on. Fast forward to the dvd release, and I decided to give the movie another chance. Having read the books by now, I watched again, and decided they actually did a great job making this book into a movie.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I love playing it and so do the kids.  I won't waste any more of your time with this review.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|When you make a great product you are expected to make another, and another until people are tired of it. Sadly for me, I was tired of it after Seasons. Sure it was fun, but it is the same as Angry Birds, just a few minor changes.
0439023491|5.0|I just ordered this and it is here already!  So it came super fast and is in good condition. My kids love the series and so I know it will be a hit at Christmas.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I, as other Prime Members, use Amazon ALL THE TIME. With that in mind, I love being able to check if sales or deals at stores are really that great when compared to amazon. The scan feature truly has helped me keep track of prices for items. The interface works well, and doesn't make you cringe as some other apps do. Keep it up Amazon!
B000063Y8F|5.0|I was thrilled to get this garlic press.  After my other one broke I was looking for a sturdy press that wouldn't let me down.  This is just the thing.  It is sturdy, even heavy I'd say and works great.  The cleanup is a little fussy but not any worse than any other designed press.  I really love it and expect to have it the rest of my life.  Also came very quickly.
1451627289|5.0|Half the fun is reading the whole book. This book is amazing. I have run out of words of praise for Stephen King's mind and talents. I simply cannot imagine how he can write so many different books that flow together so seamlessly. I'll never get tired of reading his stuff, and thousands agree with me.
0486268659|5.0|Love this classic and got it as a required reading book for my 13 yr old son.  He breezed through it.
B002ZG980U|3.0|I wanted to love this movie, but as many times as I try to watch it, I can't seem to follow it. It has been on cable free TV several times since I bought the DVD but I still can't seem to pull the story together and watch it all the way through.
006056251X|5.0|BEST book in the Wallflower series. Top notch hero and heroine!<br /><br />Highly recommended...A must read..so if you haven't read this one yet, read this today! It's a treat!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I bought this at the urging of my husband. I am 60. I was mildly interested until I realized the heroine was the same age and descriprion as my college student daughter! I became grossed out. Would SHE sign up with a billionaire for kinky kept sex? Yuck!
0380820846|5.0|Colin is and always will be our favorite Bridgerton...and I've loved Penelope from the start!<br /><br />Highly recommended...A must read..so if you haven't read this one yet, read this today! It's a treat!
B005COO1X6|5.0|Great imaginative short story! Evil &#34;car&#34; must be an offspring of Christine and Buick 8. I loved the timely reference to &#34;Words With Friends&#34; too. Always a smart kid is in the right place at the right time. Don't miss this story.
1609611543|4.0|I purchased this book because I was curious about this concept of \\"gluten free\\" diets.  I found the book to be full of information almost to the point of being overwhelming.  I found myself reviewing areas that I have already read over just to be sure that I was fully understanding it.  I was skeptical in the beginning of trying this change in my diet, but I assumed that I could \\"cheat\\" occasionally and still feel fine.  But once starting to seriously eliminating wheat, I can't even sneak a taste of something without feeling even a small side effect.  I appreciate the recipes and guidelines at the end of the book, they were very instrumental in helping me stay on track.  I feel great after following this change in my life and I tell everyone who will listen about the improvements in my health after chosing to take this path to a better lifestyle.
B004LROUNG|5.0|This book will grab you in the first chapter and you just KNOW he will find those Nasty Teeth! A streamlined and fast Grisham novel, waiting for you to run through it barefoot.
B0091THRCU|4.0|you have to stretch it out first! if you don't, it is going to be a tight fit. Otherwise I love the case.
B005PK553C|5.0|Love this series. Good story line and surprises. Characters are well developed and I always can't wait for the next episode.
B007UWBQEU|5.0|As a lover of Carrie since AI, I finally was able to buy it after a long few months. Every track is stunning. Carrie Underwood's vocals are beyond comparison and the diversity is amazing. Some tracks, like her single Blown Away, are very pop-ish but are definitely not pop. Then, with some of her most country tracks ever like &#34;Wine After Whiskey&#34; and &#34;Cupid's Got A Shotgun&#34;, she definitely grounds the album right back into her country genre. I sure do hope this album, along with the Blown Away tour, get her another entertainer of the year and much, much more.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Enjoyed, It's a lot of fun to play and the price is for sure the best it can be, yep.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is a terrifically good game and I think it is one of the best games in the world!!<br /><br />14<br />aloha_rose by a new comment your own site and to the public domain name and to the
1400069289|5.0|I really appreciate the research that has gone into producing this book. With all the research though the information is presented in a way that it is easy to follow. Once you start reading you are just eager to continue reading.<br />This book is a benchmark for depth of content, flow of material, and ease of understanding. This book has the ability to be a life changer
0486275590|5.0|As a child, I saw the Disney movie when it first came out.  Later, I read the Classics Illustrated (comic book) version.  It was not until I was 23 years old and in the Navy that I finally got around to actually reading the book itself in the edition with the Wyeth illustrations.  I found it to be a perfect masterpiece.  Of course, I was already familiar with the characters and the plot, so nothing came as a surprise  One oddity of my childhood was that I somehow managed to get through it without reading any of the classic books except in comic book form, so it was only in my twenties that I went back and read the actual books.  I visited Scotland and toured a museum in Edinburgh devoted to Burns, Scott and Stevenson.  Among other items, I remember that there was a rocking-horse that belonged to Stevenson as a child.  Adults reading this book need to find an essay by Stevenson on the internet titled A Humble Remonstrance, which sort of goes with this book, but would be boring to a child.  In the 1960s I remember being on a bus that was going along a causeway in Miami, and one of the artificially-created islands of the causeway was Treasure Island.  There was a boy on the bus who said to his mother that he was sure that this was the real Treasure Island.  Fortunately she didn't spoil his opinion with the rude truth.  Recently I was talking with a trio of teenagers and told them that this was my favorite book.  They responded in a rude fashion and declared that it was boring.  I suppose that they had been forced to read it in school, a process which seems to invariably backfire in its well-meaning attempt to cast pearls before swine.  Stevenson was looked down upon by intellectuals for a long time because he was popular and wrote for the young, but eventually even the snobs had to admit that he was a fine writer.  The real treasure of Treasure Island is the book itself.
B0014XCMVM|4.0|Just for Torch alone, I say BUY. Not As We is wonderful. No this is NOT Jagged Little Pill. It's Flavors Of Entanglement.It can stand alone for judgement. I say it's a buy. It was slow to grow on me but it did. I've never been sorry for this purchase. There are songs that I don't respond to like I do the ones mentioned but they are still worth listening too. They are not \\"we'll skip passed that one.\\" It's a joyful CD. Buy it. Listen to it. Enjoy.
B009F1ZYCO|5.0|This album sounds great and the package is excellent. Think back to 1979...in my opinion this album was the beginning of the speed  metal era..First albums from Anthrax Metallica (the list goes on) credit Iron Maiden as influences...great job on the release. As with all of the Iron Maiden releases this item is of highest quality and a good value for fans! Up the Irons!
B008FSCNTK|5.0|I don't care how you classify this CD, pop/jazz whatever it doesn't matter. I have been listening to it non-stop since I received it. I have all Diana's CD's so I know what she's done in the past. Who cares? This CD, Glad Rag Doll is wonderful. It's jazzy, it's got kick. It'll get you off your couch cutting a rug. To me it's highly addictive and very enjoyable. Some of you need to give it another chance.<br /><br />A Little Mixed Up 5 Stars<br />Lonely Avenue 5 Stars<br />Prairie Lullaby 5 Stars<br />Wide River To Cross 5 Stars<br />There Ain't No Sweet Man That's Worth The Salt Of My Tears 5 Stars<br />You Know, I Know Ev'rything's Made For Love 5 Stars<br />Let It Rain 5 Stars<br /><br />There really is no dud on this CD. Maybe it's a bit different. Get out of your rut and learn something new. I'm sure Glad Diana did. She's wonderful and this CD is too. Give it another chance. For those on the fence about buying this. Stop hesitating and get it. You'll be glad you did.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|Great Sound Quality on a Budget.<br />Very Durable for me and very comfortable.<br />I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for decent headphones on a budget!
B00723NWJE|5.0|You read: \\"It's like all the others\\" or \\"It's different from the others.\\" So which is it? In my Opinion, Who cares? This CD \\"Little Broken Hearts is wonderful. I've had it since it's release and have listened to his numerous times since it's arrival. I have everything Norah has put out that I know of and this is great.<br /><br />Take it back, Happy Pills, Out On The Road and After The Fall are rare gems worth the cost of the CD all by themselves. There are others that are will worth listening too as well. There really isn't a bad song on the disk. Get it and give it a try. Not just once. You do not do justice to most CDs by just a once over.  I'm very glad I made this purchase.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Great read.  Hard to put it down.  I am a Mitch Rapp fan!  hAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED IN FLYNN.  cAN HARDLY WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOOK.
B0096DZKZC|5.0|Loved it.  My 4 year old loves to play it.  Very fun.  Glad to introduce him to Sonic.  My 23 year old was a sonic nut and it brought back lots of memories.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|Another high quality Griffin charger! It works as it should, I have family and friends with after market Lightning units that haven't lasted a month. I wanted a one-piece charger, and at the time of purchasing my iPhone 5, Apple did not have one.<br /><br />Overall another quality piece from Griffin.<br /><br />One month follow-up: This charger is still going strong with daily use in the car. This is truly as high quality as my other Griffin chargers and my Griffin Survivor case.
B005NJU8PA|4.0|This is not a cooking book. It is mentioned several times in the book. If you can tolerate some obsessive self development war stories you are good to go. However it is quite a nice cook book anyway.<br /><br />The most dominant problem is that the contents of the book are very dispersed. Cooking, recipes, cooking skills, how to learn language, basics of fire arms, basics of creating fire with two wooden sticks, dancing, learning a language... taking your things to extreme.<br /><br />However, the book is well written and quite entertaining. And the recipes are good - especially the 198 small recipes from all around the world. And there are lots of good wonderful tips you cannot find else where and a collection of very good pointers for addtional information.<br /><br />If you want a steady course over some basic recipes, pick something else. Gordon Ramsay's Utlimate Cookery Course or anything from Jamie Olivier 30 minute meals is most probably better. If you wan't some scientific (or nerdic) touch of things, pick this one. And Cooking for Geeks as well.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|OK....so can they make this any easier????  What a change from the OLD DAYS of uploading and templates...anyone can sell or buy ...a breeze
B004XDYJRU|5.0|With this app you can listen to any radio station in any country in any part of the world. I was born and raised in NY and now live in FL and I hate FL radio, but w/ this app, I can listen to my favorite stations in NYC. I'm so happy!!!
B007BZM3HK|5.0|Just love this song.  Fun and nice song to get caught in your head somedays! Wish every song on the market had such an effect on everyone.
B009KHCT94|4.0|I followed its production over the internet for two years.  I like the idea that it was made over the internet and crowd funded
B004XDYJRU|4.0|Used this program for over a year on my iPhone and loved it.  Unfortunately due to licensing some of the stations that I grew to love were removed from the playlist; but listeners were diverted to similar stations.<br /><br />Some things I miss from iTunes version:  1) Record setting has a timed stop on iTunes but I can't seem to find it on the android version.  2) Record button results in the recording showing up in the recordings page immediately in iTunes - Andriod ap seems to wait until the recording is finished - not a fan since I can't really see that the recording is active.<br /><br />Otherwise, Fantastic ap.  Just understand when you see negative reviews that it's not the ap that doesn't play the stations, it's licensing changes (I believe clear channel is the culperate) that resulted in the stations being removed.<br /><br />Hope this helps!
B00992CF6W|5.0|best game ever it is so fun i have wasted to many hours playing this dumb game but it so freaking
B00846REIS|2.0|I think Ms Day must have read the Fifty Shades of Grey blog before she wrote this book. Same story line with a few changes here and there but seems to be the same story, young millionair that owns half the buildings and businesses in town, serious emotional issues and alarmingly gorgeous!! Then the beautiful irresistable young woman comes along that he JUST has to have, blah, blah, blah................ Oh, and the very graphic sex. This book was one trilogy to late!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love this book! I can not put it down! It's too good! I hope they make a good moviegoers out  of it!
B004S5FW1U|3.0|Left too many gaps for too long.  Was an ok read but left a bit to be desired.  Characters too odd.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|I received the DVD sooner than expected, I was a little worried about the DVD being scratched or just totally ruined, but it was in perfect condition. The case was a little banged up, but that's not a big deal.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love The Walking Dead and this season is just getting started! Can't wait until Feb! I just hope that nothing happens to Daryl because he is my favorite!
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Don't miss this movie. I'm usually not a fan of sequels, but this is every bit as good as the first and second.
B009GEEMLY|4.0|This was an entertaining movie, but not my favorite out of all the comic book films. It's definitely worth watching.
0439023521|5.0|Really entertaining book, hard to put down. i highly reccomend it. . . . .  . .  . . .
B004EBT5CU|5.0|WONDERFUL<br /><br />What can I say, Adele has a marvelous voice and I enjoy the CD immensely.  I can't wait to purchase more by her.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Awesome... now I have to go back and what the movies of the other characters that I missed. Never saw Thor, but I think I may check it out now.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Enjoyed the book but he comes across as little self centered and all his family and friends walk on water.
B0085MNZ66|5.0|It's pretty easy to learn the concept of mixing colors to complete the puzzles however as the puzzles get more difficult this easy game can be a real challenge. I've been enjoying playing it and there are times when I've had to put it down and come back because it has me stumped. If you like puzzle/maze games that require some planning give Pigment a try.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Only in America this could be a bestseller. I do not understand it. It is soooo simpleminded and boring. If you have any taste please do not read it.
B009A87Z6U|5.0|I know that many people didn't love this Bond movie but I really did. I think it's a great introduction to the broken man who is James Bond. Everything he touches withers and dies. He must cope with this and still do his job.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book drew me in instantly and I could not put it down.  It's a good story that had me turning the pages to find our what was going to happen.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|This was fascinating in many ways because it describes the actions taken in a real-life battle to take down a deadly enemy.  However, there is way too much padding about the way SEALs live and work.  This book should have been edited down to a shorter, more concise, harder hitting tale.  The actual death of Bin Laden is far from dramatic, but I understand that often in real life, momentous events are actually anticlimactic.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Connelly's characterization of Harry Bosch is excellent.  We see his strengths and weaknesses throughout this novel.  His inability to get along with his bosses, his dedication to justice for the victims, his difficult relationship with his teenage daughter, his concern about his lack sensitivity to the people he encounters, all bring a realism to the character that is not found in many detective novels.  Add to that a twisted plot that leads you in one direction, only to slam the door and force you in another direction, and you have an outstanding yarn that is very entertaining.
B003EV6DBW|5.0|incredible season, matt smith (nobody will ever equal Tennant) is fantastic.  moffat a genius as always.  buy this now please ;)
B0076DEJMO|4.0|In Red Country, Joe makes use of all the lessons he learned when writing the Heroes. But what made the Heroes such a great book has the opposite effect here.<br /><br />In the Heroes, Joe used far more numerous point of view characters than is typical of his previous books to paint a picture of a battle from every angle. The clarity of movement is crystal clear. No side truly good or evil, and there are triumphs and tragedies on both sides.<br /><br /> The saying goes that you never know what its like to be someone until you've walked a mile in their shoes. But people lie to themselves all the time, and some people even have multiple pairs of shoes. Joe uses viewpoint brilliantly in the Heroes to create real people. This realism comes from showing the difference between how these people perceive themselves and how their friends and enemies perceive them. Neither views are completely true; the truth is somewhere in between.<br /><br />That same technique is employed far more extensively in Red Country, but to far less effect. Joe lets us try on a whole lot of shoes this time around; Red Country is practically a foot locker of POVs. But while the Heroes used viewpoint to deepen our understanding of the main cast or to show a clearer picture of a chaotic battle, Red Country's  POVs are lead boots that result in a shallower main cast, a padded word count, and plodding pace.<br /><br />There are simply too many characters this time around with to little to do. I couldn't remember all of them, much less care about them. It's too hard to effectively establish the personality of a character in one or two pages, and its especially too much to ask the reader to care once it becomes obvious that this person will probably never figure into the story again.<br /><br />The Heroes restricted its use of these scattered minor viewpoints; when they appeared, there was always goal in sight. The famous sequence in the Heroes where characters are introduced in the midst of a battle onlyto be killed a page later had obvious purpose--it establishes a trend, and soon enough the reader knows the that a character they know and care about will be the POV. The purpose was obvious. It was like a race towards a finish line, and the longer it went on the pace and the anticipation actually increased.<br /><br />In Red Country, the POV sequences aren't a purposeful race; they're a ponderous stampede with no end in sight. The people who are introduced might as well be cattle for all I could care for them.<br /><br />This problem rears its head as soon as Shy and Lamb join up with a caravan headed to the Far Country; the pacing slows unbearably as each and every member of the caravan are introduced in their own POV segment. The use of POV snippets here is a misstep, but an understandable one. Unfortunately, it gets worse from there. The technique is utilized again and again, until it feels like authorial laziness for not constructing a plot where the necessary details could have been perceived by the main cast.<br /><br />Shy becomes a one note character very soon, capable only of spitting at things through the gap in her teeth. Temple shows promise of depth, but is never given real opportunity to come alive.<br /><br />The plot veers between wanting to be Blood Meridian, wanting to be Going Postal, and wanting to be Red Dead Revolver, but is never as interesting as any of its influences. The stolen children, who served as the call to action of the book, end up feeling more like what they are: an excuse to get Shy and Lamb moving. That plot line, the children's  plight and the reveal of their captors, is perhaps the most unfulfilling portion of the book.<br /><br />There is far more navel gazing and philosophizing in this novel than Joe has ever included before.<br /><br />Thankfully, Lamb and Cosca provide some of the best lines in any of Abercrombie's books. They never have a viewpoint, but when the crosshairs of the story settle on them, even momentarily, its a relief.<br /><br />Cowardice is the dominant theme of the book, but it is an unsuccessful theme. Only Lamb's plot seems to have anything interesting to say on the subject.<br /><br />With experimentation there are inevitably some failures.<br />What surprised me about Red Country is that what I had expected to be its biggest problem is actually it's least; the switch to spaghetti western style dialogue mostly works. Sometimes it feels the same as when an american guy trying to pull off a british accent, but I was intrigued by the culture change, and I am extremely curious as to where Joe will be headed with his next book.<br /><br />Red Country is my least favorite of Joe Abercrombie's books, which may sound like an insult. But when your literary career has been as shining as Joe's, having one subpar book is hardly something to be worried about. I hope Joe keeps experimenting with his next book and keeps trying to push the boundaries of genre. But it wouldn't be too bad a thing for a return to some of the younger, simpler Joe on structural side of things.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|this app is amazing I love it this app lets u design everything and anything ! ! ! ! ! ! !
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Overall, it was a great book. Awesome plot layout and many suspenseful moments. You should definitely read this book and encourage others to read it.
B00919V2ZS|5.0|This records, along with &#34;Broadway the hard way&#34; and &#34;The best band you ever heard&#34; are a trilogy that shows the last live band of Mr. Zappa. Full of musicianship and fun. Recommended!!!!
B005HS00V4|5.0|Great vision. AMAZING sound. All hits, re-imagined and played live with an orchestra. Some dislike this last records of Gabriel, but I think they are top level.
B00004YRBC|5.0|I just recently came to know this band, and I cannot stop listening their records. I bought at the same time 3 of their 4 studio records, all in vinyl. Amazing.
B009DQQDEO|5.0|I just recently came to know this band, and I cannot stop listening their records. I bought at the same time 3 of their 4 studio records, all in vinyl. Amazing.
B008I34XUY|5.0|What a great record this is. It came from, I think, the very best period of Frank Zappa. All the band is in top form, and the compositions are all very interesting and funny at the same time.
B002NUZ93S|4.0|This record is full of atmospheres. Is for listening in a room with the lights out, and a glass of wine in your hand. Recommended
B008K7WCJM|5.0|I came to this band through Steven Wilson, who said that this record in particular was the best record of 2012 &#34;by some margin&#34;. He is 100% right!!!
B005FNSJDC|5.0|This is the best record of the last 20 years. It's an amazing piece of art. It cannot be better than this. Forget the PT comparission. This is Steven Wilson, the best artist of music alive.
1557048630|5.0|This is the most interesting book. Seeing the concept art is a treasure because it really shows all the work that goes into making an animated film like this. I love all of &#34;The Art of...&#34; books and will be purchasing more in the future. Dreamworks you are awesome.
B00A2IUHM6|3.0|The regular R version gets 5 stars, it is Hilarious, and great quality.<br /><br />Quality is what you won't get from the Streaming version however, even when I downloaded the 2 GB file of it, it seemed blocky still. Very annoying. I paid $15 for the streaming version and now... I'm probably going to have to buy the DVD so I can actually have good quality.<br /><br />Now the Unrated version...<br /><br />The R version is great, and I am not offended by &#34;Bad Language&#34;, However, the Unrated version doesn't add much to the movie, but for the most part alternative takes that add language, and at the point, the language does become overkill. When you say to yourself, &#34;He just yelled in the R version at the thunder, he didn't say 5 obscenity's&#34; theres only one added scene in the unrated version that I feel really adds anything at all to the movie, and it's only 20-30 seconds. For those who haven't seen it yet, I'll just say &#34;Basement&#34;.
B004EYT932|3.0|I bought this book expecting (hoping for?) an anecdotal history of financial crises but found it to be an occasionally mind-numbing statistical analysis of vast numbers of financial meltdowns, currency crises, debasements, and inflation bouts over the past 800 years. Overall, it provides a useful view of commonalities between financial crises (including the &#34;Second Great Contraction&#34; of 2007-2008. Its primary shortcoming is its lack of engaging format. That said, if you're interested in this area of macroeconomic analysis, it's worth the read. Just don't forget your coffee.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I have loved this series since I first saw it on History channel. To get it at such a great price is unbeliveable!
B00005N6KG|5.0|I have small ear canals, so in-ear headphones are very uncomfortable. These are so lightweight and flexible you hardly remember you are wearing them (which can lead to some painful mishaps!). Love them!
B004EBZX6W|2.0|No significant difference in signal. Try it for your own. Then forget if you done find anything improvement. It's free.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Sadly, everything in this book is predictable. Characters, plot, actions, everything. It's an amusing read and a nice escape, but if you're looking for solid storytelling, this is not it.
B007AJFSJW|1.0|This book, and especially its author, should be sold as comedy. His idea to spend (print) more money because the Federal Reserve has no more options (lower interest rates which are already near zero) is absolutely ludricous. Easy credit is what caused the mess, and only painful conservative monetary policies will ever fix it. Save your money and read some of Ron Paul's books if you want to know the real problem.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I started this series at the request of my wife, who insisted I give them a read. Sadly, everything in this book as well as the first is predictable. Characters, plot, actions, everything. It's an amusing read and a nice escape, but if you're looking for solid storytelling, this is not it. I was hoping the sophomore effort would show progress as a writer. I was disappointed on this end as well.
B008NR8YTQ|4.0|Excellent CD from Gary Moore. Hendrix songs from a guitar great Gary Moore. The band is very good, and Gary is just fantastic! I am a big fan of both Jimi and Gary and have been since both guitarist started out.
B005IQZB14|3.0|The story is good, but the book is long and drawn out.  I enjoyed parts of it and felt it was inspiring!
B002RI9ZPY|4.0|Wordy & hard to get into but very well written & intriquing story.<br />Once into story found it hard to put down.
1451638450|5.0|Love it, love it, love it! I've been waiting for a new Vorkosigan book for what feels like forever, and this was definitely worth the wait. It's a great story, it's about Ivan-you-idiot, who as it turns out is not such an idiot, and it's a great romance. If you're worried about not having read any previous books in the series, don't be - I think you could jump right in and enjoy this just as much, but then do go back and read the others to catch up.  Bujold writes science fiction with such a human touch that I think even those who \\"don't read science fiction\\" will enjoy her books, especially from Komarr on.  Read it, read it, read it!

1451695195|5.0|I was always a true believer but the accounts of NDE's always uplift me in my Belief. This book is written by a Doctor which always adds more excitement to the account. It is so good to see that some in the medical community are willing to recognize these accounts. Thanks for sharing with us Dr. Alexander. God bless you and your family.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|After discovering the Piano Guys about a year ago, My husband and I have been hooked on it. Fortunately, listening to them on cd is just as wonderful as watching their videos!
B0053O89RY|5.0|How could you not love Modern Family.  Truly one of the best Comedy Series on television.  Highly recommended for some great laughs.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|Such a lovely story about a snowman who comes to life and takes a little boy on a trip into his world and back.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|Usually a remake of an original does not pass the test of being better.  This one certainly does surpass the original although both versions are great.  If you like Natalie Wood then the original version is for you.  This one with Richard Attenborough will certainly warm your heart.  The entire cast was perfect for this movie. Enjoy!
B0029XFNA8|5.0|i love the this movie it is a great family classic! it is a great all around christmas movie and family movie
B00ADS98FC|4.0|Definitely a PG-13 flick, this over-the-top story of a talented DJ who discovers the Accapella Diva within is well worth adding to the DVD library. Crazy talented men and women, some sweet relationship development and just enough raunchiness from the ladies to to keep any viewer on their toes, this is a movie that one will watch over and over and over again. Sure, it's a movie with a bunch of pretty people set at a college that looks nothing like reality, but hey . . . stranger things have been made believable on the silver screen.

B0020M99LC|5.0|This was the best Bond movie I have seen since the beginning.<br />Daniel Craig is the best actor to play Bond since the start of<br />the Bond movies, including the first Bond actor Sean Connery.
B009B8YZKS|4.0|This show is well worth the money for the complete series that went up on Youtube and XboxLive. Some shoddy acting, yes, but I must give the actors credit for making a badass show to prequel Halo 4.
B009VB97EY|5.0|Very good movie for a woman, not so good for the Christian woman though. But besides the stripper part I liked the story line.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Like mentioned in other reviews, the news feed won't load more than like ten or fifteen posts. Everything else is blue. Update needed!!
B004VD3YIM|1.0|I have been a User of tiny cam for a year now. I was very satisfied with the app and have it installed on my Droid X as well.  The issue started after the latest update to tiny cam.  The app will start to bring up my security cam's and promptly lock up the fire. The kindle fire then must be hard reset by holding the power button in tell it shuts off.  I see other reviews with the same issue and it has been at enough time to pull the update and fix it. Come on people at least make the previous update available.
B000IMUYJM|4.0|This is a great classic horror film that falls between the original Psycho and the original Halloween as one of the first &#34;slasher&#34; movies.  The characters are pretty likeable (unlike the 2006 version) and fun.  The killer is really creepy but left to the shadows for the most part.  If you can appreciate older horror movies then I say you should give this one a try.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|It works for me. I can see the weather first thing when I get up and the weeks forecast. The colors are beautiful on the display and I just love it.
B008NMT684|5.0|My daughter (3) loves puzzles. She really enjoys dragging the pieces over to fit the spaces. I think this is the one with the bubbles at the end; that is a great reward of fun for the child too!
0375869026|5.0|This is in the top 5 books that I have ever read, let alone my 9-yr old son. We read this together - laughed, cried, incredible!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I was told to see the movie first, and thought it incredible!!!  However, the book was so well writen don't think<br />it was necessary. Mr Martel did such a excellent job of writing to put you inthe scene that I felt I was there.<br />Can't wait to see the movie again.
B007N9FKCY|1.0|Mimics much better games with bad results. Even free, not worth your time. No one want to be a racist bean.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My family loves the Walking Dead. We have watched everyone of them and are looking forward for more to come. It is so suspenseful and keeps us watching and wondering whats gonna happen next. Love it

B008JGSM6G|4.0|Great game for passing time and focusing your brain.  Kids love it.  Flow Free is the most used game on my tablet.
B007HC3LHS|3.0|Haynes did have a great way of making the reader understand the horror, panic, isolation, and lack of control the main character experiences, but I thought the outcome was rather predictable and almost unsatisfying. In the end it almost felt like an episode of Law & Order (which might be a good thing for you but not so much for me).  That being said, it did have enough suspense and a couple unexpected twists to be a good read.
B00782O7NE|5.0|Good seller. Product arrived on time and in perfect condition as described. Would buy again.<br /><br />Great product. Blu-ray quality was great, beautiful movie. Blu-ray definitely worth it in terms of enhancing dramatic shots and emphasizing beauty of silent films.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|Wonderful for staying connected on a professional level. I own a Commercial Collection Agency, Lions and Associates, and it is important to keep my contacts close.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I Absolutely love this group. Must have album for every persons collection. Every song I listen to is consistently done better then the next.  You won't be disappointed.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is a must have application, there are so many books to choose from in the Amazon Kindle Library, and some books are even free.
B00AAAKH80|5.0|This album rocks! Many of the songs sound similar to their single Cruise with a good mix of ballad type songs too. I'm a huge Eric Church fan and I think this album has a total rock and roll country sound like Eric Church. Highly recommend this album:)
1451695195|5.0|I read this book in one sitting. It is 188 pages long. It took me about one hour and 45 minutes. I am a Christian and I have always believed in Life after Death so that was my primary reason for wanting to read this book which has been recommended by so many reviewers and critics. If you are not a person of Faith then this book may not change that because even this book is still Faith based. Dr. Eben Alexander is an accomplished Neurosurgeon who is the author and the subject of this book. The journey recounts the brief After Life journey taken by Dr. Alexander while his mortal body remained on Earth in a hospital attended by family, colleagues and friends struggling to survive. The actual After Life journey by the spirit of Dr. Alexander is something that you will richly enjoy if you are a person of Faith so I will not spoil that here. Buy this book and read about the journey. If you are a person of Faith it will be worth it. The terminology is Medical Level at times because Dr. Alexander is a Neurosurgeon but, it fits well with the book. Since the return of the Spirit of Dr. Alexander to his Earthly body he has chosen a new mission in Life; to spread The Word about The After Life!
B000YHG72E|5.0|this movie is destined to be a classic. I would recommend it to anybody!<br />Will Ferrell is a great comedian, and plays the part of Buddy very well.
0440245206|3.0|I have read most of the novels by Ms. Steele. I have looked forward to getting each new book of hers. This book is a total disappointment. It is boring, and poorly written. Ms. Steel's books used to be well written-well developed plots and characters. While, the daughter had an Eloise quality that was cute as a child, she continued that way and it did not make for good character developmet in my opinion.
141659521X|5.0|Loved the book!  But then i love everything he writes...So good to see the bad guys beaten in the end!
1572814349|5.0|I gave these a five star rating because of the artwork on each card.  It is outstanding and I love looking at them. Deck comes with a little history book of each character.  I plan on using them as ideas for my &#34;altered&#34; art and not reading the tarot. I would recommend these to anyone who is a lover of art as well as tarot.
B007N9FKCY|1.0|You play a sombrero-wearing jumping bean named Emilio? I thought this was just a bad joke,but this is a real game? Poor taste &amp; no class Kumobius...
B008ELUEQC|5.0|What can I say? It's ROD, baby! I may be impartial since I've been a Rod Stewart fan since the early 1980's, but he croons these Christmas classics beautifully. If you want something new for your Christmas music collection, this will not disappoint.
B00006J3WH|5.0|This is one of top ten favorite Buffy episodes, the soundtrack is amazing. I really love the instrumental pieces at the end from some of the other best episodes (and Joss's demo song at the end). The only thing that is missing is the theme song, I can't believe they didn't include that!
B009C7JS14|1.0|Couldn't get it to accept a location other than LA<br />Couldn't get it to accept a location other than LA
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Wow, I didn't hear about this for quite a while after it was finished and I'm sorry to have missed it for so long! As with anything Joss Whedon is a part of, the writing and dialogue is superb. So many funny quips, sly comments and all delivered with perfection by three amazing leads (and some awesome support).
0385535147|3.0|Entertaining . That's pretty much it.<br /><br />It starts off pretty somber, but gains momentum as nothing but a commoner and ex con kicking the governments backside and driving off into the sunset with a pot of gold and of course, the woman.<br /><br />If you have read some of Grishams better works like THE PARTNER, you will find many similarities. However, it's still a fun, no stress read.<br /><br />If you desire a more gripping and more intense and realistic plot, I'd stay clear of this one.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Enjoyed the series...ended a bit abruptly.  Overall a good read.  Especially ending most chapters with a teaser to an upcoming event was suspenseful.
B00932A2MC|3.0|Was a cross between Transformers and Pearl Harbor.  The special effects were OK, but the plot and the acting left a little to be desired.  Do I regret watching it?  No... but would I watch it again?  No!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This movie is in my top 5, I've had it on vhs and dvd, but when this came out I had to have it... the picture quality is outstanding, I can't believe they can take a movie that old and make it look that clear
B00150VWX8|5.0|I love Richard Wagner.  I love watching all four of the Ring operas.  I'm not one of those &#34;purists&#34; who can't handle listening to something less than the full operas.  When I just want to listen to some beautiful music, I will listen to this album.  It has many of the major musical leitmotifs or themes from all four of the Ring operas performed as a single, flowing orchestral piece.  There are no words, just beautiful music.  I highly recommend it for anyone that is looking to enjoy the wonderful music but doesn't need to listen to the German lyrics.
B00002SWEM|5.0|I have loved this for years and finally got my own copy, it's great. If you love Cuban people and its culture, this is a must-see!  As always, quick shipping
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I like the Amazon MP3 music player and use it daily.  It is able to access both the SD card on my phone and the cloud player.  Easy interface to use and browse your music.<br /><br />My only gripe is that it puts a delay between tracks even when there isn't one on the original album.  I like to listen to a lot of Frank Zappa and and other classical music (yes, I said Frank Zappa and classical music in the same sentence!) and many of the tracks are supposed to blend from one into the next without a pause.  Itunes and Windows media player can do this, Amazon MP3 player should be able to do it as well.  Try listening to Wagner:\\"The Ring Without Words\\" and the gaps between sections will drive you nuts.  I would give this a 5 star rating if they would fix that problem.<br /><br />UPDATE 1/27/14 - Amazon has updated the MP3 player since I wrote this review.  Now, the player does not insert the delay between tracks and the songs flow smoothly from one to the other.  I can now listen to my Zappa, Beethoven and Wagner as they were meant to be heard - uninterrupted! Highly recommended.
B0076DELIG|5.0|As usual very good.  He is unquestionly the best one writing this kind of novel out there.  The ending is a little fanciful, but I hope that he keeps Harry alive forever.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I gave this Kindle for  Android app 4 stars because it is easy to use, remembers where I left off, has a built in dictionary that is easy to use and I can change the font sizes.  I would recommend this to everyone.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Adorable with a powerful message!  We loved this so much that we went to watch it twice at the movies and then bought the DVD.  :)
B0041VV03A|5.0|Loved the story line the special effects were very good I LOVED IT! me and my husband liked it<br />would buy it...
B005LAJ212|5.0|Great cover art! Totally goes with the show! Love this very, very well written drama. Just cant get enough of Emily and always look forward to the next plot twist (or two). Keep em coming!

B003AYMZO2|5.0|Great show.  Love the extras.  We just wish the show wasn't ending this season!  Can't wait to see the rest of the episodes this season.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Expected another concert film, but it was so much more. Robert, Jimmy, John and Jason, thanks for the fun trip down memory lane . Shame we couldn't get more, but not sure if the world would survive another Zep concert tour. Must have for any Zep fan.
B002ZG99A4|1.0|Ive been every busy this Christmas season. Too have more time, I decided to go online and order some DVDs for family members. Low and behold I didnt receive my gifts. I ordered them from amazon.com LLC and not a private seller. I specifically ordered it from amazon because the items come directly from the manufacture. Guess I was wrong. The order form confirmed my order as delivered but it has been two weeks since the delivered date. I'm very disappointed in Amazon!
0380725398|5.0|I had no experience with Daphne DuMaurier before this book. She was mentioned in a previous novel I read by another author, and I thought her worth a try.<br /><br />I am so glad I picked up this book! While it does not have quite the suspense of Sherlock Holmes (my very favorite detective) it does have plenty of its own kind. I love to solve a mystery and this book left me guessing right up to the end!<br /><br />The romance in the book is not overdone or risque, making this a perfect read for someone more conservative, as well. The characters are well developed, believable, and interesting. I did not want to put it down! I brought it on vacation with me as an \\"outdoor only\\" book (so I would not lose or damage my kindle) and I ended up sitting in my room finishing it because I just couldn't stop! I definitely recommend this read. I would put her in the realm of authors such as Susanna Kearsley or Ciji Ware. Worth a look :)
0061726834|3.0|From Reading and Writing Urban Fantasy and Paranormal Romance<br /><br />At A Glance<br />This is one of the most poetic books I have ever read. It was quite beautiful. Too bad it wasn't as engrossing as I hoped.<br /><br />The Good<br />Here's The Story...<br />Lena has been waiting for this one moment for years. To finally be cured for love. Love is a nasty disease that makes people go crazy. Without love, the world is at peace and no one has to worry about anything as long as the government keeps curing everyone. Then Lena finds out the truth. Love is beautiful, love is amazing, and love is powerful. Love is worth living but the government will never let love \\"infect\\" anyone again. They will brutalize, maim, and kill to keep love from getting out. Lena has fallen in love, but will she survive long enough to enjoy it?<br /><br />Crazy Little Thing Called Love...<br />Love is a disease? Come on, like I wasn't going to try out this book after hearing that. You know for a fact that once you read the book summary, you can't help but pick up this book to see what all the fuss is about. And just a few pages in, I was blown away by the lyrical and poetic quality of writing Delirium had to offer. Oliver knows her way around a word. Sometimes I got lost in the overall rhythm of the book. It's very cohesive and relaxing. I don't think I am describing it right, but trust me, you read this book and you will notice the difference from other books.<br /><br />Lena In Love...<br />Lena really interested me. In the beginning, she's a dream citizen. She wants the procedure that will cure her against love. She wants what the government is spewing, that she will be happy and safe after the procedure. But as she slowly finds out the truth, she becomes an accidental rebel. You think the people around her are the ones who take chances and fight the authority, but Lena grows into an awesome rogue of her own. Especially after meeting Alex. Alex is everything she should be staying away from. But Lena can't stay away from someone so different. He's not like the other \\"robots\\"--what I like to call the cured. When Alex looks into her eyes, Lena's world narrows. All she wants is for them to be together. Through the love they share, Lena empowers herself to take chances, to fight her fate.<br /><br />Alex...<br />Alex is a tricky little bugger. I was a little scared of him at first. I wasn't sure what his deal was. But as I saw his love for Lena grow, I fell in love with him too. He's sweet, deep, and caring. I knew Lena was safe whenever he was around. I found myself wanting to know more about him, about his life before Lena. And I wasn't disappointed. Oliver is really good at providing the information we crave about our characters.<br /><br />The Fam...<br />I was excited to see Oliver added some major drama about Lena's mom and other family members. I would read separate stories for all of them because they each have a story hidden somewhere.<br /><br />Don't Touch My Brain...<br />The world in Delirium was simply terrifying. I would be scared out of my mind to go against the government. These people will kill with glee to keep their world controlled. They mess with people's brains! Not cool. My thinking bits are just fine where they are.<br /><br />This is the End...<br />The ending was pretty awesome. I was so freakin' nervous and excited at the same time. I think the ending was perfect for this book, though some may be a little sad about what happens. I can tell you one thing, you won't be able to stop yourself from buying book 2 because Delirium leaves you desperate for more.<br /><br />The Bad<br />My biggest problem is nothing really happens until page 220. It was so slow. I often found myself bored and just wanting more out of the whole thing. There was so much potential left untapped. The concept is amazing but the plot didn't utilize the uniqueness of the topic. And the descriptions were too long. It was like Oliver was trying to fill in space. This book could have been written in half the pages and been better.<br /><br />The Snuggly<br />The romance was very YAish. I very much enjoyed the the slow build of romance between Lena and Alex. It was extremely sweet...and forbidden.<br /><br />Final Thoughts<br />If it wasn't so boring for a good two-thirds of the book, this would have received a 5 star rating. But not enough happened for me to have fallen in love with Delirium. That being said, I still enjoyed it. I loved the characters and the concept still intrigues me. I might buy the second book someday. Recommend for those who don't mind slow books with great concepts.<br /><br />Quotes<br />\\"I love you. Remember.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|Having a past in psychology (degree, and then working in a psych hospital) I feel this book was totally accurate. The author was able to capture the thought processes and behaviors of someone who might be struggling with a mental illness so well. I am not making a blanket statement that all mental illnesses or people with them are the same, but I am saying there are specific traits that often pop up.<br /><br />Pat Peoples is a lovable character who draws you into his pain, joy, and determination with such ease it's incredible. Tiffany is a fabulous picture of dealing with grief through unconventional outlets. But this understanding of one another is what their friendship is built on.<br /><br />I rarely read something that expresses these issues so well, and I believe that Matt Quick has done a fabulous job. Some readers have said the book is too shallow, too simple, or whatever, but I believe with an understanding of mental illness, this book is a great read. It is worth the $10. Enjoy!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This is a wonderful and entertaining DVD for a kid.  I found it a bit boring but that is not surprising for a 56 year old.  Fast shipping for this product and arrived safely packaged.  A must for young viewers.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I had misgivings about this book when I began. The description was not much of one, and left me wanting more information before I committed $10 to this book. However, a friend recommended it and I am so glad she did! Anybody else have a similar experience?<br /><br />I have read other reviews stating that the book was too long, too detailed, dragged on, etc. However, I believe that this added to the mystery. Morgenstern gave me a fabulous view into the world which she has created. I feel that often times, books are not original anymore, and this flipped my world upside down. This Night Circus with its black and white contrast and majestic feats had me hoping it was real.<br /><br />The characters are intricate and well described, leaving me wondering what more there is to know, how they fit into the big picture. The plot is well designed and the entire time I was reading, I was also trying to put together all the little pieces that I knew hadn't been handed to me yet.<br /><br />The love story is quite perfect. Not explicit, not bawdy, but pure, pleasant, and romantic. Everything I think any woman wants. So yes, this book has my stamp of approval. Spend the $10, you won't regret it. And hey, if it's ever on sale, you will have received quite a bargain!
B001EBYM62|5.0|I purchased this for my dad for Christmas and I am sure he will love it. It is a family favorite.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I originally started on Quell last year, and that game was incredible in its own right. The graphics alone are gorgeous and superbly done, the level of detail put into each screen is absolutely astounding. Some games attempt to be showy and just end up looking busy and confusing, but Quell managed to make it effortless to concentrate on and enjoy. The music is top notch as well, bringing thoughts of a quiet rainy day in a country cottage with accompanying pastoral background. Game ,at was amazing as well, challenging without being frustrating or absurdly odd to solve. This is one of my principle problems wth Angry Birds, for whenever I try to solve a level there is always a frustrating element of chance and the feeling that its just another puzzle to solve. The task is never really enjoyable, just mundane. Quell never fell into that problem, and each puzzle is fresh and challenging while still soothing the mind.<br /><br />I say all that because Quell Reflect improves upon this even more. The addition of multiple rain drops and the new puzzles are brilliantly done. Yes, it is really quite similar to Quell and doesn't bring too many brand new features, but that is like saying Portal 2 was like Portal 1. Both were great games, and only benefited from the resemblance. For a game that is infinitely replayable, ad free in its entirety, and superbly designed and executed, you cannot get much better. There is a reason it has five stars, and is well worth a much higher cost than is being asked.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Another good Jack Reacher story. I've read them all, and I'm a great fan. But can I ever read another Jack Reacher novel with the image of Teeny Tiny Tom Cruise in my head? I'm afraid not!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app works great and gets the job done.  I reccommend you download it and use it. the price is right.
B0012BQ60O|5.0|It's very detailed and slightly flexible so the sword won't break off with rough play.  I got this to go with the melissa and doug castle as a Christmas present.  I know my boys will love it!<br /><br />I wanted to update my review.  My son absolutely loves this and plays with it every day.  He's only 2.5 but it's his favorite out of the castle related things I got him for Christmas.  I plan on getting him more Schleich toys now.
B008LY9AWG|5.0|I just can't get enough of Michael Connelly.  His characters are like old friends, especially Harry Bosch.  His writing style is spare and straightforward, his character development unsurpassed among modern-day writers.
B0085MK2KI|5.0|I have loved the performances of Glenn Gould for over fifty years.  The production quality of these CD's is excellent and more than matches that of my worn out LP's.
B005LAIGRS|5.0|In my opinion this movies is full of action and suspense. It's certainly worth washing. Denzel Washington pulls it off again by playing his role well...

B000N2HBSO|5.0|This book is excellent.  It's written in a very accessible manner, but it successfully tells a very complicated story in an extremely coherent way.  This is how popular history should be written.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|its awesome! easy, fast, and well, amazing! it even simplifies! and unlike some annoying apps, it doesn't require unnessisary Internet connection!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My 12 yr old loves this game!  She doesn't want her sister playing on it!<br />No clue what you do on it but it sure keeps her occupied :)
B00340ESIS|5.0|Snyder classifies genres in a unique, but helpful way to better understand storytelling for the screen. Syd Field's &#34;Screenplay&#34; and Robert McKee's &#34;Story&#34; and &#34;Save The Cat&#34; are the 3 most important books on screenwriting.

B00000J6AG|5.0|It's timeless. One of the few CD's that I can listen to fully, for hours on end. It offers enough variety to keep me interested while doing routine tasks, so I can listen while working. The sounds just makes me feel good...especially 'Porcelain&#34;.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Such a great movie. I watched it elsewhere and loved it so much that I decided to purchase my own copy.  It is full of stars and an all around 'feel good movie'!
B0041KVYIW|2.0|Despite having read several accounts of how variable the new Beatles vinyl pressings were, I decided to give EMI the benefit of the doubt and purchase two titles on vinyl.  What a mistake that was!<br /><br />First the bad: this LP and Rubber Soul both suffer from a handful of issues. One of my favorite tracks on Revolver, \\"Eleanor Rigby,\\" first of all suffers from mishandling at the pressing plant, as it is scratched halfway through.  These are not lengthwise scratches, but look more like a \\"scribble\\" of sorts.  If I could post photos here, I would.  The vinyl itself is noisy, indicating either poor quality vinyl (what is this, the 70s?) or dirty plant conditions.  I have not tried it on the record vacuum yet.  One of the sides is slightly off-center.  And finally, it suffers from a couple of cases of \\"no fill,\\" where the vinyl did not fully fill the mold at the tops of the grooves (you can hear it as sort of a \\"sputtering\\" during playback).  At least it doesn't skip, like Rubber Soul does.<br /><br />Having bought enough recent 180 gram vinyl releases, rest assured that these are among the noisiest I've ever purchased. I've bought cleaner used vinyl than what I'm hearing here.<br /><br />The good: despite the poor vinyl quality, they've done a nice job on the packaging. As for the sonics, I'm no purist that spends hundreds of dollars on any original Parlophone pressing or endlessly frets over tiny details I couldn't care less about.  In that light, I find that these LPs have a very nice tonal balance--I do feel, as others do, that they sound a bit better than the recent CD remasters and \\"Apple USB  stick\\" version.<br /><br />Verdict: a wasted opportunity.  Great sonics on poor quality vinyl pressings.  I've been told by numerous others that the EU pressings are fantastic, so that is where I will be spending my money from now on.  EMI should know better...or are they so caught up in penny pinching that they used the lowest-regarded pressing facility in the U.S.(Rainbo)?nbo)?

081297381X|5.0|Before black swan was found in Australia, almost every European believed that swan was white. This was European's basic conception and was hard to change, because this was proved through prior experience. The phrase \\"black swan\\" was once a symbol of events those would never happen. However, this unshakable concept collapsed as the first black swan was found. The whole black swan issue appeals the fragility of our knowledge that is attained by observing and experience.<br /> The existence of black swan means that a extremely significant (good or bad) event might happen not matter how small the probability is. It is out of our limit of imagination but changes everything. People always over-trust their experience but do not realize that even just one \\"black swan\\" appears, everything can be overthrown. \\"911\\" and economic crisis in 2008 are rarely happened events. They are unpredictable and have a great impact.<br /> The \\"black swan\\" is not just a problem about randomness. It relates to how we consider the future: We always think we know adequate knowledge to anticipate the future. So far, we have unprecedented amount of knowledge but disasters are unprecedentedly frequent. Thus, we have to stop and think: Are we wrong?<br /> That is the author wants to tell us.
0525953728|5.0|The book is amazing and has a great mix of terrible sadness as well as great humor and keeps you wanting to read and never stop, it is like reading a  book your best friend wrote
B0041LG08U|2.0|Watch was in English and Arabic.  I couldn't get it to work.  Crown did not lock securely.  I returned the watch.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|Enjoyed the point and click story while searching for objects and solving puzzles.  I tend to favor the adventure hidden object genre instead but this was a refreshing change of pace.  I did find that no matter how many times I tried I could not access the map from chapter two.  It threw me out of the game completely.  However, when I reentered the game my progress was saved and I picked up exactly where I left off.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Good story line and keeps you wanting to keep going;suspenseful and flowing just like all of the Harry Bosch Series; very hard to put down.
B009B8YZIK|5.0|The acting, production, and plot were all way better than I expected.  This is actually one of the best sci-fi movies I have seen in the last few years.  The special effects were of the highest quality.  Would love to see a live action sequel to this, or any other Halo storyline.  I watched this for free, and am now going to buy it.  I want to give them props for making such a terrific film and showing it for free.
1419701533|5.0|My grandson is having trouble with his reading, but he LOVES &#34;Diary of a Whimpy Kid&#34; and has gone on and on how he reads them at school, but then has to leave them there. I saw the boxed set and immediately knew what he needed. Now he reads every day and night and is helping himself without even realizing because all he's doing is having fun. A grandmother couldn't ask for more. I am thrilled with the purchase and my grandson is SO happy. Thank you so much for packaging the books together. My only wish is that the whole series would have been in the set. I will be buying him numbers six and seven soon. Thank you again.

B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This is it. The biggie. The replacement i5 2500K. The new quad-core Intel Core i5 3570K, one of two new processors from Intel's new 22nm Ivy Bridge family of CPUs, has plenty to prove.<br />the standard this new chip will be measured by is the Intel Core i5 2500K from the Sandy Bridge generation, the best all round gaming CPU ever and all the chip most people need.<br />Or maybe that should be the Core i5 2550K which was a very minor clock speed bump over the 2500K. In truth, they're much of a muchness.<br />At first glance, you might wonder whether the Intel Core i5 3570K is actually a new chip, so similar are the headline specifications to its predecessor.<br />With four cores and no Hyper threading support, there's not a lot of extra CPU hardware. The clock speeds and cache haven't budged an inch, either. As before, we're talking 3.4GHz nominal, 3.8GHz Turbo and 6MB of cache.<br />Dig a little deeper and the differences emerge.<br />For gamers and performance enthusiasts, the most important upgrade is the shrink from 32nm to 22nm process technology and the introduction of Intel's 3D Tri-gate transistors.<br />The upshot is what Intel is calling a &#34;Tick-plus&#34;.<br />A &#34;Tick&#34; in Intel-speak means a die shrink of an existing processor architecture, where a &#34;Tock&#34; is a new design using the old manufacturing tech.<br />So, the existing Core i5 2550K is part of the Sandy Bridge Tock family and the new Intel Core i5 3570K is an Ivy Bridge Tick.<br /><br />that said, did you get it? :D<br /><br />The Core i5 3570K gets the full fat HD Graphics 4000 core, so that means 16 execution units where the old 2550K had just 12. Each unit gets an upgrade too, with more processing power and an upgrade from DX10 to DX11 suppport.<br />The final change of note is the addition of PCI Express 3.0.<br />As before, the main PCI Express controller is integrated into the Core i5 3570K's die and as before you get 16 lanes to play with regards discrete graphics cards.But with double the bandwidth of PCI Express 2.0, the Intel Core i5 3570K and other Ivy Bridge chips make a more robust platform for multi-GPU graphics.<br />not to forget to mention,<br />Where the 2550K is rated at 95W, the Core i5 3570K has a 77W TDP. That said, with the core count, clocks and 6MB cache carried over, one thing is clear. If the Intel Core i5 3570K is to deliver improved performance, those minor core revisions are going to have to do the work.<br /><br />again great product, and thank you amazon as always

B009A3NGF4|5.0|I had extremely high expectations for Mumford & Sons new album &#34;Babel&#34; after listening to their first release over and over.  So not too surprisingly I was a little disappointed at first.  But after a few plays through, it grew on me and, while I still believe &#34;Sigh No More&#34; is better album, &#34;Babel&#34; is still a great CD of its own right.  I'm not a professional reviewer, so I'll keep my review brief and just make a list of my favorite tracks (in no particular order).  They are mostly made up of the most up-tempo and catchy songs on the album.<br /><br />My favorite tracks on Babel:<br />-Babel<br />-I Will Wait<br />-Hopeless Wanderer<br />-Broken Crown<br />-The Boxer
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love it! its on going you don't have to buy coins if you don't want to. I love the shake button it saves my prizes and the only coin I would buy is the special coin wall one. you wont lose any coins for the time!
0231161166|3.0|Very well written book with lots of good information inside. After the first chapter or so however you essentially need to be a professor studying genetics in order to comprehend the subject matter. Very detailed and scientific. Still enjoyable!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Really don't know what to say without giving any spoilers. But I'll try as best to put a few thoughts down here.  Can not put my finger on it, but for some reason,did not find this as enjoyable as the first 2. Just too many twists and turns maybe. After 1 and 2 was looking for it all to be wrapped up in a less complicated way. Grew very tired of the twists and turns and the more and more on  and on. Actually thought about giving it 3 stars, but the final 2 chapters finally, finally wrapped things up.  Overall a fantastic trilogy. Am very interested in reading other reviews of this 3 rd book to see if someone else agrees with me or not. I could understand someone giving t<br />his a 3, but would not understand why anyone would give this a 5.

B004BLDD9Y|5.0|So far these bulbs are great. They take even less electricity than a CFL, which makes them quite \\"green\\" in my book. I've replaced all incandescent lights with CFL and am swapping in LED bulbs where I want to leave a light on most of the time. I put two of these in a ceiling fixture in my office where the ceilings are 10 foot high. The bulbs put out just the right amount of light. They're not overpowering and they don't get warm (unlike the first generation of LED lightbulbs I tried). I am going to get a couple more pair for lights that I will leave on all the time in the house (or on timers).<br /><br />Unlike some CFLs, these don't need time to warm up in a cooler room.<br /><br />Update 1/5/13 - just install four more into lights that I leave on 24/7.

B005LAIIPS|3.0|The Bourne Legacy starts and ends with a lot of action scenes, but there is a huge lull in the middle. For about 45 minutes to an hour the movie generates little action. During this lull the science of how Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz)is able to solve Aaron Cross's (Jeremy Renner)problems with his \\"super soldier\\" medication is flimsy at best. Also you need to see all three of the previous Bourne movies to have any idea what is going on. The Bourne Legacy cannot stand on it's own.<br /><br />The Bourne Trilogy set the bar very high for any Bourne related movie. The Bourne Legacy lacks substance for a little less than half the movie. Unless you are a die hard spy movie fan I would avoid this one.
B006O6F932|5.0|This monster high house is great its for my granddaughter for xmas can't wait for her to open it, she will have hours playing with it.

B005LAII1C|5.0|I love Ted. I saw it several times in theaters and just had to have it when it came out. Seth MacFarlane is a multi-talented comic genius. His work with Ted, the voice acting, the work in the motion capture suit and his attention to detail in the animations made for a character that seemed completely real,some much so that you really think of Ted less as a bear, and more as a person.<br />I am also a huge fan of Family Guy and Seth's other voice over and writing work so it came to no surprise that I'd love this movie. You need a sense of humor for this movie. If you are easily offended and don't like adult humor, you're missing out, but I suggest you not watch this movie.<br />Most the negative reviews that I've seen are from people that don't like adult humor and are easily offended, or are parents that were dumb enough to take their children to this movie, or were the cynical guys that love to bash family guy and Seth because they can't really enjoy anything, love to complain and think their opinions matter. These people should be ignored because it is hard to enjoy a good movie if you are a prude, dumb enough to show this movie to your kids or are a cynical troll.<br />I CAN GIVE YOU LOVE, AND ROCKING HORSES....AND DANCING!!!
B008602KQI|5.0|This was a very good movie. It kept my interest from beginning to end. I highly recommend it. Good movie for the kids to watch too.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|The first story in this collection is excellent - as good as anything by Robert Heinlein or Arthur C. Clarke. I would give that story alone 6 stars if I could. It found a home in my imagination and has stayed with me ever since. However, stories 2-5 are not as well developed or written and are less memorable. They're not awful, but definitely can't compare with the first. Because those four stories compose the bulk of this &#34;Omnibus,&#34; I gave the whole package only 4 stars. But do buy this or the stand-alone first story (which I see is available for FREE on Kindle) - it is a keeper. And I do plan on checking out some of Hugh Howey's other stories.
0345803485|2.0|I read \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" to figure out why this work of fan fiction inspired by Stephenie Meyer's \\"Twilight\\" series had become such an overnight sensation. After all, thousands, if not millions of fans have written pieces inspired by their favorite stories. Why did E.L. James' trilogy that kicks off with this book become so popular that it's sold millions of copies and soon will be made into a major motion picture?<br /><br />I have to conclude that it's not because of the writing. As many reviewers, professional and personal, have pointed out, it's not because James produced a literary classic. Au contraire, most who give the books high marks are apologists that sidestep the issue of her writing - the obvious similarities to \\"Twilight\\" characters, hackneyed clich&eacute;s invoked ad nauseum, Britishisms in Seattle, even typos (I found two). By the end of the book, one more bite of Ana's lip or Victorian gasp could turn any reader into Christian Grey with a riding crop ready to teach some grammar lessons.<br /><br />So if it's not the writing, why are readers buying millions of copies of this mediocre book? I have a few theories. One, \\"Fifty Shades\\" have become a proxy for the fifth book in the \\"Twilight\\" series that Meyers may never write until she's enticed by a publisher to write a sequel to \\"Breaking Dawn.\\" Until then, fans can channel their post-Bella and Edward letdown into Ana and Christian mania and turn \\"Team Edward\\" and \\"Team Jacob\\" into \\"Team Ana\\" and \\"Team Christian.\\"<br /><br />Two, \\"Fifty Shades\\" ups the ante with a subject, Bondage/Domination/Sadomasochism (BDSM), that surpasses paranormal romance in its scintillating attraction as a forbidden fruit one secretly enjoys as a guilty indulgence. What was once aplomb with buzz, paranormal romance, is now the new normal, and James has pushed the boundaries of the mainstream by taking extreme romance to a whole new level. It's easy to imagine that the post-\\"Fifty Shades\\" world lies in the hand of a Christian Grey fan who, as I type, is writing the next book sensation continuing the saga of Bella and Edward, Ana and Christian in a sort of rebirth that would make the Wachowski siblings of \\"Cloud Atlas\\" twinge with jealousy. Perhaps an alien romance taking humans to farther extremes awaits us in the near future after this series runs its course.<br /><br />The brouhaha around \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" is certainly not because of the writing. I give it two stars and a caution to anyone who doesn't read paranormal or BDSM romance but wants to check out what all the hype is about. Just leave it be.Grey fan who, as I type, is writing the next book sensation continuing the saga of Bella and Edward, Ana and Christian in a sort of rebirth that would make the Wachowski siblings of \\"Cloud Atlas\\" twinge with jealousy.

B0068FYZH0|5.0|I was never interested in watching this movie until it was an assignment for my psychology class. The movie is a masterpiece! The cast was well-chosen, the acting was superb and the plot was entertaining. The transfer to Blu-Ray is good but could have been better. Expect it to be slow in some spots but the plot twists and ending will leave you speechless. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for a classic.

B00479SVBU|5.0|My cd player conked out and it was $350 to fix it. So I got this player, loaded some MP3 files on a 16GB USB drive, plugged it in, tuned my car radio to the station number on the MP3 player and, voila, great sound, easy to use, navigate and enjoy. I'll never get my cd player fixed, just a thing of the past. Thanks for a great product that works exactly as advertised.<br /><br />Now I've tried various sd cards without much success. Not sure of the problem but all of the USB drives work great so I'll stick to them.<br /><br />I also plugged the unit into my auxiliary plug in the car, sounds great and even easier to use, just tune the radio to Aux.
B005LAIHZY|2.0|As an adult, I realize this movie is targeted at me directly, my daughter enjoys watching Brave. This is the worst of the Pixar movies in my opinion. Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc and others are very enjoyable, this one has a really bad plot, and no characters you fall in love with. I would rather watch Finding Nemo for the 25th time than watch this for the second time.

B00005JL96|5.0|Very original story. My favorite movie for the kids. It's about two sisters who are trying to cope with the death of the parents and the older sister tries her very best to look after as well as be the head of the family for her little sister, so that she doesn't end up in foster care. But when the alien(Sticth) comes to earth, he makes things even more difficult, because he's trying to blend in with earth species as a dog, so that he doesn't get captured by the authorities from his planet. Also I love how the characters drawn in the movie are not as models. They are very beautiful and athletic. Hawaii has a beautiful culture.<br />Cute family movie for the vault to stay. I strongly recommend for family night.

030759565X|3.0|Most of the recipes in this are pretty simple and easy to make for weeknight cooking.  Easy to find ingredients, simple ways of cooking.  It provides a nice way to mix things up a little if you aren't used to experimenting much in the kitchen.<br /><br />I was pretty disappointed in the lack of a soup section and the desserts/sweets take up a huge amount in the book!  Sometimes her cooking times are wonky: in her black bean ragout, she said it could take 3-6 hours in a slow cooker!!!  Hard to plan a meal around that.  (I ended up turning it into soup!)  This sounds more and more like a bad review, but I actually like it and bought it more in support of her blog.  Great gift for the amateur/timid cook.  Good mix of meaty and vegetarian items.  Not intimidating.  Sometimes she spends too much time blabbing about her life instead of just presenting recipes, but I guess that is what is hip now when you have a blog and turn it into a cookbook; every recipe has to have a long story attached.
034580404X|5.0|I was glad I bought the trilogy and it is hard to stop at the end of book one.  I have everyone borrowing this from me to read.  My friends Grandma borrowed it from me as they were reading it in their book club.  This is not a literary masterpiece but a fun easy read.
B000YDCFRE|5.0|Great boots.  They are super comfortable and super light (they are lighter than some of my other leather shoes).  I found that I can wear them all day with minimal fatigue.  WARNING - they do run a full size large.  I wear 10.5 in Nike athletic shoes.  I ordered a 9.5 and they are still a bit big (but work fine with big socks).  Overall, and A+

And YES, it does get you into some of the 'hidden' apps and functions that are otherwise out of reach.  Feels more like Windows explorer!

1600242197|4.0|I found this book to be informative, captivating, and an incredible story of survival against all odds.  Much insight is provided regarding the Afghan people and their culture but the focus is clerly on the role of special forces in the war and the extreme challenges encountered by the fighting man.  The language used in the book is very strong (ample profanity) but it's not done out of context.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|It's free and it's fun. 4 stars for the annoying scroll of advertisements at the top of the screen. That's the &#34;price&#34; you pay for something free, I guess.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm not a fan of typical zombie movies but this series has sucked me in. The plot and character development is first rate, some of the best writing I've seen in a while.  I find myself totally engrossed with the characters and cheering their success and mourning their losses.

B00009N828|4.0|I own this movie because I am a fan of the director and own many of his films.  This movie is a great movie with a great acting job done by the two main actors in the movie Leo and Lewis.  The movie itself is rather long almost 3 hours long, I have heard that the orginal cut would have been almost 4 hours long but some scenes had to be chopped down for the theathre release.  It did feel like it drag in a few scenes as fair warning but it is still a movie well worth watching at least once in your lifetime.  I have seen it three times so far in my lifetime.  I have yet to grow tired of it, because both characters stood up for what they believed in Lewis standing tall for America, while Leo stood up for his Irish history and his people.  Bonus note I enjoyed the end scene of the movie showing how New York aged from 1800's all the way to what it is today.  And like the director says on front cover of the DVD \\"America was born in the streets.\\"
0307959856|1.0|I felt the treatment of Lizzie and Darcy were not in keeping with the Jane Austen characters. The murder victim and the murderer were disappointments. I loved the Patrice Sarath characterizations she was more in keeping with how I envisioned Jane Austen's characters after Pride and Prejudice. This is the only PD JAMES book I've read may try others, but this one is not in my &#34;Good Opinion&#34; worth the time.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Well written, keeping the reader in suspense with  unforeseen twists that flow logically and smoothly. Very enjoyable reading. I highly recommend this book.
145210655X|5.0|Love this book! It's a Chrimstas gift for my dad and I know he'll love it. It's a much longer story than I thought it was going to be and it's hard cover so it'll stay in great condition much longer.

B009H442DG|5.0|I love it. It is upbeat and happy with a little swing. Love it. When you hear them talk and use the nicknames for each other it sounds like two true friends coming together and makes you reminise on your own past and friends.

B009B8YZKS|5.0|Was on the edged of my seat for this and 343 did not disappoint. Well I do have a few minor complaints but I feel there not worth mentioning. So here is my final verdict of this. First this is probably the closest where going to get to a Halo Movie. (Please correct me if I am wrong for the love of god! Someone Please tell me I'm wrong.)<br /><br />Next I enjoy this from episode one to episode five and that last one made me go, \\"OMG OMG OMG OMG DID HE OMG OMG OMG\\" So yeah sound track please next 343 studios. Worth it all 90 minutes.
B007FRHZ4A|3.0|The title pretty much says it all. The idea of the game is that you build a structure shown on the cards, set the pigs on it and then knock it down with your catapult. All well and good except that the plastic blocks are so light that stacking them is really a pain in the neck. They need a bit more weight to them in order to stay put.<br /><br />My kids ended up playing with this game for an hour trying to build the different towers from the game cards. Finally they gave up, put away all the blocks and ended up playing with the pigs and the birds!<br /><br />So, not a total waste but certainly not as promising as it looks on the box.
B007SGM084|5.0|Im not much of a reader but this book was suggested to me by a friend,,I had doubts at first but now I can't wait to open my kindle on my breaks...
B00338QENI|4.0|Well-written, highly informative and entertaining account of an aspect of medicine and science I never would have thought of. Am I still the &#34;owner&#34; of my blood or cell when it is disconnected from my living body?&#34; I'm still wrestling with that one! My only complaint is that the book seems padded to increase its length -- a lot of redundant information in the final chapters and appendices that seem to be included only to match an editor's notion of how long a book at this price point should be. Despite that, highly recommend.
0979019710|5.0|The Miracle Morning is not like most self-help books/audios where the impact last so long and fades away.  The Miracle Morning is a powerful tool that has the ability to change someone's life permanently.  What is taught in this book is so impacting, I wish I knew these secrets a long time ago!  I highly recommend everyone read this book and share it.  It's an easy read and the material is easy to utilize right away.  The Miracle Morning could be the thing you need to help you become a better you every day!

B00846REIS|4.0|The crossfire books are good.  They are entertaining.  I never got bored with any of the books.  The love scenes are rather steamy.  The characters are a little unrealistic.  All of the characters are beautiful and rich which is a little unrealistic, however it has a great storyline.  I enjoyed it.
B008602KQI|4.0|Excellent movie my only complaint is with the money I spent to buy it, I should be able to dl it to my computer since I brought it as a permanent copy.

B005LAIIHG|4.0|Ang Lee is a director drawn to projects because of their narrative and their potential beauty. I can't think of a film he has made that was dull to look at or uninteresting. Even \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is beautiful to watch, something that could potentially detract from the overall narrative. But in Lee's hands, he brings both together in harmonious symphony. Now, with his latest film, an adaptation of the popular bestseller \\"The Life of Pi\\", he adds 3-D to the mix.<br /><br />I know it seems like every other film is released in 3-D now. After the success of \\"Avatar\\", studios are anxious to collect the extra $3 per ticket so even films that were not shot in 3-D are being retrofitted and released (or re-released) in 3-D.  I have yet to see one of these `retrofitted' films that truly use the magic of 3-D to enhance the viewing experience. Because they don't work, these unsuccessful films seem like a desperate money grab and only serve to leave a bad taste in the mouth.<br /><br />And because they are so eager for that extra $3, they make a lot of films in 3-D. For a while, every one of these films was deemed a huge success, but now the novelty has worn off and there have been a few 3-D flops, leading some chains to devote one theater per location to both 2-D and 3-D presentations of the same film, alternating the formats. Not a good development. There are still major blockbusters, the tentpoles the studios want and need to earn a billion dollars to prop up the rest of their releases. So every superhero film, pretty much all animation, most action and horror films, even a few comedies and dramas reach 3-D screens. Comedies and dramas? Why, so we can see the requisite scene of a character vomiting in 3-D? It isn't necessary for a lot of these films to be in 3-D. It simply doesn't add anything to the experience.<br /><br />Of course, there have been exceptions. \\"Life of Pi\\" is such an exception. Lee uses 3-D to add another visual layer, another texture to this almost fable-like film. He integrates the technique into the fabric of the story, making it a character. It is a pretty remarkable achievement.<br /><br />He also uses 3-D as an effective technique when composing the shots. As Pi relates the story of his uncle, a well-known swimmer, we watch as he enters a pristine public pool in France. A woman wearing a stylish sun hat sits in the foreground before Lee pulls the camera back to reveal the amazingly beautiful pool. Because of the time period, the storytelling nature and the art deco look of the public facility, we instantly become transported into the story.<br /><br />Early in the film, the adult Pi is telling his story to a writer (presumably Yann Martel, the writer of the book) and the scene dissolves to a shot of Pi's uncle swimming through a pool. The actor playing the adult Pi remains in the frame as the other character swims across the field of vision before we dissolve to the shot of the swimmer. I'm probably not doing this scene justice with my description, but the way Lee composes the shots, and uses 3-D to transition between them, really enhances the viewing experience and helps to build the tall-tale nature of the story.<br /><br />My only disappointment with the film is that Lee and his screenwriter David Magee (\\"Finding Neverland\\", \\"Miss Pettigrew Lives For a Day\\") didn't take a little more license with the book. Generally, I find just the opposite in a book-to-film adaptation. Lee clearly respects Martel's original book (he has a reputation as a Writer's Director, adapting their work very methodically and carefully) and slavishly tries to adapt the entire tale to the screen for us to watch. Unfortunately, because Lee is so intent on delivering the whole book, he mars his overall film just slightly. In the book, Pi tells his story to a writer, beginning the narrative and popping back into the story whenever the writer needs some clarification. Lee has two actors playing Pi and the writer (Irfan Khan and Rafe Spall, respectively). The film opens in Pi's apartment in Montreal as he is preparing a vegetarian lunch for his guest. He starts telling his story and we watch as he cuts vegetables and prepares the meal. Later, when we revisit them, they have gone on a walk and spend some time in a park, watching the river, as Pi continues the story. Later, they return to his apartment as Pi finishes the story. We spend far too much time watching two people talk before the visual fades to images of what they are talking about. It just isn't necessary to see soooo much of this. These moments serve to draw us out of the narrative and visual, both of which Lee has done such a splendid job of creating. Why would we want to spend any time sitting in a non-descript apartment in Montreal watching two men discuss what we could be living through with the characters? In a book, this type of narrative device works better; as one of the characters is telling their story, you begin to imagine the visuals they are describing. It is also a much more seamless experience. But when you are watching a film, you want to see these descriptions played out. It is a little dull watching these two men sitting and talking, for so much of the film. When Lee tells the story in images, it is a truly memorable experience. When he spends so much time with the actors telling a story, it is less interesting.<br /><br />The visual part of the story is simply mesmerizing.  Once Pi and his family board the freighter with all of their animals, you know what will happen. Pi will eventually end up on a lifeboat with a tiger the family has named Richard Parker. While the story may be simplistic, Lee uses the visual quality of the setting to bring an almost ethereal quality to the film.<br /><br />As the two survivors battle each other, the elements and some truly spectacular unexpected elements, a story evolves and draws you into this unique universe.<br /><br />In the hands of a less accomplished director, spending a significant amount of film time with two characters, only one of which speaks English, could be problematic. First of all, the one actor has a lot of time on his hands, and the focus is on him. Just the slightest misstep and his portrayal falls apart. It is difficult to hold the attention of the audience for that long, but Suraj Sharma, who plays Pi, does a really good job. He deals with his situation in a natural way, never giving up hope, always pushing forward, trying to survive. Of course, this also seems natural because of all of the history we have already witnessed for his character (for instance, Pi's intense interest in religion), but he does a very good job of making the character seem natural and real. Too often when an actor has too much time on their own, they start to act overly theatrical, as though they are on stage giving a soliloquy. This isn't a far stretch; stage monologues are very similar and most actors have probably performed at least a few. But a monologue in a film is more problematic and the equivalent of two characters talking about an event, rather than showing it. In \\"Pi\\", it is necessary to see these moments, because they give us insight into the character. And Sharma steers clear of histrionics, unless they are necessary to show us his frustration.<br /><br />The CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) in \\"Pi\\" is a pretty remarkable achievement. On the one hand, CGI is used to create some of the animals and some of their interactions. The best compliment I can give is that it is difficult to tell when real animals are used and when the CGI takes over. Real animals were used at some point (a Tiger trainer is listed in the credits), but it is difficult to tell when the CGI begins. Richard Parker shares the most interactions with Pi and he becomes a character in the film; a huge, fearsome beast with feelings, needs and goals. You almost get to the point that you begin to understand what his roars mean.<br /><br />The CGI is also used to create some of the most beautiful tableaus you may have ever seen in a film. At one point, Pi and the tiger are sitting in the lifeboat in a completely lifeless sea; their reflection cast on the still water makes it look like we are looking in a mirror. The sky is filled with orange, yellow, red, all of which are also reflected. Of course, the water is not always so serene and the CGI helps to bring the fearsome storms and strange sea creatures to life in an almost brilliant way.<br /><br />Because most of the film is inhabited by two characters, in a limited space, the 3-D helps this space become more interesting and also gives us a better feeling of what this space is like, allowing us to get a feeling of what Pi and Richard Parker are going through. It also enhances the visual beauty of the film, making us feel as though we are in a second lifeboat watching the two interact.<br /><br />Lee has fashioned a beautiful, fable-like film advancing the use of two technologies to bring an otherwise unfilmable story to life.icant amount of film time with two characters, only one of which speaks English, could be problematic.

B006UG90RM|4.0|Six or eight years ago I read an interview with David Lee Roth in which he said a reunion with Van Halen was inevitable, &#34;because that's show biz.&#34;  This was despite -- at the time -- Eddie needing an &#34;intervention&#34; and Roth being so p.o.'d at Alex he wouldn't even say &#34;the drummer's&#34; name.  Well, what do you know, it happened!  To me the first-most-apparent difference from the Van Halen of old is in the vocals; Roth's voice doesn't go from zero to sixty like it used to when he was a young firecracker, and Michael Anthony's backing vocals aren't there.  There isn't any track on the album that grabbed me as an instantly-memorable, slap-it-on-repeat song -- there's no &#34;1984&#34;, &#34;Jump&#34;, or &#34;Panama&#34; on this release -- but overall, it's better than I expected, and kinda fun.

Anyone living through the Vietnam era, the peace, love, smoking weed era is going to absolutely relate to this movie and have a great time laughing at all of the witty, commentary.  I didn't know what to expect, but I love Mark Walberg and I love stuffed animals, so I thought, what the heck.  I got so much enjoyment from this movie, I can't even describe it.  Let's face it too, has Mark Walberg EVER done anything bad???  NO, he hasn't.  Trust me, see the movie TED!

0062060554|5.0|Suspenseful! Every bit of information they give you is important! If they included it they did for a reason - it's possible for you to figure out the ending on your own... but you might not realize it until you're already there. Great writing style.<br />The character is meant to be in her... 40's if I remember correctly, but the story is ageless, you can understand and relate to the story regardless.<br />Excellent writing, keeps you turning pages.

0307341577|4.0|Do not read this book at night, you will not sleep... it can be a bit graphic with descriptions. If you're squeamish, I wouldn't suggest reading the end when they put it all together. Gillian Flynn did a great job in giving a character perspective that I've never read before (a much darker perspective) and I've read a lot of books. It took a little while to get used to her writing style, the character is very angry, and descriptions are (for lack of a better word) dark!<br />But it was so good. It keeps you reading, I was done in a couple days. Flynn gives you enough information to keep you guessing, and trying to figure out the mystery of the deaths as you go. She don't trick you, just gives you the information in ways that you don't realize until it all comes together.

B005LAIHY0|5.0|One of the few movies my wife actually raved about, we both thought Prometheus was an excellent movie.  The only 2 things I can say bad about the BD is it took almost 2 minutes for the disc to load on a fast loading machine, and the previews were FAR TOO MANY with no way to get past them but to FF.  But neither of those faults detract from our overall enjoyment of this movie.  Original, captivating, suspenseful, great sci-fi adventure.  We had a good time with this movie.  Great escapism.  -kd5-

1452110581|2.0|I bought this book as a gift based on the great reviews. I was not impressed when I read it, actually I think i laughed three times while reading it, not nearly as amusing as I was expecting after reading all the positive reviews..
B009VB97EY|5.0|actually saw it at the movie theater and had to purchase! will watch over and over. channing has an amazing body....matthew has always been my favorite....
B005IQZB14|5.0|The book arrived quickly, in perfect condition and is a truly great read!  This was a perfect transaction in every way.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Overall I liked the firm but as in a lot of Hollywood films some of the scenes are just too long and I also do not like some of the levels of violence.  I do not see the need to show the details of violence when there are ways to imply it without all the gruesome details.
B0053YGYO4|3.0|This is not my favorite Coldplay album. It's a bit dull compared to some of the other albums they've produced. I'll listen to it, but it won't be played as often as their previous albums.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Well written. Not overly technical. Didn't want to put it down. Do yourself a favor, buy it from Amazon and READ it! You'll thank me.
B0053O89KG|5.0|I love the Series and was not able to watch  it all. This way I can watch them at my convenience and not be interupted  when they are on.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was so hooked on this book! I couldn't put it down at all...  I can't wait to start the second book!!!
B009E3EY38|5.0|just the greatest band in the world just wish i was there  hope they tour again around here  love it
B008N1V11U|1.0|you guys had to put it back to 6.99$ rip off I liked it better when it was 1.00$ la's week
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I bought this Blu Ray disc in the dark.<br />I had read few reviews and didnt know much about the story. I trusted Disney would not disappoint me.<br />And, of course, it didnt! It was one of the best productions I've seen. The deepness of the story, the voices of the cast, the quality of each detail...<br />Amazing!!!
B008G59IBI|5.0|Green Day's \\"¡Tre'!\\" reviewed<br /><br />For those of you who have been following my posts, you know that I am a fan of Green Day and have reviewed their last two albums from their current musical trilogy. Since the third installment was just released, I shall keep in motion and offer my thoughts.<br /><br />The third release \\"¡Tre'!\\" is musically the most energetic and fun out of all three releases. I enjoyed both releases but this is the icing on the cake. There is not a bad track or filler track on this effort. The lyrics are thought provoking, clever and relevant to today's generation, yesterday's and tomorrow's. There are some beautiful energetic melodies that are catchy and would definitely make an arena crowd rock out.<br /><br />The band along with Rob Cavallo have produced a musical effort thst stands along with the Rolling Stones' \\"Sticky Fingers\\" and AC/DC's \\"For Those About to Rock, We Salute You\\" Albums. This recording will stand the test of time and will become a staple in any Green Day Collection. The album grows on you instantly. Think of this as a freight train. The album starts off with a beautiful guitar solo with some absorbing vocals by Billy Joe Armstrong on \\"Brutal Love\\" but this is only momentary as the composition soon picks up force and speed. All throughout the next ten songs, the fuel keeps pumping and sends that train along the tracks visiting various subjects such as personal relationships, self observation and life. The train ride finally comes to it's destination with the final track which is a power ballad called \\"The Forgotten.\\"<br /><br />As mentioned, every track is a gem but some of my favorites that stand out are \\"Drama Queen\\", \\"Sex, Drugs and Violence\\", \\"Amanda\\", \\"Missing You\\", \\"A Little Boy Named Train\\", \\"Amanda\\", \\"Walk Away\\", \\"8th Avenue Serenade\\", \\"99 Revolutions\\" and \\"The Forgotten.\\"<br /><br />Whether a long time fan or new fan, this is a fun album. I highly suggest giving this a listen...<br /><br />Commentary most welcomed.-Tony Medina
B002ZG97EC|5.0|For all ages... a day of pure fun! Top notch!<br />Got to love Grew and, of course, the minions!<br />Fantastic!!!
B000Q79HS8|5.0|I loved this movie. I have seen it 4 times now. I enjoy it every time. I wish there were more it this series.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|So I bought it after hearing about it on &#34;The Daily Show&#34; and figured I must have missed an important book. I was really intrigued at the psychoanalysis of a guy that is intellectually disabled (used to be called mentally retarded) and how, through science experiments, was able to attain a higher level of cognitive abilities. His emotional progression is the most compelling aspect of the book. The author had such great insight into the thought processes of someone with an intellectual disability. It was so touching to hear his inner thoughts and his reflections on how it was to have an intellectual disability.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|I enjoyed this and the next one in this series. Very well done and enjoyable. I would watch it again.
B00164KWUW|5.0|Much more appropriate plot resolution.  I suspect it was the ending originally written because the first ending did not explain the trapping by the devolved creature necessary to snag Col. Neville.  I also suspect that this ending is said to be \\"controversial\\" because it reveals truth about the nature of white people( a creature's nature is not sickness.) and because the black hero  did not sacrifice himself for white folks.  .At the same time the very end has him setting off in a quasi-romantic nature with a white woman at the end which I did NOT like and was a bunch of confusion..
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This is the first time I have seen this movie. I thought it very good and enjoyed it very much
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Very funny.  Great one liners throughout.  Wahlberg did a great job considering he's not know for his comedic acting.  Would watch again.
1611748755|5.0|Book started out slow, very spiritual.  As soon as Pi lands in the lifeboat with the zebra, hyena and tiger, the pace picks up dramatically and off it goes.  The reader was very engaging.
B0070R8WY2|5.0|I'd been noticing this album in my &#34;suggested&#34; list from Amazon Cloud Player for a while, but only decided to listen to Sharon's music on YouTube recently... and I'm glad I did!<br /><br />If you're wondering, try &#34;Serpents&#34; and &#34;All I Can&#34;. (this track has an awesome buildup till the very end). Those tracks should give you a good idea what her music's is like.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is fun to play and you do not have to look for thans to buld. piz play this it is so so mass fun
B0097NGUJG|5.0|If you buy one album this year, this should be it.<br /><br />It's so good, I often listen to the entire album on repeat (not skipping any tracks), which is rare for me.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and when you're listening to it, actually listen to it. Once you get hooked, you'll be addicted to it.<br /><br />If you _have_ to &#34;sample&#34; a few tracks, listen to &#34;Bloodflood&#34;, &#34;Fitzpleasure&#34; and &#34;Taro&#34;.
B007N9FKCY|5.0|This is a great game. Reminiscent of the old Nintendo or Sega side scrolling games. The graphics are great, as is the menu system and exit button.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|i love disney movies, I saw the entire line-up of Tinker-bell this one was great my nieces hate me for seeing it first
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I use it on my iPhone, iMac, and Kindle Fire HD. Depending on where the note gets entered, I get messages that the note/webclip aren't supported. It'd be nice if it just worked across platform.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is excellent and very helpful. Liked the battery calibration, but was very slow processing.  It quite possibly has extended the length of time the charge lasts.  Tablet's charge life exceeds by three hours what the literature states.
B0018OIK0E|5.0|Simon Pegg and the entire British cast are outstanding.  If you can't watch this movie over and over and laugh every time, you are a zombie!
B005HSG3VK|1.0|It is cheap and not at all what I thought I was getting. Would never order again - just not what I was expecting.
B007P6VM4A|4.0|I am a HUGE Hives fan but this one couldn't compare to their previous releases.  I hope they don't give up.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|works good does what I need it to works good on kindle fire no idea what else to say blah blah blah
B0050PYNP8|5.0|Must have to go along with Shaun of the Dead and other Simon Pegg movies.  Seth Rogan is outstanding as the voice of Paul.
1616960922|5.0|I don't know how Sanderson does it, but he has managed to incorporate a whole new concept in such a short book and still make it complete. The whole idea of the stamps and Forgery was so in depth and well explained, it never felt like an info-dump nor was I ever lost during the book. In short, I have fallen in love with Sanderson's writing :)
B000HKW7E0|5.0|10,000 stars is not enough.<br /> It is the best holiday movie. Ever, really. It is. (I have to write this or they will not let me submit it.)
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Movies are for entrainment and this movie does just that. It pokes fun at all the different actors in movie, and show  that they don't take themselves too seriously. It is a great movie if you want to laugh at really dumb puns.
0439023521|5.0|The story drew me in from the beginning and I feel the author does a wonderful job with detail to make the reader feel like theyre  in story.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|A strong story with an original premise. Not as good as his typical work, but still a great  and quick read.
0425263916|5.0|After reading Bared to you I wasn't sure if I was going to finish the series but this was book two so I decided to just read it to see where the story goes. I enjoyed this book much more than Bared to You and am actually looking forward to book 3.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Most amazing story ever. Every child / adult should see this movie. I love all the classics and this one has been added to my collection.
1476712042|5.0|I bought this book randomly and was surprised at how much I loved it! I wish it had a part 2
B009VSW15Y|2.0|a camera that takes pictures while you hold it.  A bit self indulgent I think.  I want to take pictures of friends and families.
0439023513|4.0|I really loved this series but this last book sort of lost some of the fire that was in the first two. The second book ends with so much intensity but this book does not pick up with the same feeling. Also, Peeta is my favorite part of the series and hes not present most of the story so that was my main problem. Overall, the author does not disappoint. This book put me on an emotional roller coaster and I stayed up a lot thinking about it.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The folks at marvel and the production company have hit another home run for the Marvel universe. The characters, now mostly familiar to the audience shine in their roles. The story line is what one would expect, and the action does not leave you lacking at all. The addition of Hawkeye is very good to the team, the set-up of the next installments has a growing and burgeoning Marvel Movie empire coming to full bloom. Bravo for another hit. It feels like being a kid again, only the imagination is aided with live action...
0439023491|5.0|I really loved this series! Book 2 was actually my favorite out of the 3. I recommend to anyone who like adventure and romance!
B007K3JCAE|5.0|This is a great sequel to the first movie a couple of years ago. Robert Downey and Jude Law are excellent together. The stories are great, the action done extremely well, and the sequences where the action is thought out in Holmes head is superb. I hope they do more of these as they are truly entertaining and fun to watch.
0425263908|4.0|I bought this book because everyone was comparing it to fifty shades of grey but to me it was different.Overall, it kept my interest and I read it pretty quickly but I wasnt drawn to it as much as I was to 50 shades. I read book two and it was much better so Im actually excited for book 3.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|Very Good Movie.<br /><br />Replacement purchase—after player 'ate' the last one.<br /><br />CGI is very well done. Continue to watch the credits, it's worth it.<br /><br />Good SciFi and action. (I think ther's a plot in there somewhere, I didn't notice or care.)<br /><br />Definite recommendation. I'll buy more (after Xmas madness), just in case another dvd gets eaten.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love the Piano Guys! The music is great and the fusion of classical and current is tremendous fun to listen to.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I bought the box set after I saw the first season; I could not wait to know where the story went from there. I love all characters, but my favorites are Tyrion, Jon, Arya and Danny....I hope that somehow Jon and Danny get together.<br />Gordana

034580404X|5.0|What I disliked was that I finished the series.<br />I would recomend it to friends, sisters, daughters<br />I cannot not say that I can farely compare this to anything I have ever read.<br />I enjoyed the fact that I was totally in my own world in this book
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Our family absolutely LOVES the Piano Guys!!!<br />Thank you for a great album! The music is so<br />creative and beautiful.  They make you want<br />to play the piano or the cello!
B000GCFY0I|5.0|I thought the book was very very good and entertaining. Kept me wanting to read more to fond out what was going to happen.

B0080K3G4O|4.0|When confronted with one of life's challenges, whether in his family or his business, my uncle David used to say, &#34;So what's the worst that can happen?&#34;  Turns out, that's one of the very effective coping strategies for people who can't stand positive thinking. If Wayne Dyer ever made you cringe, this book's for you.

B0087HT36U|5.0|Very addictive game. I love it!  Needs to be more levels. The levels available are very fun to play. Some are too challenging so I had to buy the buster bombs to solve them.
B005ZMTXMY|5.0|Up is a must have for any Pixar and Disney lover. It breaks your heart in the first ten minutes and then puts the pieces together through the rest of the film. A great film for the whole house, this entertains all ages!
B0015AARJI|1.0|Since this is a gift I have no idea how to rate the item.  Delivery and condition were good but I can't make a judgment.
B007IYWY3C|5.0|Effortless, seemingly; her voice soars. The is certainly some Kate Bush and a whisper of Bjork in her music but Florence is brilliant and is destined to be one of The Greats. Bravo!
B009MF5BXK|2.0|The draw to this film is the cast...all the greats of action flicks.  However, Bruce Willis is but a few brief minutes in the story, and then disappears. Jason Stratham is his usual best in any film he participates in.  Dolph Lundgren is genuinely repulsive, both in character and non-acting ability.  The biggest downer is to see Sly Stallone....at all.  He was engaging in his early  action films....ASSASINS, GET CARTER, the ROCKY franchise,and he somehow survived such material as the \\"clifff\\" movie with John Lithgow who stole the show, as he is wont to do.<br />Here, in the EXPENDABLES IS TRULY IS THAT...EXPENDABLE...!!!  His body hardly looks made for heaving around as he wants us to believe he can(not)...His mumbling has become disconcerting.  His facial expressions are missing.  It was a bitter disappointment
0307346617|5.0|because I was read in thai version before and they are translated very bad that why I choose to buy in English version
B009MF5BXK|5.0|excellent action movie with the best actors furnishing plenty of excitement. The story line is terrific, and the characters play their roles expertly!
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|I LOVE this book. The writing is absolutely exceptional and - sorry if I sound nerdy - it's teaching me a lot of new words! It's told from Kevin's mother's point of view, and her perfect descriptions and witty humor make reading this book awesome. It is literally so good, I would recommend it to anyone. If you want to read this book, have heard about it, are thinking about reading it, or even kind of maybe think it sounds interesting, you definitely should read it. If you know someone named Kevin, or better yet, even if you DON'T know someone named Kevin, you should STILL read the book because you will like it!! Just read the book! Kevin wants you to! Read it!!!

B00008G7UJ|4.0|I have always been torn between liking and disliking this movie. At times I think it's a great concept, but other times I can't overlook the imperfections and stereotypes created by Baz Luhrman. Any way one looks at it, the movie is certainly worth considering. If you're patient, what here I've missed, my explanation shall strive to mend<br /><br />To begin with, the story of Romeo and Juliet is not the genesis of William Shakespeare, rather it is a story sprung from antiquity. The tale of star-crossed lovers potentially goes back as far as oral tradition, but one can put a name to the first consideration. Ovid's story of struggling lovers laid the framework for William Shakespeare to take over centuries later. As the story was told more often, more characters came to light - thus the play is a living being capable of taking on numerous changes. In fact, Romeo and Juliet did not stop after Shakespeare made it famous. Playwrights continued to use the basic storyline in many plays, including one about two quarreling senators instead of lovers. The most famous remake would be Westside Story.<br /><br />Because of this play's constant evolution, I think the Luhrman version becomes acceptable viewing. He puts his own spin on it. He moderinizes it. He targets the very audience who is intrigued by tales of woe. Baz Luhrman makes the tragedy of Romeo and Juliet his for two hours. His approach puts a fresh face on a tragedy that is on DVD shelves with overacting players with heavy British accents. There's nothing wrong with that approach, it just doesn't pull in the average audience.<br /><br />The aspects of the movie I don't agree with are two-fold. The first disagreeable part is nothing major. To have the play shortened by leaving out scenes, I feel, is disprespectful to the script. I understand that two hours' traffic on stage is difficult to sell investors on, but it's the most famous tragedy of all time. If Baz Luhrman has no interest in filming every scene, then perhaps he should've prepared to find a way to make that happen. I also was not a fan of the many misattributed quotes - script altering - throughout the movie. Not only does production leave out scenes, but they switch lines to other characters. Again I felt this to be an egregious disregard for the script.<br /><br />The second aspect is on a broader scale. Leonardo Dicaprio plays a good Romeo. The problem is, he plays a good stereotypical Romeo. There are times in the movie where he seems to be an impulsive teenager as he should be. But it is Romeo's part within the script that is misunderstood. Many casual readers read the play assuming Romeo loves Juliet. In fact, Romeo is smitten with Rosaline and then does an about-face upon seeing Juliet. This is the first hint that Romeo really doesn't have feelings for Juliet. Even Friar Lawrence states in his cell that Romeo was babbling like a baby the day before over Rosaline and now today he's bubbling over Juliet.<br /><br />Juliet's quote of \\"You kiss by the book\\" could prove Romeo's lack of skills. Juliet could be shooting him down by saying his kiss was so basic that it seemed he learned it from some book. Again, Romeo seems to fit the bill of a teen-aged boy running astray. Furthermore, when Romeo swears by the moon he strikes out while attempting to steal Juliet off of her feet. His apathetic style seems perfect for the impressionable Juliet who seems to be running wild with puppy love. Finally Romeo asking if Juliet would leave him \\"so unsatisfied\\" shows Romeo's narcissistic behavior toward Juliet who apologizes for being too easy to be sweet-talked.<br /><br />Because of this, Romeo can be categorically labeled as misplayed on a regular basis. Perhaps eventually Romeo develops feelings for Juliet, and it could be the explanation behind him taking his own life. But since Dicaprio falls into the frustrating recurrence of Romeos who are struck with blind love from the get-go, it leaves me feeling bothered by a missed opportunity.<br /><br />As stated before it is certainly a movie worth considering. Mercutio's part was the best acted in my opinion as it wove in a theory of potential love between Romeo and him. Regardless of the theory, Meructio's lines roll off naturally. Claire Danes delivers a fairly decent performance as Juliet, and John Leguizamo as Tybalt is equally natural. I can understand where those who dislike the movie are coming from, and I can also understand the cult status this movie endures. I still believe it is worth at least one viewing especially if it pulls more readers into the intoxicating world of William Shakespeare.
B0057Q83SS|5.0|I just made a profile to ask if the people at the top of this review list are serious about asking \\"Can you really call Slipknot metal?\\" Are you serious?.... Have you heard IOWA? It's borderline black, death metal on IOWA!!... That album is basically Pure Hatred caught on wax. It's a  beautifully produced piece of history polished to a perfect gem by Ross Robinson. IOWA is a MASTERPIECE. Or \\"DISASTERPIECE\\" if you will. Best Album they ever put out or will. It was barely recorded while Ross was in a wheelchair. He is the Godfather of NU-METAL! He first recorded \\"Concrete\\" when he was like 19-20. Then he did Korn's, Bizkit's, and Slipknot's first landmark debuts... What a pimp? Buy IOWA if you love metal! Point Blank! It's that good. It's incredible. Actually, if you really love metal, it's a MUST HAVE!! Plus the Disasterpiece DVD is blackout nasty. 30 cameras on stage so you can switch to anyone in the band while the songs play. It's just the shiznit! Slipknot rules. IOWA is amazing. Maggot for life. Hope I shed some light on metal for the people up top. Hit me up. Haha! But, hopefully I just made someone a Slipknot fan... That's what matters. The music... It says everything that I can't put into words. Buy this as a Christmas gift for yourself if you were living in your car when metal/hardcore ruled in the first half of the 2000s.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I could do without the odd sounds but the game is fun and there are lots of levels to keep the game interesting and challenging.
0316069434|3.0|One problem with Michael Connelly's latest, The Black Box, is the cop-out where he doesn't give a reason for Mendenhall's actions. The motive didn't come to light and made the story seem less believable. Otherwise I liked the book and will read the next one.
B000W93CHC|4.0|A trip back through time to an era so different from our own, yet with all the characteristics of the human condition.  Brilliant writing, engaging characters, authentic historical setting and developments.  Follett is a master story teller with an eye for detail that brings to life the flavors of the age, the personalities and perspectives, the personal consequences of the sweep of history.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|So far, this has been the best season of this great show.  Unlike most sitcoms which are losing their creativity and originality by this stage (if they even last as many seasons), &#34;Big Bang Theory&#34; just keeps getting better.  It was a wise move to add the characters of Amy and Bernadette as regulars.  Their relationships with Sheldon and Howard have given us more to focus on than just the ones between Leonard and Penny, which can get a little irritating or frustrating at times, and the ones between the guys themselves.  Amy's attempts to take her relationship with Sheldon to the next level have been absolutely hilarious!  Here's hoping for another 6 seasons of this creatively nerdy show!!

I am really disappointed and upset because this was going to be a Christmas present and it looks like it was run over and then placed in a wrap. Not what I PAID FOR :( !!!
B009FXIICK|3.0|Zookeeper is a colorful little match 3 game, similar to Bejeweled and the like. It's plays just like you think it does, but in addition from the goal of reaching a higher score per game, you have to capture a number of specific animals to proceed onto the next stage. This can prove to be challenging in later levels when new animals are introduced and you have to strategically think on how to group them together. The game is pretty light in content - it only has 2 modes. A stage by stage main mode and an endless mode. The game has leaderboards, but unfortunately they are only local.<br /><br />Aside from the addition challenge of capture specific animals, the game sports a cute art style that I'm sure many will favor over simplistic shapes from other games in the genre. Overall, the game isn't the very best of it's kind but it's a worthy timewaster if you need a cute match 3 puzzler.
0743297334|5.0|Hemingway is Hemingway. The writing is clean and economic and always gets its point across. Lean and sturdy. Something like  Kerouac with more clarity and ease. He seems to effortlessly draw up such vivid imagery. I think it's in the negative space but he manages to leave me drooling for his world.<br />Hemingway is himself a hero of American literature for many reasons.

B009AMANBA|5.0|Since we've made a mystical giant out of Lincoln, which likely would amuse him and remind him of a story, it's a great relief that Spielberg gives us the man instead of the legend. For this, all gratitude and appreciation.<br /><br />Some people looked into Doris Kearns Goodwin's book and only found four pages on this period between the second election and second inauguration . . . so I'll recommend Michael Burlingame's \\"Lincoln: A Life\\" available in two volumes and probably 600 pp each. Burlingame's book is out only a few years and greatly treasured and respected by the other Lincoln scholars.<br /><br />Spielberg's also given Thaddeus Stevens his place in history as never before, and his story, which I found by searching around online after seeing the film (twice), is really remarkable.<br /><br />It's also good to know that the congressional obstructionist, George Pendleton I think is his name, behind the war against the 13th amendment had been the vice presidential running mate to George McClellan, the general who just would not fight the war and later ran against Lincoln for president. The congressman who was his running mate went back to congress with a little more clout since, after all, he might have been vice president.<br /><br />Am watching Paul Ryan to be running the same game all these years later with the obstructionists to Obama.<br /><br />This film is a little kinder to Mary than the full scope of information that appears in Burlingame's book. I like that Spielberg was a little kind to Mary because Lincoln himself was too.<br /><br />If anyone thinks the movie was unkind to Mary, again, more details in Burlingame's book. By using all sorts of resources contemporary to Lincoln, Burlingame mostly avoids the problem of seeing Lincoln as if looking back through time from our perspective. He only ventures into that when he speculates a little about possible factors in Lincoln's depressions or melancholy and relationships.<br /><br />Doris Kearns Goodwin's book is excellent too. She gives us Lincoln's cabinet in deliciously readable terms and Spielberg's cast reflects that superbly.<br /><br />Now I would like for Day Lewis and Spielberg to do other periods in Lincoln's career. The train ride from Springfield and the train ride back home. The Lincoln Douglas debates. A mini series on the big screen.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I don't understand why people had problems with this book. I thought it was great. It honored those who live, fight, and die to keep America safe.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|Am dismayed that award nominations so far for this film seem to have noticed only costume, make up, special effects. For me the film was so riveting and engaging and satisfying and stunning that I did believe I was seeing some nominations for acting and direction and screenplay as well.<br /><br />I wonder if I'm out in left field with this thinking or if other viewers feel the same. Reviewers here got me interested in reading the novel which I found just as wonderful and creatively satisfying. Okay, British novel, German movie, Germany's \\"first blockbuster\\" said someone. So what the heck?<br /><br />O well, special effects and costume/make up will have to do so far.<br /><br />As for the film, get ready to be amazed and appalled and touched and terrified and puzzled and disturbed. David Mitchell said of his novel that it is about predacity, how we are all predators upon one another. I am glad I saw that later because I would have said the film is about love. It is a love story in many different forms. Mitchell also suggested he was willing for the filmmakers to take some liberties with his novel and they did, but all to the good I think.<br /><br />I do see that being the top of the food chain, we humans are one another's predators all the time, aren't we, and everything else on the planet to our detriment. So our drama seems to be what kind of spirit do we bring to our experience.<br /><br />I loved the language and made a little dictionary of it from the book. Sometimes I like to speak it or think that way.<br /><br />Not a great sci fi buff and a rocking chair granny and talking like Zachr'y.<br /><br />Yay!<br /><br />So what's with the film awards critics?<br /><br />Maybe it's just a great year for quality work.<br /><br />I'll see it again. Exquisite work and acting. I'll have to have my own awards ceremony.

B000089770|5.0|I first saw this movie when in came out in 1995 and then bought the BD in 2012. It is still am amazing film about human nature, love and New York. This kind of stuff could only happen in New York. People of entirely different backgrounds crossing paths for an incredible series of adventures and misadventure. Yes, incredible, but then again this is a movie.<br /><br />However the emotions that play out in the story are very real, and no doubt will resonate with many viewers.<br /><br />One last note about the title: smoke is the common denominator of all the stories that intertwine in the course of the film, which is centered around daily life in a cigar store. A pretty unique place where the owner, disenchante with life, can meaningfully put together a series of albums of four thousand pictures of the same place. I won't tell you how this actually makes sense so as not to spoil the film for you. And, how do you weigh smoke? You actually can, really, just watch the movie!
0375869026|5.0|Well written from several characters' perspectives. I read this after a friend recommended it. I was not disappointed. Now my 10 yr old daughter is reading it. She's about 1/3 of the way through, and she loves it also! Great way to spark discussion about difficult tween/teen (and even adult!) subjects...stereotypes, bullying, inner strength...
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Not 5 stars because the meme is repetitive. Looks like a sequel in the works by the way the movie ended.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|well, I say the original game is much better than kindle fire addition.atleast you can play it on your kindle fire.<br />for me I say it is not the worst or best game in the world.<br />this is my opinion.
B003ZBX82I|4.0|James Taylor's long career has had many phases, but it did not start auspiciously. His early years produced a single poorly received, self-titled debut on Apple Records in 1968. It sank like a stone despite the presence of such classics as &#34;Carolina in My Mind&#34; and &#34;Something in the Way She Moves.&#34; Yet James' gentle voice belied a troubled soul. After a stint in rehab for a nasty heroin addiction that continued off and on until the early 1980s, and after recovering from a motorcycle accident in which he broke both hands and both feet, Taylor switched to Warner Brothers.<br /><br />He came roaring back with a string of seven extremely popular albums between 1970 and 1976. The first of these LPs, &#34;Sweet Baby James,&#34; was his most successful studio release, with singles like &#34;Fire and Rain,&#34; &#34;Country Road,&#34; and the title track, while the last, &#34;Greatest Hits,&#34; is his all-around bestseller. It brings together many of his finest songs: &#34;You've Got a Friend&#34; (by his friend Carole King), &#34;How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)&#34; (a sweet Motown cover), &#34;Shower the People&#34; (his last single for WB), and favorites like &#34;Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight,&#34; &#34;Walking Man,&#34; and &#34;Mexico.&#34;<br /><br />Signing with Columbia, Taylor began a third phase, maintaining his winning streak with the five platinum-sellers collected in &#34;Original Album Classics,&#34; a low-priced British import containing five remastered CDs in cardboard sleeves and a thin slipcase but no liner notes or booklet. Released between 1977 and 1988, these records offer songs of great depth and maturity, and the first three discs represent some of his most consistent and pleasing work. &#34;JT,&#34; the earliest, is replete with sunny tunes like &#34;Handy Man&#34; (an Otis Blackwell cover), &#34;Your Smiling Face&#34; (the album's second single), &#34;There We Are&#34; (a beautiful love song to Carly Simon, JT's wife), &#34;Bartender's Blues&#34; (a wonderful slice of life), and &#34;Terra Nova&#34; (written with Simon).<br /><br />Next is &#34;Flag,&#34; a relatively dark album emphasizing themes of grinding labor and heartbreaking betrayal. &#34;Company Man,&#34; &#34;Brother Trucker&#34; (which Taylor sang in the Broadway musical &#34;Working&#34;), &#34;Millworker,&#34; and &#34;Sleep Come Free Me&#34; all portray individuals struggling to survive, while &#34;I Will Not Lie for You&#34; and &#34;Rainy Day Man&#34; (a remake of a much earlier Taylor tune) depict conflicted people searching for lasting love but not finding it. Two covers, &#34;Day Tripper&#34; by Lennon and McCartney and &#34;Up on the Roof&#34; by Goffin and King, are nicely done.<br /><br />The last record released before Taylor and Simon divorced, &#34;Dad Loves His Work&#34; offered a kind of explanation for the dissolution of the marriage: he simply loved writing, performing, recording, and touring more than he loved her. The music is gorgeous and immaculate, but it has a mournful tone, and &#34;Hard Times,&#34; the opening song, is appropriate to the theme. Taylor deals directly with the rift in his life in &#34;Her Town Too,&#34; while &#34;Believe It or Not&#34; and &#34;I Will Follow&#34; are full of longing for love. &#34;Summer's Here&#34; is a happy but only momentary ray of sunshine before a return to the gloom of &#34;London Town.&#34; The album closes with a bleak choral piece, &#34;That Lonesome Road.&#34;<br /><br />I admit to being less enamored with the last two discs in this set, &#34;That's Why I'm Here&#34; and &#34;Never Die Young,&#34; which accounts for the loss of a star in my rating. They contain fine title tunes, an enjoyable single (&#34;Only One&#34;), and a catchy bauble (&#34;Sweet Potato Pie&#34;) as well as a sincere standard (&#34;My Romance&#34;) and a couple of charming covers (&#34;Everyday&#34; and &#34;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence&#34;). Much of the music seems similar to what came before, however, rather than a step forward, and the quality of the songwriting feels indifferent on a few tracks. Fortunately, Taylor initiated phase four of his career in 1993 with the excellent album &#34;New Moon Shine&#34; and superb songs like &#34;Copperline,&#34; &#34;(I've Got to) Stop Thinkin' 'bout That,&#34; &#34;Shed a Little Light,&#34; and others.<br /><br />A full track listing follows:<br /><br />CD 1: JT<br />1.

B0028MBKVG|5.0|Wow, an amazing read about the world of running, or I should say, ultrarunning.  I started the book when I began experiencing knee pain with running and am now trying the zero drop concept and even some barefoot running!!
B000FC130E|5.0|Anyone who's ever read any of Haruki Murakami's novels (The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle in particular) should enjoy this story immensely. Just as Murakami takes us into the 'under'world of Tokyo, meeting strange characters that nobody else seems to notice, Gaiman populates Neverwhere with a multitude of characters, both human and inhuman, that take the protagonist on a surreal journey through London. Another similarity I noticed was the personality of the authors' protagonists: both are men in their late 20s who seem to have the ability to become successful in the business world, but not the desire; both also have women who seem to focus on those abilities and be unaware of the lack of desire. I'm not one to reveal spoilers, so I won't go into details, but if you're a reader who likes allegorical urban fantasy this book is for you.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I am having a hard time reading this book. It is very boring and all the characters are  introduced in a confusing manner making it hard to follow.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|An excellent addition to the Bourne storyline! This movie ties in excellently with all of the previous movies but creates a good conclusion.... For now....
B00540G3G6|5.0|My daughter wanted this movie, the first time she saw it, she was dancing and singing.  The story and the melodies are really beautifull.
B00870ZH3U|2.0|Gotta say, this was pretty horrid.  Only one good song in the whole thing.  Nice concept I guess. Only die hard Phantom fans would bother with this.
B003INBNXO|5.0|great guy move wife doesn't like it but then she doesn't do martial arts will be looking foward to the others the third one you can watch on youtube tho
B005TZFZJC|4.0|I am liking rihanna more and more.  Never really cared for her before but am loving her music. So I am likley to buy more
B0094BB4TW|1.0|My feedback is the same as most.  The newsfeed is limited. I guess I will continue to use my iPhone for it when I travel.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|This album was a great listen. I love her voice and singing along with the songs. Definitely will be buying records by this band in the future!
1609611543|4.0|This book came highly recommended from a friend who took the authors advise. Hadn't seen her in awhile. She looks great and attributes it following the book's edict of &#34;no wheat&#34; (as well as a few other glutenous grains).  On a few topics the writer almost comes off sounding like a conspiracy theorist.  I am a personal trainer so nutrition is always on my radar. i have been on his wheat free diet for 15 days and i can definitely see a reduction of fat around my bell area.  I'm still a work in progress...
0374275637|5.0|A fascinating, insightful theory on how we think and process information, with practical applications for improving the quality of the judgments we make by understanding how our own thought processes work. Not a self-help or philosophy book by any means: but the idea that we can recognize and control the way we think is intriguing. Written in a breezy, practical but still scientifically precise way (lots of research, explanations and citations), this book is terrific.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|I love this soul brother! I was able to rock out with this album, then light one up, then tear up from his love songs! This CD has all the highs and lows of life! I love it!
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Great condition! I bought this for a friend because she loves Final Fantasy as much as I do and I know she'll love it! Ordered it yesterday and it just came in!
B008LY9AWG|5.0|I am an avid reader and I love Michael Connelly's books!  I just think it's great to get three in one!
1451695195|4.0|Very interesting!  I'm still reading this book, but I am fascinated by the experiences of Dr. Alexander.  I would definitely recommend this book.
B0048WQDIE|5.0|This is a very funny book because anyone who served during war can identify with the insanity that Yossarian endured.  I read it in high school, but I identify with it much more now that I've gone through two wars.  A must read!
0345803485|1.0|I don't like writing bad reviews because I believe there is merit to every story. Therefore, I decided to give 50 Shades a chance due to its popularity. I could not even make it past chapter 10, because the predictable story holds absolutely no hook at all. The chararcters are unbelievably stereotypical, and the plot pace is oddly sporadic. The first few chapters are extremely dry, but the further you progress the more rushed the sex seems. The sex did not excite me at all, and like the characters, are unbelievably cliche and predictable. If you like interesting, enveloping characters, then you will surely not appreciate the melodramatic and annoyingly flustered protagonist. I sympathized with neither Ana nor Christian. Her \\"inner goddess\\" and his \\"domination\\" are just too ridiculous to fathom.<br /><br />I have read countless erotic novels, including gay romances, and I must say that 50 Shades does not deliver in excitement or engrossment. Whether you want a good story or steamy sex, this book has neither.
B004UC4HCG|5.0|Couldn't believe the price of this barebone system but it works very good.  It is fully VMware compatible and it is a great addition to my VMware environment.  Allows me to failover VM's to it with no problems or performance issues.
B0012BV9FG|5.0|At first I was concerned about the price of this dinosaur, but it's well worth it.  It's hefty, well colored and lifelike!  I'm sure it will be a favorite with my grand kids!
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game really has a lot of potential!  It isn't nearly as large as Where's My Water now, but it could well become so.  More importantly though, it is just as fun.  I love it that they have something from the great Phineas and Ferb show!
B005FISBTO|5.0|The product was delivered as promised.  The price was very competitive.  I would recommend this DVD series to every one
B006LSZECO|2.0|Flynn really has a way with words and grabs your attention from the get-go.  i couldn't put it down and was so excited to share it with friends and family...<br /><br />but then i got to the end and it totally turned me off.  i felt confused, deflated, and cheated.  to me it felt like she got too close to her deadline, and just got lazy so just threw together an ending and pushed send.<br /><br />i'm hoping her other books can change my mind.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|This was easy to use, fun and the sound effects were quite satisfying!  Great portable fun.  Graphics were nice as well.
B000N2HCM4|4.0|It's nice to read about our President's roots.  I enjoyed the book, and it was very well written.  I would have loved pictures in it too, but there were none.  My only complaint :)
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Funny and drama, a great combo. I am glad there keeping this on for another season. keeps you interest every min
B008QTV3X0|5.0|The mysteries and possibilities are endless. The acting is superb. The pilot makes me want to see the rest of the series. What more could you want.
B009329Y30|4.0|Good romantic movie. The vibe is a lot mellower than The Notebook. The pairing seemed odd like some people said because the female lead seems a bit too old and the chemistry was lacking. But all in all, it is worth watching if you enjoy romances.
B008DW6VOQ|3.0|it is cool, but get ads  when you turn it on, i have looked online and they it cost 15 dollars to get rid of the ads&#62;
B009FXIICK|5.0|So fun, I am constantly wearing out my battery and charging it all the time to play more. Highly recommended.
B005H0IW6W|4.0|I didn't really care for spending that much for a CD that you can only really listen to for a short period of time throughout the year, but it was a gift, I was also disappointed when I found it cheaper at Barnes & Nobel.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Once that I started to read I could not stop, I read for more then 10 hours on the role. I finish to read all 3 books in one week and enjoyed a lot. It is not a perfect book, but it is like a blockbuster movie excited and fun. Good for a reining week.
B0049IHX2C|4.0|I like the movie.  I am not sure how the disc is, I know there was a disc though, It was a gift.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Eben writes with persuasive clarity.  His technical understanding adds depth to his narrative, giving those who have read accounts go other NDE's a greater understanding of the relationship of soul to body.  His account genuinely is compelling evidence of life beyond the last earthly breath.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|I was surprised I liked this book so much.  The examples are fascinating and I learned a lot. It's a worthwhile read for anyone.
1609611543|5.0|A very enlightening book.  I am hoping to become healthier due to changing my eating habits as put forth in this well written book.  Thank you.
034580404X|2.0|This trilogy is highly overrated.  Characters are lackluster.  Save your money, if you want steamy pick up a novel by Lora Leigh
B001DWXUWY|5.0|I love this album. I love the singer's gravelly voice and touching lyrics. Each song tells a story.This album is for people who listen to the lyrincs more than the music.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Actually, Betty Zurla read the book,not Robert.  A great book on Family dynamics,love, freindship , dogs and fantasy.  I do believe that our pets know know how  important they are to us . I feel sorry for anyone who hasn't been owned by a pet.
B000URX1DG|4.0|This is the kind of cd I would listen to on a hazy fall or winter day. Very soft  and fuzzy indie pop.
B007PKSN6Q|4.0|Well in this case some can and really good too......its a good album specially if you liked the movie....buy it when its on sale...
B006ZDU7QI|4.0|Gotye has crafted a surprisingly good and trancy throwback to nineties house music. I Enjoyed it more than I expected to.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|Great acting....just three episodes a year is poor....Bernedict and Martin need more work!....still Jeremy Brett is my favorite Holmes...check out the American series...Elementary which is not bad..once you get use to the idea of Dr.Watson been a female....good acting and good scripts....
B00A12VW86|3.0|The main draw for me is &#34;It's F^&*ing Time which is a hilarious little jam. I could take or leave the rest of the album.
B005LAII1C|4.0|His name is Ted.  He's a teddy bear brought to life by the wish of a lonely child.  But as all children do, the pair grew up.  The world accustomed itself to a talking stuffed animal, so much so that Ted is now a stoner who hangs around with his thunder buddy John.  John is in a relationship with the stunning Lori.  But after four years, Lori gets fed up, and forces John to make a choice: her or the bear.<br /><br />It could've been a one-joke pony; and, with Seth MacFarlane at the helm, that was a definite possibility.  MacFarlane's work is hit-and-miss; for every gut-busting episode of FAMILY GUY or AMERICAN DAD, there's one that simply flops.  However, MacFarlane has managed to bring the zaniness of his TV work to the big screen, creating the best so-stupid-it's-kinda-smart movie since the first HANGOVER.  The jokes come quick and often, with the randomness that made FAMILY GUY such a hit (this is basically an extended episode, which is both as good and troublesome as you may expect).<br /><br />The cast features several FAMILY GUY alum, as well as some stellar celeb cameos.  Giovani Ribisi disappears into his role as a creep with a Ted fetish; Joel McHale excels as Lori's horny boss; and Patrick Stewart provides some excellent (and hilarious) narration.  But the heart and soul here is the trio: Mark Wahlberg, proving finally that he has the comedic chops he's been trying to convince us he has; Mila Kunis, matching him step for step; and the true star, director/writer/producer Seth MacFarlane, who voices Ted to perfection.  The bear truly comes alive; kudos to the CG team for making such a realistic animated star.  However, without MacFarlane's vocal screen presence, the film could have fallen flat.  Instead, we've got a raunchy laugh-fest.  Granted, it's not for everyone: if teddy bears making love on produce isn't your thing, you may want to look elsewhere.  But for FAMILY GUY fans, or for people who enjoy comedy that's not quite so high-brow, TED is a must-see..
B007Y1ARLA|4.0|I like this better than their last album. Under the Iron Sea is a favorite of mine and this is heading back in that direction from their last cd.
076790592X|4.0|Very fast shiping and happy with product, over all satisfied totally A+ A+ A+ A+ A+ A+ A+ A+ A+
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|The movie was entertaining, but very drawn out. It was much less batman-focused than you would expect it to be. It did not stay on par with the previous two films in the series. A good watch, if you have three hours to kill.
