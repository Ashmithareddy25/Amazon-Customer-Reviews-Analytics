B0074D3CAQ|5.0|One of the best stories I have read in a while.  I felt while I was reading, that this story must be about real people. Of course it's a work of fiction but the story and its characters are written about so well that it seems your reading about actual events.  This book is great!  I know I am very lucky to have stumbled upon it by chance.  I believe anyone else who reads this book will feel the same.
B009OA57MI|4.0|It's really cool.except I wish they included more missions and more planes. But it's fun to try to land on the carrier
1451648537|5.0|What one thinks when turning over the first page of the book is: \\"OK. Here I am starting to read the history of a person who used to be a good CEO of the company me and my friends are so keen on.\\"<br /><br />Well, what I thought by the end of it is \\"I will definitely make my offspring read the book and I really wonder what will there reaction be. And I will be so proud to tell them I had a chance to be a contemporary to this man.\\"<br /><br />Indeed, this is not a history of a man. Instead, this is the history of reinventing the world from \\"how it is\\" to \\"how it should be!\\". One has to be extraordinarily rude, to dare to say to the universe \\"Here is what you are...But I would suggest you to become this, and I am sure You will be looking better this way.\\"<br /><br />Steve Jobs was an extraordinary type of a person and a leader. In my opinion, his character is hardest of all to be described.<br /><br />Walter Isaacson has chosen the probably best way to give you the fusion of his personality and his history. The quotes from the interviews of his friends, colleagues, family members give you the real idea of who Steve Jobs really was, rather than giving you the \\"ready to just read story\\" full of the dictating opinions of the biographer himself. The book lets you decide: You like Steve's way of living and CEOing or you completely hate that.<br /><br />However, no matter what you decide of the above mentioned, one is true: You are getting totally crazy about getting to know how the product you might be currently reading the book in, or have currently watched at local cinema, or have manyfold dreamed of to buy, were created, \\"idea-ed\\" and brought to you.<br /><br />Now it is easier to imagine, What would Henry Fords contemporaries feel, when reading his story in a local newspaper.
B004GYNPL2|2.0|I have used this App for 5 years roughly. First on my iphone and never had issues. Then I moved to an Android device with ease. Lately though I can no longer  backup or restore my data on either my Android Phone or my Ipad. All the support documents talk about your WiFi network. First why does the App on my devices force me to use Static IP? 2nd why can i only talk to MBackup on the PC via WiFi. If I am connected through USB that should be the preferred connection and is not even an available option at this point. Nothing has changed with the settings of my WiFi network yet for some reason this App can no longer find any of my 3 computers (BTW they are all running different Operating Systems.<br /><br />I am so fed up with this app, I can send backup to my gmail but my phone cannot recover it. The Gmail backup asks for your password instead of using built in gmail authentication. Are they stealing my data,and email? In addition I may not trust a drop box backup, I don't want my backup in the cloud when the hackers break into dropbox or msecure's parent company and get access to our data. Just give me a USB backup option. Then fix the WI-FI option and I will change my rating back.<br /><br />Customer service was no help.

0071771263|4.0|yes, the book is specilly for the conversation, reading and listenning. I thought have been gramatical, but this is include in the text.<br />For me is more advanced than my level, but i found a good methodology for the pratic the listening and improve my english. After more steps and study more, the book will be good for to do the toefl test.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Cute story line, easy read.  It's something that could and probably does happen in Vegas. It's a little confusing with the constant flashbacks but it does all come together at the end.
B0045XICB2|2.0|I DO understand why it's so popular. The story line is interesting, but:<br />The acting is incredibly wooden on the part of the two leads. And I'm just not feeling the chemistry at. all.<br />Dakota Fanning? She needs to evolve and mature.<br />I really tried to like these movies. I've given up.

B0092ZEIN4|1.0|This product is still advertised with touch mapping support.  The software to do this is still in beta.  The advertised touch mapping is not included in the current version of the app.  As of writing, this app has not been updated in about 6 months.<br />Normally, beta refers to software still in active development, feature complete but still buggy.  The app is neither feature complete, nor, it seems, in active development.  At this point, it looks like there may never be touch mapping support for this pad.  I would love to be proven wrong.<br />I cannot recommend purchasing a product that doesn't have all stated functionality 6 months after release.  By Nyko's own classification of the playground app as BETA, they admit it is not release quality.<br />AVOID!
B003NRYMZQ|3.0|British show with average special effects and limited appeal to true sci-fi fans...if you love the type of sci-fi that is more fluff than stuff...here you go!

B0054JZC6E|5.0|My 6 year old plays this game and he loves it! Keeps him busy for quite awhile. We would totally recommend this game!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm a serious Sci-fi addict, and chain-reader. I've always got a book I'm nursing, and I love epic, well developed stories. The wool series was an incredible find. I couldn't put it down!  Such a well thought out world, & interesting relatable characters.  All the tools, equipment, and infrastructure were also realistic & not oversimplified. I was impressed with descriptions of how things worked—thats really what brought the story alive for me.<br />Thanks for keeping the books affordable Hugh, and also for your excellent editing—didn't find a single error in the book.  5 stars!
B009X01C64|5.0|I bought a Marware case for my 2nd Kindle several years ago.  When I upgraded to the 8.9\\" Kindle I was wanting another Marware case, but wasn't sure I could find one for the newer sized Kindle.  Then I found it!  This Marware case revolves and makes it so easy to read in almost any position--revolve from an 8.9\\" portrait page to a 8.9\\" landscape page. It's sturdy in any position you set up. The case is soft black leather and looks sharp wherever or whenever you read or work with your Kindle Fire HD. My Kindle snaps right into the protective plastic frame. The one thing I didn't like about the smaller case was that it was awkward to charge my Kindle and read at the same time, but with this revolving frame, I just turn it around and plug it in and keep reading. I most definitely recommend the Marware revolving case for any Kindle Fire HD user.
B001AGXEA6|5.0|I just realized they misspelled the title. Weird. Classic Tim Burton film from my childhood and was a joy to watch in BluRay.

B004GHYCKW|4.0|I listened to this album/disc when it first came out and read all the raves about how brilliant it was IF you are English.  Well, I'm not - which is maybe why it took me until a listen today to decide that this is an excellent effort.  To me, nothing will rival TBYML, but this is an amazing disc in theme and production.  Not a fan equally of ALL the songs but the bright spots keep me pining for PJ.  We're so lucky to have her gift of music.  Still waiting for a Siouxsie/PJ duet.... in my dreams!

1451695195|2.0|Having read a couple of books on NDE, I was very dissapointed in this book.  I found it difficult to read and to follow.  Lost interest and mostly skimmed it except for the part regarding his reactions to his adoption after so long a time.  Did not even pass it on to others to read.  Not worth the money.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This is a very good movie for kids and I give it 5 stars because my grandchildren love it. They love the Dr Suess movies and I highly recommend this one too.

B0095VP8D4|5.0|I did much research to create a budget PC build. After reading forums, watching youtube videos etc, I finally decided to go with this AMD A10-5800k APU. This APU is highly capable. I mostly use my new build for web browsing, excel, word, light gaming, and some video/photo processing. It is MORE THAN CAPABLE to perform all these duties. It runs Starcraft 2 on 1920x1080 on all High Settings with no issues whatsoever! I went with an aftermarket cooler because I may overclock it later on.<br /><br />Below are my components:<br /><br />CPU: AMD A10-5800k<br />MoBo: ASRock FM2A75 Pro4<br />HD: Samsung 120 GB SSD MZ-7TD120BW 2.5\\" 120GB SATA III<br />Case: Coolermaster 430 Elite<br />PSU: Corsair CX430<br />OS: Windows 7<br />RAM: G.

For 99% of people, you do not need a high-end, expensive PC with features that most programs won't even utilize to its potential. If you are looking for a capable unit on a budget, and do light gaming, GET THIS!
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Everything I want in a novel, an escape from the everyday allowing emersion with interesting characters and events. Kate Morton brings to life the London blitz, a happy 1960s childhood, and the unsettled adult searching for an explanation of events and weaves them together with great skill. A thoroughly enjoyable book the sort that makes you wish the bus ride to work took longer ! Enjoyed it so much I am reading another Morton now.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We loved this program and can hardly wait to watch season three. One of the best TV programs in some time.
B00AEFY6ZQ|5.0|This is one of my alltime favorite movies. I love the action and the actors. The scenery of African animals being captured for a zoo is exciting and totally realistic.
B00AFEXRME|2.0|Thought this was going to be a suspenseful movie about an airliner crash.  Wrong.  It began with a nudie scene and went downhill from there.  The inter-racial sex scenes made me gag.  I don't want to view a film about dysfunctional addicts who sleep around -- plenty of that in real life.  I wanted an action/suspense movie for entertainment.  I'm usually a Denzel Washington fan, so I felt let down.  Oh well, there are bound to be a few decent films out there somewhere, someday.
B006FE83V8|5.0|A classic, moving story from the era of the South, that began the movement for justice and equality for all people.

B00B69UQEO|4.0|As a long-time DM fan I always eagerly anticipate any new material from the band. I enjoyed quite a few songs from Sounds of the Universe when it came out and overall consider it to be a solid effort. However, at least for me, their last album didn't stand the test of time that well and the only songs I frequently revisit are \\"Wrong\\" and, ironically, a B-side track \\"Ghost\\" and Alan Wilder's gorgeous remix of \\"In Chains\\". I don't believe it will be the case with Delta Machine. Dave's voice aged phenomenally well and lyrically this album seems to be stronger than its predecessor as well (although the number of times the word \\"soul\\" is used across all the song is a bit too high). Musically, there are far more memorable songs and Flood's production reins in the retro synth style and gives it a lot more polished and elegant sound. Standout songs for me are Alone, Broke, Secret to the End, Goodbye, Should be Higher, Heaven and a B-track Always. The weakest song, in my opinion, is The Child Inside.  How does this album compare to the rest of DM's catalog? I would say it is not exactly on par with my favorite DM albums such as Violator and Ultra, but it is a notch above Exciter and Playing the Angel. Overall, I believe DM fans should not be disappointed!

B00846REIS|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  More realistic than Fifty Shades.  At times it made me cry, and other times, smile.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book is fantastic. I picked it up after recommendation, and I love it so far. I'm about halfway through. It's very good for anybody who's excited about the future and who loves cyberpunk fiction and dystopian societies. The quest of the main character is exciting and captivating.<br /><br />The worst part is that it has to end! Highly recommended.

B00C2D0OKO|4.0|I REALLY LIKED THIS SHOW the cast really does a great job as they always do. Hope everyone liked this show too
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|My 3 year old daughter loves this movie, and honestly so do I.  When it came out she wanted to watch it almost everyday.  Everyone from Gramma and Gramdpa to the little ones will enjoy this movie.  This is not a rent once and return movie, this is a buy it and make it part of your collection movie.  Do your family a favor and get this movie.
B004GJYR7S|4.0|I was disappointed with myself for not ordering a copy with a DVD version of the movie.  I do not like being tied down to only one device for viewing.  I cannot view this on my computer or DVD player.  Yes, I realize that Blu-ray only plays in Blu-ray players, but I thought I had ordered Blu-ray and DVD together.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Never a real David Bowie fan I decided to give The Next Day a chance. Wow! I have been blown away. The 14 plus 3 songs are out of the world. Bowie is brilliant. All songs have become personal favorites. Some are classics - Stars, Dancing Out in Space, Love is Lost and You Feel So Lonely You Could Die. These would have been big hits a couple of decades ago. Wish the album had come out then. But even today it all sounds so fresh. The voice, the lyrics, the guitars, sax, synths, and the drums make this a smooth, classy album. It is one of the best albums I have heard in a very very long time.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|I am a true Harry Potter fan.  I read all the books before watching the movies, and I think the movies move away from the books somewhat.  I still think the movie series is the best rendition of a book series I have ever seen.
B001AGNRYO|5.0|This is one of the greatest folk albums ever created, by one of the best song writers of the past. Do yourself a favor and just get it.<br /><br />The vinyl is thick and plays well, and the record sleeve is a beautiful gatefold with lyrics.<br />5/5

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Seriously... It's just like real life...  Like the other day I was driving (a car), and a deer ran out in front of me (in the car) and I swear Katniss was chasing it with a bow and arrow.  I always knew it was real!
B002DQDV6Y|3.0|I wanted to try a Harry Potter movie as I loved the books.  I found I prefer the books but the movies can provide a good way to kill and evening too.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|This amplifier has increased the amount of sound coming out of my headphones by at least triple and tremendously increased the bass and it doesn't affect the battery life too much
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|This is even better than the first. Well worth the money. I love the fact that these include multi use disks.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|For the fifty (or forty) year-olds considering this read:  if you can stand to spend more than a few minutes on the yellow bus, the deeper experience of life at school is revealed in a way that is satisfying and open to interpretation.  If only to be reminded of the incredibly creative 80's, THE MUSIC, and how \\"globalization\\" became \\"tolerance\\"...I thank the author for this simple non-judgemental treatment of a time when the world went from parochial to cosmopolitan in a moment.<br />I felt for these kids, much my junior, and for the Shift I enjoyed as a college KID SEEKING OUT THE WORLD.<br />No idea how youngsters will feel it, but the story stuck with me.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Another great season! Just like the first two seasons, couldn't wait to watch the next episode. All of the characters are interesting and actors do a good job in their roles.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I BOUGHT THIS GAME AND IT ROCKED I mean I thought it was like the PC version but no better
0316228532|2.0|I think the author really did put an effort into separating this book from her Harry Potter books. The language is hard to read, it's awkward and choppy. The narrative itself jumps from one set of characters to the next every couple of pages, and i found it very hard to keep track of who is who and what role they play. I could not finish the book, could not follow easily the story line. So, maybe if you have the patience it may get more familiar and easier to follow. Overall, not a good summer read. Rather pompous and disconnected and overloaded. Keep it simple!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The love story underlining these books is powerful and a good read. I enjoyed all of them. Yes there are some things in the books that may turn you off but you can choose to focus on them or not and just enjoy the story line.

B00BCZU8WM|3.0|I like Justin Timberlake's music. I don't love Justin Timberlake's music. He has undeniable talent. But as a long time music listener I take issue with some of his choices.<br /><br />First, it's pretty clear that Timberlake prefers soul/rhythm & blues/hip hop/rap. For me, he also continues to tread the same ground Michael Jackson and Prince once walked. Naturally, I grew up with those two artists while Timberlake came much later, and I really was too old for *NSYNC/'N SYNC, and boy bands in general in the late 1990's. Truth be told, I never really liked any boy bands, period. Timberlake has broken away from his boy band roots, but if you asked me, I would take Robbie Williams over Timberlake any day in terms of singers who have broken away from boy bands. Just to be clear, click over to Robbie Williams' \\"Candy\\" from his latest album, watch the video, too, on YouTube, and see/hear what I'm talking about. He is a far superior boy band artist that Timberlake, and he doesn't rely on the same producer/style for his albums like Timberlake.<br /><br />The next agenda item is the length of the songs on \\"The 20/20 Experience\\". I've read the complaints about how the songs are too long, they have too many changes and segues (but \\"FutureSex/LoveSounds\\" had a similar style). Would it shock music listeners of today to know that in the late 1960's/early 1970's, bands like King Crimson, Yes, Genesis, Rush, and Emerson, Lake & Palmer typically had songs that went longer than 10 minutes? How about classical music, too? Beethoven had many songs that went longer than 10 minutes and numerous shifts throughout a piece. So, what's the problem with Timberlake's approach? I don't see/hear one. This is progressive soul now instead of progressive rock or classical music.<br /><br />The complaint that all the songs sound the same is unfounded. At first listen, I can see how someone would think it true, but after numerous listens each track sets itself apart from the next. Are all 10 tracks great? Well, no. In fact, I think \\"Spaceship Coupe\\" is the weakest track here, and its lyrics are cringe-worthy. Also, \\"That Girl\\" is a bit weak as well, and \\"Let The Groove Get In\\" seems to go nowhere, and is an exercise in repetitiveness. \\"Suit & Tie\\" was a good choice for first single, and is a favorite. \\"Mirrors\\" is also another favorite, although it treads dangerously close to OneRepublic territory. Many reviewers have cited \\"Blue Ocean Floor\\" as an interesting and standout track, and I have to agree, it's somewhat different for Timberlake, but also a noted track here. Elsewhere, \\"Pusher Love Girl\\", \\"Don't Hold The Wall\\", \\"Strawberry Bubblegum\\" and \\"Tunnel Vision\\" hold up the rest of the album pretty well. There are two bonus tracks on the deluxe edition that I have not 'experienced', and so can't attest to here.<br /><br />So, \\"The 20/20 Experience\\" is good, enjoyable, but not classic or great. It's similar to his past two solo albums, but shows a bit more maturity. I say only a bit more because the lyrics to several songs \\"Pusher Love Girl\\", \\"Don't Hold The Wall\\", \\"Strawberry Bubblegum\\", \\"Spaceship Coupe\\", \\"That Girl\\" and \\"Let The Groove Get In\\" are rather juvenile for a 32 year old to write. That's where Robbie Williams outdoes Timberlake--he's clever, and often has something more substantial to say than Timberlake.<br /><br />In order for Timberlake to move up to Michael Jackson or Prince status he is going to have to really outdo himself, and, of course, he is going to have to incorporate more into his music than just the genre of soul/rhythm & blues/hip hop/rap. I mean, the reason Michael Jackson and Prince are cornerstones in pop music is they knew how to mix up their styles with many, many other styles. I don't think Timberlake has really done something as original and innovative as, say, \\"When Doves Cry\\" or \\"Beat It\\", but he did come close with songs like \\"SexyBack\\", \\"My Love\\", \\"LoveStoned\\" and \\"What Goes Around\\", and nothing on \\"The 20/20 Experience\\" comes close to those tracks, sorry to say. And, I might add that although I appreciate and enjoy Timbaland as a producer, he is not Quincy Jones, and Prince always produced his own material which, many times in the 1980's, was just pure genius.

And, I might add that although I appreciate and enjoy Timbaland as a producer, he is not Quincy Jones, and Prince always produced his own material which, many times in the 1980's, was just pure genius.

B00B99KJR0|5.0|So addictive that I cant stop playing. Love the game. Love the challenge. I do wish there were more difficult levels.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Flynn sucks you in with elegant writing and dark realistic point of view from the characters. I hated the ending.
B0064MGU98|5.0|She is wonderful in this role, and each segment keeps you guessing about how things will unfold next. Great series
B008PNBU30|3.0|I'll keep this short and simple. This CD is good, it's definitely Three Days Grace (maybe not classic TDG though), but I still find myself loving half the songs, and getting bored with the other half. One X is still their best CD to date where I can appreciate every song. So I'll break down which songs I love, like, and which ones are just okay.<br /><br />Love: Sign of the Times, Chalk Outline, The High Road, Anonymous, Happiness, Give Me a Reason<br />Like: The High Road, The Time That Remains, Unbreakable Heart<br />Eh: Operate, Misery Loves My Company, Give In To Me, Broken Glass<br /><br />Overall, a good CD, but nothing spectacular. If you like Three Days Grace, this CD is worth a buy. If you're iffy, I'd say buy individual songs.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This was an engrossing story with just the right amount of magic and romance. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this story.
B007RE0SCW|5.0|my granddaughter loved them she did not have any and it made her Christmas and mine I would recommend this sellar and product to everyone.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I love the movement of the cards.  Easy to play and win.  I got it for my kindle fire while I was played up to pass the time.  Very entertaining.

B001LF347E|5.0|We love the Merliin series, SAD TO SEE IT GO!! We have started buying the series a year at a time.
B0064MGU98|3.0|It could be good drama, but not for me.  I couldn't get into the story of drama.<br />It's just my point of view.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|A good continuation of the first Temple Run....we enjoy playing it.....my grandkids are much better than I am!!  We'd recommend it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is totally awesome<br />I like that I can join severs with friends I love this game  highly recommended
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I an a 11 year-old kid and I love this game.It is soooo fun.There is really no flaw to this game.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Great game!! Basically taught me how to play chess. However it can be frustrating when the computer doesn't allow a move, knowing if playing in real life you wouldn't have the computer preventing moves on your king. That's my only qualm with the game though. otherwise its fast, no pop ups whatsoever, challenging, addiicting, and easy to play with two players!!! Would suggest to a pro or a begginer.
B008I3RARW|5.0|To me this app is really fun!!! Maybe if you where in you thirties it wouldn't be fun but great for kids best race game for kids although only one car and same track.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|The case is secure and the strap stays in place, however, the four corners that actually hold the Kindle are a little weak. I secure mine in my purse in a section that doesn't allow it to  move. If you are putting yours in a satchel or briefcase, the Kindle might fall out of the carrier. Just be careful. Otherwise, this case works well and I can plug in for recharging without removing the Kindle from the case.
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|Saw this movie in theaters right about the time it came out and it was excellent. It has so many twists and I loved the actors in it. Definitely a movie worth watching maybe even a few times :p By far one of my favorites from Nicholas Sparks
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|I bought this movie and I've already watched it twice.  My grandson loves it too . . . so I'm sure we will get plenty of use out of it.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|it very very awsome and i'm a person that loves horses and when i played this game i thought that it would help me learn more and more about horses so if you like horses then My Horse is the kind of game recommend for you
B00BSBY38A|4.0|There's pain, there's fear and lots of action for a movie that takes place on a 'lifeboat'. One of the best movies this has produced. I tip my hat to the director, the actors, including the 'Tiger' and to the special effects folks that put this movie together.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Those who say the movie is slow really miss the point--even though I knew the final outcome it held our attention Cast was great
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|The cinematography was exceptional but the plot and path it took left me dozing off. It was a bit of a let down. The problem may have been my expectations were too high. To bad, it could of been a winner.
B005XQ973M|4.0|I use a Kindle reader for iPad. When you finish a book, Amazon always pops in asking for a review. I had to ignore this for this book, because I wasn't ready to write yet, needing time to process what I had just read!<br /><br />Having taken several days to process, I can say I am certainly glad I read this book. Having read extensively about the Armenian Genocide, the Holocaust and other 20th century atrocities, I was shocked at having never heard of this massacre.<br /><br />It was a hard book to read. Hard, because of the content, and hard because it exploded my preconceptions of the Japanese as being always gentle, kind people. I have always harbored guilt for the internment of the Japanese on American soil. I still feel some shame, having many colleagues of Japanese ancestry whose families were uprooted from there homes and sent away. But this book put that period into more of a context to perhaps understand what a previous generation did, since these crimes were front page news in 1937-1938.<br /><br />I will not do an extensive review of the content, since others have summarized this very well. But, it is the story about the Japanese Imperial Army taking the Capitol of China, which was then called Nanking (now Nanjing), at the end of 1937, as part of the Sino-Japanese war. They were brutal to the Chinese civilians, slaughtering hundreds of thousands in cruel ways, including beheading, using humans for sword practice spearing infants and adults, and raping tens of thousands of Chinese women. Remember I said civilians, non-combatants. They took few, if any POWs, executing Chinese soldiers, and any male they thought could be a soldier, post haste on entering the city. The Yangtze River was clogged with dead bodies, and blood ran in the streets, as they couldn't bury them as fast as they killed them.<br /><br />I know, having read some of the writings from the Japanese, that there are deniers among many of that people. I also know that some historians take issue with some of her history telling and facts. Having read extensively about the Armenian Massacre in Turkey that began in April 1915, and killed hundreds of thousands, if not millions of the Armenian people, I know there are many who deny this mostly unknown holocaust as well. I am convinced the Turkish government and the Japanese government just want to deny their horrendous behavior, avoid the shame, and the paying of any reparations. Shame on them!<br /><br />I am in the medical field, and we have peer review for any medical work which is published, so I understand the need to criticize some facts that may not be correct or strictly confirmed by historical records. But even if some of this is wrong, it would be hard to convince me this never happened. They can argue about the numbers of dead and raped, but this massacre happened.<br /><br />I am thankful that Iris Chang wrote this history/remembrance. I am saddened that she took her own life after writing it, and before she could finish her book on the Bataan Death March, which would have expanded my knowledge of another atrocity.  I would highly recommend picking up this book. As has been said, we should not ignore where we came from, and we do so at our own peril!<br /><br />The subject quote above is from George Fitch's diary, a member of the International Committee for the Protection Zone, created by expatriots to try and save as many Chinese as they could! They thus bore witness to the slaughter!<br />I would give this 4.5 stars.with some of her history telling and facts.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love this series, would never have watched it, had it not been for Prime. Can't wait for Season 3. Try it, you'll love it!
B00B69UQEO|5.0|At first I was surprised how \\"slow\\" the songs were but playing it several times I now appreciate every song. Very well recorded, probably one of their best.<br />Sound stage and imaging is top notch. Martin has taken his imaging of songs from his recent collaboration with Vince Clarke (VCMG) and applied it here.<br />Some sound effects in songs bring back memories of Violator/Ultra albums. I preferred this album to Sounds of Universe.<br /><br />Can't wait to see them on this tour (for the 7th time).
B00A3SGWYC|4.0|While I don't feel that this album was quite as good as Planet Pit, it was still a good purchase.<br />I dig his sound, his music just makes me want to get up and move.
141659521X|5.0|As usual Vince Fynn writes a entertaining story, he has became one of my favorite authors, I have all of his books and always look for his next book to come out.  I highly recommend him .
0451418441|5.0|A major work but a definite page turner.  A complex twisting and turning of events, many characters which are masterfully intertwined but so well written one feels they are part of the life style.  It helps to have read Pillars of the Earth previously to have a clear picture of the events preceding this volume.  I enjoyed both immensely!

B007FEFLTO|5.0|I read The Fall of Giants before Winter of the World to familiarize myself with the characters.  I was captivated by the characters and how they interacted throughout this book.  I especially liked the accurate details of the battles and the espionage involved.  I've read quite a few novels on WW2 but this account gave a distinctively different view of the American, English, Russian and German aspect.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and didn't want it to end.  I look forward to the third book of the series.

B0044C3RB4|5.0|Season 3 is great.  The series is relentless and never lets up.  They love to pluck at emotional strings and for sure did so quite often during the season.  If you have gotten to this point, you are a fan and will absolutely enjoy the season.  If you haven't seen the show yet, for sure start at season 1 and get into the whole thing!

0618001905|5.0|It is books like these that I read and marvel at the depth of archival digging it must have taken to explain the history.  Again, I am impressed at the method of presentation to how the book arrests the reader's attention down to the last page.  Should I be skeptical of potential sensationalism when an historical account has the ability to be so vivid, grabbing and interesting?  I could just chalk it up to my own deep love and interest of sub-saharan Africa.<br /><br />\\"Leopold's Ghost\\" begins by painting a picture of the context of events.  Those events include the exciting explorations of Henry Mortan Stanley, his encounter with Dr. Livingston, Stanley's commission by the King of Belgium and the competitive scramble for Africa.  The author also sets the stage through a psychological stab at King Leopold's own obession with money and geography coupled with a thirst for power that led him to seek out a tract of land to possess and rule beyond his humble Belgium.<br /><br />Colonialism as a franchise was wrapped in many euphymisms to include ventures of \\"protectionism\\", \\"science\\" or \\"philanthropy\\".  Where many historians take a critical look at missionary activity in places like Africa, this author's opinion is more favorable.  Indeed, any respectable cause is easy prey to those who might use its benefits only as a mask for nefarious activity.  Colonial powers, traders and even to the extend of corrupted clerics marched into Africa under the banner of \\"civilizing missions\\" only to send home their loot of ivory or other raw materials.<br /><br />As early as 1500 A.D. the native King of Congo, Affonso I, himself a convert to Christianity, rebuked the king of Portugual for allowing the corruption of his colonial hands to represent the same evil that took Jesus to the cross (pg. 14).  Interesting that Affonso maintained his faith in Jesus despite the corrupted wretched vehicle through which it came to him.  Four hundred years later it was the missionaries who continued their scathing criticisms of Leopold's raping of Congo (pg. 125).<br /><br />\\"Leopold's Ghost\\" describes the context of Congo's debates in perhaps a much more inflated picture of importance than reality.  the author weaves into the Congo debates of 1900 - 1910 whole underground conspiracies within U.S. congress, weaving also connections between such high profile personalites as J. P. Morgan, Author Conan Doyle, Mark Twain, the Rockafellors and others whether directly or indirectly.  Perhaps the sad truth is that Congo did recieve wide publicity, albeit negative, while other colonies received barely a mention or two of their own atrocities committed within them.<br /><br />In 1908, under pressure from all sides, King Leopold transfered his personal Congo enterprise to the Belgium government including the 110 million francs of debt it had acquired.  In all, supposedly King Leopald had amassed a wealth of over $1.1 Billion from Congo's resources, to include rubber and ivory, but it was all spent on his mistress, his own flaboyant lifestyle or any of a number of public monuments and useless eye candy of no benefit to Belgium or Congo's infrastructure.<br /><br />But what's more, the failing of Europe during the Congo atrocities was merely another example in the tension between interests and ethics.  As one German news put it \\"It's certainly not easy... to arrive at a clear opinion in questions where so many interests are at stake...(pg. 240)\\".  World powers were hasty or inhibited to place a moral stance on the Congo issue due to national interests.  National interests and alliances motivate the ethical verdict or lack thereof.<br /><br />The one criticism I would place on the book is perhaps how the author has misdirected the haunting of Leopold's ghost.  There is small mention in the last chapter of how Congo's present crisis is a reflection of its colonial plight.  The haunting that the author stresses instead is directed towards Europe and Europeans.  Instead of tracing the lives of Congolese, the author follows the lives of Leopold's strongest critics, the fate of world leaders and the price of whistle-blowing.  For whom is the ghost a haunt: the abolitionist or the land that lost 10 million?ing the lives of Congolese, the author follows the lives of Leopold's strongest critics, the fate of world leaders and the price of whistle-blowing.  For whom is the ghost a haunt: the abolitionist or the land that lost 10 million?
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|When I couldn't find the book for my granddaughter in the store or the library.  I decided to go to Amazon and get the whole series and I won't have to hunt for them.  I made my granddaughter happy.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is great if you're having a lull in your sex life. Or if you want to get ideas. Best part is, if you take your time, you can really extend the sexy times. There are dozens of sex scenes in this book and for some reason women are REALLY turned on by it. It's funny because my girlfriend always got really horny for me even though she was reading about Grey.<br /><br />Girls need mental stimulation to get turned on, unlike men who just need physical stimulation, and this book is perfect for getting their &#34;brain&#34; in the mood.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|I haven't read any of the series but according to my granddaughter it is really funny and makes good books to do book reports on.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|I like Denzel Washington. Most of his movies are pretty good and this is no exception. A good story, with a bit of a far fetched save of a crashing plane, but the emphasis of the story is much more on the problems of the pilot himself and that makes this a good movie.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|Bought the whole series for my granddaghter.  She didn't have to go to the library to try and get them to do a book report  on.

B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I had mixed feelings about reading this book from other reviews posted.  But, I'm glad I decided to read it and come to my own conclusion of like or dislike.  I actually like it and would recommend it to others. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This show is a great version of Sherlock Holmes. Johnny Lee Miller plays Holmes in a way that's frustrating and lovable all at the same time. Lui is a great Watson. I hope this show is on for a long time. My husband and I truly enjoy watching.
B00BESM14U|3.0|You really feel a strong connection to the characters. It's emotional up and down. I would recommend it.  Great acting
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Me and my daughter are hooked. It is all the fun of a pet without the stinky stuff.<br />You will not be able to put it down. She loves dressing her horse with all the different outfits they have. We both love the holiday ones.
B001I0T92Q|5.0|It worked how it was supposed to.  It worked great when I used to use my PSP, however I don't use it anymore, still a good product anyway!
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|it was not entertaining.  the best thing was the actual flight then it was just Denzel doing drugs and drinking.  terrible movie.  DID NOT WATCH THE END.  JUST TURNED IT OFF.
B006UKC566|5.0|Watching 3D &#34;The Clash of the Titans&#34; and &#34;Wrath of the Titans&#34; was Great.  But &#34;Immortals&#34; kicked both their butts!  Outstanding!
B007JNWQZS|5.0|If you enjoyed Kill Bill, you will love the Blu-ray version. The scenery is breath-taking, and the fights even more realistic.
0374533571|5.0|This was a quick and easy read.  I liked it.  I would recommend it to anyone that likes love stories with drama.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|I really like angry birds but this app has way to many pop up ads to enjoy. I'm going to delete this app right away.
B0000041JU|2.0|I anxiously awaited this recording, which arrived in a timely manner. It was packaged as any new cd sold in the USA usually is. When I took off the wrapping and removed the cd for the first time the top side was covered with fingerprints. I was disgusted.
B001BKTEZA|4.0|I was the Movie years ago.  Being born in the 1930's and listening to my grandparents telling there stories about the depression it would be a good read.<br /><br />Justin
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I purchased this for my 15 yr old and he loves it.  His friends also find this a challenge as well.  They enjoy challenging one another to see how far each can go on a single turn.  Works well.
B007STXHTM|5.0|I bought the GoPro Dive housing for my husband for his birthday.  When we went snorkeling, I took my underwater Pentax, which I loved, and we took photos side-by-side.  His were WAY better than mine.  I was shocked at how far GoPro  has come with their technology.  This works great with the GoPole, which I also have.
1454901276|5.0|The book showed a wonderful, detailed story of life on the Lewis Islands off the coast of England, creating the scenery, the mood, and the people living there. The reader is compelled to turn the pages because of the unique scene presented, as well as the mystery.
B00338QENI|5.0|I bought this after hearing an interview on NPR with Ms. Skloot.  While I was reading the book, I felt like my eyes couldn't take in the words fast enough.  Enlightening as much as it is enraging, Ms. Skloot handles an amazingly complex topic and distills it into a narrative that is engaging and educational.  I highly recommend this book.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|it was neat since you have two worlds to explore, but like most of these types of games it is very linear. the graphics are surprizingly very good.
B000W93CHC|5.0|love historical novels.  Ken Follett 's writing always interesting and accurate.  Can't wait for more.Love his sagas. interesting from start to finish.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|JUST THAT PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT OTHERS SEX HABITS THE WRITING IS SO BAD AND BORING  I JUST SKIPPED  MOST OF IT AND DIDNT THINK THE SEX WAS WRITTEN WELL AT ALL<br />I AM SO PLEASED I DOWN LOADED AT A REASONABLE PRICE ON MY KINDLE
B00BL5EQLC|3.0|It's a nice game, but it's not the greatest of these games. I got it while free, if you had to pay for it, I'd rather play Wind Up knight. It's free and not doing in game purchases make it challenging. This is just simple $0.99 worth game.  Unless you love steam punk, buy something else.
B005UWGRIC|4.0|....and you have to give them props for that...add Robbie to the mix and you will DEFINITELY be entertained! A must-have for all Thatters around the planet!
B008MJC6ZS|5.0|great album will be buying more of testaments albums, albums have not changed since the beginning, keep them coming thanks
B0049MJEHA|4.0|Even though I'm happy with just the four of them, I'm really glad that Robbie reunited with them beause it wasn't the same (for better or for worse) without him.
B001NLCBJI|5.0|If you're in search of an action movie, you might want to skip this one. The film centers on two intelligent and introspective people who happen on one another whilst at a cross-roads in their respective lives. They become fast friends as they find solace and respite in the company of one another. This is a peaceful and thought-provoking film - one that I watch as one might enjoy a dish of comfort food. I've been a fan of Bill Murray's work for many years. I'll be looking for more films directed by Sofia Coppola in future.
B0000549B0|5.0|Showed this to my 11 and 12 year old kids who hate black and white movies, and they were mesmerized.  It's the whole question of what is reality vs. imagination, what is one person's reality vs. another, and at the end of the day, that family is the most important thing.  And jimmy Stewart was great.  I would have also liked to see the Jim Parsons version.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Really love the detail of the book!  I'm looking forward to reading more of George R.R. Martin over the summer sitting on the beach !
B008645YEE|5.0|Great
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Truly amazing.  You will be riveted.  This maybe the best book in the series.  This is fantasy writing at its best.
B000L212HW|5.0|I have never understood why this movie didn't have a bigger audience back in '03?!  This movie has some fantastic, photo-realistic CGI, terrific actors and a great story. Yeah, it ain't perfect but who cares, this isn't supposed to be rocket science. Rob Bowman (of X-Files fame) directed this affair and you can see his signatures all over the movie. Very well done -if you like monster movies, this is a good one to start with. I highly recommend to those who have the ability to appreciate it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Absolutely love this game! I can play it for hours at a time. Very fun and very addictive! Would recommend everyone to get this game. Download it now people . I think I will try Brave next. That looks fun as well.
B001KVZ6LQ|5.0|Okay, here we have the most well known, grandfather of all monster/special effects movies! Filmed waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay back in 1932 and released in 1933 (for you kiddies -it was a loooooooooonng time ago, back when the settlers were still crossing America). Any who -what is there not to say about how good this movie is? Nothing.<br /><br />Yeah, the acting is a bit &#34;1930's&#34; style (the affected-ness) and it's a bit shorter than I'd want but considering this movie was released only a few scant years after sound was introduced INTO movies -it's an amazing movie. The effects are spectacular, stunning -in 80 years since its release these effects would be like the most stunning, photo-realistic CGI of today. Special effects on film were brand new -most everything was done &#34;in-camera&#34; and the mere fact that they mixed miniatures and live action to great effect.<br /><br />Look: for those of you born after 1990/1995 -you're gonna see this and be like &#34;ugh! -stupid!&#34; -anyone else; you'll be able appreciate the work, that went into this. This movie SPAWNED all subsequent monster movies -including the Godzilla/Gojira movies.<br /><br />The 2005 Peter Jackson remake is a fantastic homage to this movie (and holds some excellent special effects) but this is the movie that really got the ball rolling after &#34;The Lost World&#34; came out in the 1920's. This is the movie that all modern day monster movies lives up to. Highly. Recommended.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|Slow reading but quick ending...not sure about whether to love  it or to admit it was just ok!<br />Did anything happen to Logan?
B005NPCUC8|4.0|Okay, I know: it's almost considered near &#34;blasphemy&#34; to not like Pink Floyd or &#34;TDSoTM&#34; or &#34;The Wall&#34; -and I don't dislike Floyd, just not a big fan. &#34;TDSoTM&#34; is a classic rock album from 1973 -most fans (especially if you're old enough to remember its original release) are rabid about this album. I bought it simply because they priced it right -honestly. I have nothing against the band, this album just isn't the hard rock spectacle that other bands released in the 70's. I can appreciate the music, the time it took to record and the efforts. I recommend the physical vinyl copy to those rabid Floyd fans -I simply downloaded it from Amazon.
B00BL5EQLC|4.0|The anti-hero protagonist - a Steampunk Parkour runner - is tasked with delivering a suspicious package to a man.  There is no timer, no life, no save, and no scores in the mission-based levels; if you've ever played \\"Hitman\\", then you know that any single mistake and you are starting the level over.  And while you can pause, you cannot stop your character from running dangerously right from the start of each level.  I only played Temple Run a few times, but if you were to put Temple Run in a sideways scroller, then you'd get an idea of how this game operates.<br /><br />Along the way, try to collect up to three silver bars (there are three in each level).  If you collect enough silver bars in the levels, you will unlock the Survival mode, but you don't have to do all of them in the first section.  Survival Mode is where the scores come in, and there is an internet scoreboard (which I prevented from loading).  There seems to be two sections, each with 15 levels, which means that the game is a bit short.  At least it only measures from 18MB as a download.<br /><br />Also, don't even think about skipping levels.  Just as you must finish each level successfully without error, you also must finish each level before going on to the next level.  Same goes for each section - you must finish all levels in one section before moving on to the next section.<br /><br />The controls work very well, with only a little inconsistency, on my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1.  Keep in mind that multi-touch interferes with the game, so keep those stray fingers and other body parts away from the screen.<br /><br />The music is okay, and the sound effects a tad annoying and creepy.  I think I'd like to have my own music in the background on this one.<br /><br />The 3-D graphics are pretty good.  You don't really notice it, which is actually a good thing, because it is done so well.<br /><br />Another reviewer commented that there are no instructions in the game.  This is true, partially.  When you first start, there's nothing telling you that you need to touch the white, pulsing orb with the city-shape in it.  When you do start playing, however, the game nicely tutors you in the operation of the game.  These tutorials occur frequently throughout the first section, so you really won't get lost so easily.<br /><br />I like that there is no IAP, no nags, no rating requests or requirements, or anything else other than internet access and access to your phone state and identity.<br /><br />In all, it is well done, if not a tad bit frustrating at times.you first start, there's nothing telling you that you need to touch the white, pulsing orb with the city-shape in it.

B00BL5EQLC|5.0|from what i can see (from reviews) its very fun.... buuut the controls may not always work... but it still seems like a nice game
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is the best game I have ever played!&iexcl;!&iexcl;! it needs some more updates though.:~] does not have enoufe mobs
B007ZRZF8I|3.0|i hear its a great game but why would you have to spend more money to finish the game? plus openfeint? why is that not told to us or even needed.... it should be optional and told in the description of the game
B000UJ48WC|5.0|It's amazing how an old school movie - in this day and age - can still trump the nerves.  Not just a high-grade classic in its own right, but practically the “go to” option when all other plans fail.  This is the “necessary evil” for all horror and suspense fans to keep handy when the weather gets bad, or cable programming is terrible, or when you’re just plain bored and feel like delivery food and a blanket.  Whether you’re alone, on a first date or old and soul mated, THE SHINING will never fail to entertain and - in its own strange and twisted sort of way – leave you comforted in the confines of home sweet home.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I loved this book! I took a break from Nicholas Sparks after Dear John, but I was thoroughly pleased when I decided to read him again!
B009O2XY12|4.0|This is a fun game to play and it doesn't require a lot of concentration so you can play and enjoy it with out stress.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Nicholas Sparks always writes books that are easy to read and allow me to escape for a little bit. Sometimes all I need is a brief escape.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|sometimes the plot seems cheesy, and little over the top, and yet some of those seem to be when the emotional plug hits the hardest! I have enjoyed this series much more than expected; however, I think you really have to be invested in the series and understand what has happened in previous episodes to really understand and get the impact of some of the shows. The one thing I dont like is in the back of my mind wondering when the next major character change is coming! I like David Tennant's portrayal of Dr. Who and hate to see him go, but I said that about the last Dr. Who as well:-) Still not keen on Donna, played by Catherinne Tate - I don't think it is her acting as much as just the character...although if they were trying to get separation between the two characters sexually, they definitely succeeded!
B0054R6BFM|5.0|All teenagers should read this. We never know how the smallest action can affect someone. We all need to stop and think about what we are doing.
B005C0DHEY|4.0|An in-depth look at natural gas pipelines and the devastation caused by the use of fracking. Very informative with good use of photography.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|My nephews love the game. I am disappointed with the added violence of the &#34;monkey&#34; catching the runner and shaking etc. That was not a needed addition.
B00846REIS|5.0|What a great book! Can't wait to see what happens next. Hope this story gets turned into a movie soon.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This is a lovely set of tiles in a variety of tableaux. Some might not want the program to shuffle automatically when all possible moves are  gone, but I do.
8478884955|5.0|Me encantó porque este libro es dificil de conseguir y aun mas en tapa dura, lo recibi nuevo de paquete para mi colección, perfecto!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is fun and really challenging.....I sometimes have to give up and come back later when I'm not so frustrated!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ok this is a great game. Here are some PROS and CONS.<br />PROS<br />1.it has lots of the monsters from the computer version<br />2.it has lots of options 4 the inventory<br />3.it is almost as addictive as the PC version<br /><br />CONS<br />1.needs buckets, fire, water, and lava<br />2.there aren't animals on creative mode<br />3.it isn't multiplayer<br /><br />Besides those cons it is a truly awesome game. I recommend this game for anybody that is 3-5 or older. Totally worth $7.00!!! ENJOY THIS GAME!!!!! :3
B009KEN87O|5.0|this is an amazing game. I am always on this when I am bored, and I never get tired. this is better than Temple Run!! I got this game on sale for free, but I promise that if u were addicted to Temple Run at any time, this is really worth your money.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Its great but with me nobody can connect to me,  but I can connect to them.:-(<br />Also I love creative mode because I get everything all ready.
B005KAH7QU|5.0|It's a marathon fun tournament watching this kick-butt little girl take out one male opponent after another. You wonder how she is so capable, and that's the beauty of this nearly flawless script. We learn a little at a time who she really is, and her origins. The soundtrack is a little funky for some, but Hanna is a bizarre little girl raised in the tundra without benefit of modern conveniences (like electricity), but given the benefit of a super-charged education, fighting, and survival skills. She's short on social skills, which provides us with the needed humorous interludes between the intense action scenes. At one point she's asked by the mother of a family she kicks around with for a time, &#34;What did your die from?&#34; &#34;Three bullets,&#34; Hanna answers. Hanna is a good blend of the required non-stop adventures of an action thriller with a treatise on social bonding between individuals (Hanna and the little girl from the family).
B0076DCT2G|1.0|I have read every one of Nelson DeMille's books. I'm tired of the John Corey character. He has become boring. This is my last DeMille read with the John Corey character.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Awesome game very addictive. Keeps u wanting to play it. Very good graphics. Hope they come out with HD version for kindle.
B006MW3VGA|1.0|Great show, but the Amazon streaming video service is not reliable. I tried to watch the show now and it's unavailable, as is every other title in Amazon streaming video at the moment. My internet connection is fine so it's definitely an Amazon problem. Amazon, please work on the reliability of this service. I will think twice before any future purchases of streaming video.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|God is wonderful! The movie is a wonderful expression of the power, grander, and love of God! I loved it and can wait to buy it!
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|Good CD of the music from this great series. However this CD is light. It could and should have included more songs from the show. The volume 1 on the label is probably a clue the company will try to milk you into buying several volumes that clock in on a light running time. They should have waited until the season was over and then put out one disc for all of season 1. Hope there's going to be a season 2.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The  acting is excellent, the filming perfect, and the story and setting as well.  However, other shows and movies can say the same.  What makes this one stand apart for me is that--for once in our current, debased society--we find (here) a shining example of staid honour in the midst of life's swirling moral tumults and challenges.  While the period reflects certain hypocrisies and less-than-ideal perspectives on class, still the dignity and propriety with which the genteel conducted themselves then is to be admired.  The series does an exemplary job of presenting both, not shying from the reality of personal mistakes and blemishes that follow humanity in every time and venue, yet capitalizing on the high presiding moral character and ethical standards that we have long since forgotten in our time.  Few examples of quality entertainment today achieve this.  Typically they reflect the coarse, ignoble, and &#34;improprietous&#34; behavior of the present day; if they do manage to produce a piece of high moral caliber any more, it is often sadly lacking in all other aspects of its production.<br /><br />Without attempting to write a character sketch on each of the cast, I will make a very brief statement of my favorite character--that of John Bates, as performed Brendan Coyle (who played a similarly admirable role in Larkrise to Candleford, which wonderful series was unfortunately abbreviated and never finished).  Although Robert Crawley (performed by Hugh Bonneville) as the generally respectable head man of the Crawley family plays a central star role and is thus a predominant figure in the story, I feel that the overshadowed John Bates is the true and honourable hero.<br /><br />In particular If you appreciate period pieces, especially British, then try this series out; of all the British-genre I've seen, series or individual movies, this is my favorite.  If I was compelled at gunpoint to make mention of some negative generality, I suppose I might say (thought barely) that while there is plenty of enjoyable British witticism throughout, it may (or may not) be quite as replete with classic quotables as in certain other individual pieces of the same genre (i.e. Sense & Sensibility), and that is difficult to compare in any case, as the one is a movie and the other a TV series.
B007REV4YI|5.0|One of the best Bond films in a long time. Instead of absurd stories with many special effects this movie harkens back to the older films that made us fans to begin with. Daniel Craig has been a great choice to play the Bond character.

B0013O123Q|1.0|I think that whatever the point was in the production of this film, it amounts to nothing more than trash.  Who needs to see such coarseness as displayed with the central act of the abusive rape.  What is the point?  Whatever.
B00947N6D8|5.0|My almost 6 year old loves this movie more than any other we've watched together, and I have to say that my husband and I do too.  It's got engaging characters, excellent voice acting, a compelling story, lots of side humor, a good message and it's really visually stunning.  I'm so often just bored or annoyed by children's films.  For this one we were as engaged as our son.  Our family highly recommends this film!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie is so funny...so many great lines! Singing is awesome as well. This movie is fun and definitely worth seeing.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Old school fans will love this!  Great memories of Mario revived with this one!  Endless hours of great retro fun!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|At first I thought this book would be geared more toward kids, but if you look alittle deeper it will keep even the most hard core adult readers interested.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Old school fans will love this!  Great memories of Mario revived with this one!  Endless hours of great retro fun!
B003DXSXCI|5.0|Bullitt and Mcqueen Good classic movie! Great to see again and again. I hope this helps however, nothing else to say.
B00005N6KG|5.0|My wife uses these at the gym.  I ordered two sets just to have a backup.  Forget paying $50 for headphones.  Buy these excellent quality headphones instead.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|First time I had played this game it was awesome but when I was on Level 21 the game crashed. So I had to delete it. in order to fix it.  Second time it had happened I updated it and it crashed again!!!!!!! You know Backflip studios you are so lucky that the update is free because if it wasn't I would have even put a one star rating of this game!!!!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|its like several authors wrote it each have their own voice. 😃 😃 😃 😃 😃 😃 😃🎊 🎉 🎉
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a nice app with good graphics and a large array of things to do, and my little brother loves it!
B0034DGPEU|3.0|I really enjoyed this book until the end which left me wanting it to come together a little in a more satisfying manner. Hope that isn't a spoiler, it shouldn't be.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love the production, the story and I love watching the HD version on my IPAD with a headset. Picture and sound are just perfect.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is a good version Mahjong with all the features I expected.  Looks great on Kindle Fire.  Nice variety of layouts and levels of difficulty.
B0037NVM2C|5.0|One of the best science fiction films ever made. Still thrilling and awesome a couple of decades later. Best nuke scene of any movie, too.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|ireally liked this ho game it held my interest and ihave all ready played. it several. times looking to the sequel
B000PC0U1W|1.0|The DVD does not work just a blank screen.  Was extremely disappointed as I live this movie was so looking forward to seeing it in Blu-ray.
B0089XH38M|5.0|I did like this app until I found that it can read my text messages. After researching, I see that most antivirus apps do that but I'm sorry, to me that's just a tad bit too much of an invasion! For the time that I did use it though, it was good to have. Does anyone know of any antivirus apps that do NOT need access to your text messages?
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this game!!!  I play it every chance I get. If I wouldn't run out of coins so fast, it would be better.
140053271X|5.0|Because the Nook Simple Touch runs Android (albeit with most signs of it covered up), it can be rooted to allow the installation of Android apps. Opera Mobile allows for web browsing; various RSS readers make keeping up with the news a cinch; Mango provides more manga than I can ever hope to read; you can even install Amazon's Kindle app for Android! There are limitations, of course. Rooting the Nook (via Nooter), while not difficult, does require some level of computer know-how. The Simple Touch does not have any sort of audio output, and the e-ink screen can't handle video.  Still, having near-instant access to news, weather, email, books, comics, and most websites makes the Nook Simple Touch a great little device, especially if you can find one used.
B001GMQALY|5.0|this is one of the best movies ever. it put kim bassinger on the map and shot mickey rourke into a hotter level. this movie gave enough just to let our minds take over. a great movie. i love mickey rourke and if you had more stars to rate with i would have given it a higher rating.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Started reading this series on a recommendation from a friend who is also into high fantasy. If you like Tolkien but wish it had more sex, shadier characters, and above all more political intrigue, this is the series for you. Rally convenient to have the first four all in one package.
B005KELW26|5.0|I bought this for my son's kindle, purple is his favorite color. It protects the device & keeps it clean. I would reccomend.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This is another app that does just what it is meant to do.  Gets you to Facebook and lets you do what you want to do.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|The show is amazing I enjoy watching it. It always pulls my heart strings. Sometimes it gets so sad that I stop watching it, but then I always come back because there is always a silver lining, Definitely worth paying for it and watching it.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|This movie was all around good. It had a great balance of humor, drama, and suspense.. Enjoyed watching this movie.
B0091REZMW|3.0|its an ok game but its just a little slow pace for me. still a good time waister if you need it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I like coin dozer so much because it is soooo fun! You get prizes and other stuff. and you play other games! Get more Gamecircus games! It's free! Get it now!
B0015DROBO|5.0|Lots of action, scandal and a fabulous, so not-run-of-the-mill heroine.  It's a shame that Larsson passed so soon.  I would have devoured anything else he would write.
030758836X|4.0|Great book that captured my attention early on, and heightened it through the middle pages.  Ending was a bit of a let down, as if the author thought of every detail about these characters except how to properly end their journey together.  Very much worth the time, though.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Stories are very very good! We are watching season one and will watch them all. Very good drama and acting
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I wanted to read this because I heard it was well written and also because I heard it was helping to put nails in the coffin of the traditional publishing industry.  That second part may or may not be true, but the first part absolutely is true.  I enjoyed the book and look forward threading more from the author.<br /><br />Can't wait to see a movie based on Wool.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I think this game is good but when my dad's sisters daughter wanted to play she wanted a pool but I couldn't make one my suggestion would be that the creators put a bucket in the game like the on for computer.
B00631HASU|5.0|Same concept as zuma nice pictures very fun would recommend this game to friends.well worth the cost to play not a waste.
B0015DYIH2|1.0|Reading this book was torture. I had to force myself to finish this book. When I read the first one, I decided to try the next two books to see if anything interesting was going to happen. It didn't. Then I read the fourth book. Just when I thought twilight couldn't get any worse, Stephanie Meyer published this piece of crap.<br />**SPOLIERS**<br />So it starts off right in the beginning with Bella and Edward getting married. I don't even know what the dress looks like and I also have no clue as to what the wedding looks like. Oh wait.... Meyer did tell me that the dress was silk.. I know sooooo much detail.<br />Next they go on their honeymoon. Bella begs Edward to have sex. Ugh. When she wakes up she is covered in bruises. Then she begs to do it again. She is insane (as proven in the second book). And then Bella gets PREGNANT!!!!!! What the heck. Meyer told us that \\"vampires\\" have NO BODILY FLUIDS.... THAT MEANS BELLA CANNOT GET PREGNANT WITH EDWARD.<br />Ok. So they have left and all of a sudden Bella has motherly feelings for this thing that is KILLING HER (more proof she is insane). Edward even offers that she go get pregnant with Jacob. I think it is disturbing that her HUSBAND would ask her to go have sex with ANOTHER GUY.<br />I don't even want to go into the birth. It is downright disgusting. It didn't make me want to vomit though. Meyer needs to stop with the romance and write horror if she can come up with this scene. Bella commits blood. The baby is ripped out of her uterus. And the baby's name is................................Renesmee. that is the most hideous name I have ever heard.<br /><br />Then Bella gets turned into a vampire and she \\"learns\\" to control her thirst. You know how Meyer states it takes a long time to control the thirst. Bella conquers that urge in 30 minutes. Wow. I wanted her to be the only real vampire, kill every one in the story, then have the volturi kill her. Then we can all feel a little better at the end of the book, but no, of course not.<br />Then we learn Jacob imprinted on Bella' s daughter. Great. So now we have two petofiles. Jacob and Edward. Jacob imprints on a 1 day old child. Edward , a one hundred and however old man, married an eighteen year old girl.<br /><br />Next, some random people come over as witnesses for when the voltouri come and one of them shows Bella how to use her shield.<br /><br />Then the \\"epic battle\\" comes. The voltouri come over and talk and walk away. So epic right?<br /><br />Next things cool down in like two pages and it ends.<br /><br />It was a horrid story with no climax. You will want to chuck it at a wall if you read it even if you are a major twilight fan. If you must read it, check it out at the library. Do not buy it because I am regretting buying it. I should have spent my money on something else.of course not.<br />Then we learn Jacob imprinted on Bella' s daughter. Great. So now we have two petofiles. Jacob and Edward.

B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Yup. Coming from the creator of Family Guy and American Dad, this is pretty much a movie with the same kind of humor, except racier.  Ted was a loveable character and his somewhat irresponsible way of living makes for some good laughs. My only question was why the last few minutes of the movie needed to take a somewhat dark turn but, overall, it was a fun movie.
B009OA57MI|5.0|It is one of the funniest games that I've ever played. Although they should have more air craft in the game ,and when you create your own levels you should be able to put you own aircraft in the air like commercial airliners and other aircraft.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|THANK YOU MR. SPIELBERG FOR NOT ALTERING HISTORY FOR THEATER VALUE; THE MOVIE WAS EXCEPTIONAL. I WILL BE PURCHASING THE MOVIE TO SHOW MY KIDS AND GRANDKIDS.
B00466HM28|5.0|This lil keyboard is just great. For such a small lil guy it hits every octave and fits 8 parameter controllers and on top of that 8 pads with two channels. Well you could read all that in the description but I have to say this is great for the price
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|So much easier to use &amp; see than my cell. Like the save function. This is a great app for older adults.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|just as we remember it when first distributed in theaters and later on tv, so happy we could add it to our collection
140591243X|5.0|vary good book highly recommand it .bought book for wife to read and she read book in 2 days  thanks
B002JJ88HC|5.0|I'm not a follower of the author, Mr. Pullman, although \\"His Dark Materials: The Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife\\", and, \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" are among the best fantasy series I've read. His, Mr. Pullman, is an incredibly rich imagination and the story of Lyra, the protagonist, and her adventures through parallel universes flow smoothly from each book to the next. All the characters seem to come alive and Lyra and her friends are endearing to the point that one might wish being part of the adventure.<br /><br />Like the \\"Harry Potter\\" series there's much magic throughout the story. But that's where similarities end; there's an intermingling of science and pseudo religion within this fiction, undoutedly why some circles frown upon the trilogy. There are witches and daemons too (not demons), and an assortment of invented friends and foe. Mr. Pullman's invented history borrows a bit from our own but then twists and turns it into wonderous imaginings and inventions of his own making.<br /><br />Some compare this story with that of the \\"Rings\\" trilogy by \\"Tolkien\\", but, I think it's closer to \\"Carroll's\\" \\"Alice\\". However, it's definitely as grand as either but very unlike both. It's superb writing and story telling. I'll read it again and again.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|It's a really fun app with lots of dinosaurs to ceep you busy . I know it will take It will take everything off your mind.
0525478817|5.0|A touching, in-your-face story about young people who have cancer and courageously carry on living their lives. Hazel, Augustus and Isaac cope w horrendous treatments, stare death in the face and contemplate the meaning of their lives... All the while cracking up readers with their humor, wit and sharing their teenage angst. A well written story, great character development, and lots of twists and turns just like life. I'm looking forward to the movie.
0307744434|5.0|I loved Erin Morgensten's writing style.  She is one of the few writers who makes me really feel like I am in the story, Smelling,  touching, tasting, seeing what the characters are experiencing.  The story is magical and just like the circus where there are rings of acts, some overlapping, some on their own, but all belonging to the story... So the characters overlap, shine on their own, and fit together.  I loved each page of this book.
B00A7OIXW6|3.0|It is OK but I was disappointed.  Perhaps all the glowing reviews had set me up for that. But the truth is, if you are not into video games it's no better than ho-hum.
B00AEFYCL4|4.0|I don't normally write reviews, but was compelled in this case to give a few thoughts about it as I felt it was a touching and moving true story.  This is a movie that is painted as a coming of age, finding yourself type story, but the real lesson is about forgiveness and relationship.  The protagonist learns the lesson of forgiveness the hard way, realizing that he can't live life on his own, or be happy without the shared experience of relationship, and that relationship is impossible without forgiveness.  The way the movie expresses this lesson as the point of the protagonist's journey is really well done and compelling.  Anyone can find themself in the midst of his arduous journey, realizing his driven-ness and ambition to go to alaska are really just a search for reconciliation, and understanding of his parents failings in their family.  This is a hard-won, true story that sean penn conveys well, but could have done in about half the time without losing anything.  The bits of being \\"too long\\" are a lot of artistic camera fodder and nature footage which are all nice, but don't add much.  Other than that, though, the movie keeps you locked in because of the character's development and how his journey impacts the people he's with.  The man playing the main character captures the essence of this very well, fitting quite naturally into the hippy kind of mindset, or what he calls a \\"supertramp.\\"  All in all, an unexpected good movie, despite the length.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Set in a retirement home for musicians, QUARTET tells the story of a group of people, each with their own story to tell, who learn how to live with one another and grow old gracefully.  Billy Connolly's Wilf is an incorrigible flirt, with a penchant for finding alcohol stashed away in a greenhouse.  Tom Courtenay's Reggie, a retired opera singer, tries to come to terms with his past; especially when he encounters his ex-wife Jean (Maggie Smith), a proud operatic diva forced to live at the home because she has no money.  The two of them begin by not speaking to each other, but their relationship softens in the end.  For me Pauline Collins' standout performance as Cissie is the film's most memorable aspect; her portrayal of a woman suffering from Alzheimer's is both funny and poignant.  The supporting cast is just wonderful: I loved David Ryall and Trevor Peacock impersonating Flanagan and Allen, while Michael Gambon blusters and preens as a conceited director.  Beautifully photographed in autumnal colors - matching the mood of the piece - QUARTET quite literally left me with tears of joy in my eyes, and that rarely happens.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|Yeah! this is what I call an great concert but I might be biased, I like outstanding performances with especially good video and sound. This is much better than most concerts by the long in the tooth performers. My only nitpick is that Don Henley's voice wasn't loud enough when he was singing from behind the drums. This came by mail yesterday and Amazon got it to me sooner than I expected, so I had a good evening.
1451696191|5.0|Okay, adolescent fiction rules!  Especially when you read it as the parent of one. This book will remind those frustrated parents of teens, BEING A TEENAGER IS COMPLICATED!!!! Perks might help you recall just how complicated. Don't just get mad; reach for some patience.  Parents have often buried the most agonizing memories from those high school years, because that's what we do. Wallowing in painful memories from your past is pathetic. But this book brings it all back with wonderful narration, characters and story-telling. I am not the demographic, but I can still access my teenage self.  There are lots of jerks in high school. LOTS of them.  Everyday there are smirks of one kind or another. But the perks? Oh those perks.  Things mattered then. Small things, big things. They are all HUGE in the eyes of an adolescent.  And then you grow up. Now I wish more things were still HUGE! I miss the drama, and this book brings it all back ( in a more contemporary setting!).  Read it.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|So after installing this app I think it's pretty good.  It shows a myriad of breakdowns of the ins and outs of your battery, but a lot of it seems to be useless information.  so maybe they are trying to over think things.  I don't like the fact that it automatically opens up after you charge your Kindle to show you the battery level.  It's obvious to me sometimes that I know that the level is at 100% after I charge it, for that is the reason I put it on the charger to begin with, to fully charge it.
B004HO6I2E|5.0|This was a great movie, and I did not have to worry about scratches on the DVD, the DVD looked brand new just as they said, packed well, no rips on the packaging, nbo cracks on the case, and the DVD had no scratches on it.
B008RNYNDM|5.0|It only has the movie on the DVD, which is fine by me since that's all I wanted anyways, but if there ever came a special edition for all regions I'd definitely jump on it since it is a hilariously crude and nude in all the best ways.~ c;
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|My husband loved this movie adn men do not always get into this type of movie, but he did..I would say this is just as much of a guy flick as a girl flick, the DVD was in excellent condition as well.
B008476HBM|5.0|One of the greatest novels ever written.  One I can read over and over.  Wonderful characters, deep and insightful social commentary. I would recommend to anyone.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is an amazing sequel to the original. With the addition of rope zip-lines and the constantly changing scenery (including the minecart area) , TR2 is a great game for long toad trips or even just the bus ride to school.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Everything you would want in a series Game of Thrones has it! Good to see HBO pulling through, if only they could have done the same with Rome.
1616550414|5.0|Amazing book to have for LoZ fans. Might actually be a must have.<br />+ for Hardcover and weight. Very durable.
B008HK3XYK|4.0|Holds the Fire firmly, I can choose where to it is placed horizontally. The front folds back nicely when holding vertically (not too bulky and I have small hands). I really like the elastic band to make sure it stays closed in my purse. The color is perfect!
1906735875|4.0|This book was my first exposure to the Judge Dredd stories from 2000 AD, no better place to start than the beginning, right?  I found the collection highly enjoyable.  The individual stories are only about six pages long with rotating creative teams throughout.  With most stories being so short (though there are a few that continue from one to the next)they are action packed!  Dredd is a great character: he is the law in the future Mega-City One! The artists were mostly unfamiliar to me (other than the great Brian Bolland of course) but I found them all quite pleasing to the eye with lots of interesting page and panel layouts.  My only complaint is probably the amount of time spent on Walter the Robot.  I don't mind comedy relief but speech impediment gags don't work very well on the written page, I just find them annoying and difficult to read.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|Frank Sinatra and Count Basie are simply the best. The only thing better would have been being there in person.
0739370693|5.0|The start of this book was really difficult for me to get past. The size of his ego is stunning, his very non-academic choice of wording is obnoxious, and it is hard to take him seriously as he bashes entire professions as being mostly useless.<br /><br />He then proceeded to make brilliant point after brilliant point. Few are likely to be truly original, but it is nothing short of remarkable how much wisdom he managed to fit into this little book. This really is one of the most important books of the last decade. If you are reading this review to decide whether to buy this book, stop thinking and just buy it.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|I just purchased the trilogy on blu ray today its in my player -im watching Empire right now-the picture is friggin amazing-the sound is fantastic-im not sure why this is getting 3 stars. Wide sreen -full screen -theatrical-extra this-extra that-who cares. If it makes all you whiners feel better I guess you can watch your scratchy-gritty-fluttery vHS versions but Iam in heaven enjoying Star Wars on bluRay. Extend that!!
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Graphics excellent and objectives are obvious but a challenge.  Good game.  Hard to build up those coins though.  You will enjoy this app.
B00AQNOCZ0|4.0|It's fun to see these films in Blu-ray. The effect is an almost 3D look to them. Funny to hear them talk about the &#34;philosopher's stone&#34; instead of sorcerer's. We love the movies.  Only complaint I have is that the case from the third DVD was broken so the disk is &#34;free&#34; inside it. I don't know if that happened in the shipping or what.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I gave it a five star because it's one of the best ever. I always look forward to the next level...I'm hooked. Lots of levels, lots of fun! :-)

Was looking for something like this, and a friend who is a psychologist recommended it. So glad. I think this book could change my life.

B0055MBQOM|4.0|Have used high end monitors with color calibration for years. Have now used the ColorMunki Display for three months and am very happy with the results with the ability to rebuild the profile quickly to the current ambient light as an added bonus.<br /><br />Set up is easy, but I suggest two first steps. 1) If applicable - check that you monitor's window profile is installed or else start by installing it in windows. 2) Download the latest software from xrite's home page.<br /><br />Using the software is easy and I have never needed to consult the manual. Maybe a little more intuitive for me because I am used to color calibration, but I am certain its a LOT easier than when I started calibrating with my first device.<br /><br />Was worried at first about the time it would take as this is one of the selling points for the more expensive Pro version. But its easily quick enough for anyone not counting the seconds.<br /><br />Results seem excellent. I double checked using alternative methods. Not science, but enough to make me comfortable that it does the job.<br /><br />The only limitation is that previous software allowed me to tweek more of my settings and check the individual results in the color spectrum - such as how true blue is my blue? This is not possible with the \\"Display\\" version, but probably something you need to get the Pro version to check. However, since the overall result seems excellent this is a minor issue for me. If photography was my living I would probably feel different as checking individual colors is an excellent way of checking if its time to get a new monitor.<br /><br />Even if I use very expensive monitors, I have stuck to the middle-of-the-road calibration devices, because they usually work very well and because my editing environment is not so stable that it makes any sense to eek out the last precision calibration (i.e. I sit by a desk that is lit partly by day light during day). Here the option to rebuild the current profile with a click of the mouse is a very welcome feature that I believe many semi-pro photographers etc. will benefit from.<br /><br />As someone else mentioned. This device does not change the limitations of your current monitor. This is really for people who use excellent monitors to begin with. Otherwise for the additional price you could get a GREAT monitor in stead of an el cheapo mainstream monitor. You can gain a lot of color fidelity if you are willing to upgrade your monitor. Spend wisely...ck of the mouse is a very welcome feature that I believe many semi-pro photographers etc. will benefit from.<br /><br />As someone else mentioned.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Each season just keeps getting better and better.  Kudos to Julian Fellows for some of the  most sympathetic, humorous and human writing ever.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I think this game should have a little bit longer game but it's fun only if there WAS MORE TIME TO BUILD THINGS YOU ARE STUPID WHO EVER MADE THIS APP !!!!!! :(
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I wanted to see this movie because I knew nothing of the story behind it.<br />I knew the hostages had been released, but the planning and courage that brought this about was brilliant.<br />My heart was pounding until the movie's end.

B0063GORYU|5.0|I enjoy playing games on my Kindle Fire.  This is a whole new technology for me.  I like playing solitaire.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my step-mother who had been wanting to watch the show.  She was hesitant to catch re-runs on tv starting in the middle, so I surprised her with the first season.  This season, more than the others, does take a warming up period.  But, that can be said for any new show.  Funny as all get out!  You won't be disappointed with Big Bang!
0525951652|2.0|This book is really not good. I understand it is part of a trilogy.  The characters are boring and not very compelling.  The history is not interesting to this history buff. The relationships are shallow. I'd rather watch Downton Abby!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is from someone who can't make a stick man look right, and have always been self-conscious of playing Pictionary and those types of games.  But not being able to draw well is what makes this game fun!  It's hilarious trying to figure out what's going on, and not just from me!
B004EPZ06Q|3.0|part one was funnier them this one but I still laugh hard in some part. Hope part 3 is better.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|There are some serious plot twists and turns in this season, as compared to other two, that's for sure.  I do have to say, this was the wittiest season yet.  Everyone was on their game, except Matthew.  Until the last episode, he was getting on my nerves.  Just a whiny baby.  Guess it's best he asked to leave the show, which is sad, because he was one of my favorites!<br />There just aren't enough GOOD things to say about this show, every season.  Seriously.  I remember when I started watching it, no one knew what the hell I was talking about...a British show?  Yeah, right.  Now everyone and their brother has watched and loved this show!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great games for entire family!  Amazing selection of games for FREE. There are easy games for children as well as difficult games for adults.
B001LM1456|3.0|I wouldn't go out and buy this movie, but it was fun to watch for the first time via streaming.  It wasn't as good as I was hoping, and we almost didn't finish it.  Takes till the end to get interesting, but this is just my opinion!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|good app sort of scary at first. get use to contollingshfark and it becomes easier - great graphics and ocean floor and fish - I am a little slow but I like the treasure adventure and the evolution of sharks available. try it you will like it.

B000065PUE|5.0|With rumors out (for years now) that maybe there's a new album on the way, and with some of the incredible solo work Black Francis has put out (for example, BlueFinger and Seven Fingers a few years ago, I know if the Pixies come again, they have the power to start a fire that will burn for another 20 years.  Sure it won't be the same, but music groups and styles change over time, and here's a group that has the talent to define the next trend in alternative music.<br /><br />When I first heard Dolittle, I couldn't help being turned off at first.  For the uninitiated, Francis' screams can turn a lot of people off.  But give the Pixies' music a chance and it will knock you down with its force.  Beginning with Debaser, the first track, Francis' hard lyrics evoke shocking images (\\"..slicing up eyeballs...), set against layers of guitars and Kim Deal's alluring back-up vocals and chorus.  The sound softens up for a break with the cool \\"Wave of Mutilation.\\"  The lyrics are often crazy, funny, as in \\"Dead,\\" which starts out, \\"You crazy babe, Bathsheba...I'm tired of living, Shebee, so gimeee, dead!\\"  \\"Here Comes Your Man\\" is a rollicking tune, more mainstream, almost like a Beatles song, and was the album's most popular single.  Really, nearly every song is quite original--including such great songs as Monkey Gone to Heaven, Mr. Grieves, Hey, No. 13, and the grand, loud-quiet-loud Gouge Away.  It's unlike anything that was out back in the time it came out, or even today.softens up for a break with the cool \\"Wave of Mutilation.\\"  The lyrics are often crazy, funny, as in \\"Dead,\\" which starts out, \\"You crazy babe, Bathsheba...I'm tired of living, Shebee, go gimeee, dead!\\"  \\"Here Comes Your Man\\" is a rollicking tune, more mainstream, almost like a Beatles song, and was the album's most popular single.

B009UKUGXC|5.0|Iv read it already and just wanted it on my Kindle. Im into these sorts of storys with maths. Great book.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|Easy to follow but have not lost much weight. On the five days that you can eat what you want you still have to eat pretty healthy or you will gain weight. I am going to continue to follow the diet for another month with healthier choices on off day and see what happens. I do hope it works because the diet is easy to follow.
B003VWDOK2|5.0|Havent read it yet... but looks interesting. I have a friend who's read it and said it was a great read.
B006YC74E8|1.0|I didn't like it that much because it didn't really do any thing to help me rp take pictures from my kindle
B0016Q2D5M|3.0|Well I really don't have anything to say about this movie. It was an okay film, the script was okay, the acting was okay, this movie was really just \\"meh\\" for me. I did laugh in some scenes, that were meant to be funny. A weird thing was that eventhough i did think the acting was okay, its werid, when they wanted you to feel emotion, you felt it, it's a little hard to explain. But I wouldn't watch this film a second time.
B003SPCYP8|5.0|I liked this movie because it has so many layers of messages regarding tolerance and respect for people and human dignity.  The humor was amusing, appropriate and well placed.  A must see movie.
B001NLL0RW|5.0|JR is a great historical writer, learn much! Everyone should read this book. & all the other books he wrote!
B004LWZWBU|5.0|I bought this movie for a friend as a gift because it is refreshing and funny.  I've already seen it countless times and it never gets old.  This movie has a stellar cast with Owen Wilson, Steve Martin, and Jack Black.  Diane Wiest, Anjelica Huston, and JoBeth Williams also have memorable roles and the movie includes other well known actors and actresses.  This is a great film to relax and watch if you enjoy beautiful scenery, light humor, and a positive message.  The many different species of birds are also a joy to watch including the \\"ruby-throated hummingbird\\" and \\"snowy owl.\\"  A Big recommendation for The Big Year.
B008XG1X18|5.0|PInterest is a fun and interesting app it is free and it lets you see other people's interest and let's other people see yours as well and it is fin seeing projects and fun things to do my fave part is the fact that they let you have 3 secret boards that no-one else can see but you I hope you enjoy this app as much as I do
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nice story line. typical Nicholas Sparks - brings to light a social issue that makes you think about other people's lives.  Highly recommended
B00594XOZU|4.0|This is a very pleasing app. I liked it very much!<br /><br />But it could have been better, I dislike the way that u block someone but<br />Their conversation still pops up on your conversion home screen.:-(
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|I have read literally hundreds of historical romance novels.  So as you might imagine, I have read many, many books with very similar themes.  This book is original.  Yes, love, misunderstandings, and romance are there, but the story line was itself interesting and unique.  This book should keep you turning the pages - eager to find what will happen next.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is a really special book. I wish it could go on forever. August really goes through a lot of tough things in his life and his 5th grade year changes that a lot.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Daniel Craig is THE Bond! I think this continuation of the 007 series is the best ever...tougher...grittier...meaner.  If you're more fond of the suave, debonair interpretation of the 00 (like Moore, Connery) you may not care much for &#34;ugly Bond&#34; (as my sister calls him). But if you like your Bond edgier ... get Skyfall.
1469226448|2.0|The characters were not engaging. I agree that it is a Titanic wannabe. The big secret at the end was a big disappointment.
0307010856|5.0|So funny, in fact, that I have been told to &#34;read it ONE more time&#34; about 25x in the single day we've had it.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|It arrived asap and it works great for watching video.  Luv the color and it fits perfectly!!  Not much more to say but that, thanks.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|Good movie, would recommend if you are looking for a easy viewing movie. I use to watch Hitchcock on tv growing up so this was a good look at the man behind the shows.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I thought the book was ok. But my favorite part is when they first started the big tribute/journey.<br /><br />  P.S.<br />  It was really good
B0034G4OYA|5.0|Hotel Transylvania has great quality and features. I also got it at a great price. I love this movie so much!
1400067820|5.0|I am a big fan of Nassim Taleb, and his latest book does not disappoint with its major contribution: to our detriment we have tried to eliminate risk from our lives, when instead we should seek out and learn from occasional, realized losses from taking small risks. This book is worthwhile reading despite its later repetitiveness and occasional grandstanding. Perhaps this is not on par with Taleb's previous masterpieces, The Black Swan and Fooled by Randomness, but worth the price of admission.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It was sex time after time, she was ignorant even though she was a college graduate, to have let him torture her like that.<br />The only reason I read the whole book was that I was hoping she would kill him for being so controlling!!  Glad she dumped him.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|After hearing all the 'news' stories aboutnhow the raid was conducted, I longed for the real stories. This book tells that story and even though the killing of bin Laden was a huge event, the story of the quiet professionals who sacrificed so much not only to make this operation possible, but to keep us all safer, is the real story.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|it is a story of real life and he is a little tougher than I think reality but he is very knowlegeable and knows how to get the job done.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|The storyline wasn't very clear and the accents were a bit tough to follow but the film was beautiful.  The book, however, was a lot better.  I don't think I've ever seen a movie from a book that was so poorly done as far as the storyline.  READ the book!  You won't be disappointed.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|It was well written from his standpoint but the action being limited, I did not have a page turning experience with this book.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|The movie, as a movie, was beautiful -- though it did have a sense of creeping dread.  But I was surprised to learn the CA13 only passed because eight people were absent or abstained. We should all be reminded and watch this movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun!Play with my brothers all the time...I can't wait to update!I reccomend for temple run players!
B00571F26Y|4.0|Totally opened my eyes to our countries current state, while awakening my mind to future food possibilities for a more healthful, wheat free life.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Highly entertaining and quirky procedural with a great spin on the Sherlock Holmes theme. Jonny Lee Miller walks the line of cold and logical with a caring heart very well and he lets a little more warmth seep through than other Sherlock's I've seen which makes him a touch more easier to relate to.  Also a great fix for those missing House, with all the elements of a drama, &#34;tell it like it is&#34; logic and the push/pull relationship of mentor to neophyte.  Plenty of dry quirky humor mixed throughout as well.
B004H4XI5O|4.0|Everyone could improve their memory and while this isn't a &#34;how to&#34; book, it does present some interesting ideas.  Buy it and try it!
B00BESIKWM|1.0|My husband is making me do this. That's how bad this movie is. We are both fans of the first one. Horrible plot, drawn out scenes, confusing characters.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|It has been years since I read a King novel.  His writing remains crisp, interesting and worthy of the reader's attention.<br /><br />I recommend this book because it is both well written and deals with one of our centuries greatest US tradegies so deftly and imaginatively<br /><br />King is a master.
B0074VA2T2|3.0|Only counts to five, works for the 2-yr-old but the other kids are completely bored.  Works best when kids are just flipping through games in restaurant or something similar.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I think this app is really cool but its very glitchy and slow.<br />My older sister said its great because you never has to sign in and I thought that was great which it is but its really annoying when my kindle fire has to &quot; force close&quot; the app because its glitchy and slow... ill keep the app, its cool, but a could be better.  (Then again the glitchyness could be bad Internet connection.)
B006TJXZ30|5.0|works great on my kindel frie hd I would say a must have. easy to use. Don't past the one up.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I thought temple run 1 was cool but temple run 2 is even better<br /><br />TEMPLE RUN = B0$S<br /><br />the best game ever don't hate cause you suck at it
B008CIUS72|2.0|can't find flash player. i well update this one on LATER date and time. I don't have any thing to say about this yet. Update 2/26/14: Shop Amazon. This item works very well with no problems. I was able to get flash player on my Kindle. Must have ES to save it in, must have dolphin browser to open up Flash Player When going online.go on your PC to get Flash Player download it to your PC then download to your Kindle. it will store in ES. You can access it when you go on Dolphin Browser. IT will open up YouTube, allow you to complete checkouts to buy online. Google search that's great also. That's my updates. If you are having problems go to ASK: How to ?
B0007PALZ2|3.0|It was certainly good to see Frank Gorshin again. The young woman playing the psychiatrist was nice to look at. The Philadelphia Municipal Center, at least it was that when I lived in the City, aroused some pleasant memories for me. Let me see.  Oh, yes, there were a few minutes of the recognition of love between the two leads which had some appeal.<br />What else? Nothing else. This is a variation on an ancient film plot to which nothing has been  added having visual, intellectual or emotional appeal. No doubt Bruce Willis was paid an enormous sum to do what a third rate Broadway hack could have done as well for 5% (or less) of the salary and percentage cut that he commands; but, the Bruce Willis name is about the only thing the film had to offer to draw in the general audience.<br />If you are another of the Washed Masses, I would avoid this and pick up something entertaining .<br />Oh, yes, Brad Pitt was also in it. Luster it will not add to his resume.
B0019IB0II|5.0|I have been meditating for years, after reading this book, I have much insight about what is actually happening as I meditate...
B008ODZNLG|4.0|A colleague from work suggested to watch this move.  This is an interesting documentary about one of the best sushi chefs in the world.  After watching this movie I consider making a reservation at his restaurant for my next visit to Japan.<br /><br />I watched this movie for FREE with my Amazon Prime.  Amazon Instant Video quality was very good on my Roku 2 XS.
078322737X|5.0|Just a fun nostalgic film. Great cast..fun to watch them when they were first getting their start. This is just a good fun, feel good movie. Great soundtrack.
B00BESFWBY|5.0|Great movie for the whole family! It was very entertaining and inspiring. The whole family will enjoy. Makes you want to learn how to surf!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Vic is a skilled cop who does a lot of good in the community it seems, by keeping gang violence way down and putting away every kind of murderer or rapist imaginable. However, he's also a corrupt drug dealer and cop-killer. They manage to reconcile the two into a morally ambiguous cop with a good sense of humor and tons of clout. You end up rooting for him despite the bad stuff, not an easy task for any show. Well done
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I have loved fringe since it first came on and just watched the first season again after watching the series finale. It still holds up after the years of watching the rest of the series. I highly recommend this series if you like mind-bending sci-fi.
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|Enjoyable story with some creative twists.  You've got your gruff male character paired with your ever-so-cute little girl character that find themselves in a knotty situation and end up learning a lot about themselves while making the world a better place in the process To do so, they need to summon great courage within themselves and depend on lots of luck.  Great themes about self-sacrifice, doing the right thing and the error of &#34;judging a book by its cover&#34;.  Fun nostalgia for anyone who is in their 40's today, jokes for everyone in the family, likeable characters, a creative premise for the story and satisfying ending.  A bit predictable at times and you sometimes need to press the &#34;whatever - just go with it&#34; button, but well worth the rental.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Bad audio? Set the Logitech 7.1 surround settings to 9/11 or 10/11 and leave the subwoofer at 11. Now, work your magic on the equalizer!<br />Great audio and build quality. Love walking away from Teamspeak and still being part of the conversation thanks to the G-keys!!!
B008602KQI|5.0|I have it on my pc as a download and watched it several times already, but I bought a new 40&#34; LED TV and sure enough...I missed some details!!<br /><br />Can't wait for the new movie to come out, if it is anything like book 2 it will be awesome!!
B004DNWPY4|4.0|An excellent description and narrative of authoritative quantitative research.  Highly recommended for those interested in the mentality of wealth accumulation in America.
0439023513|5.0|Wow!!  Can hardly wait for this to come out on DVD...imagine the impact this will have on anti-government wingnuts and conspiracy theory whackjobs...smh
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I use this alarm every morning. usually, just mornings as i am getting dressed and ready for work. i use it and love it...
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Best mobile keyboard available. Easy to use. The flow feature is awesome. Fast and accurate predictions. Great customizable options. Language support is also great.
B00BESNKB8|1.0|Awful script. Horrible acting. This is what happens when a fan with some funds but little to no experience manages to convince enough big names to contribute Nuff said.
B0053JJLLC|5.0|I love both Michael Crichton's and Richard Preston's books, so of course I loved this book!  I especially liked the discriptions and dangers of the rainforest as it would appear to people shrunk down so small.
B00BGZ8TVA|1.0|Does not work on a cerebral level or even as a nice family film.  For castaway films...especially if they are intended to be on the cerebral side...there a better choices.  Something with Tom Hanks would be better!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The ending is amazing. I couldnt put it down the whole time i have been on the plane. Read it!!!
B00BF11UM0|1.0|Rent before you purchase...not worth the money or the Oscar.  Certainly not good as an action movie and even worse as something cerebral.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|es un producto muy liviano, duradero y comodo, vale la pena la compra. Con un diseno muy especial. Realmente vale la pena.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I love this ap.  It was well worth the $2.00.  I had no problem with this ap. on my Kindle.
B00BBW16HW|4.0|Our son recommended this movie to us very strongly, and my wife and I enjoyed it very much. We watched it at home on our TV.<br />The only problem, which made the movie less enjoyable, is that the English subtitles are in white fonts without a solid background and are sometimes difficult to read.
B0036R92V2|5.0|Film Buff enjoyed this adaptation  very much and thought it better than what is being shown at this time on area screens.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|A Zoo a boat a young lad. Almost like Noah's Ark. A tiger with a strange name is still a tiger. You must wait to the very end for the clincher but you will be astounded by this young man and it won't leave your thoughts for some time!
B009CVELHG|5.0|person receiving this gift enjoyed it very much.  This individual has an extensive library of original films and considers this one very special.
B00846WWVM|4.0|I haven't had a lot of time to play this, but so far I enjoy it. The graphics are beautiful, but it is a memory hog. It is designed for children older than 5. It is too complicated for younger ones.
B005ZNLZRY|5.0|I had 2 hours of this particular video on my DVR for over 2 years now-thanks for your prompt delivery and it was exactly as the 1 I had recorded nothing left out....Perfect! Thank you so very much, Tracy
B00C1BUYX4|1.0|The quality of the video was not that great, the play feed was not consistent.  I also don't feel that the movie itself was good.  I wanted to give it a shot, but overall I was just not pleased.
1452110581|5.0|Love this book. I bought some copies as gifts and my friends all enjoyed it immensely. I would recommend it to all cat lovers!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very easy to use with a quick view to see what life is left and how long you have if you continue to use your device when the power is getting low. Quick, simple, useful and easy, What more could you ask.
B00AAQHP66|5.0|I loved this movie because Jay Moriarty is a local legend, a great surfer and a quality human being. I liked seeing all the Santa Cruz and San Mateo county scenes. The Santa Cruz ones especially were lovely. I would recommend this movie to all who love surfing, all who love and respect Jay Moriarty, and all of us in Santa Cruz!
0060254920|5.0|This is the book that started me off in search of childhood books. The artwork is beautiful. The story line took me back to what it was like to have an uninhibited imagination growing up.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read! It keeps you completely engaged and wanting to know what will happen next.
0151003084|5.0|I was taken aback at first by the content of this alphabet. I had forgotten how irreverent Edward Gorey could be. I ordered this book for the artwork, but once I got into the mood of the book, I enjoyed it.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|This book is a childhood favorite. I reread it all the time and love to share this timeless story with others. Even today it is a book that should be on a young girl's Kindle or bookshelf!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I loved the movie!  I could not wait for the sequels and buy the whole collection later on.  Love anything Tolkien!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I love this gritty cop show and look forward to watching the rest of the seasons. If you're an FX station fan, you'll recognize great character actors from other series (SoA and Damages)
B001AITH50|3.0|Memorable but not great . Movies are rarely as good as the book, but if your lucky they create their own niche . It was worth the price amazon currently is offering.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|Loved all the little critters. Very well thought out movie! Great movie, my little girl loved it. Lot's of song numbers which held my little girls attention. Great story line about what it would be like without trees. Would be a great movie for Arbor Day!!! It would be great to see a part two where everyone is planting trees and helping our planet!!
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|Liked the movie. First time using amazon rentals via TiVo. Video was less than half my screen. Thought it was supposed to be in HD. Video quality was crap. Back to iTunes.
B007UR1OHO|5.0|Great movie but it did not follow the book so I was a little disappointed that it didn't follow the book more closely.  It had great actors/actresses but there was so much that was missed<br />so read the book first and then watch the movie.  The movie was good just because it had Channing Tatum in it and - Gosh I can't think of her name but the actress that played his wife did a great job and she is so pretty and precious that I can't fault her for a part well played.  I just wish they had written the screenplay so that it had followed the book more closely.  It wasn't the fault of the actors/actresses.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I highly recommend this game because it is challenging and fun to play. Its a twist to solitare and I really enjoy it.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|This movie was just plain funny!!  If you like the base humor of the TV show Family Guy you will love this movie.  Often crude, inappropriate for children in every way.  Plan to pee your pants laughing.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|My daughter and I both downloaded this game and neither of us can stop playing it!  It will keep you entertained for hours.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The book Life of Pi is a fantastic story about survival. I liked this book so much that I don't think I can find anything that I dislike about it. Everything about it was perfect, the descriptive language, the creative elements, and of course the organization of ideas. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes stories of survival or anyone who has doubt in their faith.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, the journey Harold took was not just about the adventures that he had but more the life experience he gained from the people he met, the satisfying ending was a lesson that we can all learn from
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Mr. Grisham did it again...:) Good choice for casual reading both for English language natives and foreigners who seek nice book to read...Enjoy it :)
B0058VW36U|5.0|Very entertaining. Fun for the whole family. The game has a lot of great levels. Even my four year old loves it.
0446572985|4.0|The Innocent was classic Baldacci. A very good novel about Will Robie, who works as an assassin for DCIS. Robie is set up on a hit and works with an orphaned teenage girl and and FBI agent to solve the crime. David Baldacci is one of my guilty pleasure authors and this novel was even better than most of his works. There is a great twist at the end that I never saw coming.
B000YJ5X90|5.0|Highly recommend this book. Considering this new way of eating versus a diet will change your whole outlook on food.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I love this series I re-watch it every 12-18 months.  I watch other shows just because they have actors in them from this series.  Thoroughly enjoyable.
B008BSOAPE|4.0|The book was good but since it was John Green (ad i found his other books outstanding) I expected more
B00BIPCXJM|5.0|I watched this series after noticing the positive reviews on Amazon.  I should have paid attention to it long ago, it's well worth watching.
B000QI2ZWW|5.0|Kids under 2 yrs old love this movie due to the wonderful music and bright colors.  Even if they don't understand the words, it keeps their attention.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love it I like how you can jump and run on the trains! this is such a great app but more than once ive bottom smudged when 2 trains go by and I don't know how to get out of it! other than that you tottally have to get this game and its free!!
B000056Q81|4.0|Both my husband and I enjoy listening to Francoise Hardy.  Even tho I want some of her contemporary music, I started with her early years and have not been disappointed.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Read it for the second time and love it even more!! So super excited for Walking Disaster to come out!!!
0399226907|5.0|This book is exactly what I was looking for, I love hard books without the pages that are so easily torn and rumpled by little hands. It is simple, small and colourful. The same story I know and love from my own childhood.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Great book Jeff Kinney won't disappoint you when it comes to laughs and a great book to please any reader!
B00BF123WG|4.0|I was really anticipating the availability of Zero Dark Thirty on my KIndle Fire. The movie focused on the intel gathering and the politics the CIA had to deal with to eventually get the ok from President Obama.<br />The only criticism I have is that when the actual raid took place, the screen was black and you could not see anything. I don't know if this was on purpose, because it really had you paying very close attention and had you moving the KIndle Fire to avoid the glare. I'm curious to see what that scene looks like on a HD TV, and that it was just the glare.<br />We take for granted what goes on to protect our freedoms in the USA and the people that do all the very dirty and necessary behind the scene black ops missions. Thank you to those people who prevent and fight for the USA. I appreciate your patriotism.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Neither of the main characters is someone that you care about. Some of the other characters seem like  caricatures rather than believable people.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|I am a big history buff and this series really provides an interesting insight on how England might have been during this period of time.  This show had my total interest and I had to view all of the movies once I started watching the first one!  I would certainly recommend seeing this, in fact I have seen it at least 3 times now.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love playing this and it connects with my facebook game so always up to date. No problems with it at all.
B0097C8XL0|3.0|it has a lot like temple run<br />except with penguins<br />u can unlock new penguins for fishes ($ for them)
B00B5JVXYC|5.0|I could easily be lured into playing this for hours. It's easy, it's fun,  I recommend it for fellow Kindlers.
B007X4ECMI|5.0|If you are looking for an action movie that accomplishes an impossible task, then this movie is just what you need.  Guy Pearce delivers an irrevant character with cheeky dialogue all the while taking on an off planet prison filled with 500 inmates.  What could be more believable!!! This movie was made to entertain and it does just that.  So if you want to see a movie where you don't have to think to much about the plot and see a lot of action, then I would recommend Lockout.
B009DQQF7Y|5.0|For months when I've shopped this album would show up as a recommendation.  I couldn't get much of a feel from the samples, but I decided to take the plunge and get it.  Wow!  What an epiphany!  Excellent compositions beautifully executed.  Every listen reveals a new dimension.  Definitely one of the best albums I've picked up in awhile.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I remember when this incident happened but I was fuzzy on the details.  I thought the movie did a good job trying to stay true to the actual events as I remembered them.  It also helped fill in some of the blanks of information that I did not know.  As far as being a movie is concerned, Argo was well done with enough drama and action to keep my attention.
B0001932ZA|4.0|Husband enjoyed this one. Again, another one for his collection. Might have to start up my own collection, with movies I love.
B003R50F00|5.0|Some authors just floor me. What an amazing way to narrate a story and an amazing approach to story telling. I won't tell you who it is  that narrates the story, you have to work it out. Once you have it is just a fantastic read. ( It makes the first couple of chapters tricky ) Amazing insight into events of the times and how people coped, lived, survived. The complexity of the relationships  that develop through out the story make it a dynamic read.<br />The characters are so well developed and believable, I was sad to leave them at the end of the book.<br />Just loved it.<br />I would recommend it to anyone who really love character driven plots.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I don't watch Glee.  I have never watched Glee.  I don't intend to watch Glee.  So have no fear.<br />Pitch Perfect was downright, tears in your eyes funny.  Some old one liners, and some stereotypes played off, but in a whole new light. And some shocking one liners that played perfectly to the movie.  Since they're not trying to be serious, they are able to put together a great mix of characters, and each gets in their lines.<br /><br />Aside from the laughs, the music is great.  Very entertaining, and the singing is top notch.<br /><br />There are plenty of visual jokes as well, so pay attention.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|It took me  two or three chapters  to tune into the &#34;voice&#34; Very Gen Y.<br />I was then intrigued. By the end of the book I wished she had had a better editor and also ended it better.<br />A few unbelievable &#34;holes&#34; in the plot but overall quite a good read. Bet there is a sequel coming.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love this book not just because it's based in my hometown of Pittsburgh but because I remember the awkwardness of high school and dealing with that and emotional trauma. I wish I had my own Sam and Patrick right now because I feel that loneliness. This book and its movie make me feel understood and loved.
0060012234|5.0|In the conservative, oppressive town of Goodkind, Russel Middlebrook faces his biggest fear--publicly coming out--as he slowly discovers there are others at his own school, stubbornly questioning and reconciling with their sexualities, just like he is. In this town and in this decade, gay-straight alliances are unheard of--scorned, even--but upon kindling a brotherhood with the diverse group of people who are so different from him, and yet so similar, he learns that sometimes being yourself, no matter how hard, is more important than any reputation, any sort of acceptance, and any lie he'd be living otherwise.<br /><br />I was so impressed by this children's LGBT novel both because of the controversial topic it daringly confronts, and by the strength and grace with which it is written. Russel's realistic first-person narrative--one of the pioneering gay narrations in YA fiction--is a pleasure to read and captures the horrors and injustices of the high school social scene penetratingly, but in an appropriate, parent-approved fashion. I loved him as a character as well; he's so awkward, nice, and hilarious in an adorable teenage boy way. We need more gay narrators for YA!<br /><br />I also adore Russel's best friends, Min and Gunnar, because they aren't portrayed as the typical \\"he's been my BFFL and always has my back no matter what\\" crap. They're so flawed--so flavored--and that makes them so, so real.<br /><br />This book is touching, frightening, and compelling in all the right paces. It accurately conveys the fear of learning to cross and even break the invisible, vicious barriers within the high school social ladder, but not explicitly; it leaves just enough to the imagination, which is why I wholeheartedly recommend it to the younger crowd, too.<br /><br />The unexpected alliance Russel finds within Goodkind High School, the belonging and the assurance, highlights the importance of companionship and honesty of which I think all teenagers still need to be reminded. Even though Geography Club was written over ten years ago, the relationships Hartinger portrays stand the test of time in a poignant, universal story that readers of any age and any sexual orientation will love. In Geography Club, a handful of brave, passionate students stumble upon a connection in which they each can be completely honest with each other, as well as with themselves, for the first time in their young lives. This exchange of feelings and struggles that would otherwise be repressed is both gritty and soulful, and constitutes a brilliant coming-of-age novel.<br /><br />Pros: Interesting, suspenseful storyline // Cutting humor--I laughed out loud so many times! // Realistic, but still lovable characters // Russel's voice is so accurate // Tackles a sensitive issue fluidly and in a way that will encourage young readers<br /><br />Cons: Not enough rising action... wish there'd been more drama before the final climax<br /><br />Love: We bought tickets for the stupid romantic comedy rated PG-13, but once we were inside the multiplex, Kimberly said she wanted to see the stupid erotic thriller rated R instead. As for me, I didn't want to see either the romantic comedy or the erotic thriller. I wanted to see the animated Disney musical, which I guess just proved that I really was the gay boy that I'd been thinking all along that I was.<br />--LOL this is why I love Russel!<br /><br />Verdict: Brent Hartinger's inspiring and dazzling debut isn't just a novel about gay adolescents; it touches upon important global teen matters of friendship, identity, and the courage to speak out, as well. I loved everything about it--the characters, the voice, the absorbing plot--and think it's one of those books that all young adult (14-16) and maybe the more-mature middle grade (11-14) readers ought to try.<br /><br />Source: Complimentary copy provided by author in exchange for an honest and unbiased review (thank you!).ed.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it. Can't wait to read book three. The suspense keeps you reading until late in the night only recharging the kindle provides a break.
B003MXGNX0|2.0|WARNING: SPOILERS BELOW<br /><br />They should have called this one X-Men: Everyone Dies. It was just not a good film. The deaths seemed contrived for shock value, but I didn't feel anything when they died. Also, the film's plot was WAY too political - very heavy-handed. Just didn't work for me at all. I hadn't seen it since it was originally released, and I thought I'd give it another try... but it's still just not very good.
B009NQXXZ6|5.0|The blu ray edition is clean, sharp, and all Streisand.

0060989157|5.0|I just found this book, and even if you were never a Motley fan, I think you're going to enjoy this read.  It will suck you into the vortex of the decadent \\"rock n roll\\" life that so many bands have experienced, but never had the courage or stupidity(?)to put in writing.  For those of you who don't believe the stories or that they're exaggerated, I beg to disagree.  I think there are eveen darrker things they could have shared.  Yes, some of it is hard to read, they commmit some truly despicable acts and behave astonishingly awful to each other as well as outsiders.  Just take their namess and pictures out and insert with your favorite rock bands and I believe you'll find similarities.  Today it's the wrap artists who behave anywhere near what Motley did in their hey dey.....after reading this Motley just set the bar on how decadeent careless and destructively<br />a human can act and still be alive and functioning...and no one since has come close to beating that mark....you'll find Nikki is the real leader of the band, Vince IS really an unsympathetic character, Mick is truly a tortured soul but loyal to Nikki to the end, and Tommy....well dude,you'll find out he's the most musically talented in the band....but, also one of the dumbest.  Sit back and just enjoy the ride, it's not going to deliver world peace, provide you with a deep spiritual message.  But that's the point, it's not supposed to

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Ok, so I didn't think I'd like it. I had to be dragged into reading this, kicking and screaming. What a BLAST! I'm normally just a killer/shoot 'em up/mystery novel kind of gal and I really hate the lovey-dovey, kissy stuff (which I thought this would be, I know, I totally missed out on ALL the thousands of tv interviews apparently, my mistake). This book had me smiling, giggling to myself, hot and bothered, excited to go to bed! It's really a fun book. Well worth the money.

B00AO686L0|4.0|It was the critically acclaimed film of 1999 and a film that would jumpstart the career of filmmaker Michael Mann (\\"Heat\\", \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\", \\"Miami Vice\\", \\"Ali\\", \\"Public Enemies\\", \\"Collateral\\").<br /><br />\\"The Insider\\"which starred Al Pacino (\\"The Godfather\\" films, \\"Scarface\\", \\"Heat\\"), Russell Crowe (\\"L.A. Confidential\\", \\"Gladiator\\", \\"3:10 to Yuma\\") and Christopher Plummer (\\"A Beautiful Mind\\", \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\", \\"Syriana\\"), was a story that was inspired by a Vanity Fair article titled \\"The Man Who Knew Too Much\\" written by Marie Brenner and adapted into a screenplay by Eric Roth (\\"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\\", \\"Forrest Gump\\", \\"Munich\\") and Michael Mann.<br /><br />Back when Michael Mann was working on the film \\"Heat\\", when he was contacted by his friend Lowell Bergman, a producer at \\"60 Minutes\\" who was going through major challenges in his life but as the two kept in touch over the years, Mann would eventually conceive a story about the central figure that Bergman and \\"60 Minutes\\" was working on and that is the whistleblower Jeffrey Wigan who revealed that cigarette companies manipulated the tobacco to increase the amount of nicotine in cigarette smoke (which enhances the addictive and pleasurable effects of cigarette smoking).<br /><br />While the film was not a big success in the box office, the film received critical praise for its story and the performance of its cast.  Earning many awards for Christopher Plummer and Russell Crowe and also being nominated for 7 Academy Awards, including Best Picture.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"The Insider\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:39:1 aspect ratio).  For this 1999 film, \\"The Insider\\" continues to look fantastic, moreso in HD.  Picture quality reveals amazing detail in closeups, the cinematography by Dante Spinotti and the editing for the film is amazingly done.  Colors are rich, skin tones are natural, black levels are nice and deep.  I didn't see any signs of excessive DNR, the film looks very good on Blu-ray.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"The Insider\\" is a film that is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, French 5.1 Dolby Digital and Spanish 2.0 Dolby Digital.  The lossless soundtrack is dialogue driven and dialogue is crystal clear.  This is a type of film that didn't really need to utilize the surround channels, but it does a little in scenes showcasing crowd ambience.  But for the most part, the lossless soundtrack is adequate for this type of film.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"The Insider\\" come with the following special features:<br /><br />  Production Featurette - (7:05) Featuring a production featurette with the real Lowell Bergman and Jeffrey Wigand with commentary by Al Pacino and Russell Crowe.<br />  Theatrical Trailer - (2:33) The original theatrical trailer for \\"The Insider\\".<br /><br />NOTE:  While the rear info. shows a \\"Inside a Scene\\" which was featured in the original 2000 DVD, it is not included on this Blu-ray.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"The Insider\\" is one of the most riveting and intelligent films that was released in theaters back in 1999.  I absolutely loved the film as it really gave viewers a chance to see how far Big Tobacco companies would go, to intimidate former employees who went against the confidentiality agreement.  But also, how much control these companies have over media.<br /><br />CBS' \\"60 Minutes\\" is a respectable news show, heavy hitting questions from Mike Wallace, able to get the interviews before their news counterparts for other networks.  It was a shock to the public to find out that they would not air a program in fear of a lawsuit.  Especially when their obligation was to feature important news and in this case, had Jeffrey Wigand,  VP of Research and Development, who knew the secrets that went on behind-the-scenes for the Big Tobacco companies in regards to Nicotine addictiveness.<br /><br />Big Tobacco companies go as far to halt the original interview and prevent CBS from airing it, but what I loved about this film is how Lowell Bergman was able to orchestrate, out of desperation, to sacrifice his career in order to get this show broadcasted by using his journalists contacts for major newspapers to come to bat for him.  And literally an orchestration that would shock America.<br /><br />And the end result of this situation is 46 states filing a medicaid suit against the tobacco industry and leading to a historic $368 billion settlement in health-related damages by the tobacco companies.<br /><br />And in 2013, the events featured on \\"The Insider\\" and what took place many years ago is still relevant.  In November 2012, a Federal Judge Gladys Kessler ordered that tobacco companies publicly admit through advertisements and package warnings that they deceived American consumers for decades about the dangers of smoking.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, \\"The Insider\\" benefits with its amazing detail courtesy of its HD release and crisper lossless audio.  Special features remain the same, albeit the missing \\"Inside a Scene\\" which was relevant in 2000, not so much today.  So, despite it being listed on the back, it's not included on this Blu-ray release.  But the film looks and sounds so much better than the original 2000 DVD.<br /><br />What transpired in \\"The Insider\\" was quite historic in many levels but how things played out behind-the-scenes, it's incredible just to even fathom how this was all orchestrated.<br /><br />While a fantastic film with wonderful direction, writing and excellent performances by Al Pacino, Russell Crowe and Christopher Plummer, unfortunately 1999 was one a competitive year for American cinema as films such as \\"American Beauty\\", \\"Cider House Rules\\", \\"Being John Malkovich\\", \\"Magnolia\\", \\"The Sixth Sense\\" and \\"The Green Mile\\" were all in the running for various award categories.<br /><br />If there was any major fault of the film, it's how various people were portrayed.  In an article from the Observer and also other news reports, Mike Wallace and \\"60 Minutes\\" executive producer Don Hewitt was misrepresented, that the two actually fought hard for the interview to air and did not cave to CBS' demands that easily.  As for how far Big Tobacco would go to intimidate a man, the F.B.I. has suggested that Wigand orchestrated the threatening e-mail message and the bullet in the mailbox.<br /><br />\\"The Insider\\" is still a relevant and compelling film as it was back in 1999, now in 2013.  From wonderful direction, writing and amazing performances, this is one film that will remain a classic for generations to come.  Despite how people may have been misrepresented in the film and how situations were dramatized, I think that Roger Ebert said it best in his review of the film back in 1999, \\"There is, I admit, a contradiction in a film about journalism that itself manipulates the facts. My notion has always been that movies are not the first place you look for facts, anyway. You attend a movie for psychological truth, for emotion, for the heart of a story and not its footnotes.\\"<br /><br />But there is no disputing the facts of what Big Tobacco companies tried to hide, one man exposing the truth, a man doing all he can to get his piece to air on television and news that would shock the world.  \\"The Insider\\" is effective when displaying those facts.  So much negative can be said with today's journalism and in its integrity during this social media age, but to have a film in which journalism brought out a greater good in its effort to bring out the truth about Big Tobacco companies is intriguing and incredible.

B0087IT8LO|5.0|When filmmakers Olivier Nakache and &Eacute;ric Toledano discovered the documentary \\"A la vie, a la mort\\", they discovered a touching story about a wealthy quadriplegic French Aristocrat named Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and his caretaker, an ex-con named Abdel Sellou.<br /><br />A paragliding accident that left di Borgo, the former director of the Pommery champagne house and second son of a French duke having an ex-con as his caretaker was a story you you don't see often.  But it was because of Abdel being vain, arrogant and someone who didn't feel sorry for him.  Which in the dozens and dozens of people that were interviewed to be a caretaker, most felt sorry for him.  But for Abdel, he was full of humor and made di Borgo feel life and brought happiness to his life because he was unexpected.<br /><br />And so the story goes, as Nakache and Toledano crafted a screenplay after the documentary but also the experiences of di Borgo from his best selling book \\"You Changed My Life\\", they visited di Borgo to read their script and di Borgo helped bring realism to the script (while some fictional experiences were added for comedy).  But with Di Borgo's go ahead, the film was made and would star actor Francois Cluzet (\\"Tell No One\\", \\"Little White Lies\\", \\"French Kiss\\"), Omar Sy (\\"Micmacs\\", \\"Those Happy Days\\"), Ann Le Ny (\\"The Tste of Others\\", \\"Declaration of War\\") and Audrey Fleurot (\\"Midnight in Paris\\", \\"Un Village Francais\\").<br /><br />The film would receive international critical acclaim.  The film won \\"Best Film\\" and \\"Best Actor\\" for both Cluzet and Sy at the Tokyo International Film Festival, Best Actor at the Cesar Awards and the film became the third highest grossing film in France, the highest-grossing movie in a language other than English worldwide, surpassing the record set by the animated film \\"Spirited Away\\" and also becoming the top grossing foreign language film of 2012 in North America.  While the film would stay at #1 in German for nine consecutive weeks, Switzerland for eleven weeks and multiple weeks for many other countries.<br /><br />Suffice to say, the film was a financial box office success for Gaumont and in the U.S., the film's rights for an American remake were purchased by the Weinstein Co.  And now this award winning film will be released on Blu-ray and DVD in March 2013 courtesy of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"The Intouchables\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  The film looks fantastic as skin tone are natural, black levels are nice and deep.  Closeups show amazing detail,  the film is colorful sharp and if anything, because of the multiple locations of where this film was shot, the cinematography by Mathieu Vadepieed (\\"Read My Lips\\", \\"In Your Hands\\") was beautifully shot.  I detected no aliasing or artifacts during my viewing of this film.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"The Intouchables\\" is presented in French 5.1 DTS-HD MA.  The dialogue for the film is crystal clear and while the film is dialogue driven, also good use of music with a wonderful score by Ludovico Einaudi (\\"This is England\\", \\"Insidious\\", \\"Aprile\\") and Earth, Wind and Fire coming clearly in lossles.  There are scenes with ambiance of crowds or car engine revving but for the most part, the lossless soundtrack is appropriate for this film.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English, English SDH and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"The Intouchables\\" come with the following special features:<br /><br />  Deleted Scenes - (5:35) Featuring five deleted scenes<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"The Intouchables\\" comes with an UltraViolet code which allows for one to download their film to a computer or on select Apple and Android devices and to stream to computers, tablets or smartphones.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Quite often you hear about a hype of a film, you wonder if its warranted.  It's one thing to hear a lot of hype when it comes from America but when a film begins to make an impact in several countries and stays at #1 for consecutive weeks, you know that the film must be special.<br /><br />And after watching \\"The Intouchables\\", I have to agree, this film is magnificent!<br /><br />Everything works so well with the film, from its writing, the humor, the outstanding performances by Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy but it's a storyline that you just never see too often. When it comes to films about paraplegic, the truth is that many films are about perseverance and having compassion for that person who was left injured and trying to manage life.<br /><br />But \\"The Intouchables\\" doesn't do that.  This is about an ex-convict who went into a job not for the sake of getting it, but for the sake of getting a rejection, having his paper signed in order to receive unemployment benefits.<br /><br />But it's the story of how a person, no matter how different they are, coming to a person's life at a time when they desperately need it.<br /><br />The character of Driss is in need of a job, a place to stay after getting kicked out of his apartment by his aunt, but what begins as a business relationship between caretaker and client, it became a relationship of friends in which Driss never treated Philippe with pity, he treated him like a normal guy, not afraid to crack jokes about staff or people, or even if he's in a wheelchair.<br /><br />The real Philippe that the film is based on said it perfectly in his interview with the UK Telegraph news publication about how important his caretaker was for him.  Philippe said, \\"He treated me like I needed to be treated in the tough times ahead, partly because of my condition but also because my wife was dying of cancer [she died three years after his accident]. I needed to be back on track. Pity is the last thing you need. Pity is hopeless. Pity is what someone gives you because he is afraid to take care of you. I didn't need that. But compassion I don't need also. It comes from Latin and means `suffering with'. I don't want you to be suffering with me. I need consolation, which in Latin means keeping me as a whole person, respecting me as I am.\\"<br /><br />The film is magnificent for the fact that it's an unlikely pairing, but its the growing relationship of these two men of how one is able to bring this man out of the darkness and enjoy life once again.<br /><br />One scene has Driss jogging while Philippe is trying to catch up with his wheelchair.  Not so thrilled that the wheelchair is slow, they modify it to make it go much faster.<br /><br />Another scene featured Philippe wanting to get away and take part in skydiving and Driss of course, is not interested but eventually for the sake of Philippe, he does it anyway.<br /><br />There are so many of these random moments of kindness that you don't expect from Driss, even tricking Philippe into smoking a joint or hiring beautiful Asian masseuses to work on him and his ears (which give him pleasure).<br /><br />This is a feel-good movie with a lot of charm and a lot of soul and it's a film that leaves you feeling happy and appreciative that you saw a film so enjoyable.  Sure, \\"Driving Miss Daisy\\", \\"The King's Speech\\" or \\"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly\\" and perhaps other films may come to mind, as this style of movie has been done before.  Sure, the film could have been more melodramatic, more serious but it wasn't.  It's a film that manages not to be too sad but has its interjection of humor and with the two wonderful performances by both Cluzet and Sy,  you can't help but feel captivated with what you saw.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality is fantastic, colorful and well-detailed and lossless audio was also crystal clear when it came to dialogue and music.  I did wish there were more special features included for a film that has received so much attention internationally.  Only five deleted scenes, no audio commentary, no featurettes, nothing.  So, if there was any low-point for this Blu-ray release, it's the lack of special features.<br /><br />I know that a few may find the film a bit repulsive that a caretaker would make fun of his paraplegic client in a certain manner, some that did not happen to the real Philippe but were featured in the film for comedy-sake, but through interviews I have read about Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and his caretaker, Abdel Sellou... this is what di Borgo needed, a caretaker who didn't treat him with pity or compassion, but on equal ground.  And that is why those two had that bond!<br /><br />While an American remake of \\"The Intouchables\\" is being planned, \\"The Intouchables\\" worked as a French film, as an American film, then things get a bit murky as people will question racial stereotypes, offensive treatment towards paraplegics and that it would have a negative impact for those in that industry.<br /><br />\\"The Intouchables\\" is not about race, not about disability, yes...one man in Black, one man is not.  One is disabled, the other is not.  One man is wealthy, the other is not.  Critic reviews from Europe differ from America as the race/stereotype issue is brought up here in the U.S.  But this is a film not about racial hatred or a film about poking fun on a severe disability, it's a movie about hope and no matter how these two individuals were raised, it's how they are when they were together and the fact that as in real life and as in the film, this caretaker was able to bring Philippe, something that he thought he had lost... happiness.<br /><br />\\"The Intouchables\\" is recommended!'. I don't want you to be suffering with me. I need consolation, which in Latin means keeping me as a whole person, respecting me as I am.\\"<br /><br />The film is magnificent for the fact that it's an unlikely pairing, but its the growing relationship of these two men of how one is able to bring this man out of the darkness and enjoy life once again.<br /><br />One scene has Driss jogging while Philippe is trying to catch up with his wheelchair.  Not so thrilled that the wheelchair is slow, they modify it to make it go much faster.<br /><br />Another scene featured Philippe wanting to get away and take part in skydiving and Driss of course, is not interested but eventually for the sake of Philippe, he does it anyway.<br /><br />There are so many of these random moments of kindness that you don't expect from Driss, even tricking Philippe into smoking a joint or hiring beautiful Asian masseuses to work on him and his ears (which give him pleasure).<br /><br />This is a feel-good movie with a lot of charm and a lot of soul and it's a film that leaves you feeling happy and appreciative that you saw a film so enjoyable.  Sure, \\"Driving Miss Daisy\\", \\"The King's Speech\\" or \\"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly\\" and perhaps other films may come to mind, as this style of movie has been done before.  Sure, the film could have been more melodramatic, more serious but it wasn't.  It's a film that manages not to be too sad but has its interjection of humor and with the two wonderful performances by both Cluzet and Sy,  you can't help but feel captivated with what you saw.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality is fantastic, colorful and well-detailed and lossless audio was also crystal clear when it came to dialogue and music.  I did wish there were more special features included for a film that has received so much attention internationally.  Only five deleted scenes, no audio commentary, no featurettes, nothing.

B009RWRIZ2|5.0|\\"Dance, Dance, otherwise we are lost\\"<br /><br />Pina Bausch, a German performer best known for her pioneering work on modern dance as a choreographer, teacher and a ballet director.<br /><br />A unique style that was bold, creative and different, so much that traditional dance critics had a hard time understanding her unique style back in the '70s.  But it's a style that people would soon regard as magnificent due to her blend of movements and prominent stage sets and her cooperation with performers during the composition of a piece (a style known as Tanztheater),<br /><br />For renown filmmaker Wim Wenders known for films such as \\"Wings of Desire\\", \\"Paris, Texas\\", \\"Until the End of the World\\", \\"The American Friend\\" and many more, his interest in Pina Bausch began in 1985 when he was dragged to a production by his friend Solveig Dommartin.  Having no interest in dance at the time, it was when he began to watch, he was so moved that he wept.<br /><br />Since then, he had co-authored a book with Donata Wenders titled \\"Pina: The Film and the Dancers\\", but for 20-years, he had wanted to make a documentary about Pina but at the time, there was no way to capture the dancing performance on camera, to make the audience feel anywhere close to how others feel when they watched a Pina Bausch production live.<br /><br />Fast forward to 2008 and when Wim Wenders watched 3D technology used in U2′s concert, he realized that he can now take on the film using modern digital 3D technology to give the illusion of depth.<br /><br />And so, Wim Wenders and Pina Bausch set out to create the documentary.  Unfortunately in 2009, Pina Bausch was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 68 and five days after diagnosis, she had past away, two days before the shooting of the documentary.<br /><br />But with the members of the Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch troupe encouraging Wenders to continue the documentary as a memorial for Pina Bausch, two years later, \\"pina\\" would premiere at the 61st Berlin International Film Festival.  It would receive critical acclaim worldwide and also nominated for an Academy award for \\"Best Documentary Feature\\".<br /><br />And now, \\"pina\\" will be released on Blu-ray 3D + Blu-ray combo and on DVD courtesy of The Criterion Collection in January 2013.<br /><br />\\"pina\\" will feature excerpts from performances of \\"Cafe Muller\\", \\"Le sacre du printemps\\", \\"Knotakthof\\" and \\"Vollmond\\" from the members of the Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch troupe including interstitial scenes with the dancers who give their stories about Pina in their native language (with English subtitles) and also archived footage of Pena.<br /><br />Mesmerizing, beautiful and complex, we are taken on an adventure to an artistic world of Pina Bausch and learning how this woman, strict but a wonderful teacher, believed in her dancers to create magic and most importantly as Bausch had told one of her dancers, to have them \\"dance for love\\".<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />For \\"pina\\", the film was a laborious and challenging film for Wim Wenders and crew to take on and make sure everything looked right in 3D and the finally for the 2D version.<br /><br />It's important to note that to view the 3D version of the film, you must have a 3D Blu-ray enabled player and television.  And what is most amazing about the 3D presentation of \\"pina\\" is its depth.  This is one aspect of the film that the crew wanted to make sure they got it right and they did.  The feeling of depth and trying to capture how one would see things in a theater performance.  Bare in mind that it's not 100% exact in trying to capture that experience but the choice to shoot in 3D was the best choice because the film was able to accomplish depth using today's 3D technology with complete efficacy.<br /><br />Watching it in 2D, the film also looks amazing in colors and detail.  From the opening dance with the red dress which looks vibrant to the many outdoor and indoor scenes, this is a film that looks visually impressive and there are no problems with this Blu-ray whatsoever.  It's fantastic!<br /><br />According to the Criterion Collection, \\"pina\\" was shot in three shooting blocks, on three different camera systems: the Sony HDC-1500 in October 2009, the Sony HDC-P1 in April 2010 and the Sony EX3 in June 2010, using Zeiss DigiPrime lenses of 7 mm, 10 mm, 14 mm and 20 mm.  The on-set recording was done on a Sony SRW-1, on HDcam SR tapes and a Codex Server.<br /><br />The film was shot in high definition (1920 x 1080), and the final theatrical aspect ratio was 1:85:1 (1920 x 1038).  To achieve the image size required by the Digital Cinema Initiative's (DCI) specifications (1998 x 1080), black bars were added to the left and right of the image in the 3D and 2D Digital Cinema Packages (DCPs).  These bars were considered preferable to a zoom-in, as the latter would have decreased the sharpness of the image.  The bars were removed for the Blu-ray and DVD editions and replaced by black bars at the top and bottom of the screen, to maintain the original aspect ratio.  On standard 4:3 televisions, this image will be letterboxed.<br /><br />The post-production was done in a DPX-based digital workflow.  The theatrical color timing was done on Resolve 5, and the visual effects and retouching on Flame 2009.  The heart of the postproduction was a Mistika 5 station, where the onlining, conforming, stereoscopic sweetening, depth grading, reframing and 3D subtitling were done.<br /><br />The visual accuracy of Pina's subtitles is unique.  Typically, subtitles in a 3D movie are set at a screen level.  For Pina, every subtitle was individually and manually placed on the depth axis.  Some subtitles were even animated to allow for the most comfortable and natural 3D perception.<br /><br />The final DCP sequence was printed on 35 mm Kodak Negative 2383 stock using an ArriLaswer.  The DPX files were then timed in the Rec. 709 high-definition color space for recording on HDCam SR tape for broadcast and Blu-ray and DVD release.<br /><br />The 2D version of the 3D film was created as the best-eye version, using a careful selection of shots from either the left or the right eye.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"pina - The Criterion Collection #644″ is presented in lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack.  Because Pina Bausch's dancers are from various countries, the languages presented are in German, English, Russian, French, Italian, Slovene, Spanish, Portuguese and Korean with English subtitles.

Also, \\"Hotel Transylvania\\" will be released on Blu-ray 3D for those who do have an 3D enabled Blu-ray player and television.<br /><br />As for the DVD, let me just say that Sony Pictures Animation/Sony Pictures imageworks did a fantastic job with this film.  From the character design to the amount of detail seen n the film, while those watching it in HD, will see much more detail, the DVD still looks good.  Really good use of warm and cool colors throughout the film.  As for audio, the soundtrack may not be in lossless, but still, there is a good amount of action in the film that you can hear through the surround channels.  Dialogue and music is clear and sounds very good on DVD.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Hotel Transylvania\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by Director Genndy Tartakovsky, Producer Michelle Murdocca and Visual Effects Supervisor Daniel Kramer and the three really give good insight to the making of the film.

For children, the usually creepy characters such as Frankenstein, the Mummy, the Werewolf, etc. are presented in a non-threatening manner.  If anything, the film tries to show Dracula and the monsters as fearful of humans and are trying to protect their kind from being killed by humans.  In fact, Dracula doesn't even suck human blood and if anything, the monsters are portrayed more as a non-threatening endangered species who just want to be left alone.<br /><br />And part of the storyline revolves around a controlling and fearful father, Dracula, who cares deeply for his daughter Mavis.  But as Mavis is old enough to explore the world on her own and wants to get out and see it, it's about one father trying his best not to lose his daughter but also a fear that by exploring the world outside Hotel Transylvania, she may meet the same fate as Dracula's wife, who was killed by humans.<br /><br />But life changes for Mavis when she comes across a guy named Jonathan, who happens to be a human.<br /><br />\\"Hotel Transylvania\\" doesn't try to become an animated film that tries to tug on emotional sympathy.  The characters are eccentric, while rated-PG, the characters were made to be more upbeat and naive.  And parents, while rated PG, most of the film is not threatening.  Possible scenes that children may get scared at is Dracula turning into a vampire bat, pretend zombies being  accidentally burned by flames but there is no death but the story of Dracula discussing his wife's tragedy.<br /><br />Character animation is pleasing and for the most part, this film is upbeat, fun and just an entertaining film that is meant to entertain children.  No deep or complex story, no emotional storyline, just a straight-up story about a human who accidentally wanders into Hotel Transylvania and Dracula tryingto find a way to keep him concealed from his guests and also prevent him getting close to his only daughter.<br /><br />Voice acting for the most part is done well by its cast of big names such as Adam Sandler, Andy Samberg, Selena Gomez, David Spade, Fran Derescher, CeeLo Green, Chris Parnell to name a few.<br /><br />As for the DVD, the Blu-ray release actually is better in terms of picture quality, lossless audio soundtrack and more special features.  The DVD does look good but doesn't come with all the special features as its Blu-ray counterpart.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Hotel Transylvania\\" is a good film that features a lot of entertaining and fun moments.  It's a bit silly but children will love the fart jokes, the humor and the pleasing animation.  Parents shouldn't worry too much and there is no major violence or anything too scary but for those the scenes I mentioned earlier, parental guidance is suggested.<br /><br />A fun family film for the entire family, \\"Hotel Transylvania\\" is a beautifully animated film from Sony Pictures Animation and Sony Pictures Imageworks, that will make children laugh from beginning to end!<br /><br />An entertaining animated film worth checking out!he ability to stream to computers, tablets or smartphones.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"Hotel Transylvania\\" is a fun animated film that is a fun treat for an animated film.

B00ALCBU4M|3.0|Back in 2006, \\"Company of Heroes\\" became the highest rated real-time strategy videogame for the PC.  Developed by Relic Entertainment and published by THQ, news of a film adaptation inspired by the video game and true events from World War II began to materialize.<br /><br />But due to the unknown climate of the video game industry and THQ filing bankruptcy, not much was known about the status of the live action film.<br /><br />While Relic Entertainment was sold to Sega in January 2013, thus prolonging the life of the \\"Company of Heroes\\" video game series, the film which was originally to be released in theaters is now being released direct-to video on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.<br /><br />Directed by actor Don Michael Paul (\\"The Garden\\", \\"Who's Your Caddy?\\") and written by David Reed (\\"Supernatural\\", \\"Battlestar Galactica\\"), the low budget World War II film would star Tom Sizemore (\\"Saving Private Ryan\\", \\"Black Hawk Down\\", \\"Heat\\"), Chad Michael Collins (\\"Lake Placid 2″), Vinnie Jones (\\"X-Men: The Last Stand\\", \\"Swordfish\\", \\"Snatch\\"), Dimitri Diatchenko (\\"Chernobyl Diaries\\", \\"Get Smart\\", \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\"), Neal McDonough (\\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\", \\"Minority Report\\", \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\"), Jurgen Prochnow (\\"Das Boot\\", \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", \\"The English Patient\\") and Richard Sammel (\\"Inglourious Basterds\\", \\"Casino Royale\\").<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Company of Heroes\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition and featured in 1:78:1 aspect ratio.  First, I need to emphasize that this film was made with a low budget and this is not a huge World War II production.  While Director Don Michael Paul knew the budget limitations for \\"Company of Heroes\\", for the most part, he was able to make things work by focusing on the characters and for surroundings, making things ominous by having the characters in snow and around trees and branches.  But skin tones do look natural, close-ups were very effective and black levels were very good.<br /><br />The film relied on characters taking action during the dark or in the snow and for that, it does give an ominous presence towards the film. But what makes the film feel like World War II is through the costume design by Anna Gelinova (\\"Hitman\\", \\"Expendables 2″).  While I'm not an erudite on World War II garb, the crew did their research in trying to make the film look as authentic as possible with the limitations that they had.  You're not going to see a wide shot of a plethora of tanks or hundreds of soldiers but the shots and action sequences were carefully planned.  I didn't need so much to see blood spurting out as much but the film does look good on Blu-ray and for the most part, I do feel that with the budget that the crew had, they made the film feel right in terms of presentation.  I didn't notice any aliasing or specks or any problems with picture quality during my viewing.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Company of Heroes\\" is presented in English, French and Portuguese 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  Fortunately, there are a good number of heavy action scenes that utilized the surround channels with efficacy.  Dialogue is crystal clear, as well as musical score by Frederik Weidmann (\\"Hostel Part III\\").<br /><br />Subtitles are in English, Engish SDH, Arabic, Chinese (Mandarin, Traditional), Chinese (Mandarin, Simplified), Dutch, French, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish and Thai.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Company of Heroes\\" come with the following special features:<br /><br />  Deleted Scene: Kestrel and Squad Meet in a Safe House - (2:57) One deleted scene.<br />  In the Trenches - (10:28) Featuring interviews with Director Don Michael Paul, producer Jeff Beach and the cast and discussion of the differences between the film and the video game.<br />  Fabricating World War II - (5:41) Director Don Michael Paul discusses making a war movie and trying to make it look authentic as possible on a low budget.<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"Company of Heroes\\" comes with an UltraViolet code which allows for one to download their film to a computer or on select Apple and Android devices and to stream to computers, tablets or smartphones.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />The first thing that fans of \\"Company of Heroes\\" will wonder is \\"if the film is any good?\\".<br /><br />I can understand.  A low-budget war film that went straight from direct-to-video and a director who does not have an A-list film to his credit may turn some people off.<br /><br />But you never know as one may be able to make something incredible as Stanley Kubrick accomplished with a very low budget for his film debut and his war film, \\"Fear and Desire\\".  Or something disappointing and not worth your time.<br /><br />With Don Michael Collins, I have to say that when it comes to a popcorn action World War II film, he was able to create an entertaining film despite operating with a low budget.<br /><br />First, let me just say that this is not a film that is deep in plot.  Nor is it a film where one who is used to watching big budget action, will see a plethora of tanks, soldiers or a film about company bravado like the \\"Band of Brothers\\" TV series.<br /><br />But what we have is a war film about a group of soldiers facing a significant challenge in recovering a defecting German scientist who is in charge of a secret weapons program.<br /><br />While some may feel it is farfetched to have four soldiers (two Americans, one British and one Soviet) accomplishing a mighty task, this is not one of those films where you search for World War II accuracy.  Like the video game in which operations are inspired by true events but not exact events, having played many World War II video games, part of that excitement in the video game is trying to defeat the enemy, with what you have.  In this case, not much of trying to defeat the enemy with a large military force but to find the German scientist and leave!<br /><br />I don't care to see much in a war film is the overuse of blood squirting out of someones neck nor do I want to see a love angle in a war film.  The film incorporated a little of each but nothing that made me feel too bad about the film.<br /><br />As for the positives...a positive factor about this film is that it incorporates a few well-known names who have appeared on major big budget war films.  Tom Sizemore is best known for his roles in \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and \\"Black Hawk Down\\", Neal McDonough had appeared in \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" and \\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\", Jurgen Prochnow of \\"Das Boot\\" and \\"The English Patient\\" and Richard Sammel of \\"Inglorious Basterds\\" and you have others who also appeared on bigger budget film as well.<br /><br />With a tight schedule, low budget and only a day to film with a tank but still make the film feel believable and authentic, I just felt that with what Don Michael Paul had to work with, he and his crew did a good job.  Anna Gelinova was able to make the costume design feel right and to have cinematography focus on locations that take part in the dark, around snow or dirt, the crew and cast managed to make things work!<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality was very good.  Great detail on close-ups.  Lossless audio also featured good use of the surround channels and there were a few special features included.  It would have been great to have audio commentary included with this Blu-ray release.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Company of Heroes\\" is a popcorn action World War II film that may not be as memorable compared to many other World War II films out there, but I did find it entertaining.  Will fans of the video game enjoy this film?  I think that it will be subjective, but I do feel that for its low budget and the fact that the film does star a several well-known talent, the end result was much better than I expected.n a low budget.<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"Company of Heroes\\" comes with an UltraViolet code which allows for one to download their film to a computer or on select Apple and Android devices and to stream to computers, tablets or smartphones.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />The first thing that fans of \\"Company of Heroes\\" will wonder is \\"if the film is any good?\\".<br /><br />I can understand.

B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|In 2012, the 52nd animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series came out in theaters.<br /><br />\\"Wreck-It Ralph\\" is film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and is directed by Rich Moore (\\"The Simpsons\\", \\"Futurama\\") and features a screenplay by Phil Johnson (\\"Cedar Rapids\\", \\"A Thousand Words\\") and Jennifer Lee.<br /><br />Featuring an all-star cast as voice talent including John C. Reilly (\\"Step Brothers\\", \\"The Aviator\\", \\"Magnolia\\"), Sarah Silverman (\\"There's Something About Mary\\", \\"The School of Rock\\"), Jack McBrayer (\\"30 Rock\\", \\"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\\"), Jane Lynch (\\"Glee\\", \\"Role Models\\", \\"The 40 Year Old Virgin\\"), Alan Tudyk (\\"I, Robot\\", \\"Serenity\\"), Mindy Kailing (\\"The Office\\", \\"The Mindy Project\\"), Joe Lo Truglio (\\"Superbad\\", \\"Pineapple Express\\"), Ed O'Neill (\\"The Bone Collector\\", \\"Married with Children\\"), Dennis Haysbert (\\"24″, \\"Heat\\") and many more.<br /><br />The film received positive reviews from film critics and would be successful in the box office earning over $435 million (the film was budgeted at $165 million) and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and Academy Award for \\"Best Animated Feature\\" and won an Annie Award for \\"Best Animated Feature\\".<br /><br />And now \\"Wreck-It Ralph: Ultimate Collector's Edition\\" featuring the Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, DVD and Digital Copy will be released in March 2013.<br /><br />\\"Wreck-It Ralph\\" begins with the Litwak's Arcade closing up for the night.  The video game characters are seen leaving their video game and head home or travel to visit friends from other video games.<br /><br />We are introduced to Ralph (featuring the voice of John C. Reilly), the villain of the game \\"Fix-It Felix, Jr.\\".  Ralph wrecks a building and Felix, Jr. (voiced by Jack McBrayer), with his magic hammer, fixes it all up.<br /><br />But for Ralph, as much as he enjoys his role in the video game, Felix, Jr. receives all the credit and is often celebrated, while he goes home to a junk yard and just watches Felix, Jr. getting noticed all the time.<br /><br />Ralph explains to his support group of video game villains/antagonists that he wishes that he could be a good guy, but his fellow antagonists in the support group are worried that Ralph is turning \\"Turbo\\".<br /><br />One day, as Ralph is watching Felix, Jr.'s building from afar, he notices that he is having a 30th anniversary party and is shocked why he wasn't invited.<br /><br />Ralph decides to crash the party and Felix, Jr. allows him to show up and eat some cake.  But other Nicelanders at the party are not thrilled that he is there because he causes nothing but trouble and breaks things.  But Ralph tells them that he wants to be a good guy but no one believes him,  They tell him to leave because Felix, Jr. is going to be presented with a medal.<br /><br />Ralph vows he will get a medal but no one pays him any mind.<br /><br />As Ralph goes to the pub, he is told that he may be able to find a medal at the lost and found but while he is looking, he sees a hysteric soldier complaining about finding cybugs for a medal.  This automatically catches Ralph's attention and when the soldier accidentally runs into a wall and knocks himself out, Ralph takes the soldiers uniform and dresses up as a soldier and enters the \\"Hero's Duty\\" video game.<br /><br />Ralph meets Sergeant Calhoun (voiced by Jane Lynch) who gets the soldiers ready for their upcoming battle.  And as the soldiers fight against the Cy-Bugs, Ralph decides to climb the game's central beacon to collect his medal, so he can show the Felix, Jr. and the Nicelanders that he received a medal.  But Ralph ends up hatching a Cy-Bug and it clings to Ralph and activates a space craft and both escapee from the \\"Hero's Duty\\" video game and ends up flying to the \\"Sugar Rush\\" video game and runs into a girl named Vannelope von Schweetz (voiced by Sarah Silverman), a girl who takes his medal and plans to use it for her upcoming race.  Ralph tries to chase after her in order to getthe medal back.<br /><br />Meanwhile, back at the \\"Fix-It Felix, Jr.\\" video game, at the arcade, a teenage girl tries to play \\"Fix-It Felix, Jr.\\" but without Ralph back in the video game, there is no villain and so, Litwak puts a malfunction sign to the game and this causes Felix, Jr. and the Nicelanders major concern as a malfunctioning game that is quite old and it could be the end of their game.<br /><br />So, Felix, Jr. goes to look for Ralph and meets with Sgt. Calhoun to find out that Ralph has led a Cy-bug to another video game.<br /><br />This causes Sgt. Calhoun great concern because Cy-Bug's can replicate and infect other video games and take over the game.  We see her back story comes to show that her fiance was killed in a video game when she didn't check on Cy-Bugs before her wedding.<br /><br />Feeling the need to stop them, she is determined in going to \\"Sugar Rush\\" to kill the Cy-Bug and Felix, Jr. decides to accompany her.<br /><br />Meanwhile, on \\"Sugar Rush\\", as Vanellope uses the medal to purchase a new race vehicle.  As Vanellope plans to compete, the racers at \\"Sugar Rush\\" refuse to allow her to race, claiming that she is not part of their game and that she is nothing but a glitch/mistake and is not supposed to exist.<br /><br />Ralph finds out that she lives by herself and realizes like him, no one wants to be around her.  So, the two become good friends and Ralph is determined in seeing Vanellope win the race and prove to the others that she is real and that she is a winner.<br /><br />But when King Candy is determined that a glitch should not win the race, so he hack's the \\"Sugar Rush\\" code to get Ralph's medal and warning him that if Vanellope wins the race, it will be disastrous not just for \\"Sugar Rush\\" but can end up killing Vanellope as she was never meant to be part of the game and that is why she is glitching.  It could also cause problems to his own video game.<br /><br />But with Vanellope's heart set on winning the race with the car that she and Ralph had built... Will Ralph help Vanellope win the race or will he sabotage it?  And what will happen to the game he belongs to, now that he's not in it?<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Wreck-It Ralph: Ultimate Collector's Edition\\" is a film that looks incredible on Blu-ray.  Because of the way each video game setting is created, their is wonderful depth in the 3D presentation.  I have to say that this film is one of the better looking animated films in 3D.<br /><br />And as the Blu-ray 3D is quite impressive, the Blu-ray is also fantastic with its vibrant colors and its overall color palette.  Colors and detail are incredible, especially to see various video game characters animated and some with metallic to shiny textures, the animation for this film is fantastic.  You can see the detail on the character's skin tones to the textures of Sugar Rush, such as sugared candy hills, the textures of Ralph's clothing and more.<br /><br />And with a film with so much color, you would think that with pinks and reds, you would see banding.  This is not the case with \\"Wreck-It Ralph\\", this is a pristine looking film in HD and definitely one of the better, modern animated films on Blu-ray.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Wreck-It Ralph: Ultimate Collector's Edition\\" is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and DVS 2.0 Dolby Digital.  Let me just say that this is one of the most immersive soundtracks I have heard for an animated film.  The surround channels are heavily utilized during the action sequences, may it be the racers in \\"Sugar Rush\\" or the soldiers taking on the Cy-Bugs.  There is great use of directional, cross-panning sound and thunderous LFE that the film is immersive.<br /><br />Dialogue is crystal clear and understandable, as with the musical score by Henry Jackman to the \\"Sugar Rush\\" song by AKB48.  One of the best sounding animated films on Blu-ray!<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Wreck-It-Ralph: Ultimate Collector's Edition\\" come with the following special features:<br /><br />  Paperman: Theatrical Short - (6:34) For those who watched the film in the theater (in 3D or 2D), \\"Paperman\\" is a theatrical short and a love story about a man who sees the woman he fell in love at first sight and tries to get her attention at a building across from his, by throwing paper airplanes.  The short is featured in both 3D and 2D.<br />  Bit by Bit: Creating the Worlds of Wreck-It Ralph - (16:40) A featurette with director Rich Moore, Producer Clark Spencer and the \\"Wreck-It Ralph\\" crew discussing the development, design and animation of the film.<br />  Alternate and Deleted Scenes - (15:26)  Featuring a total of four deleted and alternate scenes (all are not fully-rendered but featured via animated sketches) with optional commentary from director Rich Moore, co-writers Phil Johnston and Jim Reardon.<br />  Video Game Commercials - (2:39) Promotional commercials for \\"Wreck-It Ralph\\" for \\"Fix-It Felix Jr.\\", \\"Sugar Rush\\", \\"Hero's Duty\\" and \\"Fix It Felix Hammer\\".<br />  Disney Intermission - (9:23) Whenever you pause \\"Wreck-It Ralph\\", comedian and \\"The Nerdist\\", \\"Talking Dead\\" and \\"Attack of the Show\\" host Chris Hardwick, discusses the video game references and Easter eggs featured in the film.<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"Wreck-It Ralph: Ultimate Collector's Edition\\" comes with a lenticular slipcover case and the Ultimate Collector's Edition comes with a Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, DVD (presented in 2:39:1 aspect ratio, English 5.1 and DVS 2.0 Dolby Digital, Spanish and French 5.1 Dolby Digital Language Tracks) and digital Copy, which works with iTunes and Windows Media Player.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />When I first watched \\"Wreck-It Ralph\\" in the theater and then watching it again on Blu-ray 3D/Blu-ray, there were so many things about this animated film that I loved.<br /><br />For one, it dealt with video games and featured video game character cameos throughout the film, it also featured a song from Japan's AKB48 but for the most part, the story was clever about characters having the ability to cross over to other video games (when an arcade is closed for the day).<br /><br />While not as deep or emotional compared to a Disney/Pixar film such as \\"Toy Story 3″ or \\"Up\\", the film is exciting, full of imagination, humorous and so much fun thanks  to its characters, character situations and for the most part, there are lessons to be learned from this film.<br /><br />For one, it's protagonist Ralph is a video game antagonist but he's a guy with a good heart, but because he's different from everyone else, people from his own video game, try to distance themselves from him.  Vanellope is also in the same situation, but it's how these two people viewed as different, find each other and become good friends despite the challenges they each face in their video game life.<br /><br />You also have the strong female soldier Sgt. Calhoun which is a pretty cool female character to be seen on an animated film.  She kicks butt but yet we learn that she is not a perfect video game character as she is trying to move past the death of her fiance (who was killed by Cy-Bugs because she failed to check the perimeter).  And then you have Felix, Jr., the hero of the old school \\"Fix-It Felix Jr.\\" video games with a magic hammer that can fix things and also a major crush towards Sgt. Calhoun.<br /><br />The voice acting of \\"Wreck-It Ralph\\" also benefits from having talents such as John C. Reilly, Sarah Silverman, Jack McBrayer and Jane Lynch in the main characters roles.  But you also have other talent such as Mindy Kailing, Joe Lo Truglio, Alan Tudyk, Ed O'Neill, Dennis Haysbert and many others as voice talent for the film.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, I have to say that this is one of the best, if not the best animated film to be presented in Blu-ray 3D.  Also, the Blu-ray itself features a colorful andvibrant scenery and full of detail.  Picture quality alone is fantastic and as for the lossless audio, definitely one of the better, immersive animated films on Blu-ray.  Solid PQ and AQ really makes this film worth owning in HD but if there was only one thing that I wished was on the Blu-ray release was more special features.  From the \\"Sugar Rush\\" video by AKB48 shown on YouTube on the \\"Wreck-It Ralph\\" channel, audio commentary or even more special features would have been nice.<br /><br />Granted, I  know I'm spoiled to expecting a lot from Disney animated films on Blu-ray as Disney tends to deliver.  And while there are a good number of special features in this \\"Ultimate Collector's Edition\\" of \\"Wreck-It Ralph\\", I was hoping to see many more and kind of takes it away from being a 5-star Blu-ray release.<br /><br />Overall, Enjoyable, hilarious and all out awesome!  \\"Wreck-It Ralph: Ultimate Collector's Edition\\" is possibly one of the best animated film on Blu-ray 3D released so far.

B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|In the early 1900′s, Scottish novelist and playwright J.M. Barrie would go on to create the character Peter Pan.<br /><br />First appearing in the 1902 novel \\"The Little White Bird\\", \\"Peter Pan\\" (a.k.a. \\"The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up\\") would be featured in a stage play in 1904, to be followed by a novel titled \\"Peter and Wendy\\" in 1911.<br /><br />For a  young Walt Disney, \\"Peter Pan\\" was one of Disney's favorite stories growing up and back in 1935, he originally intended for \\"Peter Pan\\" to be the second Disney animated film after \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\".  Problem was that it took a number of years for hi to get the rights from Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, which J.M. Barrie gave the rights to.<br /><br />And from the 1930′s and 1940′s, the film was being developed and many ideas for the storyline came into play, World War II would then delay \\"Peter Pan\\" into becoming an animated film as the U.S. military took control of the studio and had Disney working on propaganda films.<br /><br />But eventually after 30-years of planning and delays, in 1953, \\"Peter Pan\\" would become the 14th film in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series line and the $4 million dollar film would go to earn $87 million in the box office.  With several video releases, a 2002 sequel titled \\"Return to Never Land\\" and CG animated films featuring Tinker Bell having been released on Blu-ray, \\"Peter Pan: Diamond Edition\\" was released in HD on Blu-ray for the very first time in February 2013.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Peter Pan\\" is one of the most wonderful looking animated films that still looks magnificent 60-years-later.  The artwork is highly regarded by artists and although not realistic, you get a feel of a painted style, a brilliant artistic use of paint in animation brought to Disney's attention. The film was in development for over two decades and the overall look of the film is even more impressive on Blu-ray.<br /><br />\\"Peter Pan: Diamond Edition\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:33:1).  The colors are vibrant, the blacks are nice and deep and the character designs and animation look absolutely cute but also its lines are absolute clean.  But it's how the artistic backgrounds and foregrounds compliments the animation is quite amazing!<br /><br />\\"Peter Pan\\" has never looked this magnificent and I am impressed by how much of an upgrade this film looks compared to its previously awesome Platinum DVD release only four years ago.  There is no compression artifacts, no banding, no scratches or dust, it looks perfect!<br /><br />If you love this film, you definitely need to upgrade to Blu-ray because \\"Peter Pan\\" looks fantastic in HD!<br /><br />Because the film is presented in 1:33:1, once again, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment brings back the \\"DisneyView\\" featuring the art of Cristy Maltese, so instead of the black bars on the side, you can opt for colorful artwork that matches the scenes of the film.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Peter Pan: Diamond Edition\\" is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD High Resolution Audio and also French and Spanish Dolby Digital  Language Tracks.  It's important to note that Disney chose to go with High Resolution audio over lossless DTS-HD Master Audio.  But the audio is still fantastic as the music sounds so much crisper than it has ever sound before.<br /><br />The soundtrack is not totally immersive, but there is good use of the surround channels during the action portions of the film.  Needless to say, this is a wonderful lossless high resolution soundtrack and the best I have heard of \\"Peter Pan\\".<br /><br />As for subtitles, subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Peter Pan: Diamond Edition\\" come with the following special features:<br /><br />  Storybook App - An app for your children to access coloring pages, puzzles, music, memory games and more.<br />  Disney Intermission - Anytime you watch the film and presspause, you get a random interactive moment during the menu pause.<br />  Introduction - (1:09) Featuring an introduction by Diane Disney Miller.<br />  Disney View - While watching the film, you can add Disney View on the sides of the film featuring the artwork of painter Cristy Maltese.<br />  Growing Up with Nine Old Men - (41:08) Walt's original nine artists for Disney is well-known.

A boy who never wanted to grow up, Neverland and the battle between Peter and Captain Hook is known to Disney fans.  But during the time that \\"Peter Pan\\" was being developed by Walt Disney, suffice to say that \\"Peter Pan\\" was a story that captivated many readers and those who watched the play during the first half of the 20th century.<br /><br />The film captures the innocence of children and the wanting of staying young, so you don't have to grow up and worry about the things that teenagers or adults do.  But \\"Peter Pan\\" is also a film that showcases the classic Disney era that showcases amazing use of color, art background with tremendous detail.  Audiences were entertained by this animated film as it continued the visual artistry of the crew who worked on Disney films at that time.<br /><br />While the animated film differs from its counterpart featured in the novels and the storyline was not as deep, it was an animated film that people needed to see.  Especially several years after World War II, people wanted to be entertained and not necessarily needing something deep or emotional.  The story was kept simple but yet, you are captivated by the film because whether you are a child or a child at heart, it's that adventure of being a child and experiencing a magical world is quite fun. A lot of us have felt that moment where you know your child years are ending and not wanting to grow up.  So, one can easily understand the characters of this film, but also enjoy the adventures of Peter Pan, Wendy, her brothers and the Lost Boys.<br /><br />For those of us who grew up with the film, the film is nostalgic.  Sure, not everyone will be pleased.  As there are some who are very critical of how the Native Americans were portrayed in the film and then there are those who see characters to be sexist.  Tinker Bell as the vindictive, jealous female who will go as far to have Wendy killed because she doesn't like women around Peter Pan.<br /><br />But this where good parenting comes in, to help children understand how times have changed and explain to them about it.  Some can cry foul and how these classic film can be pushed off as entertainment for children, but once again, these classic animated films were a product of its time.  Because there will be many films, from silent films, classic animated film to top films from the '50s and '60s and even films made today that people will find a problem with certain content.  It's about knowing what is right or wrong and teaching your children and having them learn from it.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, the Walt Disney stamp of approval of releasing these classic films in the best quality as possible continues with \\"Peter Pan: Diamond Edition\\", the film looks absolutely pristine in HD.  There is nothing about the film that makes you think it was created before 1953.  The colors are vibrant, there are no blemishes that can be seen.<br /><br />I know that with the \\"Platinum Edition\\", there were some who felt the picture quality was changed slightly but from my own personal viewing, the film looked colorful, detail of the backgrounds and environments looked amazing and I saw no problems with artifacts or banding.  The film looked fantastic!  And that goes with the audio as well.  And for a Diamond Edition release, you would expect a plethora of special features and you do get a good number.  Some that are new and many from the past release.<br /><br />Growing up, \\"Peter Pan\\" and \\"Captain Hook\\" were classic characters that showcased good vs. evil.  While I enjoyed the film as a child, I must admit that it is not the most memorable Disney film nor is it a film that I watch often.  I know that my wife enjoyed the film and can remember lyrics to the songs to this day, but for me it was more about nostalgia and watching it again with our child, who enjoyed the film.<br /><br />The animation for \\"Peter Pan\\" still holds up to this day and with this Blu-ray release, I'm quite pleased with the Diamond Edition as it continues to carry the quality that Disney has done previously with their Walt Disney Animated Classics series on Blu-ray and really giving fans what they want in terms of pristine picture quality, crisp lossless audio and a plethora of special features.<br /><br />For fans of this Walt Disney Animated Classic, \\"Peter Pan\\" will continue to entertain children and people today and tomorrow, as the film has done for the last 60-years.  And in the case of \\"Peter Pan: Diamond Edition\\" on Blu-ray, it's the definitive version of the film to own!  Highly recommended!y of \\"Peter Pan\\" is classic.

B00AFEYUVG|4.0|feel infinite.<br /><br />In 1999, American novelist Stephen Chbosky would write the coming-of-age novel \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" which was published by MTV.<br /><br />Considered a modern classic and having received a cult following, over a decade later, Mr. Mudd Productions (producers of the film \\"Juno\\") approached Chbosky (who had gone on to write for and produced TV series such as \\"Jericho\\" and \\"Rent\\") for a screen adaptation of his novel.  Produced by John Malkovich, Lianne Halfon and Russell Smith, the producers also hired Chbosky to direct the film.<br /><br />And by 2011, wanting to find the right cast for his novel, actors Logan Lerman (\\"3:10 to Yuma\\", \\"Percy Jackson & the Olympians\\", \\"The Number 23″) and Emma Watson (\\"Harry Potter\\" films, \\"My Week with Marilyn\\") were the first to confirmed talent to play the characters of Charlie and Sam.<br /><br />The film would be released in the fall of 2012 and garner positive reviews from film critics.

From the scenes of Sam standing on a truck going through the freeway tunnel, to the group enjoying \\"Rocky Horror Picture Show\\" or just  hanging out at a friends house and having fun, the film looks very good in HD.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" is presented in English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and Espanol Dolby Digital 5.1.  While dialogue and music is crystal clear, the lossless soundtrack is purely dialogue and music driven with a few instances of crowd ambiance being utilized in class, at the dance, parties, etc.  But for a film like this, the lossless soundtrack was appropriate.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English, English SDH and Espanol.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" come with the following special features:<br /><br />  Audio Commentary 1 - Featuring audio commentary by writer/director Stephen Chbosky.  And discussing differences from his novel and the film version but also why he became a novelist.<br />  Audio Commentary 2 - Featuring a commentary by writer/director Stephen Chbosky, Logan Lerman, Ezra Miller, Johnny Simmons, Emma Watson, Mae Whitman and Erin Wilhelm.

Also included is a Digital Copy which works with iTunes and also a slipcover case.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Typically, whenever I encounter a film that is made today and is set in the '80s or '90s, I roll my eyes, because for some reason, the director's try too hard or seem to have forgotten the fashion or the music of that time period.  And when it tries to focus too much on the pop culture of that era, it fails miserably.<br /><br />But when I found out that \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\", a popular novel by Stephen Chbosky, was being made into the film and was being written and directed by him, suffice to say, the film version was in good hands.<br /><br />Having watched the film, I don't know how thrilled I was after watching it, having grown up during this era and understand the music references but most of all, trying not too hard to be an early '90s film but leaving it to the viewer to know when it was set, everything worked out perfectly.<br /><br />But it's the casting that let to the efficacy of \\"The Perks of Being a Wall Flower\\".  The three main talents in the film, Logan Lerman, Emma Watson and Ezra Miller were wonderfully cast.  Yes, I know Time Magazine's Richard Corliss was not too thrilled about 20-year-olds being cast as teenagers but for this film, these young talent look so young that they can pass as teenagers quite easily.<br /><br />What I enjoyed about this film is that this is no perfect set of teenagers that live happy lives.  These teenagers seem themselves as a group of misfits.  Charlie is a teenager who is shy, always bullied, never had many friends but also a past that he is starting to discover through flashbacks in his mind.<br /><br />But because he enjoys his friends, never was a judgmental person and takes things how the way they are, it's what makes him special because he's a genuine person that listens, cares despite being living a life of loneliness.<br /><br />His friends Sam, is beautiful but also a person who wants to change her life around.  Not being this girl who has reputation of sleeping around with men but when she meets Charlie, for the first time, a guy respects her and doesn't care about her past or what life she had lived.  He respects her for what she is now and it's one thing that she has never experienced from a person.<br /><br />And there is Patrick, the class clown, he does get into trouble a bit, but within his friends, he cares for them deeply.  He also is a homosexual in a secret relationship with the quarterback of the football team.<br /><br />And the things that these characters deal with and what makes them awkward and why they don't fit in with the popular cliques but yet, they have their own group of wallflowers and it's this friendship that keeps them going.<br /><br />While I did have reservations of Chbosky directing the film (because his experience is writing for novels and television), there is no one in this world that could have brought this film to the big screen except him.  Just listening to his audio commentary and the special features, things had to be right in this film.  From the casting to overall chemistry and the vision he had for this film essentially came to life because the tone he set for his talent but also letting them live together during the filming of the movie and in that process, he realized he had something special.<br /><br />From the supporting characters within the wallflower group to the adults featured in the film, he wanted a family atmosphere and in the end, he was able to get amazing chemistry from the young talent and this film shows how that chemistry works amazingly well.<br /><br />And while the film does have its differences from the book, there were things added on this Blu-ray.  For example, the poem that was featured in the book.  Chbosky knew that the poem would not make it into the film, but he shot it anyway and included it on the Blu-ray.  Scenes that involve Charlie's parents to an extended scene of the prom photos.  Chbosky knew that the young talent never experienced the prom before, because of their careers.  So, he wanted them to experience the feel of a prom, photos and everything, for their benefit to have that experience.<br /><br />Rarely do you see a filmmaker go all out for their talent like this, but he understood the chemistry of his young talent but also knowing things that fans of the novel would probably like to see on the Blu-ray, so, there are couple of special features plus audio commentary that fans of the film will enjoy.<br /><br />And picture quality and the lossless soundtrack is very good on Blu-ray and for the most part, I think that fans of the film should be quite pleased with this release.<br /><br />Overall, \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" is fantastic film, wonderful adaptation of Chbosky's novel and great casting.  Logan Lerman, Emma Watson and Ezra Miller are absolutely wonderful chemistry and it's a coming-of-age film that I highly recommend!riends, he cares for them deeply.

B00A4W3AJC|5.0|For cineaste, many are calling \\"Holy Motors\\", directed by Leos Carax (\\"The Lovers on the Bridge\\", \\"Mauvais sang\\", \\"Boy Meets Girl\\") as a true masterpiece!<br /><br />Cahiers du Cinema voted the \\"Holy Motors\\" as the #1 film of 2012.<br /><br />Richard Brody of \\"The New Yorker\\" praised the film writing, \\"These images and sounds that reveal the mind in matter and the soul in bodies suggest Carax's ultimate definition of the cinema, and it's one of the best and grandest that a movie has ever offered.\\"<br /><br />For French cinema, as names such as Jean Renoir, Jean-Luc Godard, Francois Truffaut, Eric Rohmer, Claude Chabrol, Andre Bazin, Jacques Rivette (to name a few) are highly regarded for their part in cinema that was know as the \\"French New Wave\\", Leos Carax is one who was influenced by it, especially the works of Godard.<br /><br />And similar to Godard who worked with Anna Karina, Jean-Paul Belmondo or Jean-Pierre Leaud, Carax would work with Juliette Binoche and Denis Lavant.<br /><br />While his last film was back in 1999 with \\"Pola X\\" and taking part in a segment for the film \\"Tokyo!\\" in 2008, it was the latter in which he worked against with Denis Lavant, that Leos wanted to create a film written specifically with Lavant in mind.  It took five years for Leos to find funding for the film and sure enough was able to get funding from companies in France and Germany.<br /><br />And now this critically acclaimed film will be released on Blu-ray courtesy of Indomina in Feb. 2013.<br /><br />I will first say that describing this film doesn't do any justice. \\"Holy Motors\\" is a film that must be experienced and watched against due to its complexity and the fact that cineaste may find references or find something profound with each segment.  And each segment features actor Denis Lavant in multiple roles.<br /><br />But the film begins with a character known as \\"Le Dormeur\\" who awakens and finds a secret door in his apartment where he ends up in a theater where people are watching King Vidor's \\"The Crowd\\" and surreal imagery begins with a young child and a very large dog walks around the aisle.<br /><br />We are then introduced to Oscar, a man who rides in a white limousine driven by Celine (portrayed by Edith Scob).  While she drives him to multiple appointments, Oscar's job involves wearing makeup and costumes and performing various scenarios, not on stage or for the big screen but what appears to be reality (or is it?).<br /><br />One scene involves Oscar in character wearing a motion capture suit and meeting up with a woman also wearing a motion capture suit and the two engaging in a simulated sex scene while motion capture is recording their movements.  We watch as Oscar then dresses up as the sewer troll Monsieur Merde (which was originally featured in the film \\"Tokyo!\\").<br /><br />During a model photoshoot with model Kay M (portrayed by Eva Mendes), he captures her and brings her down to his cave/sewer where he begins eating the contents in her purse and her hair.  But he then begins to modify her dress towards his own sense of fashion.<br /><br />Another sequence includes Oscar playing a father who picks up his daughter from a party, to be told of how much fun she was having until he catches her in a lie.  And he finds out in reality, no guys want to party with her and he begins to question why she isn't attracting any guys.<br /><br />Another sequences features Oscar as a man who murders another man.  But when he shaves the man's beard, the man turns out to look exactly like the person who is responsible for the murder.<br /><br />Another sequence involves meeting up with an old flame, Eva (portrayed by Kylie Minogue) and the two going out to talk to each other and reminisce of the past.<br /><br />We see many more appointments as Oscar takes part in a man who is dying, a musical, a gangster and many more.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Holy Motors\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1) and to bring costs down, despite not being known to work with digital film (and even a character mentioning big film cameras being missed), shot with an Red Epic camera, the cinematography by Caroline Champetier (\\"Tokyo!\\", \\"Of Gods and Men\\", \\"Ponette\\") is gorgeous!  The film is well-contrast and because every sequence is difference, scenes such as the motion capture scene to scenes visiting various areas in France is quite beautiful to see.  The film is well-contrast and I didn't detect an aliasing, banding or artifacts during my viewing of the film.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Holy Motors\\" is presented in French Dolby Digital 5.1 and French stereo.  I was a bit surprised as the Artificial Eye release features a French DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 lossless soundtrack, but I went to confirm on my receiver to see if its DTS-HD MA 5.1 but it shows up as Dolby digital 5.1.  For the most part, the 5.1 soundtrack does offer much more dynamic range than the stereo track.  Dialogue and music are crystal clear and I detected no pops or hiss during my viewing of the film.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Holy Motors\\" come with the following special features:<br /><br />  Drive In: Making of Holy Motors - (47:28) A featurette on the behind-the-scenes making of \\"Holy Motors\\".<br />  Kylie Minogue - (13:22) Kylie Minogue is interviewed on how she was cast for the film and her impressions of \\"Holy Motors\\".<br />  Trailer - Featuring two trailers (2:32) and (1:51).<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"Holy Motors\\" is what I would call profound cinema.<br /><br />Cinema intended to make one think, complex to make one re-watch and entertaining because of how audacious and surprising the film is.<br /><br />Is the film intended to be a message from filmmaker Leos Carax or is this a tribute to cinema and each segment/appointment featured in the film is a tribute to other cinema?  Was the character of Celine wearing a mask as homage to Georges Franju's 1960 film \\"Les yeux sans visage\\" (Eyes without a Face)?  Was Kylie Minogue's Eva Grace modeled after actress Jean Seberg, best known for starring in Jean-Luc Godard's 1960 film \\"A bout de souffle\\" (Breathless)?  Was the musical inspired from \\"The Umbrella's of Cherbourg\\"?  Or what about the scene with chimps was that a homage to the Charlotte Rampling film, \\"Max Mon Amour\\"?<br /><br />We see references to Carax' previous work such as the motion capture sequence that is reminiscent to a scene in \\"Mauvais Sang\\", a limo scene reminiscent of a scene from \\"Boy Meets Girl\\", the beggar from \\"Les amants du Pont-Neuf\\" (The Lovers on the Bridge) and we also see the hideous Monsieur Merde of \\"Tokyo!\\" making his appearance.<br /><br />I watched \\"Holy Motors\\" and my feeling was that Leos Carax, in going digital for this film, it was a homage but also like a somber goodbye to cinema of the past.  I have no question in my mind that the film contains imagery and situations and possibly a form of communication from Carax of how he feels about society, about himself, about cinema.<br /><br />But that is what I see in this amazing film.  Segments that provide something new, unique and you can't help but wanting to watch it again and again to see what you got out of it.<br /><br />It's quite amazing of how he constructed a character that is an actor that takes his acting not on stage or movies but to actual settings in Paris.  There is no need to ask if this segment was real or if it was imaginary, the point of the film is to make one think, to make one entertained and to escape the banalities of modern cinema.  Being creative, imaginative and a hint of an Elegiac.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality is fantastic but I do question the choice of going Dolby Digital 5.1 instead of DTS-HD MA like the European Artificial Eye release.  But with that being said, both are different in terms of special features with thie Indomina release featuring a making of and an interview with Kylie Minogue.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Holy Motors\\" is breath of fresh air, something unique and different when compared to today's modern cinema and possibly a film that many consider as filmmaker Leos Carax' Magnum Opus.  Entertaining, complex and wonderful!film \\"Les yeux sans visage\\" (Eyes without a Face)?

But with that being said, both are different in terms of special features with thie Indomina release featuring a making of and an interview with Kylie Minogue.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Holy Motors\\" is breath of fresh air, something unique and different when compared to today's modern cinema and possibly a film that many consider as filmmaker Leos Carax' Magnum Opus.  Entertaining, complex and wonderful!

A good amount of grain, wonderful detail when it comes to closeups, especially seeing the makeup design in order to make Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis have facial similarities.  Colors look natural, there is good amount of detail throughout the film, may it be skin detal, weapon detail or clothing in general, there is amazing detail and clarity with this film.  And videophiles should be pleased of how awesome \\"Looper\\" looks on Blu-ray!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />And as one expects from an action film, \\"Looper\\" is immersive!  Presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA and an English Audio Descriptive track, everything from ambience to the many gunfire and shotgun rifle blasts sound amazingly clear through the surround channels.  Dialogue is crystal clear, music is also clear and showcase really good bass.  But it's the amount of gunfire that is prominently displayed throughout the film.  Amazing lossless soundtrack and those who have the hardware to showcase the lossless audio, will be pleased!<br /><br />Subtitles are in English, English SDH and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Looper\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Audio Commentary - Featuring a very informative audio commentary with director/writer Rian Johnson and actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Emily Blunt.<br />  Deleted Scenes- (36:50) Featuring 22 deleted and extended scenes with optional commentary from director/writer Rian Johnson and actor Noah Segan.  Seventeen deleted scenes are Blu-ray exclusives.<br />  The Future from the Beginning - (7:52) A featurette featuring the cast and crew talking about the making of \\"Looper\\", the use of prosthetics and makeup design to make Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis look similar and more!<br />  The Science of Time Travel - (8:29) A Blu-ray exclusive. Author Brian Clegg (\\"How to Build a Time Machine\\" discusses time travel and the rules of time travel.<br />  Scoring Looper - (16:18) Composer Nathan Johnson (brother of director Rian Johnson) talks about the field recordings, percussion and melodic instruments.<br />  Looper Animated Trailer - (1:34) An animated trailer for \\"Looper\\".<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"Looper\\" comes with an UltraViolet code which allows you to download the movie to your computer and select Apple and Android devices and stream to computers, tables or smartphones. Also, included is a slipcover case.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />There are many films about time travel, sentimental to action-driven films.  And part of the challenge of a writer is to create a sci-fi action film without being too banal.<br /><br />Fortunately, writer/director Rian Johnson has crafted an intriguing sci-fi action film in which time travel is banned in the future and also a future that has been taken over by criminal organizations and 10% of the society which has gained special telekinetic (TK)) powers.<br /><br />It sounds so far out of left field and I admit being a bit skeptical when I first saw the trailer for this film, but having watched the film now, I realize that Johnson has crafted and original and unique storyline that I never expected to see, and the fact that it was so different, exciting and provided an action-packed storyline but wasn't filled with too much action or special effects and integrated a fascinating storyline made \\"Looper\\" a film that was much better than what I was expecting.<br /><br />In this day and age of special effects and popcorn action films, the whole entire concept of criminal organizations using time machines for illegal purposes, especially transporting people targeted for assassinations through a time machine from 2074 to 2044 for execution by Loopers was interesting.<br /><br />But it's the actual meeting of present and future Joe that is surprising.  Most films tend to show a present and future version of themselves, working together for the greater good.  Considering that present Joe (portrayed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a criminal and that future Joe (portrayed by Bruce Willis) is a former criminal thanks to his loving wife who changed him, it's a different take because it becomes criminal vs. criminal but who in the end will be on top?<br /><br />While future Joe has changed to become a better man, it's the fact that he has come back to the past to kill the \\"Rain Maker\\" that makes the story quite interesting because the \\"Rain Maker\\" in 2044 is a young child.  And because he doesn't know which child will be the Rain Maker, he goes after three addresses to kill all children.  This reminds you of \\"The Terminator\\" when The Terminator goes to all addresses killing anyone named Sarah Conner but it's hard to sympathize with future Joe because he's going to kill innocent children for his \\"greater good\\" (no rain maker, no tyranny.  No rain maker, his wife survives).<br /><br />While present Joe just wants to kill his future self but when he finds out the boy he is protecting or has become friends with is the \\"Rain Maker\\", especially in Damian-esque fashion of a child that exceeds the 10% TK threshold and can have a human being explode, suffice to say, these are situations that I never expected to see for this film.<br /><br />And it's those unexpected twists that made \\"Looper\\" so entertaining!<br /><br />Joseph Gordon-Levitt has become an actor in recent years that gets better and better and as for Bruce Willis, he's one of the best action stars of all time!  Jeff Daniels moment in the film is quite short, but Emily Blunt was wonderful as the single mother and interesting to see Piper Perabo in her first nude prostitute scene.  But \\"Looper\\" features a solid cast who did a great job in the film!<br /><br />And as for the Blu-ray release, picture quality and lossless audio are fantastic!  There are a good number of special features included but if anything stayed in my head during my viewing of this film, it's the immersive soundtrack with gunshots galore and the wonderful makeup design and prosthetic use of trying to make Levitt look closer to Bruce Willis.<br /><br />Overall, Rian Johnson's \\"Looper\\" is an exciting sci-fi action film with a clever storyline with many twists and turns.  And on Blu-ray, the film looks and sounds incredible.  Recommended!e \\"Looper\\" a film that was much better than what I was expecting.<br /><br />In this day and age of special effects and popcorn action films, the whole entire concept of criminal organizations using time machines for illegal purposes, especially transporting people targeted for assassinations through a time machine from 2074 to 2044 for execution by Loopers was interesting.<br /><br />But it's the actual meeting of present and future Joe that is surprising.

B00BVYKWJI|5.0|Excellent acting one and all.  Made us feel we were right there, just hiding behind a screen!  A history lesson that will always stick in my head from now on.  Wish those historic lessons had always been this way, years ago.  Whoever thought this up, and  put this story on the screen, is brilliant.  Thanks for the pleasure.
B00122HU44|5.0|Love the variety of the tunes.  The playing is great as always.  Will be in rotation for a while. Thanks MK!
B004K58GSO|4.0|A good old fashioned western.  The good guys won over the bad guys.  One of the good guys had some personal issues to<br /><br />overcome but right triumphed in the end.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Love Baldacci --rarely misses. This one is no exception. I hope the character comes back in another book. Recommend highly
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|The book was well written and the characters were great although a little unbelievably good and brave!  I found it very depressing.  The author did try to give meaning to their lives, however short.  I'm not sure it would be great for teenagers.  i would be hesitant to recommend it to one.  The Book Thief, also written for teenagers, i would not hesitate to recommend to young people. So read it first before you give it to a young person
B003QS9TKU|5.0|My mother and I used to watch this together. It is such a cute story and I love the animation in the middle.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This is first of Nicholas Sparks' books I have read. His style takes some getting used to. That said, the story kept my interest throughout. I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 for the inclusion of violence without pre-warning.
B0067R0APK|1.0|I'll not sure why there has to be a difference between the iphone app android, but the format is so foreign and difficult. Adding insult to injury, selecting one of the radars gives you a blank screen to watch. My ipad now has an updated version that is awful in other ways,  hating the a dificult clock like format. Why are .they doing this? Glad it was only $0.99
B009UX2YAC|5.0|subway suffers is an amazing game and its really fun for all age my 5yr. old sister plays it and my 18 yr. old brother plays it.
B005H9B44A|4.0|Great effects and a decent story line. Probably not an Academy Award, but it sure was fun. Good heroic message.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Nice app.  Provides amble choices for the right background noise.  I am looking forward to additional choices and features in the future.

B0042TV4IW|5.0|This is what I wanted to watch every evening before I went to bed!  I don't want to watch depressing movies before bedtime!!<br />It's fun, has a lot of twists and turns & lots of different types of relationships, etc.  I highly recommend it!
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is like so addictive when u start to play that u can't stop the only thing I don't like is that when it starts to get good u have to get the full version
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I really enjoy playing JS. It is fast paced and a challenge! I have played many<br />Match - 3 games and Jewels Star is among the best.
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|Got this because my kids love Peter Pan. It's a great story portrayed in in a beautiful movie. Good actors and not too scary for my kids.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is great. It is fun and entertaining. Just as you think you are getting to the end, a whole other level pops up.  5 stars!!!!!
B0037QM8YA|1.0|but the video streaming was horrible.  While I played this video stream my router at home was streaming at a high speed, but for some reason the video kept pausing.  I had to reset this video to replay at least 10 times. Horrible.  I don't think I will be renting from Amazon again.

0143121006|5.0|Paul French writes, \\"Helen Foster Snow dressed smartly-high heels, long skirts, fur stoles. Her style was radical politics and chic couture.\\" You can see more period photos of China, the political players surrounding Pamela Werner, including a shot of three young boys as members of Chiang Kai-shek's Blue Shirt Youth Corps, and Helen Snow herself in front of her house down the alley from the Werner's in BRIDGING: A PHOTO ESSAY ON THE LIFE OF HELEN FOSTER SNOW, available in paperback from Brigham Young University Book Store.  Even more scary than the photos, the caption under a hand drawn map of her house in relation to the landmarks that French cites as well, \\"...map of the Snow's house near the Fox Tower, their residence from the fall of 1935 to November, 1937....a house haunted by werefoxes, lost and desperate students, and refugees from Manchuria.\\"

B0099Y2YL6|4.0|Now my lady can watch the series again whenever she wants.  We have all three seasons and hope for several more.
B0089XH38M|5.0|I have this on all our computers and digital devices. It's one of the best anti Virus' out there. Wouldn't run a system with out it.

B007HC3LHS|1.0|I've never reviewed a book before but this is the worst book I've ever tried to read. Very confusing.  Started over numerous times but could not get past the first couple of chapters.
1857885082|5.0|I am English but have lived abroad for the last 7 years. I spent my first few years away from England believing I was weird and struggling to understand other people's motivations. That was until I read this book. It turns out I'm not weird, I'm just English! This book honestly helped me understand so much about myself and my friends and family. If there is an English person in your life that you find ever so slightly odd you need to read this book.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a great April to have if you're like me,,and forecast to pay attention to your battery. This is a MUST-HAVE
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After watching the first movie I read all 3 books within 2 weeks.  An excellent effort at finding actors/actresses to mirror the characters in the book.  We cant wait for the next movie !
B006VFLIYK|3.0|interesting plot, keeps you riveted.  However, the coincidences needed and the synchronization of required movements of the characters was often incredulous.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Can't stop playing. Want to keep trying to see how far I can get. I love the cars and the beach so this game is perfect for me
B007THA4FI|4.0|I was impressed with the sophistication of the characters. A very different voice from 'Harry Potter'.<br /><br />I would love more books like this from JK Rowling
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|a fun filled game that is not to hard to play. and easy to do. I recamend this game to everyone that I know to play this.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|We love Downton Abbey and have watched the complete series non-stop over a weekend.<br /><br />As soon as Season 4 is available we'll pre-order it just as we did Season 3
B002VECM6S|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. We watch it over and over again. Every time we watch it, I see something different.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Very fun and easy to get into. Shame you have to wait for lives, otherwise would play this for hours!
B0067EKY7M|4.0|A lover of fish and a corporate representative take on the dream of a Sheikh to have a green valley with spawning fish. Love interspersed throughout.
B005HEDIHG|5.0|This is the best Star Trek Ever and the remastered version is wonderful!!!  It's so great it's on Prime.  Amazon Prime is the best!!!
0525953728|5.0|This was a great book i really enjoyed it. I will read it over and over again. I will also share it.
B00871C09S|5.0|This is one of my favorite Jimmy Stewart movies. I like the idea of watching all the different lives unfold and the suspense. I like suspenseful movies not gory horror movies.
B00BL5EQLC|4.0|If you've ever played Granny Smith then this game will seem familiar to you.<br /><br />Unlike Granny Smith, however, you swipe to control your actions rather than press one of two buttons and there are more total actions available to you.<br /><br />The graphics look nice, and it runs smoothly on my Galaxy S3.<br /><br />Not bad for half price, and an easy impulse decision when it's free.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love it so much and I play ops in real life and I watch ops on youtube and I wish that I have the hub to watch the show.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Overall a very good game. It's fun for all ages. I do find myself playing this more than my kid.
B007704HO6|5.0|This true account of a marginalized man and the homeless cat who gives him the hope and the reason to carry on is nothing short of inspiring.  Bob and James' story is heartwarming, uplifting, and utterly captivating.  It is an easy read, but don't let that put you off.  You will come away from this with a greater understanding of the plight of the homeless, and it just might make you a better person.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Very playable and well put together. Pace is slow, won't overwhelm. Plus, there are dinosaurs.<br />Tutorial could be better. The instructions are sparse.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Ditch the stock keyboard.  Swiftkey is a winner.  It actually learns the way that I type.  Mistakes are minimal.  Key size is perfect on my S3.  Simply the best keyboard that I have used.
B00005N6KG|4.0|I can't wear ear buds so I ordered this for listening to music while I run. It fits well and is comfortable to wear. I have worn it on 3-4 mile runs without any issues.
B004LWZW88|5.0|The return match up of Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek is perfect in this movie. A very enjoyable and family oriented story, with the added treat of details that cat lovers will surely relate to during many parts of the movie. The Blu-Ray version is the best, it brings all the characters to life in grand HD detail. Surely one movie you'll watch many times or play  as background noise just for the fun dialogue of the characters.
B005PK553C|4.0|I was hooked from the start.  This is an edge of your seat series.  Cant wait for season 2 to be offered free with my Prime Account.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|Why write about something so sad with an unbelievable ending.  Leave all this to real life.  The pain for the mother was as she showed unbearable.
B008P3SPVU|4.0|Wish it had not distorted the history.  The principle was behind the coach from the beginning.  Good stories don't have to be exaggerated to make them good stories.
B00064WSNW|4.0|I like all the tracks on this cd it has a feeling of the original King Crimson, very good musically and as I said typical Crimson so you will not be dissapointed.
B00BI73CVI|1.0|First of all it was not a musical, it was an opera.<br />The actors were not singers.  You could tell the difference between the people who were singers, and the actors who just sang.<br />Anne Hathaway did not deserve an academy award just because she allowed them to cut her hair.  I didn't even relate to her character.  None of the characters were developed or likable.  It was like a mosaic of Victor Hugo's magnificent novel.  I am not sure who understands this movie.  I read the book, which is marvellous, and this movie is just an intellectual attempt at trying to look smart.<br /><br />BTW, what was with the little boy in the French revolution speaking with an English accent?  seriously!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK! It's not often that I say that,but I really did love this book. Definitely read this book, you won't regret it :)

B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|This is the best game in the app store . It is very awesome! Woo woo woo it  is awesome
B005B0QYMM|5.0|Awesome movie for anyone who loves ghosts or horror movies. Great for a indie film. Just dont get your hopes up about the sequel
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|It's unfortunate that &#34;Fade Into You&#34; is missing from this album. Otherwise, it is a great offering and show just how good the music on the TV show is.
B009VMN3RA|3.0|I came away confused as to whether Shirley MacLaine was  a good Mom or not.  Her daughter sounds a little more together than her Mom  does.  I wish Sachi the best.  Not too happy I read the book.
B00AGKHFCA|5.0|We love Andrea Bocelli and have most of his music.  This is a lovely album with songs we like and we also saw the PBS program version entitled &#34;Love in Portofino&#34; and enjoyed that as well.
B006T5C5PS|5.0|Excellent reading. Educates on how to prevent and in some cases cure diseases. Served to increase my efforts to become vegan.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|We are fans of Josh Groban and enjoy most of his music.  This album has many lovely songs and we enjoy listening to them in our car as we drive.
1852424672|4.0|I bought this book based on a radio interview with the author.  It is somewhat a cross between an exploration of the minds of the Columbine shooters and the possible impact of the mother's personality on a son's behavior.<br /><br />The voice of the book is a little confusing at first, but you quickly get use to it.  It draws you in slowly because some of the characters are not likeable.  However, overall, this is memorable book.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is the most fascinating story.  It is one that just keeps you going all though the book and is so intriguing.  A definite must read.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|best apps on my phone.....very challenging. my kids love it...wish I could give it a ten star...hats the pop up ads...
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I watch very little network TV but this show is worth watching, even if on the TV and wading through the ads.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it! A great story of love and survival. Can't wait to read what happens next. Page turner. Great read.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I really enjoyed the book. It was very thought-provoking and kept me reading. The author is an excellent writer. Recommend!
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Not 100% free......I hate it when they say it's \\"free\\" and it really isn't.<br />That really sucks :( Cheap move....
0307165485|5.0|A classic from my childhood, and now I'm giving it to my niece for her to enjoy! I love it!
B002SRQ214|5.0|Had a Athlon X2 5200+ OC'ed to 3.1 GHZ and couldnt effectively render 1080p video in Adobe Premiere Elements 11. Popped in the Phenom X4 965 BE (at stock clock speed) and it rendered video in a blaze of glory. This thing is fast. I am able to run the new Tomb Raider on high settings even with an old video card ( Radeon HD 4670 1gb 128bit) & 4gb of GSkill DDR2 800  ram @ 5-5-5-12. Right around 40fps during high detail scenes. Great CPU and even sweeter deal.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|So much better then the movie.Please read the trilogy before you see the rest of these movies. The third one is a slow start but still good.

0062082353|5.0|This is a great book written by an American hero who tragically met death attempting to help a fellow soldier.
0670026603|5.0|When I first heard about Me Before You, I had misgivings.  I thought a love story between the quadriplegic and his caregiver was going to depress the hell out of me.  But swayed by all the buzz, my curiosity got the better of me and I had to pick up a copy.<br /><br />I read it in one night.  I laughed so hard at times that I probably woke up my neighbors.  But yes, towards the end, my heart was wrenched and twisted and tears freely streaming.  But it wasn't depressing - Me Before You made me sad but also hopeful.  It made me think about my own life, if I'd lived enough, if I had broadened my horizons enough, what regrets would I have if I was suddenly paralyzed - and of course, the biggie, what would I do if faced with a life of such diminished physical capacity.  Would I contemplate suicide?  Would I support someone I love in that situation?  These are very intense questions which Me Before You raises but no character on either side of the question(s) is cast villainously or unfairly.<br /><br />Yes, these are heavy issues but don't let that deter you from reading this wonderful, joyous book.  I fell in love with Louisa Clark - ordinary, inexperienced, but so bright and funny and full of life.  I doubt anyone wouldn't be inspired, or be charmed, by her.  And I just adored her family - made me want to be adopted!  Every single one was a colorful character.<br /><br />I can already tell that Me Before You is the book I will be pressing on strangers' hands to read this year.
0470876417|5.0|Excellent book, well written, well diagramed with easy to follow templates.  Perhaps not new, but the appraoch and the methodology make it excellent
B001B6EAOY|4.0|I used it in my camcorder. It had to be formated at first; I inserted two (2) 64 GB micros for a grand total of 128 GB I was concerned at first that it wouldn't work. It recorded fine with a disclaimer that's all. I would definitely recommend for now since there isn't anything else on the market comparable.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|It's a fun game, but it is pretty lame that you have to pay to continue to play. If it wasn't for that I would give it 5 stars.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Enjoyed movie a lot. Longer movie than average. Underlying messages to be learned from movie.  Can see why movie won so many awards.  Beautiful!
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|this is the best app it has roller coasters and every thing it is the best ever but takes a little bit to install
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|fun game if you are patient,and dont mind that the game runs constantly  hiding on your device collecting personal data needs160+ mb of your  limited ram for file storage.
B00ATPVA78|5.0|I'm getting spoiled with all the new HOG coming out lately. This app has been fun so far, I just bought it after the free trial. There were no issues with downloading and its running fine. The story's a bit fast paced, so I hope it's not to short. Give it a try :)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Sparks is a great writer and his is another wonderful, suspenseful read.  Great to curl up with on a rainy afternoon.
B004YXE438|5.0|I love this puzzle game. I hope they continue to make more. I love all the different pictures. They are so colorgul.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|Works fine - no issues with installation on MBA - don't pay much attention to it which is what you want from an ethernet adapter...
B006MW3UZW|5.0|love my downton abbey!!  Cant wait to see the next season.  One of the best written dramas on tv right now.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I love this game. but I think its stupid that you have to buy the shark after u unlock it.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|This is the third case I have bought for my Fire and it is my favorite.  I would highly recommend it.
B000ZLJOW4|2.0|The movie really never went anywhere.  I could not get vested in any of the characters.  Would not waste my money.
B000001F2X|5.0|If anyone wondered how Eric Clapton got his country sound, this is it. J J Cale is a wonderful music writer.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|image it wold be fun but it is like exterminate fun and the evil monkey rooks. my rarity darn smashing sui the wood with spicks
B00BL5EQLC|5.0|Grudger is one of the best and most simple game that free the day this was posted. I love the idea to make everything steampunk it's great! The controls are also great and smooth. The game like I said before is simple you play as a delivery guy and you have to find packages through the level and at the end you return it to some man. The game overall is great it was a good level of difficulty and uses my favorite genre.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really liked this book till the end.<br />WTH. The ending was so abrupt and really had no conclusion at all.
B005K17RU0|5.0|All you ever need to know about your local weather, plus any where else you care to enter in to the location button. Very helpful app.
0385344333|5.0|Lee Child is an excellent writer.  Keeps you interested from Page 1 of every novel and makes it hard to put it down.
1400069807|5.0|Among the many dangers of our processed food and agriculture, this is the first step to recognize how our food is driving us to obesity and illness. The author focuses on Salt Sugar and Fat and makes a great case. To be read by the layman as well as people who think they know a thing or two about nutrition and want to know the history of how we got here.
B00BEZTMFY|1.0|What is this rubbish? He changed the story for no good bloody reason. The Hobbit book was far better. What is this Bambi crap with some magical bunnies pulling a made-up wizard through the woods? The liberties he took with this movie were just nonsensical rubbish. Very very disappointed.<br /><br />The visuals on the other hand are incredible. His art team is fantastic. His alternations to the story, on the other hand, are crap.

B0086700CM|5.0|This app is very fun. Originally, I would play it on the Apple iPod and I couldn't wait for it to be available in my Kindle Fire's App Store. When I saw it one day, I got it for my Kindle Fire and loved it even more. It runs smoothly (sometimes it has minor glitch moments) but the fun it brings makes up for any slow moving moments that it may have. I love it!

B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This app has phoenomenal graphics, an enjoyable concept, it doesn't have many (if any) glitches and rarely (if at all) moves slowly. It is easy to play (controls can be changed to touch, tilt, and other controls in settings) and can be a favorite for all ages.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is a great sequel to the original Temple Run and features amazing graphics. It works well (no glitches or slow moving moments) and runs virtually smoothly on my Kindle Fire. Overall, this is a great app that is fun for all ages and lovers of the original favorite, Temple Run.

B005HSL626|5.0|This app is a lot of fun. It runs very smoothly and is a great app for all ages. There is the opportunity to unlock backgrounds and blades as you continue to play, which makes you want to play it even more. Great fun!

B008742O32|3.0|I found that it does what is should and does it well.  Pick it up you will find it useful. and problem free.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series keeps pulling us into the story lines of so many different characters.  We laugh, cry and even get angry, but we keep coming back for more.
B00ALCBU4M|3.0|Just a solid story, nothing great. Kind of like watching a good video game trailer. I am glad I picked it up.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Telling the story from the perspective of the bipolar protagonist gives insight into the world view of a mentally ill person.  It also lets the reader discover the truths hidden from him along with the narrator.  It's well done, insightful, and holds the reader's interest through out.  I'd give it another half star, but couldn't make my computer do it.
B002ZG976U|5.0|DVD received in reasonably good time and in good shape. It was well packaged for shipment and makes a great night in movie.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Great app very very fun hi how much you should have been a long time machine gun control over the world exists in the next day of the windows logon
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|love it. so great to have this app on my kindle fire. works great too. j haven't had any problems yet.
B00BL5EQLC|5.0|Typically, I do not enjoy platform type games through my Kindle HD.  My fingers don't fit right and I don't find them enjoyable... I'd rather use my PlayStation.  However, This game provides a better method of control, a puzzle type strategy, fun graphics...  an all over enjoyable (especially for a currently free app) experience.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|This is one of the best shows I've ever watched.  It's so different from everything else out there.  I highly recommend it!
B008BU70HW|5.0|Any fan of &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; would absolutely LOVE this book. It gives you background on many of the different characters without giving away too much as well as what goes on behind the scenes to make the show happen. Loved it!
B00BVYKWJI|5.0|Great acting, I enjoyed the whole season.  I can't wait for season 3 to be available on amazon instant video!
B0079KGAOY|5.0|If you've seen the movies but never owned them this could be a good solution.<br /><br />What drove me to buy this set was the price at a time for all 4 movies and the bonus disc plus, it was all in one case to save space on my cabinet.<br /><br />I will save you from assumptions and false expectations, THIS IS NOT THE DIRECTOR'S CUT version.<br /><br />This set has its trade-offs.  Video quality and sound are really clean.<br /><br />It was a bad decision on WB's part to not port the Lethal Weapon Legacy edition on blu-ray.  If you don't mind about the regular cut of this set you'll be just fine.
B0098VXMNE|5.0|This show has it all... Drama, romance, action, betrayal, you name it.  I can't wait until the final season comes out.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This is just a fun game reminiscent of Mario Cart. The high definition graphics are crisp and clear. Buy the double coin option only and you'll eventually win the game.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I Hate the ads! An addictive and fun game that allows you to play it with out all the interruptions.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Complete Columbo series in nice presentation box. Good quality recordings. A must have for any Columbo fans. Would recommend this product
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My Daughter plays this a lot and says she loves it, I really haven't seen what it does yet, sorry
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|Was a gift for my two grand nephews who own the two other Karate Kid movies.  They loved it.  And still do!
B000QCQ9O8|5.0|This was the second time I have read the novel. I had only remembered some mysterious outlines of the story and I was itching to read it again. You must read the entire novel and not anticipate what will happen; the wonder of the book lies in that. It's better to read the novel before you see the movie; they vary somewhat and would spoil each other. But you will enjoy the characters, and the details of the early years of Britain's involvement in WW II are very moving. This is the work of a novelist who loves his work and has thought about it in depth.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Played it the sec I got it on my new flat screen that I bought just to Christen with this favorite movie.
B00A85EMVK|5.0|great classic movie in itself, but upgrading to 3d blu-ray is amazing. its a must have in my book. get it
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My granddaughters really love this game they all take turns playing the game. So when I want to play they don't want me to play cause they are having so much fun.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple run is a fun game good job.well made keeps you on the edge wondering what's going to happen next.
0449000729|5.0|Like one of your earlier reviewers I became hooked on the genre after reading James A. Michener's Chesapeake. I believe  Michener and Ken Follett are the only two authors equal to Rutherfurd.  Having said that, They are all three a class above the rest. Sarum is delightful, makes you happy, sad, angry and the whole gamut of emotions. I believe it is a first class book of woven fact and fiction in a setting and with characters that the writer paints brilliantly, particularly for those who love social history. Rutherfurd simply can not write fast enough for me.
067101756X|5.0|A great read, opening doors that you would not normally be allowed access. I have had thoughts that we are kept in the dark by higher forces above government level. If you believe of other life out in the universe then read this.<br />Make you own mind up. Mr Corso comes from a military background and had high clearance and access to secret documentation and cover ups. To add, some of the present technology is clearly explained and interesting to anyone in the field of science and electronics. A very honorable and I believe truthful man.<br />The book has pride of place....and look forward to his son who has contributed to his fathers legacy.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It is an awesome game. The only thing I don't like about it is in creative there are no animals.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|i think this app was cool because loved what the sharks could do and i loved to hear the humans scream but the sub marines and harpoon ers were a tough fight but a good prize
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awesome I love it so much I'm crazy for it. Are you cause I am<br /><br />U that's me see ya
B003SJ4VJ6|4.0|If you generally like Polanski's films, you'll probably like this one. THE GHOST WRITER is a low-key, extremely nonviolent, but very compelling poli-thriller. The mood-shifts in this film --from comedy to suspense to various other things--are impressively done. Great cinematography too: This film puts you right there on Martha's Vineyard, on the planes and ferries, in NYC and London, etc. Some very fine acting as well, particularly by Olivia Williams as the former PM's wife: She is a convincingly complex and very surprising character. Several secondary but still extremely important characters are also acted and scripted with fine realism--Special mention to Robert Pugh as the angry, protesting father of a British soldier killed in Iraq.<br /><br />A few patchy places and cheesy plot elements: THE GHOST WRITER may be missing a piece or two somewhere. All the stuff about the CIA and its various supposed shenanigans seems a bit stale, and the parallels with various real-life Iraq War-related entities (e.g., \\"Hatherton\\" Corporation) are way too obvious. More allegory and subtlety in these places would have made this a truly exceptional film.
B00A9V2JSG|3.0|I read the reviews before borrowing this book from the public library.  I knew it wouldn't be perfect, but sure enough, it was too slow for my taste.  I loved reading about Lena and Alex, but after reading the reviews for the next two books, I've decided to stop here.
B009U9S6FI|3.0|The first start of the book was amazing and capturing.  The second part of the book is written for professionals in psychotherapy and is not beneficial for the average Joe.
0439023513|3.0|I loved the first two books and the story, so I was very angry with how this one played out.  The momentum in this book from the first two dies out too soon.  I really, really think she ended up with the wrong person.  It just doesn't make any sense!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One of the best shows that has interesting stories and developing character relationships. Have never seen any of the actors in other shows but they are very good.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book, great momentum, just like the first.  The third book is OK, but I really didn't like how it ended.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|Dull. I have been fond of telling people how The Lord of the Rings was the best film series I have ever seen. This one was SO not there.... too bad.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  There was great momentum, I never wanted to put the book down.  I felt the same way about the second book, but the third doesn't really carry the momentum all the way through.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Rather average looking graphics.  Works ok.  Does what it is designed to do, but nothing extra or special.  Would prefer extra settings and features.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|i work and live in the high tech industry and if you want learn about how computers came to  this world, learn it from Steve Job's point of view.  well written and a great look at how computers came to life.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Amazing series. Did not want to put it down. These books keep you on the edge of your seat, make you laugh, make you cry, and make your heart warm.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|An intelligent read without all the baggage of self-congratulatory intellectualism.<br /><br />The characters are likeable and the subject-matter is timely. It reads quickly and easily but is highly entertaining and, in the end, touching.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I rated this game lower for a couple of reasons.  1. the cards are really small so if you are using your finger to dab it can be difficult.  2. if you accidently dab the bingo  that card ends for the game.  again because the squares are so small this can happen easily.  If they fixed the card size this game would be much better.
B004X6PRO6|3.0|I bought the book because 1) We know so little about North Korea and I enjoy world literature<br />2) North Korea is alarmingly so much in the news lately  and 3) I enjoy a good political thriller<br /><br />Only the first 2 justified plodding on.  This is an interesting, but not compelling book. Certainly not a page-turner in the classic sense.  I turned the pages only looking for more tid-bits, here and there, about N. Korea mind-set, political culture and everyday life.<br /><br />My decision to purchase this book was based on all those amazingly positive reviews by venerable publications, which just goes to show that what's \\"in\\" these days as a topic can unduly influence the book-reviewing media.  What Wall Street Journal calls \\"cunning\\", I call tedious.  What Library Journal calls a \\"fast-paced political thriller\\", I call.... did we read the same book?<br />(I recommend reading the 3* review given by J.BRANDT)<br /><br />Yet, despite the flat, monotone characters, and slow-ish plot, this book is an interesting read primarily because of the unique setting and backdrop.  I would just try to check it out of an e-library or borrow from a friend, instead of plunking down $$.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I can't believe I can I have actually won prizes playing this.  I am never able to at the fair.  Kids 11 & 7 think it is super cool.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|A fascinating glimpse of North Korean life as pictorially exmplified by the light picture. I wonder what has happened in the last 4 years.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Still a good book that I have to see what the next one brings.  The only way to get to see what i<br />going to happen.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I read it in two days. Can't wait to get to read the rest of the trilogy.  Thanks Amazon Prime.
B00APAENUI|5.0|Another Honor Harrington Book.  David Weber is a great author and this series is well written, exciting, and fun to read.  Weber develops his characters and increases the pace of all of his books, so that by the time you get to the end you are staying up late or putting something off to finish.  This is a great book!!
B008EZVNFE|5.0|i like this new artist the songs are great and infectious,songs from the heart.love her voice great pipes, can't wait for the next.
1932100660|5.0|This is an excellent book and a must-have for anyone that is interested in his/her diet and health. It gives a complete overview of nutritional science, the china study and proposes ways to make significant improvements to your health.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|great graphics. great time waster game. love the control options. short or long game play. get a kick out of jaws theme attacks.
0307476073|2.0|My husband and I took up multi-day backpacking several years ago, and when I picked up \\"Wild\\" from the library, I fully expected to enjoy a story about someone finding themself on the Pacific Crest Trail. Unfortunately, whatever it was I expected to find within the pages of this book never came to fruition.  \\"Wild\\" was a huge disappointment to me.<br /><br />This book follows the life of Cheryl Strayed from the early passing of her mother, through the breakdown of her marriage, to her subsequent hike on the PCT.<br /><br />I will preface the rest of this review by saying-- I was unable to relate to Cheryl and her experiences in any way, shape or form. Perhaps if you've shared a similar background, her thoughts and actions will make more sense to you. But for me, I felt like I was reading 300 pages of inexcusable stupidity. This included a high-risk lifestyle of indiscriminate sleeping around and rampant heroin use-- not to mention her state of complete unpreparedness for the hiking trail. Cheryl set out on the PCT with no previous backpacking experience, an enormously heavy pack, too small hiking boots, no knowledge of ice axes, no hiking poles and had filled her stove with the wrong fuel. You'd think she'd learn quickly from these mistakes, but no. Somewhere in California she abandons her dromedary bag and the faces 95+ degree heat with a couple of water bottles... At one point she was so dehydrated, she drank over 100 oz (3L+) of water, and didn't pee again for hours. It's a miracle she made it off the trail missing only a few toenails.<br /><br />It's great that Cheryl found something in herself on the trail that allowed her to turn her life around. However, I felt that her story was full of recklessness that shouldn't necessarily be celebrated. I also felt like I was being bombarded with shock-factor at every turn, which is a writing style I do not appreciate. As a hiker myself, I wouldn't recommend this book to others, but I can see that my opinion is in the minority.
B001DU8T6I|5.0|Loved this CD and so did my ten year old niece, this girl can sing!! Some of the songs i had heard before, but most not. My niece said the same and the moment she found out i got this she begged me until i put it on her laptop and mp3 player. Same thing happened with Demi's second CD too, and I'm sure will happen again when i get around to getting her third album as well. What's not to love about this CD or this lovely amazing singer!!
B0086700CM|4.0|Very fun game diffinitely time passing game! try it and you'll see.. it has challenges to be done.<br />you can get it on Kindle fire, Smartphones,Ipads.
B0096BIENY|5.0|Love their music. Not just the best crossover group, but great in every way.  Their WICKED GAME was absolutely the greatest.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|After hearing about this at the office, I had to check it out. It was ... interesting.  Reminded me of online smut chats.  Wait, that was in there.  Likely how the author did her research, but she probably should have taken the time to edit for the moron factor.  You know - make it at least appear to be written by a professional.  Wait!  She is a pro.  Well, there you have it, folks.  Anyone can write a book, but not just anyone can pen a good book.  I swear...I thought if I read the words \\"oh my\\" and \\"jeez\\" from the heroine one more time I was going to gag.  And let me assure you that I do not mean from pleasure.  After a while, it just seemed silly and Sophomoric.  The premise was okay.  The problem here was in the lousy execution of it.  Cheesy.  Thick, yellow, deli-sliced cheese.  Great money-maker, though.  And she's laughing all the way to the bank.  ;-)
B0055SWM08|5.0|Simple presentation, quick to learn, tricky to master. I enjoyed the look of the game, and enjoyed how challenging the puzzles could be.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I have seen other films directed by David Fincher (Zodiac and Seven) but I think this film is his best. All the actors in Dragon Tattoo are excellent and the plot of this film is deep, involving old testament references and mysterious disappearances of  young women. This is the best film I have seen in recent weeks. You have to pay close attention to what is happening on your screen to sort out the good guys and bad guys. Enjoy!
B005LAII44|1.0|Duke, Snake Eyes, Flint, Storm Shadow, Roadblock, Mouse and Jinx among other cartoonish chracters laughably engage in non-stop 3D action that is aimed at whom?  Little boys that play with 12 inch dolls and their dads?  Saying GIJ V.2 is better than it's predecessor is not high praise.  Too many characters, too complex, absurd and ridiculous plot lines and way too many decibels.  Here the Joes are not only fighting their mortal enemy Cobra but also internal threats from their - \\"our\\" -- own government that jeopardize their very existence.  This is the epitome of concussive, mindless popcorn entertainment.  The President's kidnaped (What? Not again!), ninjas, knives, satellite weapons, London decimated and so on.  It actually wallows in its stupidity.  Dwayne \\"the Rock\\" Jonson, Channing Tatum, Bruce Willis collect their checks and Jon Chu (\\"Justin Bieber: Never Say Never\\") directs like a dancer on steroids.  And to think that this $185 million production was held back from a late 2012 release to take advantage of Tatum's alleged \\"star power\\" and to give the movie an expensive $20 million 3D fix with additional shots, edits for more action - but even less clarity and coherence.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|the walking dead is addictive , that is all there is to say .... An amazing show with really good actors.... season three is better than season 1&2
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We are entirely pleased with Downton Abbey. The characters are so realistic and genuine that we come to know them and love them.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I have read most of the Jack Teacher books, and each has new insight into Jack.  In spite of my knowledge of the main character, he continues to surprise me with each book.  This book is no exception, and I am looking forward to reading the next book.  I am rooting for Jack to get to Virginia!
B00BUI6D2A|1.0|I wrote a view before on iTunes and one that was \\"too explicit\\" elsewhere. Getting to the point, I am a huge Wayne fan but this album is 100 percent trash and I cannot believe Wayne thought it was worthy of calling it \\"I Am Not A Human Being 2\\". The first one was tight but this album fell apart already. My biggest complaint is that it's too vulgar. I am 30 something and it was hard on my ears, I work in a Jail and I was offended. The wordplay or play on words is amazing, he is a genius when it comes to that. The content was vulgar, draining and demeaning to respectable people that listened to the album. Seems like it catered to the young, restless and ratchet. I say it's the WORST Wayne album to date. Mr. Carter please sit down...
B0034G4P80|5.0|Natalie, Chris  and Clegg give great performances, Anthony Hopkins as Odin mirrors the comics and cartoons, with his own raw fatherly humanity added. Hiddleton is nasty as Loki( also seen just as nasty in the Avengers) the guy who plays the gate (Byfrost)keeper, steals the show a couple times, with such a high powered cast and director, seems necessary and well done.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I love this story!  This couple has put themselves through and back. As much as they tried to stay apart it only brought them closer together. Cant wait for part 2.
B000SSV8HI|1.0|many concerts,. many tracks, great versions, great back up and vocals, Keiths sparse style is an obvious dissappointment<br />but Ronnie does his best to push on through, Mick, Charley, Darryl, Chuck , Lisa Fischer, just nail it.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|This DVD got to my house really quick! It's awesome. It came with everything it said it would. I'm very happy with my purchase.
6305718954|4.0|Graet story and effects better actng and message and yes there is a Gospel opf St Thomas and yes it does say those things, I looked it up, cool movie for the religious horror genre. Predates Constantine, but is a neat companion to that or DaVinci Code.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|It used to be a piece of cake to buy and download a song from Amazon. With the introduction of the cloud you have to jump through so many hoops to get the item on to your computer it makes it frustrating. To top if off 2 of the last three downloads that are on the cloud and with help from amazon are on my computer. One of the songs was upcut and the other had so many pops and clicks in it I deemed it worthless. With so many professional noise reduction progrms available to the people supplying amazon digital services with product there is no excuse for poor mastering. By the way Amazon did refund my money.
B000CCD0HQ|4.0|many great tracks, especially, Jesus just left Chicago, laGrange and beer drinkers and hell raisers<br />classic blues rock, tight with great vocals, years before the beards got long
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|just a feel good, enjoyable family show! that can be viewed over and over again! By the whole family, Thanks!
B004VQRCF0|5.0|unbelievable mixture of 70s and 80s all playing together-really amazing music, style and execution.<br />Trever, Howe, Wakeman all in top form
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I really enjoyed playing Quell Reflect.  It makes you think and doesn't get boring.  Get this game. You will not regret it.  Great job fallen tree games!!
B0009MDPYM|5.0|This is an early film with La Boeuf where he is again partner to a legend, this time &#34;Keanu&#34; as a tough, smoking, demon fighter and what a badass he is, Rachel Weiss is haunting in the twin roles, Swinton climbed out of her glass box to play Gabriel and the Devil looks like he owns a casino in Vegas, What a movie!
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|In a nutshell, don't waste your time and money. Lincoln is an extremely boring, slow moving film, and I had trouble getting it to play at all. HINT: If you have trouble watching it online, reload the page and it should start. After watching about 20 long, boring minutes, I realized the movie was going absolutely nowhere, so I skipped ahead several more minutes to see if it would get any better. I couldn't tell the plot had progressed past the same boring discussions about the 13th amendment that monopolized it so far. Honestly, I don't think the movie would be 3o minutes long without all the boring dialog about the 13th amendment. The average person is just not going to be thrilled with sitting through all the blah blah blah about the struggles of passing the 13th amendment. I'm definitely not a history buff, but since I was impressed by the cast and all the great reviews, I expected more. Most every good movie will grab your attention at the beginning and hold it to the end. This one failed that test miserably. I don't think I'll waste any more of my time to finish watching it before it expires. This one expired long before it hit the big screen.
B005Z28M58|5.0|Love these shows wish that didn't end them but received disk fast bought it brand new cheaper than every where eles here , and received it 3 days after ordering it !
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|I liked it but it needs way more time!!! because when you want to build a house you don't have enough time to. if you like it just for a sneak peak well then buy it
B005ELQVGW|5.0|Bjork is a musician that you either love or hate.  I, personally, love Bjork.  I think she has an amazing artistic sensibility and drastic range in her music.  If you like her other material you will enjoy this one.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great game luv it fun and exciting the mystery box's could show up a bit more often coz some things u have to collect 100s of them and it glitches quite a lot but all in all a good design
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Same as my other report on this game. I love it and go back to get 3 stars love it
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Told from different points of view, this is less a story about zombies - in fact, the word &#34;zombies&#34; doesn't make an appearance - and more a story of how the world would react, on a macro- and microcosmic level, to an Extinction-Level event, here: a virus that spreads like an apolitically-motivated army, requiring militaristic, geo-political, and personal responses. The reader explores these responses through POV vignettes that reveal the true horror is not from the perceived, immediate threat, but rather from the choices to be faced and necessarily made to abide by the one unifying moral imperative - survive at all costs.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love doing the angry bird games. After I get them all I go back and try for 3 stars.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Excellent book, would have really liked to meet him. Really liked the breakdown on the weapon systems that he used.
0451232852|4.0|It is light, but interesting reading -- keeps you engaged.  There are a number &#34;turn of events&#34;.  Fairly easy to follow the characters.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome and if u don't believe me try it for yourselves it is kind of like temple run but more advanced
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Just like Mr. Sanderson - reel you hook line and sinker and leave you wanting more.  I am glad that this at least ties into Elantris - waiting for the journey to continue!
B008518MOW|5.0|3D is great! Men in Black Is a cool series!<br />Great graphics!<br /> And right in your own home! I recomen this to all Families! Fun!
B007N6NGYG|4.0|pretty good. can get a good challenge from the later levels. sometimes the control can be frustrating. level skip can be a huge help.
B005GSVFB4|5.0|This fun for all the family!!! I Love it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /> The stories are fun I want them all and will buy again!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Easy to use product. Lots of options to choose from. Would recommend this product to my friends. Easy to download.
B009ZQ8FQG|1.0|When I tried to watch the next episode I got a message saying it was not in my library. In fact I can't find it anywhere. I am very angry and unsure how to complain and possibly get a refund. I would prefer my purchase be accessible!
B0090SI4OC|4.0|\\"The Host\\" is pretty good. This is how the story goes: What if everything you love was taken from you in the blink of an eye? When an unseen enemy threatens mankind by taking over their bodies and erasing their memories, Melanie Stryder will risk everything to protect the people she cares most about - Jared, Ian, her brother Jamie and her Uncle Jeb, proving that love can conquer all in a dangerous new world.<br /><br />The cast led by Saoirse Ronan (as Melanie / Wanda) is pretty good. The directing & screenplay (Based on the novel by Stephenie Meyer, who also produced) by Andrew Niccol is pretty good.<br /><br />The music by Antonio Pinto is pretty good. The cinematography by Roberto Schaefer is pretty good. The film editing by Thomas J. Nordberg is pretty good. The casting by Mindy Marin is pretty good. The production design by Andy Nicholson is pretty good. The art direction by Beat Frutiger is pretty good. The set decoration by Cynthia La Jeunesse, set dressings by Derek Bensonhaver, Phillip Joffrion, Matt Zaff, Bill Walters & Colin Zaug is pretty good. The costume design by Erin Benach is pretty good. The special effects coordinated by Jack Lynch is pretty good. The visual effects coordinated by Aakanksha Bharati, Rachel Faith Hanson, Nick Ocean & Laetitia Seguin, supervised by Eric D. Christensen, Jamie Hallett, Sebastien Moreau, John P. Nugent, D.J. Shea, Madhu Sudhanan & Olcun Tan is pretty good. The stunts coordinated by Sam Hargrave is pretty good.<br /><br />This is a pretty good and entertaining sci-fi adventure that keeps you interested and is also well-made and well-crafted. Andrew Niccol has done another interesting film to add on his resume. Saoirse Ronan gives a solid performance alongside a solidly-acted supporting cast. This is also another interesting version of a novel brought to the big screen, and is also an interesting adaptation of Stephenie Meyer's novel.
B000FA675C|5.0|Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!<br />You must read this book.<br />With the twist and turns Mr. Brown uses there is no way you can guess the out come by the end.
B005KDDUVS|5.0|Fabuloso, cuando sale el proximo libro, una historia fantastica espero tener pronto mas libros de este autor, leanse la rosa de fuego
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is the best game, recommend it to everyone and it is so much better and way more addictive than temple run BUY THIS APP!!!!!!!
8866130907|3.0|The only problem I have at all with this planner is it's size.  I was looking for something larger as I'm an extremely busy gal.  However, it does offer everything I need in a smaller form and fits right into my school bag with no problem.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|we follow the weather every day. this worked great. I would recommend it to everyone. watch the weather channel on tv every day.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I use Adobe Reader to download info for my kindle tablet. It's easy to rand gets the job done.I love this product.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I finally broke down and bought this collection. I knew i was going too, just was not going to pay $100 (found it for $60! couldnt pass) Alright, lets see, this is the 9th different Star Wars collection i have purchased, weather its vhs,dvd ect... And im sure it wont be the last! First of all, like everyone else i am upset that it is the 1997 versions ond not the original '77- '83. Hopefully Disney will make that happen then we can stop buying Star Wars collections! (yeah right!) The movies look execellent on blu ray, crisper, clearer, colors pop out! The reason i gave it 5 stars is for the bonus discs. Its cool seeing the behind the scenes for Episodes I, II, III, but i was 26 in '99 & a Star Wars geek so thats really nothing new to me, BUT, to see behind the scenes, rough cuts, deleted scenes & interviews for IV, V VI, are just Amazing! Even though some scenes are only 15 seconds,Its so interesting to see what did not  make it to the final cut of the three classic films. And everything that went into making sci-fi films Before CGI!! If you can find this collection for a decent price its definitly worth it! As for getting the original 1977 - '83 films on dvd or blu ray... Help us Disney, your our only hope!
0547848412|4.0|Life of Pi is extraordinarily complex, bought it after seeing the movie. Book and movie are siblings, not twins!!!<br />Can't write a proper review but let me state what impressed me most:<br />Part I on the growing up and education of Pi, the sections on religion  (Christianity, Hinduism)<br />The detailed descriptions and reflections on animal life of all kinds.<br />NOT A BOOK FOR CHILDREN, movie is misleading in this respect.<br />I did not particularly like the language.<br /><br />A.Trier, Santiago, Chile
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game to play! The grafics are great and the game play is very simple and easy to understand. Just an all around treat game.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|It's very well written and totally awesome, but I must admit, after &#34;Legion&#34;, I was probably expecting too much. It has its moments of pure genius, but I'm partial to Sanderson, I'll find amazing even his shop list, I'm sure!
B00B9366VO|5.0|Being a musician and recording engineer, this was a great look into the history of a legendary studio. Though I wouldn't agree with the hard line they drew between the great analog days and the bad digital days. Obviously it was more about poor business practices that were the demise of Sound City. And there was nothing magical about that Neve console that couldn't prevent making a bad recording. Case in point, after the Neve was moved to Dave's 606 studio for the soundtrack album, the movie itself sounds really good, but the CD sounds bad in comparison. Heavily compressed, no dynamics.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Quick, easy, fun to play just to pass the time. I like that I can get bonuses just by signing in to Facebook. You can play entirely for free if you want.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Read about eight books so far and when I start can't put the book down.  Which I could get to read about Reacher when he went to WestPoint.  I read the Second Son and enjoyed it very much!  I enjoy all Lee Child 's books so far!
B009OYSFDM|5.0|At first-look, you'll think its another one of those superhero- wannabe- shows but it really is good and leaves you craving more. It has all of the excitement, intrigue, and good-looking men I crave in a show. Recommend you get watching if you haven't already.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Like I said about the other book I love all the ones I have read so far!!!  I like the ones when his is a Major in the Army, I'll try to get those too.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I am loving this game, but My settlement is still stuck in winter mode<br /><br /> and I cannot connect to Facebook.
B00280LYIC|4.0|Percy is awesome! The book has many surprises in stock, fantastic characters and an ending that is unforgettable. Read it!!!!!
B001O8C5EQ|5.0|This newer release of Signify is well worth owning. Signifys release is when I first heard PTs stuff and it's impact on me was substantial to say the least! Been keenly interested in the band ever since and have never been let down. I am really into this band and will always want to keep up with their journey through time...great stuff!!
B0002TJGQS|5.0|it took a long time to come, maybe the got lost in the mail or something and finally came now. I thought they were never going to come but they did, i put them in my keychian flashlight and they work wonderful. thanks you so much. cheaper and way better than any other deal. you guys rock!
B00AANGHXQ|5.0|Texas Flood is a recording that brought the blues back into the mainstream. It set the bar for any blues artist that followed. A recording that one, who truly enjoys the blues, will never tire of hearing.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|There's always another secret<br /><br />That sums up the Mistborn trilogy, and it's a fitting motto. I had to give this book a five-star review because of how tightly it fits all the mysteries and half-truths we learned in the course of the trilogy.<br /><br />As a fantasy-fan and fellow author, what Brandon Sanderson did here is stunning. Amazing. Watertight. His world-building is made even more amazing by the fact it all goes back to the first book, without incoherences or made-up stuff.<br /><br />I found myself smiling through most of this last book, or laughing at how stupid I had been, since I hadn't figured it all out. But this series of books is so well-crafted, that what you overlook as a throwaway comment is actually a big part of the story.<br /><br />There are some issues, though. Some plotlines plod along while others with more potential are barely shown. I think Sanderson's dialogue is ok, his prose is not the most stunning. But his worldbuilding, his plotting and his rhythm are perfect. And he has some truly satisfying lines, especially when he pulls a move that makes total sense and you barely saw coming.<br /><br />But the sheer magnitude of the author's accomplishment dwarfs any weaknesses. I spent half the book wondering how he would make all the juxtaposed plotlines fit, thinking he wouldn't have the time or that it would be unsatisfying. I should have had more faith. I should have trusted him more.<br /><br />And that's the message of this trilogy, and it's a good one. It doesn't feel like a cliche. I was smiling at the end, though I was sad for some of the characters. But the twists and turns in this story are deeply satisfying. I was betting on a different outcome, though. I thought Elend would end up being the Hero of Ages. I was wrong, but I was never happier to find out I was.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This game is very neat. The graphics are incredible and the obstacles are awesome. It's a must have for kindle fire users.
B000UZQI0Q|4.0|Just when you think you've got it figured out, Brandon pushes one more curtain and reveals a twist or a secret that has been percolating since the first book. His world-building is awesome because of this same reason, because he'll probably keep digging into the same mythology of half-truths he built on the first book. That's why his books seem so organic. Most writers seem to juggle a lot of things and it's harder for them to keep up the tension in sequels to successful books. Not this man, he had it all figured out.<br />As a fellow author, I'm impressed. Even though this one isn't as good as the first book, in many respects (mainly because the first one reads as a great caper and has more tension), this one didn't have any less of an emotional punch.<br />I'm anxious to see how he caps it off with the third book, and I've already bought \\"The Alloy of Law\\" because I'm addicted by now.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This might just be  my new favorite book. I laughed. I cried. I got angry. I fell in love. This book was beautiful and really made you FEEL. John Green is a fantastic writer and I would recommend this book to anyone. There is one con to this book: it ends.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|A easy to use battery app that shows where your battery usage is and where you can adjust it. Love the visual display and also how it tells you how long your device will last while using (I.e. music..books...internet...game play)
B0081HLM2E|5.0|One of best foreign films of 2012.  Nesbo's book laid the groundwork for a fast, exciting film.  The actors are superb.  The visual jokes are really really funny.  Watch it and see!<br /><br />1
B00APUQT7I|5.0|After I watched this show it made me think of family and how no matter where they are we still think about them often.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|At under $20, this is a GREAT mic. I bought it to record my car's exhaust as I drove around L.A. I think it sounds great, but hey! Judge for yourself!  [...]
B00936A0RU|5.0|Loved the movie, especially since it's based on a true story.  Interesting to see how moonshiners lived and operated their business.  Great acting.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Accuweather is not really very accurate, but then I live in a rural area and have not found one that is.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is a great game to play to pass the time away. Fun and fast great game to pass the time while you are in line and just waiting for an appointment.
B000002J1M|5.0|it's the good Genesis era Peter j'adores les Genesis de la période de Peter Gabriel les paroles poètiques et la musique fantastique
B006C1DH92|4.0|Fun game!!! I love playing it fast paced and works real well on the Kindle. I am glad I downloaded it.
B0083Z6AH6|3.0|I liked Pride and Predjudice much better.  Hard to follow.  It takes quite a while to get around to an actual story.<br />Not finished yet, though. May revisit this rewiew.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|When I purchased this item I didn't realize how much I would like it it is convenient it is easy to input alarm  time's
B009KEN87O|4.0|I got it as the free app of the day. fun but short and not very replayable. good classic style though.
B00007AJGH|3.0|The CD of this older movie has been viewed many times by my nephew's daughter.  I kept the adult version but have not watched it.  It made a great gift to a little girl that had seen it and wanted a copy to watch over and over.
B005K17RU0|5.0|An amazing app to have especially for those on the go and as the season's change so we  can plan our day to its fullest
B000JIN3J8|4.0|I like Jane Austen, and I enjoy seeing how life was lived in other centuries.  I have only watched one episode so far, but I do intend to watch the series.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|One of the best classic`s  I read this when I was growing up, an really enjoyed reading it to my daughter's when they were small then again with them when they learned to read as we took turns each of us reading a chapter everyday.
B00A3SGWYC|3.0|Some of Pitbull's songs I really LOVE but it's starting to get old. His theme is always &#34;I Know You Want Me&#34; and I'm kind of turned off by it now. I bought the Album because it was only $5 otherwise I would have bought the few songs I really like by themselves. Don't Stop the Party and Feel This Moment are my favorites and I think Back In Time is ok.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|One of the best games I've ever played. One of my favorites on the kindle fire. I very much recomend this game. If you don't your a mentally challenged person!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I've tried a few different apps but all of them had slow downloads or wouldn't download videos correctly. TubeMate works ever time I use it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun I like how it goes to like Rio then Rome and etc who ever made this game God bless u your awesome
B00BESM14U|5.0|This film followed the book very well, but also gave me suspense as to what would happen next. Love it!
B0015AARJI|5.0|Excelente producto lo mejor del mercado se los aseguro comprenlo  saludos desde venezuela comprenlo 100% recomendado  son mucho mejor que  cualquier copia
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game love it. Totally fun,I can't get enough it. All of my friends know about this game from me. We challenge each other for the highest score.<br />Thank you.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Once you start you can't stop,this game is soooo addictive,you can earn tons of stuff, and it definitely can keep you busy!
B00ARI9CDQ|5.0|Enjoy reading news from all over in &#34;digest&#34; form. Very enlightening and informative.<br />Thank you very much for this free information.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show really gets you into the plot and the characters. I find myself constantly questioning what I would do in the same situation. Many of the situations have no positive outlook so there is never a correct way to handle them since the plot was so well put together. It is an unpredictable, unimaginable, and unbelievable show.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|The words are mostly directly<br />This sucks L.O.L. also friend me on Facebook and follow me on Twitter peace out
B0040HO01Y|4.0|My latest guilty pleasure is watching period dramas on my kindle.<br /><br />I stumbled upon Lark Rise to Candleford and enjoyed season 1 very much.  Very folksy characters, who draw you into their towns and stories easily.  Perhaps I've seen similar characters before, but as I said, it is easy to get drawn into the small town stories.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game. It's way better that temple run.......you can collect coins faster &amp; it's easier to collect because there's so many!!!!!!!!
B008M87GJK|5.0|The BBC News app is currently my favorite news app on the Android platform.  Quality of the stories is very good, and it provides me with a worldwide perspective on news.  You can customize the display of what news categories you want to see, as well as what global regions are important to you.  The one thing I like most about the BBC News app (as opposed to others I have tried) is the fact that headlines are far less &#34;sensational&#34; than many other apps I have tried.  I also find a good variety of stories with this app.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Honestly amazing book, currently my favorite, along with the movie being equally as moving. I would recommend it especially for teenagers, specifically girls
B004DLPXAO|1.0|always says it's loading but never stops  big battery drain.  i just uninstalled it but it won't revert ot the factory version
B006Q1SQCQ|4.0|This book works. The authors Lucas and Lorayne use a conversational style to communicate the techniques. I was surprised to be able to memorize the names of the 50 states in order in an exercise that took only about 30 minutes. Two weeks later, it's still sticking. I'm also able to recall a phone number I needed two weeks ago.<br /><br />I'm infamously bad at remembering people's names, even people who I work with on a daily basis. The Memory Book is giving me some tools to correct that issue.<br /><br />The great thing about these techniques is that there are multiple opportunities every day to use them.<br /><br />The examples and rhetorical style are of a previous era. The first numbers exercise uses an embarrassingly sexist phrase, so if you're turned off by 1980's dudebro elbow-ribbing humor, you might want to look for a different guide.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|First I will admit I am new to photography, but from my unprofessional point of view, this is a great flash.  The two main points is that 1) it does produce a better picture over using the internal flash of my D3200 when the subject is not very close, and 2) it saves my battery on my camera so that I can shoot many flash photos and go a longer time before my camera batter runs out.<br /><br />Finally, I think what I like most about it, is its size - VERY small - smaller than I anticipated (which is a good thing).  This means it will come with me more often.
B00BESLHEA|1.0|This movie made no sense, RZA should stick to his day job and keep on rhyming because his acting skills are sub par. I couldn't even finish this movie it was that bad.
B000002O4X|5.0|This listening is a wonderful experience, breath taking, especially if you've seen the movie.  It keeps me calm when I have to drive in heavy traffic, or bad weather for long distances.  Also great meditating music.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game can be addictive - can't they all?  I don't really have anything else to say so will just fill up space. :^)
B000JQUMPI|5.0|Loved it! I was very sad about Beth but the rest is awesome!! I love that Laurie doesn't marry jo like every would think!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|this is his 1st lp-could have been a hit had he had some promo back then-give it a good listen and decide for yourself
B00B5FHJCG|3.0|How soon before these are available.  All of the books are being reprinted in order. How long till we can download these in the States.  These are  wonderful stories and  I look forward to seeing them
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|I love eric  met him several times-this cd I like because of his variation of style-I am just an eric fan since the 60's and have most of what he ever puts out.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|All hype and no substance. Why did the producers decide to keep original cast? There is no link between Season 1 and 2!!!
B001TCHDPS|5.0|after seeing the documentary SEARCHING FOR SUGARMAN I got both his cds-this car blows me away-I suggest this to everybody-what a voice-and his subject material is right on-I love rodriguez
B0087IT8FK|5.0|I don't watch a lot of foreign films as I usually don't have the patience to sit through the subtitles, even if it does look like a really good story.  This film was absolutely worth it - it's one of the best films (not just foreign ones) that I've seen in a long time.  Based on a true story, an unlikely friendship is forged between Driss and Philippe shared with emotion, adventure, struggle and humor.  By the end of the film I was left with a good feeling in my heart and a smile on my face - there aren't many films that do that these days.  Even if you're not a big fan of foreign films - give this one a try, I don't think you will be disappointed.
1616550414|5.0|Amazing book of Zelda and Myamoto creation. This book complete my collection of this fantastic world of Hyrule. Great work and images...
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is one of the best TV series I have ever had to the pleasure of watching.<br />I cannot wait until the next season comes out.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Totally addicting! I definitely recommend anyone get this app if you enjoy search &amp; find games. Fun fun fun... oh and it's free!
B004H8GLXQ|5.0|bookshelves: contemporary-literature, gothic, suspense<br />Read from March 27 to 29, 2013 -- I own a copy<br /><br />I give a 5 rating sparingly, but this book caught me by surprise. I've had it on my shelf for a couple of years, and I picked it up on a whim.<br /><br />The gothic feel of this book is dreamlike, and there are so many jewels of phrases and quotes that I will probably read this book at second time at some point.<br /><br />If this book is not on your \\"to read\\" list, add it now. If it is on your \\"to read\\" list, move it up to next in line.<br /><br />I'll leave you with one of my favorite lines in the book.<br /><br />\\"Do you know the feeling when you start reading a new book before the membrane of the last one has had time to close behind you? You leave the previous book with ideas and themes - characters even - caught in the fibers of your clothes, and when you open the new book, they are still with you.\\" Dianne Satterfield The Thirteenth Tale
B00BP4Z8XY|1.0|We thought this would be a good family movie. In the first 15 minutes one cartoon character ripped the heart out of a zombie. It was also very violent. What a huge disappointment! I would definite not recommend this is a family movie.
B001BWDG0W|5.0|This is a great soundtrack for Mamma Mia!  I can recognize the actors & actresses singing.  I listen to it on my way to work.
B005EVVESM|5.0|Never get tired of listening to this.  There is not one track on the album that I do not enjoy.  Great purchase!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I thought this game was very interesting on first glance. So I thought, why not get it? It's a really fun game that my cousins like to play when I'm not. I recommend it if you like horses. It's a really fun app.
1419830619|5.0|arrived early in exclent condition thank you<br />i would recomeend this product to everyone<br />thank you soo much i am very happy
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really love this app!!! Its so colorful and fun and addicting!!! Better then temple run 1 and 2!  Its one of the only apps I have that I actually use!!!
B000001GJU|5.0|Coming on the heels of Kondrashin's superb 1979 digital account of the Dvorak \\"New World\\" Symphony, the Vienna Philharmonic made this recording with Karajan in 1985. Karajan had recorded this work many times before and his interpretation had changed very little.  The work is superbly played and recorded.  My only caveat is that Karajan's legato phrasing mitigates against the rustic flavor of this work and the accompanying Smetana \\"Moldau\\".  The result is a more generalized, less Czech sounding performance.  Fans of the conductor, however, will not be disappointed with the results. The sound of the recording alone is worth the price of admission.
B005T87QCI|5.0|i would totally recommend this game for anyone. the controls are really easy to use. the only thing i dont like about this game is that u have to pay for the build your own robot. i think it should atleast come as a free part of the game. other then that its a really fun easy to use game:)
B000VXJMYG|4.0|I would have never known about this group if it were not for a much older brother.  I picked this up for the heck of it one day and it brought back a lot of memories.  I highly recommend this is a full listing experience from start to finish.  Its a great recording.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Wreck-It Ralph was a fun movie for me (an almost 40 year old) and my boys (10 and 8).  Creative, fun and funny this movie will appeal to anyone who wants to have a good time watching a movie.
B00BU2SIW4|4.0|This is a great all around album.  I would have given it 5 stars if it had snappier drums beats like the old days.  I guess that part of the music has grown past that.  Its still an element that I miss and I think that it makes the over all recording seem mellow.  Other than that, the song writing is great.  Dave Gahan probably sounds better than ever.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love the horse but I'm at a stuck point so do not and I mean do not end up like me
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this game is amazing and addicting. i prefer it to more popular games out there. its so much fun and you never kniw what'll happen. i recommend buying the basic map for 5000 coins. although it costs alot it makes it easier to explore and find new lakes, coves and beaches.
B00AJER3SE|5.0|I don't care if it's \\"washed\\",\\"enhanced\\" or in any other way altered from the original. Finally, we now have a beautiful looking and sounding version of what I consider to be the best science fiction film of all time. What took Cameron so long?
B0050DIWFC|5.0|One of the most provocative stories, great for any book group! It keeps you turning those pages until the very surprising ending!
B001Q7JD3Q|3.0|There was much added to the original movie with Fay Wray, and much of it was the same old special effects hype that all movies seem to use nowadays, things that are not really possible like machine-gunner giant insects off the leading man's body without hitting him. But thanks to CGI, I did like the emotions of Kong's face that other movies could not show. It is, perhaps, too long a movie that could have done without a few fight scenes and gory things that most younger people seem to thrive on. Just give me a good story, good script, and good acting. For diversion, though, I did enjoy it.
B0071AKB38|5.0|This is an amazing little speaker with excellent sound quality.  It can be hooked up to other speakers making them wireless as well.
B001EC0OMW|3.0|I bought this and other Hammer Dracula films just for diversion. It is the same story that the other films have: Dracula comes to life, he kills the beautiful women, he is destroyed.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Peter Jackson's The Hobbit-An Unexpected Journey Is by far amazing!!!!!It I think is better than the lord of the rings.I actually sat through the whole movie and the funny thing is,It is about the same amount of time as LOTR.lol. I can't wait for the Hobbit 2-The Desolation Of Smaug in Dec.Im def gonna see that in the theater<br /><br />WELL DONE PETER JACKSON!!! :)
B000HKYNQ0|5.0|I enjoy discovering known actors doing various parts in each episode.  Lots of the best classic Star Trek here.  Enjoy
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Silver Linings Playbook takes you through a delightful romp of a story about a guy piecing himself together. Excellently written, the whole book flies by without you even noticing how fast it's developing.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|You have the option to spend real money for faster progress and special upgrades, but unlike some games, you can still get really good game play for free.  Not an action packed game but its fun to check in regularly and build your park up.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Lee Child, this was an awesome book.  And because I loved this one but not really the second one, I am willing to read the 3rd and give it the benefit of the doubt.  Jack Reacher is too damn good at everything, which can be a little annoying at times, but I'd rather have him in my corner than anyone else!
0718113241|5.0|I love the James Herriot books.  They are such delightful, feel good stories & made an easy enjoyable read.  He loved his work, the people, the animals & esp the countryside which he marveled at continuously. He writes so vividly you can see it & why he loves it so. He gets himself into situations anyone, esp anyone in the healthcare profession, will be able to relate to.  I got this as a Christmas gift for a friend who read one of mine & loved it.
B001NHNG64|3.0|I was skipping whole pages at some points.  Found it a little stupid that he'd have sex with a girl in despair after discovering a dead body.  And I didn't understand the end at all.  Made me hesitant for book #3...
B003QSPTAY|5.0|One of my favorites from when I was a kid, my kids were looking for a movie to watch and I stumbled on this. My kids loved it as much as I did.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|We enjoy the music of the Lumineers as well as Mumford & Sons, and F.U.N. We now own all three albums and are very happy with purchasing the cd's to listen to in our different music devices.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|Great product for the price. Ships fast and product is exactly what was expected. Would recommend product and seller to a friend.
B008NW67E0|5.0|We enjoy the music of the Mumford & Sons as well as The Lumineers, and F.U.N. We now own all three albums and are very happy with purchasing the cd's to listen to in our different music devices.
B00C1BUYX4|2.0|Not sure what I was expecting but this was ridiculously boring. Clearly the acting & costumes were great but the speed of plot was so boring.  And I like smart movies, documentaries, etc.  Boring.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|It is now my favorite music player on my android phone. I like that I could download my amazon purchases and it imported all my other music.
B00A11AN6O|4.0|nice application but hard to know how to getting items into the program, no directions to follow how to get pics loaded.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Just love it. At first I didn't think anything would happen and then. Holly mooly this is a great book once all the tension is gone.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This is one of the finest movies of all time, and the finest 3D movie to date.  We enjoyed it more on our large screen TV than we did at the theater.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I really liked this game because it was really like Temple Run except with slightly different controls. It is cool because there are different things you can collect. I really liked this game but I would have to say it's not as good as Temple Run.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is the best. I love it so much. Thank you so much. I play it everywhere. At the doctors office. The bus. The reason ride to school. Yay!!!
B005K17RU0|3.0|The words are too little and I can find no way to make the text larger.  I am only 29 and feel sillywith such a complaint!!  Old setup was better - but I will stick with it!
B0091REZMW|3.0|I just started the game and then a add poled up and wanted a rate so here is a few stars for ya.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|A good read for those who want to view the world through the narrow sights of a highly motivated military specialist.
B009EEVMC8|5.0|Every time I see this movie it makes me tear up. He is sinless and He died and suffered for me !!
B0094K1MH2|4.0|nice movie that the family can enjoy without too much adult content added in to deter a young child from watching
B004S49YEM|4.0|Eye of the Needle is a good mystery with exiting plot and interesting ending. Most reader of all ages would enjoy this book.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|i was looking forward to a disappointment because of the character switch from one tree hill to this but i love how she showed up.
B000003NA3|5.0|This is just great...a more challenging listen than the Fearless Leader collection, I like to mix these discs in with some of the Bill Evans Vanguard collection for a Greenwich Village immersion experience.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I had been putting off ordering one of these but I'm glad I finally did.  This thing is stout.  I can't wait to really put it through the paces while camping this year.
B007B6VOG0|1.0|The only one star is for the smut.  I'm not uplifted by vulgarity.  I found this CD in the gutter...literally...I should've left it there.  Somebody else didn't like it either.  I don't care how many awards they win...if they can't do it without the bad language, I can't be a fan.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|I am a fan of the books. I am a fan of The Lord of the Rings movies. And I am indeed a fan of this movie! When I first read that Peter Jackson and his colleagues had decided to turn the story into a trilogy I wondered how it would be possible. But I am amazed at how the story has been flushed out. Many of the details of what has happened in Middle Earth are included in this film, so the audience is given a clearer of what's happening in the story. The action in this film is a great roller coaster ride of adventure. It is less epic than The Lord of the Rings movies, as the novel is less epic than The Lord of the Rings books. Martin Freeman is excellent as Bilbo Bagins. He truly portrays Bilbo's struggles with his desires to stay home in comfort and his desires for a great adventure. Ian McKellan delivers a fantastic performance as Gandalf. Sylvester McCoy as the brown wizard is not to be missed. If you're a fan of Middle Earth you've got to see this movie. I can't wait for the second installment.
B008G33NFC|5.0|When it comes to certain artists you always know the new material will be great as with Tarja . Weather with Nightwish, or solo always seems to please her fans.
0756697875|5.0|Grandson is always asking questions about Batman. I tell him about the original Batman during the sixties, so I ordered the series.
B0000X2DMA|5.0|I love Epica and Simone Simmons. Their production standards and their style are awesome. I love classical, musicals, rock, metal and other genres and this stuff is on the top of my lists. This was the last album of theirs I did not have but knew the music from the fabulous DVD, &#34;We Will Take You with Us&#34;.
0756666937|5.0|It keeps him busy and quiet. Shows me he has built with the Legos by using the book. My time to relax.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|Even my 4 year old grandson doesn't find this game very amusing.  There is really no challenge to this game
B005FHXB0O|5.0|One of the best movies! Not your usual vintage Tony Scott style but creative auteurs can dip into different genres ands still pull it off. Highly recommended for Tarantino fans.
B00AYB20KI|3.0|The movie was ok.  The acting was good, but the story was a little weak.  More importantly, I dumped Netflix when Amazon started their streaming video service.  I'm a prime member and this video service is great.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Very nice, light, simple headphones.  This is just what I wanted to go along with my new iPod Shuffle.  My goal this year is to get back in shape and these are perfect to go along with my workouts.  Last year I found myself with more umpf when working out with Sony DJ style headphones but they got way to bulky and I feared my sweat will damage the actual speakers.  With these I feel like eve if I damage them, they were worth every bit of it.  The sound is surprisingly good.  I was expecting very high highs and very soft mids but they pack a pretty good punch of everything.
B009AMAGQM|2.0|Time and time again, I find myself getting hyped when I first catch wind that one of my favorite novels are being re-imagined for the big screen, and each time I leave the experience wondering why I even continue to bother supporting bad movie adaptations. This film falls into that classification. The novel itself, although not a masterpiece, manages to catch the readers attention, stringing them along with one suspenseful moment after the next, and yet the movie decided to throw all that intrigue out the window, instead deciding to follow the path of \\"Twilight\\" and similar young adult/supernatural romance stories that seem to be taking cinemas by storm in recent years. The story itself, or at least the more complex layers that existed beyond the romance element (not to be confused into thinking the romance elements were not present in the original novel, yet they were more appropriately distributed) seemed to be forgotten, and where they were included, they seemed rushed and left hanging.<br /><br />Not to go into too much spoiler material, the movie opens with a few select lines from the novel, which played well to the fans of the novels, but I'm sorry to inform you that this brief narration will become the high point of the entire film. What follows are a series of mismatched scenes, enacted by a cast that felt as thought they were trying to hard to portray larger-than-life characters (one of the novel's strong suits was creating characters that were personable and had likable traits) and an atmosphere that was both dark and humorous. The visual effects looked overdone and lost their realistic edge at many crucial scenes throughout.<br /><br />Overall, I would not suggest making the film your first impression of the otherwise engaging young adult novel series. Personally, I find myself both relieved that I decided to pick up the books prior to the movies release and disappointed that filmmakers continue to disregard the greater part of the author's vision, instead focusing on aspects that are trending with audiences.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|Childhood's End is considered one of the classics of science fiction's Golden Age, and for good reason. It evokes, as most of the Golden Age material did, a sense of wonder and delight, and a promising, if ununderstood, future for mankind. The use of an alien in the standard image of Satan as the key character, was not only unorthodox at the time, but portended Clarke's future influence on the science fiction field.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|The characters are well developed and the ensemble cast plays so well together. The stories are engaging and credible. Makes me want to live in a time when things moved much more slowly.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful acting- feel as if I know them all personally, wonderful set, wonderful story lines!  Can't wait for Season 4!!!
B00B2G2RG6|1.0|I couldnt get past all the gruesome scenes.<br /> There are other ways to do the series. Dexxter is much better!
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Fine presentation of the man and very interesting info on his life previousy not known. I would  recomend it to any one  who remembers his work.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|i am not usually a fan of period pieces but the characters and story is SOOO good.<br /><br />It is such a nice change from all the shows out there and lets you step back in time to a simpler time.<br /><br />Can't wait for season 2!
B0018LMKIK|5.0|Not comprehensive, but a good &#34;Best of&#34; sampling - just what I wanted for work.  Have loved CCR's music for years, and it is a nice addition to my &#34;office collection.&#34;  I play it a lot, and it's a great introduction to the group for younger co-workers - who do enjoy the music - and a frequent conversation starter for people who like to &#34;remember when.&#34;  Good sound quality and good price.
B00BL5EQLC|4.0|I received this app as an Amazon App of the Day. It is a fun obstacle avoidance scrolling platformer with a campaign mode. The campaign mode ends somewhat shortly, but there is an endless survival mode.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Enjoyable game, quick thinking and fun.  Have some issues &#34;unlocking&#34; the challenge section though and instructions are not as specific as I would like.  Also, it would be fun to have a running tally of last 3/4 games in the timed section.  Overall, I would recommend it.
B009NF54ZE|2.0|I ordered this game and I never received it on my kindle fire HD... I know it is a good game because my husband purchased it... I'm pretty sure it's compatible with Kindle Fire,or at least I hope so.  Thank you,Melissa Sprinkle
B0015ABRE2|5.0|I found this 3rd series to be kinda off after the first two being so exciting!  I still like Dexter though.  Better than average tv stuff.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|What an amazing story of the struggles faced by Adam Brown and his lifelong battle to overcome his unfortunate decision to experiment with drugs in his youth.  One poor decision that led to a lifelong battle to recover his life.  I purchased this book to read about a military hero which was well told by the author.  What I didn't expect was to be more impressed by his effort to overcome his past and willingness to share his struggle with others.  So many young people face the same decisions in life and many made the unfortunate decision to experiment with drugs leading to lifelong difficulties.  Adam was fortunate to get a second chance and courageous enough to take advantage of that opportunity.  I would highly recommend this book for anyone who has a family member or friend dealing with the struggles to overcome poor decisions in their youth.  I enjoy reading about the people who serve our country in the military who have my utmost respect and appreciation.  The book met my expectations regarding Adam Browns military service, but I was even my impressed with his life story.  Thank you to all of the military who serve our country and God Bless all he gave their lives for our country.  Thank you to Adam Brown and his family for sharing his story.
034580404X|4.0|While each book is different, and I did like some better than others, as a series these were a compelling read.  I stayed up late more than once because I just could not put the book down.  The writing style is simple but easy to read.  For Book 1, you can identify with the characters quickly and you get a very good glimpse into the BSDM lifestyle.  The first book is all sex and steamy scenes.  Book 2, the plot really starts to develop and it keeps moving along but the \\"fantasy\\" starts to take new heights.  By Book 3, I grew weary of the \\"perfect world\\" the characters seemed to live in (no issue went unsolved and the main characters always walked away with the situation ending on a high note) but as a series these books were compelling enough to keep me reading at a nice pace from start to finish. In the end this is a fantasy love story with a little bit of bondage sex served on the side.  I thought they were worth the price and the time to read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I simply love this show! It is both funny and you feel for all of the characters. Cant wait for the next season.
B0077EBWVI|5.0|I loved the remake!  I thought I would hate it since I am a huge Kevin Bacon/Footloose fan.  It proved to be jusy as entertaining!!!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Quick read. Fun story. Not exactly a page turner but entertaining. I borrowed it from the library. Probably wouldn't recommend buying it.
B00BF11STU|3.0|This movie was not a bad movie but not much different from \\"seal team six\\". It was hard to stay interested.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Danzel Washington is always a great actor but thought the story line lacked. This is ok for a rent but would not buy.
B00BI5IXL4|4.0|Not crazy about all the singing but was a great movie and interesting reproduction of one of my favorite novels.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This movie is will worth watching. The end result will surprise and insightful. Photography and animation is astounding. the acting was also very good.
B007JRUCGO|5.0|Okay, I love this movie. I loved the first one, but the second is better. SPOILER ALERT: It has more songs than the first, and I don't feel like strangling the penguin head elder, or whatever he is, like I did in the first one, because in this one he's nice. The first one was kind of frustrating, because the others gave Mumble such a hard time. This one is about Mumble's family, Gloria, and their son, Erik. What happened to the parents, I don't know.  Of course, Lovelace is back, so is Ramone and his friends, along with some new characters, the elephant seal and beachmaster, Brian, Ramone's love interest, Carmen, 2 hilarious krills, and another bird masquarading as a penguin, Sven. The ending is, of course, happy, with the penguins being freed from their ice prison, that was caused by the ice caps melting, and making the ice shift. (I hope that made sense-it's kind of hard to explain). The cast is cool, with Elijah Wood back as Mumble, Pink as Gloria, and Robin Williams as Lovelace and Ramone.  But here's my question, and I hope someone can answer it.  On the internet, it says that John Goodman is the voice of the beachmaster, but then it says someone else is, too. And the video doesn't even have him listed. So, is he in it, or not? And if so, who's voice does he do? Anybody know?
B0064MGU98|4.0|Somehow I missed the premiere episode and just never bothered. When I saw the first three seasons were available through Amazon Prime, I jumped at the opportunity to check it out...already up to episode 7 of season 2... Really enjoying it.
B00AJLHUYO|3.0|It was interesting and the ending seems to be the norm now. Would've enjoyed it more if things turned out better. Still it was a good watch. I don't want to give anything away :)
B000FC2L1E|5.0|The best historical book I ever read. I can't wait to read the next in the series.  All of the books were great.
B0052GACNM|5.0|I have loved Tony Bennett for over 49 years he is the very best, yes he is the very best.
630529142X|5.0|This movie is classic! I love it! The seller shipped it out quickly and arrived within a few short days, in the condition described by the seller. Just amazing. I definitely recommend this movie for anyone who needs a really good laugh
B008AK8FHM|3.0|It gets a little too technical in places, but overall a good read.  I was hoping for more of what it was like to experience heaven.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this great for young kids and even adults. it teaches kids the responsibilities of taking care of an animal. and they have fun in the process of learning.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|He's really quite hard in this game, it's the best to the PC version. Lots of fun to be had.
0120884674|5.0|Completely impressed by the details included in the book. For someone starting Osteology, it can be very intimidating but the guide will break down everything in very easy terms. Very resourceful.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|The only thing wrong with the Maze Runner is that I couldn't put it down.  I can't wait to start the next book in the series!
B000XFCPHI|4.0|My favorite movie! My son bought this and made me a cd. I love it! However the music is not the same as the movie, its a bit more theatrical I prefer the original soundtrack.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|This was a very good book for someone who likes adventure books,people like me who love action books this would be perfect.
B0086700CM|5.0|This free app for my kindle fire is great for passing the time.  It is fun and fast paced.  would be great for kids and teenagers on car trips  Easy to play and entertaining
1400049628|5.0|Great book lots of good info. Made me think. Good information for general disaster preparations. Would recommend to any one.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|I really enjoy listening to Phil Collins. The cd is excellent, all the songs that i enjoy are on there. It arrived in excellent condition and in a timely manner.
B0050PYNN0|5.0|loved it truly appeciative film  couldn't find a finer film. Ten more words required now go out and buy it!
B0010VXOXS|5.0|After releasing  the regular  issue the queens always do a tour addition. I must have for any true queens fan.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|Better than I thought it would be! I love how the story is set in the future 126 years after WW4. Cinder is not anything like Bella from Twilight or others like that. Cinder kicks ass
B00B5P37IG|1.0|The channel choices are very limited and I would not recommend purchasing this app. I was hoping to get ESPN and that was not an option.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|Enjoyed the insight to this mass production!!!  You get to see Michael at work and backstage of the tour that never materialized.
B001EN71DQ|4.0|People need to understand that you can't keep repeating the phenomenon with the same franchise<br />over and over again!<br />I personally enjoyed these movies!<br />Star Wars; Episode 1: The Phantom Menace<br />What I liked was:<br />1. Darth Maul was just scary and cool (my favorite Star Wars character)!<br />2. All the actors did their best to bring their characters to life!<br />3. The action was exciting!<br />4. The Pod Race was awesome!<br />5. The visual effects were stunning!<br /><br />What I didn't like was:<br />1. The movies pace dragged at times!<br />2. Although the Pod Race was awesome, the whole movie seemed to stop it's plot<br />for the race to take place!<br />3. Jar Jar Binks was just annoying!<br /><br />Overall, it is a welcome edition to the Star Wars universe, but had potential<br />to be a bit more than it was...<br />My grade: B or three-and-a-half stars!<br /><br />Star Wars: Episode 2; Attack of the Clones<br />Better than 'The Phantom Menace' but still lacked the flowing pace<br />of the first three movies!<br />What I liked was:<br />1. The battle on Geonosis was awesome!<br />2. We see that Yoda can be lethal!<br />3. The battle between Jango Fett and Obi-Wan Kenobi was great!<br />4. Again the visual effects were amazing!<br />5. The plot(for the most part) flowed through well!<br />6. The individual plots tied in-together well through out the movie!<br /><br />What I didn't like was:<br />1. The movie's pace was a little too slow at times.<br /><br />Overall: This was a very entertaining movie! More entertaining than the last one!<br />My grade: B+ or four stars!<br /><br />Star Wars; Episode 3: Revenge Of The Sith<br />Probably the most intense of the prequels!<br />What I liked about this movie was:<br />1. The battles were awesome!<br />2. Once again the visual effects were astonishing!<br />3. General Grievous was a great villain!<br />4. Five light saber duels in one Star Wars movie?!?! How cool<br />is that for fans!<br /><br/>What I didn't like was:<br />1. In 'Return of the Jedi', Leia said that she remembered her 'real' mother from when she<br />was very young, but in this this movie Padme' dies right after she is born! That was clearly<br />a plot glitch!<br />2. The movie had a few slow parts in it!<br /><br />Overall: I recommend this movie to any Star Wars fan as much as I would recommend the second movie!<br />My grade B+ or four stars!<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />All three of these movie may not be as fully satisfying as episodes 4,5,and 6, but are still very<br />fun to watch! All three of them are great movies!<br />My overall grade is: B+ or four stars!
B0009VSB06|5.0|This a great way to start out on your metal detecting adventure! Garrett products are very well made and are very easy to use!!!!
1401201911|4.0|First things first, I'm not an avid comic book reader (ie I have only read Watchmen). Take that as you may with my review.<br /><br />My interest in this comic is because of the premise. I enjoy reading sci-fi with interesting twists, and Superman Red Son delivers in this aspect. I do not know much of the DC Universe, Superman is definitely not one of my favorites, but I appreciate authors who are willing to take some creative licenses in order to craft intriguing worlds in which some stereotypes are subverted.<br /><br />There is something very appealing in having a popular American superhero having a different impact and attitude just because he had a different upbringing (amongst other things).<br /><br />Regarding the art style, I particularly enjoyed a lot the colors employed, they are definitely eye catching.<br /><br />My only gripe with this comic? Maybe I'm not used to reading them, so I felt it was a little on the short side. There are some sequences that should have been longer. But this isn't necessarily bad because by being short the pacing is tight.
B000FA675C|5.0|I was hooked from the first few pages. While never a strong history student, I've always been interested in religions and symbology. And being a math major and cryptology enthusiast, I feel like this book was written solely for my enjoyment. Some of the puzzles were predictable, but in all this book was thoroughly enjoyable. I look forward to rereading this book often.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a very fun game! My friend suggested I get it and now I can't stop playing!!! She did warn me that would happen:D
B003UYUP58|5.0|Just an amazing book.  Wonderfully written, easily readable and detailed.  Siddhartha Mukherjee's book was recommended by my personal physician.  My only regret is how long it took me to begin reading!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|The purists might not like this show (Watson is a girl in this version) but it is well-produced.  Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu have a good chemistry.  While British Sherlock shows are pretty good there aren't enough of them produced within a year for a hungry mystery-loving audience.  The complete season is worth purchasing.
B004GYY714|5.0|Since I have and use the Pro version of this app (black background avatar), I cannot say anything bad about TuneIn Radio.  I like it, as it finds stations that may not exist on other services --like KNAC-- so, I consequently get to listen to what I want.  I wish we had something like the Kindle Fire HD when I was a kid, then I could pull in stations from around the world to my pleasure.
B006R8GK2Q|2.0|The game is fun enough.... But I get about three or four scenes into it, and the scenes get stuck. The plot and story line keep moving, but the scene in the background stops changing with it. Rather disappointing. I have tried removing it from my kindle fire and reinstalling... but it doesn't help.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Wow!if u like a good strategy game or mystery game you will you will abyss, cant wait for the next installment
1452110581|4.0|This is a cute collection of poems.....for a cat lover like me! The idea is so cat-like and the photos are an added joy.
B0038TRGSY|5.0|One of My favorite musicals ever! My family and I enjoyed this movie! I will watch it over and over again!
B00BTHV05M|5.0|Every song on this album is good. The artist did a great job on the entire album.  Definitely recommend it!
B0041B4B8G|5.0|amazingggggg! so funny. allot of extra material, deleted scenes. bet Will Ferrell movie to this day. i canwatch it over and over!
B008133MDK|5.0|I have seen my share of detective dramas on tv but this one is the best! What I find very unique and satisfying is that it runs for one and hour and does justice to sir Arthur's story! Not only the plot but I enjoy rich production value and music and how sherlock's thoughts/deductions are unfolded in the story.
B003SNKBXW|5.0|It's definitely one of my favourite books! Mysterious, intelligent and incredibly well written (love dialogues!). Definitely recommend it to anybody who likes reading and books.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This by far to me is the best note app I've used and I have 3 downloaded to my droid devices. I just sync them to evernote and it's saved to my computer. Love how you can include pictures and pdf files. Great app!
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|We're talking about the usual cycle of bad guys vs good guys stuff here with a kind of Robo Cop twist.  Lots of killing and blood and gore and splats. Dredd, of course, is the usual badass of badasses, neatly polishing off one bad guy after another.  No real surprises here but makes for a fun enough ride nevertheless.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I have to admit that I've been a little obsessed with slenderman since I saw a documentary... I saw this game for free and I was like yeah let's go!  Then I played it. Holy crap I started crying I was s o scared.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Very dark and serious, but Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery.  To this Bond fan who was reading the books before the first Broccolization of 007,  the Daniel Craig pics are far truer to my personal idea of James Bond than any of their semi-comic predecessors.  My one bit of evidence of more serious intent was the appearance of the china bulldog on M's desk-- I had just seen it on Control's desk in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.  Both  John le Carr&eacute;  and  Ian Fleming are said to have had some real-life experience with MI6, and in terms of &#34;truthiness&#34; I'd rank them Carr&eacute;  Fleming, and  the movies.  Sure there's a nod to the goofiness of the quartermaster and the some of the traditional Bond shtick, but overall I found the characters to be much more believable. Can't wait to see what's next for the newest James Bond.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Children go nuts for this game!!!!They practically take over my kindle when they get a chance at this game. I love it too!!!!
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Definitely worth .99. Response is faster than free version any day. Keeps me entertained for hours on end. I hate having to review everything though. Gets very old.
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|IIt was a hit for a 3rd grade sleepover! The kids played the Guardians after the movie. Made us appreciate Jack Frost a little bit more after a winter of almost 70\\" of snow and an unheard of 4 snow days.<br />I would recommend in HD, but I am only a novice in this area.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|No imagination.  Tell me if you thought about Born identity at some point(a cheep shot)...how the hell did they roped Javier Bardem In to this flop is beyond me.
B000IKQMFO|5.0|Ok I admit it...I love Agatha Christie, Jane Austen, all things English...great escape and such incredibly entertaining actors. Wonderful ensemble cast and of course Maggie Smith is marvelous...murder in a country manor.
0786890762|4.0|This is the second book I've read by this author. Surprisingly, P.S. I Love You was not the first book I read. Love her style of writing. She keeps your hooked, and you can't put it down. Its funny, charming and sometimes even sad. You can't help but fall in love with Rosie and all her missed opportunities.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Wonderful cast, incredible cinematography, everything perfectly wonderful except plot line...spoiler alert that the world is aware of...they killed Matthew! Unbelievable!
030758836X|5.0|I loved this book ,I couldn't put it down. Before I finished it I ordered her other two books and loved them all. I can't wait for her next book.
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|Ok for a movie but just doesn't live up to the book. Probably would love it if I hadn't read the book and granted the trilogy is so much of incredible images it would be hard for a movie to measure up...but if you love this movie and haven't read the books...please don't miss the books!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I found the book to be hard to follow in the beginning.  I almost did not read it but it finally got better but did not enjoy the ending.<br />I would not recommend.
B005URRCUY|5.0|Definitely a more produced sound than their earlier records, but I think it's a nice continuation out of the &#34;Brothers&#34; album. Lots of grooves, and plenty of low-down dirty guitars.
B003ZHQVJO|2.0|Some musicians get older and try to diversify and explore their &#34;other sides&#34;.  Most don't do that very successfully, and I think this falls in that category.  It's just not the Kid Rock people grew up loving, and there's nothing outstanding enough to draw in a new generation of fans from a different musical genre.  There's nothing on this album that jumps out at me.  I listened twice, just to try and like it.  It hasn't played again since.  I really don't miss the Kid Rock &#34;rap&#34; Detroit blah-blah stuff.  It's hard to live up to songs like &#34;Cowboy&#34;, &#34;Bullgod&#34;, &#34;Prodigal Son&#34;, and more recently &#34;All Summer Long&#34; and &#34;Lowlife&#34;, but you have to stick to what you're good at.  I read other reviews that over-discussed and &#34;production&#34; aspect.  It's hard to say, unless you're a musical insider, just how much was the artist's input, and how much was production's fault.  Either way, it's background noise to me.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I loved how challenging this game is and the plot of the game. I also like how you can change the level of how hard you want the game to be.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|This is a great time killer. It is a match three game with nice graphics. It becomes more difficult as you advance, but I've only had to replay one screen and I'm quite far along. I have not found out how to save my spot yet, but there must be a way. This would be great to have in the airport while waiting for your plane!
B00AB2NYNC|5.0|My daughter requested a cd by this group.  She loved the music and was excited that a dvd was also included.
B000JMKO3C|5.0|Great books. I really like Coelho`s style of writing. This book is fascinating in the way it gives insight into \\"vitriol poisoning\\" and raises questions about conforming to social norms and its effects on one's sanity.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I did not expect the book to follow along the course it took.  It was nothing spectacular until the end.
B0082Z447U|3.0|It is interesting to read 19th century prose.  It took a while for me to wrap myself around  the verbosity but I soon became  engrossed in the unusual manor the story unfolded.  It is nice to read a good mystery without gross violence.
1452101248|5.0|IT can't be a coincidence that Mr. Ottolenghi is a non-vegetarian who happens to love vegetables but also loves food that is rich and hearty in ways that are similar to animal-meat meals. His stuffed onion and stuffed cabbage dishes are worth the price of the book on their own. And I appreciate that the author tells us which countries his dishes derive from -- and then explains how he's deviating from tradition. I have tried seven or eight of the recipes in this book, and each one has been great.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book !!! I didn't know what to expect and this has me ready to read the last one. Continue to write books please.
030758836X|2.0|Not sure what all the rave reviews were about for this novel, as it was torture getting through it. (I listed via audio) and it was so long and drawn out. No story or structure, just hours of psycho crazy babble from this miserable couple (another sleeping with enemy except it was the man with the crazy woman). Some parts were funny; however, mostly cursing and complaining and crazy thoughts of how to torture someone. It would take someone kinda nuts to even write this. Guess this is not my kind of book; however, since I heard so many reviews about it wanted to get through it. Would not recommend and doubt I will read any of her other books. There are many great books out there, so why waste your time hearing about crazy thoughts of a man and woman which are both nuts. Hated the ending as well. I prefer a real novel.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is amazing! It is super entertaining,fun,cool<br />Fast,efficient and just amazing. I love playing it, and I cannot stop playing it.<br /> I rate this product 5 because it is addicting,nice,has good graphics,<br /> And it has cool characters. It is a bit hard at first but once you get used to<br />It it is really really really fun.
B0018O4YT0|5.0|If you like SCFI then you should check out this movie. Very interesting plot and wonderful acting. Glad to add this to my video collection.
B007T99ENE|4.0|Ian McEwan once again ropes in the reader with the intrigue of secret service activities back in the days of the Cold War and industrial unrest in Britain. His characters are certainly not perfect human beings, but they are interesting - or quirky - depending upon your visualisation of them. He keeps you wondering about the wisdom of the central character's activities, and whether the girl gets the boy. You'll have to read to the end to find the answer to that. But well worth the read.
0066620996|5.0|I got this book on a recommendation of my boss.  It is in great condition with lots of excellent material in it.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Lots of nudity, but done very tastefully, and essential to the story.  Not for kids, but an inspiring story for adults.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The storyline and characters were fascinating, and I loved the spot-on social commentary. I loved and hated the characters. I'm looking forward to reading another book by Flynn.
1400069807|5.0|Excellent and informative.  Brought to the forefront the<br />importance of monitoring your intake of Salt, Sugar, and Fat<br />and eating a healthful diet.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game!  Didn't take long to get used to the controls. I love the fact opportunity Super<br /><br />I Mario and this hits the nail on the head.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I wish it had a few more features, like scoring and timekeeping, but it is still a fun game to pass the time.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven is a wonderful and beautiful story about forgiveness and love. It's about hope and overcoming your circumstances,taking hold of your life and becoming who you were meant to be. I recommend this book to anyone looking for an inspirational love story that will change their life.

B00B69UQEO|5.0|I am not going to give an in depth review. Others have already done that. I am enjoying this collection a great deal.  There is not one bad track on the 2 cd set. Everyone is terrific.
B007V693YK|3.0|There is a great defference from Songsterr reached by a PC and by this applet.<br />It works well, but hasn't any of the useful features of the original site.<br />And it do not connect your account.<br />Anyway I think that are only problem related to the release.<br />Hopefully the next releases will be more cose to the &#34;PC version&#34;  :)
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Storyline: Seven noble families fight for control of the mythical land of Westeros. Political and sexual intrigue is pervasive. Robert Baratheon, King of Westeros, asks his old friend Eddard, Lord Stark, to serve as Hand of the King, or highest official. Secretly warned that the previous Hand was assassinated, Eddard accepts in order to investigate further. Meanwhile the Queen's family, the Lannisters, may be hatching a plot to take power. Across the sea, the last members of the previous and deposed ruling family, the Targaryens, are also scheming to regain the throne. The friction between the houses Stark, Lannister and Baratheon, and with the remaining great houses Greyjoy, Tully, Arryn, and Tyrell, leads to full-scale war. All while a very ancient evil awakens in the farthest north. Amidst the war and political confusion, a neglected military order of misfits, the Night's Watch, is all that stands between the realms of men and icy horrors beyond.<br /><br />I'm really glad I purchased the DVD for this program - trying to keep track of seven intriguing families in a medieval setting can be quite a stretch, and really needs to be viewed more than once. The 'Episode Guide', included with the boxed set, and features family trees, is a real help. Add a little 'fantasy' to the story, and the production becomes even more interesting.<br /><br />The HBO production is First Rate. The sets are done in a semi-permanent method, and locations are in several different countries, including Iceland. Sets, locations, acting, costumes and make-up all show the attention to detail that is needed to make a believable project.  &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34; and &#34;World Without End&#34; are two other recent efforts (Tandem Productions/Sony Pictures Home Entertainment) that also show what can be done to provide great entertainment.<br /><br />My favorite actor in this series has got to be Peter Dinklage, who plays Tyrion Lannister, and is often referred to as 'The Imp' due to his 'short stature'. He is thought to be a hedonistic fool, but he is really nobody's fool. He is the canniest character of the bunch, and always seems to maneuver himself into the most advantageous position. He is hedonistic, but that just adds to the fun of watching a good actor. His acting prowess in the first season, earned him much higher billing in the second.hort stature'.

0345803507|2.0|Better than the original but still bad. I am not recommending this to anyone, and I am being generous when i give it 2 stars
0380789019|4.0|After reading two great Neil Gaiman books, I decided I needed to read everything the man's written. So I picked up something outside of YA sci-fi/fantasy (I know *gasp*!), but it turns out I didn't go very far outside. Neverwhere is definitely something that adults and \\"young adults\\" can read and enjoy.<br /><br />The main character is 20-something Richard Mayhew (so I guess by today's genre terms, that would make it a \\"new adult\\"novel); Richard has just started to get his life launched, moved to London, got himself a cushy office job, and a demanding girlfriend when he decides to help an injured girl and gets sucked into the world of London below. He loses everything in his normal life, and like Dorothy in some sort of upside down, subterranean-version of Oz, he starts on a quest to get home again.<br /><br />The world of London below that Gaiman builds in Neverwhere is by far the best part of the novel. London below is filled with imaginative and frightening people from rat-speakers to homeless counts and subway earls. It's a seedy, dangerous, magical world, and it is totally captivating.  However, the story itself was a little disappointing. While Gaiman's children's books like Coraline have a simple, elegant power, I didn't find the story of Neverwhere to be nearly as compelling. The main character is a bit flat, and he's often carried-along by the narrative instead of active within it.<br /><br />That said, Neverwhere is well worth reading for its magical world alone. And there are few writers that can match the depth, detail and originality of Gaiman's imagination.<br /><br />This review can also be found on my blog at sarazaske.wordpress.com.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Because, it is good and very nice to play and also love by children and experience good quality of games.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This my &#34;go to&#34;  for storing info, I use it frequently,  I also like the fact you don't have to be a rocket scientist to use it
B000FCJZ3G|5.0|I laughed out loud and thought hard while reading this book.  It consistently challenged me to re-think my long-standing views and consider something different.  I will definitely attend a seminar and re-read this book over and over again.  I now have a multi-millionaire mind.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game!!! I love how its a world tour!  If you like temple run you will love this game!  Many cool characters and boards!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game is very addictive. Just the excitement of collecting all of the prizes and receiving the special coins keep me coming back. I play this game practically every night.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Really is a fun game but depends to much on cash, you get some as you play but only a little and slowly if you buy any it's expensive. Very fun otherwise, quickly outgrew the area I started with and trying to expand.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|I downloaded this and played for awhile then I had to delete it not good not good not good not good
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|It's an enjoyable movie and my 4 year old nephew glued to it the whole time. It's cute and fun, but it's not the kind that you find yourself thinking about after it's over.
B0083ZRAJS|1.0|I know it is considered a kid's classic...but the writing is poor, bland and maddeningly repetitive...the characters are very flat and largely unlikable... Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was a far superior story, both in terms of style and development
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Good way to pass the time, nice graphics, would recommend again and again,Cuts, fun, worth the time and the efforte
B000002V1D|5.0|I love Duran Duran and can't believe it took me this long to buy The Wedding Album. It is such a great cd!
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Good story with livel action to hold my interest.  The weakest part is that the film didn't deal enough with the plight of the common people before and after the game's end.  The book, as in most cases, is probably better than the film.  It was an enhanced Lottery that Shirley Jackson might enjoy.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|This is the best Depeche mode album since Violator. Exceeded all my expectations!! I actually bought two of the deluxe cds (one for me and my wife).  This is a must have CD for anyone who enjoys alternative music

B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I found this book to be a fairly easy read and enjoyed the sections dealing with the main character, Jamie. Though references are made to the abuse he suffered as a child, very little graphic detail is included. So, readers can sympathize without having having to feel the struggle of experiencing the violence with him. Although I enjoyed some of the other characters, they were a bit stereotypical, the other principal character lacks the depth of detail and while the ending is nice, there are enough details for you to figure it out well ahead of time and it feels very contrived. That said, I enjoyed the journey as an easy read.
0802473156|5.0|It is uncanny how the author tells you what you are thinking,  And it never occurred to me that my wife and I spoke different \\"languages\\"!  But with insight and care, Chapman tells us what each is saying, what we are meaning and how it is coming across to the spouse.  Great message, worth several re-reads.  Keep it on hand for a reference.<br />Reminds me a little of \\"The Blessing\\" and reads like it.
B0099Y2MYK|1.0|We already own the first two seasons and are looking ahead to viewing this third season as well. Thank you.
B0009W5JR8|5.0|This was all action pact my favorite part of the movie was  the time win he had to fined a way off tat aircraft care with out being killed. I also like the part ere he win back to hi farm to get the hard drive.. the ho movie was ex=lent. .
B0091REZMW|3.0|The game has good graphics. And quests to keep u busy. But soon u lose energy. Also u r going to need a lot of diamonds to get keys so u can access some rooms. Which can get really annoying and expensive. Getting &quot;friends&quot; is easy. Although the game seems to close itself every other time. Which is also annoying.
B009ANP4F4|5.0|Step Up Revolution  these kids do know how  to have fun and tell there story also. love it.<br />The story is about not just danceing but they are trying to tell the Meyer that they and there famleys live there also.
B00BSW6F26|1.0|I thought this would be a good game, but I was 100% wrong. There are no hits so your on your own in trying to find what your looking for. I over paid for this app, even if it was free the price is too high. I dont know about other games are put out by the company that made this one but I will think twice before getting one. It's said that you get what you pay for....in this case I got less.

The wonderful ballad &#34;A Thousand Years,&#34; that was sung over the final scene and credit; the hysterical &#34;Antidote&#34; that played during the arm wrestling scene with Emmett; and the haunting &#34;Everything and Nothing.&#34;<br /><br />I was glad I got the CD and was able to listen to the entire song, and now have the CD in my car.

B003ZZAXFO|4.0|It has the song on there that I wanted. It completes my Peter Gabriel collection of songs to own or have.
B007V5CF5K|4.0|Was enjoying it until the scene with the sick native. The code to start the conveyor belt (for the coal) doesn't work no matter which numeric code you enter AND you can't skip! So now I am stuck with a game I purchased but can't play to the end. Frustrated and need a fix or refund.

B004XUMMFE|4.0|My grown children think this is the best series ever, so I decided to try it.  Wasn't impressed by the first few episodes.  They were ok, not great.  But, as I got to the end of the first season, the last couple of episodes changed my mind.  I am looking forward to the next season.  I've gotten to know some of the characters and more of where they came from.  I don't know if I will think this is the best series ever, but I believe I will enjoy future seasons.

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|The storyline and graphics are awesome. I was hooked from the start. Free version was what got me to purchase the full version. Great job G5

B004MC8CA2|5.0|There are the big old fashioned, somewhat fancy family Bibles, and the small tiny font Bibles that are usually still bigger than a romance novel, but to have a Bible with big letters, capable of fitting in my purse or back pocket even.  And i can go read a psalm or a letter from Paul.  Easy to locate verses, too.  It's nice to have a good book handy at all times.
B00A757EFW|5.0|the free version only has the first two screens.  but after buying it, it continues just like the 80's arcade game

B005HJWWW8|4.0|I purchased this unit to see if it would help my headphones sound better as I saw other reviews that claimed that this could help a little. The theory behind that is that your audio source does not provide enough juice to your headphones to let them get the proper sound quality. This thing definitely gave more power over the headphones. But I don't think my headphones sounded better. That may just the headphones I had. I tried it with my friend's headphones and wow, it made the sound pop a bit more there.<br /><br />Overall, this thing does give more power. The battery lasted a long time for more (multiple hours). However, this unit does feel cheap and plasticy. The pictures made it look like a good quality. But it feels so fragile in my hands. Just a small quibble.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is really cool. You should get it. It's sort of like temple run, but there are three spaces you are moving from away from trains and jumping over stuff. The only thing is, it freaks me out. I always feel like I'll get hit by a train, and my father always asks me why I'm screaming. It's also a little glitchy, but the glitches are funny and sometimes helpful. Once, I ran into a train, and I just kept running, so I could escape.

B000NQRE9Q|4.0|This box set would have gotten five stars without a doubt if not for the above mentioned. Still, Indiana is a man's man, but Kingdom of the Crystal Skull? (Deeply disturbed sigh) I had to take a whole star rating off for that piece of excrement. Overall though, it's a beautiful product inside and out. I love everything else about this box set, and you will too, that's if you can avoid being blinded by The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Just don't look directly at it, kind of like the sun, ya know?
B004PHE9F6|5.0|I own both the two disk special edition and the Blu-ray versions of this movie. I had the special edition for several years before the Blu-ray came out. If you own a high def TV and a Blu-ray player this is one old movie worth the upgrade, the quality of the original film really comes through. I have tried going to Blu-ray on a few other older films like Le Mans and seen only marginal improvement, but this one really made a difference. I believe it has a lot the do with the 70mm Panovision cameras that were used to shoot this film. They were the cutting edge camera of their time, and the quality of the image really cannot be appreciated until you see it in high def. It's all the little details that really come through, like the dust on the cars and the little flaws in the drivers fire suits and helmets. I recommend it!
B000P0J09W|5.0|The Goonies is everything that Super 8 tried, but failed miserably to become. The Goonies is a charming and fun coming of age classic that has three major things that Super 8 did not, a compelling storyline, likable characters, and great dialogue.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|I don't know her name but i like this actress she brings a lot to the movies, This movie was well made, A feel good happy ending
B000YJ85BI|5.0|This is one of the few books that if Amazon had more than five stars, I'd click somewhere about 8 of 5. This book kept me reading when I really should have been putting it down to take care of a few other things. I don't do that often.<br /><br />Having read \\"Old Man's War\\", \\"The Ghost Brigades\\", and \\"The Last Colony\\" for the first time over just the last few days, I thought that this book was a perfect way to wrap up the overarching political story line ... not to mention some of the personal ones as well. This book essentially has three political viewpoints wrangling with each other, and as the author moves from one to the other, each time he speaks with the voice of that political faction, the reader has to reevaluate which one might be \\"right\\" all over again. LOL It's just brilliant plotting and writing.<br /><br />Critics of the book have one valid point. Through the middle portion of the book our intrepid colonists encounter an intelligent indigenous life form which might be a considerable threat, and at a certain point those natives do just disappear from the narrative ... in fact at a point where their involvement has reached a seeming climax. The story moves at that point from the more mundane survival concerns of the colony to the broader political story. There is an event in the story that could legitimately have made this threat of little future concern, and the author should probably have devoted a page of so of dialogue to wrap that up. Perhaps more existed originally on that plot line, but inadvertently got dumped in the editing process.<br /><br />However, that minor quibble doesn't stop me from recommending this book. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Personalities were rich and often at odds. Tactics were clever and surprising. The politics were intricate and fascinating. The ending is at once spunky and sensible.<br /><br />Read and enjoy.
B005C8ENI0|1.0|The Lincoln Lawyer<br /><br />I was unable to enjoy The LINCOLN LAWYER because the audio was not in sink with the lip movement.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|An incredible work of art. A round of applause to Macklemore and Ryan Lewis for an artistic musical composition worth sharing!
1616550414|5.0|This book is magnificent, it answers almost all of the questions I had about this game series, and much more information. I finally got to see the correct timeline and much more within it. It is a must have for Zelda fans. :)
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I watched the whole season in just a couple of days.  Great entertainment with a historical intrigue. Couldn't stop watching. Loved it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I downloaded this a few months ago. I have never had a problem with it (fire hd). Those who complain must have other conflicting issues or other battery apps. I use this to see how my battery is charging and discharging. It is also nice to see how I use my kindle, battery wise....to be sure I use the full charge all the way to empty before I charge again. Feel free and confident to download this helpful app.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book is a pick me upper. When I feel down about anything, this book would put a smile back on my face. It is super fun to read. So I know I will be reading this book over and over again. (However, I think this comment only applies to girls.)
B005ZUR724|5.0|This is one great game I love it because it reminds me of world of warcraft, great graphics with nice character customization imputed into the game, but the main thing is that I love to play this game.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love the hunger games trilogy! I stayed up all night reading all 3 books. Finished all in 1 week.
B000Y0Q5NM|4.0|The first season of Stargate SG1 was rough around the edges but in season 2 the series began to jell and take on a stronger coherence.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great. It's fun, adventurous, and sometimes challenging. I can't help but get excited when I get a boost, Easter egg, or mystery box. I love the game and if I have nothing to do, I like to play this. Awesome game I recommend it to anyone and everyone.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|I really enjoyed this animated movie about a well meaning but awkward video game character.  I had uncertain expectations when I began to watch it but I found the story line witty and engaging.  This movie can be enjoyed by adults and children alike.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much and I recommend it to everyone me and my friend call it ghetto temple run lol!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I have only read four of Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels, but this one is the best plot so far. After seeing Jack Reacher, the movie, I decided to check one of his stories. I began with the first and starting the fifth book. Great stories. I see them along the Jason Borne and Mission Impossible genre.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I LOVED this book!!! There was just enough suspense, sex and anxiousness to keep me on the edge of my seat the entire time.again I LOVED this book!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|It is a distracting diversion, but it sure has lots of great ideas! Reading the humorous section can really pick me up when I'm feeling low and there are tons of great crafts and activities to keep me and my two boys busy for years! Not to mention you can find tons of fattening food and ways to work off all of those extra calories all in the same place!
B008TMA1LY|5.0|my little girl loves it, but my teenage boy doesn't. ten more words required blah blah and other meaningless words
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|The re-boot of the classic BBC program. The Doctor returns in his 9th incarnation and meets his new companion, Rose.
B008JF8O9M|1.0|It hasn't printed anything that I sent to the printer. It tells me it's printed but the printer does nothing. I tried to make sure that it was my printer it recognized in &#34;scanning for printers&#34; but it won't give me any option to do it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Thie app is fun. I love dragons, so this is a great app to have. Glitches sometimes but still very fun
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it's a very addictive game. I don't like that to go up a level on some levels you have to beat a freind but other than that it's a great game
B004VMUS9G|5.0|it is absolutely great i love full version too but i just love waking up to my music! i really reccomend this!
0761163808|5.0|This is an incredibly beautiful book.  I fell in love with the copy we got from the library and promptly ordered two from Amazon - one for us and one for whatever lucky child next has a birthday party attended by my 6 year old son.  The illustrations MOVE and the book itself is lovely.  Inside you will find a cheetah, elephant, gorilla, and more.  We were all enchanted and I would recommend this for any child (or adult?!) who loves the animals of Africa.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good read. Kept reader wondering. Ending abrupt. Would have liked another chapter or two. Grisham puts together a good story.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is one of the most enjoyable shows I have ever watched!  I am really looking forward to season 4!!
B004GUSG4M|5.0|If you enjoy mystery, try living one daily. A highly involved story sets you to wonder or wander after the truth. Not a happy read, but a good one.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Great author fresh story filled with magic.  Best first person story I have read.  I am looking forward to more from this author.
B007HJ84ZK|1.0|I bought season one of Game of Thrones, and I was able to watch episode one.  After that, nothing.  I finally called Amazon and was told, \\"Yeah, we've been getting alot of calls about that.  Perhaps you could check back in 2-3 hours.\\" So I asked for my money back and that was greeted with, \\"Yeah, we've been getting alot of calls about that.  Perhaps you could check back in 2-3 hours.\\"  It was only after I insisted on a refund that the person on the phone would acquiesce. I love amazon.com, but I won't be buying videos from them again.
B000IZ6URY|4.0|What can I say. A good laugh if you want to poke fun at action movies, US foreign force, actors and terrorists.
