B001DHXT20|5.0|MARVEL DOES IT AGAIN! You would think making some cartoons into movies wouldn't work  that well but this one did.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love this series!  I love it for the culture and for the very accurate history.  I learned a lot while enjoying the drama!
B002UM5BXW|4.0|Bourdain's dry humor and occasional self-deprecation lend themselves perfectly to this book, half-memoir of a checkered culinary past and half-treatise on the core qualities of a kitchen staff. The author hints at the travelogues to come in a zany chapter about a trip to Tokyo, which overflows in poetic ode to a multitude of food. I'll definitely be checking out \\"A Cook's Tour\\" which expands upon Bourdain's love of travel and all things edible.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The ending blew me away. I am a mother and I don't know that I could have done what Laurie did. Even if I knew for sure.
B0063IH60K|5.0|i have always loved playing solitare with cards but this is just awesome!!!!absolutely love it!!!!! ty keep up the great work.  u guys rock!!!!
B003PIUC02|1.0|Bluerays do not work in either one of my blueray players, even update players online.  Not sure what kind of blueray players these need to be played in.  I bought the first three seasons and have the same issue with all three.  As far as Sparticus is concerned it is action packed and very entertaining.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I missed most of season 1, so I got the dvd. Have since become addicted to this great, extremely entertaining series.
B005NFJAT4|5.0|i like watching a true story and history because i learn any experiance a caracter in film to my life
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I loved the book.  Full of twists, typical Grisham.  I can see this as a movie too.  I can just imagine them living happily ever after.
0711225176|5.0|I choose this rating because this is a five star book.<br /><br />  I find nothing to dislike at this bargain basement price.<br /><br />  What I like about this book is :<br /><br />  1. Production Quality For Artists.<br /><br />  2. Photograph journalism for Art Historians.<br /><br />  3. I have not reviewed the text as I am a Painter, however, I will probably amend this review in five years.***
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Excellent story coupled with a good ole fashion cowboy shoot em up.  Jamie Foxx makes a excellent cowboy and Leonardo was incredible.

B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is great I love it! Its very intriguing and adicting but you must be patient to play Mystery Manor.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A wonderful story! I'm so glad I bought it as a whole (1-5). I would not have been able to wait for installments. I highly recommend this!

B001DCN178|5.0|I needed a mini-MIDI keyboard with the ability to send the full set of MIDI commands, and the Behringer UMA25S U-Control 25-key USB mini-MIDI keyboard controller does everything, which is quite handy for working on digital music production software like NOTION 4 (Notion Music) and Digital Performer 8 (MOTU).<br /><br />The keys are touch sensitive, but they can be configured in different ways, where in one configuration pressing softly on a key maps to a soft note but pressing hard on a key maps to a loud note.  I prefer the configuration where the velocity is fixed, which maps to notes always being played at full volume and requires only a tiny touch to play notes.  The way the keys respond to touch is configured by pressing one of the buttons and then selecting among four choices, which is done with one of rotary knobs across the top-right of the mini-MIDI keyboard.<br /><br />There is an LED display (red), which is another reason I selected this mini-MIDI keyboard, since it is helpful to be able to see the value when adjusting and setting various MIDI parameters and so forth.<br /><br />Yet another outstanding aspect of this mini-MIDI keyboard is that it has both USB and standard MIDI ports, so you can connect it to a computer via USB, but you also can connect it to a standard MIDI hub, MIDI device, or MIDI interface using a standard MIDI cable.<br /><br />It has Line-In and Line-Out RCA outputs for stereo audio, and there is a headphone connector and a microphone connector.  It also has connectors for standard expression and sustain pedals (1/4\\" TRS or whatever). And it has guitar-strap mounts on the sides, which is interesting if you want to play it while standing in a way similar to an electric guitar.<br /><br />This mini-MID keyboard runs on power from the USB cable when connected to a computer or USB hub, and it also will run on three \\"AA\\" batteries, and it has a port for a DC power supply, but the batteries and DC power supply are not included, so if you want to use a DC power supply, then you need a 9V 200mA power supply with negative (-) inside and positive (+) outside for the connector (a.k.a., \\"barrel negative center\\"), where the Jim Dunlop ECB03 Dun C/B Adaptor Eliminator is a nice hum-reducing power supply unit with the correct specifications, output, and barrel negative center.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0002E3FBA Jim Dunlop ECB03 Dun C/B Adaptor Eliminator]]<br /><br />However, the mini-MIDI keyboard does not require much power, so if you are connecting it to the computer with a USB cable, it uses the USB power with no problems, although for example on a Mac Pro (Apple) you want to connect it to one of the USB ports on the Mac Pro rather than to a USB port on the Apple Display, since the Mac Pro USB ports have more power.  I have not tried connecting it to one of the USB ports on the Apple Display or keyboard, but generally when a USB device needs power it is better to connect it to a USB port that provides more power.<br /><br />The Behringer user guide is very detailed, and it explains everything in clear and easily understood steps, which is the way I discovered how to configure the keys to be fixed volume and to require only a tiny touch.  The default configuration for the keys is to be velocity sensitive, which maps to needing to press hard to get full volume for a note and was not what I wanted.<br /><br />Another useful thing this mini-MIDI keyboard does when it is connected to a computer via the USB port is that you can connect the standard MIDI Out cable to external MIDI devices and then configure the keyboard for \\"MIDI THRU\\" operation, where in addition to being a MIDI keyboard, it can control other MIDI devices on the same MIDI chain or whatever.<br /><br />For reference, I am not an expert on MIDI, but it is making more sense, and I am working on some MIDI courses from macProVideo and Groove 3.  And as noted part of the reason for selecting this particular mini-MIDI keyboard is that it has all the controls (buttons, rotary knobs, and so forth) for doing pretty much everything that can be done with MIDI in terms of commands, instructions, and so forth. I do not understand everything it is capable of doing, but I know enough about MIDI at present to state that this mini-MIDI keyboard does everything about which I have read, including all the stuff I read but do not really understand.<br /><br />You can browse or download the Behringer user guide at the Behringer website and verify this for yourself, and it does MIDI Machine Control, CC, GS/XG parameters, and a lot of other stuff which at present makes absolutely no sense to me, but it is nice to know that I can experiment with it when it starts to make a bit of sense.<br /><br />Yet another thing you can do with this mini-MIDI keyboard is to use a swivel desktop stand, so that when you need to use it next to the computer you can swivel it into position but otherwise can swivel it out of the way, and I use the following desktop swivel stand for this purpose, which works very nicely, where the key is to use the four rubber \\"dots\\" that come with the unit to keep the mini-MIDI keyboard from moving when it is on the swivel stand, which for reference originally is intended for use with notebook computers but works very nicely for the Behringer mini-MIDI keyboard, as you can see in the photograph I added to the listing, where there are several ways to mount the desktop swivel stand to a table or workbench, noting that I also did a review of the desktop swivel stand, which has more detail on how it works and how to attach it to a table or desktop:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0036LMH3I 332B Notebook/Laptop Extension Stand Desktop Clamp]]<br /><br />Summarizing, this is a very nice, full-featured mini-MIDI keyboard with a complete set of MIDI command and control functionality.s (buttons, rotary knobs, and so forth) for doing pretty much everything that can be done with MIDI in terms of commands, instructions, and so forth.

B004ELSDZK|5.0|I am not much of a game player but this game is interesting and its easy to lose track of time while you go through the levels. I have not gotten too far into the game yet, so the levels are still relatively easy but I know it will get more difficult. I do not have a lot of time to play so I like that I can open it up on the Kindle and start where I left off.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was one of the best books i have ever read. I thought it would be too brutal but it was not at all
B000PMLFRA|5.0|just a collector because he feel me when i kid only i like watch this movie at my home televisyen

B003O86FMW|5.0|amazing and I'm only writing this cuz I can't figure out how to spin this ans I only need one word left. Goodbye
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It kept your interest; of what could happen next.  Throughout the series different parts got you asking if what had just happened really just happened.
B000000XB8|5.0|Sounds great, so good my friends are getting back into vinyl.. Its so clean and full range sound not crimped sound like cd or mp3, also its thick not flimsy.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I very much enjoyed this book.  The characters seemed realistic and fleshed out and their dialog and tone was believeable. *SPOILER*  The ending was so sad.  I realized about halfway through the book that if there was a happy ending that it would seem cheap and contrived, but that did not stop me from bawling at the end.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This game is a good time killer.It does occaisionally crash and the screen flickers sometimes but over all not a bad game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|OMG !!!!  They are right  the book is way Better than the movie I can't tell you every thing but it's very good it gives you details in your head of what's happinin and I accidentally saw the movie before the book so when you do that you no where it is in the book .. more reviews on other books tell me..
B00418NX24|4.0|Ok. I like vinyl and the music.. But only gets 4 stars as i had to return the first one.. It was warped and label was peeling.. That was not amazons fault.. They took it back and got me another one.. So 5 star  to amazon, bit 4 to the record company.
B00A77II0U|3.0|The app froze my Kindle several times. Not as good as Sacre Terra which I absolutely loved. Wish I'd played in reverse order. Still I would purchase this again though it's over priced for the irritation it caused.
B0034G4OYK|3.0|Mavis feels trapped. She wants to go out, but her father, Dracula, is afraid for her to come in contact with humans. He's so concerned for her safety that he lies and tricks to convince her to stay inside Hotel Transylvania. And then, Johnny shows up.<br /><br />I like animation, but I don't often watch the films with monsters. I watch every now and then when I get curious about these types of films being made for children. There is one image I believe would frighten a small child, and song lyrics I guess were supposed to be cute, but I found disgusting. There were also a few fun parts, nice imagery, and I liked the song, Zing. The film teaches a good lesson about making assumptions and there's a message being sent to over-protective parents.<br /><br />Favorite character: Johnny<br />Favorite line: \\"I promised your mommy I would protect you forever.\\"
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I was sitting around one day with my new coins I bought, and I came across this one app! I called my friends and asked if this app was good, the answer was yes from all of them. I was very scared of wasting 3 dollars, after I bought the app,  I played the app for a few hours and I became hooked. This is the best game you can get if you are always needing something to do! 282899999888893 stars! ITS WORTH IT!
1601251831|5.0|This is a good book at good price. Great if just starting or played long ago,  easy to use. I recommend it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I enjoy the games all in the game. It is nice to play all the games it give you the different games Iam glad I got it.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|I waited hungrily for this book.  Pulled in by the first two of the series, I knew that an author of Oliver's ability would not let me down in the finale.  And for the first ninety five percent of the book, I was right.  The plot moved along at a pace that made reading the novel in one sitting an option.  The return of the stalwart Lena, her boyfriend issue, and the rise of the resistance hooked me again as they had in the first two books.  I felt myself swept along to a conclusion to end all conclusions when, at the very end, the book spat out some kind of a philosophical harangue that left me wondering why I bothered to read at all.  This is an extraordinarily gifted writer who should have done better.
B00C49H3WI|5.0|I can't wait til season 2 of this new show! Tatiana Maslany deserves multiple awards for her multiple roles, and Jordan Gavaris is one of my new favorite actors. If you haven't watched it yet, do so now, but prepare to be obsessed and in love - it's shockingly addictive in a soapy way while being extremely well-plotted and well-written; it's deliciously creepy and suspenseful while at the same time sweet and funny. Don't be fooled by its \\"sci-fi\\" genre status - it's a mystery/thriller/drama/comedy all in one -it'll be a sleeper hit for sure.
1601251505|5.0|This is a good book at good price. Great if just starting or played long ago,  easy to use. I recommend it.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|While I recognize that more studies need to be done, this makes so much sense. And more important, it's do-able. You've got nothing to lose if you try the fast diet. Nothing except excessive weight, high blood pressure, the likelihood of developing cancer, high cholesterol readings......
B008K8VDPU|2.0|First time I used it was kind of ok being free, but second time I ran the program  the sound was crazzy because pushing a key used to generate several echoes of the same note
B005IQ39AY|4.0|I like it because it seems like a cross between pinball and pool, but easier. I haven't quite figured out the finer points of the game, but I like it much better than the jewel games--it is more challenging and there is more placement strategy to get past level 6. Sometimes I don't even get by level two, but I like it.
B009CG9JFU|4.0|Greatt movie, i have watched it over and over again..  There is no better remake for this movie. I recommend
B00CL50KDY|3.0|Nothing amazing. Cute story. A unique take on the zombie fab. But not quite as funny or amazing as some people described
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Incredible and creative puzzle game with an ominous air that will keep you glued to your screen tweaking and turning and pressing buttons until you get to the next box. I've honestly never come across another tablet game quite like it.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I didn't know if I would like this film as well as the Lord of the Ring but it was wonderful and I am looking forward to the next two installments. A great addition to our film library.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|This is up there like the lotr,  i like how he added what gandelf was doing.. In the book he just leaves then pops back. But he ties in other Books that are not lotr nicely.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was insane. I never saw anything coming. I highly recommend this book. I can't believe all that happened with Katniss and Peeta
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I absolutely love Downton Abbey and look forward to viewing Season 4 on Amazon!  Thanks for providing a great selection for our viewing pleasure!!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I love this game it is so much fun and I love the mystery in it and also the puzzles are very challenging and it make you use your brain and you wonder what's gonna happen next every time you solve a puzzle.  you never know what's gonna be around the next corner it might be a monster or a giant squid and also you get addicted to the game when you start playing it
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Awesome Blues Album. Not only is Hugh Laurie a great actor but he is an amazing musician and has pulled in some awesome talent for this album
B002VUFKG6|5.0|I think that this is a book that should read by anyone who plans on getting married or simply is terrified of marriage. I personally have been in a committed monogamous relationship for seven years. The both of us have wanted marriage and also have dreaded it. My partner and I discussed all the points of this book and came to the decision that marriage is what we want even if we have to deal with the legalities to make it official. We will always have our privacy.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Thanks to Amazon for keeping up with the latest and most popular shows!  I love Downton Abbey and look forward to viewing the next Season!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|The way this book was written was so easy to understand....I always felt the need to be healed...constantly trying to find an answer to it all...now I live in enjoying all that is..... I eat healthy because I love how it makes me feel.....when we transcend all our fears then we live in our pure state ..<br />.love this book
0743297334|5.0|The format and style of The Sun Also Rises contrasts greatly with many modern works.  Initially, I found the read to be difficult; however, I quickly warmed to the text.  I look forward to reading another of his works.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|I LOVE this movie! Had seen the original DVD, but the Collector's Edition has more special features and the presentation case is very attractive.
B00597A6NU|4.0|This was a really good movie about a bomber crew in WWII.  But, it has nothing to do with the last mission of the Memphis Belle and crew.  A good reminder of what The Greatest Generation went through.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My kindle fire stopped charging. Thanks Amazon for sending me the updated charger to get it back working. I can't sleep at night if I don't read something before I drift off. I had a rough two nights. And thanks for the speedy delivery.
B00CH87HF4|1.0|I love the game I spent some Amazon points on it then one day for no reason the game gets an update and my whole saved files was gone all the effort and spent money gone. For that one star. I will surely call Amazon and demand my points back.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A unique series that should never have been cancelled. Very unique premise and a great cast. Thoroughly enjoy watching it.
B005UDD1R6|3.0|This app plays good videos.Pictures come out clear and if you wish you can make screen wider.I watch videos of various sorts which is the reason I ordered this app.Thanks Amazon.
030758836X|3.0|Too long but had its moments. I found it to be a bit annoying in places but my Bookclub chose it so I had to read it
B00004VVN9|4.0|While the movie has  some very outdated items (the phone modem cradle for one) the thing that disgusted me was the scene of Michael \\"viewing\\" what Gordey was \\"viewing\\".\\" In the DVD I bought on Amazon the woman on the tape was some young chick (who had revealed her white cotton bra and panties earlier) and was working in virtual black & white darkness to get the guy off. Big Deal! In the original movie release the woman on the tape was a full-blooded prostitute with breasts going everywhere as she worked to get the guy off. Go back and watch the guy's description of the tape to Gordey. He is n NOT talking about some young chick in a white cotton bra and panties! Then again, maybe it was the version of the DVD I bought. It was a DVD from \\"One of our other sellers\\" and it turned out to be originally from a rental place. If someone can guarantee me that the Amazon offered version IS the REAL original movie release, I would buy it.<br /><br />BUT this is a review. While the movie is dated in some areas, it is still a GREAT flick! Sci-Fi people should love it for it's premises. Conspiracy theorists should love it! Anti-big government people should love it! Anti-big businesses-who-sell-out people should love it! And the house the Brace's live in, I'd give my left nut to own such a house (it's useless anyway since I've had a vasectomy so that would be no real loss. Ha! Ha!). And yeah, it has it's sappy moments but for the romantic person that is okay.<br /><br />Other than the substituted scene it is a great movie in my opinion.
B004BEMC6G|2.0|AMAZON,<br /><br />Please check your audio quality of movies before selling them to your customers.<br /><br />I could have gotten the same movie on your site for $4.32 but the sound was also terrible.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like this game once I knew how to play.do so goo goo do cu bY fT ssh ssh do to flak to to
B008MM9630|3.0|Cute idea, but really frustrating when you can't complete quests because they only offer what you need to complete them seasonally.
B001NXDIMK|5.0|What more can you want from a TV series..its well written, the acting is Top Notch, the production values are A1, well directed... and unlike all the other shows that are currently airing right now its character driven..al and allits just spell blindily brilliant!! Glenn Close in my opinion gives one of the best perfomances this season than all the seasons (look out for the kitchen scene with her husband)...Everyone keeps says that Season 1 was better however, I want to agree but I just cant because Season 2 was the season that got me hooked. Rose Byrne is sooooo underrated..William Hurt at first I didnt understand his character and what really was his purpose and stance but I get it now. Season 2 just has it..television at its best
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|It is one fun game it is free and the story is good it is easy to download it is fun<br />Free download it
B008OOYALE|4.0|It takes a bit of time to adjust to the game with all of the constant breeding and waiting, but I still think it's an awesome game!
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|The movie is action packed, has funny moments and is believable.  I have read a couple of the books and know what the character is suppose to look like but the movie kept me entertained enough where I did not care.  I actually enjoyed the movie more than the books.
1582406723|5.0|Tony Moores art is excellent in this book. You must understand he is replaced on issues 7 moving forward. Adlard does a good job but Moores art is a homerun combined with Kirkmans gut wrenching story. This is a must have. Save your money though and grab the compendium or the hard covers. If you like this book you' ll enjoy them all.
B004UID2LC|5.0|i get to download all my favorite shows and music to my kindle fire!! i useitall the time. it downloads to your galery and itdoesnt evn take wi-fi to whatch or listen to it!! IT WORKS GREAT!!!!
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Watched this movie on the Big-Screen.  Love the books and the movies.  I purchased this for the great offer that Amazon made me.  Having Blu-Ray, DVD, and Digital Copy, I could not get that anywhere for what I paid with Amazon.  Fast shipping, and excellent value.  Looking forward to movies 2 and 3.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book was a quick read and I loved the characters and the end. I was not sure because there were not that am
B002BY77CW|4.0|I love this book I think I've read it like 3 times since I bought it its like you cant put the book down cause every page ther is something new or exciting happening I 100'/. Recommend this book
B0058VW36U|4.0|This game is fun and can be very challenging to the point of sometimes being agitating.  If you like the game Where's My Water, you'll find this excellently entertaining.
B000AMJC2K|4.0|This arm was a little smaller than what I was expecting however it looks really nice. It came with all parts needed and the assembly directions were clear and concise (mostly pictures).  While I am a little disappointed with the design on the swivel-hinge that WOULD allow you to tilt the monitor up or down: the &#34;Up&#34; vs &#34;Down&#34; is relative only to the way the arm is positioned. The way I need it sometimes the hinge is diagonal. HOWEVER, since the arm also allows the monitor to be rotated between Landscape or Portrait (or anything in between) I am still able to position the monitor the way I want it.  This LCD arm clamps securely to the lip of my desk, which is slightly less than 1&#34; thick and is VERY stable. The entire arm is VERY stable! While I am annoyed with that hinge thing, the arm does meet all my needs.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Was so happy to be able to order it online. I have been waiting for this DVD ever since I read the book. Really enjoyed the movie and would recommend it
B006M4F67A|5.0|great game, easy to use, lots of different layouts that are challenging. I would recommend this game to anyone of any age.
B00BAWEGPW|5.0|Best easy read book about fictional creatures it was every interesting tales about brownies. I would reexamine it for young readers
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Wonderful war story with action, history and amazing compassion. A must read for all generations. Great photos and detail in the last section.
B008XG1X18|5.0|talk about a new addiction  ive found mine  awesome ideas awesome site awesome time spent looking around i absolutely recommend this to anyone
B009UNGYHG|4.0|I am very pleased with the charging case. It is compact enough to fit in my pockets or any purse and I love that. It is also a great way to keep the earpiece charged,especially if I forget to put the earpiece on the charger.
B00AYB1TP0|4.0|My 3 year old loves this game!!! She is learning her A B C's thanks to this app!!!! I recommend this to all parents!!
B003Y5H5BA|4.0|This movie has a bunch of funny lines that are fun to quote.  Not a Jonah Hill fan but he did good in this one.  Funniest scene is when they take the drugs at school.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|just like at the carnival fun and relaxing enjoyful time killer great to compete with the grand kids love it
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Great game! Quell games are by far my favorite games for kindle. This latest addition was well worth the wait. Fun new features add to the challenge of the familiar game.
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|A very underrated series that is the &#34;prequel&#34; to the rest of the Star Trek shows and movies.  Season 3 has a running, cohesive theme through the whole season, and continues the solid cast performance and strong plot lines of season 2. There's even more action, and we start to see a few more esoteric episodes such as one that takes place in Detroit of 2004 (the year the episode was filmed).<br /><br />Enterprise is approachable for non-trekkies, but Trekkies will love it.  Strong acting, interesting plots, nice graphics (for the time), and a lot of precedent-setting stuff happening before the Federation existed.  Unlike Voyager (the prior series), there's a lot less &#34;how could they be that stupid??&#34; moments.  All those times you watched Voyager and were annoyed by all the stuff they didn't do-- when they didn't fight back, when they talked slowly instead of firing, when they were defeated by virtually everything they encountered and were usually saved by accident or by outside forces rather than their own efforts and skills?  This show doesn't do that.  You think &#34;Captain Archer should punch that guy in the face!&#34; and lo and behold, Captain Archer does punch that guy in the face!  The lack of bumbling makes this series feel much more real, and much more watchable.<br /><br />I briefly watched &#34;Enterprise&#34; when it first aired, but broadcast was a terrible way to watch shows like this.  Streaming in HD without commercials makes for a far superior experience.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|This show may take a few episodes to get hooked, but it will happen.  It is a combination of sexy females for the men.  A good looking male lead for the ladies.  Plus non stop laughs.  Troy and Abed are the best part of the show.  Love the paintball episodes.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Very good game. Love the variety at the end. The only thing I would like to see different is I'd like a little more space between the two different areas at the top.
B003YUWLQE|4.0|I would give them a five if I was certain they will hold up. Time will tell. Easy to slip on and off.
B000FC146C|3.0|When I read a book, it's relaxing to get caught up in the story and escape into another time and place. However, this Kindle edition is the worst copy I've read. I was constantly stammering over misplaced commas and rambling sentences, and aggravatingly brought back to reality.
B004EPZ08E|4.0|All three of these guys are good for a laugh.  Charlie Day needs to be in more movies.  Jennifer Anniston gets hotter the older she is and likes wearing less and less clothes.
B000YN369A|5.0|Ran into this album through Garden State. Ok movie, wonderful music! A nice mix of things that doesn't sound like anything else on the radio.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Very hard to engage beginning of book but we'll worth the wait.  Don't think you will be disappointed.  Give it a try.
B008JFUMHE|3.0|NOW YOU SEE ME thinks that it's a really smart, twisty movie.  I suspect it secretly hopes to be this year's INCEPTION or even THE PRESTIGE (both smart, twisty movies from Christopher Nolan of THE DARK KNIGHT fame).  Heck, it even has Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman from the BATMAN movies.  But it is NOT all that smart.  It does have a lot of twists, yes, but as the movie goes on, they become less and less convincing.<br /><br />Early in the film, we meet 4 magicians who are not exactly the most successful prestidigitators out there (Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson and Dave Franco).  But they are called together to a mysterious apartment in NYC and given a mysterious mission.  A year later, with the support of mogul Michael Caine, they are playing a huge crowd at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, where they transport an audience member to the inside of his vault in Paris.  They bring him back, along with the 3 million euros that were in the vault, and they shower the money upon the audience.  Thus, the police are now very interested in this group (called The Four Horsemen), but are unable to keep them because unless the FBI is willing to admit they believe in magic, they have no way of showing HOW the crime could have been committed.<br /><br />The investigation is led by agent Mark Ruffalo (at his most rumpled) who is perplexed by these magicians and goaded by their taunting.  He is soon aided by an Interpol agent (Melanie Laurent from INGLORIOUS BASTERDS), and even assisted to some degree by professional magic debunker Morgan Freeman.  Freeman mostly serves the purpose of telling Ruffalo (and thus the audience) how the tricks are done.  These reveals range from amusing and moderately clever to eventually ridiculously elaborate, dangerous and expensive.  I won't give any more details, but let's just say that The Four Horsemen are apparently brilliant cat-burglars, drivers, engineers and even MMA fighters.<br /><br />The film, thus, grows from being quite interesting and engaging into something that really stretches credibility.  At first, we're willing to be drawn along for the ride...but after a while, the antics grow too big (and yet too predictable at the same time).  You're meant to get really involved in wondering who the puppet-master behind all this might be (and you're given a few red herrings along the way)...but I was not terribly invested.<br /><br />The performers are varyingly successful.  Freeman & Caine give us the same quality (but uninspired) work they so often do when allowed to take a paycheck role.  (Please don't get me wrong...Caine is capable even now of the most delicate and gripping performances [HARRY BROWN springs to mind], but he is coasting here).  Eisenberg is at his most annoying here, but it fits his character.  Harrelson is always fun and brings enjoyable energy, easily stealing his scenes.  Fisher is wasted, and Dave Franco (James' brother) mostly fades into the background.  But the magicians become less and less central, and Ruffalo and Laurent become more important.  I like both of these actors, but here their chemistry is forced and the script doesn't do them any favors.<br /><br />I had an okay time at NOW YOU SEE ME because I naturally like trying to outguess tricky movies.  And the basic concept of the film is actually pretty solid.  But the execution is lacking.  The movie wants to feel like a big summer blockbuster...but it needs a properly scaled down feel and a bit more at stake.  The camera work consists mostly of swirly, 360 degree sweeps.  The characters go from engaging to cardboard.  And the plot (and this type of movie is first and foremost about the plot) is ultimately unsatisfying and perhaps quite full of holes.  But I didn't care enough to try to figure out those holes.  And that is not a good sign.  2.5 stars.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I don not really care for zombies.  However, the story line and characters have me hooked.  Each week I look forward to the next episode and hope my favorite character make it out alive.

B005CRQ2DK|5.0|Somesmartkid11<br />Cabin Fever is a funny book filled with unusual storys about Greg's home and school life. This unusually unlucky boy has gotten into much trouble as a middle school kid but one time it was not even him! Sort of...
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I love RPGs, and like \\"match 3\\" games a lot.  Putting both concepts together has created a really good twist on both.<br /><br />It took a few tries to figure out some of the features, but that's a familiar part of RPGs anyway.<br />The scrolling rows and columns were different, but once figured out, were pretty intuitive, and allowed matching a lot more combinations than just the typical \\"swipe 3 contiguous tiles\\" games, something you really need when you're in combat against something other than a timer.<br /><br />The whole idea of a \\"Role Playing Game\\" is pretty well translated into this different combat method also.  Instead of just hitting an \\"Attack\\" button when you encounter a monster, you actually have to do something with your brain (what a concept), and find a good match to give you the best outcome.  Sometimes the tiles fall in your favor, sometimes they don't.  Not a whole lot different than playing against the typical RPG's random number generator.<br /><br />There are goals provided other than just killing monsters for points such as improving your weapons and armor, or unlocking better upgrades through \\"level ups\\" of skills by using \\"experience points\\" (and of course having to decide which to use first for the best effect, just like any good RPG), and by repairing the \\"rooms\\" where the upgrades can be obtained.  Sometimes that will require going for resources (wood and stone) instead of just bashing monsters, and sometimes you need to go for as much gold as you can to buy the next upgrade.  All decisions needed in an RPG.<br /><br />The fact that you're controlling the game through a \\"match3\\" input pad keeps it interesting while all this other stuff is happening.<br /><br />Maybe if you're just a fan of \\"Match 3\\" games all this other stuff won't appeal, and if you're a die-hard dungeon crawler used to hitting \\"A\\" for attack possibly the new input method will be too much to handle, but for me it was a great combination.<br /><br />The only downside:The game poops out about halfway through.<br />I'm at something above 5 million points, and have upgraded everything to its max, with no further possibility of improving my weapons or armor, and now I'm faced with just playing \\"Match 3\\" for another 5,000,000 points to \\"win\\".<br /><br />I'd love to see the game developed further to open up more upgrade possibilities for the \\"second half\\".<br /><br />It would also be great if there were more possibilities to \\"earn\\" better and more frequent time extensions because each foray into the dungeon is pretty short the way it is now.<br /><br />Still, one of the better games I've played in a long time..!
B00018D3RI|5.0|I would recommend Starsky and Hutch to anyone.  It is a well written show and they are great together.  I just love them.  I watch Starsky and Hutch all the time.

B003VANOFY|1.0|The Good:<br /><br />This thing sounds and feels phenomenal. I'm no audiophile so take that with a grain of salt, but I have nothing but good things to say about that aspect of this headset. I've been using it for video games (the surround sound is great) as well as voip. Also Logitech has outstanding customer support and honestly, I'm a huge fan of them in general.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />You may have charging problems - they did not do a good job designing that part of the system. I had to RMA mine after almost a year and honestly, I don't expect the replacement to last more than a year itself.<br /><br />The part of the headset that you plug the charging cable into isn't very sturdy. If you look through the logitech support forums, you'll see lots of people with broken headsets. This thread (scroll down a bit) has some of the gory details:<br /><br />[...]

B005XZHQKY|2.0|Bought this for the 3D effect. This ain't no IMAX movie making. The 3D sucks.<br /><br />Jacques, his dad would turn over in Davy Jones' Locker with this not in 3D release.<br /><br />Don't buy this if you are into 3D. IMAX aquarium films are vastly superior to this dud.<br /><br />Can not imagine anyone writing anything good about this unless they are part of the production crew. This is bad 3D movie making. Am I disappointed with this dullard. Jeez.<br /><br />Have the most recent 3D TV.It is passive 3D. My laptop is the most advanced 3D laptop on this planet and has shutter glasses 3D (no passive laptop exists for the moment). The 3D sucks in this DVD trilogy. Checked both the TV and the laptop for 3D rendering. Where's the 3D? Where is the beef?<br /><br />TV is LG and the monstrous laptop w/16 Gbs of RAM, 3D, 17.3\\" 3 Gbs of VR is an Asus G74sx.

B006VFLIYK|5.0|Riveting, action packed and entertaining.<br /><br />A few choice words and a short, fairly non-discript love scene do not significantly take away from the story.<br /><br />There were quite a few surprises, though the main secret seemed fairly obvious.

0316224588|5.0|After the last Rebus novel I feared we were actually going to lose him, but thank goodness his career has been extended!  Now I suppose I'll anxiously await then savor each new tale as it comes along.  Rankin's writing style is so addictive, but cleverly he doesn't leave you feeling as if you'd been suckered into reading the next chapter, then the next, then the next only to be thrown some twisting turn of a solution.  The endings are satisfying then leave you hungry for more, and not just about the intrigue of criminal investigation work, but also for more about the characters themselves.  Rebus and company have become friends you really care about.  They are so carefully and realistically constructed.  I also like the way he renews our acquaintances with previously introduced characters and locations just at the right moment in the narrative.  Right about the time I think I'm going to have to flip back to see who or where that was again, I turn the page and there is that gentle reminder to jog my memory.  And he does it without interrupting the flow of the story.  Live on, Rebus and Rankin!

0399159347|5.0|Book #48 Read in 2013<br />The Husband's Secret by Liane Moriarty<br /><br />This book tells the story of three women:  Rachel, Cecilia and Tess, and how they are connected in ways that are unknown even to them.  Rachel's daughter was murdered as a teenager.  Cecilia is feeling unsatisfied with her normally perfect life as wife and mother.  Tess's husband has fallen in love with her cousin, so she packs up her young son and goes back home to her mother's.  All three women are dealing with tons of issues, to varying degrees of success.  These women are interesting and complex.  There is a decent mystery plot to this book to keep readers engaged.  At times this book is a tad predictable but that did not take away enjoyment from reading it.<br /><br />I liked Moriarty's book What Alice Forgot so I chose this one from Amazon Vine to review.  I was not disappointed.  I enjoy her writing style; it is easy and enjoyable to read without being fluff.  Moriarty creates interesting characters that will keep readers hooked in her books.  I recommend this book.<br /><br />http://melissasbookpicks.blogspot.com
B0027MJU00|4.0|Another great thriller by Gillian Flynn. I really enjoyed this book. I found this one to be a little more predictable than her other two, but there was still a twist in the plot I hadn't pieced together but the very end. I can't wait to read more from this author.

I use this as part of my thesis to demonstrate that this book along with German rationalism brought the downfall of society today because of throwing out the Judah-Christian God.

B001QE9WEO|4.0|While I do agree with everyone else on here that the soundtrack was changed, I did not let that interfere with the fact that I like this movie! It is funny and creepy at the same time. Me and my hubby enjoyed it!
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I would like this game a lot better if you weren't forced to buy pearls in order to complete some of the goals.  As it is not worth it to me.  I will be deleting it from my Kindle.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This game is very fun to play on your spare time. There's so many good things about it from graphics to traveling in a hot air balloon. And I like how you can be able to have backgrounds to enjoy playing the game. In my honest opinion I think this a big step up from Brave.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is out standing.  Everyone needs to get this, even you who is reading this. So stop reading and get it.

B001U9BRNE|5.0|You'll really like the music as well as the stars who accompany David Foster on this blu-ray dvd.  The depth of David Foster's talent (songwriter, composer, etc.) will come to the forefront in this &#34;tribute&#34; to his music................sit back and enjoy!
B00B6QXN56|4.0|An acoustic version of mostly previously recorded sound but still worth the new take. The musician, as always, is excellent.

B00003CXCQ|5.0|What can you say, it's Disney.  I can't imagine what audiences thought when this first hit the screen.  Obviously, a labor of love.  Both my grandson and grandaughter watch this over and over.  So do I.
B0075MFS9Y|4.0|I was not familiar with this group but read some reviews so purchased it.  Hits me as sort of somewhere between &#34;Fun&#34; and &#34;Mumford and Sons&#34; but Mumford's music is getting repetitious to me so this was a nice and original change.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I felt like sometimes, the story jumped ahead too quickly. But, I loved the plot. The same points that we have always known of these stories, but with perfect twists on common fables!!
B0013ND30M|5.0|received the DVD set as promised in New condition.  My granddaughter, almost 3 years old, took a bit of time to get past the first part, but now watches it every time she comes over.  Thank goodness for scene selection.  And for parents who have to watch the movie over and over, turn on the Princess Fun facts.  The popups are not just about princess facts, but historical ones including architecture and disney facts about the film and how it was made.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Awesome game but there's 2 problems. #1 Kindle version needs to be updated. #2 They need to get Kindle version of Draw Something 2. Other than that, BEST GAME EVER!!!
B00C2VIA52|4.0|The graphics and smooth gameplay are some of the strongest parts of this game. It remains to be seen how the cards gain in complexity. The strategy was a little light for my taste and I tend not to like card games where board placement plays too much of a role. If I wanted that I'd play a miniatures game.
B0001I561E|4.0|We received the DVD set as promised on the delivery date.  But unfortunately, disc 1 had a manufacturer problem with two of the scenes, including the last scene.  Banner and Flappy, the sellers for Amazon, refunded the cost of the purchase and threw in the shiiping costs for the return.  I can't say enough about this rare customer service.  I will certainly purchase from them again, with a painless return policy like this, it is no risk in purchasing from them.  As for the film, my grandaughters favorite, so we will be looking for another reasonably priced copy again.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|I got these for my boyfriend's music recording. He loves them and gets so much more sound than his last set of headphones. You can wear them for hours without any discomfort or tightness(and I have a huge head WITH dreadlocks attached, so doubly huge). The only downside is that just a couple weeks after I bought them one of the ear muff things ripped. Nothing wrong with the sound quality, just exposed foam. Everything about these is great EXCEPT for the cushions, which are probably just cheaply made.<br /><br />Love these, recommend them to anyone wanting to get into music recording on the cheap.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I loved DragonVale because its Tycoon and has a money system. I also loved it because its a social game.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|So very sadly, the Amazons don't seem to realize that the reviews of any particular edition of a movie title - be that regular DVD, Blu-ray or 3D Blu-ray - should be kept within the confines OF THAT EDITION!<br />Who likes to dig through sometimes hundreds of reviews just to find one relevant to your edition of choice? Don't hold you breath for this or any other of the Amazons \\"ways\\" to EVER change!<br />  As for this 3D - absolutely the first real competition for \\"Tangled\\" not only for visual and audio splendor but the story is really charming.<br />  Here it is simply put:<br />  3D and picture aesthetics - AWESOME!<br />  Story and sound - you may never stop watching,<br />  Overall - this is a story about all things bright and beautiful and how - however or whenever<br />  threatened, they triumph and when that beautiful snowflake comes gently out of the<br />  picture and lands on your nose or finger ... you'll be so enthralled and delighted.<br />  The colors and graphics are beyond breathtaking,

I am having each of their teachers sign it at the end of each school year and hopefully I will be around to give this to them at their graduations from high school.  Already the teachers have enjoyed the idea and have written paragraphs for them to recall their special years of school. A great book for youngsters and oldsters retiring, too!

B000M5AKP8|5.0|Ever since I was a kid, I heard Elvis Presley songs on the radio, but never had any of his CD's. I recently developed a new appreciation for Elvis after watching and listening to the music video of the JXL remix of \\"A Little Less Conversation.\\" I love that song! When I discovered that the song was included on this CD, I was delighted. Well, this has all of my favorite Elvis songs in one compilation. I highly recommend it.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Incredibly cool, energetic, creative and inspiring - you can't help but love this album! Dub-step around the edges with soaring violin melody lines and rhythms that make you want to jump off the couch; Lindsey is a true, original artist unlike any other!
B005S9EKCW|2.0|As a visual representation of the famous stage musical Les Miserables, this film is beautifully photographed and finely acted.  But as a musical, this film is really disappointing.  The filmmakers of this Les Mis made the unfortunate casting choice of actors who have to sing (even when it is clearly not their best talent) rather than singers who can act.  In my opinion, this was a strange choice for a film musical.<br /><br />I'm in company with the editorial minority (see Emma Gosnell's 1/20/13 review, \\"Why I walked out of Les Miserables,\\" in the UK newspaper, The Telegraph) who have panned the new Les Mis because the singing is occasionally painful to hear and in too many cases just downright disappointing.  Gosnell is perfectly correct in saying that the music for this musical is operatic in style and scope and requires voices with real clout.  Sadly, this Les Mis is more a movie and less a musical, attempting a greater climate of cinematic realism at the expense of musicality.<br /><br />Yes, there are visual passages of true pathos and horror in this film which do justice to Hugo's heartrending narrative about the disenfranchised \\"children of the revolution\\" (such as Fantine's ghastly descent into prostitution where she not only sells her hair to survive and support her child, but her teeth as well).  But the greatest expressiveness of Les Mis the musical is it's music which suffers by the musical demands placed on these first rate actors who are most of them, sadly, just not singers.<br /><br />Case in point.  Although I am a die hard fan of Russell Crowe and have all his performances on disc, it is truly painful to watch his powerful acting (a menacing, implacable but finally vulnerable Javert) weakened by his hoarse whispery singing voice.  His performance doesn't come off as \\"raw and real\\" as he has stated in response to criticism, it comes off as one of the best actors of his generation stepping too far out of his areas of competence by attempting to sing.The live recording of the actors songs may have been \\"brave\\" but ill-chosen for the vehicle they were attempting to realize.  This Les Mis simply doesn't meet the first goal in effectively representing a musical whether on stage or in film:  singing the music well!<br /><br />Since I viewed it at home, I did not \\"walk out\\" on the film (as Ms. Gosnell and other reviewers did).  But I won't be watching it again and again as I still do the 1995 Albert Hall full costume concert version of Les Miserables which wrings every ounce of feeling and passion from Hugo's novel with it's brilliant singing of Claude-Michel Schonberg and Alain Boublil's magnificent score and lyrics.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I absolutely love this game! I can't put it down until I master all the levels. My 5 year old and her friends love playing it also!  It's nice to have a game you can play alone or with your kids.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This is such a well-written book. The storyline is quite common, but Nicholas Sparks does a great job making it very interesting.  He keeps you on the edge of your seat at times. I highly recommend this book.
B000FCKPHG|5.0|Make it happen!<br /><br />There are 8 months until the Winter Olympics that will begin Feb. 7th, 2014. Now is a good time to coach your children about the meaning of \\"success\\", \\"champion\\" and the \\"agony of defeat.\\"  Throughout the games we'll hear inspirational stories about athletes that work hard, meet challenges head on, and learn from past mistakes.  \\"Mindset\\"appears to be a classic within teaching and psychology circles. This easy-to-read book, will guide you in coaching your children to have a growth mindset, rather than a fixed mindset, that will help them achieve success, jump over hurdles, and think like a champion.<br /><br />In order to benefit from \\"Mindset\\", you're going to first have to take a cold, hard look at your parenting skills. Have you ever said or thought,  \\"My child is a natural athlete, or artist, or genious\\"? Shockingly,  Dweck's research shows that such statements can provoke a fixed mindset, harming motivation and performance because of the implication that failure means you're not talented or you're dumb. She notes \\"...one thing leads to another - how a belief that your qualities are carved in stone leads to a host of thoughts and actions and how a belief that you can cultivate your qualities leads to a host of different thoughts and actions, taking you down an entirely different road.\\" Dweck doesn't stop with just one or two convicting examples. She assails you with an onslaught of examples, one after another, to prove her point.<br /><br />Her illustrations cover everything from sports, to school, to business. She builds a strong case that certain \\"natural\\" athletes, such as John McEnroe, demonstrated a fixed mindset that prevented them from facing failure with grace and fortitude. McEnroe was notorious for tantrums on the court when he was near defeat. And, he gushed excuses for every setback-hardly what anyone would call a \\"good sport\\". A fixed mindset also explains why the obsession in hiring \\"talent\\", by execs such as Lay and Skilling, of ethically-challenged Enron, resulted in the downfall of an entire conglomerate. At critical decision points they \\"blamed others, covered mistakes, and pumped up stock prices...\\". Whereas athletes such as  Michal Jordan and Pete Sampras and business leaders such as Jack Welch, accomplished GE CEO, all had growth mindsets, shown by the way they overcame difficulties, worked hard, and championed to great success. Their egos were always in check, which kept them in touch with reality and their humanity.  Time and again, Dweck demonstrates that skills and achievement come from commitment and effort, not from natural smarts or physical attributes.<br /><br />Over and over, Dweck emphasizes the growth mindset that is notable in champions such as Wilma Rudolph, First American woman Runner to win three gold medals at a single Olympics. According to Wilma, \\"My mom taught me very early to believe I could achieve any accomplishment I wanted to. The first was to walk without braces.\\" This growth mindset belief, instilled by her mother, cultivated Wilma's ability to walk. Her step-by-step determination and discipline, catapulted Wilma, at age 12, to defeat paralysis in her leg, shed the brace, become a champion and work her way towards becoming an Olympian.<br /><br />But what can you do if you're a fixed-mindset-pushing-for-over-a-decade parent?<br /><br />Dweck explains that everyone can teach and encourage a growth mindset. In fact, with training, Dweck says that success can be achieved in all facets of life, including education, sports, relationships, and careers. Dweck gives a number of practical exercises to help anyone train others in her methodology and work through to growth-minded solutions. From these models, instead of saying \\"you're a genious\\",  you'll learn to say \\"see what you can achieve when you work hard\\".<br /><br />Dweck makes it clear that her paradigm does not include preferences and that change is not easy. She says that, in relationships, individuals \\"have to actually want to change, commit to change and take action to change.\\"  She concedes that maintaining a growth mindset \\"takes plenty of time, effort, and mutual support.\\"<br /><br />Before the Olympics begin, make-up your mind to read \\"Mindset\\", and start training your children to grow their minds and go for the gold... Make it happen!

B00D2K40WY|1.0|The tools are not sensitive enough and my child was extremely frustrated trying to use the app. It is a cute idea but it could be better executed. I'm deleting it as soon as I complete this review.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|I have just discovered Eureka, and I'm loving it.  I am not quite through season 1, but I watch episodes when I can on my Kindle Fire HD.  This is definitely sci-fi, but in a unique setting.  It's quirky, and sees things from a different view point.  In other words, anything goes!  But it's not heavy-duty sci-fi, slogging through a plot.  It's an everyday 'sheriff' trying to do his job, (where at least half the town are geniuses), while dealing with his rebel daughter, stranger than life cases, and a futuristic house that doesn't always see things his way.
B008J34466|5.0|The entire cd is great!!!!! This is a cd you can put on and listen all the way through. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of P!nks music.
B003568FR6|5.0|After reading a lot about this program, I bit the bullet and gave it a shot. I am NOT a person who typically sticks with exercise, but I found this super motivating for some reason. I like the circuit format--I know what's coming next and I like that you don't do any one exercise for more than a couple of minutes, and I like that it's only 25 minutes. I also like that I got results FAST. I am in better shape now than I probably have been in 15 years. I haven't lost much weight, but I have whittled my thighs and bottom (my biggest problem area) and I have a nice little 6-pack in the works. I am really proud of how fit I have become. I recommend this program to all my friends and family--It's hard, but it's worth it.

B0002V7OI8|5.0|With so many of the prior reviews doing such a good job reviewing this movie, I'd only like to add that this day, this particular crisis, will in fact present itself; it's only a matter of time.  While earlier epochs saw the bulk of interplanetary collisions, and today's inner solar system is swept largely clean of large impactors, there's most certainly still one out there with our name on it.<br /><br />As an avid amateur astronomer, I was pleased at the role amateur astronomers played in both Deep Impact and Armageddon. And if you think about it, until very recently, there was no systematic survey of Earth-crossing interlopers, and most comets were the discoveries of amateurs. Subsequent to Gene Shoemaker's ground-breaking work (pun intended), and these two major motion pictures, Deep Impact and Armageddon, many people are aware, and government has taken notice, and has allocated \\"some\\" funds to study this.<br /><br />What depresses me about this movie is that I have zero confidence that our leaders in Washington today, would have the competence, the honesty, or the grace depicted in Deep Impact.  Further, nothing like the technology in Deep Impact, or Armageddon for that matter, is at our disposal today.  And this apparently bothers almost nobody, exactly why?  Our long-term, assured survival, may very well depend on our having a solid presence in space.  The United States used to lead the world in space science.  Today, we hitch rides to and from a space station we sunk a fortune into.  Things have changed.<br /><br />Deep Impact and Armageddon, their unreal political and technological portrayals aside, are important films in that they mark in space and time, our awareness of this extreme but real possibility, versus the short-sighted, instant-gratification mindset that so pervades society today.  An event unlikely in fifty years, may be inevitable five hundred, but does anybody really care?<br /><br />This film is very nicely done, with great performances all around.  As to the awkwardness of some of the characters, we have a novice reporter that has managed to maneuver herself into a primetime anchor slot, reporting on the biggest story in history--and possibly the last.  And we have two children, too young to be married, choosing that option as a practical solution to a nightmare situation.  You know, I would expect \\"awkward\\".  I can hardly imagine...<br /><br />I love this movie!  And since my VHS copy just died, I just ordered the DVD!  This is an annual watch for my family!<br /><br />--RBaround.

B009XIXVU6|3.0|I found the book frustrating to read because of the way it is written, a series of linked stories to linked characters.  It was easy to lose focus and it impacted on my enjoyment of the book.

B000PMLFRA|5.0|I have loved these movies since I was a kid and have wanted to own them since I lost my set years ago but I did not want to spend the big bucks on a blue ray set until I saw this set on sell.  It does not have all kinds of bells and whistles that some people may want in a box set but it is exactly what I wanted at a great price.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Because it was a good dictionary<br /><br />I liked every part of the dictionary<br /><br />I would recommend this book to my God sister

B0000026NC|5.0|There is always gonna be people saying that this is not a Pink Floyd album, because Roger is not in it, but I have to disagree. Don't get me wrong, I love Roger Waters, I think he is a genius and I am glad that these guys were together once, because they made music like no one had ever done before. BUT, this album is pure magic, not only for the live versions of songs from Momentary Lapse of Reason, but for the rendition of old songs from DSOTM and The Wall. That's mainly because David Gilmour is another genius and his guitar playing is simply out of this world. Some other review on amazon states that this is better than PULSE, and I have to agree at a certain degree. Of course this is only my opinion, but I've been listening to Pink Floyd in a daily basis for 25 years and I rarely feel the need to listen to something else, so I am giving myself some kind of credibility here. This album contains the best versions of Comfortably Numb, On the Turning Away, One of These Days and my all-time favorite, Sorrow. Plus different, live versions of many other great songs. I will buy any new live album from PF even if contains the same songs, because I love the different arrangements, guitar solos and guitar tones. Anyway, this is a must have.
B009Y6OIWC|4.0|This apt is great! Easy to use and helps me to remember many dates that I would otherwise forget. It even notifies me of these events.

1401394191|5.0|I bought this some time ago; but, recently took it on a road trip.  Both my husband and I enjoyed it very much.  It is a very sweet, entertaining story--I might even listen to it again.  I sent it to my husband's brother for his birthday.  I could just see him playing the role of this rabbi--very colorful in word, action and inflection.
B0096YJDNQ|5.0|If you are an astronomy buff like I am, own a telescope and just love looking up at the constellations, this app is for you.  It is easy to use and has every location (known) in the universe.  Try this and think of all the possible life there is, &#34;out there&#34;!<br /><br />I highly recommend this app.  This app works great if you can hook up your telescope to your Kindle Fire HD, just access the app and it can actually take your computer right to the constellation, star, planet or just &#34;somewhere out there&#34; (William Shatner).<br /><br />If you cannot use your Kindle Fire HD with your telescope the app is still extremely helpful.  Just life your Kindle Fire HD up to the sky and the app shows the night sky where you stand.  I highly recommend this app to amateurs as it is a great beginning to an awesome universe.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon.com again for offering this app.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|well, i am one among many to say this is a great book. just finished it. in paperback, a \\"real\\" book, not my usual kindle book. i didn't want to spend the $8. to buy the kindle book, and wasn't sure i'd like it (not an animal person, much as i love them, i am highly allergic). but....<br /><br />......what are the odds? i found this book in a thrift store, for 50 cents. my price range. so....i read an actual book. it wasn't too heavy for my weak hands, and i stayed up quite late reading it. it's a great book, as over 3,000 people have already said. i am glad i read it. so glad. it's not just a great book, it's a very great book, i'd say: it's a classic.<br /><br />when i was a child, i read and re-read \\"black beauty\\"; it remains one of my lovely memories of childhood. the horse in the story was intelligent, and loved his family. he suffered greatly in victorian england, owing to the way animals were treated then. but black beauty always found noble, kind, decent people who save him and allow him to have the life he deserved to have, a good life, the life we all, animal and human, deserve.<br /><br />\\"the art of racing in the rain\\" is somewhat the same, in a way, as \\"black beauty\\". no specifics, there are enough reviews for that. but it's a rare book that transcends genre, and is so great that it can apply to many different readers. \\"the art of...\\" does that, and more. not only is it a touching book, but it is written so well that i kept wondering, \\"who is this author?\\" ......who is this author who writes in such a way that i feel i am reading a classic assigned for a college lit class or a high school lit class? it's that good.<br /><br />some of the writing is transcendent: it's philosophy, as spoken by a dog. it doesn't matter which character is saying it, this is a classic book of literature, that all loving, sincere, hopeful people should read. in today's bitter and frightening world, this book is a lovely beacon of hope, of beautiful thoughts, of words of wisdom you should hear. it's ok if it comes from a dog- the words are really wise.<br /><br />highest recommendation.
075669812X|5.0|i bought this for a gift for a 5 year old that is starting to love nanjago legos. this is encyclopedia is great in that he can grow with it over the few years while engaging him into reading (which is something that boys his age do not find as interesting as girls).<br /><br />the bonus: a little ninjago lego character included in the recess of the front cover. a toy that he can actually use!<br /><br />the character encyclopedia is in depth, detailing characters and their accessories.<br /><br />hopefully, the little guy will be a fountain of knowledge to his schoolmates as a result of having this book.
B0015DWLD0|4.0|This is a book that generated sharply divided opinions in our recent all female book club discussion, which I think is a good thing.  (I hate a dull dissuasion.)  Most readers did not like it...felt the narrator was a total sociopath and that the character development was inadequate.  Those of us who liked it, including one member who visited India last year, felt that it described India on the frontier...not unlike stories that some of us (myself included) have heard from older relatives who can remember before we all moved to the suburbs and got civilized.  My major criticism was that the book veered between two genres--satire and contemporary novel.  I think it would have been stronger had it been consistent, one way or the other.
B002W1UEW4|3.0|I like action movies, but this one just didn't pull it off for me. It basically felt like a big showcase of one-liners and B-grade CGI. If you're in the mood for something a little campy, this might do.

0061726834|3.0|Lena Holloway is a normal 17 year old girl growing up in Portland Maine.  Except in this version of Portland Maine, love is a disease, and at 18, everyone gets a procedure, lobotomy light for lack of a better term to cut the emotion right out of the brain.  Lena has had plenty of experience with the \\"disease\\" and plenty of experience with the procedure as well.  Her mother had the procedure and it didn't take, the \\"doctors\\" tried the procedure three times and finally Lena's mother committed suicide.  In spite of that, or maybe because of that, Lena is looking forward to her procedure.  Lena's friend Hana is not so sure, Hana's beautiful, fun-loving and a free-spirit, everything Lena  thinks she isn't, she thinks of herself as average looking, and is looking forward to the evaluation that will get her matched up with her eventual husband, all provided by an all-seeing all-knowing government.<br /><br />On the day of Lena's evaluation some anti-government resisters called Invalids let some cows into the evaluation room and Lena's test results are ruined.  It's a good thing someone let the cows in the room, because Lena was tanking in her evaluation, getting too emotional, all signs of the \\"disease\\" she thinks.  She is glad her procedure date is coming soon.  Out of the corner of her eye, Lena sees Alex, a guard at the evaluation center.  She's taken aback at how handsome Alex is, but she hasn't had a lot to compare him to since boys and girls don't congregate much if at all. But Alex is safe because he's had the procedure done. They meet again as Lena and Hana go out for a run, and this time she's annoyed that he doesn't remember her.<br /><br />They meet a third time when Hana invites Lena to a rave, more like a barn dance in this Portland Maine, and the dance gets raided by the ever present regulators, a citizen goon squad who supplements the police, it's Alex who helps Lena escape the goons.  Now, they start to spend more and more time together, Lena's sneaking out more and more before curfew, staying out later and later and the unavoidable fact is that Lena is in love with Alex, and he loves her too. But Alex is not what he appears to be.  And what's more, Alex may know a secret about Lena's mother.  Who is Alex? The seemingly straight arrow guard, who is breaking all of society's rules for Lena?  What does he know about Lena's mother?  Can their burgeoning love save them from life in a totalitarian society?<br /><br />This is an interesting book with a fascinating topic.  Love in a dystopian society.  A society that thinks love is a disease to be cut out of a person like a tumor.  There is a lot to like about this book.  I like Lena, I like that she thinks of herself as average, I like that she is a runner, I like that she's insecure about herself when she compares her looks to Hana.  Most of all I like the construction of this authoritarian society, layered on top of what we know is a free country, the USA.  How did America go from the country with the most freedoms, to a walled off barbed wire encased country?  How long did it take? What precipitated it?  Not even a clue is given about the origins of this society.<br />Then there is the love story, it is so syrupy sweet that it's nausea inducing.  Here's the problem, the syrupy sweet love story drowns all the idiosyncratic little things I like about Lena, her running, her friendship with Hana, her insecurity about her looks, her sorrow over her mother's death, all the things that made Lena endearing to me, were lost in a drippy romance.<br /><br />The main messenger of the drippiness is Alex. Alex reads poetry to Lena, not any poetry mind you, Elizabeth Barrett Browning.  Alex is perfect, he's kind, he's sensitive, he tells Lena she's beautiful, but if he's so perfect why does he pick Lena a seemingly average girl?  Why does he stalk Lena?  A person only loves a person deeply that he knows well, Alex hasn't had time to get to know Lena long enough to love her, so the loveis not real, it's some author's fantasy of what love should be.  Alex's perfection makes him one dimensional, he is not a real person, real people have flaws, real people fight , not  Alex. Why do authors write flawless characters?  It's beyond me.  When we meet the man that is chosen by the government to be Lena's husband, he is some pasty-faced glue eating dweeb.  Here's a thought, how about if the guy chosen for Lena was handsome and sensitive, and intelligent, that would at least make her choice a challenge.  There is nothing to keep her home. It's trying a little too hard to be Twilight, but even Twilight had a love triangle, Delirium does not.<br /><br />Perhaps the most interesting character, Lena's mother, is mentioned only in passing a ghost that haunts Lena's memories, but nothing more.  The mother doesn't even merit a backstory.  Lena's aunt and uncle suffer a worse fate, they are dumb as posts, like the parents in those 1980's teen coming of age movies.<br /><br />Delirium.  Made me sick for all the wrong reasons.<br /><br />For more book and movie reviews, read my blog. reviewswithatude@wordpress.comis not real, it's some author's fantasy of what love should be.

B00B935SUY|5.0|As a musician that began recording on 4 track cassette in the 80's, moved up to professional studios then on to digital at home, I went through a dozen emotions during this movie.  I felt excited, sad, angry, happy and ultimately redeemed.  It made me miss the old ways of doing things and just confirmed my belief that music will never be as exciting and unique as it once was.  I could go on for hours, but let me just say that Dave Grohl has proven himself to be a genuine gift to the world and business of music.  He is a musician's musician and has used the profits of his gift to make music better for everyone.  He's the type of person that you see and always say, \\"Man, I wish I could just hang out with him.\\"  Unlike most pop \\"stars\\" that make you retch at their excess, ego and lack of talent, Dave does it for the love of the craft and the chance to make everyone else love it too.  Thanks Dave.

She is a writer, her Amazing Amy series of teen books has made her wealthy, but the popularity of those books are on the wane, and Amy now writes quizzes for magazines.  She meets Nick Dunne at a party in New York City, and the two hit it off immediately.  Nick is her equal,  he is also a writer, they share a similar wit, charm and level of intelligence, and the two eventually get married.  They are deliriously happy for the first two years of their marriage, but then both lose their jobs in the economic downturn, and they move to Missouri to take care of Nick's ailing mother.  Nick wants to open a bar, called the Bar, with his sister Margo, and asks Amy to borrow the money to get the bar going.  All of these things put a strain on their marriage, and suddenly, after the bar has opened, Nick seems cold and distant to Amy.  The coldness eventually turns to verbal and physical abuse.  Finally, on their fifth wedding anniversary, Amy disappears.  Who is responsible?  Is it Nick?  Is it Desi, Amy's ex, who may have raped her? Was it Hillary Handy, Amy's girlfriend who seems to be obsessed, with her?  Was it Margo, who's never liked Amy?  Was it Nick's father?  A raving Alzheimer's patient, who despises women?<br /><br />This book is intriguing, in that it gives you both sides of the story of Nick and Amy, from both of their perspectives, and that's rare in a murder mystery.  But along comes the plot twist, and the reveal of what happens to Amy, from there the book goes completely off the rails.  First of all, the story of what happened to Amy is fairly ludicrous, and Ms. Flynn strains credulity repeatedly with this plot twist.  She doesn't do any favors to any of her characters.  Nick is portrayed as a self-absorbed prima donna, and Amy's character is absolutely trashed after the disappearance.What the author does to Amy is almost criminal, she has taken an appealing, warm, quick witted and charming person, and turned her into someone unrecognizable, and certainly not likable.  So where to go when the book has no true protagonist, trash the media of course.<br /><br />Actually, the author does a pretty good job of describing the media hoopla over such a case, and even puts in an over the top Nancy Grace type character screaming for Nick's head in a noose every day.  But the high powered lawyer that Nick hires to free himself from the charges is pretty much standard issue stuff, nice suit, phony smile, no depth.  And the ending is disappointing as well, the book seems to be building up to a climax, and then just limps to the ending.  What is most disappointing is that it seems like women authors seem to have trouble writing strong, intelligent, women characters.  My favorite female character in any novel continues to be Jane Eyre, and that was written by Charlotte Bronte in 1847.  I've read a lot of books by female authors since then, and not one of the female characters in any of those books measures up to Jane Eyre.  That's a sad commentary on how women are written in contemporary literature.<br /><br />For more book and movie reviews, visit my blog reviewswithatude@wodrdpress.com
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great family game to play . They love waiting for the eggs to hatch. Wonderful graphics. Even the littlest ones like getting the apples.
B009FZFONO|5.0|One of the best shows ever. Great effects and not super cheesy like most zombie movies. I find it to be quite a on the edge of your seat show. Exellent!
B002E2QHBS|5.0|You cannot go wrong with this box set full of tasty nuggets. Naturally, we all wish we had the holy grail of every recorded sound from this landmark event but, this is an enjoyable alternative. Take it on a long drive !!!
B00005N6KG|5.0|I am ordering 3more!  Speedy service and I will probably be back for even more!  I can never have too many of these.
0375714839|5.0|Written by an woman born in Iran but currently living in France, this graphic novel tells the story of the Islamic Revolution from the perspective of a relatable young girl who watched as her freedoms were slowly taken away. I suggest that every American needs to read this book before making generalizations about the middle east and its people. It's funny, dark, beautifully-drawn, and a great story from start to finish.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I loved this movie sooooo much. Nicolas Sparks movies are amazing. The only thing I didn't like is the sexual behavior. But otherwise is was a very moving story.
B000H8RWEM|5.0|I've always been a fan of the 1969-70 versions of Soft Machine (Third, Fourth & Fifth), but somehow never got around to this one, the first with Karl Jenkins.  I've found it compulsively listenable.  If you like a hybrid of prog rock and early jazz fusion, you're going to like this.  DAL
B00785P2QC|4.0|So far this game is easily addictive and I love that it is free. The only problem I see is takes a while to earn the kind of money you need to expand your city...unless you want to pay for it. But it can be done with patience. Overall, a good game for anyone.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Keeps you very interested.. surprise ending. So not expecting that. Can't wait to read the last book. At the edge of you seat kid of book
B00COHAUD4|4.0|Mama was an interesting take on a horror movie. Very Guillerimo Del Toro. If you have seen Pans Labyrinth and liked it, then I think you will like this movie also. It is very much the same style. Not too scary and it has a very interesting story line. If you are a true horror fan, then this movie is probably not for you because It is not composed of the typical elements of a horror movie. The acting is well done and very convincing. Good movie overall
B004YW4L5K|3.0|Immortals behaving as they always have but finding no room in this country for belief that isn't standardized. A romp & a frolic to read-clever sweet humor as well as  Satire & tongue in cheek dark humor.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|The name of the wind and the wise mans fear are great stories with beautiful writing. Anyone who doesn't like these books is an idiot. Only bad thing is #3 isn't written yet. So you'll have to wait for the end.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game, but too short. I hope the next room will take longer than a day to solve. Can't wait for the next update. Well worth the $2!
159463176X|5.0|I was so glad when this great book arrived.  I love this author & anything he writes is awesome.  Reading it now & I love it.<br />Glad I pre-ordered it.  And I even got a credit on the price!!!!!
B000IZJ1KC|5.0|'Between Two Worlds' sounds like a fusion of Bathory (composition style/lyrical themes), Immortal (huge riffs) and Iron Maiden (razor-sharp guitar solos). A true Norwegian black-metal supergroup, I features Abbath (best known as frontman of the mighty Immortal), Ice Dale (best known as guitarist of Enslaved), TC King (former bassist with Gorgoroth, but also founder of the bands Ov Hell, God Seed, Jotunspor and SAHG) and Armagedda (drummer of Immortal and Demonaz).<br /><br />The album has an epic sound with lyrical themes to match. Abbath's vocals sound like Lemmy gargling blood while being dragged naked through a field of broken glass. That's a good thing. The guitar work is breathtaking in its ferocity, with solos that most other bands will listen to and think, 'How the hell did he do that?' From the opening moments, when Abbath roars, \\"I ride a wind of no return,\\" the album doesn't let up. There's no self-indulgence here, just monumental songwriting and musicianship.<br /><br />If you're a metal fan and don't have this album, that's a situation you should remedy. This deserves a place in every metallist's collection.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Who ever loves minecraft get this because u can take it on the road and play at home with friends.
1907947655|5.0|Wonderful and somewhat ageless, but classic story.  This particular book printing has a good font size which is easily read.
B000X1Z0BU|3.0|Was disappointed in the stage play. Though the movie was better. The music is the best part of the story.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This fits my kindle fire HD and I got it super fast in the mail! Quick and easy ordering and shipping.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I loved the book and really enjoyed it. Could not wait to get to the ending and then was surprised by it.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|While the story can be a bit slow and seems to drag on this film is one of the greatest I've seen to date.  Loosely based on Upton Sinclair's &#34;Oil!&#34;, but changed enough that it warrants a new title.  The acting is spectacular and the ending is worth what some would consider the slow parts, which to me seem intentional.  I tell everyone that hasn't seen this movie to go see it.
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|Overall nice story which keep you thinking during the movie by asking yourself How? Why?<br /><br />However, There are something wrong with the movie that let you feel its not real or they are pretending to act !! I don't know if the problem was because of the scenario or the amount of quality efforts giving in this movie !!<br /><br />IMO .. This movie doesn't deserve more than 3 stars rating..
B008602KQI|2.0|This was a poor pop culture representation that tried to ride a noble book into profit. It ended up just putting a bad mark on the writings.
B0039RY3MM|2.0|Coollaboratory Liquid Ultra isn't all that good after a year of hard use (around 85 degrees Celsius nearly 24/7 with some idle periods). In fact, it completely hardens / dries. On my X9100 after 9 months I started seeing high temps and after 1 year auto shut downs while crunching. Turns out it was shutting off because it hit the 105 C thermal protection.  Opened it up; thermal compound was as hard as a rock. has to pocket knife blade and sand it down.  So for longevity it sucks.  I wonder if IC Diamond lasts a lot longer. A few degrees difference doesn't matter at all, it's long term longevity because the temperature difference will reverse and widen if it starts to wear out.  [...]
B00CE03UOC|4.0|I saw this and thought it was  like other flow games. Its easier and funner to do :) I'm glad i down loaded it
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|Best Dollar I Spent-Since I Tricked My Smoking Sloo Cousin;) Hi Page/: Replay Value==U Know Dam Right!!! Punching Monsters in the FACE!!! You Take this LOVE&bull;&deg;}
B009AMANBA|1.0|The movie is not about Lincoln but about the 13th Amendment only!  The history is very misleading.  If you expcet to see Lincoln and his administration during the Civil War, you will be disappointed.  I do not recomment the $19.95 purchase.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|If you liked the other Bourne movies, you will like this one.  It does not have Matt Damon in it but is following another man who was in the same program as Jason Bourne.  The movie is the story of a government agency gone awry and now trying to cover their tracks by eliminating those who have worked for them, and those people struggle to outwit their previous employer.
B00884GR0W|4.0|This is a really fun game but kinda hard to control. It lets you take spawners that spawn either enemy mobs or normal mobs. DO NOT PLACE THE VISITORS ANTIQUE SPAWNER OR YOU WILL GET REALLY ANNOYED. They hop around then if they can't see you they'll atoumaticly teleport to you. Over all its a great game and do not listen to the bad reviews if you can't control it well just go on the options menu. To get game instructions just play story mode.<br /><br />I HOPE THIS WAS A GOOD REVIEW
B00785P2QC|5.0|Super addictive watching your city grow. Have it on every tablet. Been playing every day for 6 months. Would like to see other types of new buildings.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I always look on Google for everything, its easy to use and very quick. I recommend Google to everyone.  LOVE IT.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I love getting a funny, good and all in one book. I don't have to worry about it being a sequel and trying to remember it months ahead of time. Thank You Ms. Chase.<br /><br />I have to say this was one of the most different books I have read lately, with the male telling us the story. Drew tells you how men think and feel in this story, and on top of it, he's hilarious. Great book and I highly recommend it.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Great way to kill time at work when there is absolutely nothing to do, and you just need something to get you to the end of your shift.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I like the various ways the author approaches his fundamental point: the cue-habit-reward loop. At times it seems a bit repetitive but remains an interesting read. I particularly enjoyed Chapter 7 and the insight of how companies like Target (the retail store) track customers with the power of statistics, mathematical models and computers. The way it was described reminded me of the sci-fi novel \\"Feed\\". I recommend this book to any person trying to understand how we humans live our lives and figure out ways to utilize the mechanism of \\"the habit\\" to pursue goals and live them in more fulfilling ways.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The game is just as fun as the first one, but there is a couple of glitches in the game. I'm looking at you, narrow areas.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|It is one of the best games in the world I bought it today and I love it. It has free roam
1451668945|2.0|So glad I wasn't the only one who wanted to just put this book down.  Too many characters reacting in total uncharacteristics ways.  Sorry but regardles of the Vietnam vets issues; after 40 years I doubt his wife and son would have reacted that way.  When you have this many characters who have no idea of the others characters \\"story\\"; each time you introduce a story line and then jump back and forth from all these different story lines; things are repeated.  After midway I was totally tired of hearing Hannah, her friend, Gus' wife, fire marshalls all lament the same thing over and over; was Kate responsible.  While the jest of the story in some ways, find new words to express.  In this book, 95% seemed repeat filler.  A means to prolong to full novel length, a very small boring story. There was no interest in the dad or his forman.  And none of the women seemed very bright, I just wanted to put the book down.  So why did I finish?  It was predictable from the opening chapter and I wanted to see if this was going to be part of the plot, a total fake off of the reader or what I feared; a who dunnit that no one was fooled about.  Don't waste your money; you'll find this easier to solve than Clue.
0618154043|5.0|This books is a great resource for any Tolkien fan, for it expounds upon many many tales and fills up the corners of Lord of the Rings itself.
B00B4VI8MQ|2.0|This was fun, at least for the first three mini-games. Then came the pop-up to pay. I did. The very next mini-games doesn't work. The hidden item is behind the back button. I have seen reviews where people got past this but I have spent a little bit of time trying to no avail. However they get past it, this game is getting a low review from me because I paid for it. Glitches like this should be caught before asking people to pay.
0765325950|5.0|Sanderson did a good job finishing up the series. I had a few moments when the sheer joy of the moment nearly overwhelmed me.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I was never bored with and it was different then most books, I have read. I can't wait to read the next book..
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I loved this book. It had everything. It was sad, very funny, beautifully written and a great story.<br />The lovely 'Irishisms' and the typical country Irish wit made me laugh out loud as I read.<br />The parallel story of the man's tragic childhood enhanced the reading experience. The ending was unexpected and left me wanting to know more about their futures.I will read more by this author.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|I think it is a good game and it is fun for everyone to play and enjoy anytime and anywhere
B00ALM822K|3.0|I like John greens books , he is an amazing writer and he does a good job of making a text resonate with the reader. But I feel like he has a few of his books that have a similar summary description ,just written in different ways , that is not necessarily a bad thing. But it does have its downsides if you have read one of the similar books<br />I will not say what the books are so as not to show spoilers
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is a fun and addicting game that I fell In love with. Also if this game could have had more than 5 stars.

0525425764|5.0|this book is perfect for young readers because it relates to young people, and even I as an adult find the Theodore boone series fun and interesting to read, I loved it and will also continue to order the series as well.
0646497855|5.0|I can't explain how good is this book. It has the real technics of the IELTS test it helps you to maximize your score and how to answer the questions in the best way! If you want to get the IELTS score, Buy this book without thinking and worrying about the price it's really worth it

B004VMUS9G|3.0|I wish it was louder but I know that has something to do with my device. I have nothing bad, nor nothing good to say about it. It's an alarm clock.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This was a great movie. Very entertaining and I loved the music. It was almost like watching Glee as a movie. Rebel Wilson is awesome as &#34;Fat Amy&#34;!
0385536828|4.0|\\"Who are you writing the story for?\\" That's often the first question an aspiring author hears during a writer's workshop critique. It seems clear to me that McEwan wrote \\"Sweet Tooth\\" more for his own pleasure than for the book's readers. He's showing off, doing a turn as the male author who can write from a woman's point of view as well, if not better, than most men and many women writing literary fiction. Give the man his due, the task is formidable, the result is not half bad.<br /><br />To succeed, to get the answer he's looking for from the mirror, he needs to convince you that Serena, his first person narrator, is not a female impersonator (even a great one like Robin Williams in Mrs. Doubtfire, but the real McLoed (Mata Hari) in this secret service  novel. Serena, two affairs into the book, finds herself passed along to the staff of Britain's M15, its homeland security agency. A very attractive, sexually accomplished, well-read young woman when the story starts in 1972, her taste for reading leads to  a special assignment for M 15.  Her mission:  persuade an up and coming author to accept funding disguised as a legitimate foundation grant so that he'll be able to devote himself to writing  anti-communist works. So what starts out for Serena as what might be called an \\"all in the day's work\\" romance, ends up being far more complicated.<br /><br />One wants to give Serena, or rather McEwan the benefit of the doubt, to put the the book down thinking that a woman author could not have made the lovely Serena more convincing.  It would be interesting to hear what Helen Simpson or Tessa Hadley have to say on that score.  My guess is that they would give McEwan an A for effort and a solid B for achievement. Serena is situationally  worldly, as in her understanding of Jeremy, her gay lover's inability to fully respond to her in their lovemaking, but rather naïve in her reading of Max, the M 15 officer she spurns at her peril. Serena sheds emotional turmoil with uncommon ease, a trait more often associated with men than women.<br /><br />To sum it up, McEwan had a good time writing \\"Sweet Tooth.\\" He showed us what he can do when he puts his mind to writing from a woman's point of view. The mirror might well have told just that, but also that he does even better when he sticks to his last.<br /><br />End note.  It is also difficult for women authors to write from a man's point of view. And when they do, they are more likely to rely on an omnipotent narrator than to tell the story in the first person. Annie Proulx takes both approaches in \\"Heart Songs and Other Storie,\\" her first book. She relies on a male narrator in \\"Stone City\\", one of the strongest stories in the collection. \\"Heart Songs\\" - the title story, like several of the others, uses the omnipotent narrator to tell what is basically a man's story. Ron Rash, one of the authors this collection  brings to mind, could not have created Proulx' men folks more tellingly.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|Long time fan of Tom and recently saw him in concert. Picked up the CD based on the show and it is one of the best of 2013.<br />Highly recommended!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great story that alternated between his and her points of view, continually getting smaller, quicker, more intense in the repartee like a fine musical composition until you are completely sucked in for the ending.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read.....love,love,loved it!!! Highly recommend it to anyone that loves a good love story.
1594487154|4.0|First, note that you could have the best idea in the world, if you can't communicate it, it is irrelevant.  And if you can't PERSUASIVELY do so, it is almost equally as relevant.<br /><br />Now, if you agree that we are all in the &#34;business&#34; of persuasion under one form or another - what Pink calls &#34;non-sales selling&#34; - look at the two following variations :<br /><br />- Sales Selling: engaging with prospects, persuading them of the value of a product/service and &#34;closing a deal&#34;. This is the traditional image we get from &#34;sales&#34;. Pink has a number of tips for this category of activities.<br /><br />- Building persuasive systems that engage with prospects and help drive your point. Building empathy, designing a complete experience with an interlocutor, getting feedback, etc.  Pink provides an excellent cross-disciplinary perspective on this variation.<br /><br />Contrary to some reviews, this book doesn't reflect that Pink is a good &#34;thinker&#34; but rather a good &#34;aggregator&#34;. His recommendations are based on a variety of researches ranging from cognitive sciences to art to business, in addition to the pure anectodical that you may choose to get entertained with or ignore. I got entertained.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|This is the best online game I've played on tablet. The controls take a little getting used to, but I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Single player would not be appropriate for kids but also well done.

B00AGKHEUI|4.0|Disc #3 consists of outtakes & early versions of songs from Rumours. Includes a cool version of Silver Springs, the song that was intended for the album but that didn't make it on (in my opinion, should have left off Oh Daddy to make room). Also includes an exquisite short song, Doesn't Anything Last. Wonder why the Mac didn't do more with it.<br /><br />Interesting to hear how The Chain came together because you can hear pieces of it in at least two songs: The Chain (demo) by Stevie Nicks has the famous chorus \\"If you don't love me now...\\" although the rest of the song is completely different. The other Chain part is in Keep Me There by Christine McVie which includes the riff that plays behind the \\"If you don't love me now...\\" lines. Remember, this is the song that all five share credit on. If there are other outtakes that contain the rest of the song, would be great to hear.<br /><br />LOVE Stevie Nicks's version of The Chain. Instead of the anger you can hear on Rumours -- which I also love -- hers is haunting & heartbroken. You can hear more of a country influence in her voice back then. Her grandfather was a country singer & I'm sure that's where it came from.<br /><br />Beautiful harmonizing between Buckingham & Nicks on Never Going Back Again. You can hear the creative process going on with him in Second Hand News & Go Your Own Way when he sounds out vocally the guitar pieces that he lays down in the final polished piece.<br /><br />I like these versions of the songs partly because I've heard the original Rumours literally thousands of times, so it's great to hear a fresh take. But partly I like these versions because they're more raw, unpolished -- the vocals aren't so smooth & I like that sort of music now.<br /><br />I only give this four stars because it's pricey for just the one disc I wanted. I already have the other two: Rumours & Fleetwood Mac Live but since it was going to be more expensive to download Disc #3, I opted to buy the whole thing. Bottomline: if you love Fleetwood Mac, you MUST have Disc #3!<br /><br />Now if only Lindsey Buckingham & Stevie Nicks would go ahead & release Buckingham-Nicks on CD already! Used to have that on vinyl.

If you are a fan od &#34;Diner Dash&#34; this is a game for you!
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book is a laugh out loud, romantic, man perspective, funny kind of book... I loved drew and Kate...this is a must read book.

B00992CF6W|4.0|It's a great a addicting fun game for all ages. But an update would be good to have. Other than that it's creative. So if you have creative kids, I recommend this for them. It's basically legos, but at a whole new level. Let yourself be the creater of a park,city, whatever.
B0044C3RB4|4.0|I enjoy this season, but I think the crazy Walter keeps me coming back for more.  And how they've switched it up keep it interesting.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I read it in 2 days! I have been reading tons of these types of books but this twist with the story told from the male point of view was fantastic. I laughed out loud throughout and fell in love with the jerk instantly.  I also appreciate the story ending without a wait for the next book ending. I could read this one again. Seriously buy it!
B005HEFB6M|5.0|This is the nitty gritty beginnings. An excellent crew, not as glamorous as the other ones as the future is less futuristic. I like it because it brings the idea that it is possible sooner than you think.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I like this radio app better than the heavily advertised competitor. A note to those one star reviewers who are upset that the app won't install; it is fixed now so at least have the decency to change your review.

B004UJAOLM|5.0|I think to get the full benefit from this book I'll have to read it again. The emotions were so overwhelming that I need time to digest before real understanding sets in. The mind and heart are so complex in this story that this book will stay with me for a long time.

B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My daughter downright refused to watch this at first, stating it was for boys. We ran out of options, and finally rented it anyway. She loved it! She watched it 4 times during our rental, and we'll probably end up buying it for her. Great for kids, and anyone who grew up playing these games.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|neat work, compact, light-weighted and inexpensive<br />very easy to install<br />I've been using this product for more than a month already, and it works very fine.

B00BMKDTNC|3.0|I guess that after so many books in this story and so much waiting between books I got bored. The first 5 books are great and after it's getting very slow....
B008IGP8RI|2.0|I think if I had seen the movie, I would have enjoyed this more.  I do like Nick Cave's music.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|I usually don't enjoy angry birds, but since it is the star wars addition, it got me playing again.  I enjoy the story line and the characters dressed up as star wars action figures.
B00BCOQSSQ|2.0|It was an interesting story line but was written in a hastened tone. I would put the book down so many times after only reading one page. The book was okay but the way it was written was unappealing.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Would have been interesting in 3-D. Excellent companion to the Firefly series. No waiting to watch again.<br />Cause I bought it.
B008PNBU30|5.0|I listen to it when there are a lot of commercials on the radio. The music is great, love it
B001EN71CW|5.0|Excellent sci-fi series. Sorry there was not cable or network follow-up. Glad I bought it. Well worth the money I spent.
B004Q7CIFI|4.0|At one time or another, I believe everyone wonders what it would be like to go back in time & change history.  Steven King lets us live that fantasy.
B009NY43NY|5.0|CONTAINS SPOILERS:<br /><br />I have been a Sookie fan since Book One and I truly enjoyed this book. Many other fans' reaction has been negative. One of Charlaine Harris' gifts as a writer is to make the reader get attached to and feel invested in the characters. Team Bill fans and Team Eric fans are likely to be disappointed- some to the point of ire and bitterness. To me, this indicates how successful Harris has been in creating the Sookie Stackhouse/Southern Vampire world: readers feel a sense of ownership.<br />Sometimes, when we care about someone, we are disappointed in their choice of romantic partners. And it is obvious that many readers (including myself) care very much about Sookie. Bravo, Charlaine for making this happen!<br />I admit, I was not a Bill fan. I liked Eric, but I felt that there was no \\"forever\\" for Sookie and Eric. Sookie chose Sam (which is something that has been building up since the beginning). Fans who are shocked should go back and reread the whole series, as the Sookie/Sam relationship has been building since the beginning.<br />One thing that worried me was that Sookie would be forced to be a telepathic slave to the vampire community, which was resolved in a good and plausible way. Supporting characters got their resolution too.<br />So some Bill and Eric (or Alcide) fans seem to be pouting (at best) or hostile (at worst) because Sookie didn't choose their man. But it's a fact that in real life one can try to fix up two friends for a romance and it may not work out. You can lead a horse to water, folks (or lead a girl to a handsome vampire)... I say get over it.<br />Bottom line is: Harris is the writer and the ultimate decision as to the characters' fates is in her hands. I feel she did a great job of tying up loose ends and bringing the series to a satisfying conclusion. Major and minor characters had their resolution and Harris wrote the book well and stayed true to her characters and to her universe.<br />Thank you, Charlaine for a great series.
B00BIVN82M|2.0|I have only played it twice and don't really like it.  I like the albums that have a lot of the old songs on them.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Fallen tree has produced another great zen puzzle game and made it even more interesting with the unfolding story line. thank you!!!
1118109791|5.0|This is a very cool GMAT book for studying the exam. I bought it for my son, because he needed it to tutor someone to prepare for the GMAT exam last year.
1442358238|4.0|THIS ONE GOT 4 STARS FROM ME NOT AS GOOD BUT STILL GOOD AND YES I WOULD RECOMMAND TO READ THIS ONE.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I'm so thrilled I can watch episodes I either missed or wanted to re-watch at such a low price. NBC didn't air one particular episode on tv and when I found out, I bought it and saw it on here and it is by far my favorite ep! Thank you so much for offering this service! I really enjoy this show
B0007KS7D0|5.0|Wanted just a little more depth of field than the DCR-250 provided (although I am also in love with it) and got it with this.  What an amazing buy and such a dandy product.  Move forward and back to focus, and you'll be very pleased with this product.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|LPS is totally RAD!!!!!!!!(: this fun filled game is so incredibly AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!( the best part is it's  like totally FREE!!!)
B0015AARJI|3.0|Multiple batteries have gone dead on me or not even been hooked up on the inside. Some are lemons others work just fine. It's hit or miss but for the price it's worth a try.
B008458O3S|5.0|Absolutely amazing game that starts off as really simple and ends up being fiendishly difficult. It is very addictive.<br /><br />The graphics and game design are clear and well laid out. It is worth every penny of its price tag.
0307891372|5.0|This book includes all missions and most of the other content in the game. The book though does NOT cover DLC. If your in need of assistance in navigating the enormous world of Skyrim this will be the book you need. Highly recommended.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Fun u would love it and it doesnt want ur money like in smurf city but anyway i would get it is i were u!
B0002O7XW2|5.0|The movie is a good suspense movie about an automobile that has it's own mind. I love your movie selections.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Well this is the most coolest game in the worldwide and u get to kick but and buy cool stuff and that's why I like it.
B002BW6S7Y|5.0|If you like Amon Amarth, than you need to own one of these!  It's one of their best, but then again, all of Amon Amarth's albums Rock the Friggin' House!  Buy them all!  NOW!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a fun game it just takes to long to update to the new cities I'm missing out on all the action. Somebody please fix this issue
B00AFROVQC|5.0|This is one of the best books i have ever read. In my class i need to write about the book i read, and when i run out of books i look to Morgan Rice!
B00992CF6W|1.0|It will not update. I have been waiting for a long time. Also when you are in creative mode you can't spawn anything.! You can't get any mods . I am so pissed off
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A  wonderful story with universal appeal.When will people learn that everyone wants to be loved,know who they are and where they come from?
B009RH9J7W|5.0|Very nice, I am pleased that I got it.  I have told all my friends that have a Kindle that they should get one.  It's great
B005K17RU0|4.0|I really like the radar. I can look up different regions of the country easliy and go back to my region in no time.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Like it.  You really have to pay attention to this game.  Moving fast is really a mind over matter fun, it is exciting and you are really pushing yourself to stay on top.  Some times I have a real challenge on my hands.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It's great to have the weather at my fingertips wherever I go. How much simpler can it get? Thank you
B002RKSCA6|4.0|This was written in 1886, so the story is told with the sensibilities of the times. As I was approaching the end, I was disappointed and ready to give it up. The pay-off comes in the final confession, where you finally understand the nature and threat of the monster in this horror story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you like temple run you definitely going to like this you have to dodge obstacles and avoid getting caught by the cop you visit a new place pretty much every month and its a bit easier then temple run but just as fun
B00BLGXL3U|4.0|Generous with a 4-star since 3 1/2 is not possible. Joaquin should have won the academy award for acting, along with Phillip. They play what on surface you would consider two ends of the spectrum - one in total control and one absolutely out of control. But all is not as it seem as both live in uncertainty and with deep misgivings. The title is actually the opposite of all characters in the film - they are not masters of their lives. A telling scene actually involves the character played by Laura Dern who is bewildered by the shift in the premises established by the \\"master\\" in his first book and how it is totally changed in the second book. Still, it takes patience to follow the story and if not for the acting, would probably lose most of the audience early in the film. Again, Phoenix is fantastic and all the other actors are very good but it's not a story that will endear itself to a large audience.
B008VBYN80|4.0|I have fun playin and am happy with the games setup. Cool there is now a game chat and sending gifts are crucial. Should be a better way to subscribed requests though.
B00AVL23YE|1.0|Did a DL of this app, turned out crashing every time I checked my mail.<br /><br />Then an email arrived from Google telling me I had activity from Tel Aviv Israel trying to hack into my account-the good old \\"suspicious activity change the password\\" kind of notice which raises the eyebrows.<br />Now, maybe this app was bouncing around servers, which is the norm. Possibly it was an attempted hack attack. Regardless I changed my PW, deleted this app from my Kindle. Not sure how this happened but if you put 1+1 together and keep the brain open after you install an app resulting in  weird things arising then you have to CYA.
B001LF3YQK|4.0|This item is well worth its money, small and convenient for its price. The wipes do dry out eventually, but it took over a month for that  to happen. I would recommend this item.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|The story was action packed and adventurous, but the typos totally ruined it. Don't buy this book on the kindle.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Not a typical young adult novel.  Just a cleanly written story with very serious and realistic theme. More should read it.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|This season will enthrall you and you will be helpless to stop watching it.<br />WARNING: Significant others may resent you for staying home and watching this when you were supposed to be going to their sister's wedding.
B005BY3XHC|5.0|If one of Deepak Chopra's Laws of Success touches you in some way, it would be worth the read! Very deep and profound, not a book meant to be rushed through. Very enlightening.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|This show continues the epic story of Walt and Jesse as they travel deeper down the rabbit hole of the methamphetamine cartel.  Superb acting, excellent writing, everything is perfect in this show down to the smallest details of each set.<br />And, it's better than having a girlfriend, anyway.  Who needs you, Allie?!  All you do is complain, &#34;You used to pay attention to me, not the TV,&#34; or, &#34;Why do you always say 'BI#$H!' at the end of every sentence now?&#34; Psh, you're worse than Skyler.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|An enjoyable way to pass time! There is almost always more than one way to beat a level, but only one way to get all three stars!
B00992CF6W|2.0|honestly its better just to get the actual game on the Pc because seven dollars just for a few things that are in the game really isn't worth the time or money.... its just not worth paying for this when its only in 0.6.1...really?! maybe it will be worth it after the big 0.7.0 update coming soon just not now though really. its a good game but it really has nothing compared to the Pc version...if u really want to get this edition at least wait for the update.
B007LGPSX0|5.0|Good flashback, still like i remembered glad out was an option! Hope to get season 2 on prime i love the 90's and this show brought out back for me.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|It's been a long time since I've found a book that liked as much as Armor by John Stakely, but this one came close and felt a bit reminiscent. There the right amount action and drama with believable science. Definitely worth reading.
0767020308|5.0|My very first Jane Austen movie was Emma, bought on Ebay in VHS and I watched it over and over.  Kate Beckinsale is an excellent Emma.  Mr. Knightly is a favorite in this portrayal.  Handsome but compassionate. Emma overrates her abilities as a matchmaker after the marriage of her governess and a nearby gentleman and attempts a second which turns into disaster.  There is so much action in this story which has a great secret at its heart.  Although it is more condensed than the Emma in my Jane Austen Collection, it is bright, colorful and the story flows well. It is a great addition to any Austen collection.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Well said!!  This is a must read for all, both men and women can benefit from reading this book. Brava!!
B000YIGNKE|5.0|It was a wonderful addition to my Persuasion Collection.  The story is the same but the beginning and ending are really well done. This Ann Elliott character was most believable and you felt some compassion for her and a little anger at Lady Russell who seems to always be around.  She is moderation on two feet while her father and sister Elizabeth are the excess and extravagance in their lives at Kellynch Hall.  How many of us would not take every advantage of renewing a true love if it proved to be available once more. In this case the silence was golden.  This movie is well done and the scenery at the ocean was spectacular.  I guarantee that it will be an oft-watched movie in your collection.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I would have given 4 stars but I had to unload and reload due to loading problems and I lost all purchased items and all my experince i was level 17  and i had to start all over again if kindle can fix this i would have given it four maybe four and a half stars
B004XVMCMQ|5.0|Fanny Price has got to be one of the most straightforward heroines of Jane Austen's works.  She is brave although feeling abandoned by her mother at first.  As she grows up, she learns through her adversity and feelings that in order to have the life she wants and most likely deserves she must stand true to her beliefs and integrity.  Her love for Edmond has to be an example of patient desire even in spite of the attractions of Mary Crawford and the dastardly plans of Henry Crawford in securing her favor.  Austen's characters exhibit the many forms of human nature and she describes them to a &#34;T&#34; especially in this story.  It demonstrates that no matter what century you live in there is a degree of dysfunction in the family and how it is contained with dignity and integrity is someone's real life story, published or not.  In this case, Fanny Price does well to find where she fits.
B00275EGWY|3.0|With this movie garnering 6 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, i was expecting a great flick. Instead, this movie never really developed the characters, until the very end of the movie...and even then, it's weak. The one thing the movie does do well is show the emotional toll of war on the soldiers.<br /><br />If its on late night cable, watch it. Otherwise, you can probably find something else better to pass the time.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This is my favorite of all the Persuasion movies although each adds to each other.  Once you have seen them all then you are more familiar with the novel in my estimation.  Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root make the story so believable and romantic.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|Its so fun to see how pretty makeup and jewelry can make us! and my daughter can play with makeup without making a mess with mine
B006LSZECO|5.0|At the beginning I was a little bored but as I kept reading I realized how twisted and original this story really is. I definitely recommend it. It will also make u really appreciate your spouse
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It took awhile to really get into the story line, but once it heated up, the book was hard to put down!
B00BFBSV72|4.0|I think this game is off the hook ,great graphics and good controls all sonic fans should get it,the reason I didn't give it  5 stars is because is hard to level up
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|I've never heard or read the books, but I really enjoyed the movie.  The accents were a bit annoying, but as the movie went on I got use to it.  I understood the movie and didn't get lost from the story line like other reviews..It really just matters on a person's taste on movies.  Not everyone will like it, but there will be some who do.  Just like with any movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is super fun and I love that it's free. Very realistic too. No harm in just trying it out. =)
B005GFPZYK|4.0|This book was very insightful, I enjoyed reading about the experiences the author had on his deployment it gave me a better understanding of what's goin on over there in Iraq.
B004Q9TYWQ|5.0|I read this book one night after everyone had gone to bed and was afraid I would awaken everyone as I laughed out loud. I frequently had to take a break because tears of laughter were running down my cheeks and I couldn't see to read.
B00AB7HESI|2.0|I couldn't get it to download! It made me sad too; its my favourite game right now so... I was fairly disappointed.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|got to level 82 and I had so many towers my kindle just powered down. Get this game right now!<br /> it is amazing!!!!<br />Do it! Right now!
1609611543|1.0|Gluten free is not for me. I can give up my breads even though they be the high rated in weight gain.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Whew! There was a lot that happened this season! But to me it is by far the best one yet. Can't wait to see what will happen in season 4!
0399157565|5.0|I enjoy Patricia Cornwell's stories of Kay Scarpetta.  I will probably order more of the Scarpetta novels.  When does Kay plan to retire?  That's when I'll stop readi\ng them.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Optimistic and inspiring read ...you do not have to be a genious to  grow and succede in life. Main character Tesla<br /> not well know to people is an interesting and fascinating person.
B001F9Y2CM|4.0|I can see why they weren't very popular in their hayday.  their music is what one may call 'bubble gum music'.  MOMMA MIA's transformation of the music turned it around 100%
B00B7Y0206|2.0|I down loaded and deleted and redownload it didn't work right not happy wouldn't recommend until it la fixed hopefully by now it is
159463176X|4.0|This book should come with a warning label...once you start reading it you will have to put your life on hold until you have read every last word. It is riveting. A story that will at turns make your heart ache and then show you the resilience of the human spirit. I loved it. I give this 4 rather than 5 stars because I thought the ending was a little \\"made for the movie\\"--though it did wrap the story up nicely.
B00A83075M|5.0|....of a video game character. Wreck it Ralph is surprisingly original with its cast of video game regulars as the stars. Dr. Robotnik in group therapy...Who would have thought it? The movie itself, however, does explore universal themes like self esteem, bullying, friendship, pesky bugs, and dealing with people whose need to be in power and control gets out of control. The movie is funny too and I love Jane Lynch's character. Her \\"take no prisoners\\" and so-long to kitten whixkers' approach cracks me up.
B001ANSS5K|4.0|Overall, the book was a Good read but the story dragged in some places. I like the authors attention to detail when describing Orlando!
B002I9Z8I0|4.0|A great item and looking for more units for my resale business very popular and get lots of request for it.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|App is great to watch items and to get reminders as a seller. Not the easiest for posting items for sale I still default to my laptop.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I got a Galaxy S3 for cheap (and also late) and bought this for it since it wouldn't lag anymore as it did on my Droid X (the Plants vs Zombies on my Droid was linked to my parent's account). That makes it the 5th time I've actually bought this game, and it still doesn't get old. Better than Angry Birds!
1400069807|5.0|The book represents an interesting journey into the food industry and the link between the creation of industrial food and the ongoing research of human behavior on food related themes.<br />The book is divided into three main sections, which provide an in-depth coverage of the main building block the food giants has used in order to create the modern industrialized food chain: sugar, fat and salt.<br />The book shows an objective view in presenting the evolution of food preparation methods, starting from the late XIX century till modern times, going through the main evolutionary and behavioral steps that have marked the food industry transformation, as the creation of long lasting supplies for WWI e WWII soldiers, to the exploitation of the fast food industry \\"supersize\\" format.<br />The book represents a very interesting read for those who have no previous knowledge on this subject, hence I have rated it as a five star, while I think it might be not enough technical for those who have a background on these themes.
B001A5HBJC|3.0|Having heard people talking about Mad Men, I finally broke down and ordered Season 1 on Amazon. Watched a few episodes every week. First off, be prepared for a look at 1960 that is very reflexive, meaning it distills the worst of the era into bits so repetitive that it becomes annoying. Everyone smokes in every scene (almost). Same for the drinking. Same for the racism, misogyny, and other characteristics. Certainly these evils existed, but to hit them with a sledgehammer every time distracts from the storyline. That said, there are many redeeming qualities of this show. Don Draper is an ad exec facing his own demons and an upstart exec. Don's wife and her girlfriends live in the homemaker life, casting a wary eye on a divorce neighbor. And the plot spins on from there: big money at stake, promotions, personal relationships, betrayal and more. I look forward to following the next season to see where this goes and will post another review for Season 2 separately. Hopefully, the show grows into its potential because the era, the characters, and the business have plenty of space to fill.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Enjoyed the Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry from start to finish! Such a wonderful story and full of rich life moments.
B00007KWHG|5.0|The music was the best back then.  I am so glad to have this cd - I remember where and when.  What an amazing group with so much talent.
1433502410|3.0|This bible is very large....half the page is bible the other half maps, guides, and such things. Not recommend for new bible readers.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|I was not sure if I want to watch this movie for to long until I decided to buy and watch it today , for me well spend money , I like the story and emotions , it touch me from inside as my focus was more on the story than the special effects , I even feel sorry for the MAMA ghost as she had a good side and demoing side but each mother would understand this actions and the sorrow . Great acting also , I was glad to see that the story did not focused on the father at all as he did not deserved attention after what he did at all , the main focus was love for the children and the mother's love , not matter how creepy she was the love was there .. and I did not missed 1 second of this movie watching from the beginning to the end with curiosity hoping for different ending but it was unexpected and twisted .
B005LAII80|5.0|Wanted to see this when it came out at the cinema, sadly it was never shown in my area that sucked, limited release and that and at the time all that was about was the (ugh) new Total Recall remake (yawn).<br /><br />Can't beat Arnold Hollywood, same will go with The Crow remake and Robocop remake and most other remakes, forgettable and a waste of time making them in the first place!<br /><br />Btw Dredd ain't a remake, its actually the proper Dredd from the comic book, not um Stallone's one... gotta admit though first 10 minutes of Stallone's movie I was in awe, then when he took the helmet off it was all down hill from then, still good movie at the time, but now the Real Dredd with helmet on all through ;)<br /><br />Wont spoil it, buy it, support it, heck if enough buy we might get that sequel from DVD/Blu-Ray sales.<br /><br />Anyway if you like action, buy, if you like the old Dredd, buy, if you like comic book or sci-fi movies in general BUY!<br /><br />You be glad you did...<br /><br />9 out of 10 for me.<br /><br />9 because I wanted more, as in more my Dredd fix when it finished!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I got this app free on free app of the day but would gladly pay for it. Love the way you can layer the sounds and adjust the volume on each one. I can shut my kindle off and set the timer (so I can go to sleep) and it will shut itself off, saves battery life. Has plenty of sounds to chose from.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this app it is fun is a lot of vehicles but most have to have a lot of upgrades in order for the car to be good my fav level is highway
B0018QOIXU|4.0|Heart wrenching lyrics, incredible vocals, and songs that exude so much soul and essence -- you can't help but love the woman behind them. This is a wonderful soul/r&b album. Each track tells a story -- stories of love, triumph, and heartache. Stories that its listeners will undoubtedly be able to relate to. And to think, Adele wrote this album at the mere age of 19. This immensely talented woman deserves all the praise she gets. Some standouts on the album to me:<br /><br />1. Crazy for You<br />2. First Love<br />3. Hometown Glory<br />4. Daydreamer<br />5. Chasing Pavements<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B00947N6UG|4.0|I love this movie. Big Russian Santa aka North with his tattoos &#34;Naught&#34; and &#34;Nice, Aussie Easter bunny so tough yet soft inside, hummingbird tooth fairies,wonderful sandman. Everyone so unique, check out North's helpers. Everything so beautiful and a great story message.  I've seen it four times so far.
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|One thing I've always appreciated about Justin is his respect for music. With him its always been about quality over quantity. Unlike some of his peers in the industry, Justin doesn't mass produce track after the track for the sake of selling records and winning awards. He takes his time producing tunes with unique, stylized rhythms that suck you in from the beginning of the track 'til end. He certainly did this on FutureSex LoveSounds. And attempts to do it again on the 20/20 Experience. While this album didn't have quite the impact on me that his previous two had, I still enjoyed several tracks and perceive at as a pretty solid record. Justin experiments with different sounds on this album -- giving each track it's own unique flavor. He continues with his production of fast paced dance tunes that make you want to get out of your seat and move. There are also a few R&B tracks with a groove and feel good element.<br /><br />Some stand out tracks on the album for me:<br /><br />Spaceship Coupe - An interesting concept for a song with a SICK beat that you can't help but bob your head to and lyrics so catchy you'll find yourself singing a long every time the track comes on.<br /><br />Pusher Love Girl - My favorite track on this album in terms of lyrics. Justin compares his love for his woman to the love an addict would have for a narcotic. Some really playful lyrics here.<br /><br />Tunnel Vision & Don't Hold the Wall - Both high energy tracks that make you want to get up and dance.<br /><br />Mirrors - A beautiful ballad with a melody reminiscent of JT's music during his N*SYNC days.<br /><br />Most of the tracks are well over 6 minutes long -- in true JT fashion -- you can tell he never wants the music to end and tries to extend the rhythms and melodies of each track as long as he can. This album will take you on a ride. A fusion of different genres, unique lyrics, catchy beats, and a truly talented artist with a vision. Unfortunately there were, what I consider a few duds on the album as well -- which is why I only give the record 3.5 stars. Suit and Tie is bland and anti-climactic to say the least. Strawberry Bubblegum is so mellow that it nearly puts me to sleep. And That Girl seems like it should be on a variety show from the 1970s. Nevertheless, despite a few sub-par tracks, the majority of the record is good and there are far more hits than misses here. It's worth the listen, so give it a try.
B007A2O3FO|4.0|This periodic piece is almost like a murder mystery in that the writer keeps adding dark corners to the plot to keep the viewer guessing. Even the ending comes with a twist. The characters have honor or no honor, as the case may be. You just need to wait to make the final analysis.
B003G4W49C|3.0|I truly believe that books are unisex, but I think this book will generally appeal more to boys and the male gender than female readers. The character Ender gets to live most boys' dreams; going into space, becomiong a soldier and commander, fighting an alien race and in the end saving the human race. He is a loner by both nature and nurture alike and has a talent to put himself in his enemies shoes, making him harder to defeat. Ender's character is strong and sweet. He does the harsh things expected of him with a heavy heart, but with unflinching duty. This book isn't bad, I should make that clear, and I did enjoy certain chapters and aspects of the story, characters, and language. I do believe that females will love to read the chapters that encompass Valentine Wiggins, Ender's older, loving and remarkably clever sister. If the I.F. weren't so short sighted and testosterone pumped then I do believe, if given the chance, she could have solved the conflict peacefully.<br /><br />But don't let my review put off future female sci-fi fans. This book has many things to offer. It'll teach you a new way to think, it'll make you curious to the war histories of our past, and yes it will make you want to learn more about space. Even if you find the title character a bit boring or mundane at times his brief encounters with supporting characters that are both his friends and enemies will entertain you and even occasionally leave you wanting more. I give this book 3.5/5 stars and if you do enjoy it, check out the sequels.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|Steve Jobs is an extremely insightful look at one of the greatest businessmen and companies of the last 50 years. Walter Isaacson holds nothing back as he explores the mind and life of Steve Jobs and Apple.  Isaacson starts at the adoption of Jobs and continues through his life all the way until his death.  Along the way the reader learns about all of Jobs' quirks, nastiness, business savvy and relationships.  Issacson finds a way to tell Jobs' story without any personal opinion by using interviews and quotes form close family, friends, and colleagues.  Another thing Isaacson did great with was not trying giving opinions on why Jobs was the way he was.  He was not a nice guy and while past experiences and childhood could be the reason for that, Isaacson never says this or insinuates it. I got everything I wanted and more out of this book for it showed me a side of Jobs that I had never thought existed and walked me through the life of the founder of the greatest American technology company.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Fun and easy to learn puzzle game. You slide little blobs around to create one big blob. Ads aren't really that annoying
B000002GVZ|5.0|Carly Simon does not have the voice of Karen Carpenter or the hard, rock sound as by the Rolling Stones, but she holds her own superbly.  She is talented and the lyrics and composition are easy and lulling.
B00ATWT8B6|5.0|Very happy with my purchase. I love collecting steelbook movies and this is a great addition to my collection. Everything was a smooth transaction.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Fantastic!! Love that show! Great historical value of life amongst the classes in England pre WWI and after. I would highly recommend this show.
B0039NJTLQ|5.0|This is an must see movie. Full of love, lust and betrayal all in one. This drama should sit on everyone shelf.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|We've now introduced our daughters to the original series through watching these. They fell in love with it, so job well done. ;)
B008XG1X18|3.0|Tons of bugs, gets confused when I pin things, and freezes frequently. I love Pinterest,  but the app for iPhone &amp; iPad just seems to work much better. If you're going on Pinterest, stick with the computer or your apple devices.
B00C061HZY|5.0|I have always loved daft punk music. But I honestly believe this is their best stuff. If you only like electronic music, this is not for you. Be forewarned.
B00C5GZKVQ|5.0|I HATE Android game on-screen controls most of the time, but I don't mind these... The developer has gone to great lengths to try to keep the English understandable, too, despite the fact that English isn't their first language. Fun little time waster app, IMO.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|In the beginning your car is a lemon. You need to purchase upgrades to improve how you car handles the road. Luckily you earn coins quickly. Very addictive.
193700788X|4.0|I read a lot of reviews of this book after I had finished reading it.  I wanted to see how other people felt to see the books end, especially in the manner in which Ms. Harris chose to end them.  Look, I can understand some of the frustrations of the readers, but as a true fan that's been there from the beginning before True Blood (which I do actually hate), I think the final book was really good. I'm not going to say it's how I would have ended it, but I am not the writer. She has stated that she knew who Sookie was going to end up with after book 2.  She stayed true to her vision and delivered. Really, my biggest complaint is that she did not do an epilogue!  But who knows, maybe she will one of these days.  As for the plot, if you have read all of these books you know her formula for Sookie: DANGER, HEARTBREAK, INJURY, LOVE. The books are pretty predictable for that reason, but I have to say I love them for that.  Ms. Harris gave all the characters an ending even if some weren't scream in your face obvious. !SPOILERS! Who better to fall in love with then your best friend ( I should know)?  I think even more than that, Sookie realizes that no matter what, she is strong and can get through anything alone or with someone she loves and cares about.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Thats right walk around scanning for the best wifi with this awesome  product.  Love it on all of my devices.  Great for finding the best places in the house for internet.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I enjoy stories about Lincoln.  I was very absorbed with Daniel Day-Lewis' protrayal.  I feel you must enjoy history, the Civil War, and Lincoln to enjoy this movie.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|gave to sister inlaw for the extra kindle I had . it works so that's what I got it for.. she loves it
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Seen it on Direct TV had to have, it's great!! Have a lot of Eagles music great to have the  history behind it.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I often read a book in spurts, reading four to six at a time.  I read a bit of this and a bit of that as the mood strikes.  Not today.  Today I read this book almost without break.  I couldn't do anything else.  It had no slow spots.  Keep it up, Lee Child.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|Disney made a good decision in making this movie. One of my all-time favorites is Wall-E. So lovely this one is!
0060191325|5.0|Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus was referred by a friend and she was right!  Great Book and I it was in the best condition.
B0094MFITS|5.0|Good storyline. Have seen all others and this one has plenty of action. A must see to make sense of following movie s.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I use it all the time!!!!!!(:<br />Amazing how useful it's gonna be and it will make you feel intelligent  (;
B008VBYN80|5.0|I love this game only sucky thing about it is that your limited to your abilities but everything else I love
B000FBJF7I|5.0|I enjoyed I very much---sort of different from most Detective books....will probably order the next one if there is one???
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|The game was fun. I look forward to new games to come. Lots of ho games and puzzles. Some of the scenes were a little dark but workable
B008XK69S6|5.0|Great player with a very ingenious and comfortable interfase. Never hangs and till now is the best player I have found available for the Kindle Fire HD. Perfect for replacing the Amazon MP3 crappy default app.
B003THHIEM|5.0|This a great series for people who like entertainment with a bit more intelligence than the average shows out there.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|All right, finally saw it today. Since I merely \\"liked\\" Star Trek 2009, and I knew the basics of the plot, wasn't expecting to really like it.  Well I did, a lot. What an experience!!  And this is from a loooong time Trek fan (as in seeing Star Trek TMP 7 times in the theater, ha).  The first nuTrek movie didn't really touch my heart except when Kirk was born, and Spock Prime appeared (still my #1 guy, lol), but this one grabbed me.  Now I know in this day and age big-bucks budget movies are geared toward the \\"action-lovers\\" crowd and maybe a few parts of this one strained my tolerance a bit (like, how many times can Kirk get hit in the face -between this movie and the 2009 one -and not get his brains addled), but overall really enjoyed it. Would go see it again but if going to spend $11 (yikes) for a movie, I want to see it more than once, lol, so will probably wait for the DVD. Maybe I'm just not jaded by all the action pictures that the usual movie goer sees these days, so thought the movie was quite tense and exciting. But I also liked the human moments that were sprinkled around the \\"catch the bad guy\\" plot (which was a wee bit confusing for me, but I could overlook that). This is Trek as a MOVIE!! (Altho I still love my Trek TV shows & previous movies, and hope there will be a new series soon.) Highly recommended, and props to the cast for really selling me on the characters this time. Am definitely hoping for a 3rd nuTrek movie, yes!  PS Will be getting the novelization, too, hope it's good!<br /><br />Oh BTW to the critical folks who are complaining that Khan was played by a \\"white guy\\" in STID; well Ricardo Montalban was Caucasian! His parents immigrated from Spain to Mexico.  And anyway, didn't you notice how \\"white\\" Khan looked in TWOK? RM's skin was darkened in Space Seed so it wasn't that a brown skin person was actually played by a really brown skinned person in that episode.  Now, having BenedictC. play Khan in STID might be a bit of a stretch (I wascognizant of his veddy British accent watching the movie), but for me was not beyond belief, altho maybe him with a bit more of a tanned look might have been sort of helpful, lol.
0062238868|5.0|A well-written book that will hold your interest throughout. The author gives us great detail and a sense of what it was like to give true service to his country. This man was an American and deserves all of the honor and respect we can give him.
0399165274|2.0|Until this novel appeared, I didn't know that Frederick Forsyth was still alive.  Having read it, I'm still not sure.<br /><br />The single most apparent problem is that the novel is mostly boring.  The first twenty percent is largely consumed by rather tedious biographies of some of the principal characters, after which the plot finally begins to emerge.  Even so, Mr. Forsyth cannot resist quick biographical sketches of even minor characters as they appear.<br /><br />The banal descriptions of the low key acts of terrorism and the low tech hunt for the source of the religious propaganda that is thought to be fueling the terrorism is barely enough to keep one's attention as the novel staggers to an easily predictable conclusion.<br /><br />Mr. Forsyth would have been better advised to simply enjoy his retirement.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I loved this book. I lost my Mom when I was young too and I think the writer got in my head. I loved her story of how she found herself and I liked the way she described the trail.
B000PUXCPU|3.0|So I have to start by admitting that I had the privilege of seeing the classical Yes line up twice.  They blew me away and I can still remember that so very many years later.  Yes Jon still has a fantastic voice (especially for his advanced years) and all of the musicians have continued to hone their skills but it just was missing some of the rawness that made them so much more alive back then.  Maybe the video is too glitz for me but I'd much rather see this lineup live in a small venue.  My wife walked out of the room and went to bed about a third of the way through it saying &#34;I'd rather remember them from the old days&#34;<br /><br />That said, it is yes, it is the classical lineup, they were some of the forerunners of Prog and they  can still work it.  If you have never seen Yes, give it a try.  IF you have seen them live - don't bother pauing for this - save the three bucks for the next time Chris brings his current version to a town near you
B00CRR5YA0|5.0|What can I say, I am biased towards the Star Trek canon. What Michael Giacchino has done with the music of the two re-boot movies so far is a sonic treat.  Though movie music's first responsibility it to support the movie in a supporting role, this music stands on its own as great music.  I was surprised how much I liked the bonus track &#34;The Growl&#34;.  Typically I am not interested in thumping dance music but after a few listens I recognized some really great hooks and lyrics that demands my attention when it comes on.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This app does exactly what it says. Very useful if you deal with obscure fractions . There's  a handy extra bit that gives you the decimal equivalent of your fractional answer.
B008J34466|5.0|The music is powerful and draws you in, and the words ring true and realistic with the voice that is so distinctively Pink.
B00CL151G4|4.0|This is a television show that I would like to have a copy of but not going to buy it since it's not on Blu-Ray.  Why do the networks insist on releasing only on DVD when it was broadcast in HD.  You can buys digital copies in HD so why not a hard copy.  I knock a star off for this reason.
B00BX49CK6|5.0|.This is Cd is so good I can't stop listening to it all the songs are awesome I just love it.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Ellen is always worth watching/reading.  Loved her sitcom when it was on the air.  This book is exactly what you would expect from her.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|We listen to this CD all of the time.  Great guitar work, vocals and band. You won't go wrong with this record.  He is at the top of our Blues collection!
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|Pretty graphics and lots of choices of games.  Would like it more if the games had an ending like regular Mah Jong rather than making you always shuffle until there were no more tiles.  Oh, well....
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love mystery and a challenge.  Wanted to keep going.  Awesome game!  Recommended it to family and friends.  Try it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|More often than not the middle book in a trilogy is either really boring or terrible in general... but not Catching Fire!! This book was remarkable!! It kept my attention and left me wanting to read the third book that much more!! Great story, great characters, great book.
B008JJM88Q|2.0|The game was great and fun for about an hour, but after that it would even let me get to the menu with say &quot;internal service error&quot; which after multiple times because very aggravating. This problem should be fixed because right now I regret paying 99 cents.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Great cast, and good acting. Makes me want to finish reading the book. break out the popcorn and get ready to be blown away. Robert DeNiro, Jennifer Lawrence, and Bradley Cooper...my kinda crazy.
B0041KBWM0|4.0|I am still viewing Season 1 and so far, I do like it.<br />The only thing I don't like is that even at full volume, I find it difficult to hear all the conversation. I have helped it a little by using a pair of ear buds, but I do wish I could turn my Kindle Fire up louder.<br />The scenery is beautiful and the acting is well done. I love English drama!
B00CFQN12Q|4.0|I sure am glad about two things. Firstly that I read a lot of reviews saying this movie is terrible, and secondly knowing that most of the time public reviews are often extremely harsh and not always fair, I'm glad I didn't listen to these people. Here, netflix, IMDB 75-90% of the reviewers either didn't like or downright hated this movie. And I read dozens at each web site. I expected this movie based on all that to be a total bomb. Truth is it's not bad at all. Certainly better than the second installment. In my opinion it's not as good as 1,3 and 4. But better than 2, which I simply thought was not very good at all. People complained that Russia is not a good setting for a Die Hard movie. well I can say it's a lot better than an entire Die hard movie set at an Airport. And in this installment the action is much better than it was in 2.<br /><br />Many of the reviews were not only too harsh but they were also totally incorrect sometimes. For instance numerous reviews complained that Willi's McClane doesn't hardly say a thing through nearly the entire movie. Totally false. He talks through most of the film only a little less than would be expected. Another is people complaining that the chase scene was 20,30 minutes long. Well it was actually about 3 or 4 minutes longer than the usual classic chase scenes we like to reference. But that doesn't matter and shouldn't. The action and destruction that takes place during this scene is some of the best I have ever seen. More cars are destroyed in this segment than have probably ever been destroyed in any other chase scene in movie history, but they are also destroyed in unique ways and it's visually realistic and extremely impressive. What's the main thing people expect from a Die Hard movie? Lots of mind blowing action that doesn't let you down. This chase as well as all the action in the movie doesn't dissapoint, it's done superbly. Some action moments are pretty hair raising and very stylishly done.<br /><br />What doesn't work in the movie well is the chemistry between McClane and his son. It's just lazy chemistry with no real heart. They are not given much as far as a script goes to work with either. Comparing it to the script and Chemistry Wills had with Sam Jackson or Justin Long in 3 and 4, it's pretty lackluster, downright terrible in comparison. There is also a lot less humor than we've come to expect and that is a let down too. The bad guys in this outing do not standout like Hans or Peter Gruber did, and there's no hot ass kicking asian girl in this one either. The movie is also not as lengthy as the other Die Hard movies. It's about 15 minutes shorter, so I understand the various reviews where people felt it could have been longer. And Willis often becoming sort of a backup man for his son seems a bit unflattering too. One of the things that we love about John McClane is that he takes control of the situation even if most of the time he feels \\"This a bad idea\\".<br /><br />So if there is a lot that just doesn't work well about this movie, then why 4 stars? Well that was a tough choice, but considering how far downhill the movie industry has drifted in the last 10 or so years, I've seen so many movies as of late that are just plain terrible or such letdowns when they promised to be great that I expected this to be even worse than those. I mean based on all the bad reviews I expected an absolute total bomb. This film is far from that. Since Hair raising action is the main reason I go see a Die Hard movie, on that level this movie delivers the goods. Very happy Willis is still willing to play in another sequel, so that's a lot better than no Die Hard to go and see. Sure the plot, script and other various things about this film seem kind of dull and feel kind of flat, but it's still a very entertaining movie, and though it's nowhere as good as the last installment I still really enjoyed it, and much more than Die Hard II.<br /><br />Still there's a lot to like about this movie. The setting of Russia as a backdrop is really very nice. It's used well, particularly arial shots make the city interesting. Lots of great moments, the plot and story are still interesting, and the movie has a lot to like about it. I think too many people expect each Die Hard movie to outdo the one before it. That was true of 3 and 4 after all, but then not true of I and II. I recommend it as long as your expectations are not set too high, you should really enjoy it. Certainly better than the 'Taken' films. More intelligent and better action. If you loved the two Taken movies, you should love this.ie. The setting of Russia as a backdrop is really very nice.

B009H5IS1W|3.0|I look at 8 ep so far and 2 was good hope it gets better this is not like 1-7 seasons
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies.  Simply a great movie for the entire family to enjoy.  It will be in my library forever.
0802130208|4.0|As the old Monty Python saying goes, \\"And now for something completely different.\\"  Toole brings to life some of the most oddball characters that you'll ever meet and yet, they're believable.  Since Toole died at such an early age and didn't leave much in terms of literary work, it's hard to label him a literary genius, but I'd goes as far to say that this is a literary work of art. 2011
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Les Miserables is the best movie I have ever seen.  Well worth the investment to own this forever. The acting and singing is incredible.
B004IK30S2|5.0|How can you NOT like the best news team around?<br />And in HD their delivery is even better!<br />This is a must have in anyone's home video collection :-)
B008XBCJ34|5.0|On my 60 inch TV this looks just as amazing as it did in the theater! Not a lot of special features though.
B009GXHOW4|4.0|this app is amaizing, weather your trying to get unlimited diamonds, butter, or iron you can always count on this. but the reason this is a 4 star is becuz if you don't put all your items in a chest and go to creative you loose all you inventory items. but still amazing
B008IJT0CE|5.0|and there r many different sounds to choose from! I have not tried to take it out of wick range yet so I don't know if it works without wifi...very helpful exept the binaral beats are just a certain frequency note that plays and is supposed to help u relax and fall asleep and such but it didn't affect me very much...maybe I have to use it longer? but still overall a great app!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I absolutely love love looove this app! It's incredibly fun and addicting, and it that manner, it deserves five stars. But I heard that you have to pay to upgrade and continue on to play, and that's pretty lame. So all in all, four stars.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|This is not a movie about airplanes or pilots. Or not only about these. It's a drama. A very deep drama with regards to alcohol, drugs, freedom and redemption. Fasten your seat belt.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|This is the story of my all time favorite band. It's very informative. I learned thing I never knew about the Eagles.
B000002O06|5.0|What a great collection of music! This album just flows from song to song. A must buy if you are looking for southern rock from the 70's
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|This is the best free game I have ever played in my life. The graphics are not good but I still like it.
076790592X|5.0|Read this without knowing what it was about and at a perfect time in my life. Extremely moving and provided me with motivation to get thru a very difficult time. Lessons: no regrets, forgive yourself then forgive others. Being at peace comes  from within, not what people give you.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it is fun but there are a few things that it doesn't need and some things that it does need.  but is is a very fun game.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a must have for your Kindle Fire if you like puzzles. Myst should have been this good.  I only wish the game was longer. I look forward to the next room.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very detailed and easy to use. Works great for kindle fire hd. No problems whatsoever. Better than other weather apps.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I love this game! The only thing that would make it better, in MY opinion,would be if there were more seek and find puzzle scenes. Other than that, it's great!!
1451695195|4.0|This book details the more intellectual side of the life after death experience and answers more scientific questions.<br />very good
B003YUC2FE|5.0|Bought this set for my kids. They love the box, though I'd appreciate some jewel cases, something more protective. The digital copies are a life saver, as we loaded them on the ipad for trips, the DVDs are at grandparents, and blu-rays at our house...essentially triple-insurance for kids entertainment no matter where we go! Pricey, but worth it to me.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|I looked at this movie multiple times to get it.  Initially, I thought I had wasted my money.  This movie engages your minds and requires you to be an active observer.  I am glad that I saw it at home.  I needed to see it multiple times to see all the different shades.  I also did a little research on it after the first viewing.  It helped to see the full picture of the movie.  It is worth seeing, just be prepared for a 3 hr viewing.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Very interesting. Does a good recap of prior information from the book before. Very quick read. Great book for young readers.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|Tried at least five players to play my avid files.  Wish I'd started with this one.  No skipping and audio is clear.
B00BCOGM78|5.0|Ever since I saw their video for, &#34;A Shotgun Named Marcus&#34;, on MTV's Headbanger's Ball back in my college days, I have followed their rise to excellence.  I saw Clutch play, for the first time, as they opened for none-other than Marilyn Manson.  Almost twenty years later, they are still burning it up.  The Clutch boys just get better and better.  Enough said.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|My kids and I loved this movie! Tom Cruise especially blew me away with how well he can sing. All the actors were spectacular.
B0049J0DC8|5.0|This is a great movie for kids and adults.  Watched this movie with my two year old granddaughter and thoroughly enjoyed it.
B003XVYLDU|3.0|Reminds me of Forrest Gump, except for the spacemen. Learned about Dresden bombing, something which I had never heard about.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|The graphics are beautiful and the game is fun and addicting. It is also educational. While building your reef you learn cool little facts about fish and the best habitats for them. The challenges are fun and easy if you have the resources. I highly recommend this game.
B003WC5EQI|3.0|A beautifully done period drama that was one long, sad train wreck of a movie.  You don't want to stop watching because it is well made and acted, and you so want things to go well for Tess, but they never do.  Even several months later, I still can't decide if I love it or hate it.
B00CRWJ7VC|2.0|was very hard to follow. the scenery and filming was beautiful but the sory had trouble making EASY SENSE. i might watch again to better understand
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I love the Quell series...and the new one is great!  It builds nicely on the dynamics of the original and the sequel.
0783225547|4.0|Dante's Peak moves a little slow at first, perhaps trying to show the laid back folksy life of the city in danger but once the Volcano bellows in prep of blowing it top, things move into one crisis after another.  Explosions, lava, lakes turned to acid and pyroclastic explosions.  The action moves quickly leaving you wondering right up to the end - who will survive?
B00C7DGQ9C|1.0|This movie is so bad right from the start.  Bad effects, bad directing, bad story line....where do I stop.  I love the actors in other movies so I guess I blame the Director in the end.  Sorry but this is not even the slightest bit entertaining.
B003IDMUWC|3.0|This is John Grishams first book and is one of his finest, although I didn't really like his main character as much as those in later books.<br /><br />The story had me questioning myself and my beliefs and was a real Kindle page turner.<br /><br />I highly recommend if you love Mr Grisham as much as I do.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This is a fun game to play. It reminds of space invaders, but easier. Give it a try. I recommend it
B003IDMUVI|4.0|I loved the story!<br /><br />John Grisham has done it again and this book is very difficult to put down.<br /><br />Since purchasing my Kindle, I have re read each and every book Mr Grisham has written and this is definitely in my top 3!<br /><br />I would highly recommend it for a feel good story.
B0067R0APK|1.0|This used to be my favorite weather app until they changed the version. It used to be very professional looking and  accurate. Now it looks like some cheaply made app. My girlfriend did not update her`s. I wish I didn't either. I had to find a new app. Why did they go from such a nice looking app, full of graphics to a generic text looking one I could find in a Cracker Jack box. I wish they would go back to the old version.
B00351YF52|4.0|I love, love, love John Grisham, although I am more prone to his earlier stuff.<br /><br />This book delves a little into the legal stuff which I find so interesting, but it seems this maybe one of his last books to do so.<br /><br />I would only recommend this if you've already read his others, as this is quite light on the law.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Taubes answers all those questions swirling in your head: why do I eat like a madman after consistent workouts? Why are some just naturally fit? Can I re-direct my course? Then Taubes not answers those and others but what to do. A fantastic, historical, scientific read.
B003IDMUVS|3.0|I am such a fan of John Grisham and truly believed he could do no wrong UNTIL I read this book.<br /><br />This book doesn't have the main character involved in the law as his others do and therefore, I didn't enjoy it as much.<br /><br />As a John Grisham fan, I cannot totally dislike this book, but read his others first, since if you read this one without any others, you may not go back for more.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Free texting and pics for my kids to keep in touch with grandma & grandpa 2000 miles away on their itouch or kindle. And its free!!!!
B003IDMUSG|4.0|This is in my top 3 John Grisham books!<br /><br />The book is a definite Kindle page turner and I couldn't put it down!<br /><br />From beginning to end, this has got to be one of the best stories ever.<br /><br />If I say too much, I may give away the story, so all I'll say is that I highly recommend this book!<br /><br />If you are only going to read one book this year, make it this one
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Evolve and feed your dinosaurs. It's the best game ever. Try to finish all of the missions. save up on coins to buy new things. It's awesome.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I thought the movie was to long, in the past bond movies are about 85 to 90 minutes. I wish the movie makers would better microphones, it appears that all the new movies, you can hardly hear the words, the actors all seem to mumble their lines.

B006LSZECO|4.0|An interesting, and in many ways, a thought provoking book. In the end, I'm not sure I liked it. But, I may try another by Flynn.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This Game is the best that i  have played so far in its genre!  If you're looking for hours and hours of fun, it's right here!
B00003CX5A|5.0|came in great condition. and i LOVE this movie. mr. depp is such an amazing actor and it has its funny parts and also spooky parts. its not scary at least not to me.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|I love turn based RPGs and have since NES and classics like Final Fantasy and Dragon Warrior. I put this game among those greats and am glad I got the paid version. I played the Free one for about three hours solid as soon as I downloaded it and I can barely stop since. All I can say is MORE MORE MORE!!! Please. ;)
B00AG51V8E|1.0|PLEASE don't waste your time on this garbage.<br /><br />2 of my favorites - Sigourney Weaver & Bruce Willis.  Wasted efforts, the directing was poor, acting weak, and storyline pointless.  Those were the good points.
B00A2AU0KI|4.0|Of all Clint Eastwood directed movies, this one is not the best, but it still is a very, very good movie. Acting was excellent, and it was a good story, with a good ending. Predictable, but a very enjoyable, feel-good movie.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|i loved this game, i will be waiting for more rooms. i did have to turn the sound off because some of the noises freaked me out
B007LGPSX0|5.0|I watched this show to see if it was better or as good as themes 90210.Hands down I like this 90210 better than the new one,the acting is better and overall the show seems to be better written than the new one.So I highly recommend this version  of 90210 better.Definitely worth a watch.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Excellent 5 star foreign movie. It is a very pleasant movie to watch. Highly recommend this one as it is one of the best foreign movies this year. It will certainly touch you and make you think!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Good game once you explore all of the options.  Can be a little slow at first but stick with it and make friends - it really helps.
0425269205|5.0|...So suck it haters!<br /><br />This book is a fitting end to a much beloved series.  It not only finishes off a few story lines but also leaves Sookie in a good place with a HEA.<br /><br />The actual book is a beautiful limited edition.  One of the prettiest books I own.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was my first Nicholas Sparks book the ever read. I really enjoyed it and I see myself reading more of his books.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book pulled me in from the beginning. I think I have found a new favorite book and or author.
B0073TZ1AA|1.0|Doesn't work at all. It brings up a bright white screen for a few seconds then a pop up box saying [Unfortunately,  Pdf to Speech Pro has  stopped]. And reinstalling didn't help even with restart.
B0019N8P2W|4.0|My girlfriend wanted this for her birthday and she was quite surprised when it came! She's a a huge Daria fan and was watching an episode last night! Thanks again!
B001BANK32|5.0|Classic book. Loved the characters and the pace of the story. One of Stephen King's great early works. Highly recommend.
B0053TWVDC|3.0|not a great movie, but a decent treatment of stephen king's short story which spawn many sequels. worth a look from fans of the genre.
B00BR0SGN0|1.0|Howdy fellow Amazonians (Or is it Amazonans LOL!), I love good music and giving new bands a chance...but this Deep Purple band did a horrible job on their debut...they are too outdated to be putting out a new album! its 2013 people... get with the times! They are such a rip off of real rock groups like Staind, Bush, and Creed. Not to mention... why aren't there any dubstep bass drops? no cameo appearances from Justin Bieber or Kesha.....? these guys have a long way to go if they want to join the ranks of good rock artists like Nickelback and Creed.<br /><br />For GOOD music check out William Hung, Keith Sweat, Lil Rob, Toby Keith, the New Radicals, Paris Hilton, and Rebecca Black!!
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|But if I where to say more, her music is pure joy, and she just might do for the violin what electricity did for the guitar.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I loved this book. At first I thought it would be another of those books about a son accused of murder and the parents struggles with it. It was that but told in a new way with a twist at the end. I couldn't put it down. I will definitely look into other books written by this author.
B008I3QZKU|4.0|This has some good songs on it and it has the same feel as the other Killers albums, it is just not my favorite.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|This is a fabulous movie...great music, story, humor, acting, feeling, just love it!  Also recommend buying the CD for the great music.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is awesome but like I said needs an update but other than that pretty cool I would like to see spawns eggs next.
B0079L2XTE|5.0|This is one of the best  movies of 2012, don't miss it.  Really great acting, story, writing, music and quite a lot of humor.  The audience laughs a lot.  Everyone I have told to see this movie has loved it (except for my aunt and she has no sense of what a good movie is, or of humor).  I bought the dvd and the cd, still play it.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This is a lot of fun they're is a lot of things you can do in this game lots of different vehicles you can drive lots of missions fun game a must have.
B0091REZMW|1.0|Every time trying to open it it says it's not responding !!!  Don't bother downloading. it is a waste of your time.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The books where great to read. They where the best books I have read in a long time and will be a favorite of mine forever.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|As a huge fan of the first two Quells (Quell and Quell Reflect), I have been on the edge of my seat for 6 months, waiting for Memnto..  It was 6 months of disappointment and postponements.  But, oww that it's here (a day early and a dollar cheaper), it was totally worth it!!!<br />The basics are the same.  But, the colors are better, the music is even better, the voice of the old man is new, but great and fits in perfectly.  There are more hidden levels and ontop of trying to get perfect scores, there are also hidden gems and time pieces to find.  I do not think that there is a single app/game anywhere-ever that can &amp; will compete with the Quell trilogy...and now that Momento has raised the bar, there will probably never be.  Unfortunately there are only 5 stars, but it deserves far more!  Get Momento....you will NOT regret it!!!!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was actually pretty good. I loved the emotion.I thought since it was free that it wouldn't be good but I got proven wrong.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I have it on both the kindle and I-pad. I have both because the wife has one or the other.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great book. Couldn't stop reading. I hope the movie is exactly the same. Don't hesitate to buy this book !

B005GG0MIS|4.0|Good read.  The book held my attention and helped inform my thinking.  Great look into what really goes on behind the scenes!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Great stories, great chemistries among the characters as they begin as strangers and their relationships become more complex and intertwined.
B006C1DH92|4.0|I'd get it again. I wish . There was more options though. Like a training mode or more challenges. I like the puss in boots combo.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|I played this game for actually quite a few months before removing it and tagging it as a complete waste. I know I can't fault it for being a waste of time since it was free; but there was nothing much to do, honestly. I love dragons I loved that I could breed them. The programming has no major faults, but when I had to wait hours for my dragons to breed, hatch, or whatever they were doing; I need to have something to do besides the mundane dragon races to pass my time. I don't like games that don't offer even 5 min of playtime, for the few hours I had to wait to continue. Wait vs. reward not equal.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I wanted my kik on my Kindle as well as my iPhone but it won't let me have it both places. If I sign into one then it kicks me out of the other an deletes all my conversations every time. Disappointing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game has very good graphics and it is awesome the only thing I don't like about it is if you trip one little bit the fat guy catches up to you.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|is not the best its like in the middle is ok not the best in the word but why are u reading this i havent even download it<br />wait wait ok now am going to trun it<br />and kelly cute lol
B00136JNTE|2.0|This is NOT a passable, nor bearable remaster/ rerecording of Bark of the Moon. In fact, it is strikingly botched- not amateur, INCOMPETENT! I bought this 2002 Bruce Dickinson version unaware: as I started listening, I noticed a certain magic missing. Before long I was hearing..huh?.. just...WTF?- threw off the headphones & checked the packaging. Now I collect copies of the original & 1995 22bit remaster: if you play them, side by side, track for track, you will LAUGH at the differences. In brief, Blizzard, DOAM, & BATM were issued on cd, again in 1995 (with the big color frames). Then ruined in 2002. Now, a legacy edition fixed the Blizzard & DOaM back to original (due to a critical backlash of fan's disgust) - but not BARK AT THE MOON, as i write this. So to hear that marvelous album, it takes careful scrutiny of outofprint editions. Don't be fooled- this isnt just bogusly altered like the Randy Rhoads classics, it's FAR worse. I don't know if Bruce D. did this on purpose to fuel the necessary backlash, or if he let some janitor do this whole disc while he went out for a smoke. BUYER BEWARE!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I would recommend this game for all ages. Its a great game to play especially to kill time! Download this free game and enjoy!
B004RQVVGU|5.0|Okay, I don't own this yet but what reviewer Mark Rogers says is very true: IT IS CRITICAL THAT REVIEWS for the BOGUS 2002 remaster aren't confused with the 2011 Legacy 2 disc set.<br /><br />I just wanna review the original: it is as AWESOME as ANYTHING: metal and nonmetal. After I stopped listening to metal, I still listened to Diary (in its original form) regularly and religiously. Although many Randy Rhoads fans gravitate toward Blizzard & Tribute, Diary is a cut above. It's the magickal masterpiece soundtrack to some dark castle, as much as ZOSO is to Middle Earth, or Sgt. Pepper, or OK Computer, or Exile on Main St... Plain and simple, Diary is just UP THERE. It's a really accomplished, engaging, spooky recording... & after the disgust & disgrace of the 2002 issue, $haron was forced to re-release Diary (& Blizzard) in its original form with stellar performances from bassist Bob Daisley & drummer Lee Lerslake (& keybds by John Wood, i believe.)<br /><br />Start to finish, it is PERFECT.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|I'm a grown man, no kids, and this movie gave me chills at least 3 times. Enough said on that.
B000001ELB|5.0|Ive tried to get into KISS many times since 1976. Something about them always fatigued me more than the initial excitement. Ex: KISS Alive 2 starts with a masterpiece, but it is arguable if the excitement holds up. Usually it was boring sound quality, or writing formula- particularly scanning the start of the songs. If you don't know where to start, Double Platinum is hard to beat. By this I mean:1. it has no garbage from late 80s; 2.the sound production varies interestingly song to song, & 3.it is dense with great songwriting. From this point of view, I have found no other non-live KISS product offers this better: THIS IS THE ALBUM that got me to appreciate KISS: now I SEE! NOW I BELIEVE! lots of great hard rock songs, Gene is underestimated as an interesting bassist AND vocalist. I throw this on shuffle alot- (of course this many tunes, one skips a few.) Double Platinum really thrilled me with that carefree 70's teenager vibe,(& soon I changed my diet from harder metal to discovering Thin Lizzy, Free, Starz, Sweet Humble Pie.)<br />This doesn't negate the criticisms that KISSperts level at Dbl.Plat. The songs are tinkered in ways the band didn't intend, (but the stuff they did intend isn't always golden either.) However, as a starting point for the pre-KISStified, or for skeptical non-fans to reconsider, I would vouch that Double Plat. (so far) is the widest door into the church of pure 70's KISS for the 3 reasons I listed. I would also pick this as a gift, to convert others, or as a one disc KISStimonial to show a doubter LOTS of crafty, catchy, solid rock songs that proves just how WORTHY KISS' legacy is. (a curious chunk of great tunes from LoveGun are NOT on DP however.)<br />I could argue that their first album, packed with great songs, is not recorded well enough for many first-timers (none of the reviews on Amazon yet discuss the quality of remastering so I dunno), & so on thru the catalog- some discs, like Creatures are heavier, yada yada: ...unless you are meant to enjoy their beloved live stuff first, or you are capable of enjoying the 80s glitz of LetsPuttheXinSex next to the 70s sweaty woohoo of Strutter without earcramping from aesthetic inconguity, ... I pick Double Platinum as the most interesting KISS audio product (at this time) with which to start (again, based on 1.songwriting 2. sonic variety of mixes 3.peak period 70's stuff) .. After this purchase, you can start to say out loud, \\"yeah, I like KISS\\".
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I am a big fan of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic.  You can do many things in this game like playing mini games with individual ponies to get them more stars.  The more stars they have the harder and more getting money jobs they can get.  There's a shop that sells shops, ponies and decorations for your village.  The shops will get you money. Get the elements of harmony and gather up PonyVille, that is your mission.  This is one of my favorite apps I'm sure it will be yours too.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|When auditioning for Britain's Got Talent, Susan Boyle said that she would like to sing songs from the stage and chose one for her audition song. I had hoped that she would put out a CD like this one.  She has a lovely voice as well as her own personal style in delivering these songs.
B008JFUOVI|3.0|For the viewer who, like me, reveled and rolled with laughter at the characters, surprises, spring-loaded moments of subtlety, uproars, and mad funnies of the original [[ASIN:B002RVCCUQ The Hangover]] and its sequel, [[ASIN:B004EPZ06G The Hangover Part II (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy)]], this Part III is much less than all that.  But it still is worthwhile.  The first two movies were so over-the-top, that the allusions and invocations of great memories already are worth the price of admission to The Hangover Part III.<br /><br />Alas, the plot and characters here lack the width and contrasts, and the element of surprise is pretty much gone.  But compared to all the schlocky stuff out there, this is a movie I'm glad to have spent a couple hours of my life seeing.  Once is enough, though.  And if you're not already a devotee from those first two, I would not start with this one.<br /><br />Remember how you felt after watching [[ASIN:B005DNPF7C The Godfather Part III]]?  Enough said.
B00000I0XW|5.0|Andrew Lloyd Webber and Sarah Brightman are really great together as he wrote many of these songs for her voice.

B007EECSFA|4.0|Book grabs you right away and I love books where even the secondary characters are fleshed out. The parallel storyline was a bit hard to follow at first (keep in mind I also read in bed and sometimes fall asleep and to reread what I read the night before which may account for some my confusion. I suppose it was written in that manner so that the ending would be such a shocker. And it was. Really good bool.
B0039208JE|5.0|It's been years since I saw this film so watching it on Blu-ray was a treat. Originally I thought Jack Nicholson's performance wasn't as over the top needed for his character as it should be. Seeing it now changed my opinion as he has the right amount of ham needed without chewing up the scenery. Too much of Jack being Jack would have made him unintentionally funny as he was in 'The Shining' where you knew he was already nutso the first time he cocked an eyebrow. Comparing his performance to Heath Ledger's Joker is unfair because the second version is a darker one for another time and their characters have different back stories. Actually this 1989 film is pretty dark too. Michael Keaton seems better than before as he deals with his dual nature. His sly humour is a welcome relief from Christian Bale's glumness. Villains usually have the showier parts but I now feel both characters carry equal weight and blend nicely into Tim Burton's grand vision which is the real star of this film ably supported by Anton Furst's gothic production design and Roger Pratt's sharp cinematography for the evening scenes. The rest of the cast fill out their roles nicely but Jack Palance is still wayyy over the top with exaggerated line readings that make me cringe again so maybe that's why Nicholson reined in his own performance. (Imagine a MadTV skit where these two actors try to out-ham each other....) And let's not forget the contribution of Danny Elfman's sweeping Wagner-like score that adds so much to the mood of this film which has aged well and should not be neglected for the newer version.<br /><br />Video quality is very good with clear details and color reproduction. One reviewer here has also praised it but complained about the poor surround mix. Actually the surround mix is good but there's a possible reason for his complaint. There are three English soundtracks on this disc; the third one is the Director's Commentary. The first one is Dolby Digital 5.1 where I too noticed the inferior surround sound. The second one is Dolby TrueHD and is a better distributed surround mix with more activity in the rear channels. I didn't realize this second program was available until I scrolled through the onscreen Audio menu to find the commentary. Our players default to the first audio setting on the menu (Dolby Digital 5.1) so you have to manually change to the second setting (Dolby TrueHD). Play it with this one and you'll hear the difference as it's also louder and brighter. I'm assuming the other reviewer like me wasn't aware of the TrueHD mix. It does state it on the cover but the print is tiny. I don't know why the manufacturers didn't place the better audio mix first or eliminate the inferior one. I recall my VHS tape with Dolby Surround had plenty of separation but I'm now unable to play it for comparison with the Blu-ray.<br /><br />The 'making of' extras are worth watching as well as the documentaries about the Batman legend. Prince's three music videos are over the top but that's just Prince being Prince during those years. Burton's commentary is informative but his nonstop enthusiastic chattiness became tiring and put me to sleep. Maybe that's an unfair comment so I'll have to listen to it again when I'm wide awake instead of late at night.<br /><br />5 stars for the film and video & audio quality. And for under $10 so how can you go wrong?inferior surround sound. The second one is Dolby TrueHD and is a better distributed surround mix with more activity in the rear channels.

B0044XV3QY|5.0|Lets face facts, Avatar is a standard cliche movie depicting the hero's journey from misfit to great warrior. Originality and plot aren't the strong points here. Where Avatar shines is in the breakthrough special effects that have undoubtedly been a historical turning point in the film industry for 3D and CGI technologies. The only way to facilitate the breathtaking visual and audio experience of this film is on the crystal clear 1080p quality of  Blu Ray and this set delivers what it promises!
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|Fun and entertaining game. Challenges problem solving skills. Great way to introduce early physics. Would recommend this to a young adult, too.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I'm sure that most of you reading these reviews have already seen these movies and know just how amazing they are. So the only thing I have to say is that this Blu Ray set brings out the HD quality of Nolan's Batman to the highest possible level and I have no complaints I can think of.

B003ZSJ212|3.0|As far as I'm concerned you didn't come here for reviews on the film as you probably already watched them and just want this for the collector's value. Well as far as I'm concerned it delivers exactly what it promises, the Star Wars saga with the perfect 1080p quality of blu ray. However this version is still contains the altered original trilogy. While I definitely like many of the alterations (they are more like polishes then changes to me) Han still shoots second which has cost this review a star for me (I mean seriously, what the hell?). However they also have a CGI yoda replace the puppet they used in Phantom Menace which is a win for me. Also, this isn't an extended edition and they only have some of the deleted scenes, not all of them. Overall it is lacking in bonus content so there goes another star. So I'd say it is a bare bones Star Wars Saga Blu Ray set and a bit overpriced for being what it is but it does deliver its promise.

B005XZHQKY|3.0|To my surprise of the three discs I found the one on Sharks the best with the Ocean Wonderland next. But the one on sharks covers more than just the sharks which is why it came out ahead of the other two.  I bought it for 3D effects and bit disappointed in that.  Especially the disk on Whales which just did not come across well in 3D but that may have as much to do with subject as the photography.  Some 3D scenes are ok but overall not that great.  Still, it was interesting and while repetitive in places worth adding to collection.

B004HW7JH4|5.0|yes I'm trying 2 get them all, so when I get the time, I can catch up. good tv watching.......
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I've always had a craving for playing games with cars especially if their challenging. This game meets my standards.. I love this game!
B001GCUER0|5.0|a good look back at the pass, love the ladys clothes...show how men in that time view them in that time of life.
B009Z59ZNE|5.0|Superb!  The entire cast was great but Richardson's performance was outstanding.  I would give it 10 stars if that rating was available.<br /><br />FYI, the remastered edition looks great and is closed captioned.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|It is a fun game.  The graffics are really great.<br />I am going to attempt to change some options again to tweak it if I am able.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|So captivating. I had time a hard time putting it down. I loved the characters. Thanks for a writing this book.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|Les Miserables is one of my favorite musicals.  I have seen the Broadway show. I have the 25th anniversary concert addition.  I expected very little from this performance.  I was very much surprised at the quality and performace of theis production and of the actors involved
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is addictive.  I did not think I would like this but I was wrong. I laugh everytime I flip and keep on playing.
1400069289|5.0|I loved this book from start to finish. Fascinating stories drew me in and, surprisingly, allowed me to look at the habits I have formed in my own life. This is the first self-help type book that I have been able to stomach from start to finish. Others, I've thrown aside after a few chapters because they were just too dull. I got this as a library rental, but will be purchasing it. It's a definite \\"re-read.\\"
B0066W1AZK|4.0|it is a really good game but most of the time when you are getting ready to get a checkmate it stops saying it is stalemate I also had 1 checkmate but no the game says stalemate but if you don't care about that then it will be good for you that is the only problem
B003W5C0VC|5.0|great in blu ray / much better than manhunter which was the first movie after the book / this is sooo much better
B0033AI4PM|5.0|Watching this again after a having seen the previous DVD issue I was taken back to the time that I first saw this in the cinema. The restoration work has been thoroughly and lovingly caried out. Funny Girl never looked better. Just a pity that Sony Columbia didn't manage to put on some more extras or bonus features than previously available on the other issues.....otherwise, a great buy!
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|Listen to the Piano Guys music daily.  Would recommend this to others.  Would love to have them do a cd of spiritial songs.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Get this app! Despite the price, this game is amazing. It is totally worth the seven dollars or charges you, and, compared to the computer edition, it should be worth ten dollars. Don`t get one of the million games that copy this. Get the real, genuine, MINECRAFT. Oh, and ignore the negative reviews.<br /><br />Long live Minecraft!
B001DDBCUA|5.0|I have been a fan of this show for years. I just got through with a Sex and The City marathon.It never gets old. My friends and I get together often to have lunch and talk and it always makes me think about the show.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|Enhanced the stage production and gave a grittier sense of the times and conditions.  Very well done. Best on a big screen with surround sound.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|There was nothing about this book i didn't like.  Love is very real and we have to embrace every second we have because in a blink it could be gone.
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|I happened to be channel surfing and decided to check out Orphan Black - started to watch and was immediately drawn in to the show. Stopped watching because the series was well underway and I wanted to start from episode 1. The acting is excellent, well cast and the premise is interesting - imagine running into a look alike? Before you know, you've met more than one look alike and someone is trying to kill you and your \\"twins\\" - but who and why. Loved it! Can't wait for the 1st season and hope this fine show continues.

B000B589JI|1.0|I did not open this item until after the return window had closed.  I did not think I would need to verify that it would unscrew.  The only thing that will unscrew is the top lid, the other two pieces, the cap and spout, are stuck inside the upper lid.  I've tried everything I can think of and 3 different hardware stores to try and get them out.  No dice.  I have some other water-tight containers so I'll just have to use that instead.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|its the best game ive ever played for an app. this game could be better if players can meet and some how trade things.....over all its an exelent game.
B00006JL1Z|4.0|I like this CD it has may good songs and some not as good. if you are a Fleetwood Mac fan it's worth owning.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I love how she did not give up and was not going to let Phillip and his wife get away with this crime. I would recommend this book to everyone.
B005IEGUDY|5.0|Edward Rutherford's SARUM is a remarkable book about the city of Salisbury and its surrounding environment that takes place over an amazing 10,000 years of time, from the end of the last Ice Age until the present day.<br /><br />It took me a month to read it, a long time to read a book for me. But I found it to be quite the page-turner. It had a succession of strong characters and good plot twists that kept me reading.<br /><br />The only caveat I have is that the whole premise of the novel is built on the old-fashioned view that blood runs true. So the Porteous family always has men who are stiff and socially awkward. The Shockleys include women who are strong-minded and beautiful with golden hair and blue eyes. The Forest-Wilson family consists of men who are secretive and manipulative.<br /><br />This is an excellent literary technique for keeping the characters of each generation straight in the reader's mind, BUT it is absolutely NOT true of the way things really are. What actually happens is that the genetic pool randomly selects traits for each person, randomly generating personalities, strengths and weaknesses for each generation. Of course, socio-economic status plays its rule, and sets these traits in a certain pattern. But the coming-to-be of a person is initially a random process. Which is why geniuses often seem to come from nowhere.<br /><br />I wish that the author had addressed this in an Author's Note, as the view that blood runs true has had pernicious consequences, especially in the 20th century. Five stars.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|We saw this on Showtime and couldn't wait for it to come out.  We watch this over and over, not just for the music but for the story.  Each band member has their own story and you will respect each of them for their contributions to the Eagles - warts and all.  Great Great music and story telling.  Well worth the money if you are an Eagles fan.  If you are not a fan, you will be after seeing this.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I am a fan of Ken Follett and I've enjoyed reading several of his novels, including FALL OF THE GIANTS. So I was looking forward to reading WINTER OF THE WORLD, but it didn't seem up to his usual standard.<br /><br />What struck me first was how Mr. Follett's prose is riddled with tells. Now, I have written a lot about this subject before, and readers of my previous posts know that I'm not against tells providing that they don't annoy the reader. There are two things to remember about them if you want to use them. First, it helps if they have a voice, a personality or a particular point of view. Neutral reportage doesn't do in a novel. Secondly, if you can't do that, you MUST use them SPARINGLY.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Mr. Follett's tells were of the neutral reportage variety, so the effect was to dampen down the emotion of the story, which makes the reader LESS emotionally engaged. Not what you want if you are a writer.<br /><br />But the problem with the tells masked an even deeper problem with this novel, which was the lack of characterization of the main characters. As others have remarked, the vivid personalities from the last novel take a back seat as their children take center stage. What a pity, therefore, that the children are so not interesting! Let us hope that their children, who will feature in the next novel, are as interesting as their grandparents were. Three stars.
B003TQKVGU|4.0|Somone should read this if they can believe it. This has been a proven phenomenon.<br />Good things follow you if you expect them.
0786962984|5.0|Wizards of the Coast has managed to do a pretty exceptional job packing alot of game into a very small box that fits nicely on any shelf. The artwork is fantastic and the quad fold board is quite large (although not as large as the 80s version). Retains all the gameplay of the original but with new characters and monsters. They dropped the 80s reissue mechanics of wounds and healing, and ambushing other characters.<br /><br />Now for the components. The board as mentioned is very high quality with great artwork. It isn't large enough to put the monster cards in the rooms so there are these little tokens you have to use to keep track of what monsters/treasures are where. This works pretty well although slows gameplay down somewhat and you only get 12 markers which may not be enough, although I haven't played enough to run out yet. Alot of the most important gameplay tables and information is printed right on the board so you don't have to constantly refer to the rule sheet which is a nice touch.<br /><br />The monster treasure cards are very nice although a bit on the thin side. But they're no thinner than the cards on the 70s and 80s versions of the game. For the price, you can't really expect thick card stock.<br /><br />The various tokens though are heavy thick stock and double sided so you don't have to fiddle with flipping them right side up. The character tokens are two piece interlock and are serve their purpose but I'm a bit worried that overtime they will loosen and not stay together. The included six sided dice are standard fair. The rule book isn't really a book. It's a cleverly folded single sheet of paper printed on both sides but it can be read without unfolding it like a roadmap.<br /><br />All in all a great buy for those that grew up with the originals and also a great way to introduce younger kids to the classic dungeon crawl experience.
B000FCK65W|5.0|Life has changed so much since that book was written but there were some elements that mirrored my life as I was growing up. Much of what was felt, taught and became part of Francie's life are still stages each child, especially girls, pass through and they cause much of the same angst as then.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|This program provided not only entertainment, but also a lot of historical information with which I was not familiar.  Look forward to every episode and have not been disappointted
B00B1MHA18|5.0|Music the way it should be.  these two are a unique duo and you won't be disappointed if you order this product.  Timeless
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I enjoyed watching this and highly recommend if you enjoy Bradley Cooper flicks!  Rbt. De Niro was super too!  Jennifer Lawrence was excellent!  You get my drift....  I luved it!<br />The story line touched me.  I don't want to give too much away if you haven't seen it.  When I purchased this movie I had no idea what it was about so it was a great adventure for me to experience!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Not much you can say about a game of bingo. It's OK as far as apps/games go.  Don't know that I've played it much.
B005WQ4RP6|5.0|Excellent movie. Classic DiNero. Had to put this one in my<br />Classic Collection. Everything was intense about this movie,<br />especially the scene in the auditorium classroom.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Season 8 should be more of the same but instead the episodes are fresh and new with a lot of turns and twists.  Keep watching guys.  It only gets better!
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|The book has a very dark under story that was have  to read at times. I can't believe orphanages like that ever could have existed. The stories of Jamie and Lydia were sometimes too long and drawn out. The last 100 pages were much more entertaining than the first 100.
B00BY9GQHM|2.0|Beautiful graphics, but it is just h/o scene after h/o scene. No real story to follow. Kind of boring. Might have been more interesting if you actually had to figure out how to get from place to place. Pricing matches difficulty in this case. Would be a good game for the youngsters.
B003P2WO5E|4.0|I'm not a big fan of epic fantasy, but this story was engaging and unique.  I expected a weak attempt at a fresh story, but I was impressed with the plot lines and character development.

B00BSBUZT6|4.0|I warn the US release is region locked only for US/Canada. If you're outside of Region A, you get a world map saying region mismatch. Well, this is warning for those in the UK, Europe and for Australia and NZ.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This was a good , albeit long book, with more intrigue than expected. Double - cross upon double - cross, somewhat hard to keep up with all the twists and turns.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Love how this game is so well put together and for the fact that I wanted to make my own park since the first time I seen the movie, but I would not suggest to anyone that you buy game currency because it's not fairly balanced your getting ripped off, to me anyways&hellip;<br />Overall, good game.
B004LWZW7E|5.0|Futuristic story in the future where time is currency, life and death. Justin Timberlake is one cool customer as he goes after the system and tears it up from the inside.
B0068THAGY|5.0|I loved it. Great movie especially since it had the traditional Spielberg feel. Abrams did a great job directing.<br /><br />Would love to see Abrams & Spielberg team up again.

B004LUHQ1G|5.0|I have listened to this cd countless times.. a favorite of the wife's and mine. Every song is good - no stinkers to be found. One of my favorite cd's of all time, actually.

B0047SF41G|4.0|I dig this entry in the Predators universe. Lots of fun, bad-ass action, and some good actors. I'm glad I FINALLY watched this.
B00AH8FTT2|1.0|I had read poor reviews but after how much I enjoyed the first two I still bought it. The story ended abruptly. Did the author have to go out or something. I really don't care if the story is meant to continue. I won't waste my time or money.
B00AB2NYNC|5.0|Saw a special on TV and was hooked.  Can't seem to hear enough of them now.  It actually amazes me how often I had heard them on the radio and didn't know who they were!
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|Nothing really to call home. Very mediocre action. Stupid theme. Jennifer is cute but that is about it. I saw her latest picture and she was much better in it.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|I was not very familiar with Tintin, other than knowing of his French comic-book origin. The animation style kept me wondering if I was really looking at something drawn, computer animated, or real life!
B00BWF59P8|5.0|I have been following Bea Johnson's blog for several years now, and was delighted to find her information all brought together in the one place.  I bought this as an ebook, and read it cover to cover.  I now look forward to going back over certain areas of my need.  I was especially fascinated to find how much I have taken on board over the last couple of years, that initially I had thought &#34;way too hard&#34; and now realise are part of my family's everyday life.  Especially nice to read an ebook in good, clear grammar, without endless typos!<br />I would recommend it widely - for those who wish to follow her guide, and for those who haven't previously thought about such things.

B0091TGWYE|5.0|The very best iPhone pouch I've ever bought. Materials are very good, craftsmanship was awesome. I would buy a dozen in different colors as a collection if they made them. available. Very highly recommend to anyone who likes the pouch.<br />Updated, I just bought another one, which is white. (06//13/2015)
1416955070|5.0|I purchased this book as part of an extensive classroom library.  My students created their own waiting list so they could make sure they got to read it!  They love it!!!
B000MQPKVG|5.0|I saw this film when it came out in the mid 70's<br />It was a festival of \\"meh\\". I did not understand it, (I was young.)<br />Years later I happened to catch this on a  late night showing on television and I was rapt, mesmerized. I then watched on the big screen in 70mm in a revival house and then it really hit home.<br />This is a masterpiece of direction and a masterpiece of film making. The only person that has come anywhere near this kind of filmmaking is Malik.<br />As for the performances all I can say is Ryan Oneal is hugely underrated, (look at Paper moon), watch \\"whats up Doc\\", these are journeyman master performances in comedy and pathos. The man is misunderstood and vastly underused.<br />This film is  eye candy to end eye candy. An Incredible feat.
1416972242|5.0|I purchased this book as part of my extensive classroom library and my students absolutely love it.  They even created their own waiting list to make sure everyone got to read it!
B004I2K4E8|5.0|Every performer was gifted!!!<br /><br />This is a long performance, so one should be in the right frame of mind to sit and listen some of the most gifted singers!<br /><br />This would make a wonderful Present because it Stands the Test of Time!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This is a great movie for a Friday night! The cast is great, the characters very human, and the story is smart and fast-paced. But the movie never takes itself quite seriously, which makes it a ton of fun! It's really equal parts action thriller and comedy - very dark comedy at times.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This book sucks you in right from the start.  As the plot twisted and turned, I was on the edge of my seat.  I couldn't wait to get home from work to keep reading.  A thoroughly readable and believable story.  Awesome.
B0027Z2T8C|5.0|This is one of the most original and fun movies I've ever seen! It's equal parts kung-fu, fantasy, and comedy, and it does all of them in great style.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|When prompted by Google Play, I updated the Kindle app I had been using on my Galaxy Note phone.  That version of update 4.0.2.1 was buggy. Again and again, after reading a book for a long time, I would be unable to get out of the book and back to the app's Home screen. I could use the phone, work with other apps, and when I opened the Kindle app, I was stuck in the same book. Killing the application didn't work. I had to uninstall/reinstall, which truncated my bookmarks to one word.<br /><br />I decided to get the Kindle app for Android directly from Amazon. I also started returning to the Carousel/Home every time I was going to stop reading for awhile. Whatever. This app has worked flawlessly for weeks.<br /><br />UPDATE: Enthused too soon. 5 days after the original review, I'm stuck in one book again. Guess I go back to the old Kindle Keyboard until THEY patch this one or maybe I can find a copy of the older version of the app. Lowered my opinion and my rating.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|This book reads easily and quickly. You are drawn in to a world foreign to most of us and given insights on how things in Iraq and, by extension, Afghanistan. Wonder why we are there or if we did a good job, read this book.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It could be longer but it is fantastic. Unbelievable graphics and I was genuinely stuck at times but it was a great time overall.
B008BDZP3K|5.0|This is for the latest remaster of Hot Rats. It's the first remaster of Zappa's stuff that I bought based on the review of DVERADA's \\"Box Of Sound\\" review of the new Zappa remaster series. I have the older CD release on gold disc that my friend Bill (DVerada) had provided for me back in the day. I never thought I'd be a fan of Zappa's non \\"vocal\\" stuff, but this album changed my idea of Frank Zappa music.<br /><br />So, I don't want to say this is a better recording than the earlier CD copies, because they are good. What is different is, these are ORIGINAL. I mean every song sounds like you're sitting in the studio during the recording of these tracks. Every instrument comes to life and all of it sounds like true to original late 60's sound. \\"Peaches En Regalia\\" leaps out at you. \\"Willie The Pimp\\" sounds like Captain Beefheart is singing the vocals in the next room.<br /><br />If you want to hear as close to what the original vinyl must of sounded like, this release will do it. Zappa in his 1969 jazziest. True 5 stars way up for me.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|I think this game is for a younger gamer who still has good hands and wrists.  There is a section in the game that you must select the little tiles extremely quickly.  I have carpal tunnel and almost did not make it through this segment and there was no place to pause this segment.  Otherwise, the game keeps calling me back to play it because it is fun.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I recommend this game to anyone who loves sea animals (or eating them)<br />I would love it if they added multiplayer.
B00ATSBIIG|3.0|The pictures that you have to complete are beautiful.  Wish I could obtain some of them for my walls.  But after you do a few of these pictures, it gets boring.  The same thing over and over.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Once I started I just kept reading  it was st a lively pace that kept you moving.  It didn't spend too much time at any one place.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I absolutely love this game.  I play it twice a day so I can get the maximum coins every day to play with plus the bonus.  Love it, love it, love it!  It is just like back at the County Fair when I used to look at this game and just wish I could play it, but we didn't have the money, so no go.  Now, I can play to my hearts content and let the excitement build as I try to get the prizes and bigger coins to further my rewards.  Everyone should get this game!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|If you liked Gosford Park, then you will love this series.  The quiet humor, the heart, and the relationships of the series are heartwarming and will draw you in immediately.  I guarantee that when you finish season 1, you will be eagerly looking forward to getting the next seasons!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I really like this game, it is more like Boggle is but has a few point increases possible.  But I wish I could also play this by myself for a while to get to know how it is played.  I hate to get onto the game on Facebook and ask the opponent, who is a real-life person, tell me how do you play this game?  I haven't found the Help Screen yet and I don't know anything about it as yet.  Made me feel silly.  But that is the only thing I found that I didn't like.  Otherwise, it is a very fun game.
B005HSL626|4.0|Just like the regular game, only free!  There's not a lot more to be said about it other than a fun game.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I always used to have a problem getting You Tube to download for me.  I never could seem to get it to do that, so I never got onto You Tube even though I had an account there, All I have to do now is click on it and Voila!  It opens right up for me.  Love that very much.  If anyone is a bit of a silly-willy at some of these apps like I am, this is just the ticket for you to get onto You Tube right away.  I definitely recommend this app,
B0041OT9W6|5.0|I think this book is for family because most people would enjoy it from reading it. I recommend this book
0061950726|1.0|The subject of the story is very interesting but the book seems rushed and thin.  Also there is an unnecessarily graphic description of the attempted rape of a ten year old girl. Not sure why that had to be included to get across the idea of what happened to some children.<br />Just wish the author took more time to develop a longer storyline.
B004SN8YXK|5.0|Love the shoe this is my second pair. All do i have not worn them because i sent them home, i used my last pair for 9 months of my deployment work out so good for me i had a pair sent home. Also had no problem with the shipment the seller keep his end of the bargin as professional as they could be thanks.
B001O1O71C|5.0|Surprising? I did not expect to be so engrossed in the story. Of course, the ending will shock you. Totally unexpected
B005MHI0QM|4.0|I downloaded this book to read before visiting the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam. You must remember this is a diary not a novel, but it is a very enlightening account of a teenage girl during this time in history. It is a must read for any history buff and anyone visiting the Anne Frank House.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Like it but wanted more, ended too abruptly. Sookie's character seemed watered down. Almost as if the vampire adventure never happened.
B003O86FMW|5.0|But I thoroughly enjoyed this book which oddly tells of a world not so unlike ours. Written for youths I only agreed to read the book so I would know what the hell my nephew was talking about. Now I can't wait to see what happens next and how the story ends.
B00CATSONE|5.0|The book was very easy to read. It was a light read but very detailed and clear. Once I began reading I did not stop until I finished the whole book. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Best book I ever read. Once I started I couldn't stop. I would recommend this book to anyone who asked me about it.

B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Silver Linings Playbook is a 2012 Romantic Comedy directed by David O. Russell.  Starring Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, (along with a sensational supporting cast), it's a story of mental illnesses and improbable love.  I thought it was beautiful.<br /><br />This was my first experience with Jennifer Lawrence and I her performance here was incredible.  Brooding and explosive, she was an ambient, unmitigated element who somehow also brought real humor to the film - I was blown away by that.  And Bradley Cooper was similarly effective.  Stack on Robert De Niro, Jacki Weaver, and Chris Tucker, (Tucker nailed it), and it's a win across the board.  I'm so pleased I opted to sit this through.<br /><br />Silver Linings is quirky and it's moving.  I laughed often.  I think there's also some tragedy in what's offered here and that's valuable.  I've suffered through too many relationship comedies and it's about time someone broke the mold and started taking the genre seriously.  It's not that I've ever been opposed to them, it's just been so rare to land on any with real substance.  But there is most certainly substance here and it's instilled some faith in me.  The next time I'm walking the rental wall at my local movie store, you can bet I'll slow down for the films I used to run past.  I've been reborn and my wife will likely be very happy about that...<br /><br />If I had one complaint, however, it would be the blatant adverts purchased by Apple.  The ipod situations, (and there were a few), were distractingly tacky and did some damage.  At least in my opinion they did.  A woman mocking people for not owning the product, plugging the product into a futuristic wall dock, the product being gifted, the giftee gushing over THAT, videos watched on the product, the product being danced too, etc..  No thank you.<br /><br />But I do recommend the film and do so highly.  ipods aside, it's pretty great and absolutely worth what they're asking.<br /><br />Thank you for your time.<br /><br />- time.<br /><br />- t

B008K7RGA2|5.0|Gheorghiu has matured since La Triviata, Kaufmann's voice is magnificently controlled, intelligent acting ability -- I wait for more of his leading rolls on DVDs -- and Terfel is disgustingly successful in the Scarpia roll down to  the flutter of an eye lash.  .
B009DJB8I2|5.0|This is a must have for any major portal fan! It also comes with a FREE copy of Dota 2 and a free item in team fortress 2!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|The characters in the book are very well developed.  Not much has been written about foster care and what the lives of those who go through that system face in life.  Not only was this book very illuminating, it was also uplifting.  The characters were not magically changed.  There emotional flaws were always evident, as well as their mental and emotional struggles.  Although this is not a &#34;happily ever after&#34; book, it was truly uplifting.  As a pediatrician I have always appreciated that parents do the best they can for their children, even though often it is far from enough.  This is a beautiful reminder of the fact that however flawed we are as human beings, we are at our best when we are trying to give our children better lives than we've had.
B000U6BT40|4.0|I really need my daily dose of Syfy. This is good stuff. I especially like the deadpan humor of the sheriff
B005K17RU0|5.0|Wow, couldn't be happier.  Got us through the current storm cells with better knowledge of what was happening. Much easier to use and better than weather bug!
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Except for one part,I loved this movie! And the 3D was cool. This not pop out 3D, not really. It is more see the landscape and things yu cannot really find well in 2D. Thats the thing with 3D leaving people disappointed, I assume. I one of my other favoritae filsm in 3D and I saw more than ever. It was pretty cool.3D is intriguing.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This is a must read book. It is hilarious. I love that it was from a man's point of view I wish more authors did this. Cant wait to read more from this author.
B004W4N55C|2.0|The app is completely unusable for me on 4.2.2. It crashes whenever I attempt to type. On other devices, it doesn't crash but requires me to sign into Amazon constantly. It provides no cloud functionality and has no way of sharing favorite tabs across devices. When the app works, it's not much better than using the website for viewing tabs.
B008XX6J4C|3.0|The talent of these guys is indescribable.  However, the musical selections of this group did not always appeal to my musical ear.
159463176X|3.0|I was so excited to read this long awaited novel,  It started with such promise with the first story about a brother and sister who are separated through tragic circumstance.  However, the more I read the less connection I had to the multiple characters. I beleive there were entire sections of this book that could have been omitted thar would have helped it flow much better. Specifically the section where the bad guys builds the enormous house in the small town of their youth. I am sure that it has some political significance, but it did not seem to really fit.<br /><br />Overall, it was a book with great promise that fell short due to way too many characters through too many decades. It jumped all over the place. I had to flip back several times just to figure out who he was talking about. Maybe, I just had too high of expectations, but it was a disappointment to me from someone who wrote one of the most compelling books I have ever read, The Kite Runner. I thoroughly enjoyed his second novel too.
B006L9B6TI|4.0|I found the whole concept interesting and logical too.  The book was recommended to me and I, in turn have recommended it.
B002BJGYU8|5.0|Don't know how in the world I missed this show while it was on tv.  Someone told me to try it, and I was completely hooked.  I LOVE this show!  So funny, smart, sweet and sincere.  I'll be watching and re-watching this show for years!
0805083367|5.0|We have the other books to this set and my kids just love them. Had to finish off the set when I saw this. My daughter was so happy to get this for her birthday and wants to read it all the time.
B000JBWWQ0|3.0|This is rated as a classic metaphysical novel but the movie was too sketchy.  This is a poor representation of the book
B001KZG99A|5.0|The Marvel Comics franchise continues to deliver Great movies, like this one.  Great casting and special effects, a true pleasure to watch!
B0027MJU00|5.0|I really loved this book and I was sad when it ended because I wanted to keep reading.  I loved Gone Girl, too.  Sharp Objects is my least favorite of the three books I've read by this author.  All of her characters are flawed people and it's sometimes hard to empathize or sympathize with them but the storytelling is topnotch.  I liked Dark Places so much I wish she'd write a sequel so I can find out what's going on with these people.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|The Marvel Comics franchise continues to deliver Great movies, like this one.  Great casting and special effects, a true pleasure to watch!
B00BURWSG6|5.0|If you like sound of the mid years of Stratovarius then you'll find yourself at home with Avalon.  The album does really well at integrating contrasting vocal styles and the guitar solos never seem out of place.  It took a couple of playthroughs to hook me but now I'm sold.  I hope this is just the beginning for Tolkki's Avalon.
6305428352|5.0|With tears of happiness running down my face, I stood up and cheered this movie as it ended in the theater.  All film students should be required to watch this movie as part of their education, because this is how to put a spectacular ending on a movie!  This should be in every movie lover's collection.
B000SEI230|5.0|a very emotional book. Sparks at his best!!!!!  recomended reading.  have read everything he has written.  best of all his books
B0034G4P80|5.0|The Marvel Comics franchise continues to deliver Great movies, like this one.  Great casting and special effects, a true pleasure to watch!
B0040I09RM|5.0|Amazing show all around would recomend to any person looking for a new show to watch. Writing is great and so are the actors

B003TTMFCK|5.0|Awesome cliff hanger, best one so far! One of the better seasons I've watched and I'm working my way through all of them .
B000062XGB|5.0|This is our second copy of this movie. It is a moving, classic love story that all should see. Give it a try with an open mind. We love it!
B004P2HMNM|5.0|It is expensive set for sure. All the parts are tiny and easy too loose. But kids love it. It has 2 buildings in there.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It kept my interested all through the book.  But not really surprised by the endings.
B00B2YH7BS|5.0|This is an awesome documentary of &#34;the mixing board of dreams&#34; & the studio that had the vision to buy & use it!
B004EFYZ1C|1.0|Could not open this. I tried to open this but was unable. Even had my daughter and son try and they couldn't open it either. Got it the same time I downloaded moon hd
1609611543|1.0|Not what I expected it to be.  Not helpful for eating out etc... Decided not to buy the other Wheat Belly<br />book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use and very handy. Keeps me from trying to find my desk top calculator. Glad I purchased it.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Video would not stop loading the whole time. Didn't get to watch it. Not sure if it was amazon server messing up that night or what.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use, no unwanted frills. I use the app often and love it.  If you are looking for trig functions or graphing, get something more specialized.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Easy to use and I've tried a few.  BEST one I've found.  Just did the upgrade and it's a lot different so I will have to learn how. to use it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The game was very interesting. Easy game play, great graphics, and decent story.  If anything it was too short  Worth the buy and the time.
1934030597|3.0|I didn't know anything about bike mechanics. If ur a begginer this is a great book to learn some of the basics. If u already know most of the basics then it's not as good, but it does have great explanations and exploded graphics
B00003CXRM|5.0|Great fun to watch. I highly recommend it. It is the kind of movie that brings out the best in the actors performing abilities.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I just want to say first that I REALLY wanted to love this book. It sounded amazing! But, I knew there were problems when I was more than 100 pages in and I still couldn't get into it book. The characters were predictable. Clary, she's the shy good girl who has NO IDEA that she was this shadow hunter and now everything depends on her(Harry Potter anyone)? Jace is the anti hero who is stubborn, aloof and hot. Of courses that would make him the love interested to Clary (Edward Cullen anyone)? Then we have Simon the best friend of Clary who sounds like he came from a Joss Whedon TV series. He of course is in love with Clary (Jacob Black anyone?) There is a twist in the books, that is only there to separate Jace and Clary. I don't for a second believe that it's true. It's something to push her towards Simon. Now that I talked about the characters, lets talk about the book. There are a lot of battles in this book. Way to many battles. The battles were also boring. Her world building could have also used some work. Then we come to the ending. It was Star wars meets Harry Potter 6 meets New Moon. Siblings are coming out of the woodwork, mentors aren't who they say they are, the villain is claiming teens as his children, werewolves are running around...it was a mess!<br /><br />The Good. Yes, there was some good. I thought the Alec character wasn't predictable. He was interesting and I never saw the character going that direction. The start of the book was also pretty good and so was the general question of the whole series, What does Clary know?
B002NPY7E0|5.0|bought this for a friend he really enjoys this movie.  would recommend this for the price very reasonable. Thank you
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love this app. It has so many different sounds, and you can even combine sounds. Each sound is volume controlled, so if you want a river, with crickets in the background, you can not only have that, but you can adjust the volume of each individually for just the mix you want.
B000Q8QH0I|4.0|bought this for a friend he really enjoys this movie cant beat the price for the product. great movie to see.
1904633005|5.0|I had the chance to visit Bath, England, where so many of Jane Austen's novels have at least some action. I bought an excellent hardcover copy of 'Persuasion' there. When I got back home, I decided I needed the other three of my favorites ('Pride and Prejudice', 'Sense and Sensibility, and  'Emma') in these beautiful little editions. I was delighted to find that I did not have to order them from England;  I could get them right here on Amazon! They are beautifully done, and somehow just fit the style and elegance of Austen's time. I can just imagine her with some small book just like this one. They are truly a treasure for a Jane Austen fan like me.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is a great story told from every point of view.  I can't wait to start the next part of the story.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This is my favorite game on the kindle, the only thing I don't like is that you can't create your own character but it does not matter because its amazing and It's free. Takes a lot of space but all gameloft games do.
B0087ITBPC|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie--especially with Barbra Streisand in it.  She makes a perfect Jewish mother with her hilarious actions.  During some parts of the movie trip, it was going a little slow.  The ending of the movie was emotional for me with the close bonding of mother and son.  Amazon, thank you for the on-time speedy delivery.
0156421178|5.0|Great book.  Orwell paints a great picture of life in the front lines during the war.  Based on eyewitness account, gives a moving<br />picture of life in Spain during the war from an outsider's point of view.
B005LAII12|3.0|On reviewing the DVD, I was somewhat surprised at the language that came out of the bear's mouth.  I wished the movie could of been more funnier.  I did liked the ending of the movie.  Thank you Amazon for the speedy delivery of this DVD; right on time.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|I'm speaking for my granddaughter... She loved it. Was pleased with Nana. I've never seen it but will take her word for it.
B00B8WXG9G|2.0|I guess I didn't expect such &#34;different&#34; music. I thought there would be more of Mr. Anka's &#34;genre&#34;, but on this CD he's picked up the type of music that each of the duet partners are known for. It wasn't at all what I expected. There are probably only 2 or 3 songs that we enjoyed.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|After a ten-year break, Bowie is back with a smashing, hard-rocking album that I've been waiting for. Each track is like a gem from heaven. I could not be happier with it!
B00AEJM6H2|2.0|get used to that. because if you play past level 50 in arcade mode you either see it a lot or pray for it a lot. ridiculous layout in most higher levels.frustrating to have lightning and bombs you cant use. no moves and guess what...board resets and you lose them all! classic and mineral modes pretty fun tho
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I've actually gotten to season 3 already, and I have to say, simply the best show I've ever watched. It even tops Warehouse 13. I personally think that that doctor from the first season is the best one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game, it is very addictive, once you get caught u just need to go again to try and get a higher score. It's a fun game to get, with one minor disapproval, the fact that you have to get exceedingly high amounts of one thing to receive something or someone .e.g. you need 500 spaceships from the mystery boxes to to be able to receive Yutani. Subway Surfers has outdone Temple Run.!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great app very fun my 2 year-old really enjoys playing with her horse she will play for hours on end at a time
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I would request it to people,for sure.  It's amazing for homework in the 7th grade.  It helps when in gifted math.
B002ZG977Y|4.0|I didn't really want to see this movie cause it is a remake, but was impressed when we watched it was way better then the original
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|It is so fun every one buy it my little sisters even like it so if I was u buy it now don't hesitate  do it
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Let me state right off that as a Star Trek fan since the night it premiered on NBC, I loved this film.  I saw it the day it opened and again last week at the best Imax theater in Manhattan and I think it is terrific, even better than the first film.  The actors are all superb especially Pine, Quinto, Cumberbatch and Bruce Greenwood as Admiral Pike.  The film is loaded with action.  I remember thinking that it was a very long film, not because I was bored but because every time you think it is over, we get another terrific action sequence.  The 3D was also excellent, way better than Iron Man 3.  I look forward to getting it on blu-ray and I cannot truly state that I won't see it one more time in the movies.<br />However I am so tired of the nit-pickers and complainers that I have run into about this film.  One person stated that there were no surprises.  Well yeah if you are the internet 20 hours a day reading every rumor and bit of information or downloading the film before it opened in the U.S., then I guess there wouldn't be any surprises.  I stayed away from all these rumors, as I usually do, and I found many surprises in this film.  One thing I didn't expect literally made me jump forward in my seat (no, not Khan.)  I've heard other complaints that this and that didn't make sense.  Hey guys wake up, its a movie and its a sci-fi movie.  Just sit back and enjoy it.<br />In case you haven't figured it out, I thought this movie was great and look forward to another one a few years from now.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I haven't got this game but I would give it a five star. It sucks that it is not free 6.99 that is lame make it free now
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Thank you.  I am new to Kindle publishing and needed a resource on formatting.  Who better to tell me than KDP themselves.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I thought it would be like real YouTube but it is not it's not fare that apple devices have real YouTube and this app sucks you have to look for the video that you want to watch I would give it 0 stars
B000063DGC|4.0|Classic sound from a classice duo. Great! I reccomend for any rock music lover. Just wish it was a dvd / blu ray so I could watch them perform these as well.
B005CRQ3NY|3.0|It was awesome<br />It's cool<br />Best book ever<br />Funny<br />Excellent<br />Super<br />Amazing<br />Fun<br />Mysterious<br />Wimpy<br />Put more funny in<br />Specalur
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|This is one of my favourite soundtracks ever. Love the songs and clips. If you loved the movie, and even if you didn't, this is one to own.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|What can I say?  I am definitely a &#34;Les Miserables&#34; junkie!  I have seen the stage version of this MANY times, and was thrilled when they decided to finally make a movie version of the musical.  The scenery is wonderful.  The actors and actresses are perfect choices for their roles.  And wonderful voices!!  I had NO idea that Russell Crowe could sing like that!  Wow!!
B000ICZCZS|5.0|Everyone told me about it, and I just never got around to it. Really, really enjoyed. Great acting by everyone. The kid, Nicholas Hoult, really shine. Great dialogue, story. Honestly, an awesome film with some gems you'll carry with you for ever.
B000J2BRQU|1.0|I decided to watch some of the f&f movies wondering what I missed. Apparently nothing. What a boring movie_-not even good Tokyo shots.
B002LVUKIS|1.0|Couldn't play it even in compatiability mode. Kept crashing enve with all the patches downloaded. The 3rd game worked fine but not getting to play the first two was very disappointing
B00992CF6W|4.0|Awsome but when is update 0.6.2 coming out<br /><br />Anyway it's awsome bobs.<br />Please watch my videos I will make a second episode.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|An epic laced with the densely rich culture and experiences and history of so many aspects of India and it's people.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|I really don't know what to say about this one.... except that I was disappointed.<br /><br />I felt like when I fight with my wife.... just goes round and round, and I couldn't wait till it was over.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great way to track usage. Easy to follow. Would recommend this app to anyone who needs to keep track of usage.
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|From the title I was expecting some exotic animals, werewolves, vampires or something like that...<br /><br />All this is, is a movie of a dysfunctional family and 2 lustful teenagers.<br /><br />Very bad acting, boring, almost made me cry (because it was so bad).
B007VUCAVO|5.0|My Kindle Fire HD doesnt have the charging green light....so this app is great to gadge how much battery I have.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Im just curious that i didnt gwt the update yet and i really want it! Can anyone help with info ???
B0068MNO4S|4.0|Fantastic movie! Explored the idea that Shakespeare was a fraud, and simply took credit for the work of a nobleman who could not present the writings as his own due to his position This movie WILL have you questioning it as well....The cast is excellent, the acting is great, and the sets are breathtaking... After getting into a discussion with my  college writing professor (who has written and published at least two books on Shakespeare) about the movie, he assures me that this particular story is inaccurate due to ages of some of the characters featured in the movie. Whether or not this story is true, it merely presents the viewer with the idea that someone else is responsible for the works that we've come to know and appreciate, which I personally believe may be true - History is recorded by individuals, not by the events themselves... Watch this movie!!
B00C061I3K|1.0|People actually buy and listen to this? Someone please enlighten me why they enjoy this. I tried some \\"samples\\" and couldn't stop them fast enough.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Nice to get the dog's-eye view as this story unfolds. Made me wonder what else we humans are missing as we go through life.
B000I9YWZ2|5.0|Not only are the acting performances amazing in the movie, but the singing performances are equally brilliant!  I had to add this to my collection due to my love of the story of the redemption of Johnny Cash!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I know you agree. Best<br />game ever I give it a 5 stars. If you agree that is the best.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Totally love the first season of Game of Thrones!  I thought it kept too the book and thought the characters were spot on!  Can't wait to watch the second season!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I own all of Rush's albums and listen to them all the time.  If you like &#34;theme albums&#34; and/or Steampunk then this CD is for you!  I have found it to be some of their best music that they have put out in a long time.  Neil Peart has even published a book that tells the full story!
B001JIFYSA|5.0|She apparently had seen this movie when it first came out and loved it.  She's now at a point in her life where she wanted to reach back and enjoy something from her past, so this added to her collection was a great birthday gift.. Thanks Amazon for offering it..
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Runs pretty smooth on my kindle. Updates seem to take a while though. Takes a while when a new slots or room opens up.
B00C7NKPPS|1.0|Sorry, but this remastering doesn't impress me at all. I hardly hear the difference with my old cd-copy. Furthermore the booklet has been stripped. This is not what I was waiting for all those years.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|Liked the story line and the movement of the focus to the next generation without leaving Harry and Giles out of the story
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book. Once I started reading it I was unable to put it down! It is a great love story and I reccomend it to anyone who enjoys romances with a little edge!<br />Can't wait to read walking disaster.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|My child is not worried about monsters at all because of this book he lays down at night like he never knew about monsters
B003G4W49C|5.0|I loved this book and cant wait for the movie. I could not stop reading!!! I finished the book in three days. It is totally worth five bucks.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|The show is full of surprises, which keeps me entertained. I remember watching an episode on tv and I enjoyed it so much, I had to buy the series on DVD.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|Steven Soderbergh returns to directing not long after directing magic mike..... but does this movie deliver the hype Ive been hearing? yes. Side effects is about a wife that get's prescribed anti depressants after trying to kill her self...... shortly after side effects start to come into play. while i cant say much without spoiling the movie, this movie is great and thrilling. but inst for people that don't like movies with no action....as one would expect there inst any.<br /><br />please leave feedback to tell me how i can improve reviewing things! its greatly appreciated!
0064431622|5.0|I have recently bought 5 Eric Carle books from Amazon.  When I was teaching I owned all these books,  but am repurchasimg them now for my grandchildren.  All books are well-priced and delivery is fast!  This particular book is great for teaching about colors, rainbows, and animals...and children like to turn the pages and laugh at the pictures!
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Once I started this book, it was almost impossible to put it down. The further journey and trials of Ender wrapped around the story of the beings of Lusitania was riveting .
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game!!! It's really fun and a time waisted. And it can be a little challenging at times.. but really fun.
B00CGP0D1S|4.0|Very Clear and a very nice movie. 5 stars rated from me. Sound and picture impressive. good for collection. Thanks
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Im a Avatar (blue people) fan. The visuals are amazing and beautiful, I love the behind the scenes. However I wish there was not a 3 disc collection. I only wanted the 3d blu ray disc but it fine. Concept is awesome, Acting is amazing,Visuals is breathe taking.
B008QPCCQQ|3.0|In an age when children aren't taught to read books or even write complete sentences, I find the errors<br />in this copy of Louisa May Alcott's Little Women and Little Men to be unforgivable. I don't think<br />that the author was the one in  error. I suspect that poor proofreading is to blame. This is un-<br />excusable to me. I am enjoying reading her books, but I find this very distracting.
B00AQA94M4|2.0|This has to be the worst avantasia cd to date. Is Tobias losing his touch? Let's just say there is not one song on here that is memorable. I have every avantasia cd, and this is by far the weakest. I was so looking forward to this cd, but its already out of my rotation. Oh'well I just hope Jon Oliva's upcoming cd will make up the disappointment of dude in time!!!!
B0036G8IQS|4.0|Good book. The writing was clear and the story was better than the movie version. I cant wait to read the next book in the series.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is EPIC, AWESOME, and COOL!!!!!!!!!!!!  The game is perfect if you are bored and it is also good because you can put it on peaceful mode so there are no monsters.  BUT, sometimes it glitches and I have to go and open it again.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is one of the best keyboards available for Android.  I wish there were more skins but everything else is so good,  you still get 5 stars.  Good Job devs
B00AYDC3CG|4.0|The kids really liked this. I did too. I'd say it's something you'd like to see. It's a cute take on the old Frankenstein story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it is fun to watch a person on the game and doing it is fun and doing it for a regular contributor basis
B005LAIGTG|5.0|I wanted to see this movie from the time I saw it advertised! Once I did we bought it . I felt so many different emotions we are fans of both the actor and actress this movie is well worth the money we paid for it.
B00000G3AZ|2.0|Not a bad staging of the Austen classic but Gwyneth Paltrow who is, unfortunately, in every scene is just not believable as a British country girl, terrible accent, or a good friend, too condescending. Once she gets your teeth on edge it's hard to enjoy the story or even the excellent work of Toni Collette and Jeremy Northam. Give this version a pass.
B002TZ3FE2|5.0|A fascinating and at times painful journey into the nature of trauma, memory, and what makes us what we are. This book unlocked a number of memories for me and further shaped my perspective.<br /><br />It is a big book, but necessarily so, and it doesn't feel so much like a long read as a companion. I was disappointed it had to come to an end.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this game okay it all day long I hope I revive me 2500000 points for this it will be sad if its not
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book was totally fun, very much enjoyed seeing it all from the male point of view.  Totally worth paying for.  Loved how he talked to the reader, and all the metaphors he pulled off.  He was a storyteller himself, lol.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest-there is always something new & helpful! Updates I get on my e-mails to try out & follow are always great
B007URVZJ6|5.0|The book provides very pointed answers for any writer who wants to update book in kindle step by step, and removes the mystery. Recommend for present and future writers and publishers.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Yep, it's that good. Written from the man's POV, this book is funny, smoking hot, and a breath of fresh air. Loved Drew, loved Kate, adored MacKenzie. There are so many quotable, hilarious passages I honestly would have spent my entire time highlighting them, except I didn't want to tear away from my reading. LOVED IT!!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The story kept moving with a constant stream of furious page-turning to find out what happens next. It had love, humor, and plenty of action. The characters were perfect and the detailed descriptions made the story come alive.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Again good reading but tried hard to copy Fifty Shades Of Gray!!! did not come close to it.<br />Hope her 3rd book will be much better & not a copy of 50 shades!!!!
B000050WZY|2.0|They did some digital processing to this album, which is sacrilege to analog lovers. The sound is better than CD's, but, I still feel like the \\"headroom,\\" and highs have been affected. Buy used, non digital LP's if you can find, because \\"sound matters.\\" ADDENDUM: In 2014, Apple/EMI issued Mono Masters that are not digitized in any way. I bought them all and I am extremely satisfied with the all analog sound.
B00846REIS|3.0|Sorry to say this, but this was a poor copy (or want to be) of Fifty Shades Of Grey!!!  but will recomend to my friend that like books like this.
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|Disney, I will not be buying your Blu-Ray only.<br /><br />Do you think we are so stupid to your statement \\"We are trying to give the customer what they want\\".<br /><br />***Take this as a NO VOTE to your greed.***
B0045INTVA|5.0|Fantastic movie! I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. Like most Vietnam war movies, it does sort of paint a bad picture of American troops, which irks me a bit, but I loved it
B009LMTDL0|3.0|While I enjoyed the stories in the book, I was disappointed in the lack of applicable lessons learned and paths made clear.  I found it ironic that the cornerstone of value that women create includes benefit that accrues to the community and not the woman alone.  For Susan the journey is highly personal.  I did not feel that her experience was relevant to me.. I respect her achievement and was glad that I read her book.  Perhaps I expected too much.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|The Star Wars saga on blu-ray exceeded all of my expectations that I had going in. The picture quality is amazing and the DTS-HD master audio tracks gave my home theater a real workout with the absolutely incredible sound mix. This Star Wars release like the few recent others that have come before has an altered version of the original movies. George Lucas always wants to update the Star Wars films with new ideas that he has and whenever he does this there is a very loud outcry from Star Wars fans. Although I would have liked to see the unedited versions of the films included, I'm not ever going to complain that they aren't because the Blu-Ray quality here is beyond amazing, and I really don't mind the changes all that much.  A quick rundown of my opinions of the films:  - EPISODE I: THE PHANTOM MENACE (5/5)  My favorite of the prequels by far (I know I am in the minority here). To me, this movie has the closest feel to the Original Trilogy that Eps. II and III just don't seem to have. Liam Neeson does a really great job in this movie like he does in all of his other movies, and the rest of the cast is great too. The story is a lot of fun as well but the highlights of this movie though are the pod race and the final lightsaber battle at the end with Darth Maul. Darth Maul left such a great impression on me that I think he might even take the place of Darth Vader as my favorite Star Wars character of all-time.  - EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES (4/5)  My least favorite movie of the entire saga would have to be Episode II. The main problem I have with it is the complete over-use of CGI. Many parts of the movie look pretty fake. The movie itself is also pretty slow as it does have a pretty badly written love story intertwined in the middle of the movie, but I guess it had to be there. It does have some pretty great action sequences though, and veteran actor Christopher Lee is in the movie who is always a great bad guy. And I still like the movie because it is Star Wars.  - EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH (5/5)  This movie is a pretty vast improvement over Episode II. The story here is quite a lot better but it still unfortunately uses a lot of CGI. There is a return of Darth Vader at the end of the movie, but I wish they would have had him in the suit for a longer portion than just the last couple of minutes. I believe Ian McDiarmid really steals the movie though as Palpatine. It really reminded me of Return of the Jedi during some of his scenes.  - EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE (5/5)  Everyone on the planet has probably seen this movie because it is truly an absolute classic. Its possibly the greatest movie of all-time.  - EPISODE V: THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (5/5)  And this is possibly the greatest sequel of all-time!  - EPISODE VI: RETURN OF THE JEDI (5/5)  It is really hard to make a trilogy end greatly. Return of the Jedi is the best part 3 of any trilogy I can think of.   If you are on the fence about picking up the Blu-Ray don't be. Its absolutely awesome. The packaging itself is even awesome. It comes in a little book with special art for each movie. Also there are 3 discs of bonus features with tons of deleted scenes that have not been on any release before this! You don't get the bonus features if you buy either of the two separate trilogy three-packs, so buy the complete saga 9 disc set. Its so worth it!
0811870413|3.0|If you filing pages back and forth for direction buy this book other then that I love this book.  Drives me crazy going back and forth
B00AE2LJVS|2.0|This movie had so much potential - interesting storyline, good actors - but it was the character relationships weren't developed enough in some instances. In others, it was just sad. And the hillybilly accents were so strong, you couldn't hear/understand most of the dialogue. I wouldn't pay the $4.99 to rent.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Seems to be working very well thus far. I can't complain. my kindle has been great and the book looks awesome on it.
B00AECDDYY|5.0|This is a great game there is no way to describe it it is exhilarating i recommend this game perfect
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Seems to be working very well thus far. I can't complain. my kindle has been great and the game looks great on it.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|My bff suggested the book, I shrugged it off for almost two years. Big mistake! I never wanted to put it down. It is one of those books that has twists and turns in every chapter! The detail for each character allows you to not only visualize them physically, but also to understand and accept them as human too, effected by their upbringing and everything else in their world. I am immediately purchasing the next book and I do recommend it to everyone!
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Their music catalog stands on it's own ... superbly crafted country rock / rock ... with outstanding musicianship ... it is no coincidence that their &#34;Greatest Hits Vol. #1&#34; album is the top selling album of all-time !!<br />  This biography DVD set was long overdue ... and is finely  crafted, pulling no punches and holding little back. It provides tremendous insight into  the dynamics within the band over the years ...  and does little to diminish the perception that  Henley & Frey have maintained a degree of ruthlessness over the years that has elevated the band to what could be termed &#34;juggernaut status&#34; !!<br />  While their last album &#34;Long Road Out of Eden&#34; was a clunker in comparison to the rest of their catalog ... this DVD set does not miss the mark ... and should be obtained by anyone who truly loves their music. The inclusion of a bonus DVD of a '77 live performance in Landover, MD is an added treat ... showing the group at their 'live' peak ...
B007TKT2SK|4.0|the kids enjoy my kindle while learning fractions.Amazon works hard at finding these great apps.<br />It helps me to teach them too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game to pass the time with! So addictive. I like the version on my phone better because the locations change.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|I believe souls are permanent and come back time after time. So... I really wanted to love this movie. After 60 minutes we became really bored. This is a spiritual film made by not so spiritual people.
B005BGBPBG|3.0|***SPOILER ALERT***<br /><br />Very similar to the movie '27 Dresses' with Katherine Heigl. Two best friends (or 'sisters')...one is secretly in love with hot guy. Other friend gets him. Then in the end...he realizes that he has always loved the other friend and they end up together. Blah, blah, blah.<br /><br />I guess. I have seen this storyline too much in the past few years to really appreciate it anymore. The only person that was NOT overacting was John Krasinski from The Office.<br /><br />But since I only paid $1.99....I won't be mad. I enjoyed it enough to feel like my $1.99 didn't go to waste.
B0035Q4AFC|5.0|I so enjoyed the historical aspect of Chaplin as it followed the progression of entertainment from the era of burlesque and vaudeville to silent film and the talkies.  The music was great.  Sorry Al Pacino, but Robert Downey, Jr.  should have been awarded the Oscar for his performance as Chaplin in this movie.  Kevin Kline was delightful as Douglas Fairbanks.  A must-see for anyone interested in the history of film.
B000TERJK6|5.0|You're going to find the background Rocky tracks that you are looking for in this album. It is a great match with the Rocky Story Soundtrack, as the only overlapping track is &#34;Gonna Fly Now.&#34; The only problem is that you may wish that all of the tracks were extended a little bit. Alone in the Ring and Take You Back are short, but still fantastic. Great album!
B009NY43NY|2.0|Awful end to a story I enjoyed. Everything was rushed and not what I hoped it would be. My favorite character, Eric Northman, barely appeared; after he was a predominant character in most of the previous books. I was very sad to see the way this saga was wrapped up.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I don't do a lot (or any) running anymore. However I do go for hikes and bike rides alone and with the family.  The ability to set waypoints quickly and navigate back to them is great.  Satellite reception under trees is really good, and the ability to connect a heart rate monitor is cool while using stationary equipment in the gym. It's also fun to show my son how far he walked on the map when we get home and sync it with my Garmin Connect account (which is free). Our family who loves far away can see what their grandson has been up with the share functions.
B0017I1FO4|4.0|This album is excellent for those who prefer an alternative style hard rock. Not hard-core rock, but a stronger style. As a music producer, my professional opinion is that the whole album production, songs written, story, message, reflection, presentation, intro, outro, and fluency were all at least very good...and also(of course)the vocals were awesome. Brent Smith never ceases to amaze me.<br />In short, this album is excellent but not epic...some lyrics are repetitive...but the musical part of the tracks and the presentation of Brent Smith's vocal ability are.<br />I would recommend this album to any person who is into the genre of rock.<br /><br />Take it easy
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|One of the best I've ever played.  A very fascinating puzzle box. Excitement at every turn. Can't wait for more levels. Love!
B00005NP04|5.0|She is one of my favorite female singers and her songs are inspiring and pleasant to listen to when I hear them on the radio.
B00BESJYAY|3.0|The movie is fun an motivating based on a true story.  Unfortunately the end is less than happy.  It may not be appropriate for kids.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|For those that are complaining that it doesn't work on their kindle fire, they are wrong. I finished it on my fire HD just fine.<br /><br />It has similar look and feel for me as myst. Puzzles to puzzle through.<br /><br />I didn't give 5 stars because it would freeze up a little and prevent me from zooming out and turning. Exiting out and back in again seemed to fix it. Takes a long time to load the game. It also needs to be longer. Storyline seems like it ends prematurely.
1594484805|5.0|This book has great stories and studies that flips everything we think we know about motivation upside down.  If you want to lead better this is a must read.
B006M4F67A|3.0|A very entertaining form of the game. Lots of selections and beautiful tiles. I have just started, but am enjoying it so far.
B00C061I3K|3.0|I've been into DP since the early 90s, I loved the retro sound they came with in Discovery, I do remember all the hardcore DP-heads back then talking like they had sold out ... but then after a few years it became a classic. Romanthony added heaps to the album, and I know it's very fashionable to hate vocodered/ autotuned vox these days, but this Pharrel thing is ridiculous. So now the love-robots are down with this little uber-ambitious wanna-be entrepreneur, fashion-victim media-whore? What next? Give Beyonce a guest spot? Get Pitbull to drop a verse? Marketing-wise, this is genius, as many of these kids are too young to realize how lame this dude actually is, hence they're gonna jump all over the single, and they can be all 'into' DP, but what's really happening here?<br /><br />Sorry boys, but if you're gonna use a kid who has basically made a career out of posturing as a playa, then it's going to be pretty confusing for us old-heads with this stupid single which sounds-like-it's-about-sex-but-isn't, plus the whole vibe just isn't very Daft Punk. Daft Punk reminded us ages ago that the fun of ecstasy culture was always the point ... how are we supposed to have fun with a cold-assed poser like Williams? What happened? Williams should stick with his business ventures, and go and pose somewhere else.<br /><br />Are the French boys just starting to freak out about becoming old? We're all in out late 30s now, starting to feel like we're losing touch with 'the kids'. Sadly this is how it plays out sometimes, we try to show that we're still 'cool' , and it generally goes pretty badly.<br /><br />I actually don't mind this album, but I just like hearing them play their synths, however I feel that some of the criticism is warranted ... it's not really a 'dance' album per se. The lead single does remind me a bit of One More Time when it first came out, in the sense that the kids'll love it, but old fans will find it a bit silly.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a really fun game......for all ages! The only promblem ive had is it freezes sometimes. It hasn't done it in several months.....they must of fixed it.
0399247459|5.0|My 2 year old son loves his cardboard book. Very durable and he loves listening to it on cd. Thank you for the book.
B0043URV8M|5.0|The DVD is in excellent condition, and I got it at an affordable price. This is one of the best of the Harry Potter movies, even better than Deathly Hallows Part 1.
B00CW665VI|4.0|This book was different since it was written from the man's point of view. I enjoyed the ending, I was a bit unsure in the beginning.
B004LLDN3A|4.0|WOULD LIKE COLOR ENHANCED VERSION. REVIEW DID NOT INDICATED THAT THIS WAS NOT COLOR ENHANCED.<br /><br />Otherwise, it it a great movie for kids and adults alike.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Find it very useful to me. I love the study plan options. The ease of use and keep ing me on task is awesome.
B005NK69ZC|3.0|This was like reading Ellen's notes for a monologue at the start of her show, except a really long one. With some very lame jokes. I am a huge fan of Ellen DG and have been for several decades, but this was written on autopilot. If they find the black box, they'll know she phoned it in.<br /><br />Having read Portia De Rossi's book, I imagine them in different rooms of the house, Portia writing finely crafted prose about a difficult and dark time in her life, and Ellen in another wing thinking: I might put a blank page here with just a few words on it! Yeah, that's kind of funny, and it uses up a page!
B00005JMUA|4.0|Pretty good movie, gave much more backstory and development than number one. Though I'd say Volume one is still better. Damn god movie thought.
B00C0NFMKI|2.0|Like I said..I wasn't impressed even a little bit by this CD. Most of the songs on this CD are very folkish in sound. I'm sorry if I wanted folk music I would have bought a folk CD.<br /><br />For this CD they drastically changed their sound...and not, in my opinion, for the better. I understand they lost 2 members, but seriously? Why would you change your style and sound so much in just one album? I know some artist want to branch out and see what they can do, but geez ease into it. This whole album jumped around, nothing makes sense and leaves you asking your self \\"WTF?\\"<br /><br />I loved all CD's by Para, so this CD was a great big fat let down. If I could I would return it...
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|This new alice in chains album was not what I excepting it to be, after hearing hollow i was accepting this album to be a very dark affair, but thats the thing it is dark but in a very special kind of dark, duvall and cantrell do very well at harmonizibg but you can tell when duvall takes over on the lyrics, now of course people will miss layne but this album vocals are fantastic, if you want to enjoy this album you have to think outside the box and look at alice in chains from a different perspective.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is a good app to use when you are not in the mood to work on you computer.  I can be watching a movie on TV with my husband and go online to do a quick check of Facebook.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I love this book! There are so many twists and turns. It most definitely kept me on the edge of my seat. It's exciting and a little predictable but I'm usually a person who has watched too many movies to not foresee what is going to happen, even in books. I'm glad that this was a good book because  I was iffy about it in the first place. I'm glad it showed me up. Have fun reading this book! I know I did!

0887307280|5.0|Easy read full of info for anyone looking to go into business for themselves, struggling to figure out what to do, or how to do it better.
B0015346OM|5.0|Bowden clearly spent a significant time interviewing those involved and then using other resources to piece together this outstanding work.  This book is truly a testament to the bravery, dedication, and sacrifice of the U.S. forces who engaged a savage enemy in October 1993 in Somalia.
B00847KFDS|5.0|Fogerty sounds great throughout. Arrangements are great. Kid rock version of \\"Born on the Bayou\\" okay if you<br />overlook the strangely mellow backing vocals on the chorus. Bob Seger really does sound worn out, but Fogerty holds the song up. Agree with previous reviewer -piano part sounds oddly like \\" Night Moves\\".  I thoiught voices of Dawes on Someday Never Comes\\" blended with Fogerty's least successfully, but i still like it.  Fogerty sounds great on all.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this puzzle game for Kindle Fire. They made a point to utilize the features of tablet/phone device. Too short though. Hope more like this are coming.
B005KR6O58|5.0|This movie was good, i like the way it tells the story how nothing is impossible and you must believe in what you believe in!
B008J05EL8|1.0|What a waste of time. I wish I had seen the reviews first.I would not have bothered with it. This is not something you should have to purchase separately.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|Love it brings back memories!<br />A must buy for any Sonic Fan!<br />Still have the Sega CD Version it's and exact port!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|App is awesome, but the premium access it a bit too expensive for my blood. Keep making the free app awesome you guys!
B008MIMWOO|5.0|It's Austin!<br />This is great collection, the transition to bluray is good.<br />I missed seeing these movies so many years ago!
B000TKW3E2|5.0|Whenever I play the soundtrack, I can see the scenes from the movie in my head. I am especially moved by the hymn singing as the soldiers are awaiting evacuation.

B004SBULWE|4.0|This is a must have for any Android device.<br />It helps you kill all of the apps you have running in the background even though you closed them and think they're closed!
B004PYDBVM|5.0|Not only was the story so intense I could hardly put the book down, but because of the subject matter I learned a lot about one of the tragedies going on at this very moment - the PRK gulags.
B005BDZN62|5.0|I remember watching this growing up and you could've watched it on TV every year!<br />Unfortunately they don't give it as much as they used to!<br />So i had to buy it!

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Pure Genius. When I started the game I didn't think I would fall in love with it but here I am writing this review after a few hours with a scrapped knee because of how hard I fell in love. I was so focused during the whole thing. I'm glad there's  No turning back because  I don't want to. CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE. There needs to be more games like this. WORTH EVERY DOLLAR. RANT OVER.
B007K8ILTW|5.0|Not his best, thought not his worst either. God knows he wanted to keep this from public viewing. It only serves to school young up & coming filmmakers that even maestros had to start somewhere. Worth watching.
B000SEHJGQ|2.0|If you are interested in an adolescent's who constantly focuses on sexual fantasies, his father;s abusive treatment, and his acne, this is the book for you.  It wasn't one for me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Such a good game. I play these game a lot I mean is so good I give it a 5 star rate.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Could not put it down.  I read the whole set twice.  It is almost addictive.  It will get you juices going.
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|If you have a 3D home theater, do yourself a favor -- skip the movie theater and wait for the Bluray edition.<br /><br />I watched it in a movie theater with their really crappy cardboard 3D glass -- double images and those that weren't were blurry.  It was a good movie made crappy by poorly maintained and run movie house chains with cheap, nearly non-functional 3D glasses.  Otherwise it would have been a great movie.<br /><br />My BluRay home theater 3D is much better than the movie house's, and so will your be. BluRay isn't just as good as the movie house -- it is much better.  I will be getting the BluRay when it comes out, and I doubt you will ever find me in a movie theater again.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Could not put it down.  I read the whole set twice.  It is almost addictive.  It will get you juices going.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|Pretty good game but Facebook friend connection does not work. That's my only complaint. Very addicting and great customization options.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Amazing app and very intriguing! Draws you in right away and makes you not want to put it down!!! I wish I could download every app available from this creator!
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|They've added new game features which makes this version of Quell more diverse and interesting - if that's even possible. Music is lovely and calming. If you liked Quell, you'll absolutely love Quell Memento!

B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's such a fun game. Great for horse lovers and easy game to play. It's easily addicting! 5 stars definitely.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|This is a must have for any fan of POtO. I have taken my daughter to see live performances 3 times over the past 10 years. While the American troupe that performs here are excellent, they can't compete with the London cast (sorry). Seeing it performed in London makes it special even though it's just on tv. The very best part is the special ending where all the old phantoms are brought out to perform together along with Ms. Brighton. ALW made a masterpiece and this is just another opportunity to watch his genius.
B008D2YF1M|5.0|Harper Lee was encouraged to write some of her childhood memories. What in the beginning seems like the story of three childhood friends in depression era Macomb, Alabama, turns out to be packed with insights to the makeup of human kind.<br /><br />This story is intriguing on many levels from the history of the area to the stereotyping of people. Most of all every turn was a surprise as told in the first person from the view of Scout Finch. And instead of telling the story in a six year old vocabulary she uses an exceptionally large repertoire to describe the people and events. This story is not as slow passed as one may guess from first glance as every remark and every action will be needed for a future action.<br /><br />A major controversial part of the story is the trial of Tom Robinson. Hoverer this is just a catalyst to help Scout understand the nature of people including her father Atticus and you will find that as important as it is it is just a part of the story with other major characters such as Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley.<br /><br />Even thought it appears that Scout is the recipient of the insights, I believe we the reader is the real recipient.<br /><br />I can truly say that this book has changed my outlook in life.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0783225857 To Kill a Mockingbird (Collector's Edition)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0670010952 Harper Lee (Up Close)]]
B00002Z88D|5.0|I LOVE THIS ALBUM, ITS LIKE A BEST OF THE BEST FOR METALLICA WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY ADDING TO METALLICA'S INTENSITY. WAY AWESOME ALBUM, I LISTEN TO TRACKS FROM IT EVERY TIME I GO TO THE GYM. IF YOU LOVE METALLICA, THEN YOU NEED THIS ALBUM.
B000J56LR2|5.0|Hitler must ultimately decide what threats are real and when.  He relies on the one man he knows can accomplish the task of finding out the truth.  So he sends to England \\"The Needle\\" a deep cover spy who is so confident that he does not let the intermediate folk get in his way. Any that do do not live to tell about it.<br /><br />First, they have to believe that he actually exists.  Then they have to find him.  It they can find him, can they stop him?<br /><br />Yes, the story is intriguing.  Yet it is the people interaction (loyalty, love, and credibility) and the attitude of \\"The Needle\\" that make the story.  Ultimately, the question is \\"Will he succeed and what effect will this have on future generations of those who knew him?\\"<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000035P5E Eye of the Needle]]
B0000240NH|4.0|THIS ALBUM HAS SOME OF MY FAVORITE METALLICA TRACKS ON IT, SUCH AS &#34;TURN THE PAGE&#34; AND &#34;WHISKY IN THE JAR&#34;. GETS YOU PUMPED FOR THE GYM.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Awesome book can't wait to read another by same author.  Recommend this book for those who enjoy suspense and great storytelling
B00CW665VI|5.0|I read this book with a smile on my face from the very first page.  This book was from the point of view of Drew, a rich successful Investment Banker who thinks he's God's gift to women. He's a total man-whore with the attitude to go with it!  I loved how his mind works! You would think he would be an unlikeable character, but he didn't come out that way.  I read this book off and on at work and there were a few times where I laughed out loud! Reading this book was like watching a movie. The descriptions were so vivid. It felt like you were there when Drew described his heart-ache and sorrow regarding Kate.  This was a great story with like able characters from the main characters through the supporting cast. I highly recommend it!
B000P12LWY|1.0|I bought the whole series of DVDS based on the glowing reviews here. I had never seen the show since it was on Showtime. I was expecting a sexy but interesting account of life in the old royal families, but the acting was horrible! The story lines \\"climaxed\\" in bedroom scenes all too often. The jousting scenes were really boring. The only somewhat interesting thing was how involved the churches were in politics. And unless you have a real interest in King Henry 8th, you'll be hard pressed to follow who the characters are.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Installed and had to restart phone in order for it to work but I have not been able to put it down
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|Great action film! Schwarzenegger & Whitaker, super support cast, outstanding photography and editing, super stunts, blood, guts, comic relief, tight plot line, light romance mixed in with the modern wild west, a nod to the film \\"High Noon\\", even some Las Vegas bright lights thrown in! Escapism, to be sure, but in a fun way. Schwarzenegger still packs a punch!
B004CLYKLI|2.0|All I could think about while reading this book was that the children should have been removed by CPS. It read much more like Sarah Burleton's [[ASIN:1470052555 Why Me?]] than any parenting guide!!<br /><br />The author had every trait of extreme Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Here's a quote at the end of the book: \\"My family, friends, and even my attorney, advised me from publishing this book for fear of how the American public would judge my actions. I think otherwise.\\" :O<br /><br />-Read 55,021 words in 3 days (18,340 words/day; 1,002,842 words in May)
B005SH5K7I|5.0|This movie is a fun romantic comedy good for the whole family.  Kevin James is hilarious and the movie has a feel-good happy ending.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|its fun, glitches very little though cash will be needed past a certain point. all in all a fun game. I would recommend it!
B00CRS88IO|5.0|I was given an advance review copy by the author in return for an honest review. I'm pleased to report that \\"The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Armada\\" was a joy to read from page one. The James Bond references are present and it's fun spotting the very subtle (to the point of being almost muted) allusions. But this is also a smart, meticulously researched historical novel. It's a perfect length for a Kindle thriller, about the length of \\"Casino Royale.\\" I stayed up late and finished in one sitting. Very hard to put down. The writing is brilliant. It's obvious author Stevenson was a successful screenwriter. Every page drips with fascinating historical nuggets. He writes about Secret Service weapons and Nazi uniforms in some detail at times but it's fascinating. The depth of research is mind blowing at times. How did he unearth so much detail about Ian Fleming? I thought I knew a lot about him but this is rich in facts that I had to double check as I read. The book puts you right there in occupied France during June 1940.<br /><br />I really liked the General Bock and Denise Astier characters. The women, even the secretaries in Room 39, are fully dimensional and more than just appendages for the tough guys. Ian Fleming is a fascinating protagonist. Here he is, a nobody in 1940 living in his famous brother Peter Fleming's shadow (Peter Fleming was a successful travel writer in the 1940s, married to the celebrated English theater and later movie star Celia Johnson - she was in `Brief Encounter' in 1945), frustrated at being desk bound and yearning for the recognition that we know he will later achieve as an author in the 1950s. What a compelling concept for a hero. We all know Fleming will be famous but he doesn't know it - yet - and all the turmoil he has to put up with and go through during World War II will fuel the novels he will later go on to write, a series of books that will touch the world for the next sixty years (and the machine shows no sign of slowing. The books have sold over 100 million copies in print and last year's `Skyfall' grossed over a billion dollars).<br /><br />It's sad Fleming died relatively young at age 54 in 1964. Still he got to see `Dr.No' (1962) and `From Russia With Love' (1964) come out to roaring successes.<br /><br />Read this book if you are a Bond fan and read it if you are not and want to learn what all the fuss is about. It all started here, in occupied France, in June 1940.
B0033AI4PM|5.0|This is the first movie (when I was a child) I've ever seen of hers. I instantly became a lifetime fan. This is Barbra's greatest movie in my opinion. Glad all her movies are coming out on blu-ray. i own mostly VHS of her movies. Her live concerts on dvd. So upgrading my collection to blu-ray is a must. Waiting patiently for Nuts and The Mirror Has Two Faces.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|If you're like me and you like a nice book to read now and then, then this one is for you. Good holiday read. Same sort of pace as The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society (which I loved). Not action packed but a good story that moves along.  You really just want to know what happens to Harold, Queenie and Maureen in the end.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I mostly gave up using my old whetstones and use this as my go-to sharpener for everything that needs an edge (except axes and chainsaws). I keep one in the kitchen, too as it is quick and easy for use there.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Still I rate this 10 stars! If only they had endermen and more herobrine. That would be cool! This game rocks !
B008FRFN7A|2.0|NOT WITH MY PRINTER SAD BAD MAD SAD MAD BAD I DON'T LIKE THIS EITHER I'LL SKIP NEXT TIME BYE
B004RKXN44|5.0|The romance that was hinted in the previous books comes to fruition.  A true alpha in both title and attitude has a rough road to getting his HEA especially since Sienna refuses to be less than an equal.  Hot romance, sweet wooing, and stubborn affection make the perfect ride for the two but more than just that affects both the wolves and cats ... War!  A definite great read!
B001IFZL50|5.0|I am a huge fan of this series, and after borrowing the DVDs from my brother, I bought the BluRay version.  I've even watched it with commentary.  Very interesting and entertaining.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This was a really good book.  Very different from what I usually read, but I really enjoyed it.  Kept me in suspense all the way through.  Well worth buying.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|As the title indicates, I bought this album when it was on special, not knowing anything about the group, and before they were being played on the radio non-stop. I was hooked from the first song!! Some people unrighteously compare this group to U2....I say those people have no taste in music!!!<br />Every song on this album is wonderfully done, and the sound is so original and haunting.It has been on the playlist since I purchased , and cannot bring myself to take it off....I have not got tired of it!<br />Favorites:<br />Bleeding out<br />Hear me<br />Underdog<br />On top of the world<br /><br />Definitely give this album a chance, and pay no attention to the critics.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love this game, it's incredibly fun, and addictive. GET THE GAME. Unlike the first it has goals and a lot more super fun stuff, but at times it does lag, so if that's a turn off for you beware
B0080XN3C6|5.0|First heard of Kimbra from her gotye guest on 'someone I used to know' (before it was #1 most played on the radio). Ok, if you want to know more about Kimbra, watch her youtube video of her live performances of both these songs: &#34;sxsw:settle down&#34;, and live version of &#34;plain gold ring&#34;, also her performance of &#34;two weeks/head over heels&#34; on triple J radio. Oh my my my I was hooked after those and this was before her album was released in the US!! So i pacified my hunger for more of her sound with watching her various youtube vids as listed above. I really wish she would release a B-sides album of sorts featuring all her live performances before she was famous.....<br /><br />Anyways, every song on this album is awesome! Her voice has so much range, and the way she mixes every song is just magical.<br />BUY THIS ALBUM!!
B000W4D94I|5.0|A long-time favorite movie.  I love the way Hunt and Paxton work together.  The Blu-ray transfer is great, beautiful picture, terrific sound.  Extras are the same as with the 2-disc DVD set, nothing new.  Worth the cost to upgrade from DVD for the improved picture quality.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|It was a very entertaining read.  I learned alot about alot of stuff and now it is in my head to remember.
B001AQT0RC|5.0|Another one of my all-time favorite movies, brought up to speed with a great Blu-ray transfer, finest kind sound and picture.  Definitely better that watching your DVD upconverted on a big screen.  Jodie Foster gives a terrific performance as Ellie, and James Woods does a great job of making you want to choke the living crap out of Michael Kitz.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|Charging extra money for the 2d disc is gouging consumers. Will not buy even though we liked the movie. Hope this isn't a new trend.
B008I34YYY|5.0|This movie is a lot more entertaining than an awful lot of \\"A\\" movies out there.  I mean really, what is not to like about an attack by Nazis from the dark side of the moon?  Well cast, great production values, good effects and great-looking Nazi tech.  This is really well done and I can't wait to see what the people who made it come up with next.
B00847KFDS|4.0|For almost the last half century John Fogerty has been one of the absolute best song writers to me. This guy has written so many timeless classics that it makes me wonder where he gets the ability? I have just about everything he's ever done, and this album is no different.<br /><br />While I wish this would have been a completely new album from J.C. Fogerty, this album is pretty cool for what it is. I absolutely love the Foo Fighters track of \\"Fortunate Son,\\" this is my favorite Creedence song, and this collaboration is awesome. The rest of the songs are all well done as well. Kid Rock, Keith Urban and the Zach Brown band all make appearances also. The only thing I'll say that is a little disappointing is that the album seems to be more country than anything else. This is to be expected considering John has always had an affinity for country, but some of us don't. That's minor, and I can overlook it quite easily.<br /><br />If you like John in any way, this album should be enjoyed. My first love musically is hard rock and metal, but I grew up listening to CCR with my dad, and I still crank these guys like their 24 again. This guy should be recognized as one of the best singer-songwriters in the history of music; he's earned that right in my book.
B00884GR0W|5.0|This game rocks I mean really it's like a knight game it has dragons, scorpians, and much more there are vehicles too like jetpacks, cars, and a boat I mean this game rocks like wow! So this is the best game I've ever had. So if I were u I would get this game immediately! Please get!
B00B0YL0E0|4.0|Pretty Maids released their \\"Motherland\\" CD in 2013. Much like all their other albums, this is pretty straight forward melodic hard rock with hints of metal at times. This could easily be one of the Maids best records, and it's easily one of my favorites.<br /><br />The first thing that jumped out to me was, this album is really well produced and has some powerfully written songs. Most of the songs seem to deal with political upheaval and issues, but they don't go all Rage Against the Machine on us here. Pretty Maids simply state how much the world sucks on a daily basis. The songs are also pretty rocking throughout; there are the occasional ballads( and lets face it, these guys can make a ballad) which slow the record down a bit, but nothing too awful for my tastes. My favorite tracks were \\"Mother of All Lies,\\" \\"Motherland,\\" \\"Who,What,Where,When\\" and \\"Bullet For You.\\" The rest are winners though as well.<br /><br />This album would have been five-stars for me, but there was just the littlest amount of filler that crept in and kept it from that designation. The songs that are good, are really good, but some songs just seemed a little to boring for me. Overall really strong offering.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Had it open and operating in &#60;5 minutes after receipt!!!  I can imagine he'll be using it to dazzle his students.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|It was so sad that this little girl had to endure so much trauma and pain.  But the way she has dealt with it since her release is absolutely incredible.
0670026603|5.0|I couldn't put the book down.  It was engaging from beginning until the end. The author has a wonderful writing style.  It's very descriptive, yet easy to read.<br />I can definitely see this book as a movie. (with the right characters, of course).
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Few science fiction books lend themselves so readily to movie adaptation. This Wool series would be perfect for the big screen, stairway footsteps echoing throughout a darkened theater, and moviegoers considering for a brief second how their closed-door cineplex society resembles that of the silo.<br /><br />I'm hoping there's more Wool to come.
0756407915|5.0|If you haven't had a chance to read this series, now is the time to get started.  I was thoroughly impressed by the first book, and this book has completely met all my expectations.  Great book!
B0084HJE0S|4.0|I liked that it was to the point and gave a great over view of the beginnings of html an js.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|I've been hanging onto my videotape of this classic Western so I was so pleased with this package.  Really great---not only the color and quality of the film, but also added supplement about production with actors' and director's interviews.  Confirmed my thinking that Lonesome Dove is one of the greatest Westerns (along with The Searchers) of all time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great fun although I can't go to miami which I don't like. fun game for kids addictive fun characters cool locations and Its really good it's is a more  cartoon version of temple run
B0014DQSG2|5.0|This was a good clean flick for the whole family.  Great story line and I liked the actors as well.  Even my hubby liked it.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|i like it alot i just want more and the sounds with the right dino but this good game. but still needs alittle work!!!
B00C2VIA52|5.0|I've spent countless hours playing and now have 5 decks. Loads of fun. I only wish I could play it offline. Save your earnings to get more decks and cards.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|Big fan of Sci-Fi! Appreciate the quality of this show. Special affects are great; especially for television! Great cast too!
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I am very satisfied with the Marware Vibe Standing Case for my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;. It fits my Kindle Fire perfectly.<br />Anyone who has this Kindle Fire I would recomend this case. It fits in most of my bags. I take it with me all the time.
B009NY43NY|1.0|The fact that Sookie winds up with Sam was not surprising to me but needed to be one or two books later.  All of the previously well-liked and full characters were turned into shallow, self-serving individuals.  The author finally &#34;sold out&#34; her characters and story line just like the TV series.  I am sure Charlaine Harris could have done a much a better job but just got &#34;tired&#34; of her characters and story and disappointed all of her Sookie fans. Her last book reminds me of my daughter's writing skills when she was in the sixth grade.  She wold write an excellent story base with well developed characters and a strong plot.  As time would go by and the story could not meet time constraints, everybody just died or went away.  Felt as though I was reading the final chapter written by someone in the sixth grade!<br />Don't think I would ever buy another Cahrlaine Harris book.  Have read some of her other works and enjoyed them but this last book makes me believe that she is just tired and no longer cares to write.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Not your typical courtroom thriller that you've come to expect from Grisham but an incredible story nonetheless.  One of my favorites that I've read thus far
1400052181|4.0|I believe Ms Skloot was a young woman just out of college who became facinated by the story from her high school biology class.  Somehow she herself founded this multi-year venture and also had the tenacity to push on as numerous obstacles were placed in her path.  As I recall, she fininshed the research in about 2001 yet it was not published until 2010.  Correct??  If so, why?<br /><br />There was a lot of detail that I could have done without - 50 to 75 pages less would have been just fine.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I really like this game. It took me a while to get used to how to play but now I enjoy it very much.
1623420148|5.0|This book was great! Drew Evans is a total ass (I mean that in the nicest way possible)I was laughing out loud, cringing, smiling. Reading the book from his point of view was so different. I loved the characters and Katherine (Kate) was a great foil for Drew. She gave as good as she got and their banter and fighting was hilarious. I loved the tender moments and when you could see Drew finally changing his horn-dog ways. The supporting characters were as funny and interesting as the main characters. I would recommend this book, you will not be disappointed. Can't wait for the next installment, Emma Chase is my new favorite author!
B00CW665VI|5.0|Such a fun read. The male lead is a surprising change. A great voice to listen to. There are several cliches but this is still definitely worth it. His analogies are the best, extremely funny.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I love all these types of games. Challenging and keeps me wanting more. The only thing is it says free. Gets you going then to continue you have to pay. Should just charge for game up front instead of advertising for free
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game for the money,some of the puzzles are harder than they should be, less responsive when puzzle completed.  What i thought was right was.
B0019UGYK0|5.0|bought this for a geat friend that thought this movie was lost and not able to get anymore.they loved it.
B00CW665VI|5.0|It was a different perspective than I am used to reading and I loved it.  I would love  to read more in the series.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This is a well made app by Disney.  I honestly use it more than my son.  The music ( theme of Nemo - variety) is very relaxing and I use it before bed for downtime and clearing my mind.<br />The screen is bursting with color and movement of the fish and plants seem lifelike. The more you add to your reef the more characters show up. Nemo crew and special fish. IAP: WARNING- yes it requires money to purchase pearls for speeding up plant development or to get certain items for the reef. Pricing Imo seemed fair so I did purchase one family pack and that was all I needed. I normally wouldn't give an app a chance if they have IAP but this is the one that seemed worth it.<br />You will have to decide but even if you don't buy its still a game the kids can goof off with that's relaxing. You just cant achieve Nemos goals.<br />Good luck. Floridamom
B001XCWPAM|5.0|I have the regular dvd's of the Bourne movie's and had to have them on Blu-Ray. Yes they are that good. Hats off to Frank Marshal.<br /><br />  Danny, Kuna Idaho
B000U1ZV8K|1.0|Beware.  I bought the Blu-Ray version of this 4-pack at a retail store and the Lethal Weapon 2 disc--LW2 graphics on it and all--ended up being the Travolta awful-fest Swordfish.  Warner Brothers is clearly trying to screw some customers to get rid of backlog.  This has nothing to do with Amazon or the movies themselves, this is a comment on the cheaper one of the 4-disc compilation products and Warner Brothers only.  They got me on this one, don't let them get you.  I'm paying for the full price one next time.  And I do love the Lethal Weapon series enough to spend on it again.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Best movie I have ever seen, absolutely loved this movie and shows the true ways mental illness can effect a family with GREAT HUMOR throughout it! We loved it!!
0634086782|5.0|This book is phenomenal. I'm a professional musician and composer with a classical background and I love getting theory books to get new ideas and understand non-classical methods of thinking. I can honestly say that this book is one of the best I've ever found. Because it was written by both a jazz musician and classical musician, ideas are explained in ways that are very easy for me to relate to, but the book also reveals jazz concepts I was unfamiliar with. I have learned a ton from this book and it is a permanent and welcome addition to my library.<br /><br />It is well written, easy to understand, flows well, and is organized very clearly. I have to say, I wish I had gotten this instead of getting Levine's book years ago. I'm still glad I have Levine's book, but I find this to be a great counterweight to it.<br /><br />My only issue is that there are several typos I discovered within the first minutes of reading through it. Some chords are mislabeled, Usually when this happens it is pretty obvious so no harm no foul, but it is the only hangup in an otherwise outstanding text. Highly recommended.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Nice app.<br />I enjoy knowing what the weather is when I want.  This seems to be close to actual weather.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This App does everything as advertised. It heps me better manage my device and find any problems with battery use.  I have no complaints.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|I haven't read the book so I have no complaints about it not following the original storyline. I just felt like watching a movie and came across this. I will probably never watch it again. I do not feel this is a movie that should be bought and kept as a classic. It is entertaining without leaving much of an aftertaste. I will never have a deep convo about this movie and nor will I recommend this to any of my friends. Just something to pass the time if you can't find anything else that catches your eye as your browsing through the Amazon movies to rent.
1476734941|4.0|interesting - have started to loose weight.- am not fully into five / two process.- but am workinbg towards this target - am aged 74!!
B0094D462M|4.0|Classic Movie. Some of the best Military Action Scenes of the Era.<br />The Romance scenes are lame - But that is what fast forward is for.
B005AKFXZW|5.0|Just my sort of book. When I finished it I just wanted to start reading it all over again. So I did. And it was even better the second time around.
B00COHIFQS|3.0|Movie was good with enough twists & turns and made the family jump. But the ending left a lot to be desired.
B00B2FLDRQ|4.0|A really delightful read. Taking a serious subject and turning it around so that it becomes fun to read is a great achievment.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|I lost all my levels and coins over night. I'm not sure what happened but to keep playing seems like a waist of time if my stuff is just going delete it's self.

B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|this is an amazing game I really suggest it for anyone you just can't be a crybaby because it's pretty intense an scary. I could play this game everyday. If you love intense and scary game  this is the game for u
B002BCNK1Q|4.0|I thought this was a very good movie although Eastwood should have hired better actors to play the parts of the main Asian characters in the movie.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this game, it is intense and fun. My duaghter and I are always competting to see who can get the better score. I have gotten many friends and family members into the game also.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|This is a spectacular Bond film. Daniel Craig once again delivers a rush of action with the wittiness of what made James Bond long ago!
B000063DGC|5.0|I recently ordered this after finding my old audio tape version from back in the late 80's.  Most people know Randy is a phenomenal guitarist, but after not having listened in years (and being a guitarist myself) I was reminded of just how good he was.<br /><br />Speed and sound aside, the harmonies and melodic sounds he puts together just leave me in awe.  Still sad to see such a talents life cut too short.<br /><br />If by some stretch you're an Ozzy fan and haven't heard this or are familiar with it, first what rock were you living under?  :-) Second, get the album and enjoy.
B007US9NA8|5.0|This book totally fit you if you really want to know about body building, you miss it simply mean you miss the master of this!
B005723JSQ|5.0|Love a book that makes me smile while I'm reading and makes me wish I didn't reach the end. Love how well you feel you know all the characters personally.
B007REV4T8|3.0|It was a good movie, lots of action, but I was not very happy that that they killed off M
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I have dozens of USB cables , even Amazon branded cables, none of them seem to fit just right  and I often had issues with charging and data transfer if the cable got bumped. this one fits perfectly and has never had even a minor hiccup, Highly recommended! if you want it to work right  get this one.
B0091REZMW|4.0|fun game...worth the download.  has a nice story line and it changes up your searches so it doesn't become so repetitive.
B00006I53S|5.0|Recently, I trekked up the Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks National Monument in New Mexico. Hey, I'd admit, I'm not in the best shape, but carrying around a ton of lenses didn't make a lot of sense to me.  With my camera bag and monopod, I brought this lens and two other lenses.  I never broke out the other two.  The pictures and the video with my Canon 60D were incredible!<br /><br />A terrific all around, walkabout lens, I'd certainly recommend it for the amateur photographer.
B00785P2QC|4.0|A great game for all , strategic planning, very addicting and awesome graphics to look at. One of my favorites to play always.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Yea I know I said azmazing not amazing its my word if any of u people steal it I will HUNT U DOWN!Anyways this game is sooo awesome I just wish it was more HD on the kindle fire but other than that I LOVE IT!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the best scifi worlds I've visited in a long time. Great characters. Intriguing reveals. A real triumph. Thanks!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This  was a great ending to a super entertaining trilogy of books.. the story line kept me riveted from beginning to end.. loved every word and story line.  Definitely three of my favorite books ever....
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Makes you proud to be an American. These guys are the definition of greatness and this story conveys that reputation very concisely.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It's meant to inspire creativity and does this very well. Great for a type A that likes organization - separating finds on boards for specific topics.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|We avoided the good wife for nearly 4 years, being dubious about yet another lawyer show and the term &#34;wife&#34; implying that the protagonist was secondary to a &#34;husband.&#34;  But getting desperate with nothing on TV, we checked out all the seasons, and it turned out to be one of the best written and acted shows on television ever.  DVD extras indicate that most of the show's writers are lawyers and the verisimilitude and insight into the legal profession and profession are impressive.  The storyweaving of multiple plot lines for many engaging characters is expert.
B007MDB71O|5.0|This is now one of my favourite SiFi movies. Absolutely grand and a true cult classic. I can't believe it didn't do we'll in the box office!? We have to find a way to convince Hollywood to make the other books in the series into movies.....
1400034779|4.0|Recommened by a friend who had read it, I also enjoyed it.<br />Good descriptions of local life and people living near the Botswana capital of Gabarone.<br />The lady is a sharp cookie and it's fun to read of how she solves various problems.<br />I will try for the second in the series.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|It took me a while to get into this movie. I recommend watching the special features and deleted scenes first as they really fill some gaps. I'm now looking forward to the next one!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This software brings an excellent performance to manage your battery life an to program your charging time without hesitation. I recommend this software.
B00AW57L96|5.0|This book was by far the best book that I have read in years.  I loved the different characters and how they came together.  I did not want this book to end.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Great game to pass the time. Hand/eye coordination a must! Makes you plan ahead to score those blockbuster combos and with the background music you're always trying to go faster!
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This game is awesome. Its just like TF2. The classes or basically the same but some of them with different names and its world war 2.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|This started off a bit slow but picked up nicely with a lot of twist and turns..I would recommend this movie
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Incredibly creative and imaginative. Makes you think outside of the box while trying to get inside the box. Love it.
B000IDEORY|5.0|This is my go to rainy day flick. Or sunny day or any day. I miss johnny castle! Watch it of you haven't
B0002KZAKS|5.0|This microphone performs very well with my Canon Vixia camcorder, but not so well when plugged into a computer.  That's fine, because I got it to use with the camcorder and pick up voices when outdoors or the computer mic needs some help.  I'm not that familiar with the technical aspects of microphones, so I relied on Amazon reviewers for &#34;real world&#34; thoughts.  I'm very happy that I followed their advice, because this a very nice microphone, especially for the price!
B00CW665VI|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I found the style and guy's POV very entertaining.  I can't wait for the next one!
B00BHF9SHS|5.0|I was lucky enough to get this album early from the UK.  Alison Moyet is a tremendous artist so I expected to like her latest release but I was blown away on the first listen.  Fun, moving, infectious songs get stuck in your head in the BEST possible way.  If you're a fan don't wait.  If you are not familiar you should give Alison Moyet's the minutes a little of your time!
1878424750|3.0|I like listening to this when I'm driving to work to help me get in the right attitude - I have a very stressful job.
B009NY43NY|4.0|It's hard to see it end, but it is definitely time for Sookie to move on. I really enjoyed it.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Thought that this was a great book. I also enjoyed the next book even more than the first one. c
B005LAIIJY|1.0|The language in this movie is so bad that neither my wife nor myself could set through it!  I think the story would have been great but with the &#34;f&#34; word being spoken almost every other word, it ruins it!  Shame on all the supposedly &#34;great&#34; Hollywood actors and producers for their use of such vile words in their movies.  If they think this adds to the movies, in my opinion, they are very wrong!  I ABSOLUTELY WOULD NOT recommend this movie!!!
B00COMLLX2|5.0|Wow.  I have to admit I didn't expect to get sucked in so completely, but this pinball game is hella fun. The neat thing about digital pinball is that there is a lot more scope forspecial gameplay and effects. I have played the default Sorceror,,Tesla, and Shaman tables. Guys, the free Amazon coins you might get is brilliant for using go buy more tables. The steampunky Tesla table is my favorite, but the Sorceror has these neat mini-games, and Shaman has these elevated secondary playing areas. So very very much worth the free download and couple bucks for extra tables.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|The graphics are good and it has some cool stuff..Like all of them you have invite friends, I Don't like that part.....
B009AMANBA|5.0|This movie is remarkably true to the times. It was seminal eras for both the country and its coming to grips with the All men are created equal.  Daniel Day Lewis was very convincing as Lincoln.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I really do love this movie. I think I watched it nine times in the first week I had it. Definitely Anna Kendrick's second chance after being in Twilight :) If you're thinking about buying this, just do it. You'll love it
B004LWZW7O|5.0|Deff worth getting on blu-ray; lots of action and those flat black baraccudas are sweet.  It's deff liberal propoganda but I can appreciate the story as it is not an apples-to-apples comparison of wealth distribution in America.  I saw it in the theatre, rented it from Redbox once, and finally bought it.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|The game is fun. Graphics are good and collecting dinosaurs is fun. I have had the patients so far to collect coins and slowly (frustratingly slow) been collecting coins to gain dinosaurs, get food for them, level them up, search for DNA, researching, and collecting dinosaurs with out spending actual money. Everything is so expensive. It's makes the game so much less fun for free players. I have a few games like this and have found the developers of those games have made it so free players can save up for things with more ease, although you still must be patient. This game is impossible to save enough dinosaurs dollars to buy anything unless you spend  a ridiculous amount of real money. Plus its buggy.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|Miched Pollan does it again, writig talent combined with mouth watering topics. Only people who actually go and eat what he writes about can understand the book properly :-)
B0095D8ZAA|5.0|I think I'm addicted to this game. playing on my Kindle Fire until my battery dies.  :-(  Glad I purchased the \\"ADD-FREE\\" version). This game was introduced to me by a friend. This posting is actually coming from<br /> A RETIRED train conductor.  :-)
B00A81NFAS|5.0|Loved the movie and it's great having it in my collection.  The special features were great also. It also arrived quickly and in perfect condition.
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|If you have played the game online, then it is exactly the same as playing it on the Kindle. It is fun and there is a great assortment of levels. Goos game
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book will be one of my all time favorites! Am currently reading the \\"Shift Omnibus Collection\\", his follow-up series to \\"Wool\\". \\"Shift\\" is very good, but in my humble opinion, not quite as good as \\"Wool\\"... which I couldn't put down. I will read this book again and again in the coming years, as I do all my favorites.
1576875776|5.0|Stunning photos of everyday people.  They seem so real they jump off the page. Can't wait to see the other books of this photo collection.
B007GFDVEE|5.0|My son loves these series.  I got them for X-mas and his birthday is coming up, so I plan to get more.
B00AKKTDJY|1.0|I got this as the free app of the day a few weeks ago and was able to access all of the levels, contrary to what others had said they were able to do.  Today I found an update and made the mistake of installing it without looking at the reviews.  Now all of the levels above where I am are locked until I pay .99 to unlock them.  VERY annoyed with this cheap shot.
B000YMJA7I|5.0|I only buy songs that I love or that my family love.  This is one of those songs.  My love of music crosses many genres and this song has a great sound to it.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I read \\"Gone Girl\\" first and loved it. I wouldn't normally pick up a dark, psychological thriller but I wanted to read all of Flynn's novels after reading \\"Gone Girl.\\" I couldn't put \\"Sharp Objects\\" down. I was so intrigued and only a few scenes in the book made me want to cringe (as opposed to many in other dark thrillers I've read). This book is a great combination of dark thriller scenes and light scenes. The mystery part kept me guessing until the end. Can't wait to read Flynn's next book.
B00C391Y3I|4.0|The band is fine form and Rob Halford's voice has held up incredibly well.  Richie Faulkner fits in well and Tipton has not lost anything.  I deducted a star because the frenetic over produced nature of the product.  The excessive smash cutting is distracting. Maybe the director got paid on a \\"per edit\\" basis because there is no excuse for this type of high school editing.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|This movie doesn't age because of its historical setting.  Inspirational, another overcoming obstacles film.<br />The sound track is amazing too.  It's become a classic.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Love the graphics, ease of the interphase, the logic to the puzzles. I feel totally engaged and curious. The 3D puzzles are awesome to figure out. Very well done! An e exceptional game for Kindle Fire HD.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Characters are bonded in the first season, little bit of sticky, ectoplasmic gew but not so much you get sick of it. It is a cross between the family feel of Star Trek, possible bizarre outcomes of applied quantum physics introduced in such presentations as &#34;What the Bleep...&#34;, and Through the Wormhole&#34;, and a classic approach/avoidance love story. And if you are in the medical-forensic professions, you just have to love Walter..NOTHING grosses this cuddly, mad-scientist Dad out!
B00CL68BK2|5.0|The story is gutsy in it's willingness to familiarize it's audience with mental illness.  The acting is super from the whole cast.  One could actually believe you are watching a dysfunctional family.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|Great depiction of the origins of the x-men, can't wait for days of future past! This cast lineup made the movie so enjoyable in its own right!
B00340LM8C|5.0|If you like Hitchcock and Grant you'll love this movie!  Of course it's over-acted as is usual for this genre, but who cares? Sit down, relax and enjoy the scenery of France.
B0044DEAUA|2.0|Initially got this product for my iPhone and it worked okay in the car.  However, it would keep working when I went into my house and that caused problems. It would stay charged for a long time, but when it lost a charge, it would continually beep, the off switch did not work.  Very frustrating!  I switched to a Android phone it would never sync up with my device (Samsung G3 and became totally useless.  overall I found it more irritating than useful.  I would recommend looking for a more reliable product.
0307476073|5.0|I didn't want Cheryl's trip to end though it did. I struggled with her every step and enjoyed each and every kindness that came her way. I cared about her and applaud her. That she didn't quit countless times is inspiring.
