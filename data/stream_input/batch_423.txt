B00024BHTC|1.0|I cannot agree with any of these reviews.  This album is stupid.  There has never been much talent from Finland over the years apart from perhap Stratovariuos.  But this band ain't as good.
0312995423|2.0|Well it would have been hypocritical not to give it a couple of stars since I read it to the end. Wish I'd resisted the urge to do that, but the short chapters and the-thrill (even murder)-a-minute pace, like a bad addiction, were hard not to give in to. <br />The flaws in the plot were gargantuan. Would be interesting to have a contest to see who could tally the largest list. (Don't read further if you plan to read the book!) Several come to mind immediately. The main thrust of the book is that Strathmore, the Deputy Director of NSA, was attempting to write a back door to a rogue encryption algorithm that he thought (mistakenly) was for all practical purposes capable of producing uncrackable codes. The world unknowingly would get his doctored algorithm, and NSA could secretively snoop the production of its codes.  This he was doing in secret on a weekend in his office. So he invites the attractive Susan over for some reason. But why? She could only blow his cover. <br />Another. Somehow Strathmore figures that the author of the original algorithm would never bother to check or would have great difficulty checking the revised version that NSA would put on the Net against his original. You run a BINCOM program and see in about 2 seconds that modifications have been made. <br />Then there's the 2 billion-dollar computer that burns up because it was drawing too much current and it could not be cut off. I guess they ran out of money for circuit breakers. Later a machine with the NSA database of sensitive data could not be unplugged from the Internet when its access regulation was being thwarted by a worm. Etc., etc.<br />`Course without the flaws, like with much fiction, you wouldn't have had much of a story, but Brown stretched things wildly.<br />Now I need to figure out the flaw in my makeup that led me to use my time this way.
B000268QB2|4.0|Keane's debut album has been 6+ years in the making, kinda hard to believe, but true. The British trio formed in the late 90s, and toiled away in obscurity for years, until finally catching a break when a rep from Fierce Panda Records (yup, the same label that gave Coldpay its first break) saw them and gave them a one-off single release, which sparked a bidding war from the bigger labels.<br />&quot;Hopes and Fears&quot; (11 tracks, 45 min.) is a beautiful record. The trio (drums, bass, keyboards, no guitars) shows its maturity of being around 6+ years. Lead singer Tom Chaplin reminds me of Travis' Fran Healy. But please no comparisons to Coldplay! If anything, the comparison should be to equally piano-lead Ben Folds Five. The highlights on the album include the openers &quot;Somewhere Only We Know&quot; and &quot;This is The Last Time&quot; and also &quot;Everybody Changing&quot; (all of which charted as UK singles). Also outstanding is the epic &quot;She Has No Time&quot;, and &quot;Untitled 1&quot;, the longest tracks on the album.<br />Keane has been the darlings of the (fickle) UK music press, before they went on to declare the Darkness and Franz Ferdinand as the &quot;new big thing&quot;. Regardless, this is a great album, and with a chance of making some waves here in the US too. Strongly recommended!
6305311463|5.0|Okay, there's a reason that we go to the movies...to escape everyday life and just enjoy some good old fun for a couple of hours and this movie does it.  I don't know, maybe I'm just a Bruce Willis fan, but this movie did entertain me and it's on cable right now and I'm watching it, which is what compelled me to write and defend this fun movie because everyone else is trashing it!
B000002UYZ|3.0|Music: 5 stars;  Economic Value: 1 Star<br />Not counting the Anthology albums in the 90's (which are not hit compilations anyway), the Beatles have in the last 30 years been compiled only once, on 2000's &quot;1&quot;, an excellent overview for what it is, their best known and biggest hits. The 1973 &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; compilations remain in print, and I guess are still selling. While the &quot;Blue&quot; 1967-1970 compilation justifies its continued availibility on 2 CDs, one really has to question why the &quot;Red&quot; 1962-1966 compilation does.<br />&quot;The Beatles 1962-1966&quot; (26 tracks) clocks in at 62 min., way below the capacity of a single CD, yet remains on the shelf as 2 CDs (along with a heftly $31 retail price). This is nothing short of ripping off the buying public, in my opinion. The reason given by the label management is &quot;to keep the integruity of the original vinyl issue&quot;, but is anyone really buying this? Shame on them!<br />The music on the &quot;Red&quot; album is of course stellar, that's not the point. Maybe it's too soon yet after the &quot;1&quot; compilation, but hasn't the time come for a definitve 2CD compilation of the Beatles, along the lines of, say, &quot;The Essential Bob Dylan&quot;, maximising the capability of 80 min. of a CD?
B00005YU1O|2.0|Richard Linklater has made some good movies and I appreciate what he's trying to do here, but the film was downright excruciating to watch. I can't imagine anyone finding it interesting, but apparently, many do. Maybe Philosophy itself just bores me. I did think the animation was cool, and the Ethan Hawke, Julie Delpy Before Sunrise scene was inspired, otherwise, this film is better left on the shelf. It is definitely not for all tastes.
0783225857|5.0|'To Kill A Mockingbird' is of course the movie adaptation of Harper Lee's movie with the same title. Gregory Peck is a lawyer in rural Mississippi who is asked to defend a black man accused of raping a white woman.<br />The movie starts however with a seemingly unrelated event, the lives of Atticus Finch's two children. His daughter is a tomboy and his son is trying to keep her from getting into more trouble. The stumble upon some strange items and look at the house of a strange man called Boo Radley.<br />Then the movie goes into the court case. It is of course very obvious that the black man is innocent, but this is 1930's South with an all white jury...<br />Then the two parts of the movie come back together again...<br />The acting in this movie (in black and white) is superb. I recall that Gregory Pecks perfomance was voted the best of the century. Even the little girl is superb, she even got a nominatation for an oscar. Boo Radley is played by Robert Duvall, though he says next to nothing and is only in the movie for a few minutes. He of course 10 years later would play Tom Hayden in The Godfather. For Star Trek fans: Tom Robinson, the black man accused, is Sisko's Father of DS9
B0001AVZA8|3.0|This is a fun and cute comedy with a great cast and beautiful scenery, but it drags on WAY too long, and ultimately ends up as an unmemorable waste of 2 plus hours. I know I would have liked it more had it been about 20 minutes shorter. Either way, this is worth seeing for fans of Diane Keaton, who just sparkles. Jack Nicholson is his usual self, but I LOVE Amanda Peet and Frances McDormand, who unfortunately, aren't given much to do. Keanu Reeves is less irritating than in his other films and luckily, has a small role. I'm glad I saw this, but it is way overhyped by critics. The usual formulaic Hollywood romance, only this time, the ones who fall in love are old.
B00005JKC3|2.0|I am still not sure what to think of this movie. Let's look at some aspects.<br />Acting: no really worth mentioning, except maybe Nick Nolte.<BR>SFXs: The Hulk is of course a fantastic piece of special effects. It's hard to believe it's entirely CGI.<BR>Dialogue: Even Star Wars is better<BR>Believability: Jumping for miles? going into space? no seriously, the old hulk was in some strange way believable.<br />Not a good movie, think I'm gonna watch Lee's 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' again. That movie still blows me away. The Hulk certainly did not.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|After being intrigued(or subliminially influenced, which ever came first) by the seven million commercials I saw for the release of the DVD, I felt an absolute need to see it.  I realized while the movie was starting that I didn't really want to see it;I was sure the story would be lame, and the whole premise would fall horribly short.  Not to mention that Ashton Kutcher was in it.  Once upon a time I was able to stomach him, but then came the overexposure, and it was just too much.  But I watched it, and i was surprised to find that it was very good.  As long as you're not looking for a completely realistic story line, you will probably enjoy it.  The DVD offers two different versions-Directors Cut and Theatrical Realease and is loaded with other extras.
B00005A1PR|4.0|India Arie Simpson made her debut in March of 2001, around the same time as Alicia Keys made her debut. At the Grammies that year, fans of India Arie were stunned when, despite her seven nominations for her debut &quot;Acoustic Soul&quot;, India Arie did not receive a single Grammy and many of her fans dislike Alicia Keys for &quot;robbing&quot; India of her Grammies. India Arie was twenty-five at the time of this debut and she, as far as I know, either wrote or co-wrote every song on this album. As well, I believe India Arie herself played the acoustic guitar in many (or all) of the songs. Though her lyrics are somewhat simple, they have a generally elegant kind of simplicity as well. On her debut, India seems to be introducing the listener both to herself and her style and she pulls it off quite well.      The album starts off with a short &quot;Intro&quot; in which India lists some of the artists who inspired her. It is quite short and not memorable. The first song on the album is India Arie's single &quot;Video&quot; in which she asserts that she's &quot;not the average girl from the video.&quot; In this song, India seems to be giving the listener a little insight as to what she's like as a person as well as giving us a taste of her lyrical and vocal style. The vocals in the bridge of the song are especially great (the part that begins &quot;am I any less of me if I don't wear pantyhose?&quot;). Though this is different from most singles in 2001, it is a wonderful song and a great introduction to India Arie. Afterwards comes &quot;Promises&quot;, one of the catchiest songs on the album. To me, this is one of the best songs on the album. In this song, India gives the messages that &quot;a man's only as good as his word&quot; and basically, to keep your promises and you will be rewarded.       Next comes two decent songs, &quot;Brown Skin&quot; and &quot;Strength, Courage and Wisdom&quot;. By decent I mean that they are still good but not quite up to the same level as other songs. &quot;Brown Skin&quot; is a touching song about how India Arie loves her man's brown skin. The only downside is the song is quite long and the lyrics are somewhat repetitive making it seem even longer. &quot;Strength, Courage and Wisdom&quot; is a little more upbeat and talks about finding these three qualities inside you. It is a decent enough song but is not quite as good as other songs on the album. After comes the slightly more interesting &quot;Nature&quot; with its captivating chorus and vocal style. This song showcases India's vocals quite well even though the lyrics contain a lot of similes and are not the best. Overall, it is a good song.      Next come three of my favourite songs on the album, &quot;Back To The Middle&quot;, &quot;Ready For Love&quot; and &quot;Always In My Head&quot;, though they are interrupted by an interlude. &quot;Back To The Middle&quot; has great vocals and the lyrics seem to be a little bit autobiographical. The music in this track, like with all the tracks on the album now that I think of it, fits with the vocals and lyrics very well. It is not exactly clear what &quot;back to the middle&quot; means but that does not take away from the quality of the song. In &quot;Ready For Love&quot;, India states that she is ready for all the pain, joy and time involved in love. The song is a calm ballad that grows increasingly more powerful as it goes on and shows off the sandiness of India's voice. To me, it is a definite highlight. After that comes a short interlude which is mostly a continuation of the intro. In other words, its nothing too memorable. &quot;Always In My Head&quot;, like several India Arie songs, contains a lot of metaphors but this time is works well. The music in this song it awesome as well.      Next comes &quot;I See God In You&quot;, which could have been extremely cheesy or wonderful. Thankfully, it is closer to the latter. The song mostly repeats the chorus with only two real verses, but India's voice and the catchiness of the song save it from being too cheesy. Afterwards come another three decent tracks, &quot;Simple&quot;, &quot;Part of My Life&quot; and &quot;Beautiful&quot;. &quot;Simple&quot; has a catchy beat to it but suffers from average lyrics. The vocals in the chorus sound great though I think there's a little too much of the background singers in the chorus. However, it does sound pretty good. &quot;Part of My Life&quot; is decent but not nearly as good as some of the other tracks on the album. It suffers from subpar to average lyrics that do not do India Arie's talents much justice. &quot;Beautiful&quot; truly lives up to its name, particularly in the chorus. However, while &quot;Beautiful&quot; is good, it is not quite as good as other songs on the album. Finally, we come to the Outro and the bonus track, &quot;Wonderful&quot; which is a dedication to Stevie Wonder. The Outro is basically a &quot;thank you&quot; song to India's family. &quot;Wonderful&quot; is somewhat cheesy but is still a nice dedication to Stevie Wonder. Despite its good lyrics and great vocals, the song just seems to be lacking something.      Overall Mark: 4/5      Overall, India Arie comes out with a wonderful RnB/Soul debut album that touches on many topics that are not generally talked about in modern music. Despite the quality of the album, I do not think it would be one that many people will remember several years down the road simply because now, three years after this albums release, very few people even remember India Arie as more than &quot;the one who sang Video&quot;. This is really a shame since India Arie is an undeniably talented artist. Unfortunately, her sophomore album wasn't nearly at the same level as her debut. This album is great to add to any collection.
B000002UAU|2.0|... because while the beginning and end of Sgt. Pepper is good, the valley in between is very wide.  It's as if the producer put the weakest songs (Mr. Kite and Within You Without You) exactly in the middle of the track listing. Beatle fans make excuses for them such as &quot;they are different&quot; or &quot;if you listen to it 10 times it starts to get not so bad&quot;...but they are weak...
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I don't know why there are so many haters that say that this album is crap.......probably 90% of you havent even listened to it ..so...dont say noting if you havent even listened to it......this album is great....
B000002UAX|2.0|Not that everything before it is great, but once you get past Yer Blues on the second disk you can turn this off.
0316168815|5.0|First of all...just FYI to everyone...I am a 14 year old GUY and I BAWLED MY EYES OUT multiple times while reading this book.  You know what I absolutely hate?  Narrow minded people...who seem to take the ending entirely the wrong way.  Don't think about it being paranormal or being science fiction...JUST TRUST YOUR HEART.  Miss Sebold invokes the true spirit of the human heart in every angle of this book.  BROADEN YOUR MINDS!  Don't sit there and dissect the book as if it were come kind of frog on your high school science classroom table...LOOK AT IT AS A WHOLE...A BEAUTIFUL, TOUCHING WORK OF ART.  The end is not meant to reek of ghosts but it is a story of LOVE and LIFE...and the choice that Ruth makes...it's all about LOVE.  This book is amazing and I encourage EVERYONE to disregard the bad reviews these stupid narrow-minded critics have given it.  Oh...and I would like to comment on the person who said the title was unnecessary...It is actually perfect for the book.  The Lovely Bones are, as Susie explains towards the end of trhe book, all of the chocies and links that her friends and family made in the wake of her death...that may have not happened if she hadn't died...it is how she is alive on earth still, through those connections...PLEASE READ THIS BOOK IT IS ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING I HAVE EVER READ!!!!!!!
B000002UDB|1.0|&quot;Mind altering music&quot;....yeah sure, believe what you want.  And exactly what is the &quot;phycadelia&quot; regarding I Am the Walrus?  One of the worst albums of 1967. Easily.
B0000020C4|5.0|Recorded LIVE in 1995 at the Royal Albert Hall to celebrate 10 years of marvelous success, this album showcases some of the best voices from the original London Cast (Wilkinson, Armstrong, Ball), Broadway Cast (Maguire, Salonga, Kuhn), and other marvelous voices from other casts (Ruthie Henshall from a later London cast and Phillip Quast from Australia!).  What you will notice about this recording is the wonderful sound quality and the wonderful voice acting and singing.  The orchestra is marvelous.  The company is wonderful.<br />Colm Wilkinson is basically the only recorded Valjean besides Gary Morris, so Wilkinson is recognized as the best Valjean out there.  Who knows, there may be a better voice out there, but the poor man isn't recorded!  Just joking around.  He has a strong voice and is convincing as a Valjean,  You can hear his frustration, his anger, and his pain in his voice when he sings.  Phillip Quast is marvelous as Javert.  Mann is a good Javert, and so is the one on the London Cast (is his name Roger Alam or something like that?), but Quast just has an AMAZING voice!  It is strong and has much expression in it.  Javert sounds ticked off in some parts, and tortured in others.  You really can feel for Quast's Javert.  Ruthie Henshall is my favorite Fantine because of the quality of her voice.  The young Cosette is very professional and adorable.  The Thenardiers are perfect, both evil and hilarious at the same time!  Adam Searles is a good Gavroche, but not my favorite.  I prefer the Gavroche on the CSR.  Kuhn is beautiful as Cosette, and Ball is a great Marius.  Salonga is a great Eponine- she shows the desperation, anger, and hopelessness of Eponine.  Maguire is an excellent Enjolras.  People do not realize that Maguire had not sung the part in years and was asked only less than a week before the concert was held to be in it, so you can understand why he may have been rusty on hitting some of the notes.  Plus this CD is live.  If Warlow made any mistake on CSR you can't tell because they fix it with machines.  That's why voices are so flawless on CDs! But this is a live recording.  I think he had a lot of energy and a lot of gusto.  I love this recording!  The only problem I have is that they cut out some of the major parts of the musical.  They cut &quot;Lovely Ladies&quot; in half, they don't have &quot;the robbery&quot; that would explain what the song &quot;stars&quot; is all about, and they cut &quot;Eponine's Errand&quot; (little he knows, little he sees....&quot;).  Many of the battle songs are cut out, including Gavroche's death.  It would have been nice if they had the entire musical on it!  I love it anyway!
B000002J09|1.0|Bombastic and pretentious.  The obnoxious Robert Plant shrieks, sometimes off tune.  Jimmy Page's solos are often sloppy (and why does he sound so much better on recordings than live - a lot of overdubbing perhaps?)  And the lyrics: &quot;Someone tells me there's a girl out there with love in her eyes and flowers in her hair.&quot;  &quot;And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune then the piper will lead us to reason, and a new day will dawn for those who stand long and the forest will echo with laughter.&quot;  Ugh. You can almost smell the incense wafting by.  And meanwhile, Stairway to Heaven stands ready to be played the 109,003,305,893th time on the radio just in case you missed it the first billion times and aren't dead of boredom.
B00004TH83|4.0|You never can tell who's going to be a hit with the public and who isn't. Lara Fabian has an incredible voice and isn't bad looking either. She's a star in Canada and Europe but most folks here don't even know her name. This album was supposed to be her introduction to America but it failed. Why? Who knows? The songs are a pleasant blend of power ballads and pop which was quite popular at the time. My only small nitpick is that Lara didn't sound like she was really comfortable singing in English. It sounds a little like she had no idea what the lyrics actually meant. <br />So, is this album worth buying? Yeah sure if you love Celine Dion or Mariah Carey (before she got hooked on Hip Hop) and you want lush, romantic music. It's a mystery why Lara caught on here. I'm hoping the studio bosses will give another try.
0743454529|5.0|Having lost a 4 year old child to cancer over 19 years ago, I usually don't read stories about the death of a child. Having lived through that painful part of my life, I could write the book and don't need to  read about others. However, Jodi Picoult is one of my favorite authors------I read all her books. And I'm very glad I read this one--in spite of the sobbing at the end. I was told our tears are salt water-----for cleansing. And now I'm totally cleansed. :)<BR>I was so shocked by the twist at the end-----and  yet it was something of a \\"divine intervention\\" for Anna to save Kate. I think the family was already gearing up for losing a daughter--just quite surprised by which one would die.<BR>I loved the way the author told this story by using the different characters to narrate----allowing the reader to get to know each person's perspective on the ordeal. There was a sense of humor with Anna's attorney and also Julia and her sister. There was a sense of fun along with the cancer story, hospital stays, pain, illness, the court room and then the trememdous loss.I was cheering for Jesse----hoping he would be a success someday---glad she gave him a purpose in life.<BR>I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about real people and the trials of life. Nobody has a perfect life----and there are more familes with similar stories than any of us want to know. Not every family, however, creates a genetically \\"perfect\\" donor for a child------but it has been done in the past.And I'm sure it will be an event of the future.<BR>In spite of going thru a box of kleenex, this was a non-stop page turner---------a great read.
B0001Z52RU|3.0|If I am refering to this as ans AWESOME MOVIE, you may ask yourself why did I only give the DVD 3 stars. Well, I'll tell you why. Because the alternate ending was absolutely the DUMBEST scenerio that they could have dreamt up. It's the type of thing that a writer should have been fired for even suggesting when they were coming up with potential endings. Otherwise, this is a great flick, despite the fact that it may have been better with a more dramatic young actor than Kutcher, perhaps Chris Klein or the guy from The Ring. No matter how powerful the story may be, all I see is Kelso going back in time.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|The problem with 'The Matrix Revolutions' is that it is not a complete film in itself.  It is the concluding chapter to 'The Matrix Reloaded'.  Both films together make up a great addition to the first film 'The Matrix', but on their own they are simply lacking.  Part 3 is lacking much more than part two because 'Revolutions' has few more surprises and mostly resolves the story of the three films in a concluding act that has been bloated out to an entire film.  The conclusion to this series is totally valid, it is simply far too long.  The Wachowski Bros. should have made one long second film instead of dragging out the series into an unessicary third film film.
B00008J4P5|2.0|You can tell from a couple of songs that they have talent and are good songwriters, but I think they have much more capability. It can get dull. They could play better on their instruments, and you cannot have that good of a band with just a guitar and a drumset. You don't have to get new members but at least create some kind of diversity with changing styles and maybe adding instruments once in awhile.
0385336810|3.0|Although I love the Shopaholic series, I just couldn't get into reading about Emma as well as I could get into reading about Rebecca Bloomwood. I read the each of the Shopaholic books in 2 days max., but I couldn't stay interested in this one for more than 30 minutes at a time. The plot is similar to that of &quot;Confessions of a Shopaholic&quot; (ie- office girl in debt falls for rich boss) but it lacked the humor and in depth look at the characters. The story is a bit drawn out and lacking that &quot;something&quot; that makes you want to know what happens between Jack and Emma. Random attempts at creating tension (ie- the fight that ends the first date) are bland and are hardly believable.<br />Despite its flaws, I enjoyed reading this book. It's not something I would read over and over like I do the other series, but it's worth one read. But I would have to say Kinsella's &quot;Shopaholic&quot; series is 10 times better!
B000002UA5|5.0|ummagumma the fourth double cd album was very underrated in my opinion and should have recieved a more favourable reviews than it got with excellent renditions of set the controls for the heart of the sun aand a saucerful of secrets.very highly recommended.
0061015725|3.0|I am a huge Michael Crichton fan, especially of his books.  They are much better stories than their movie counterparts (Jurassic Park is a perfect example of that).  However, his last few books have purely been written for the screen.  &quot;Prey&quot;, sadly, is no exception.<br />This story is about nanotechnology and how the creators get overrun by the monsters they create.  Like in most of Crichton's other books, it's very fast-paced supported by science that is somewhat controversial.  It begins very quickly and has few slow sections, especially if you are interested in nanotechnology.  However, it eventually slows down and ends anti-climactically.  The characters were flat and could not keep the story going once it reached its end.<br />Sadly, Crichton has written another book designed to become a movie screenplay.  If you read it as such, you may find it interesting.  It is fairly fast-paced and can be read in a few days.  However, if you're looking for a story to stand on its own merits without the underlying pretense of &quot;this is going to become a movie&quot;, then you'll be disappointed.
B000002U9W|5.0|this was yet another experimental album from floyd which in my humble opinion was also very much underrated and i still like it after owning this great cd after all these years.very highly recommended.
B00020HEL6|5.0|This is one of those stories you see in Hollywood movies, only this time is for real!! The producers of one of countless insignificant sitcoms realized that their kid actress had an incredible singing voice and a penchant for jazz. It didn't take long for Renee to switch from performing in a mediocre sitcom to enchanting jazz audiences with her SUPERB voice. When I first heard her debut album, I was floored. I know a lot of jazz singers and mostly wanna-be jazz singers but this is one of those very rare talents that only appear once every decade or so. It's refreshing to see that the so-called &quot;new talents&quot; aren't only the idiots who participate to that monstrosity called &quot;American Idol&quot; and that a 15 year old girl not only can have a voice THAT mature but can also be as intellingent as to choose a much more sophisticated and appropriate repertoire for her incredible voice. Brava Renee, I'm sure we will hear a lot more of you in the future. Hail to the next Diana Krall!!!
B000002UAX|5.0|as i have said this is one of the finest beatles cd and you will thank me after buying it i assure you.buy it.five stars.
B00006CXSS|5.0|It's a great piece of work....I have nothing to add to the other comments.<br /><br />However, do note that I received mine with a faulty disc and could not veiw Episode 4.  Seems this is a wide-spread problem with this set.  Amazon quickly sent me a new set, so props to them for the customer service.  When you get this, check all episodes immediately.
B000148KK2|1.0|I bought this CD last night. I am still depressed and &quot;empty&quot; after hearing it. I cannot remember when I felt more distanced and &quot;removed&quot; by a big selling CD I have purchased. This has been heavily promoted by Verve records and reviewers who love anything Elvis Costello does, since his influence is thick on this release. They say he is a &quot;great song writer&quot;, yet before getting this album, I could not name a single song he had ever written, much less was known for. I listened to this CD 4 times and the more I tried to get something out of it, the more bewildered I became.<br />At this point, I want to state here that I loved her CDs of &quot;The Look of Love&quot; and &quot;Live in Paris&quot; with full orchestra. They are full of texture and her voice, though limited in range, was fascinating... and that big, bold beefy sound really added to the wonderful and romantic mood of the albums. There is nothing &quot;syrupy&quot; about first class woodwinds, strings, brass and big-league percussion if a singer has voice and personality strong enough not to be overwhelmed by it. Natalie Cole, Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Rosemary Clooney, Judy Garland, Monica Mancini, all have recordings with that big orchestra sound and those recordings are memorable, powerful and extrodinarily musical. That magnificent sound will never go out of style, either for great singers or truly great motion picture soundtracks, for that matter. It will evolve and develop in new ways with innovative singers and arrangers.  <br />What I heard last night was something else entirely, though. &quot;The Girl in the Other Room&quot; is a new direction for Krall. No big orchestra, just a small combo backing her voice and piano. Her voice is unlike any of her previously consistant and terrific albums. It's a very SMALL sound. NOT intimate... just small, personal, self-absorbed and introverted both musically and lyrically. I am speaking of the original songs she has penned with Elvis Costello, which comprise the bulk of this collection. Through these songs she is giving her fans sadness, complaints and bitterness (as though we need to feel sorry for her and have never had our own tragedies to get through). <br />Musically, Krall's songs have very little melody and what little melody there is gets little singing from Krall here. It would be more accurate to say they are &quot;vocalized&quot; and &quot;half-spoken&quot;, as though she's too timid to open up her voice and release the sadness contained in the rambling and esoteric lyrics. One doesn't get the impression she has any hope to confront or resolve her bitterness and there is only regret and resignation ahead. In these songs she does not ask for any help either, not in the lyrics, nor in the tone of her voice. It is consistantly timid and withdrawn in character.<br />Diana's &quot;new and improved&quot; throaty and &quot;smokey&quot; voice (which often sounds an imitation of Joni Mitchell) seems to reaffirm this resignation.  These songs portray a &quot;girl&quot; who is saddened by the process of life she has never had to confront before. Maturity will get a person through the toughest tragedy through power, strength, passion, tenderness, love and emotion and many singers have sung with these aspects in mind, thereby allowing us, the listener, to relate and to and empethize with the song.... this &quot;girl&quot; only speaks of self-pity in these passive &quot;anthems of resignation.&quot; We are hyped to believe the &quot;Girl in the Other Room&quot; is somehow Diana's &quot;other side&quot; and is more of what her &quot;inner feelings&quot; are about. Well, Diana is not a &quot;girl&quot;, she is a 39 year old woman and this does not sound like the Diana I know and it sounds very artificial and &quot;put on.&quot;<br />With dozens of other powerful, triumphant, bluesy, romantic, rockin', swingin', magnificent, melodic and glorious singers out there with truly superb albums in release, I am sorry I spent any time and good money on this sad boring and depressing mess.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|I'd just like to express my opinion about the movie - I think it's a groundbreaking classic that should truly be appreciated... and I'd also like to say to *somebody* : If u dont like the movie, Y spam the page up with like 5 reviews by the same person all saying the same exact thing ... and repeating themselves... ???

B00005JMUA|5.0|If you have seen Volume 1 and you enjoyed it, then I highly recommend Volume 2.  While Vol. 2 has much less violence than the first movie, Tarantino treats the audience to character development which makes the final scene between Beatrix Kiddo and Bill all the more potent.  Along with the tension at the end, Tarantino gives the audience some hysterical moments such as Kiddo's training with the White Lotus.<br />And besides, what would your collection be if you owned Vol. 1 but not Vol. 2?
B000002VMH|5.0|After being a part of Eurythmics, Annie Lennox created her first solo album, Diva.  She is truly a diva, musically far above the rest.<br />The good: Every song has that unforgettable &quot;Lennox touch&quot;.  Some songs, such as Why, Stay By Me, and Cold are calm, relaxing songs.  Songs like Walking On Broken Glass, Little Bird, and Legend In My Living Room have catchy lyrics, a good, strong beat, and a nice rhythm.<br />The bad: I fell in love with these songs so much that I over-listened to it.  Don't follow in my footsteps, please.<br />I feel Diva was a wonderful transition between Eurythmics and Annie's solo career.  You definitely won't be disappointed when you buy this CD.
1400032717|1.0|Actually I don't think it deserves even one star. Our Book Club read this book and not one member gave it much praise.  It is a painful book to read.  I am not sure why anyone would read it pr for that matter why anyone would waste time writing it  It is narrated by the main character, a 15 year old boy who has autism.  It is like listening to someone sing in a monotone.  Read a medical book to learn about autism. Not one of our members really even wanted to finish the book.  Would definitely not recommend it to anyone except maybe my worst enemy.
B0001KZM3O|3.0|&quot;The Final Cut&quot; is not for you if you are searching for &quot;quintessential&quot; Pink Floyd. This album finds Roger Waters in complete creative control of the band (at this point a trio due to Richard Wright's expulsion). David Gilmour's solos are few and frequently far between, and Waters' brooding lyrics are clearly the centerpiece of this melancholy work. Imagine the &quot;sedate&quot; parts of &quot;The Wall&quot; (i.e. &quot;Nobody Home&quot; and the beginning of &quot;One of My Turns&quot;) and you have nearly the entire &quot;Final Cut&quot; (with the exception of &quot;Not Now John&quot;.) The effect is that the music is a texture, rather than a discernible melody, and sometimes this is great (as in &quot;the final cut&quot;) However, it sometimes makes the music sound fabricated and unoriginal (&quot;Behind Paranoid Eyes&quot;). Overall, I believe it to be a great collector's item, but not a &quot;must-have&quot; for fans of the pre- &quot;Wall&quot; Pink Floyd.
B00005M91K|5.0|Baraka is a visual feast like no other, a film that begs to be seen on the largest screen possible so the viewer can absorb the grandiose feel of the images.  This is the type of film that IMAX was made for.  Filmed on a 70mm camera in a total of 24 countries, it is a dialogue-free film that takes the viewer around the globe into uncharted lands.  The first half of the film shows us the natural beauty of earth as we are shown striking images of mountain ranges, deserts, tropical rain forests, volcanoes, solar temples, exotic animals. The whole thing is done to the tune of a spellbinding soundtrack of ambient music, Gregorian chants, flutes and other exotic sounds by world music artists such as Harmonic Choir and Dead Can Dance.<br />But Baraka is much more than just National Geographic for the visually inclined.  Its purpose is to give us a view of the world good and bad.  And as the second half of the film unwinds, the tone of Baraka becomes increasingly dark and pessimistic as we are exposed to some of the harsh realities of the world like homelessness, poverty, slave labour, hunger.  Horrifying images of tree-chopping, sweatshops, subway-cramming in Tokyo and scenes in a chicken factory will make many cringe and think twice about eating chicken for a while.  But sometimes even within these backdrops of despair can be found things that are beautiful such as the joy and happiness on children's faces despite growing up in poverty-stricken 2nd world countries.  These kids grow up with practically no material possessions yet they seem so HAPPY, much happier than kids of first-world countries who grow up with any material object their heart desires.<br />Baraka is certainly not the kind of film we are used to seeing.  I struggled with it for the first 10 minutes or so but then immediately fell under its spell and forgot that I was watching a film with no dialogue.  Sometimes it's nice to be able to flick off the brain, not worry about following a story and just let oneself be absorbed by what's on screen, and that's what this film does.  The only minor squabbles I had were the absence of writing on the screen to let us know where in the world we are and that the film did peter out a little towards the end.  Baraka is a film worth purchasing that will stand well to multiple viewings and might even make some think twice about where their real priorities ought to be.oneself be absorbed by what's on screen, and that's what this film does.

B00003CXCT|5.0|Man, I've been waiting for years for Star Wars on DVD (other than the bootleg non-special edition DVDs from Asia, which everyone crying about the special editions is free to order ...).  I like special editions - they are cleaned up, brought up to date technologically, remastered, and typically include bonus footage.  I'm eager to see this one.<br />If you don't like special editions, I've got two words for you:  Fast Forward
0062515675|2.0|I thought that the anonymous review dated March 18 was most accurate. This book is a trite recitation of recycled wisdom.  Sharma's verve and syntax is not compelling, and serves only to string together these old ideas. His attempt to mix a modern context to timeless truths went amiss. In the end we learn that most of us have denied ourselves our true calling, and long for a way to get paid to do what we cherish the most. We are spiritually lazy and are responsible for our destiny. I ask when will someone tell the story of a frustrated middleclass artist that always dreamed of becoming an accountant.<br />Notwithstanding my tentative reading, something happened half way through the book, as I was diligently trying to push back the reviewer's goading perspicacious comments. I realized that that is all there is. That there will not be any book that proffers the ultimate panacea, the answer to life's riddles and the chart to  bliss.  We will have to write our own.  And that the unintended consequence of my frustration with Sharma's prose was to force me to find value in his words. And I did.  And in the end that is all what this good prophet set out to do. It was a good exercise. Many others have made it much easier..

B00008973A|3.0|Considering I have never seen the Broadway show, I found this movie to be quite enjoyable. The songs were fun, the dancing fantastic, the acting was relatively good, and I thought the plot would have been very good without the Cassie/Zach relationship being thrust into the limelight. Many people did not like &quot;Surprise, Surprise,&quot; due to its replacing of an original song. However, I thought Gregg Burge did an absolutely amazing job with it. His dancing was so high-energy and almost technically impeccable. No complaints there. I loved: &quot;Dance Ten, Looks Three&quot;, &quot;Nothing&quot;, &quot;Hello Twelve&quot;, and &quot;At the Ballet.&quot; My one major complaint with this movie is Cassie. I felt she was annoying, she detracted from several of the musical numbers with absolutely pointless shots of her sitting in a chair, and I didn't enjoy her songs very much. Other than that, good movie, and hopefully I will get to see the Broadway show sometime.
B0000027FQ|3.0|I don't like Udo Dirkschneider's voice. I think his voice is a useless piece of trash that helped to keep Accept away from the success they deserved, mainly magic guitarrist Wolf Hoffmann, a man capable of creating incredible beatuiful and melodic leads and riffs from his Jackson Flying V even playing some of the hardest and heaviest songs of that period (78-85). Anyway, ACCEPT's music was so good that you ended getting used to Udo's voice anyhow.<br />This live album lacks fire, but is is a good compilation of their best work. Buy it at your own risk.
0156027321|2.0|So often I read with amazement reviews of second rate books, like this one, that are so highly touted by professional reviewers and the reading public.<br />This book, although it might be amusing for some readers, is far from deserving the praise it has recieved. Let me tell you why.<br />The intellectual level is low. The book doesn't offer anything but the simplest and undeveloped level of thinking about life. The author is not widely read enough, and/or educated. The research here, if you can call it that, is sparse and smattering. The author acts like he's done his homework by offering us a thumbnail sketch of life in zoo's which he's gleaned from a couple of books. His attempts at creating a foreign environment, and culture, are more like a travel log approach than anything more substantial; the same for his comparitive knowledge of world religions which sounds like it was gotten out of an encyclopedia.<br />The lead in to the main tale is tedious,unastute,and worth skipping, that's as far as I got. I wasn't convinced that things were going to get any better. In all, an eminently forgetable work.
0451191153|5.0|Ayn Rand brings to light a side of humanity that is often overlooked.  America is a stage for countless players described as second - handers.  Thank God for those people with passion and convictions.  You could be a Roark.  This book is a capitalist's survival tool.  It is your responsibility to yourself to use it and benefit from the insights it contains. Learn from the mistakes of the villains.  This book could have used a better editor (typos, missing words, etc.), however in essence it contains many perceivable truths.  After you're done, you'll realize you could have spent all that time creating something instead of loafing around and reading.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I was shocked to absolutely love this movie! I have never been a fan of Ashton Kutcher, sure he has his moments but he has never proven to be a great actor. Until now. He gives a solid and intense dramatic performance in The Butterfly Effect, and my opinon of him as an actor has completley changed. This film is by far one of the best I have seen in the past year. It starts off with a bang and just keeps going and will pull you in to the very end. The film revolves around a guy who can go back and altar past events in his childhood in order to create a better life for him and his friends. There are some very disturbing moments in the film. One scene to intense for me to watch, but it made the film all the more compelling. Amy Smart also proves she is a wonderful diverse actress, as Ashtons love interest in the film. <BR>The ending was probably the best and worst part of the film, and I did not see it coming. Finally, a film that does not give the audience a happy ending. The ending is heartbreaking, but perfect.Highly recommended.
0618526412|3.0|This book is very depressing. I kept reading it because I was sure it had to get better.  Life is to short and the world is to full of great reads to spend time with this one.  The message that a great life depends on ourselves and not others can be found in a lot of inspiring books.  One doesn't need to get depressed to get this message.  In fact, one could get so down , one could miss the message.
B000089CJI|5.0|Wow what a great album. Benjamin Gibbard is one of my favorite artists of all time, so I bought this with high hopes. I had never heard of Tamborello, but hey, my focus was Gibbard. When I first listened to it, i really did try to keep an open mind, and then I ended up hating it. About a month later, I popped it in again after listening to every single Death Cab for Cutie album, and all of a sudden i was tapping my feet and flipping through the lyric book rapidly. How could i have ever thought this bad??!!<br />As always Gibbard delivers with sharp, smart, and epic lyrics, turning what is obviously small events into the most important thing the world. The electronica takes some getting used to, but by the time you get past it, you see how perfect with the melancholic perfection of Gibbard.<br />The standout tracks are #2, Such Great Heights, all for its lyrics, &quot;i am thinking its a sign that the freckles in our eyes are mirror images and when we kiss they're perfectly aligned; #4, which is a duet played out like a tense and pleading conversation between Gibbard and a girl who is leaving him; and #8, This Place is a Prison, which is an extremely mournful song rife with touching lyrics. <br />All in all a brilliant and lasting album.
B00005JNA2|5.0|First off, I must say that I LOVED BEFORE SUNRISE and was absolutely thrilled to hear that there was going to be a sequel.      Although, I didn't think that a sequel could possilbly live up to the magic of the first. But I was absolutely wrong.  This movie may possibly be a better film than the first (ask me again in nine years and it may move from possibly to most definately). I loved every minute of this movie.  Even Delpy's songs. This movie contains one of the most gut-wrenching and achingly romantic exhanges that I have ever seen. The movie is absolutely beautiful and the ending is frustrating and annoyingly perfect.  This is no tiffany-wrapped hollywood ending, but a question of faith.  It remains a litmus test of what type of (romantic) person you are. <br />So BEFORE SUNRISE fans (like myself), this is the movie that you've been waiting nine years to see.  Julie Delpy's Celine has matured into an even more amazingly beautiful woman.  The kind of woman many of us hope to be.  Ethan Hawke's Jesse has lost some of his pseudo-intellectual-gen-X-slacker cynacism that pervades the first film (But hey, it was the mid 90s.  Weren't all 20something-year old males required to sport both a goatee and a healthy dose of cynacism?) So while these characters have grown and changed, they are still the same two people we fell in love with in Vienna.<br />  Those of you who haven't seen the first film will still be able to enjoy this film.  However, I highly recommend that you rent the BEFORE SUNRISE before seeing BEFORE SUNSET so that you can truly enjoy the flow of conversation instead of trying to acquaint yourself with these characters.  This movie was truly made for the fans of the first film.  I can't give this movie enough stars. <br /> I've heard that Mr. Linkater, Hawke and Delpy are interested in doing another sequel to this film. I must say that I agree with one of the earlier reviewers: DON'T MAKE ANOTHER FILM UNLESS CELINE + JESSE ARE LIVING HAPPILY AND NEUROTICALLY EVER AFTER!!! <br /> <BR>I have to stop gushing about the cinematic orgasm that is BEFORE SUNSET. Just watch and enjoy.<br />P.S. JESSE- I hope you missed your flight.
B00008MNYS|5.0|I have listened to this CD over and over.  I don't think there is one song that I don't absolutely love.  Of course I like some more than others, but they are all very well written and performed.  Great lyrics.  Great music period.  I'll definitely buy more and more Robbie Williams!
078681859X|5.0|\\"The Amulet Of Samarkand\\" is a truly great novel, filled with adventure, mystery, mysticism, and... humor! Jonathan Stroud brings his magic touch to a modern-day London run by wizards and over-run by demons.  \\"The Amulet Of Samarkand\\" is one of those books that truly takes you out of your skin and plants you right in the story, sort of like the \\"scrying discs\\" in his book, you feel you're there, going through everything with the characters.  Every aspect of this book is great, but it's the little things that make a book great, and Jonathan Stroud clearly understands this.<br />Firstly, the footnotes inserted in the chapters narrated by Bartimaeus (the leading demon in the story) were genius, witty, and gut-wrenchingly funny.  He gave Bartimaeus an attitude filled with wit and wisdom at the same time.  What's so great about the characters in this book, is that it feels the two main characters reverse position.  The boy, Nathaniel, is actually difficult to like, whereas the demon in the story becomes the most beloved personality.  <br />I can't wait for the next book in \\"The Bartimaeus Trilogy\\".  Keep it up Jonathan Stroud!  You're books are great.  I recommend this book for people of all ages (excluding perhaps young children).  You won't be disappointed.
B00002ND77|5.0|...is the best way to describe Malcolm X, Denzel Washinton's greatest work in cinema so far. It tells the story of Malcolm X, the strong-willed black revolution leader whose ironic and powerful views differed very differently from Martin Luther Jr.<BR>Denzel Washington gives an extraordinary performance, and with heart he shows the metamorphosis of Malcolm X, from hip young kid, to his life of crime days, to when he was a white-hating civil rights leader.<BR>There are many other great performances in the film, and Spike Lee makes Malcolm X his best &quot;joint&quot; ever. You can feel that this is a Spike lee film, because it is a little strange and it swings from one mood to another. Spike lee also stars in the film, but as a minor character.<BR>I thoroughly enjoyed watching Malcolm X, and it ranks as one of the best film of the '90s. If you love Denzel Washington, you haven't seen him perform until you have seen him in Malcolm X.
B0002858YS|5.0|Got my first fix of The Killers earlier this year.  Saw them live and wanted more, so I pre-ordered the CD.  Arrived a day before it was to be released.  I was excited.  Pressed PLAY to listen and haven't stopped since.  'Hot Fuss' is crazy addictive; I have friends who've picked up their own copy and are got just as addicted.  There's something in the music, call it new w/ an old sound, whatever floats your boat.  But you will most definitely enjoy.<br />This is by far the best debut album I've ever heard.  Really.  It's damn near perfect!!! Go ahead and give it 5 stars.  It is perfect.
B00005JKED|5.0|...is what you can call Training Day, the distrubing police epic starring Denzel Washington in an Oscar-winning performance.<BR>Denzel stars as Alonzo, a very corrupt cop playing both sides of the law. He doesn't resort to evidence, or jurys, or interrogations. He just packs brutal violence into his brand of law-making.<BR>Training day is about a young cop's training day, a day that will test if he is good enough material that can become an infamous narcotic officer. His mentor, and mental abuser, is Alonzo. During the day Alonzo sets Jake(Ethan Hawke)up, holds a gun to his head and forces him to use narcotics that destroy his mind, and he makes him assist in murder and robbery. Alonzo teses him, plays with his mind, and puts jake way over his boiling point.<BR>In the end, Alonzo ditches Jake with a gang of Mexican hitmen, leaves him for dead, and goes back to his wife(Eva Mendes) and their son.<BR>Jake finds Alonzo, chases him to a rooftop, and they battle for control over Alonzo's ground. It is a climatic battle of &quot;mentor&quot; and &quot;student&quot;.<BR>Training Day is brutal and disturbing to watch and digest. It will certainly make you think about the NARC squad, and will leave you feeling different than when you came in.
B000069CWE|4.0|I loved this CD, but bought it with totally different expectations. Half of the CD is absolutely amazing, and the other half is just rap/techno remixes with different artists which I find really annoying. Personally, I prefered the originals, but I love this CD because some of the songs are so unique and different. I hated this CD at first, but it's grown on me so much! My fave remixes are Points of Authority, With You, Crawling (Awesome at 5:40!!) and My December. If you're dissing this CD, remember remixes are always different and always have different beats. You will probably hate this CD if you hate remixes in general. This CD has a more techno and dance beat than the others.   <br />I listen to LP because it's different, and their lyrics are so awesome. If you listen closely, they make a lot of sense. As well as the fact that LP doesn't just fit in one specific category in Alternative (If that makes any sense).
B0001W8Q9Y|2.0|Finally... a new album from Marillion. I was very anxiously awaiting this album. I finally bought it and I sometimes wonder whether my expectations were just too high?<BR>MY favorite albums (AOS, Anorak, Clutching) still seem better than this one. I didn't quite like &quot;Map of the world&quot; previously and this album has many of those songs. I wonder if Marillion is taking a turn into a more mainstream direction??????<BR>A few songs are really old fashion Marillion but I really have to get used to a new Marillion. <br />I guess they are appealing to a much younger crowd...<BR>I'll wait for the next one. Long live Clutching at Straws!!!
B000060P79|2.0|This CD isn't bad, but I have to admit that they don't have the best of voices. They don't have a lot of talent, but they're an ok band.

B00008K9Z5|5.0|This is an amazing followup to Hybrid Theory! I like all the songs on it. &quot;Nobody's Listening&quot; is almost Hip Hop with a japanese flute in it and has a little more of a chorus. Very unique nonetheless. My other favorites are &quot;Don't Stay&quot;, &quot;Hit The floor&quot; and &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot;. I don't have any songs I dislike on here. This is definitely a MUST BUY!
0380002930|4.0|Delightful and enchanting story about a group of rabbits that leave their home in search of a more secure life. Of course they encounter myriad obstacles and adventures along the way, but the charm of the novel lies in its creation of a lapine culture, including a language and a story-telling custom. The rabbits ultimately end up in a struggle for their freedom and for the right to live in accordance with nature. I think you have to be a botanist to get through some of the descriptive paragraphs,which often read like a laundry list of trees and plants. Otherwise it's a very original and engaging story....A
078324228X|2.0|The story is about 15% factual. Carter was set free because of two alleged procedural errors, NOT because of new evidence. His resume was 27-12-1 - high point of his career was his 1st round TKO of former welter & middleweight champion, Emile Griffith. he didn't destroy the great Emile as depicted in the movie. The fight was stopped after 3 flash knockdowns. Griffith was never dangersouly hurt, he was caught cold & never regained his legs - due to the three knockdown rule, the fight was prematurely stopped.<br />Carter was a rough, tough, seasoned boxer, with slightly above average power, a decent mandible & average hand/foot speed. He struggled against slick styled boxer's that were defensive gurus - movement off angles, stylists and great side-to-side movement. Carter would literally give up when outclassed in the ring - ie. the Joey Giardello and Luis Rodriguez fights. The Giardello fight is one of the key elements of the movie. In the movie, Carter pounds on Giardello for 15 rounds & then gets outrageously robbed of the decision by a racist conspiracy by boxing's powers that be. Joey Giardello - foolishly portrayed as a racist in the film - beat Carter as convincingly as Nigerian Dick Tiger did - both beat Carter like a drum.<br />Carter's main weapon was sheer intimidation. He looked as bad (mean) as Sonny Liston, but when he was about to do battle with someone who wasn't intimidated, Carter simply had problems - not to mention he was easily outboxed. USA Today described Rubin Carter as, \\"A true folk hero\\" & a \\"warrior scholar\\" - obviously the public seemed to be buying the movies hook, line & sinker. The fact is, Carter was never a world champion and clearly lost to every upper echelon fighter he fought. Though wrongfully accused, Carter was well out the game when convicted. Unfortunately \\"The Hurricane\\" is more about artistic rape.
B00006RGCS|5.0|Roman Holiday is a fun romantic comedy. Audrey Hepburn sparkles in her first starring role; she won an Academy Award for her portrayal of Princess Ann. Gregory Peck is magnificent - always a gentleman. Roman Holiday is one of my very favourites. <br />The Storyline: A sheltered princess, on an official visit to Italy, rebels against her royal obligations and runs away for a day to explore Rome on her own. She meets Gregory Peck, a broke American newspaperman who, seeking an exclusive story, feigns ignorance as to her real identity. <br />This DVD version has been beautifully restored. As a Collector's Edition, it includes several extra features: &quot;Remembering Roman Holiday&quot; Featurette, &quot;Restoring Roman Holiday&quot; Featurette, &quot;Edith Head - The Paramount Years&quot; Featurette, trailers, and a photo gallery. They have clips of Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck, and Eddie Albert remembering Roman Holiday, among others. Gregory Peck tells a story about an incident during the filming that is delightful.<br />A beautiful edition of a beautiful movie.
B00009V7PJ|4.0|First the kudos.  Cher was not only in Miami for this show, but must have stopped off at The Fountain of Youth on the way.  She looked and sounded great.  Her voice has somehow gotten even better as she has aged.  The show is extravagant, with Cher singing her hits in the midst of highly costumed dancers, gymnasts, video clips, and a light show.    <br />My minor criticism.  As with many performances on DVD, it was somewhat &quot;overproduced.&quot;  The camera switches scenes too often, uses zoom too often, and does not focus on the star enough.  I'm also very tired of seeing faces in the crowd on DVDs.  When you attend a concert, do you watch the crowd or the stage?<br />Despite my minor criticism, Cher makes the whole thing very entertaining and worthwhile.  If you like concert DVDs, this one is very good and worth buying.  If you are a Cher fan, it is a must.
B00005JMEW|2.0|I am very disapointed in this film. I have enjoyed some of Tarantino's other films like &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn&quot; and &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;. However, this movie was a let down. I understand what he was trying to do with the violence and the blood splurting out or every wond. It seemed he was trying to make a real life movie resemeling Japanese animation. It may do that is some slight ways, but the plot and the writing are terrible. I do not have any desire to see &quot;Kill Bill 2&quot;. I also find it funny that people think that this movie was originally made with the idea of making two movies and that a sequil was required due to the success of the first Kill Bill. The truth is that this series of movies was only suppose to be one complete movie. I am not sure if it was mere greed of the belief that people would not sit through the entire length of both movies combined, but Tarantino decide to cut the movie in half and try and make twice the money.
B000148KK2|5.0|Back to basic: a piano, a guitar, a bass, a set of drums and her voice. Use the ears, undress the frou-frou, over the top arrangement from previous albums. The result is a classy and intimate song interpretations for Krall's longtime fans. There are a couple of ways to love Diana Krall's style, this is my preference. The girl in the other room is still relevant and back into mine.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|all the reviews i have read on amazon have left me extremly confused they are all one of two extremes: they either review the film as awful or excellent. i would definetly put this film in the 2nd catergory.<br />bill murray is excellent as bob and scarlett johansson makes a good charlotte. the camerawork when around tokyo is a bit dodgy (but good considering they used a handcamera). the film does not exactly have a storyline, but this does not stop it from being a good film. bob and charlotte are just two people trying to find out who they are and what they should do with their lifes.<br />the film has some very funny parts, and is very enjoyable.

B00003CXCT|3.0|No, impressed doesn't quite cover it. I'm AMAZED by the number of \\"reviews\\" of this DVD collection. I mean, it's remarkable when you consider the fact that a review usually presupposes having viewed the material in question that so many people have access to a DVD collection that doesn't come out until September 21, 2004. I understand that many people are very vocal about their like or dislike of the Star Wars Special Edition, and both positions are equally valid, but nothing posted here qualifies as a \\"review\\" unless you own or otherwise have access to the product you are reviewing. The DVD set includes bonus features, documentaries, an Episode III preview, and a video game preview that no one could possibly have already viewed, so please, stop \\"reviewing\\" this product.
B0000041TD|4.0|I love Pavarotti's voice and for me Freni is a lovely Mimi, but I think the Serafin recording with Tebaldi and Bergonzi is better.  Personally I find Karajan completely overblown whenever he conducts Italian opera, listen for example to the Butterfly with Pav and Freni which is totally over the top.  Serafin conducts a much more &quot;Italianate&quot; opera (with a clear beat!) without pushing things to exageerration, which is all too easy with Puccini-kitch.  His tempi are too broad and deliberate.  Listen for example to Che gelida manina in Act 1- where Pav is completely out of time before going up for his high C (other people have written about this aria without noticing that Pav is out of time throughout this passage).  But who can blame him when Karajan is slowing and speeding things up?  Mind you the &quot;money shot&quot; - i.e. the top C- is magical and unique in sound.  Tebaldi on the other recording is not as sweet as Freni but more gutsy.  Bergonzi has none of the Pav tone but is much more musical in his singing.  The Berlin Phil are, as usual, awesome.  So, my verdict is 4 stars: great sound, lovely voices, but all a bit stagey and contrived: I guess it is a stylistic point about the Italian school of conducting and playing versus the German approach, but what happened to the Karajan of the 50s with that fantastic Lucia??.  <br />(PS If you want to hear real characterisation of Mimi try the Callas. The voice is ugly comparared to Tebaldi or Freni but the singing is much superior.)
B000002UA9|4.0|not quite as good as i thought it would be, but i figured it was something i needed. if nothing else, it's fun. just nowhere near the quality of, say, rubber soul. <br />&quot;do you want to know a secret&quot; is still one of my all-time favorite oldies, and i do believe that this version of &quot;twist and shout&quot; is not only the definitive version, but also one of the beatles' most successful vocal performances.
0440539811|5.0|This book is scientifically engineered to rewire your brain.  It is a fictional walkthrough of Leary's Eight Circuits of consciousness and a living testament to the statement, &quot;If you see the Buddha on the road.  Kill him.&quot;<BR>If you don't enjoy having someone challenge you mentally, go back to Grisham, and Clancey, this is not the book for you.
B00000HZFH|4.0|what i said when i bought it: &quot;keep it like a secret just didn't grab me; some of the songs were really great (and even the worst among them was better than the best on the new album, ancient melodies...), but the whole package felt too sterile, too i-wanna-write-songs-people-can-call-'gems'. i just don't like it all that much.&quot; <br />i still feel that way, more or less. i listen to it occasionally, which is more than i can say for anything that followed later. everything since there's nothing wrong with love, i've liked a little less than the one before it.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|I did not enjoy this album one bit.  It is very boring.  She is vey repetive.
B00000I07Q|5.0|seriously, people. i really do believe this album has merit. perhaps the greatest hair metal album released. the ballads are all pitch-perfect, the rockers are catchy, the album feels like an album and not a few hits with filler...they did a great job with this one. <br />trivia: the first album i ever owned, period. (and no, that doesn't make me biased...ahahaha).
B000002B5L|5.0|&quot;The Score&quot; is one of those unique albums that can never be outdone.  Wyclef Jean, Pras, and Lauryn Hill all work together in giving us this classic sophmore album.  Guest appearences by John Forte(a member of the Refugee Family), Tha Outsidaz(Rah Digga, Young Zee, Pacewon), Diamond-D, and Omega all do well, but it's really the main trio that make this album great.  Wyclef's crazy flow, Pras' laidback rhyming, and Lauryn's angellic voice bring a beautiful flava to this LP that no one else could've done.  &quot;How Many Mics&quot; is an example of all three members rhyme skills, especially Pras' who spits, (&quot;too many MC's not enough mics, exit your show like I exit the turnpike&quot;).  &quot;Ready or Not&quot; is one of my all time favorite songs, because of the cool beat and the memorable last lines of Wyclef Jean(&quot;I think not I'll send a letter to my friends, a born again hooligan only to be king again&quot;) and Lauryn's opening line(&quot;I play my enemies like a game of chess&quot;) and lastly Pras' opening(&quot;ready or not refugees taking over&quot;).  &quot;Zealots&quot; is a well made song in which Wyclef sings the hook and Lauryn teaches Hip-Hop physics over an amazing beat.  But it is Pras who delivers the best lyrical verse(&quot;I compress sound sets with my rap DBX, then drop vocals on my 456MPEX, bring terror to the shop of horror, as you cry meamore, the phantom dies in the opera&quot;).  &quot;The Beast&quot; is a weirder song and not one of my favorites, though it is not to be skipped.  &quot;Fu-Gee-La&quot; is another favorite of mine because of its Caribbean lyrics and beat, and amazing chrorus by Lauryn.  &quot;Family Business&quot; is a sad song but another great one with guest rappers Omega and John Forte, rhyming over a frantic beat with a verse surprisingly by Pras(it's the only chorus he does on the whole album).  &quot;Killing Me Softly&quot; is a solo song by Lauryn Hill who remakes the song with a Hip-Hop groove.  &quot;The Score&quot; is quite simply a lyrical song, produced and guest featuring Diamond-D, the trio drop some of their best rhymes in between a scratched hook.  &quot;The Mask&quot; is another good song, with a great chorus and verses.  &quot;Cowboys&quot; is the gangsta western song featuring Tha Outsidaz.  The mix of Carribean rhymes and hardcore rap is amazing and turns out good, even with the oh-lae-he chorus by Wyclef.  &quot;No Woman, No Cry&quot; is another remake, this time of Bob Marley's classic song(Wyclef solo).  &quot;Outro(Manifest)&quot; isn't an outro but another real lyrical song where you can actually hear the anger in the trio's voices.  The first and best remix of &quot;Fu-Gee-La&quot; is the last great song on the album.  The final remix of the song isn't very memorable and not one of my favorites.  The final song &quot;Mista, Mista&quot; is very confusing.  It's a sad song but you can't help laughing at the constant cussing through the whole song.  <br />The main point is that &quot;The Score&quot; is one of the many classic rap albums of the 90's and was very groundbreaking, because it brought Hip-Hop to the entire world.  If you like this album go pick up the trio's solo albums:<br />*Wyclef Jean- &quot;The Carnival&quot;<BR>*Lauryn Hill- &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot;<BR>*Pras- &quot;Ghetto Supastar&quot;<BR>*Wyclef Jean- &quot;Ecleftic: 2 Sides 2 A Book&quot;<BR>*Wyclef Jean- &quot;Masquerade&quot;<BR>*Wyclef Jean- &quot;The Preacher's Son&quot;<br />The Fugees are broken up now, but they will always be remembered as one of the greatest and most creative rap group of all time.                <br />Was this review helpful to you?
B0001MDP3G|4.0|This movie is very appealing to the eye and the heart.  The acting is VERY good, I'd say exceptional.  I'm fairly easy to please with large-scale, epic-style films, especially romantic ones.  When watching this movie, I had the constant feeling that I was &quot;missing&quot; something, as if I had accidentally skipped the beginning and started in the middle.  I didn't get the satisfaction of have a true grip on the history of these characters, and I wanted to see more development of their relationships and to watch it unfold in more detail.  Some say that is the beauty of the film, and I accept that, so I gave it 4 stars.  Interesting and haunting film.
B000006TRV|5.0|With songs like &quot;In the flesh?&quot;, &quot;Run Like Hell,&quot; and &quot;Another Brick In The Wall pt.2,&quot; The Wall just might be Floyd's darkest, hardest album. The lyrics certainly reflect that, telling the story of a disturbed young man whose life becomes so chaotic that he creates a sort of mental barrier between himself and the world, only to have it torn down, &quot;exposing him in front of his peers,&quot; as the second to last song suggests. Throughout his life, our flawed protagonest deals with the death of his father, vicious teachers, an overbearing mother, the pain of growing up in a harsh world full of war and pain. He has a chaotic marriage (&quot;Day after day, love turns gray...&quot;). He becomes a drug-addicted rock star, and loses all of his privacy to the media and to fans. In the end all of demons come back to confront him in the absolutely stunning climatic song &quot;The Trial.&quot; The story is dark, engrossing, and symbolic of our lives, and the trouble we go to in order to seperate ourselves from others. Wall could have made an excellent novel, if you ask me.<br />But above and beyond the story is the music in which it is contained. While Dark Side Of The Moon featured longer, slower songs which unfolded slowly and bled into one another, the songs on Wall are shorter and louder, more hard rock than progressive. &quot;Young Lust,&quot; for example, is a fast paced flat out rocker reminescent of Physical Grafitti era Led Zeppelin. It's driven by a tough as nails guitar riff, a pounding bass line, and an instantly memorable chorus (&quot;oooooooooooh.... I need a dirty woman!&quot;)<BR>The album's oppener, &quot;In The Flesh?,&quot; is a darkly cynical number that is a bit slower than most of The Wall's songs. It makes up for this with some of David Gilmour's most intense guitar work, as well as some of Waters' snarliest, most bitter and sarcastic lyrics (&quot;Tell me is something eluding you, Sunshine/ Is this not what you expected to see?/ If you want to find out what's behind these cold eyes/ You'll just have to crawl your way through this disguise&quot;).<BR>The album does have its softer moments, though. &quot;Mother&quot; is a tuneful accoustic ballad whose lyrics go from refreshingly sweet to darkly disturbing (&quot;Hush my baby, baby don't you cry/ Mamma's gonna make all your nightmares come true/ Mamma will put all her fears into you&quot;). <BR>&quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; is a rich and textured song about drug addiction. It's extremely engrossing, and easy to get lost in. Its lush accoustic guitar chords make it sound like a DSOTM cut.<BR>&quot;Hey You&quot; is a seemingly tender cry for help, which contains my favorite lyric on the album: &quot;But it was only fantasy. The wall was too high, as you can see. No matter how he tried he could not break free.... And the worms ate into his brain.&quot;<BR>&quot;Run Like Hell&quot; is the darkest, hardest, and most cynical track on the album. It's music sounds like something from a queen album (Which is a good thing), and the lyrics talk about a guy who just can't get any privacy.<BR>And how could I leave out the Wall's most famous feature, the infamous &quot;Happiest Days Of Our Lives/ Another Brick In The Wall pt. 2&quot; medely? The ultamite song of adolescent rebellion, with the immortal line &quot;Hey! Teachers! Leave them kids alone!&quot; That's one of the harder songs on the album, and one of my early favorites. But, as any Floyd fan will tell you, its not the best thing the Wall has to offer.<br />More than any other Pink Floyd record, the Wall is epic. Its a perfect balance of thought provoking lyrics and great music. Its what makes Floyd great.
B0002234LS|3.0|I didn't know this film existed until I stumbled upon it when in a rental store.  I found it to be a weak cross between The Shining and Misery, but it kept me interested until the end.  Johnny Depp's acting was very good, but the plot &quot;twists&quot; were not as thrilling as advertised.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I absolutly adore this cd. It is definetly one of my favorites. I love Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor their voices are both amazing and they sounds so good together! Definetly see the movie too because its a hilarous, sad, happy, and scary all at the same time! I really hope you get this cd because it really has fun music!
0571081789|5.0|Don't be put off by the book's reputation as the story of a depressed not-quite-a-woman-not-a-girl protagonist--and certainly don't be put off by the fact that Sylvia Plath died very soon after writing the book. Although she is known primarily for her poetry, I've often thought that Bell Jar captured both her skill as a sharp poetess, but also her lesser-known sense of humor. The Bell Jar involves suicide attempts and mental institutions, but more importantly, it doesn't dwell on tragedy so much as cut through it. Plath's photographic depiction of what it is like to be thrust into adulthood and all the other things that aren't in childhood are equally important and remind the reader that the things that we experience are neither so beautiful nor ugly as they are absurd.<br />Whether or not you've ever been depressed, the Bell Jar captures not only the fear of nothing ever changing, but also the greater fear of things being different, twin processes which are, to me, at the heart of depression.
B00013F38K|5.0|I'm so glad this is out!  Watching this is like a visit with an old  friend - it brings back many memories, and is just a joy to sit down and watch.  I'd forgetten the production value that was put into this series.  For its time, there was nothing like this show, and there still isn't!<br />Little lessons in philosophy nicely incorporated into each story!  A treasure to be sure!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This movie was so entertaining and well created. The characters were very well played out. I don't think there are any other actors that could play the roles as good as Bill and Scarlett-it seemed they just naturally fitted into their roles. I love how their relationship in this movie was gradually getting stronger and stronger, it really kept structure to this film which I adored. And I just loved it. The soundtrack is unbelievable including the amazing Kevin Shields, Squarepusher, and many others. The scenery was just so beautiful to watch. Everything about this film felt so original and true. The visuals and sounds seemed youthful and free, yet both were having problems in their &quot;other&quot; relationship, and this paradox I found made the story more unique and interesting. The light jokes by Murrey were great, I just knew there would be some if he was cast in the film. Overall, the screenplay was well written. It was a simple film: no explotions, special effects, or gore...but sometimes the simpliest things are the brilliant things. I just loved the whole idea how friendship can happen between anyone, and can come and go so quickly. I just wished I knew what Bill's character whispered at the end. This film is a must see, so go rent it.

B00003CXAT|5.0|As a college student now, I was 9 years old when Jurassic Park hit theaters and it couldn't have come at a better time. Watching it again, Jurassic Park holds up as great entertainment, even if the characters and storylines seem a bit flimsy at times. It's probably more worthy of 4 stars than 5, but hey, this is the movie of MY generation and I'm not going to apologize for its rating. Jurassic Park continually reminds its viewers that Steven Spielberg is the greatest entertainer since Walt Disney. Constantly filling the screen with visual treats, keeping the plot moving at a brisk pace (once the obligatory exposition is filled in), and allowing us to enjoy ourselves without stooping too low, nobody does blockbusters like this man. Since he was to direct Schindler's List that same year, this was more or less his kiss-off to the popcorn genre he helped invent (consisting of classics like Jaws, Raiders, and E.T.--some with more dramatic substance than others, but all damn entertaining). Like I said, I was nine when this movie premiered and I still remember watching in the dark theater as the whole show unfolded--perhaps taking it for granted that movies should be so thrilling and fun, and that every filmmaker was capable of such wonders. Wrong on both accounts, but it did spur me on to shoot my first movie on video camera that summer (admittedly, it was highly derivative). Now I'm a film student...thanks Steve<BR>5/6
B0001Z52RU|4.0|Ok, I'm pretty much a negative movie reviewer.  And this was one movie I was against seeing.  I purchased the DVD and watched it today and I must admit, I loved it.  I can't believe the critics were so harsh on this one.  I listened to radio stations trash this film when it came out.  Cons: The ending kind of stunk...I'm not sure if it was the ending (because you did not want that to happen) or just that it was sort of lame.  But who cares?  The movie is great.  Pros: I was moved to tears at one point.  Ashton was actually good.  I can't believe I said that!  Amy Smart is gorgeous and one to watch.<br />Watch this movie and don't believe all the negative critics.  I promise you, you will NOT be sorry!
B00005JMYG|1.0|Total waste of my 8 bucks to go see this, if wil farrell was going for the stupiest movie, he got it. The olny great think in this movie is the character named Brick and the newscaster fight scene, the rest sucked.  Cheap laughs, nothing really original.
B00006JKOM|2.0|&gt;get over the teen aged [sic] idiot attitude people This album is great musically,with the possible exception of the tittle [sic] track,although some of the lyrics are hit and miss but thats [sic] o k ,their [sic] more hit than miss.<br />It's a bit much for someone who can't spell \\"teen-aged\\", \\"title\\", \\"that's\\", and \\"they're\\" to be gratuitously calling others \\"idiots\\".<br />&gt;If you're still limiting yourselves to the first five tull [sic] albums then I feel sorry for your tiny little minds. <br />Actually, that's seven albums (1. \\"This Was\\", 2. \\"Stand Up\\", 3. \\"Benefit\\", 4. \\"Aqualung\\", 5. \\"Thick as a Brick\\", 6. \\"Living in the Past\\", and 7. \\"A Passion Play\\"), and in the opinion of a mind quite capable of spelling \\"teen-aged\\", \\"title\\", \\"that's\\", and \\"they're\\", seven is quite enough. Seven happens to be the number of albums Steely Dan released (before it reformed two decades later) and the number of years the Beatles recorded. Cream released four albums; Police released five. If Ian Anderson really had thirty albums (or however many) worth of things to say, that would be different. Clearly he does not.
0694003611|5.0|This book was one of our bedtime rituals.  When I was weaning my son from frequent night-time breastfeedings, we would read this book at bedtime every evening.  Sometimes I could hear him \\"reading\\" this book to himself in the dark if he was still have trouble settling down. Often, we read it in unison, and chuckled together.  It's sweet and slow and comforting, and simply taking the time to cuddle and read it has a peaceful effect on both parent and child.
B00005JMX6|5.0|If you missed it in theaters, as apparently many did -- this is well worth the buy.  Surprising, enticing. amazing, all the way through.  Great music placement throughout.
B00000I5Y6|3.0|I must say, there are a number of classic rock hits on here, but none of them excite me very much. I probably wouldn't even own this if it wasn't for &quot;Dust In The Wind&quot;. That song is excellent, and reminds me of some of the better stuff from &quot;Crosby Stills &amp; Nash&quot; and &quot;America&quot;. Otherwise this also has &quot;Carry On Wayward Son&quot;, &quot;Point Of No Return&quot;, &quot;Hold On&quot;, and &quot;Play The Game Tonight&quot;, all of which are good, just not the caliber of &quot;Dust In The Wind&quot;. I think my problem is that some of the more rocking songs remind me of &quot;Styx&quot;, and I can't stand them. Overall it's a decent bunch of tunes, but I guess I just can't be a big fan of &quot;Kansas&quot;, when I'm from Missouri.
B00003CXA2|5.0|The first time I saw this film, I was amazed beyond beleife.  Tom Hanks is outstanding as Forest Gump, and every sapporting actor was perfect for the role.  This movie has so many memorable lines in it, its almost insane.  This movie is almost a modern day Rocky, in which it shows what one man could do with his life, and what we should do with our lives.  Easily deserved every reward it got.
B000001GBJ|4.0|Most may call this new age, but celtic and even classical might apply too. It reminds me alot of Loreena McKennitts &quot;Book Of Secrets&quot;, and also a little of &quot;Enya/Clannad&quot;. Some tracks are instrumentals, and those that are not include the most angelic vocals. &quot;Fionnuala Sherry&quot; also plays violin just as well as she sings. Overall it's a very peaceful release from &quot;Secret Garden&quot;, and a perfect album to end your day with, or maybe even start it.
B000059H99|5.0|One of the best films that will ever be captured on film.  It's the no name man, agaist the champ in this great film.  Sylvester Stallone gives his best performence ever on film.  One of the greatest heros ever in modern cinema.  Rocky Balboa taking on the champ in his one chance shot for victory is something to watch.  Many infamouse scenes such as Rocky running up the stepps, rocky puching the meat carcus, and his famous lines in the film will never go away in this boxing classic.
B000002LEM|4.0|Though I also like the David Lee Roth era, because of my age I'm more of a \\"Van Hagar\\" person. I don't think this is as great as \\"5150\\", but it is the next best thing. Included here are the big hits \\"When It's Love\\" and \\"Finish What Ya Started\\", as well as the minor hits \\"Black And Blue\\" and \\"Feels So Good\\". I also really like the opener \\"Mine All Mine\\", and \\"Cabo Wabo\\". Overall it's a very solid album, and probably my fourth favorite over the course of their entire career, after \\"5150\\", the debut, and \\"1984\\". If you like their late 80's material, also check out \\"Sammy's\\" solo 1987 album \\"I Never Said Goodbye\\".
B000002BQK|5.0|I've heard all the Mariah CDs, with the exception of &quot;Charmbracelet&quot;, and I believe that &quot;Butterfly&quot; is her best one, ever.  On this CD Mariah was in the middle -- not quite that slow-moving adult contempo stuff, but not yet the trashy hip-hop collabos she attempts in later albums.  Mariah retains a sweet mix between ballads and mid-tempo songs on this CD.  &quot;Honey&quot; is one of my all time favorite songs, and &quot;My All&quot; has that sweet, Latin soul feel to it.  &quot;The Roof&quot; was one of the first good hip-hop feel songs she did, and &quot;Breakdown&quot; is wonderful.  On this CD, I can't say there's one song that I mind listening to.  (Some, like &quot;Close My Eyes&quot;, I'd rather not, but if it's playing I don't HAVE to turn it *shrugs*), and &quot;The Beautiful Ones&quot; is an insightful song from real life and yet not whiny.  Like I said -- best Mariah album!
B0001NBMBC|1.0|If this was any other band, this cd would be one of the most amazing cd's musically from a metal band in a long time. but unfortunatly for real Slipknot fans, its not some random metal band. Its Slipknot! this is not what they are supposed to sound like. of all the band not to buy into the masses i would have thought they could be considered true originals. with the release of slipknot and iowa fans were given everything they expected from 9 men jumping around stage in jumpsuits and masks. complete insainity. heavy riffs, not in the least shy drums and a singer who produces screams capable of sending chills down ones spine. so i guess i must congradulate slipknot on their new album. way to buy into to pop culture guys. ill be sure to add you to my favorite pop rock band, right up there with maroon 5.
B0002234LS|5.0|I read the book before i saw the movie &amp; when i saw it i was with my friend, who hadn't read it. &amp; i was sitting there thinking... this would be really confusing if i hadn't read the book. There was a whole major part that happened when Mort Rainey was in college that was left out &amp; it explained a WHOLE lot.<br />If you haven't seen the movie or read the book... then go read the book first. It's a novella in the huge book Four Past Midnight by Stephen King. If you've seen the movie but not read the book then i don't know if it's too late to read it. You will probably have a hard time imagining anybody other than Johnny Depp as Mort Rainey. That was the book that got me hooked on Stephen King though.<br />There was one part in the movie that was better than in the book though... &amp; that was the ending. In the book some random guy comes &amp; saves the day but in the movie it's way better (i won't spoil it for y'all). It is a GREAT ending in the movie!!!<br />Overall it was great but read the book first if you haven't seen the movie (Four Past Midnight by Stephen King)!
0060977493|5.0|There is nothing more to say - this is a gem.
B00005JKCH|4.0|That Sam Raimi was the right director for Spider-man's debut on the big screen is obvious once you've seen this film.  His penchant for cartoon-like moments in his other films (e.g., the Evil Dead series, the Quick and the Dead, and the comic-inspired Darkman) boded well for success.  Likewise, his encycopediac knowledge of the character was not new - he'd been collecting Spiderman comics ever since he was a kid.  With such a director at the helm, and with Spider-man creator Stan Lee looking over his shoulder, it's no wonder that Spider-man the Film looks and feels exactly like we'd imagine based on reading Spider-man the Comic.  When compared to, say, the Batman films, Spidey fans must have breathed a sigh of relief that the filmakers got the character mostly right.<br />Most of our favourite Spidey characters are here - Peter Parker (played to &quot;wallflower&quot; perfection by Toby Maguire), his colleagues Harry and Flash, the fiery readhead Mary Jane Watson, and of course Aunt May and Uncle Ben.  The film covers Spiderman's origin (slightly updating the spider bite from a radioactive spider to a genetically enhanced one).  The absolute highlight of the film is his attempt to make money wrestling, where he takes on a seriously buffed-up Randy &quot;Macho Man&quot; Savage (called &quot;Bonesaw&quot; in the film).  Raimi regular Bruce Campbell appears as the ring announcer, apparently using the Elvis hair and wardrobe acquired from his recent &quot;Bubba Ho-tep&quot; film.<br />We then advance to the main story - the battle with arch-enemy Green Goblin, here played by Willem Dafoe, who does an admirable job personifying the villain even though half the time we can't see his face.  Likewise Maguire's Webslinger personifies the comic character using body language, standard Spidey poses, and a generous helping of CGI to aid his webslinging trips through the concrete jungles of Manhatten.  The CGI is normally not intrusive or obvious - a glaring exception being one scene where Spidey takes on 5 muggers simultaneously, where the animation is jerky and unrealistic.  Mostly, though, it's smooth and doesn't defy the laws of physics too badly....<br />True Spider-man fans will question certain decisions of the filmakers, of course.  Most notable is the absence of Gwen Stacy, who is killed by one incarnation of the Green Goblin in the comics.  Unfortunately, we know Mary Jane will be alright when GG threatens her - the same wouldn't be true if it had been Gwen up there.  Similarly, the romantic quadrangle between Peter, Harry, MJ, and Gwen would have been really fun to see on film, if only to give actress Kirsten Dunst a break from all the testoterone-driven action from an otherwise male cast.  Maybe we'll get to see Gwen (and even Felicia (the Black Cat)? he asks hopefully) in the sequels.  Finally, the patented Spider-man wisecracking banter is somewhat submerged in overly melodramatic fight scenes.  Likewise, MJ's confidence - hopefully Raimi allows himself and his characters to loosen up as the series progresses.<br />The DVD is quite good, with some long-ish documentaries on the making of the film and on bringing Spidey to the big screen.  There are some neat comic-book extras as well (although the navigation through some of the comic-book segments is annoying).  Of course, the film itself looks and sounds fantastic (although I have a low-level sound system, and cannot comment on the high-end output).  The commentary featuring Sam Raimi and others is entertaining and informative.  All-in-all, a solid debut for what promises to be a long-running franchise.
B0000C8AVE|5.0|I am not a Dylan fan. But I've got an SACD player, and whenever I notice a retailer selling off their SACD stock cheaply, I tend to hoover it up.<br />I've always felt a bit guilty about not liking Dylan, given that he has had millions of fans, and was, at least until his motorbike accident in 1966, as big as Elvis and the Beatles. I think the problem is that I was born a decade too late, and music has always been much more important to me than lyrics. It may be heretical to say this but, as a teenager in the 1970s, I found the music of bands like Steely Dan and the Doobie Brothers more catchy than Dylan (great though the 'Desire' LP was).<br />But Dylan doesn't go away, and he's now one of the few popular artists to have much of his output available on SACD. THE FREEWHEELIN' BOB DYLAN was one of the key visual references in the recent Cameron Crowe movie VANILLA SKY.<br />I think you have to have lived through the era to really appreciate the impact of what Dylan was doing. Coming late to the era, it matters little to a new fan that 'Highway 61 Revisited' was the first electric folk rock album. There are now hundreds, if not thousands, of electric folk rock albums to choose from, and if anything, the later ones are likely to smoothe off the rough edges of the first.<br />But now I have a wad of Dylan SACDs and the opportunity to wade through them in chronological sequence. And I keep coming back to THE FREEWHEELIN' BOB DYLAN because it possesses a great purity and enthusiasm. As other reviewers have said, it's just the man, his mouth organ and his guitar (apart from on 'Corrina, Corrina'). SACD captures the simplicity of his performance superbly. NB This is SACD Stereo -- not Surround Sound, nor Dolby 5.1.<br />The music is part folk, part blues. Yes, it's slightly repetitive in that it lacks the diversity and creative input you could get from a wider group setting. But for me, this is solo Dylan at the top of his game, bristling with confidence that an enormous audience would take to the album. To enjoy this CD, you don't need to organise a sit-in, protest march or late-night coffee with a few student friends. It really is OK to listen to this in the car or while exercising or even (heaven forbid!) as background music while working or giving a dinner party. Dylan probably foresaw none of these uses for his music, and I suspect the only protest at such abuse would come from his diehard folk fans -- the same ones who protested about his later transition to electric instruments. Me, I just love it because it's so uncluttered. (And normally I don't like folk music!)dience would take to the album.

B000099T2L|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I love Destiny's Child.  That's what makes Beyonce's CD so great, though -- she defines a whole new style for herself, one that's upbeat and funky, which draws from old styles and melds with the new to make an original sound.  The only detractor from this CD were the singles that were played endlessly until you grew so you hated the song...I loved \\"Baby Boy\\" until I heard it on the radio 98534 times; now I skip it every time I play the CD!  \\"Crazy In Love\\" almost had the same problem; luckily it was cut off with another single before it reached unbearable point.  The rest of the songs exhibit a sexy, grown-up style Beyonce didn't totally show with Destiny's Child.  \\"Naughty Girl\\" and \\"Hip Hop Star\\" make for the funky (almost-)dance beats, while most of the rest of the CD has great ballads.  \\"Be With You\\" is a sexy, inspired song...\\"Speechless\\" is probably the best song on the album, in my opinion, with a long, provocative drawl to Beyonce's voice and great music.  \\"Me, Myself, and I\\" is rather annoying in my opinion, but the second half of the CD drew me the most, especially Beyonce's duet with Luther Vandross and \\"Gift from Virgo\\", a very romantic song with so many different styles intertwined.  Four stars -- one deducted from the singles' played-out-ness, but that's not really her fault ^_^
B00004TWZK|5.0|Personally, Stand By Me is in my top 10 movies and stories.  When I compare movies that were written based off of novels, This movie would be in my best list. The script, very correctly portrays the characters that were written in Stephen Kings novella.  The cast couldn't be more perfect for the characters they were supposed to play.  Will Wheaton for Gordie, acted the sensitive kid to a tee.  The movie made me reminice for a childhood I will never know in my generation, and be glad for the opportunity these children (I know they're fictional) had to discover who they were, and where they wanted to go in life. <BR>Seriously a great!!!!! movie.   (Even tho I like the novella better)

B00003CXCT|1.0|It turns out that Lucas was never as talented as anyone thought he was.  The only reason why the original Star Wars films turned out to be a fun trilogy is because he was prevented by either budget or special effects limitations of the time period.  Otherwise, the films would have turned out to be the overblown messes his latest trilogy is turning out to be.  The evidence?  The so-called special editions of his original trilogy.  <br />The worst offenses of these retooled films arises when Lucas creates new scenes which largely consist of Jar Jar Binks level comic relief.  The second worse offenses consist of unnecessary CGI characters added to pre-existing scenes which are glaringly obvious and look completely out of place.  The least of Lucas' offenses consist of touch-ups on old special effects which, in a few cases, are actual improvements.  But even then, Lucas manages to screw up, especially at the end of A New Hope when the original exciting scene of the Death Star blowing up is replaced by an extremely lame burst of light.<br />ILM has fallen too much in love with having actors perform in front of blue screens with obviously computer-generated characters.  At least in the \\"new\\" scene of Han Solo conversing with Jabba the Hutt Harrison Ford actually got to perform on a real set, but Jabba himself looks extremely pathetic in comparison to the animatronics version seen in Return of the Jedi and, furthermore, is much smaller in size.  This scene did not make the first release of A New Hope because they did not have the technology to create Jabba, but in retrospect this was a blessing.  Jabba comes off as a joke when seen walking beside Han and demanding his money.<br />For those who have only seen the retooled ET on DVD, Spielberg's changes (e.g. replacing the government agents' guns with walkie-talkies, and cleaning up the kids' dialogue) are far less ridiculous or a kick in the fans' teeth in comparison to the changes Lucas made.  Lucas and Spielberg really need to leave their old movies alone.  I dread to think what would happen to THX-1138 (a happy ending complete with a Busby Berkley muscial number and guest appearances by a computer generated Elmo perhaps?).
B0001ZX0PG|4.0|Movie making becomes tougher and tougher when everyone is just looking for some flash.  A good drama comes rarely, and when it does , it always moves me.  I found the characters in this film to be very real, and original.  Sean Penn and Tim Robbins did deserve their Oscars. Especially Sean.  I dont even have children, and I felt his pain when his daughter died.  The loss, the desperate desire to do something.  And at the end, his desire overcame his judgement.  <br />My onl complaints were certain scenes:<br />Why involve Kevin bacon's wife in the movie if it doesnt tie into the story?  If you plan on doing something like this, make it relevant to the main story somehow(the case).  Have him feel a connection to Sean's Character because he feels that he will never see his daughter, or something like that.<br />2.  What the hell was up with the ending?  Sean tells Kevin that he just killed their childhood friend, and he picks up the phone to talk to his wife who hasnt said a word to him in months....????.....and Sean's wife in the movie seduces him after he tells her what happened to dave(Tim Robbins)....???...what was the deal with the fake gun from Kevin at the very end?<br />Somehow, through all of that confusion, I liked that movie.  Confusing endings get the actors an award, look at Monster's Ball.
1592400876|3.0|It is quite surprising that a book about grammar would become a runaway bestseller in America today, particularly as there are fewer people reading than ever before, but Lynn Truss's Eats, Shoots & Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation has defied all expectations for the genre.<br />The author is a successful British journalist who decided to pen a book about punctuation as it happens to be one of her greatest passions.  She dedicated it to \\"sticklers\\" everywhere and urged them to unite as the only thing they had to lose was their \\"sense of proportion.\\"  Truss is a perfectionist who dreams of stickler brigades running through the streets and whiting-out misused apostrophes or adding missing question marks to sentences upon advertisements.<br />There is much that is right about this book.  Entire chapters are devoted to individual forms of punctuation.  Over 130 pages of the text concern apostrophes, commas, colons, semicolons, dashes, question marks, and exclamation marks.  Her work is strong when she is discussing the specifics of grammatical usage.  Considerable historical background on language is shared and most of it is quite fascinating.  We learn of a controversy created by a deathbed bound Graham Greene adding a comma to a document, and also the situation of Sir Roger Casement whose legal defense hinged on a bizarre grammatical interpretation of the Treason Act of 1351.  In the end, Casement was \\"hanged on a comma.\\"<br />Eats, Shoots & Leaves can be very educational for those who have difficulty remembering the essentials of grammar.  Many will welcome instruction regarding terms like stet, interrobang, and the \\"yob's comma.\\"<br />Unfortunately, this reviewer cannot recommend the book as its parts are infinitely greater than its whole.  Truss's illuminations are handicapped by her narrative voice.  At first, her cheeky and hyper-adrenaline style charm the reader, but by page 50 one longs for a voice that is content to merely inform as opposed to one that seeks to entertain.  The  incessant asides are tiresome and a source of distraction.  Here is an excellent example:<br />\\"Look at that sentence fly.  Amazing.  The way it stays up like that.  Would anyone mind if I ate the last sandwich?\\"<br />In the sentence below the narrator manages not only to disrupt but to disturb as well:<br />\\"That man was Aldus Manutius the Elder (1450-1515) and I will happily admit I hadn't heard of him until about a year ago, but am now absolutely kicking myself that I never volunteered to have his babies.\\"<br />There is also an irritability about Ms. Truss that cannot be denied.  In the following passage, she shares her views regarding someone with whom she once had a transatlantic correspondence,<br />\\"In hindsight I see it was unrealistic to expect a pen-pal from the 8th grade in Detroit to write like Samuel Johnson.  But on the other hand, what earthly use to me was this vapid mousey moron parading a pigmentational handicap?\\"<br />Then there is the matter of Truss's relentless personalization of punctuation marks which will strike anyone as being odd.  She loves them and we never hear the end of it.  It makes one wonder if the author is attempting to over-compensate for a disdain of humanity by swooning lustily for apostrophes and semi-colons.  This excessive enthusiasm for punctuation affects the palate like four packets of saccharin in a small cup of coffee.<br />Yet another defect is that there has been no Americanization of the book.  Her rules and procedures often are inappropriate for those who live outside of Britain.  A three page discussion of how and where to use quotation marks disappointingly ends with, \\"[u]nless, of course, you are in America.\\"  Given the amount of sales in England, there is little excuse as to why the publisher didn't alter selected passages to meet the needs of those of us in the colonies.<br />This reviewer certainly cannot deny that Eats, Shoots & Leaves has some value for neophytes, but there are numerous works on the mechanics of writing, such as L. Sue Baugh's Essentials of English Grammar, that are more informative and less expensive.us works on the mechanics of writing, such as L.

B0000DD7LC|4.0|I am so, so tired of the pop culture -- so many times the ones who get credit for \\"great\\" songs write songs with materialistic, sexually-overblown and violent drug-influenced themes.  That's why I was so happy that Alicia Keys released a second album -- it was like a saving grace from the destroyed pop culture.  Her single \\"You Don't Know My Name\\" was what convinced me to buy the album; the total theme of the song is so sweet and the background music is BEAUTIFUL.  When I heard the CD, I listed to practically the whole thing without skipping.  I prayed and prayed that \\"If I Ain't Got You\\" wouldn't be released as her second single (I hate when really good songs are made into singles, because they are hot and get SO played out), but I knew it would be because the song is so beautiful and talks about deep, meaningful themes.  Not only does Keys appreciate the edgy, funky style of the '60s and '70s -- and generously incorporates it into her music; the style is very apparent on this album -- but she also knows that she doesn't have to buy into this sex-crazed world to make real music.  None of Keys' songs come off as sleazy or contrived.  Although the songs really don't seem to document her life much, I think \\"The Diary...\\" is an appropriate title because it exhibits her personal style, giving you more insight into the *kind* of person she is.  Best hits -- \\"Heartburn\\" (don't let the Timbaland fool you, this song is a funk throwback), \\"You Don't Know My Name\\" (even the talking interlude in the middle is sultry and drawing), \\"If I Ain't Got You\\" (beautiful), \\"Dragon Days\\" (wonderful, funky tune, and an odd likeness), \\"Wake Up\\" (very sixties!), \\"So Simple\\"
B00005OM4Q|5.0|I got this director's cut edition because I so was so intrigued by the original theatrical release.  I wanted more.<br />What I didn't expect was how very the new material (typically extended scenes though there are a few new scenes as well) changed the tone and feel of this film. Penny Lane comes across as a tragic, lost soul. Stillwater comes across as a bunch of debauched, spoiled, poorly educated, brain challenged musicians. The &quot;suits&quot; - including the Rolling Stone &quot;hippy suits&quot; - come across as sharks. William Miller comes across as a well intentioned but naive quick learner. He seems vulnerable.  Alot of the ackward mysteries of the theatrical release (How did Lester Bangs and William end up at a pizza joint after they had just said good-bye?  Why did Russell deny everything after encouraging William to write what he wanted to?  What held Stillwater together after those shocking confessions on the plane? There are many other examples.)<br />It almost like a different film!  In fact, a BETTER film I would have to say.<br />Further, based on my experience in the music industry I found this director's cut to be more reality than fantasy -- the inverse was true of the theatrical release from my perspective. It's STILL not at a &quot;documentary&quot; level but, hey, this isn't suppose to be a horror flick is it?<br />Also, I know it's kind of whacky (maybe I'm a brain challenged musician too) but I really dig Stillwater's music.  I have been listening to the Stillwater CD that comes in the package since I got it.  I agree with Cameron Crowe, if these guys toured I would go see them!  The movie is great but this CD (filled with songs by Nancy Wilson of Heart and Peter Frampton) really cooks.<br />Overall I just couldn't be happier with my Almost Famous Director's Edition set.
B000002J09|5.0|i dont have to repeat what every other reviewer has said about this masterpiece which was one of the most succesful heavy metal classics of all time due to the presence of songs like blck dog,rock n roll,stairway to heaven and when the leevee breaks.this album should be there in your collection so go and get it.very highly recommended.
B0000CD5FN|5.0|When I think of post-humously issued albums I inevitably think of Nirvana's Unplugged in New York.  That album reminds me of a funeral procession, and I can't help but think back on how great Kurt Cobain was as a person and as a musician.  What surprises me about Joe Strummer's last album is that it's the complete opposite of Nirvana's.  This album is a celebration of life, and while I can't help but feel sad about Joe Strummer's passing this sadness is my own and not his.  Listening to it is like witnessing the prodigal son returning home.  For his last few albums Joe Strummer had delved into world beat, eschewing his rock roots, and while I feel those albums were successful, I also believe that his return is even more triumphant.  Streetcore is a return to rock in many ways, but Joe doesn't ignore the vast amount of influences such as reggae, dub, blues, and folk.  If anything these influences are just integrated better.  Every song is strong on this album, and even the acoustic numbers pulse with life.  Perhaps a little older, a little wiser, and a little more laid back, but Joe never gave up living beyond the status quo.  This album didn't make me want to go back and relive London Calling for the one-thousandth time, instead it made me want to hit play again.  Now when I think of post-humously issued albums, Joe Strummer's finale has a place right next to Kurt Cobain's.
0399143904|5.0|In RAINBOW SIX, we see the return of John Clark as the lead character in a typical heavy, meaningful plot that Clancy has done on a level above any other author for many years. The theme of the book, and the video games that have followed, is a multinational counter-terrorism unit called Rainbow, with John Clark running the show. One reviewer stated that this is the typical &quot;Americans are the best...&quot; plot, but it's really not. Rainbow is formed by members of several countries, including the United States, England, Germany, and Israel. It's not just a United States dominated unit.<br />From the opening pages on, Clancy paints a brilliant picture of life on Earth in a post-9/11 world...and then you realize that this book was written and published in 1998! The ability that Clancy has shown to be ahead of his time in his plots is just another example of his brilliance. This is reflected again in an earlier Clancy novel, DEBT OF HONOR, from 1996, where in the climax we read through a scene frighteningly similar to the events of 9/11/01. RAINBOW SIX, while thick at 740 pages, is really a fast read. Clancy interweaves multiple storylines and more than a handful of characters into an overall story that truly has you thinking about the world around you by the time you finish. With action sequence after action sequence, the book rarely hits a lull and keeps you enthralled to the point that you're disappointed to set it down. One nice part of it all is that the book shows that there are left-wing extremist crazy people out there too...all the insane ones aren't right-wingers as most in the media will lead you to believe.<br />Great books make you think. With that in mind, RAINBOW SIX is a great book by one of the greatest authors of our time. Now...let's get that movie into production.
B00004R99J|1.0|As always, Disney provides us with an hour-glass shaped, beautifully dashing, ever accomodating heroine, and a strong, handsome, brave, conquering hero; a romance story that is historically inaccurate, romanticized, racist, and sexist.  \\"Pocahontas\\" was not her real name, and she was about ten years old. According to LEGEND, she saved John Smith's life - the woman of color saves the white man, while falling in love with him. According to REAL history, he was brought in to the village, well-fed and well-treated. Most likely, she simply talked with him while he was in her village. There was NO romantic relationship. She was actually kidnapped a few years later and held for ransom in Jamestown. She died of a White Man's disease. Disney has created a cartoon \\"Romeo & Juliet\\" story for children, and what hurts my heart the most is that people really believe that the Disney version is true.  There are so many un-truths in the world, especially in our Media, and \\"Pocahontas\\" is one of them.

If you don't like it then it might be benificial for you to pick up a joint, smoke it,sit down and relax and then put the CD in the CD player. Pink Floyd is one of the all time classics and it's a shame that they aren't together anymore even though Roger Waters is still doing some great stuff.  If you don't like them then you are in the vast minority.  At least we still have one of the next best things today, Radiohead.

B000084T18|3.0|...Now let's get one thing straight. I don't like HIP POP (That goes for any so called HIP HOP song that is over played on MTV) but there is nothing wrong with listening to it. Now in all my reviews I just try and concentrate on the album by itself alone... and not judge the album on the merit of the artist.<br />Now let's get one thing straight. When you sign with AFtermath/Shady records you're gonna get top notch production. Well that's what you get. The problem is though I feel like 50cent sacrificed his lyrics for good beats. <br />I know 50cent is a moron but before he signed to Shady Records he was really really good. I mean 1000times better than he is now. I just don't understand. Seriously go and buy Power Of The Dollar and you'll see what I mean. He was seriously talented before he joined Shady Aftermath.<br />I don't know what went wrong... if it's because of him being shot in the jaw that affected his speech it is understandable because he flows much better on his past albums... but that's doesn't make and excuse for poor lyrics. 50 Cent already had the image that would appeal to naive kids, so if he wrote lyrics like he did before I'm sure it would've still appealed to them... but he really has dumbed down.<br />Really... someone's already quoted what I gonna quote &quot;Love you like a fat kid loves cake&quot;  Plluurrse.... any 1st grader could've come up with that. I mean really if that's meant to turn on women he must be attracting some fat ugly hos.<br />Bottom Line: This album has it's moments....to be honest all the singles he has released are his best as well as a few cuts on the album. But the fact is 12 out of this 17+ track album is good. <br />The reason I deduct 2 stars os because of his poor lyrics and flow. I think &quot;If I Can't&quot; is probably his best track but hey that's just me.<br />Now moving away from the album I just wanna let you know I hate 50cent and his Gorilla Unit Crew (are they called that because of their ugly mugs?) who knows... but what I do know is that 50cent had his shine in 2003 and now finally the fire is burning out. He has contributed to the joke hip hop has become today. Really, you wouldn't believe how many white suburban kids that go to my school listen to him. I'm not racist but when you attract kids who are not even ghetto or think killing people is cool you know you must've gone wrong somewhere. BUt hey why should he care. At the end of the die just look at the title of this album. Get Rich Or Die Tryin... and you gotta give him props... he knows at the end of the die f**k the fans... it's all about the dollar. And at least he's honest about it.<br />So should you buy it? Well if you want to contribute you the downfall of hip hop yes. This album does have it's guilty pleasure (no matter how much you love underground music) but still I would burn this and not add another $10+ to this guys fat wallet. I feel it's the production that saves this album.<br />Peeaacceee
B0000CAQ27|4.0|It's too bad this album hasn't sold as well as her other 2 albums. Some people may get the impression the CD isn't very good just because it wasn't a big hit. Well, don't get the wrong impression. This is a very good CD that is a departure from her other CDs, but that's what I love about Pink. She is unpredictable and she has a great voice, which she proves once again on this album. <br />Some people were turned off by the lyrics on this album. While they are pretty filthy, Pink never pretended to be the kind of artist who is afraid of ticking people off with obscenity. <br />Although Linda Perry only produced 3 songs on this album. Tim Armstrong is a good match for Pink. He really knows how to let her music speak for itself. Pink took a chance by working with him, and it pays off. <br />The best songs on here are &quot;Trouble&quot;, &quot;Oh My God&quot;, &quot;Catch Me While I'm Sleeping&quot;, &quot;Waiting For Love&quot;, &quot;Try Too Hard&quot;, and &quot;Hooker&quot; (which is a bonus track so don't stop the CD right after the last listed track).<br />I highly recommend this CD. Here Pink continues to show she is a one-of-a-kind artist and that no one does it like she her. Check it out.
B000002MIY|3.0|There are three songs here that are sort of catchy: &quot;Snowbound&quot;, Florida Room&quot;, and &quot;On the Dunes&quot;. Unfortunately, Florida's appeal is meretricious and Snow's arrangement (the synthesizer bit) kills it (its lyric wasn't much anyway). Dunes is somewhat marred by Fagin's attempting to sing soulfully on the last refrain (his highly limited vocal equipment sounds grotesquely tortured instead) and by the interminable instrumental coda (or, as Walter Becker would put it in defiance of logical, grammatical, and semantic sense, &quot;outtro&quot;). &quot;Tomorrow's Girls&quot; is not tuneful or particularly catchy, but it an amusing and well-made track, with a tag seemingly influenced by David Byrne of Talking Heads (pretty much the vocal equivalent of Fagin, actually). The rest of the album isn't worth bothering with, monotonous tuneless quasi-funk (though it's interesting that one song musically foreshadows &quot;What a Shame About Me&quot; from &quot;Two Against Nature&quot;).<br />Considering that Walter Becker produced this, played bass and guitar on this, and co-wrote one song (I forget which, but I think it may have been &quot;Snowbound&quot;), you might almost consider this a Steely Dan record without the quality control. It may be possible to make an album approaching the Steely Dan standard by selecting tracks from Fagin's two solo albums and Becker's one solo album. If so, the tracks from this to select are &quot;Tomorrow's Girls&quot; and &quot;On the Dunes&quot; (just remember to fade-out the coda early).
0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is my favorite Austen book. I was even slightly dissapointed when I read Sense and Sensibility because it didn't come close to Pride and Prejudice. The well developed characters and plot and emotions of P&amp;P (as Austen refered to it)soar above her other novels. Although I did enjoy Emma and Northanger Abby quite well.<br /> However, I have read the Jane Austen Book Club, a new book, and I would just like to NOT recommened that book.
B00003CXCT|4.0|The great thing about DVD is the quality of the sound and picture. Though many say its just putting a VHS on a disc, they are completely wrong! DVD digitizes the media so that it is crystal clear and the quality of sound is improved dramatically. When playing the VHS versions of the Star Wars Trilogy you find the surround sound... well lacking. <BR>  Now that the Trilogy is on DVD, you finally get the surround sound you've been looking for. Now I know that it has not been released as of yet, nor have I been able to view it, however I do know that when compared (even with old movies) to DVD, VHS doesn't come close. Imagine a tie fighter screaming over the Millenium Falcon as  the sound comes from behind and speeds towards the front speakers of your surround sound! <BR> I reccomend these DVD's for people with surround sound and/or want the behind the scenes scoop of the Star Wars Trilogy. However for the overall price of people just wanting the extras, its not worth your money if you don't have surround sound. My advice to people is that you should stay away from action DVD's if you don;t have surround sound; you'll miss the bang that the creator wanted the movie to give you. The only other negitive thing I would say about this DVD is that people without surround sound will be missing a lot of what DVD really is; quality sound entertainment.
B000089RVX|5.0|To those of you who say they are over rated kiss my a**. You obviously don't know real music when you hear it. Amy Lee's vocal's and Evanescence's lyrics are the most moving and inspirational words I have heard from a rock or any other kind of band in a very long time.

At first I wasn't sure I liked it as much as Let Go, but having listened to it several times since then, I like it even more than her first album.

One of the best songs here. <BR>2)Together: I love how Avril sounds at the beginning of this song. She really shows off her range here.<BR>3)Don't Tell Me: great choice as the first single. I love the song's message and I love the chorus. <BR>4)He Wasn't: the &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; of this album. Very catchy.<BR>5)How Does It Feel: a terrific song in the vein of &quot;I'm With You&quot;. Avril sounds terrific here.<BR>6)My Happy Ending: my favorite song on the album. An excellent choice as the second single. I just love this song.<BR>7)Nobody's Home: her collaboration with Ben Moody. Very good song.<BR>8)Forgotten: another great song. I love how Avril sounds on this song. One of my favorites.<BR>9)Who Knows: surprisingly upbeat, considering how everone thinks she is always so sour in her music.<BR>10)Fall To Pieces: I really like this song. It's very catchy.<BR>11)Freak Out: a good song. The lyrics are a little cliched (&quot;Walk around with your hands up in the air like you don't care&quot;), but it's still good.<BR>12)Slipped Away: very good song. It's a good tribute to her grandfather, and it proves Avril is more than just &quot;boys boys boys&quot;.<br />Overall this is a very good album. Avril definitely avoids the sophomore slump. What makes the album even better is that she didn't work with The Matrix this time around. Since they were largely responsible for her signature sound, I wondered if she could pull off an album without them. Thankfully, she did. These songs are even better and catchier than the hits off her first album. On her next album, I would love to see Avril go even further in the darker direction she takes on many of the songs here. I think most of the negative reviews here are by people who just hate Avril and haven't even listened to the album. Coming from someone who actually listened to this CD, I highly recommend it.
B000002UDB|5.0|Recently,a poll was taken as to which songs were the greatest ever,with many songs from Tour making the list... sniveling malcontents can cry over that fact,but the truth is the truth,oh,its true!!!
B00003CXCT|1.0|There is no way I'm buying these.  Absolutely not.  I'll get the real versions off ebay or at a comic book convention since you don't have the brains to release them. To all the upset fans who dislike the SE DVDs I say go to the library, or look around here on Amazon, there are a lot of good books that they don't go back and rewrite.<br />All this garbage about \\"original vision\\" is just talk.  So, I guess Lucas didn't have the cash to pay for the special effects for Greedo's first shot so he just had to settle for Han firing first till he'd sold $10 zillion in toys to pay for a remake?  Whatever, the SE are just more marketing by a guy who got lucky and wasn't smart enought to pass the creative reins over to someone qualified for the job.  That's the cue for all the indignant fans to chime in with the \\"HIS vision...HIS story\\" schtick or even a Binksy \\"How wude\\".  Well HIS vision is crap. And if the ewokies, gugunguhs, midichlorians and the romance between 8 year old boy and 15 year old girl hasn't convinced you I can't imagine my review will change your mind.  <br />I have only $7 more for you George and that's for the episode 3 admission.  It will be mighty embarrassing sitting in the theatre with all of the other people who's curiosity insists that they pay the cash for a ticket to that travesty instead of spending it on something more enjoyable like getting 50 baseballs straight to the skull at the local batting cage. Luckily it will be a dark theatre, hell maybe that's why people still go in costume, to hide their identities! Anyway when you drop your last turd your free ride is over. I can put the lid down, flush and wash my hands of it all.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is a very good CD. Britney's music is more grown-up and she's definitely not afraid to show off her sexual side. The best songs on here are \\"Showdown\\", \\"Breathe on Me\\", and \\"Outrageous\\". <br />I think the reason this album gets bad reviews is because most of the people writing them haven't really listened to the album. They simply can't stand Britney Spears and decide to write all these negative reviews without even listening to the album. Well, if they have that much time on their hands, that's their problem. I would be surprised if the people who wrote them could describe the songs that haven't been played on MTV yet. <br />Give this CD a chance. Britney comes into her own and I for one like the new direction her music is taking. Check it out.
B00005JN0A|2.0|I don't get this movie.  But, when I was a teenager Tim Robbins was playing \\"Mother\\" in B-comedies, so maybe this would have entertained me when I was 15.  <br />Clearly Freddie Prinze Jr. wasn't available so they get a look-alike.  An enjoyable part of this is the Matthew Lillard replacements.  Overall, the premise is good - friends go to Europe, High Jinks ensue.  Too bad along the way we're asked to ignore some super childish plot points that take you out of the movie.  There's nothing amusing about a brother and sister making out, old men at a nude beach is just repulsive, and anyone who has been to Europe is going to see the writers were hoping their audience lived in a bubble and in addition to having never traveled, having never read anything about the Vatican, don't know the value of the American dollar,  and find a just-legal teenage girl distractingly attractive.<br />If you hope this comedy will entertain you, you at least won't be disappointed by Matt Damon lip syncing \\"Scotty Doesn't Know.\\"  By far the funniest part of the movie occurs in the first 15 minutes.
B000002IST|2.0|We Cant Dance at 70 minutes is the 2nd longest Genesis album only shorter then The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway (which is 85 minutes) but somehow thats not saying much. Still this manages to be a 2 1/2 star album along with And Then There Were Three putting it slightly over the other 4 albums Genesis made as a Phil Collins led trio. Longer more complex compositions with stronger playing attribute to this. The Last Spike and Fading Lights are classic Prog Rockers while No Son Of Mine and Living Forever are good and I Cant Dance and Jesus He Loves Me are ok. The rest of this album is awfull even at the end of thier stint with Collins Trio Genesis failed to even make a good album.
B0000D14JV|5.0|I was very happy when I got Freaky Friday for christmas and I enjoy every moment of it. It has a little of everything for the whole family. Rock, love and comdey it just a feel good movie for any age.
B000001DYD|5.0|For years I have heard raves about PJ Harvey. I had never heard her music, but I didn't make any attempt to seek it out. Then in Blender they raved about this CD. I went online and heard a snippet of the title track off this album. I immediately fell in love with the song and impulsively ordered the entire album. Having listened to the whole album, I did not make a mistake in ordering it. The sheer intensity of the album does not let up at all. PJ Harvey has a great voice that is able to pull off almost every song on this album. Every song is terrific. The arrangements of the song were deceptively simple too. When I heard the entire song of the title track, it seems very quiet and intense and then 2 minutes in she lets the music rip and she never lets go until the end of the album. The only song I don't care for is \\"Man-Size Sextet\\". It's a weird inclusion, but I don't ever skip over it because I don't want to miss a second of this album (it's just so good).<br />I give this album my highest recommendation. If you like your music raw and intense, then you should definitely check this album out. I listened to it every morning for about a month. Believe me, it really wakes you up and gets you ready for the day!
B00008K7AM|3.0|I do not know what anyone expects when they see this movie.  From the trailers I never expected it to not suck.  I was pleasantly surprised.  <br />It is not worth the $17.99 it is still listed as, but it is worth a rental.  The cast of girls and the interaction with Rob Schneider makes for some amusing scenarios.  <br />The plot is not surprising, but it is not insulting - given the premise.  It doesn't bog down in lessons or morales. I was again surprised.<br />If you are a Rob Schneider fan, you will enjoy it.  If you are not, but have been sucked into seeing Gigilo and Animal, this will offer a little forgiveness.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Let me start by saying that I am not a metalhead or a hardcore punk.  I like almost all kinds of music (except country), especially hard rock.  So when I got the Madden 2004 videogame, I was pleasantly surpised by the one song on its soundtrack that was vastly superior to the other tunes: Waking the Fallen's &quot;Chapter Four.&quot;  I bought the album the week it released, and it is now my 2nd favorite album of all time.  (For the record, Van Halen's first album is 3rd, and Jimi Hendrix's<BR>&quot;Are You Experienced&quot; is 1st.)<br />I don't know how anyone can help finding something to like about this album.  It has anthemic choruses, hardcore breakdowns, truly epic songs, virtuoso vocals (M. Shadows is an amazing cross between Chris Cornell and Axl Rose, except he may actually be a better singer than either in their prime), and slamming, shredder-worthy guitar.  For every abrasively hard &quot;Eternal Rest&quot; and &quot;Desecrate Through Reverance,&quot; there is the fractured melodicism of &quot;Unholy Confessions&quot; and &quot;Second Heartbeat.&quot;  Pts. 1 and 2 of &quot;I Won't See You Tonight&quot; mix straight metal with prog-rock grandeur and make the album worth purchasing by themselves.  Don't be off-put by the goth-metal imagery of the album's booklet and outer sleeve; they simply set you up for the wonderfully flawed beauty of A7X's music.  The song arrangements get you comfortable and then blast off in a whole new direction, much like System of a Down might if they had longer songs.  That's actually something that sets Waking the Fallen apart; instead of verse-chorus-verse, you're never quite sure what an A7X song is going to do next. Sometimes songs feel a bit long-winded, but it doesn't detract from the overall package.<br />If there's one thing every song (except the title track, which is just an intro anyway) does do, they show off the musicianship of the band.  Drummer The Rev. is amazing, and guitarists Synyster Gates and Zacky Venganceare impeccably tight with their riffs.  Gates in particular has a shot at guitar-hero status due to his mind-blowing solos, particularly on &quot;Eternal Rest&quot; and &quot;Second Heartbeat.&quot;  I could go on for pages about M. Shadows, but words fail to describe his mesmerizing vocals any further.  Amazingly, all of them recently turned 20.  It can only get better from here.<br />Overall, if you're looking for something fresh, get this album NOW.  If you get it and decide it's crap, then e-mail me and tell me so.  However, unless you only listen to fluffy pop, you will find something to like about this album.  Prepare to rock really, really hard.
B00020HEG6|5.0|John Williams has proven once more that he is the premier score writer.  While retaining some of the old themes from the the two previous Harry Potter films, Williams weaves a new, and somewhat darker, score as compared to the light scores of &quot;Sorcerer's Stone&quot; and &quot;Chamber of Secrets.&quot;  What really sets this soundtrack apart is Williams medieval tone, set through the children's chorus &quot;Double Trouble.&quot;  Some of the best selections are coupled with the more personal moments in the movie: &quot;Window to the Past&quot; and &quot;Finale&quot; which couple with Harry's conversations with Lupin and Sirius, respectively.    Without a doubt, this soundtrack is the best Harry Potter soundtrack.  Can't wait for the next one!
B000066NW0|5.0|I bought this album 2 years ago solely on the strength of her first single &quot;Complicated&quot;. I didn't know what she looked like. All I knew was that I liked her music. I loved this CD the first time I listened to it. Avril really does have a very good voice, and her songs are surprisingly strong for a debut album. I think the reason a lot of people don't like her is because of the way she is marketed. They think she is immature and coasting on her &quot;image&quot; to sell CDs. I bought this album simply because I liked her music. I could care less about her image or how her label wants her to come across. The truth is the girl makes good music and what more can you ask for? I have listened to this album over and over and it has yet to get old. The best songs are the darker ones. &quot;Losing Grip&quot;, &quot;Unwanted&quot;, and &quot;Too Much to Ask&quot; are great and show her range. Both of her CDs are good, but I recommend getting this one first if only to see how much she got right on her first album. Plus, the songs will be stuck in your head for days, which in this case is a good thing.
B0001L3LUE|4.0|For his award-winning documentary, \\"The Fog of War\\" - a study of the moral complexities of war and those who wage it - Errol Morris has found the perfect subject in Robert S. McNamara, the man who served as Secretary of Defense in the early days of the Vietnam War.  McNamara is astute, articulate, lively and thoughtful, and as a wizened man of 85, he is able to look back on the events of his life with the kind of analytical clarity and sober-minded judgment that only old age can provide.<br />Wisely, Morris allows McNamara to speak for himself, providing very little in the way of poking and prodding as interviewer and filmmaker.  McNamara looks at his long and varied career through the prism of eleven lessons he's learned about life and human nature.  Each of these revelations is tied into a specific chapter of that career and life.  We see McNamara taking stock of his actions as they relate to World War II, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and most notably, of course, the Vietnam War, in each case ruminating aloud about the moral imperatives and ethical decisions he faced on a daily basis as his crucial role in all of these events played itself out.  Some may find his comments to be a bit self-serving, an attempt to whitewash the facts and minimize his own responsibility, particularly as concerns his involvement in the Vietnam War.  Yet, in many instances, McNamara accepts the judgments of history and admits his culpability, even if he generally does so in a broader war-is-a-necessary-evil context.  There are moments during his reminiscence when McNamara actually wells up with tears, thinking about the immense loss of life and personal tragedy that inevitably result from man's insane obsession with destroying his fellow man - while all the time acknowledging that at times wars must be fought and casualties endured for a greater cause.  All throughout the film, McNamara returns to this refrain, additionally warning us that, in the nuclear age in which we live, the human propensity for warfare could very easily lead us over the precipice to global devastation and annihilation as a species.  We have little reason to believe that McNamara is not being sincere in his comments, although some more cynical viewers may wonder if he isn't merely saying what he thinks he should be saying in order to secure a more favorable reputation and image for himself as his life comes to a close.  If that is, indeed, the case, Morris seems blissfully unaware of it, since he basically accepts McNamara's statements at face value.  As an added - and perhaps unintended bonus - much of what McNamara says has a pertinent, timely, almost prescient ring to it, as the U.S. struggles through yet another foreign engagement, this time in Iraq.<br />As a documentary filmmaker, Morris demonstrates his usual skill at combining archival footage with one-on-one interviews as a way of bringing his subject matter to life.  The caveat here is that Morris provides no counter voices to challenge any of McNamara's statements or his interpretation of events.  Yet, as McNamara relates the story of his life, a fascinating history of 20th Century American foreign policy emerges in the background.  We see many of the seminal figures from McNamara's time playing out the roles history and the fates assigned to them, from John Kennedy to Lyndon Johnson to Nikita Khrushchev to a whole host of other key players on the world stage.  In addition, Philip Glass and John Kusiak have provided a haunting score to go along with the haunting images.<br />As the title suggests, this is a complex film on a complex subject and McNamara and Morris leave us with no pat or easy answers.  That is as it should be.opensity for warfare could very easily lead us over the precipice to global devastation and annihilation as a species.

B00024BHTC|1.0|This album is weary.  The songs just sound daft.  To use opera as a basis of rock, shows that Nightwish cannot write anything original.  The singing is terrible, I know that because I have a degree in music.  Overall, save your money.
B000000WA4|4.0|&quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot; by the Smashing Pumpkins was easily the biggest (in every sense of the word) album to hit in the post-grunge alternative rock heyday that was my adolescence.  In fact, I would say that this was the early peak of the movement - a seemingly bloated double album by a band that had a slew of hits off their major label debut just a few years earlier.  Soon enough, everyone had a &quot;Zero&quot; shirt and listened to this album day and night, or at least the half-dozen or so singles that were played on modern rock radio.<br />The best thing I can say about this release is that I have no problem sitting down and listening to the whole thing (that's two hours, kids), even 9 years after its initial release.  And it's solid.  The whole double-disc affair holds up well for those entire two hours.  The reason that it doesn't get the coveted five-star rating is that the bulk of the songs are good, with a few occassional forays into &quot;great.&quot;  Fortunately, there are no duds on this album.  &quot;Muzzle,&quot; &quot;Tales of a Scorched Earth,&quot; &quot;1979,&quot; &quot;X.Y.U.,&quot; and &quot;An Ode to No One&quot; are the cream of the crop, but like I said, the rest of the album deserves repeated listenings.<br />Anyone that grew up around this time and listened to alternative rock either owned this at one point, knew someone that did, or still does own it.  It really is an essential release for its time and place, and it holds up very well into the 21st century.
B0001HAISG|3.0|Peter Pan is true to Barrie's book. It's an ok adaption. The special effects are the best part of the movie. The worst part is Tinker Bell. She made me wish for Julia Roberts from Hook.
B000059Z8J|5.0|More than a quarter of a century since it first played, absolutely NO movie in this genre compares to Superman!<br />This DVD version is just icing on the cake.<br />For exquisitely lush cinematography, to an incomparable score, to special effects that sturdily hold up 26 years later, one of the original slogans of this movie holds true to this day: &quot;You will believe a man can FLY!&quot;<br />You don't have to be a Superman junkie to adore this movie (although I guarantee you'll become one if you watch the restored DVD version.) Richard Donner's loving and respectful take on Superman is absolutely incomparable from the first scenes - showing a child turning the pages of an Action comic (the first venue of Superman), filmed in black and white.<br />Superman's humble beginnings on the pages of a Depression-era comic book, to this amazing movie, is just perfection the way Donner films it. <br />The early days as Superman grows up are a golden tribute to the American heartland (make no mistake about it; Donner's vision of Superman isn't just about a comicbook hero, but where and how that hero fits into the American vision of this country.) <br />I fell in love with Glenn Ford all over again as Pa Kent (and yes, the great, handsome actor is still alive and kicking!) Marlon Brando as Jor-El, Superman's Kryptonian birth father, is worth every penny of the more than $3 million he was paid for two weeks' work (you gotta love the SERIOUSNESS with which Brando portrays Jor-El; it just enhances the Superman mythology.)<br />The original Daily News building in Manhattan plays home to the Daily Planet. Lots of shots of 1978 New York in this flick, including the World Trade Center merrily blinking in the background as Superman takes Lois Lane for a nighttime spin through the Manhattan skyline.<br />Margot Kidder is phenomenal as Lois, transformed here as a go-getter reporter who can't spell for beans but who loves a good tabloid story full of murder and mayhem. Jackie Cooperdoes a great turn as Perry White, urging his reporters to nab an inteview with the Man of Steel as the greatest thing &quot;since God talked to Moses.&quot; <br />Next to Glenn Ford, I have to say that Gene Hackman's portrayal of Lex Luther - the self-described &quot;greatest criminal mind of our time!&quot; - is just amazingly funny. Ned Beatty as the doofy Otis, following around &quot;Mister Lootor,&quot; is a superb second banana. Valerie Perrine does one of her best jobs as Hackman's moll, Miss Tessmocker.<br />Then we come to Chris Reeve. All I can say is that most actors would give their eyeteeth and right arm to be able to have a role like this in their resume. Reeve is simply superb - he was BORN to be Superman. He approaches the role with seriousness and a bit of wry humor. It's safe to say that this is HIS role; no other actor will ever come close to approaching the job he does.<br />I can't watch this movie without being a kid again, seeing it in a theatre with my parents, screaming and applauding and cheering, and being absolutely blown away by the entire way it was done.<br />Add this DVD to your collection. If you're like me, you will want to introduce your own kids to the movie that truly made you believe &quot;a man can fly.&quot;<br />Twenty-six years later, he still does, and not one iota of the film's original magnificence has dimmed.<br />Thank you, everyone involved in the 1978 version of Superman! It's as amazing now as it was when it was releassed!

0688163173|4.0|Mr. Lehane has crafted another pulsating page turner.  He is a writer that seems to understand the human mind rather than a psychologist that is trying to write ( don't get me wrong - I enjoy Stephen White and Johnathan Kellerman but their writing style gets to me sometimes).

B0000AMRJC|1.0|The 1980's as I said many times before was a horrible horrible<BR>decade. The clothes were cheap, the music was cheesy, and worst<BR>of all their were too many mean spirited people. I originally<BR>planned to write this review back on August 2nd 2003, but I lost<BR>track of time, but now I am going to insult this piece of junk<BR>to the maximum. Their was only one good thing about the 1980's,<BR>that was the films, I do not mean those stupid Rambo flicks or<BR>grade b junk starring Chuck Norris or Van Demme or those stupid<BR>teen comedies. However, every decade has great films, so for the<BR>most part the 1980's was really awful. TV in the 1980's was stupid also. Al Pacino's phony Cuban accent is laughable to the<BR>extreme, like it came from a Saturday Night Live sketch, also like the 1980's itself, their is no one to symphatsize with. <BR>I am so glad I live in the 21st century, I am growing up in a time of the internet, DVD players, Playstation 2. The 1980's was<BR>a piece of junk, their was no internet, DVD players, or Playsta-<BR>tion 2, which was awful. It feels great to live in the 21st <BR>century and not a terrible decade like the stupid 1980's. This<BR>movie is stupid. I have always hated the 1980's, in that original review of Gangs OF New York, what I meant was the 1980's made great films just like any decade, but do not get the<BR>wrong idea, I hate the 1980's, it is a worthless, terrible, and<BR>pointless decade. Long live the 21st century and the awesome <BR>technology, the 21st century has to offer. The 1980's is truly<BR>a horrible and terrible decade.

B0001GOH6Q|5.0|This is a great movie, it does have a paper thin thread holding the entire story line together, but that's ok because this movie is about telling lies. The title, loosly translated for everyone that can't understand what &quot;big fish&quot; is refering to, means Big Lie. Don't watch this movie if you want to see Shakesperean art or if you have a hard time following movies like Pulp Fiction, instead watch reruns of Masterpiece Theater in the darkness of your cave. Simply put, if you don't like this movie you a souless zombie lacking all imagination and will to live.
B00006RU5B|4.0|This is the collaboration of the recently disbanded Rage Against The Machine and Chris Cornell, the incredible voice of the also broken up Soundgarden. So, you would think they might make a record that's got a heavy funk rhythm section(RATM), with a powerful rock vocal(Cornell), wouldn't you? Well, no surprises here. That is exactly what you get, and I like it.<br />  For those of you who were fans of Rage, it all depends on why you were a fan whether you appreciate this record or not. If the real appeal for you was Zach De La Rocha's rap-style vocal more than the bombastic groove of the band, then you may not enjoy this release as much as I did(and still do). With Cornell on the mic you get Soundgarden-like song structure, but you still have the perfect groove of Rage. These songs are MUCH less political, and more radio friendly.<br />This is usually a bad thing when it comes to hard rock. So many bands lose their edge when they try to appeal to a more mainstream audience, but I don't believe that's the case here. The edge is still there, just not in every track. These songs aren't experimental in an instrumental sense, or a lyrical sense. They are just typical, serious, well-crafted, straight forward rock songs. We even get quirky guitar wiz Tom Morello playing a straight forward acoustic-like track (see &quot;I Am The<br />Highway&quot;). His experimental playing takes a backseat to Cornell's haunting vocals on many of these songs. I think that Rage realizes what they have in Chris Cornell, and they want to showcase it. All lyrics were written by Cornell, and this is very obvious. In one of the best tracks on the release(&quot;Show Me How To Live&quot;), Cornell rants &quot;Nail in my hand, from my creator, you gave me a life, now show me how to live.&quot; An incredibly powerful lyric, but very different than the Rage lyrics.<br />  All in all, I think the Soundgarden fan will enjoy this much more than the Rage fan. And, fans of just plain good music should enjoy most of this release. Your getting an extremely talented band doing what comes naturally with the situation they have. It's not all good, but for the most part it has a lot to offer.<br />  Check out these best tracks: &quot;Cochise&quot;,&quot;Show Me How To<br />Live&quot;,&quot;Gasoline&quot;,&quot;What You Are&quot;,&quot;Set It Off&quot;, &quot;I Am The Highway&quot;, and &quot;Like A Stone&quot;.<br />OVERALL RATING (1-10;10 being superior): 6<br />For more Dr. Music reviews, visit [...]enjoy most of this release.

Make no mistake, I truly agree with them that the<BR>1980's was a truly truly horrible, pointless, and stupid decade<BR>filled with nothing but cheap clothes, cheesy music, and worst<BR>of all mean spirited people. The 1980's were only good for one<BR>thing that was movies. However, every decade has great movies, it is always a great time for movies. However everything else<BR>of the 1980's was worthless and forgettable. However I realized<BR>that just teaching my friends a lesson of not insulting classic<BR>oscar type films from the past films only hurt myself. For I<BR>accidentally insulted my all time favorite decade which was the<BR>truly truly beautiful and wonderful 21st century. I love I mean<BR>I truly love the 21st century and even when I wrote the one star<BR>review of Gangs Of New York and accidentally insulted my all time favorite decade the 21st century, I did not know what I<BR>was doing. All this stuff that I just said is implied in my<BR>five star March 28th 2004 review of Gangs Of New York, that review features me saying the same stuffI said in my five star<BR>March 28th 2004 review of Gangs Of New York. In the March 28th<BR>2004 five star review of Gangs Of New York, I also implied that<BR>Hollywood is still strong and it is still strong from this day<BR>on. I also learned on July 11th 2003 that Hollywood was always<BR>strong, you see I did not know at the beginning of every year,<BR>Hollywood would release all the stuff nobody is interested in<BR>seeing first, and than by mid February they start to release the<BR>exciting stuff. After that, I felt so bad that I wanted to erase<br />that one star review of Gangs Of New York, but it would not let <BR>me erase the review and I tried to work out the problem for hours but nothing happened. I forgot about it for months, but at<BR>the time I was feeling sad for a few days that I insulted a <BR>decade I truly I mean truly loved which is the wonderful and<BR>beautiful 21st century. However during July 2003, I could not<BR>remember If I wrote an apology review for it still did not warn<BR>my friends of the dangers, but I was feeling better for I was<BR>watching my favorite films, music, and HBO TV from my all time<BR>favorite decade the 21st century. From than on I felt great, <BR>Than on March 28th 2004, I decides to write what I truly truly<BR>thought of Gangs Of New York and my all time favorite decade the<BR>21st century. I wrote down with enthusiasm and honesty that I<BR>not only truly truly love Gangs Of New York, but that I also<BR>truly truly loved my all time favorite decade the 21st century.<BR>Make no mistake I have always loved my all time favorite decade<BR>the 21st century, from the start to present day. I also love<BR>living in my all time favorite decade the 21st century, where<BR>people are nice, and their is truly truly awesome technology<BR>like the internet, DVD players, and Playstation 2. The 1980's<BR>was a horrible, pointless, and stupid decade for it also has<BR>none of the stuff the awesome 21st century had. My all time<BR>favorite decade is the 21st century which is also the one I am<BR>growing up in. I love the 21st century for people are nice, we<BR>have the internet, DVD players, and Playstation 2. I love my<BR>all time favorite decade which is the 21st century, in face I<BR>own the great movies from the 21st century. I own all the DVD's<BR>of the great movies from the 21st century. That is everything<BR>from Erin Brockovich to Lord Of The Rings Return Of The King.<BR>I am telling you the honest honest truth. I love the 21st century, it is my all time favorite decade. I am proud to live<BR>in the 21st century, we get the internet, DVD players, and<BR>Playstation 2. Plus HBO TV is great my favorite ones are The<BR>Sopranos, Oz, Six Feet Under, Curb Your Enthusiasm, and of course Deadwood. I also love the HBO miniseries Band Of Brothers<BR>and Angels In America. Plus people are really nice in my all time favorite decade the 21st century. I am truly being honest<BR>with everything I just said in my review, which is the same thing I did with my March 28th 2004 review of Gangs Of New York.<BR>I am also being honest I mean truly honest I love I mean really<BR>really love the beautiful and wonderful 21st century, which is<BR>my all time favorite decade of all time. All in all the 21st<BR>century is awesome. Long live the 21st century.<br />Reviewed By<BR>John Charet<BR>A.K.A. Cool Dude
B000002H38|5.0|The title says it all....&quot;Rapture&quot; as defined by Webster..&quot;A mystical experience in which the spirt is exalted to a knowledge of divine things&quot;...and listening to Mrs. Bakers vocals thats exactly how i feel ever time i play this cd...a must have....some of the youngsters singing today should take a listen and a lesson
B000089RVX|5.0|I had been hearing this incredible song on the radio, and it was one of those spine-tingling tracks; you know, the ones that give you &quot;goose bumps.&quot; I come to find out that the song is called &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot;, by a band named Evanescence. Obviously, I had to hear this record. I couldn't wait to hear it, but I also &quot;feared&quot; hearing it...afraid it wouldn't be anything close to what I was hoping for. I had such high hopes in mind for this band, I just knew they couldn't live up to my hopes. I have never been more mistaken.<br />  This is one of the best records of this decade, so far, and arguably one of the best Rock records of the past 2 or 3 decades. This is an incredible piece of art.<br />  &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; was the single that introduced this dynamic band to me, and had the intensity that I was hoping they could repeat throughout the rest of the record. I thought if they could come fairly close with half of the record, I would be fortunate. I had my doubts and fears. &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; is one of those tracks that you just know is the best on the album. You can't imagine a better, or even equivalent track to accompany it on the same record. Evanescence puts a full smorgasbord of &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot;-like tracks together here. Every track has some vibrant, intense, colorful or beautiful quality to it. They combine some of the best arrangements done in years with one of the best vocal performances done in decades. Don't get me started on this incredible voice. Amy Lee gives one of the<br />best female singing performances in Rock history on this record. I truly feel this to be true. Listen to the clinic she conducts on &quot;My Immortal&quot; and &quot;Hello&quot;, or the brooding depth she gets to on &quot;Haunted&quot;, with a full choir accompaniment arranged beautifully into the latter track. These are all perfect tracks. As a matter of fact, every track on this masterpiece is perfect. Yes, it is PERFECT. I find nothing, absolutely nothing, I don't like here. When I listen to every track and get &quot;goose bumps&quot;, or when I hear Amy Lee pouring all of her passion into &quot;Hello&quot; and I begin shedding tears, I know I'm listening to something special.<br />  This record touches all of the musical bases also. When the record starts out, it starts with a heavy power chord storm (&quot;Going Under&quot;), and it continues to dabble on the heavier side until the fourth track (&quot;My Immortal&quot;), where it is just Amy Lee and a piano and some light string arrangements. Dazzling. It goes on to one of the best arrangements I've heard in Rock music with &quot;Haunted.&quot; This is a track that is dark, brooding, and even scary at times. When the full choir kicks in, and it becomes an operatic chant as an accompaniment to Ms. Lee's bellowing...it is simply haunting,...hence the title. The record shows you many faces throughout, each face being OH SO PRETTY. It covers all the bases.<br />  Maybe it's got a lyric problem??  Not a chance. The lyrics are just as strong as the music. The artistic lyrics of &quot;Imaginary&quot;, or the captivating religious yearnings heard in &quot;Tourniquet&quot; are all done with class and precision. Experience these words:<br />  &quot;In my field of paper flowers,<br />  And candy clouds of lullaby,<br />  I lie inside myself for hours,<br />  And watch my purple sky fly over me.&quot;<br />  (&quot;Imaginary&quot;)<br /><br />  The entire album has lyrics this artistic and passionate. With Amy Lee singing &quot;Mary Had A Little Lamb&quot; it would be worth listening to, but she's provided with lyrics such as the ones above, and it's simply magical. This is a record for all ages, for all styles of Rock music lovers,...this is a record for all time. Go get it, experience it, feel it reach into your soul and not let go.<br />  Before I give you the overall rating, let me leave you with another lyric. This one is from &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot;:<br />  &quot;How can you see into my eyes like open doors,<br />  Leading you down into my core,<br />  Where I've become so numb without a soul,<br />  My spirit sleeping somewhere cold,<br />  Until you find it there and lead it back home.&quot;<br />  Wake your spirit up, and lead it home to this record.<br />  OVERALL RATING:  10  PERFECT!

B0001Z52RU|5.0|I went and seen The Butterfly Effect in theaters and then I bought it and just got done watching it again. When I see a movie in theaters then watch it on DVD or TV it just isn't as  good as the 1st time. Well with The Butterfly Effect it was better the 2nd time around. I can not explain it in any other way then this is just a great movie. It will grab ahold of you and not let go till the end. I watched Ashton Kutcher on Punked and figured it would be hard to see him in any other way but he does a great job in the movie at making you believe that he is Evan. The DVD has ok features with the directors' cut being the best one. The music in the movie was picked perfect for the scenes. Don't Stop Crying by Oasis plays at the end of the movie in the theatrical version and I must say what a good song. For all of you out there who haven't seen this movie yet you are missing out. For you all that don't like this movie you would not know a good movie if it hit you in the ass. Final words are The Butterfly Effect will stand the test of time and be remembered for a great movie.
B00005JM0B|2.0|Director Jonathan Mostow (Breakdown, U-571) has taken over in the director's chair for this vastly disappointing third instal-<BR>lment of the Terminator series. Director James Cameron did not<BR>want to do any more Terminator films, so did they need to conti-<BR>nue the story? No, they did not. Just like Arnold Schwarzene-<BR>gger's last flick Collateral Damage, this one is just inferior<BR>rehases of his better films like the first two Terminator's and<BR>Predator, and Total Recall, which are better films. Schwarzenegger does his best as usual, but he feels like such<BR>a wimp here. His Terminator character is too much of a wussie<BR>here. All he does here is spout cliched one liners, while the<BR>character of John Connor (Played this time by Nick Stahl) is<BR>being stalked by the T-X Terminatrix (Played by a beautiful loo-<BR>king Kristanna Loken). She is the only one who tries to provide new material for the Terminator franchise. The ending is also too depressing and anti climactic for the series. The Matrix<BR>Revolutions was disappointing, but at least that ended more in<BR>a way that was satisfying, this just feels too rushed and unfi-<BR>nished. Like The Alien series, this should have stopped after the second one. Schwarzenegger still has talent, but he is re-<BR>duced to doing cliched flicks. You want a great action movie<BR>see The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, and Crouching Tiger Hidden<BR>Dragon. You want Nick Stahl's best performance see Todd Field's<BR>In The Bedroom and HBO's miniseries Carnivale. As for this,<BR>skip this one and see the first two Terminator films.<br />Reviewed by<BR>John Charet<BR>A.K.A. Cool Dude
B00028HBKM|5.0|I just ordered the DVD today, and I know I won't regret it.  There's been a lot of controversy surrounding this film, but when all is said and done the dollars speak for themselves.  \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is a must see movie for all denominations and faiths.  Not only will you find yourself either weeping or wanting to weep, but you will come away with the feeling that Christ went through all of that for all of us.  And he went through all of that as the Son of Man.  When I saw this in the theater I turned to my fiance and said, \\"Wow.\\"  I had no other word for it at the time.<br />And as far as the anti-Semitic controversy -- the way I see it, there were both good and bad Jews in the film, just as there were in the actual story (remember, there were many along the path who were helping him as well as cursing him because they didn't know who he was).  If Gibson didn't show that, it would be like making a World War II movie without having the Japanese or Germans as the bad guys.<br />Overall, this movie very quickly moved to the #1 spot of my all time favorite films after I saw it.
B00003CXCT|1.0|To be fair I must state I havent seen these yet as they havent come out yet. But I do know these are the horrid special editions. If you grew up watching star wars then steer clear of these but if you didnt maybe then seeing the changes and alterations wouldnt bother you.<br />Personally I refuse to buy these. I hated the changes made and not one single alteration was for the better of the movies and just lowered my perception of lucas which hit rock bottom when his prequels were released.<br />Go rent or buy the old vhs orginal versions which are easily found or buy the indiana jones set if your itching for dvd quality lucas.
0321200683|5.0|Overall I am quite impressed with the quality of this book. The authors took a great look at the patterns involved in messaging architectures as traditionally practiced in EAI applications. If you are an experienced architect, you will find the patterns applied to many enterprise applications. If you don't have a few large-scale type projects under your belt, you won't think many of the suggestions are useful, applicable, or even necessary. If you do, though, reading this book will be well worth your time.
B0001GOH6Q|1.0|My wife and I were very excited to see this movie after seeing the preview.  We were very disappointed.  The storyline and the dialogue are terrible.  The acting, the sets, the special effects, and the music were all very good.  But in my book, NONE of those things can make up for a bad script, and they did not make up for Big Fish's very bad script.
B00024W1D8|2.0|Ashton Kutcher &amp; Amy Smart are poorly casted in this very science fiction film.<BR>What if you could change the events of your life by say just thinking about them?!<BR>Well apparently here you can travel back in time,hop in your former self and say a few choice words and BAM! the course of your life is changed.<BR>Oh christ this movie is such a jumble of ideas blended together all for the greater good of....love(moan)<BR>Wait theres more whilst jumping back and forth and back again Kutcher screws up again and again and again so much so that every time he returns to present day something is wrong and/or worse in his or someone elses life.<BR>Mainly he is doing this for his long lost childhood love played by Smart with wooden and emotionless zeal but he also has a few friends centered around a few incidents that have forever changed their young lives.<BR>None of these events can he remember(said yoda)which makes him less dysfunctional than the grownup incarnations of said friends.<BR>Wait theres more did I mention that Kutchers charactor as a child also suffered from severe blackouts every time something bad was about to happen?!?<BR>Yup his doctor forces hime to keep a journal as a boy hoping that eventually this will help jog his memory which is how when he is in college hes able to re read these marble notebooks and BAM! (again?!) the little bits in between that he cannot remember are literally forced on him  in the flesh as he is teleported  back in time.<BR>This movie trys to be hard hitting,intelligent,visceral,deep and ponderous all at once and fails at every turn.<BR>The screen writers dont have a clue what the subject matter is here or how to translate it nor do the directors have any idea how to make these transistions from past to present work in the context of a 120 minutes worth of film.<BR>This would have worked better without the blundering of quantum physics and the possibilities of time travel.<BR>If you dont beleive me look up Stephen Hawkins and try to hold onto your sanity because this man is decades ahead of eveyone in this field and as a layman personally I have only the most basic understanding of quantum physics and The Butterfly Effect offended me as do most tv and movie renderings of such.<BR>There is only one movie that combines all the elments of this movie plus what it means in very basic terms to time travel by Hawkins definition and that movie is the BRILLIANT but overlooked and underated Donnie Darko.<BR>No doubt the makers of The Butterfly Effect watched and ripped off Darko,I mean direct scenes just lifted with no care for the source material in either capacity.<BR>If you know nothing of physics quantum or otherwise you will probally love this movie.<BR>me I was annoyed by the inept fuzzy logic of it all.<BR>By the way the kids who played the young Smart And Kutcher are WAY better than their big star leads.<BR>Acting and chemistry wise these children could have carried this movie easy minus all the hocus pocus hog wash the makers of this movie try to shove down your throat as fact.<BR>The dvd has both a directors cut and original theatrical versions of this movie however neither make this crap go down any easier.
B00005JMYG|4.0|Will Ferrell is back in another silly movie.  This time it works.  Although, Ferrell is not the one getting all of the laughs.  No no, this anchorman better believe there is no I in team because he is lost without them.<br />The story begins with a little telling of the legend of an anchorman named Ron Burgundy (Ferrell).  His news team includes Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), Champ Kind (David Koechner), and Brick Tamland (Steven Carell).  This foursome brings the San Diego news to people every night.  Oh, and Burgundy is a five time Emmy winner for his desk job.  <br />All is working great.  The teamwork, cohesiveness, fun, and high-spirits are in full gear.  Then, a threat arrives.  Oh no, it's a woman named Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate).  Corningstone is quick to find herself in the same situation that she has faced in past experiences.  Nobody feels that a woman is capable for anything except something for eyes to feast on.  <br />It turns out, that Burgundy and Corningstone share more than a professional relationship with each other.  This leads Bugundy turning his team into a quartet to sing about love.  One of the cooler parts of the film.  However, this relationship is ruined when Corningstone takes over the desk job and Burgundy loses his job.  To not ruin the movie, I will not discuss the details that lead up to this moment.  <br />However, in the end, the whole team must figure out a way to catch the biggest story of the summer, which involves a panda giving birth at the San Diego Zoo.  What would  a movie be without competition?  Not only must the team compete with itself, but also other news stations.  Who will win???<br />As the title shows, Anchorman would be nothing without the supporting cast.  Sure, Ferrell has some good one-liners and funny moments, but it doesn't compare to some other parts that the other people provide.  For instance, at the beginning, they show the opening segment of how the news begins by introducing all of the sections of the news.  To see Paul Rudd walk in to the shot and start strutting was funny in itself.<br />Christina Applegate has grown up from the Kelly Bundy era.  She in no longer a dumb, pretty, blonde girl; she is a smart, pretty, blonde girl that likes the news.  Her prescence not only made the news better, it made the film better.  She was definitely able to hold her own in the mixture of all the boys.<br />The best character in the movie has to go to Steven Carell's Brick.  Brick mentions he has an I.Q. somewhere in the 40s, and it shows.  They made this character into a really stupid person, but that is totally ok.  He made me and the rest of the audience laugh more than anything.  Remember the scene in Bruce Almighty where Bruce makes the anchorman do really crazy things?  Well, that's who Steven Carell is.  Here, he is used to perfection.<br />To me, the best scene in the movie involved a brawl between news teams from different channels.  This scene has a lot of cameos in it.  The main thing is the amount of laughs.  My eyes were seriously watering because I was laughing so much during this 5 to 6 minute segment and few minutes following.  It was that good.  <br />Another good scene involves Ron's dog (yet another great supporting member that saves the film).  It involves the dog having a conversation with a Kodiak bear.  My friend thought this was the best part of the movie.  I will have to agree that is was funny, although, my laughter may have been towards laughing at him for laughing so hard.  Either way, it's still funny.<br />There were parts in the film that were not to my liking.  For instance, there was like this dream sequence that looked like something from an Adam Sandler movie.  There was also a few dry spots were it is just Ron that are kind of dull.  However, that is not enough to not recommend this film.  Overall, it was a funny movie.  If anything, go to see Steven Carell as Brick.  He's one of the characters that are supposed to be stupid andcould either be seen as annoying or great.  Luckily, it worked out for the best.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|a big-hearted fantasy that includes much of what Disney usually leaves out: namely, all the quirkiness and tragedy involved in life. Refreshing.
B00008EY9G|5.0|This movie is hard to talk about because you don't want to give a second of it away. I've seen a lot of movies and I'd give this one a A+. Even if you have your doubts about buying it I would fully suggest you buy and be amazed at this masterpiece.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|There is no way you can completely understand this movie with just one viewing.  The first time I saw I left thinking &quot;What the hell just happened&quot;<BR>I saw the DVD and it all came together.  <BR>The war between the humans and machines makes perfect sense.  The Humans don't want their human brethren enslaved by the machines to be used as power..and the machines don't want the humans to take away their only source of life giving energy.<BR>The chosen one is found and does what no other human in the Matrix has ever done..defeated an agent.  However when he defeats Smith he makes a mistake, he basically turns smith into an anomliss program, he is no longer controlled by the Matrix but is self aware and pissed off.  <BR>The war between the machines and the humans escalates into one final battle, which does not bode well for the humans. <BR>Neo after being grievsly injured by Smith who has taken over the bodie of a human in the real world makes his way to the machine world with an offer.  End the war and he will defeat Smith who has completely taken over the Matrix and threatens to destroy it if the machines will end the war with humanity.  The Machines plug directly into Neo(every port) and he is jacked into the Matrix for the final fight with Smith.  In the end Neo realizes he can't win the fight and lets Smith absorb him which then gives the machines direct access to Smith(because Neo is plugged in)and destroys him once and for all restoring the Matrix.  The machines call off their army and the war is over, with the understanding that any that want to be unplugged can be.
B00005JMCT|5.0|This is a great conclusion to all of the American Pie moives. The jokes are more sharp the before. Adam Herz did a great job of writting the finale to the trilogy. Stifler has more depth in this movie thn he had in the other 2. He is funnier and is more of a jerk than before.Also Jim is funnier and just a lil more perverted which is kind of hard to believe but it's true. Michelle is still the same nympho in the movie but has some funny scenes. Finch just made me laugh out loud of some of the things he gets into in this movie. Kevin has not that many scenes but he is still funny in this movie. Jim's dad is still the same funny guy like always but he is more funny than before, thank you Eugene Levy who plays that part you did a great job. And the movie soars with the addition of Michelle's parents ( Actors Fred Willard and Deborah Rush). The funniest scene has to be the right after the bachelor party when Jim and Michelle's parents are cluless of what just happened at Jim's house. But i will leave what happens in that scene to you all. The bonus material on the dvd is great. They have delated scenes, funny outakes, a documeantary on how stifler speaks, and more! What is also great about this dvd is that it has the rated version and the unrated version. So those who didnt see the movie in the theater can see the theatrical release( rated version) and the one with new scenes and extended parts of scenes(unrated version). The commentary is funny too. Sean William Scott and Jesse Dylan commentate and on the other feature commentary is Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan, Eddie Kaye Thomas, and Thomas Ian Nicholas all comentating on the movie( in my opinion the one with the 4 actors is funnier thant the one with Sean and Jesse but my opinion about that doesnt really count cause its up to you the one who buys this movie) All of the acotrs in this movie do great jobs and this is a deffinete must buy for ur DVD collection. So what are you waiting for go buy this movie now!
B00005JMYG|2.0|I was very dissapointed in this movie.  I was so looking forward to seeing it and I am a huge Will Ferrell fan, but this movie was so dry and terrible.  I got a few chuckles throughout the movie but that was it. If you really want to see it, don't waste your money, wait until it come out on video.  I am sure it will be soon.
B00003CXXM|4.0|I was in the mood to watch an entertaining action flick that hopefully had some brains behind it, so I decided to pop &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; into my DVD player (that, and the previews for the sequel looks really good, so I wanted to see this right away).  What I got was exactly what I expected, and then some.  This is a very exciting and sharp movie that is a lot of fun to watch.  There's lots of intense action to be enjoyed from this film.<br />Jason Bourne has a serious problem on his hands.  When he is left for dead and his body is discovered by fishermen, he awakes and realizes that he cannot remember who he is.  His memory is gone and he has no idea why or how he's there.  And even though he doesn't know who he is, he is very skilled at hand-to-hand combat and is a deadly weapon who can take down just about anyone.  When he tries to uncover his past and his identity, he finds people around every corner trying to kill him.  Turns out that he is in reality an agent/assassin for the U.S. government (a very secret branch of defense).  Since Bourne had failed his mission, they cannot afford to have him found out by others, so they know he must be terminated.  Well, Bourne isn't going to take that lightly.  He will take them head on and bring the fight to their doorsteps in order to find out who he is and why they want him dead.<br />This really was a good time.  I haven't been terribly impressed with some of the latest action blunders, so it was nice to see something that was entertaining and was actually smart at the same time.  Another plus is that the film doesn't try to be overly goofy, as a lot of other action flicks tend to be at times.  Granted, there is humor, but it's evenly spread out and is never overused.  Not only does the film have incredible action and fight scenes, but it also has a smart script and great character interaction.  The movie also shows that Matt Damon can be one heck of an action star.  I thought he could never pull it off, but he sure proved me wrong.  He's very believable in his role and he's able to pull of the action scenes with real authenticity.<br />The DVD has a few extras to offer.  First off, the movie looks very good and the sound is also terrific.  Extras that can be found on this DVD include commentary from the director, an alternate ending and an extended &quot;farmhouse&quot; scene, deleted scenes, a making-of featurette, a great music video by Moby, and some really neat DVD-ROM extras.  I didn't care much for the alternate ending, so I'm glad that they just stuck with what is in the movie.  All in all, not a bad package.<br />&quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; can be enjoyed by those who want a smart and clever action movie that delivers.  There's a great script, a fantastic cast, and some out-of-this-world chase/fight scenes.  This was definitely a great time for me and I'm glad I finally got around to watching it.  If you haven't checked it out yet, then I really recommend it, especially if you're an action fan. -Michael Cranehe sure proved me wrong.

B00004C8TC|5.0|I bought this CD for another rendition of Grieg's concerto, but now I listen to it again and again for the Schumann; what a wonderful composition! I had not heard of Lupu until I purchased this CD, but I would now seek out other recordings of his. I highly recommend it.
B00005JMYG|5.0|Anchorman is such a delightful satire!  Seeing it is a great way to spend a hot afternoon at the movies!  I could really relate to the movie because in the 70's, when this movie takes place, that's really how it was with TV stations and anchormen!  Congratulations to a super cast who had a very well written, very funny script to work with.  Will Ferrell and Christina Applegate were terrific!
0140277447|2.0|While Chang's narrative is compelling, the fact that she compiled most of her information from Chinese sources and uses Chinese government estimates leaves a great deal of doubt with regard to many of her assertions. Real historians have cringed at many of her suppositions, but the most ridiculous part of the book is when Chang plays armchair psychologist to explain the Japanese mindset. I would balance this book with Honda's to gain a little perspective. Still waiting for a good book on the subject by an actual historian without an agenda.
B00003CX95|1.0|Mel Gibson must be a very disturbed man. All his films are very violent. \\"Payback\\", \\"The Patriot\\" and \\"The Passion of Christ\\"(which at least I found to be pretty funny though I don't think it was meant to be) all glorify violence.<br />Catherine McCormack takes off her clothes in this film which is why I give it 1 star and not 0. Unfortunately Sophie Marceau doesn't take off her clothes and even more unfortunate is that Mel does. I found the mooning scene in this movie to be quite childish<br />This movie is intended for the less intelligent American market rather than for us Scots. All of Mel Gibsons recent films are marketed towards less intelligent people such as George W Bush or the Pope or Mel himself I suppose.<br />Mel Gibson hasn't made a decent film since \\"Mad Max 2\\" yet he continues to make millions of dollars making these awful films.<br />I guess...<BR>YOU CAN TAKE MY TALENT BUT YOU CAN'T TAKE MY MILLIONS!!!!

B00005V3Z4|5.0|Absolutely one of the best movies of this generation. Two things will occur to you after watching this movie for the first time.  The first is that you will want to discuss the movie in detail with anyone who has seen it. And the second is that you will want to watch the movie again to try to answer questions you have come up with.  As far as the meaning of the movie, I would have to say that is up to you to decide.  I have seen this movie end to end probably 30 times, even once with the comentary on and each time I have come away with a different theory of what is going on.  Though I try to stay away from pop culture I am very excited to see this movie come back into the light.  Even if the movie is a bit to deep sounding for your tastes try it out.  I mean come on it has everything from anarchistic destruction of schools, to Patrick Swayze as a child molester, to political debates at dinner.  A fantasy that feels so real it's scary and don't forget the broad cast of amazing actors and actresses, I suggest getting the DVD so you don't have to worry about it wearing out from constant use.  <br />And for any of you out there that watch Donnie Darko and for whatever reason don't think it is amazing do the world a favor and go back to watching the Ashley Simpson Show and &quot;Chutt Up&quot;!!
B00008J4P5|3.0|I almost bought this c.d when I stopped to listen to all of the songs on the preview thing. Well this c.d is extremely inconsistent. I mean I simply love Seven Nation Army. It is one of my favorite songs. Fell in Love with a girl is another good song and the song there is no room for you here is decent. All the other songs are just plain boring and make you fall asleep. In my opinion if I am going to buy a c.d I have to like all the songs. They realize they only have a few good songs out there if they put a little more effort they might have a c.d I would buy. I like the White Stripes and there c.d covers are great and so is SOME of there music but if they want my money they need to be more consistent.
B0002B15PG|2.0|This is a movie that threw away all the potential it had to be at least better than average. We are introduced to Captain Aubrey and his crew, who are chasing down a French ship and constantly being thwarted. And that's it. By about halfway through the movie, one wonders when this chase will get interesting, or if it will harken back to the good old days of pirate movies, ala Errol Flynn. It does neither. The characters are so bland that the names are even hard to recall.<br />The movie's one redeeming quality, and why I gave it two stars instead of one, was the historical accuracy involved. We get a glimpse into the past that is neither overblown or trite. However, even a documentary needs interesting commentary.
B00003CXCT|1.0|When Lucas first created the Star Wars concept it was ostensibly an homage to the movies of the past. How unfortunate that when releasing the DVD versions of these films he's not taking into account the nostaglia we original viewers felt at seeing the movies as they were first released. Having seen the \\"updated versions\\" of the films all the new footage did was detract from the \\"nostalgia\\" of the originals. I wouldn't accept the new versions as a gift and I certainly wouldn't pay for them. Sorry George... you're not getting a penny of mu money until you release the original versions on DVD.

0767817478|1.0|Whether or not you perceive him as a hero or villain, there's no doubt that Godzilla has become a global name. The old Godzilla movies have always been known for their outlandish storylines, cheesy special effects, fake costumes and sets, and overall lack of realism. But in the end, they were still surprisingly entertaining. Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich try to achieve that same notion with their own version of the monster. The 'campy but fun' formula worked well with the old Godzilla, but it fails miserably with this one. The old Godzilla movies may have been cheesy, but at least they aspired to be good, fun and charming. They weren't shallow and soulless and all were made with a technique that worked. You can tell the filmmakers tried. Too bad it's not the same case here.<br />It's difficult to watch this movie and not compare it to the original Toho creation. The Toho Godzilla movies featured gibberish plots and obviously fake laughable production, but at least they didn't insult your intelligence. This Godzilla film showcases absolutely no hint of logic, especially regarding the size of the creature. We can see Godzilla towering over New York's tallest skyscrapers yet it can fit in the subway tunnels and evenly distribute eggs inside Madison Square Garden. As usual, the military is always determined to destroy a monster in a monster movie, but here they are made to look like a bunch of bumbling idiots, always being outwitted and losing track of a creature that size in Manhattan. Godzilla has the ability to breathe fire, yet he doesn't even use it. The characters serve no purpose here except to witness Godzilla get assaulted and killed. It's one ridiculous action scene after another. To top it all off, the soundtrack of the movie has Puff Daddy butchering the riff of Led Zeppelin's 'Kashmir'.<br />It's not common for many movies to deserve one star. Godzilla is one of those movies. There's nothing wrong with creating a Godzilla movie or any cheesy monster flick, it just has to be executed correctly. The Japanese makers of Godzilla make Devlin and Emmerich look like amateurs. There is no heart to this film whatsoever, a ploy to cash in on an already infamous hero to many. A lizard arrives in a city, is angered and attacked by humans and dies. Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich prove once again that they are two of the worst filmmakers in history. They take cult classic genres and turn them into mainstream abominations enhanced with action-oriented special effects. Independence Day was a disgrace to sci-fi alien invasion movies and now this. The original 1954 Godzilla and Godzilla 1985 were no masterpieces, but they were still far more entertaining than this one. Look past the dull action scenes and special effects, and the rest of the movie's attributes wear thin quickly (like most of Devlin and Emmerich's work). This is a bad movie, but most of all, it's empty and downright forgettable.ck, it just has to be executed correctly. The Japanese makers of Godzilla make Devlin and Emmerich look like amateurs.

B0001Z52RU|2.0|Character development was not very good.  I found myself not especially liking or having a reason to like any of the characters in the movie. They seemed all so shallow and self-centered.  The movie jumps back and forth so much it seems like the people who made the movie may have been on drugs of some kind.   Creative idea for a movie, but what does the magic in the movie have to do with Chaos Theory?  This should be more thoroughly explained, right??<br />Kutcher is a great &quot;bad boy&quot; actor..that is about the only talent in the film.

B000089RVX|5.0|I totally love everything about Evanescence. Amy's vocals, David's piano, Ben's guitar... everything.<br />Here are my song reviews:<br />Going Under - The worst song on the album... but that's not saying much. Written by Amy after breaking up with a childhood boyfriend.<BR> <BR>Bring Me To Life - The demo was better than this...<br />Written by Amy.<br />Everybody's Fool - The best, and most under-rated single. Written by Amy, to her sister Carrie.<br />My Immortal - I'll take the Origin version over this one. Written by Ben.<br />Haunted - Nice goth feel to it. Written by Ben.<br />Tourniquet - Written by drummer Rocky Gray, for his band Soul Embraced. One of their best songs.<br />Imaginary - Another good song. Written by Amy.<br />Taking Over Me - Good effort, written by guitarist John Lecompt.<br />Hello - Best song on the album. Written by Amy as a tribute to her sister Bonnie.<br />My Last Breath - Ok song, written by Amy.<br />Whisper - The Origin version is much better...<br />Written by Ben and Amy.
0446677450|1.0|&quot;Rich Dad&quot; is one of the worst books I have ever read. If you are not a member of the Kyosaki cult and care to know why, read on.<br />My beef with this book is that it doesn't do what it claims to do. There is very little advice and information in this book. It does NOT tell you what the &quot;rich tell their kids&quot;, it does not give you a roadmap or even well structured ideas as to what you need to do to put yourself on the road to financial well being. All I was able to get out of the book are some general statements that things will go well if I invest. Invest in what? Invest how? Kyosaki's boastful stories, which are liberally used throughout the book, do very little to provide any real information.<br />This is not the book that I was looking for, and I suspect that it is not the one you want either.<br />Try instead &quot;Smart Couples Finish Rich&quot;. Now that's a book that has something real to say. Enjoy.

B00000DG1R|4.0|Apparently there are lots of reviewers on Amazon saying that they think Duran Duran is bad. And everytime people mention the eighties, there always seem to be someone laughing at how music and fashion were in those days. If you don't like the fashion because the colours are wrong, fine. If you don't like the music because the synthesizers scare you, fine. But if you say you don't like it just because it's old, then YOU are the problem!<BR>I'll let you think just what you want about the 80's as long as you have another reason than \\"it's too old\\". If you lived at the time and you think it wasn't good, then you have every right to think so. Or if the music just isn't your kind, then everybody must respect that. But if the only actual reason for you not liking it, is that it happens to have been made a couple of years, decades or even centuries ago, then you simply have no taste. Maybe you're just trying to be popular by following the modern fads, is that it? Well if you like what's on MTV right now, you can start telling yourself that you don't know anything about music in itself, becuase that's a fact.<BR>I was born in 1987, so I don't remember much of the 80's at all. Most of my friends find 80's stuff too strange for them. But I like it.<BR>I didn't grow up during the 80's, my parents don't listen to 80's music. Actually, there's no particular reason for me liking the 80's, but I do! And I also like the 60's and 70's. I'm a teenager of the 21st century, and I like what I missed. Ironic like hell, but the 80's is one of many tastes of music and style, and that is more than you're ever going to have if you keep disliking stuff that isn't new. I see that one of you advice us to buy AudioSlave's new album instead. Will you like that album by 2008? So listen you taste-less non-polite whoever-you-are, if you don't like the music you bought this year at the day you grow old, I'll be glad to laugh at you for all the huge ammounts of money you wasted on albums you can't seemto like more than as long as it's being advertised. Just leave music and put your money on something that you understand.<br />Duran Duran is almost just what I like when it comes to music and style. So my personal opinion will be 4 stars out of 5.
B0000DD7LC|3.0|First off, I wasn't amazed by her last album. So I came into this one with lower expectations than most people. And once again, Alicia gives us a slightly above average. But nothing great - nothing up to the level of her talent. She continues to underwhelm. We are still waiting for that breakout album.
1592400876|4.0|EATS, SHOOTS AND LEAVES: THE ZERO-TOLERANCE APPROACH TO PUNCTUATION by Lynne Truss is a funny, quotable, quip-laden smidge of a book by a &quot;fellow traveler&quot; of mine: a copy editor.<br />The book's title comes from this bar joke that's made the rounds:<br />A panda walks into a restaurant, sits down, and orders a sandwich. He eats the sandwich, pulls out a gun, and shoots the waiter dead. As the panda stands up to go, the manager shouts, &quot;Hey! Where are you going? You just shot my waiter, and you didn't even pay for your sandwich!&quot;<br />&quot;Hey, man, I'm a PANDA!&quot; the panda shouts back. &quot;Look it up!&quot;<br />The manager opens his dictionary and reads:<br />Panda: A tree-dwelling marsupial of Asian origin, characterized by distinct black and white coloring. Eats, shoots and leaves.<br />The comma in the punchline is exactly the kind of misplaced punctuation that drives Truss to distraction, and her efforts to protect the English language from similar abuse were the impetus for this book. In an early chapter, Truss advocates punctuation guerillas to go out and about and take care of things like the missing apostrophe in the &quot;Two Weeks Notice&quot; movie posters.<br />While it's not a reference book or an exhaustive guide, EATS, SHOOTS AND LEAVES provides a funny general guideline for punctuation along with a charming history of related language, printing and linguistic traditions and standards. (For example, do you know what an &quot;interrobang&quot; is, or the meaning of the meaning of the word &quot;hypen&quot; in its orginal Greek?) Truss forms chapters thematically around various punctuation marks, outlines their uses and gives practical and humorous examples. The last chapter addresses the electronic age's influence on writing and punctuation.<br />This would be a good book to own, as it is very quotable and the sources Truss uses to make her case and inform readers of the why's and wherefore's are a good resource for interested parties. While I was aware of most of the rules of which Truss writes, I was very interested in this kind of linguistical lesson.<br />One caveat I have about the book is that it is a British book, so some rules aren't consistent with standard American English. Also Truss doesn't follow my preferred AP style, as I noted when she wrote &quot;email&quot; instead of &quot;e-mail,&quot; &quot;internet&quot; instead of &quot;Internet&quot; and &quot;website&quot; instead of &quot;Web site.&quot; So, as I said, it's not a style guide, but it's an enjoyable, generally informative guide for those who love language, like to read about it and like to know there's someone else out there who notices signs like &quot;book's for sale&quot; and cringes.d parties.

B0001AP12G|4.0|Prior the The College Dropout, nobody Kanye West and his production skills more than me. I was becoming a big fan from his work with Jay-Z. So it goes with out saying that I picked this one up on the day it was released. After major expectations for The College Dropout, I was underwhelmed. More than that, I was almost downright disappointed. Kind of like the disappointed on the day I bought The Neptunes' The Clones. But fortunately, there is enough here to keep this album just a hair above the average album. I still maintain that West is the most skilled producer in the game today. But this one was ALMOST DISAPPOINTING. I expect more from his second album - much more.
B00005JKQZ|3.0|Let's be clear from the start:  This is a movie about A Nobel Prize winning mathematician that suffers from schizophrenia named John Nash.  However, this is not the true-life story of THE John Nash, a Nobel Prize winning mathematician that suffers from schizophrenia.  Nor is this the screen adaptation of the book &quot;A Beautiful Mind,&quot; by Sylvia Nasar.  The two share a title, a mental illness, and character names but little else.<br />That said, the movie does an excellent job of portraying the life of a promenant individual who suffered from many classic symptoms of schizophrenia in the 60's &amp; 70's.  But it does not present the illness from both sides equally.  We see how the main character (not named in this section to avoid confusion) is afflicted, but we do not see enough of what those around him see.  Nor does it quite arrive at showing how glorious the &quot;light at the end of tunnel&quot; is after decades of fighting the darkness.<br />The movie does not discuss John &amp; Alicia's real-life divorce, the repeated coast-to-coast trips, or the years John spent living in Europe.  And definately does not offer any hints at John's experiments with homosexuality (discussed at length in the text, but reportedly excluded at Nash's request).<br />In short, this movie is a starting place for future movies about mental illness, but is not an end-all experience.

B0001MDP3G|4.0|Cold Mountain is worth watching for no other reason than the sheer pleasure you'll get from Renee Zelleweger in the role of \\"Ruby!\\"  I admit to being a Zelleweger fan, however, Ruby is unlike any other role she's taken on.  As others have written, some scenes will stay with you days after you see the movie, and you just might want to view it again, and again.   <br />Nicole Kidman was entirely too beautiful in this film.  Her rosy cheeks, pale skin, blue eye-shadowed eyes and perfectly colored blonde hair were simply too unbelievable for the period.  She's never looked more beautiful in any movie she's been in, and the make-up artist should have saved her talents for a more appropriate role, say, one where Nicole enters and wins the Miss Universe pagent.
B0000025F7|4.0|Certainly not thiller, but better than most albums released today. Best tracks includes Off The Wall, I Can't Help It and Rock With You. Only track that misses for me is Burn This Disco Out.
B00005YW4H|2.0|Norah Jones... either she ought to have her deviated septum fixed or she was suffering from a head cold when she cut this album.  In either case, perhaps Amazon should put together a two-cd deal featuring Norah Jones and one of Jonathan Richman's records.  Stuffy-nose pop fans, rejoice!<br />But seriously folks, this stuff is not music.  If you want to hear comatose jazz stylings, check out Blossom Dearie Sings Comden and Green or her version of Someone to Watch Over Me.  This is pure heroin.  You bang it in the mainline and fall back on the flophouse bed with the hypo still sticking out of your arm.  Norah Jones, on the other hand, is not satisfied until her tracks ramp up to some up-tempo peak of countryfication.  Just so you know she means it when she whispers out, &quot;Cub away wif be... inna dight.&quot;  Sounds suspiciously like the cold sufferer on a Nyquil commercial.
B000084T18|4.0|This album proves two things: Dr. Dre is the single best hip-hop producer in history and 50 Cent is one the most marketable artists on the scene today. And trust me, his lyrical skills aren't shabby either. Granted, he's no Jay-Z, Eminem or Nas. But he is an above average lyricist. You will be pleased with this one.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I saw this film back in September 2003 and am now posting my original review.<br />\\"Lost In Translation\\" is the best film of 2003 without a doubt. It is the most original film in years, and Sofia Coppola directs and writes with a perfect artistry. Now, here is a love story that doesn't involve the sheets and messy bed linens that lie around the hotel in the morning, the lovers each wearing robes. It is proof that a film romance can survive without the corny and unnecessary, conventional sex scene. Then again, Bill Murray in that kind of situation would be a little disturbing.<br />The plot of \\"Lost in Translation\\" is simple. That is because it is not a plot-driven film, but it is a character and dialogue driven film. Bill Murray plays Bob Harris, a has-been American movie star staying at a hotel in Tokyo to shoot a Japanese whiskey commercial. His wife and children back at home could care less about him and Bob feels unwanted and lonely. That is, until he meets Charlotte (played by the incredible 18 year-old Scarlett Johansson), the wife of a vain fashion photographer (Ribisi) who is shooting in Tokyo. He is oblivious to his young wife's unhappiness and sadness, and Charlotte is also lost in life. She doesn't know what to be even though she has graduated from Yale in Philosophy. Charlotte and Bob each wander the streets of Tokyo, and the making of the whiskey commercial is hilarious. Neither can sleep and they meet one restless night in the hotel bar, and they instantly click. They do not become passionate lovers, though. The two become friends immediately and take off on adventures in the city, being weary of the hotel. It is obvious that they fall in love, but there is no steamy make out scene and there is no wildly hot sex scene to go along with it. No. The film is perfect without it.<br />Everything about this film is just so wonderful. Coppola has proven herself to be one of the strongest female women in the directing and writing industry of film. Her last film, \\"The Virgin Suicides,\\" was also a great film, but this one is even better. Sofia has more control and confidence in her work now. The dialogue is witty, as are the performances. Murray has never been better and breaks his stereotypical image of comedian. Johansson has come out of the dark and will certainly be one of the best actresses in the future. She is already one of the best actresses of this generation, and her performance in this film is literally flawless. There aren't many characters in this film, and I could understand why an audience might be bored and leave the theater. Well, first of all, learn to research into a movie before you waste your hard earned money on purchasing a ticket. Second of all, there is a lot to think and understand about this film. People who don't \\"get\\" it do not take much time to really consider and think about it.<br />The production of this film is interesting and appealing. The look is fantastic, and the cinematography gets the audience right into what is going on in the character's heads. It's so charming. The music is very 80s-like and sets a perfect setting for the film. Tokyo comes to life as it never has before on the screen. I love it!<br />\\"Lost in Translation\\" is a film about loneliness, and isn't depressing and conventional. It completely deserved the Oscar for best picture of the year. \\"Lost\\" is totally perfect, and the best film of the year. I didn't even have to think twice about that one.
B0000025RI|5.0|Let me state first that I have never been a big fan of Michael Jackson. And when this album was released in '82, I though that it was extremely overhyped. But I'll say that twenty or so years later, this is the single best album I have ever heard. Every song stands on its own. And the one song, Baby Be Mine, that got the least airplay in the '80s can arguably be considered one of the best two or three songs on the album. the best and worst songs on the album are not that far apart. You can't say that about too many albums. Classic is an understatement. Greatest album ever assembled.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Bravo to Mel Gibson for standing up to the criticism of Hollywood, and all of the non-believers out there! This is honestly the BEST film I have ever seen. Taken right out of the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John this is a truly eye-opening visual for all of us who are familiar with the crucifixion according to the Bible. It allows you to use your visual sense to understand the pain and agony Jesus suffered for us hopefully impacting your walk with Him. Again, bravo Mel! I hope everyone gets the chance to see this movie.
B000060K4O|5.0|The movie is classic. Period. Nuff said. End of discussion. Bill Murray is a legend. Every man should have at least one Bill Murray DVD in his collection, and if you only have one, then Ghostbusters has to be it. Sure others will go on about Caddyshack and blah, blah, blah. Those people are idiots. Sure Cadyshack was great, but it is no Ghostbusters. Ghostbusters started a completely new genre: modern sci-fi comedy.<br />The DVD itself is great. Nice menus, engaging commentaries, etc., but the DVD still feels a little &quot;light&quot; on extras for such a classic movie. Hopefully it'll get the royal DVD treatment on it's 20th anniversary release.
B00013RC8O|5.0|This movie held me spellbound the first time I saw it and is still capable of this after countless viewings. This is more than just a car chase movie, it actually has depth and a story to tell. The scenery of the great American West is also first rate and the soundtrack never fails to set the mood.<br />The story of the main character, an auto delivery driver named Kowalski unfolds as he takes delivery of a white '70 Dodge Challenger which is as he puts it `souped up to 160' and proceeds to drive it from Denver to San Francisco. His plan, however is to do this in 15 hours to win a bet. As Kowalski makes his journey his life is revealed to us through flashbacks and recollections which are usually triggered by what is currently happening to him in real time. Through these the viewer learns that despite his apparent lawless behavior, Kowalski is a man of good character.<br />It is this good character, sense of duty and strong moral code that led to Kowalski's fallout with the establishment.  He had been a decorated war hero and was honorably discharged from the military.  A few years later, he was a decorated policeman.  However, when he saw his police partner behaving in an unsavory fashion, he reacted.  His reward was to be dishonorably discharged from the police force.  This ultimately led Kowalski down the path to where we are introduced to him.<br />One of the big things that drew me into this movie is that it doesn't hand you the explanations on a silver platter. Instead it allows you to think about it and draw your own conclusions long after you've seen it.  Some reviewers on IMDB have already done a great job of touching on the philosophies of freedom and individualism prevalent in this movie, so I won't waste the time trying to top those. I'll add that I feel this is a type of an expressionist film. Kowalski is kind of an `Everyman' who is on a journey to find his place in the grand scheme of things. Along his path he encounters various characters that watch over him and help him along, but there are also those who wish to shut him down. Whether you think the conclusion of Kowalski's journey is successful or not is up to you.<br />Another big plus is the realism in the driving scenes, where the drivers are actually driving their machines and occasionally things happen like tires going flat or the car needs fuel. Most modern car chase sequences leave me wanting with all of the computer generated car moves and general lack of realism. I know they sometimes got it wrong back then too, doing things like obviously speeding the film up. In this one though, they got it right. The driving here brings us into that realm of manhandling 4000 lbs. of American Iron, in all the glory of big-block V8 roar, screaming smoking tires, and hands grappling with the steering wheel.<br />Another thing that's cool to me about this type of movie is the appearance of the car. At the beginning, the car is resplendent in gleaming chrome and white paint. As the story moves along, the car gradually gets a more dusty battered countenance. I won't spoil the end, but those who've seen it know.<br />The final things that tie this whole thing together are the soundtrack and scenery. They seem to go hand in hand, from the upbeat rock &amp; roll as Kowalski starts out to the stirring guitar strains during the thoughtful moments. I also cannot say enough about the scenery, which really draws the viewer in. It ranges from the mountains of Colorado, across Utah and into the searing Nevada desert.<br />In closing, I'll say that this is one of my favorite movies. It won't be understood by everyone, but those of us who fantasize about getting in a classic car and blasting down an open two-lane highway devoid of SUV's, sport sedans and minivans will likely get it.
B000077VR3|1.0|I wish I could have given this no stars. Unquestionably one of the 10 worst movies ever made, although it doesn't even deserve to be called a movie. A lacerated video clip more like it. Nominated for a bunch of Oscars, together with A BEAUTIFUL MIND(another overrated dose of sugar), it proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that those awards are completely political &amp; utterly misguided. As many will agree, CHICAGO was everything this dismal effort so desperately yearned to be. A girlfriend of mine told me she cried when Satine(Nicole Kidman)died. I was incredulous. Who cared???? (I was overjoyed since it meant the ordeal was nearly over) With Richard Roxburgh apparently suffering from constipation coupled with Tourette's &amp; Jim Broadbent(usually brilliant)doing some sort of Quentin Crisp/Tootsie impersonation, I would equate this experience with a 3 day migraine. What in God's name were they smoking in the editing room?
B00018TI5E|5.0|This record is amazing. But then again when is Frusciantes work not amazing or at the least interesting. His lyrics are like poetry. The recording is amazing and his use of effects etc. are all put in at appropriate times and just make the album great. Good to listen the whole way through.
B00020X88O|4.0|I'll never forget the first time I saw this film. I saw it in a crowded theatre with a bunch of people who really got the joke. ALL ABOUT EVE crossed with VALLEY OF THE DOLLS, this flick is irresistible in terms of sheer trash. Kudos to Elizabeth Berkely for having the guts to get involved with a film such as this one. Like her or resent her, that girl is no fool. Since this, she has managed to work with both Oliver Stone & Woody Allen. Not exactly shabby company. Is she maybe a little like  her character Nomi? Kudos to Gina Gershon for delivering such a fantastically entertaining screen bitch(Not long after this she did some fantastic work with Michael Mann in THE INSIDER). A hilarious script with similar set design(check out Kyle Mclachlan's swimming pool)& choreography, SHOWGIRLS has to be seen to be believed. Has To Be Seen!!!!!!!!!!
B000286RZM|5.0|This record is great. It has so many good songs like &quot; an excersize&quot;, &quot; a loop&quot; and &quot;the will to death&quot;. Also John is releasing another 5 albums after this one basically one a month. Good news or what! The next cd will be a band that he made with a few friends call ATAXIA. Then he will release 4 more cds after that starting with DC EP.
6304056958|5.0|If you haven't seen &quot;The Women,&quot; do yourself a favor and see it any way you can - I checked out the video from my local library. I've never been a Norma Shearer fan, but she's good here...however, the movie belongs, in my humble opinion, to Paulette Goddard, Mary Boland, and, of course, Rosalind Russell. The catfight between Goddard and Russell is, by itself, worth the price of the video or DVD. So is Marjorie Main's brief part. Boland is hilarious. Goddard is delicious. Crawford is great in her part. Shearer, in keeping with the times, is a bit stilted in her role, but she plays it well, anyway. The dialogue is fast and kicky and great fun. The clothes are beautiful. They just don't make movies like this anymore!!!
B00005U8EM|5.0|G.D really is nearly perfect.  I never tire of it.  At the same time I think most people miss the point.  (By the way, I've NOT seen the Special Edition.)<br />I'm facinated each time watching the totally self centered Bill Murray caught in this marvelous time paradox, living the same day over and over.  He goes through differing stages: fear and confusion; euphoria, when he realizes he can do ANYTHING without consequence; despair, when he realizes that life is meaningless if one pursues selfish pleasures without goals; and finally a peaceful self actualization when he dedicates himself toward self improvement and the humanitarian goals his situation gives him the opportunity to pursue.<br />It gives one pause to consider what each of US would do in a similar circumstance.<br />Oh, it's really funny, too.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Last night I was hanging out at a friend's house and he played McCartney's album from 97, Flaming Pie. According to the liner notes, Paulie came off working on the Anthology project juiced up to write some new stuff. It showed. He hadn't sounded that good since the mid 70's.<BR>     I don't for a second understand the carping about Naked. Paul was a great melodist back in the day and the version of The Long and Winding Road excavated from Phil Spector's attentions is great piano balladry. Ray Charles note for note inspired great. The kind of stuff that neither Billy Joel or Elton John could possibly touch. But the great thing about this CD is the John Lennon material. The results are astounding. When you hear him on this album, you're reminded what he brought into this world. He's the best instinctive rock singer anyway you look at it. Cobain (whom I love) couldn't have made his mark without John's example.  I know people get hung up on genres, but one of the reasons John is so powerful as a rock singer is because he's so effortlessly inventive as a soul singer. Dig a Pony and Don't Let Me Down kick major ass and it's the vocals that hurt so good. Why is Lennon's superiority as a musician wielding a voice not recognized more? To bury this stuff beneath overproduction is a cardinal sin. Paul has great ears. Naked leaps to front  of the pack as the best post Revolver Beatles album.

0345440900|2.0|When I was pregnant and reading this book it all made perfect sense. She had great ideas; mostly common sense, yeah, but it was nice to see in this neat little package of a book. Then the baby came. Luckily I got this neat little &quot;textbook baby&quot;, for the first few months, anyway. I really liked the &quot;EASY&quot; routine. It worked for us for about four months. But we had an easy baby, too.<br />I was so angry - all the stories in her book had everything working out wonderfully. Then I went back and reread a little disclaimer at the beginning. &quot;The anecdotes included in this book are not necessarily based upon the experiences of individuals....&quot; Umm, so basically you made every situation turn out perfectly so you would look like this perfect parenting guru, huh? The Baby Whisperer is a total crock!<br />One last note, I found much of her information about breastfeeding to be not only misleading, but WRONG, so if you do plan on breastfeeding just skip over that bit.<br />Not worth purchasing, but maybe a quick perusal from the library before your baby arrives.<br />One positive note: her comments about not over-using a pacifier worked for us. Don't pop it back in if baby spits it out and is no longer fussing. Our baby gave it up on her own at nine months. But there, I've given you that bit of advice; you don't need the book!

B0001UL7RY|1.0|Avril Lavigne shows the true extent of her talent as a song writer and musician. She's clearly someone to watch, in the same way as an airplane crash, or a bloody car wreck, or a coyote mauling a kitten. Sadly the extent reaches out beyond its grasp. It grabs for the beer cozy next to it and falls down and shatters its hip. But if you already like Avril you'll probably like this album anyway, so there's no point. Buy a Radiohead album or Disintegration by the Cure if you have an inkling towards good music.
B00000JCB2|5.0|Even though Limp Bizkit's era of success is coming to a close and their Greatest Hits album is due out later this year, its undeniable that they did make a mark on music and that their a household name of today. I laugh at all the people who think their rebels when they wear \\"ANTI LIMP BIZKIT\\" shirts because in reality, LISTENING to LB is being more rebellious because its not trendy anymore. Fred Durst- love him or hate him was probably one of the best rock frontmen of all time, right up there with Axl Rose, Kurt Cobain, and Robert Plant. Controversial, brave, and just doesn't give a (...) perfect ingredients. This is a fun rap-rock album that doesn't hold back. This'll go down as a classic.
0375713751|5.0|I expected this to be a comical romp, instead I found a wonderful novel that made my heart ache with compassion and understanding. Of course, there were laugh-out-loud moments, but interwoven was a very true thing. Those reviewers who just didn't get it, have simply never known the joys and pains of motherhood and how they swirl about in a career world. Having worked full-time as an executive with baby #1, and then on to full-time mom for baby #2, I've seen both sides of the coin and Ms. Pearce nails it, perhaps at times in a caricature kind of way, but nonetheless heartbreakingly with truth. This is a book I will recommend to other moms, but would not recommend to a man...because I just don't know how he would get it.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|One of the Greatest action/adventure films of the 20th century. The epic swashbuckling adventure of one of history's greatest heroes.the dashing Errol Flynn as Robin Hood or as they also call him &quot;Sir Robin of Locksley&quot; was perfect. He was what a swashbuckler should be and probably the greatest of all swashbucklers. Basil Rathbone and Claude Rains were brilliant as Robin's foes, Sir Guy and Prince John. Oliva DeHavilland was glamorous as the love of Robin Hood, Maid Marian. My Favorite scene was Robin and Sir Guy's sword fight during King Richard's return. Flynn and Rathbone two of cinema's sword fighting experts. I love the sound of sword clangling. If your looking for a classic film or a swashbuckler film, this is a great one. Because this a film that created Pirates of the Carribean, &quot;Long Live King Richard.&quot;
B0000DD7LB|1.0|What do I say about this album that has not been said already? To be fair, I have not heard this entire album. However, I have heard three tracks off of it and I am not impressed in the least, and my dislike is not motivated by jealousy but rather lack of talent on Britney Spears' part. (I know I can't sing, but I'm also not touring the world and making millions for being ear-splitting but overly risque either.) And if Miss Spears wants one last gasp at reviving her dying career, she should read this review.<br />For one, if she wants to attract a more \\"adult\\" fanbase,she might try actually writing some lyrics and keeping her clothes on because her so-called \\"grown-up\\" act leaves much to be desired. Dancing around half-naked and \\"singing\\" constantly about how sexual she is doesn't show how adult she is,it just makes her look and sound like a 15 year old virgin who likes to pretend that they are more sexually experienced than they really are.<br />Secondly, she needs to take some voice lessons. I say this because as a music journalism major, I notice some major flaws in her voice, such as inability to hit high notes decently, bad vocal technique, and her constanr need to use a whispery \\"baby\\" voice. And anyone who says otherwise is either extremely deluded or has no concept of a true rock/pop vocalist because Miss Britney is not one of them.<br />When I think of the term \\"female rock/pop vocalist\\", people like Doro Pesch, Angela Gossow and Pat Benatar some to mind, not Britney Spears, who couid only hope to have even an ounce of any of these women's talent. You see, these women don't have to take off their clothes, kiss Madonna or wear underclothes onstage to get people to hear them, because they have something Britney Spears does not: talent.<br />Think about it for a moment after watching a video by Arch Enemy, Warlock,or Pat Benatar. Are any of these frontwomen dancing with snakes? Pulling their clothes off? Simulating sex with dancers? No, they are not and that'sbecause they don't need to. Their talent speaks louder and is sexier than Britney Spears' faux sex appeal. <br />This being said, anyone who buys this album will probably either be some dirty old man or a TRL addict who won't give a rodent's rectum what I say,so buy this album at your own risk, but be warned that it is the same reheated trash this fantastically untalented person puts out year after year, just smuttier than the last stupefyingly unlistenable effort. <br />Hopefully she goes away soon and takes her other unlistenable half-dressed blonde bimbo cronies Jessica Simpson,Christina Aguilera, and Hilary Duff with her. Stick a fork in her,she's done. <br />Anyway, instead of buying this waste, I recommend good (male and female) bands who actually play their own instruments and write their own songs, such as HammerFall, Powerman 5000,Arch Enemy and The Donnas. And for those of you who don't like metal/hard/alternative rock, try Michelle Branch, Joss Stone, Toby Lightman, Norah Jones and Vanessa Carlton. Anything but this, please.

B0001IN0DA|5.0|WrestleMania XX<br />US Title <BR>John Cena V Big Show<BR>At first Big Show dominates a lot. Near the end it gets good though, with 2 FUs and Cena using brass knucks. The crowd were into it, and overall it was a nice opener to the show. 7/10<br />World Tag Titles <BR>Booker and RVD V Dudleys V La Resistance V Jindrak & Cade<BR>The rules of the match a pretty stupid really, it would have been better with just 2 teams. However it gets pretty good towards the end, with RVD hitting the 5-star frog splash. 6/10 <br />Christian V Chris Jericho<BR>To be honest I wasn't really expecting it, but I really liked this match. They did some great moves and the pace was great. It never got boring and was enjoyable all the way through. Also there's a great twist at the end. 9/10<br />Evolution (Flair/Orton/Batista) V Rock & Sock Connection<BR>It's a shame that Foley and Orton didn't have their hardcore match at this event rather than Backlash the next month. However this was a good match, with some good moments. Flair and Rock worked really well together. Also Rock's promo before the match is pretty cool. 7/10<br />Playboy Evening Gown Match<BR>Sable & Torrie V Stacey & Jackie <BR>This match was very bad, and wasted time in which some good wrestlers (like Matt Hardy) could have had a match. CRAP! 1/10<br />Cruiserweight Title Open<BR>Chavo V Noble V Funaki V Ultimo V Rey V Nunzio V Tajiri V Shannon V Kidman <BR>This could have been longer, but there were still some good moves, as you'd expect from the cruiserweights. Kidman and Rey were both great The best part was Kidman's shooting star press to the outside of the ring. The match format was interesting too, with 2 men in at a time. Also, look out for Funaki, who lasts just 3 seconds! 8/10<br />Goldberg V Brock Lesnar<BR>Special referee = Stone Cold Steve Austin <BR>This match had loads of buildup and could have been awesome. However it was a massive disappointment. Both Brock and Goldberg were leaving after this match, and the crowd knew it. The match was very bad too, with barely any moves, except a few specials. The staredown at the start was stupidly long too and very boring. Disappointment of the night by far! At least Austin stunners both Brock and Goldberg after though. 3/10<br />WWE Tag Titles <BR>Scotty & Rikishi V APA V Bashams V TWGTT<BR>Another fatal four-way? Again, it would have been better with just 2 teams, although there was buildup between these 4. The ending was a bit sudden, but overall this was a decent match. It seemed even better after the Brock/Goldberg crap. 6/10 <br />Women's Title<BR>Victoria V Molly<BR>This could have been a little bit longer actually, as it could have been one of the better women's matches. Then again maybe being short saved it. A roll-up ending by Victoria meant Molly got her head shaved, which was pretty funny and gets the match an extra star. 5/10<br />WWE Title <BR>Eddie Guerrero V Kurt Angle<BR>A very good technical match, I liked it a lot. It was just as good as the Jericho/Christian match. They do lots of cool technical moves, and there are some cool near finishes. In the end Eddie unties his boot, and kicks it off when Kurt goes for an ankle lock and then get the roll-up for the win. A unique and cool ending! 9/10<br />Undertaker V Kane<BR>Undertaker's return was very cool, with the whole arena going dark, and then Paul Bearer coming out. Finally Taker came out. It's a shame his attire isn't that different though, he just comes to the ring with a hat and coat thing. Kane's entrance was also pretty cool. As for the match though, it was too short. Taker goes for old school but Kane reverses and chokeslams Taker. Taker sits up and then does his chokeslam followed by Tombstone for the 1 2 3. It was a good match but far too short. I'll give it an extra star for the return of the Dead-Man style Undertaker and the entrances. 7/10 <br />World Heavyweight Title <BR>Chris Benoit V Triple H V Shawn Michaels<BR>This was an amazing triple threat match.I was surprised they didn't use any weapons, but Shawn gets busted open and bleeds loads. Triple H also bleeds quite a lot, and there's a great spot where HHH and HBK double suplex Benoit from the Spanish announce table through the Smackdown announce table. There some really close near falls, good submissions and loads of brilliant moves. It was great at the end as Shawn is thrown out of the ring and Benoit makes The Game tap out to the crippler crossface. Finally Benoit won the title (he should have done about 3 or 4 years ago, but that made this even more special). Then Eddie comes out to congratulate him. 2 friends who entered the WWE together had climbed to the top of the mountain, as Eddie had won his WWE first title a month earlier at No Way Out and then successfully defended against Kurt earlier in the night. There couldn't have been a more perfect ending to WrestleMania XX as Eddie and Benoit hug each other and celebrate their wins. 10/10<br />Overall<BR>The event was way too over hyped. This wasn't the best PPV ever, it actually wasn't the best WrestleMania ever either. WrestleMania X-Seven is still the best WM and PPV ever. However this was still a great event and well worth buying. The top 3 matches are World Title, WWE Title and Jericho/Christian. Also there are loads of extras on the DVD.
B00004SVID|4.0|While I don't rate this CD as high as 'The Wall' itself, it is always a treat to hear great studio productions taken on the road successfully.  Having seen &quot;Pink Floyd&quot; (minus Mr. Waters), David Gilmour Solo (about face) and Roger Waters in concert, I must admit I always go away feeling like a little of me was empty.  With this CD you get the full treatment.  Gilmours tasty guitar sound coupled with Waters biting snarl.  Gets four out of five because I wasn't there and I am jealous of whoever was!!!  Buy it and enjoy!!!
B0001DI0FI|5.0|Master and Commander has managed to capture the essence of the Jack Aubrey series in an unbelievably realistic and entertaining movie.<br />The film starts out with the HMS Surprise, a small 26 gun frigate, sailing off the cost of Brazil, searching for a French Privateer heading for the Pacific to attack English Trade. It captures in the opening moments the crowding, tension, and lifestyle of the crew. When the French Ship begins to fire at the Surprise the viewer immediately knows the movie sets a new standard for realism in a sea adventure. Cannon balls wiz into the ship, realistically scattering clouds of splinters, and doing serious damage.<br />The movie follows the attempts of the officers and crew to repair the ship, and strike back at it's tormentor.<BR>Anyone brought up as I was on Horatio Hornblower is going to take great pleasure in this film. While the screenplay has basically combined two of the Jack Aubrey books, and extracted events from others, the whole makes for a smoothly running complete story (which some of the books are not!)<br />The cinematography and special effects are very well done, and you gain a real feeling for many of the characters. It has plenty of swashbuckling battle scenes, but also brings a very human touch to Aubrey, Maturin, and the young midshipmen that may not have been possible if they tried to accent all of the personal interactions present in the book. Given the time constraints of a film I don't see how they could have emphasized Maturins' intelligence activities and still captured the depth of his naturalist feelings.<br />There is a lot of violence, and graphic medical sequences in the film, so it's not for the extremely squeamish, but it all fit within the plot and the decision to be as realistic as modern cinematography could make it, so it did not seem gratuitous at all.<br />This is a fine film, and a must see for anyone interested in Napoleonic Navel History!
B00005MM67|5.0|The climbing sequences, especially the one where all of them are having a break while hanging underneath a clift are enough to make you feel vertigo, and one thing that really makes the film feel authentic is in the cold weather, you can see their breath, so you know it WAS cold when they filmed it. This movie is worth seeing also for another thing - Raymond J. Barry. What a stud! When climbing the mountain you see him in skin-tight jeans, and the size of his thighs and glutes are amazing for a 50 year old man. The cameraman must have recognized this because you see Mr. Barry's glutes and hamstrings in almost every scene. What a body! He shames men half his age. Still, it is a little unbelievable for his character to have the body of a bodybuilder, but who cares? Oh, Michael Biehn is pretty good too. But as good as the film is, I still have no desire to ever climb a mountain!
0156027321|5.0|This is an excellent book, beautifully written and full of surprises.  The last chapter caused me to flip back through different sections and reconsider what I'd read.  I thought about the different twists and turns for days.  The book captured my imagination and filled with with visual wonder. A true masterpiece!
0808514121|5.0|This one's dark folks.  I have to say I didn't expect Steinbeck's \\"East of Eden,\\" to catch me the way it did.  The themes Steinbeck struggles with are epic--the relationship of men within the family, good and evil, human nature.  Critics derided the novel when it came out and it may have left Steinbeck struggling to write in his waning years, but the Nobel prize he received shortly after \\"East of Eden's\\" release was truly deserving.  Truly deserving because of the work of \\"East of Eden,\\" and not despite it.<br />I read the wonderful and incomparable biography \\"John Steinbeck, Writer,\\" by Jackson J. Benson before tackling \\"East of Eden,\\" and it tainted my expectations.  Some criticisms of the novel I found initially true.  Steinbeck seems to be more straightforward and writes more of what's on his mind instead of letting the story and characters breathe these things naturally.  At some point in the novel that approach strikes me as breaking the novelist dictum of, \\"show don't tell.\\"  Steinbeck does a lot of telling.  Surprisingly enough, in the end, this slight misstep strengthens the overall story.  It puts you in the mind of Steinbeck and allows the reader to gain a deeper understanding of the dark dark nature of some of \\"East of Eden's\\" characters.<br />Steinbeck always tended to have a dark side, but \\"East of Eden,\\" is a stark look at the underbelly of humanity.  However, while we are looking at the underbelly of a seemingly upright community of Salinas, we also see that humanity is redeeming.  Some of the very incomprehensible evil within a person is matching by a boundless capacity for good.  How can that be?  This is why Steinbeck's \\"East of Eden,\\" surpasses the better known and wider read, \\"The Grapes of Wrath.\\"  Steinbeck seems to accept human nature and not sugar coat.  He tells it like it is.<br />Steinbeck struggled and struggled to write and finish \\"East of Eden.\\"  The scope of what he was trying to attempt was extremely daunting...almost debilitatingly so.  Steinbeck tried to retell the story of \\"Genesis,\\" set in his hometown of Salinas...drawing from his own life, the town's life, the times between the Civil War and World War I.  He pulls it off with quite some characters...Adam Trask and his twin sons Caleb and Aron, their mother--the completely evil Cathy/Cat/Kate, Adam's evenly evil and good brother Charles, the sage Chinese Lee, and the beautiful of mind, body, and spirit love interest of no less than Caleb, Aron, and Lee...Abra.  I think to call, \\"East of Eden,\\" lacking in story and characters is severely missing the mark.  Another criticism of the book is that the Chinese character of Lee is a racial stereotype.  I didn't find this to be the case.  Lee seems to be a multi-dimensional character that if anything deepens the understanding that his ethnicity takes a back seat to his humanity.  Another criticism is that the character Kate is too evil...to the point of dehumanization.  Steinbeck's portrayal of Kate may have roots in his failed relationships but it does not come across as misogynistic.  He balances this out with other female characters, such as Abra, that have capacity for the gamut of human characteristics.  Kate's portrayal of evil makes the character more real...more frightening...and indicative of human evil that, regardless of philosophy, tends to surface from time to time.<br />In my mind, Steinbeck's \\"Cannery Row,\\" still stands out as his best (at least among his works I've read so far), but \\"East of Eden,\\" solidifies his place among a very short list of greatest American authors.  It is a work deserving of a Nobel Prize for literature...damn the critics to say what they will.<br />--MMWso.  Steinbeck tried to retell the story of \\"Genesis,\\" set in his hometown of Salinas...drawing from his own life, the town's life, the times between the Civil War and World War I.  He pulls it off with quite some characters...Adam Trask and his twin sons Caleb and Aron, their mother--the completely evil Cathy/Cat/Kate, Adam's evenly evil and good brother Charles, the sage Chinese Lee, and the beautiful of mind, body, and spirit love interest of no less than Caleb, Aron, and Lee...Abra.  I think to call, \\"East of Eden,\\" lacking in story and characters is severely missing the mark.  Another criticism of the book is that the Chinese character of Lee is a racial stereotype.  I didn't find this to be the case.  Lee seems to be a multi-dimensional character that if anything deepens the understanding that his ethnicity takes a back seat to his humanity.  Another criticism is that the character Kate is too evil...to the point of dehumanization.  Steinbeck's portrayal of Kate may have roots in his failed relationships but it does not come across as misogynistic.  He balances this out with other female characters, such as Abra, that have capacity for the gamut of human characteristics.  Kate's portrayal of evil makes the character more real...more frightening...and indicative of human evil that, regardless of philosophy, tends to surface from time to time.<br />In my mind, Steinbeck's \\"Cannery Row,\\" still stands out as his best (at least among his works I've read so far), but \\"East of Eden,\\" solidifies his place among a very short list of greatest American authors.

B0001Z52RU|3.0|I was intrigued by the trailers for this movie when it came out, but I never got around to seeing it. Part of the reason was the Kutcher factor (Can he carry it off?), but mostly I was distracted by more important things. When it came out on DVD, I was excited to see it. And the video store clerk told me it was GREAT.<br />It wasn't great.<br />First things first: Ashton Kutcher does a good job in the movie. In fact, all of the actors turn in good performances, especially considering that they are required to play the same character in alternate realities. Despite the changed circumstances, the characters remain consistent, and that's more difficult than it sounds. The young actors who play the main characters as children are very good, particularly Logan Lerman, who plays Evan (the Kutcher character) at age 7. Lerman is required to play a broader emotional range than Kutcher, especially when you consider that in his later scenes, he has to \\"channel\\" the adult Evan as well. Another bright spot, in a role that could have been phoned in, is Nathaniel DeVeaux, who plays Evan's doctor.<br />My problem with the film is not in the acting, but in the writing. Although the ideas are interesting - and if you're reading this review, I assume you already know the basic plot of the movie - the execution is fairly flat. An earlier reviewer compared this movie to \\"It's a Wonderful Life,\\" and like that movie, the first half seems endless. The scenes setting up Evan's childhood traumas seem to go on forever - especially since we don't get to see what actually happened/happens until later in the film. There's a good reason for this, given the structure of the film, but it makes the first hour of the movie feel like homework.<br />In the trailer, a voice over informs Evan, \\"Think of it like a movie. You can pause, rewind, or slow down.\\" In the film, unfortunately, that line occurs in a scene in which a younger Evan is hypnotized. When the adult Evan begins time-traveling, his trips are all pretty straight forward. And when he returns to the present, we get the gag pretty quickly, and nothing in the writing deepens those moments. The characters aren't human beings so much as pieces in a puzzle the writers/directors are building, so it's hard to care what happens.<br />I did enjoy the twists of the plot. I won't go into details, for those who haven't seen the movie, but the cause of Evan's childhood blackouts, when eventually revealed, is enjoyable, and the ways the writers limit Evan's travel possibilities as time goes on adds to the suspense. I must side with those who find the directors' ending far superior, and much more in line with the tone of the movie, than the ending of the theatrical release.<br />Is the movie worth watching? If you're patient and you're not expecting much - or, even more, if your state of mind is altered - it's worth a rental. But if you've seen Homer Simpson travel through time using a toaster, you've seen most of what this film has to offer.
0393317552|5.0|If you have curiosity about how the big picture of civilizations emerged - for example, why it was the European civilizations dominating with ships and guns and not the American civilizations - you should really enjoy this book. Yes, Jared Diamond has biases (he clearly doesn't like people who believe whites are genetically superior to other races) but he weaves a fantastic story with scientific facts and elegant reasoning. Many facts (relating to plant and animal science) are clearly and concisely presented. Other facts are obvious once pointed out (the lack of domesticatable animals in sub-Saharan Africa, or how long it takes for domesticated plants to adjust to different climates) you have these great &quot;Aha&quot; moments while reading. I loved how his arguments came together.  <br />Are there cons? Well, certain chapters in the second half of the book do repeat parts of the first half. It adds to the clarity (showing how the same principles can apply to different parts of the world), but if you &quot;got it&quot; the first time, some parts of the book can get long. Given how this book can change the way you look at different peoples and cultures, I can forgive him for repeating himself.<br />If you like science and are curious about how environment shaped, or better, limited civilizations, get this book.
B00003CXCT|5.0|This is a must have (and an awesome gift).  Think about it...finally you can watch Tatooine, the X-wing fighters, the AT&Ts and snowspeeders battling it out in Hoth, the Ewok battle, etc. in crisp DVD quality on your big screen TV.  The fourth disc supposedly has commentary from Harrison Ford and the other major parts of the Star Wars series....how long have we waited for that too?  Kids who are new to the series will be able to appreciate and see it like it was a brand new trilogy.
0452282152|4.0|I did like the writing style used. It was clear, simple and it seemed to me as if it was really clean, if that makes any sense. It was an easy, almost straight to the point story that kept me entertained. I think there were some deep metaphors that passed me by though. I liked most of the characters but would have liked it better if they were given some more depth.    However, I can see how some people would not like this book. Not alot really happens and I imagin (though I haven't seen it) that the film version is rather slow and boring. As I read it in a day I dont think I had time to get bored with it. The characters are not particluary memerable and some seem very flat at times. It's supposed to be a book about passion but I didn't feel much between any of the characters. Although Griet may have felt it for her master, until he left her the earrings at the end I don't think I felt anything at all from him though out the whole book, and as a result I didn't care about this character. I don't know anything about the real Vermeer so I have no idea if he acted anything like he did in the story.     Despite it's faults I did really enjoy this book and as long as your someone who can relex and read something that's not packed full of action I think you'll probably enjoy it too.
B00005JMSE|5.0|I went and saw hellboy with my boy firend and a few other friends and I LOVED IT. I though it was one of the best movies I've seen all year. The animation was awesome and I liked the humor that was thrown in. All in all, I would totally reccomend this movie to people who like action movies.
0156027321|5.0|This book will make you think.  Certainly you will think about the psychology of disaster survival, and you will think about the human inventions of mythology and religion employed throughout the history of mankind in coping with life's tragedies or celebrating life's triumphs.  But if this makes it sound like some sterile study in human psychology or cultural anthropology, I assure you my words are entirely inadequate to describe the feeling of awe this book will leave you with.  It will touch you in places deep within you that you had forgotten or were unaware even existed.  This book is truly a work of art.  Read it and weep.
B00005JMYG|1.0|I won't go into much detail about this movie.  It's boring and stupid and rarely draws a laugh.  But even the idle laughter ended when Jack Black punted Will Ferrell's dog off a bridge.  Yeah, hilarious stuff.  Animal cruelty is always a real knee slapper.  Bet people will be lining up to see that.<br />I guess that the dog comes back alive in the end is supposed to redeem it, but kicking a dog off a bridge is never going to be funny.  I hope every animal lover even tempted to see this movie avoids this movie like the plague.<br />The scene was very shocking and I guess that's how it was supposed to derive the laugh, but a few weeks ago People magazine ran an article about some kid who kicked his neighbor's dog like a football and is facing deserved criminal charges for animal cruelty.  So I'm sure another idiot kid somewhere will see this movie and go out imitating it for a joke.  Ha, ha.  Nice going guys.<br />Minus that scene, this movie is still terrible.  Save your money.

B0001US62I|5.0|This is definitely one of the creepiest movies you'll ever see and the ending is a shocker.  Set in 1955, a private detective named Harry Angel (played my Mickey Rourke) is hired by Louis Cyphre to find a long ago crooner named Johnny Favorite, who owes him something.  The search leads Angel to a dark underworld of voodoo and strange murders.  In his search for Favorite, Harry goes to New Orleans, where he runs into Epiphany Proudfoot, played by Lisa Bonet.  As Harry gets closer to the truth of Favorite's whereabouts, things just get weirder and weirder.  And Louis Cyphre turns out to be Harry's worst nightmare.  And the title is an excellent play on the movie's denoument.  Overall this is a great creepy thriller.  <br />The DVD extras are also interesting (see the Mickey Rourke interview, is tragi-comic).
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'd never heard of this series before, but stumbled upon it while browsing DVDs here at Amazon and bought it because of all the rave reviews.<br />I just finished the first episode, and have to say it's as good as everyone says. Good special effects, an interesting universe, and most importantly interesting characters and relationships.
078322608X|5.0|Despite the cheesy special effects and some unnecessarily silly scenes that greatly detract from the movie, 12 Monkeys is a very good science fiction movie.<br />Set in the year 2035, a plague has wiped out much of the human race and they are forced to live deep underground.  Scientists of the era send criminals back in time, using imperfect time machine technology, to try to discover the origins of the virus so they can bring a sample back to the future to find a cure, and take back the planet.  Bruce Willis plays Cole, who is sent back to find out who the 12 Monkeys are, which are believed to be a terrorist group responsible for the unleashing the virus.  Unfortunately, he sent back to wrong time and finds himself in a mental institution.  While there he is treated by a psychiatrist played by Madeline Stowe and runs into Brad Pitt - a wacky mental patient.  It's hard to tell much more about the plot without giving the movie away, but these two characters play a vital role in the plot.<br />The director does an excellent job with the time travel elements of the story, an aspect that become quickly inconsistent and ruinous to a movie of this nature without careful attention to detail.  The acting is also superb.  I would highly recommend the movie.<br />Also note, the \\"Making Of\\" feature on the DVD is one of the few that I actually enjoyed and found quite interesting.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|When vocalist Corey Taylor (a.k.a. #8) and guitarist Jim Root (a.k.a. #4) took off their homemade masks and got back together with their former band &quot;Stone Sour&quot; in 2002, many Slipknot fans (known affectionately as &quot;Maggots&quot;) feared that their favorite nine-member, mask-wearing, nihilistic heavy/rap metal band was on the verge of breaking up.  Fear not Maggots, Corey Taylor and Jim Root never discarded their masks.  They rejoined their other seven Slipknot band mates in 2003 to record what is arguably their best album to date.  Released in May, 2004, Slipknot's third album, entitled &quot;Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses)&quot;, demonstrates a far more mature and dynamic sound than their two previous albums to date.  It also demonstrates the influence that working again with &quot;Stone Sour&quot; had upon Corey Taylor and Jim Root.  My ratings for each of the 14 tracks on the album follow:<br />1. &quot;Prelude 3.0&quot; (5). A collection of dark &amp; mysterious chords and light percussion accompany Corey Taylor's emotional vocals start this album at a slower tempo before giving way quickly to the next track.<br />2. &quot;The Blister Exists&quot; (5). Fast &amp; furious, this hard-hitting track begins with aggressive guitar, double drumming and Corey Taylor's often-screaming vocals in a mix very typical of past Slipknot songs.<br />3. &quot;Three Nil&quot; (5).  Another song very typical of past Slipknot works with fast, aggressive &amp; loud guitar, strong percussion and Corey Taylor's combination of screaming, spoken and melodic vocals with a mix of unusual chords and effects.<br />4. &quot;Duality&quot; (5+).  A soft beginning focusing on Corey Taylor's vocals quickly builds into what is arguably the best song on the album.  A great mix of Corey's screaming, spoken &amp; melodic vocals accompanied by aggressive/melodic guitar and strong percussion.<br />5. &quot;Opium of the People&quot; (4.5). A song that blends speed metal with Corey's typical Slipknot style that switches to more melodic choruses.<br />6. &quot;Circle&quot; (5). The influence of the Corey Taylor's &amp; Jim Root's involvement with &quot;Stone Sour&quot; is demonstrated in this atypical very melodic ballad that includes orchestral string instruments.<br />7. &quot;Welcome&quot; (4.5). A song very reminiscent of speed and thrash metal, but in a much more modern translation.<br />8. &quot;Vermilion&quot; (4.5).  Aptly named for the scarlet-red color, they lyrics of this melodic/aggressive combination of fast guitar and strong percussion focuses on a relationship with a woman.<br />9. &quot;Pulse of the Maggots&quot; (5).  This tribute to Slipknot's fans is a great mix of Corey's screaming, spoken &amp; melodic vocals accompanied by fast, aggressive guitar (lots of riffs) and intense double-drumming percussion.<br />10. &quot;Before I Forget&quot; (5). An explosive mix of aggressive guitar, bass and intense percussion blended with Corey's melodic/screaming vocals.<br />11. &quot;Vermilion Pt. 2&quot; (5).  Another atypical, very melodic &amp; acoustic ballad that highlights Corey Taylor's amazing voice whose lyrics focus on a relationship with a woman.  Again, another influence from Corey &amp; Jim Root's recent involvement with &quot;Stone Sour&quot;.<br />12. &quot;The Nameless&quot; (4.5). Fast &amp; furious percussion, guitar and bass begin this song with Corey's screaming vocals that occasionally &amp; unexpectedly transforms into a very melodic ballad.<br />13. &quot;The Virus of Life&quot; (4.5). An eclectic mix of percussion, percussion effects, bass and Corey's spoken vocals.<br />14. &quot;Danger - Keep Away&quot; (4).  An unusual, low-pitched ballad featuring sometimes-oddly timed chords backed with soft percussion and Corey's very melodic vocals that abruptly ends the album.<br />My overall rating for Slipknot's &quot;Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Versus)&quot; is 5 out of 5 stars.  The other members of Slipknot include DJ Sid Wilson (#0), drummer Joey Jordison (#1), bassist Paul Grey (#2), percussionist Chris Fehn (#3), sampler/programmer Craig Jones (#5), percussionist Shawn &quot;Clown&quot; Crahan (#6) and guitarist Mick Thompson (#7).ordison (#1), bassist Paul Grey (#2), percussionist Chris Fehn (#3), sampler/programmer Craig Jones (#5), percussionist Shawn &quot;Clown&quot; Crahan (#6) and guitarist Mick Thompson (#7).
B00020HEL6|5.0|I am a huge fan of voices and Renee is right at the top of the elite with this album.  She has not only the crystal clear smoothness in her voice, but her vocals displayed all the nuance and feeling of a singer three times her age.  I heard the album without knowing that it was the little girl from Still Standing (TV sitcom) and was floored to find out the range of this girl's talent.  In short, Renee is a stunning singer.  I already can't wait to hear more from her.
B000001YOW|4.0|This album, along with Stupid Dream, was among the first works  I heard of Porcupine Tree.  This was also the first time in which Steven Wilson worked with a full band for an entire album.<br />Experimental, eerie, psychedelic, it's like they took all of the progressive rock influences, put them in a blender, added a little ambient sounds and electronica, and let it rip.  This album represents a mix of what Steven Wilson had been doing as basically a one-man band, and what they will eventually become.<br />Sleep of No Dreaming, and Sever are some of the darker, harder tracks, and gives you a harbinger of things to come with the direction Porcupine Tree would eventually take.  This album is also full of atmospheric, ambient instrumental tracks like Idiot Prayer, Intermediate Jesus, and Light Mass Prayers.  Darkmatter, the final track, is one of my all-time favorite Porcupine Tree songs.  Signify is definitely an album worth listening to.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This movie is not one for the kids. It's passionate and very easily misinterpreted. This is a thinking movie about a boy who has to make a very hard choice between dying or seeing his loved ones die. It's excellent all the way through and is highly suggested to anyone interested in seeing the darkness of human existence.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|It's my brother who bought Avril's CD and when he did it I really thought I won't like it. Now I realize that I was wrong.<BR>I've been very very surprised the first time I listened the disc. <BR>First off I'd like to say that all the disc sounds as lots of bands I've already bought. But it's not a trouble 'cos in a way Avril came off to find her own style. I like a lot the way she sings. Even if some melodies seem a bit familiar, I really enjoy this CD. My favourite song is Who Knows I love the very begining of this song. The sixth is awesome too I like the chorus. Actually, apart from the eighth and the tenth I like all songs. Avril's got such a beautiful voice.<BR>Just to recap I would say that the disc isn't quite original but exciting a lot. If you like beautiful melodies and powerful electric guitars, you'll enjoy ze CD.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|ANIMAL HOUSE is one of the funniest, most subversive comedies ever made! It takes the college system apart, turning it into a playground for the outcasts on campus. Dean Wormer (John Vernon) has had just about enough of these delinquents. Delta Tau Chi is the worst frat in Faber College history, infamous for it's debauchery and total lack of respect for the traditions of the fraternity system. Delta house is more funhouse than fraternity house. It's members are a band of sex-obsessed alcoholics (hmmm, actually sounds pretty normal to me) with a knack for causing mayhem. Peter Riegert is \\"Boon\\" and Karen Allen is his girlfriend, Katy, who is just about fed up with the whole immature mess. Tim Matheson is \\"Otter\\", the Don Juan-type, set only on finding and fulfilling every woman's fantasy.... well, something like that. John Belushi is brilliant as \\"Bluto\\" Blutarski, a drunken lunatic with a heart of gold. His near silent performance steals every scene in a Chaplin / Keaton-esque way. This movie is the best thing the NATIONAL LAMPOON (the most irreverent, politically incorrect, spot-on hilarious humor magazine ever conceived) ever did. Written by Chris Miller, ANIMAL HOUSE is VERY loosely based on his own experiences at Dartmouth. He even has a small part as \\"HARDBAR\\". Doug Kenney (A national lampoon founding father) is \\"STORK\\", the guy who leads the Faber marching band astray in the legendary parade scene. If you like toga parties (aka: orgies), road trips, food fights, and anything else it takes to get through an otherwise dull existence, then ANIMAL HOUSE is for you! This movie was the first of it's kind, unfortunately giving birth to a stream of immitators and lesser phlegms.. er, films, like Porky's, Revenge Of The Nerds, etc. None have come remotely close to this masterpiece of hijinx gone terribly wrong! Highly recommended...
0802130208|3.0|Maybe it was the fact that I have read so many positive reviews about this book throughout the years or the Pulitzer prize that this book won that made me want to read \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\".  I had high hopes for the book but soon found out that I was duped.  I realize this book is meant to be a satire but the characters are so over the top that it is impossible to like any of the characters.  When I started reading this book the opening passages described Ignatius as someone that was a little slower than the rest of us.  He had no endearing qualities because he is at once complaining about his valve and at the same time eating like a pig.<br />  The story arc isn't complete either.  I finished this book with a completely unsatisfied and empty feeling.  You somewhat know where Ignatius ends up but there is a character introduced in the middle of the book (Dr. Talc) that serves no real purpose other than to take up space.  He is introduced and there is some backstory about Ignatius and Myrna but then Dr. Talc is slowly written out of the story with no real ending for the character and no story arc written for him.  It felt as if 40 pages or so were just wasted when some backstory could have been explained in just a few pages without introducing a character that is superfluous.<br />  I would like to continue writing about how this book could have been better but I would rather just read a book that is more well written that doesn't feel like it needs to use a vocabulary that most of society doesn't use.  If I had written that book I don't know if I would want to write any more books after this one for the thought of being \\"lashed about the shoulders\\" as Ignatius likes to write about some of his acquaintances.<br />  I am giving this book three stars because there was potential but it is far from being humorous.

0679428895|2.0|I cannot say I liked this book.  It had its moments, but they were few and far between.  Basically the plot is about an Aquarius(A guy who manges the aqueducts of Rome) and a Volcano with a little romance mixed in.  Very boring indeed.<br />Premise:  The entire story is about the aquarius and his quest to go to Pompeii to fix the aqueduct.  Along the way he makes enemies, you don't really know why.  He meets a girl, who he likes, but she comes and goes in passing.  You meet one really bad guy, but he doesn't come across as really that bad.  The main character instead comes off as a panzy woose.<br />There is poor writing and very poor characterization.  Each character is briefly described if at all.  The ending comes off very fast, and not properly dealt with.  In the last 1/8 of the book the mountain explodes, a round about rescue is performed, the bad guys dies and the girl rescued, the end.<br />Avoid this book if possible.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|this is one of my top five albums of all time. the effect it gives just to listen to 'room on fire' from the start to end is one of the most powerful musical experiences i can imagine. this album was everything i had hoped for; it's difficult to express how emotionally charged this album is. i can remember how it felt when i had first put on the cd and 'whatever happened?' came on. i was trying to do work but i had to stop doing everything just so i could fully allow myself to be encompassed in the feel of it all.  i think of it as a must have and i don't understand how someone could not be completely taken with it.
0618526412|5.0|If your taste is in espionage novels, this one's not for you. I suppose McCuller's intention was not to excite (by providing thrills or chills), but to provide a meaningful context for characters who find meaningless and absurdity in life. It's a psychological novel. If you find the narrative depressing, I suggest rather than hide behind such feelings by avoiding the unknown (as the characters in the novel seem to do), you should objectify your subjectivity and read up on some existential philosophy--the inspiration for this kind of literature.
B0002858YS|4.0|To the list of bands in the last few years that sound blatantly retro and are quite good at it (the Strokes, Interpol, the Darkness, Franz Ferdinand, etc), add the Killers to the list... <br />Hot Fuss is a fantastic debut cd that updates 80s music and toughens it up for modern times.  The first single, Somebody told Me, reminds me a lot (at least lyrically if nothing else) of the catchiness of Blur's Boys and Girls.  In a lot of ways this band is like a more-fun version of the Stills (who I also love), even though lyrically the music can often be quite dark. <br />There are a ton of stand-out tracks here, beginning with the first one, which is one of the best.  My other favorites are two, three, four, and seven, although honestly even the worst tracks here are worth listening to.<br />One interesting note... a lot of people I have played this for assume that this band is British.  Not so... with the Darkness and Franz Ferdinand stealing some thunder from the Strokes and the Stripes, score this as a win in USA's column.<br />A debut album thats catchy, lyrically meaningful, musically dense, and non-cheesily retro (even with synths involved)... what can I say, except that I can't wait for the follow-up album.
1401300901|2.0|When I heard about this book, I thought it was a really interesting premise. Chick lit as a genre suffers from a lack of originality (the formulaic three-women's-lives-intertwine-as-they-overcome-various-crises plot, anyone?) and is generally given bad press - unfairly as there are some chick lit gems out there. This isn't one of them, however.<br />After a couple chapters I started wishing that Marian Keyes or someone had written the darned thing - at least she'd have injected some life into an admittedly great plot idea. It was repetitive (check out the clumsy chapter in which Holly goes through her husband's stuff) and the humour was horribly flat. I didn't laugh (or indeed cry), though I may have smirked once or twice.<br />As for the characters, I rather liked Holly and her odd mix of strong and fragile. Her friends were stereotypes and the banter between them was painful at times. There seemed to be too many siblings - Jack in particular had no real purpose, his supposedly close friendship with Gerry introduced suddenly out of nowhere. Ah yes, Gerry. Holly's dead husband is extremely dull. How is buying a lamp supposed to be life-affirming?<br />All that said, there are some deft touches, especially towards the end of the novel; for example, the scene in the travel agent's and the part where Holly's boss tells her about visiting the botanical gardens in remembrance of his late wife.<br />I don't think it made any difference that Cecelia's father is the Taoiseach (that's TEA-shock for any non-Irish people; I suppose it's alright to call him PM, but I almost wept with happiness when an American referred to Bertie as his Irish title on TV recently). She admitted in an interview that it meant she \\"jumped the queue\\" at the publisher's, but it hardly accounts for the phenomenal sales worldwide. Bertie Ahern's not THAT much of a power-player; if Chelsea Clinton wrote a book, it'd be different.<br />Overall? Pretty disappointing.
B000060P79|1.0|I hate to break it to all you mainstream flavor of the moment  followers but bands like simple plan and good charlotte are NOT punk rock.  But you wouldnt know what punk rock is because im sure youve never heard a real punk rock song in your life being as the real punk bands dont feel the need to have a hit single blaring over and over again on your local top 40 hit radio station.  And i garuntee you that any song that gets played on a station like that is not a punk rock song.  Simple Plan are a bunch of whiny retards trying to look deep and soulful and make everybody feel sorry for them in songs like &quot;Perfect&quot; ohh my god have i never heard more untalented lyric writing in my life.  What i'm saying is if youre a 14 year old girl and have a wide array of simple plan, good charlotte, new found glory albums and thats all youve been exposed to...its not even really your fault that that is what you have been lead to believe is real punk rock.  Well its not...before you say that you like punk rock....go and get an album by The Deadboys or The Refused or Alkaline Trio and then if you enjoy it, you can say that your into punk rock.  And if you don't...well than thats cool at least your not living a lie.  Now you can just be honest about it.  When others ask you what kind of music your into you can simply say, &quot;I'm in to mindless pop radio punk wannabee crap.&quot;

B000059H99|5.0|The dialog, the plot, the supurb acting-- simply excellent!
0451169514|5.0|I truly lack the ability to discribe this book in a way that will do it justice but here it goes. This book is not a should read if your a horror fan, it is an absolute must read. Some feel that this book is a bit long.  Well, yes it is.  I for one though did not mind. In fact I wish it was longer. When you read a book that pulls you in the way IT does, you don't want it to end.  The characters are great, you truly care for them from the beginning, and the villian...well lets just say I never come across any better, anywhere.  This is one book that will give you chills and make your hair stand up on end.
B00005JL2O|3.0|I found this movie to be more entertaining than the 2nd installment so in that sense it was an improvement, however I would like to know why Beyonce was cast in this film? She is atractive, yes, but so is a good portion of Hollywood women and believe it or not-- Black Hollywood women if that is what their aim was. But alas, I have chalked it up to some good dealing with through her management and tried to look beyond her role at the overall movie. It was decent and I did laugh enough to say it is worth renting. Owning the DVD, on the other hand, is for those who want the deleted scenes which they did a god job of packaging.
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|This is not only one of the best war movies ever, but among the very best films period. The story is based on a true story of a German Submarine and its crew during WWII. The plot is simple. A bunch of ordinary young guys are crammed into a little tin can and go out and do their duty while trying to avoid getting killed. <br />It tells the tale of live aboard the &quot;boat&quot; from the boredom, the fear of death, the hell they go through trying to sink allied ships and the insane fear of the boat being crushed by the water pressure as you go too deep. <br />This film is unique in that it is done from the German perspective. Most films about WWII are from the Allied perspective since they were produced in Hollywood or England. What is striking about this film is how it depicts war as a human event rather than a nationalistic conflict. It makes us realize that for the foot soldier and sailor on the battle lines, no matter what side, war is the same. It is more a matter of survival than glory.<br />Highly recommend - my second favorite war movie.
B0001CNRS4|1.0|An MTV/BET hybrid film starring Jessia Alba who was clearly chosen for her looks. It is my understanding that she had to be taught how dance which baffles me because the last time I checked Mya is a trained dancer and since acting skills were not a prime concern, she could have done the role. I think the change in casting alone could have saved this movie from the absolute trash heap into at least renting class. After all, there would have been some real reason to expand on the dancing. Beyond that gripe, the numerous cliches were overwhelming to the point where my 13 year old younger sister could stand no more.
B00000JCOV|1.0|Slipknot has like 35 people in their band and their stuff is still simple enough for for a 4 man band to pull off.<BR>   <BR>   They wear masks for to reasons:  to get recognition and (according to a.c.) to hide the manly fluid stains on their faces. <br />   Do they think they are original using those vocals?  It's been done a million times and it was annoying the first.<br />   I noticed some moron called this CD revolutionary.  No, The Beatles were revolutionary.  People have been listening to their songs for 40 years and will continue for a many years more.  This is along the same lines as Papa Roach.  I once bet someone that in 2 years they will be forgotten.  I was in the 6th grade then.  Needless to say when I was in the 8th grade I got 15 dollars.  Slipknot will be done in 2-5 years.
B00005JKED|4.0|The acting is supurb by all, especially Denzel. I had some qualms about the type of character he played in order to get the statue, but actually seeing the movie put all that on the backburner. This film is not as cookie-cutter predictable as most cop dramas and in fact I was left honestly waiting to see what would happen next. There was a point where I felt the movie was dragging, but when the credits rolled I didn't feel at all cheated of my time or money.
B00006FDCD|1.0|I have read many reviews and they all complain about the novel being TOO long, &quot;over 1000 pages long&quot; they say. Well excuse me but many of the great literary works are extensive. This novel in particular is extensive due to the perfect description of places, chacarters, thoughts, etc.<br />Taking into account the enormous amount of detail and description put into this book, I think it would be more than clear to anyone  that MAKING A GOOD MOVIE OUT OF THIS NOVEL IS IMPOSSIBLE!!!!!!<br />-Please save yourself some money.<br />-Watch &quot;The Shining&quot;, that's good acting<br />-Read the book when you are 11, 12 or 13<br />-Read it again 10 years later<br />-Read it at night
B0001FR3IQ|1.0|The plot was boring and when it did hit a twist/turn I didn't have the interest to care. Halle's character barely developed beyond the screaming and I am still trying to figure out whether they ran out of ideas at the end or money? Either way, this movie is a waste.
0061015725|4.0|Michael Crichton has written some scary books, one might even say horror novels but he has never written a scary/horror novel in the conventional supernatural, Good versus Evil, sense and for me, that's what makes his novels even more scary. You see with Crichton's scary novels you can't keep reminding yourself that there isn't any such thing as Werewolves or Demon's or Ghosts or Zombies and especially Vampires. No, unfortunately his scary novels are based in Science and it's hard to say in this day and age of scientific miracles that there is no such thing as Science. Prey is such a novel.<br />PREY<br />Prey starts innocently enough with our main character Jack Forman being an unemployed Mr Mom to twelve year old Nicole, eight year old Eric and eight month old Amanda. It seems Jack, who was a Program Dept. Supervisor at MediaTronics INC. was also put in charge of security after his dept. discovered a pirated version of one of their softwares was being sold overseas.<br />This led, in the course of his investigations, to discovering his boss was involved in the theft and other things. Refusing to ignore these transgressions he informed a stockholder, who was involved with his boss and so six months previously Jack was unceremoniously dumped and blackballed.<br />Luckily, Jacks wife of fourteen years, Julia, is on the fast track at Xymos, another computer company and heavily involved in the development of a new groundbreaking molecular technology. In fact she's so busy that she's hardly ever around and when she is, she acts odd and disagreeable. After thinking about it and noticing that she's lost weight and dressing less businesslike and more seductive, Jack decides Julia's having an affair.<br />What is making Julia act so strange, so tense, so driven, and what made the baby red all over and so sick that she had to be rushed to the Emergency Room at the Hospital? And why did the baby's symptoms suddenly disappear when she underwent an MRI test and what was that crazy dream where Julia got in bed one night and turned all black like a cloak had been pulled over her, or was it a dream? Also what caused Julia to get in a car accident shortly after leaving the house after dinner and why when Jack was riding in the ambulance to the hospital did Julia make him promise to stay away from the Xymos project? Is she really having an affair? Jack's got to see what's going on!<br />Too bad that it's not the case. An affair would be mild compared to the mess Jack discovers at Xymos's secret Tonopah, Nevada plant shortly after he is hired as a consultant. Something is out of control, it's deadly, a threat to all mankind and it's up to Jack to stop it.<br />Conclusion<br />Michael Crichton has some of the most varied a unusual plots of any of my preferred writers. From the space borne disease in Andromeda Strain, to the tenth century, homicidal creatures of Eaters of the Dead, to the resurrected Dinosaurs of Jurassic Park and more, his stories are all over the place. Crichton's writing style and his ability to spin a yarn are impeccable, until Prey that is.<br />No, he still spins a good fast paced yarn, truly based on Science and that is where Crichton falters a little. In an effort to scientifically back up his story he goes into way too much detail on the scientific background of the elements of the story. True we are dealing with scientists and technicians but most of the readers are lay people. It wasn't overdone but the story would have flowed better if Crichton would have treated the book more as the novel it is.at crazy dream where Julia got in bed one night and turned all black like a cloak had been pulled over her, or was it a dream?

B000003EUL|5.0|In his notebooks, Richter himself tells repeatedly how strongly he disliked this performance of the Brahms Second. Most significantly, he blames Leinsdorf for pushing the tempo all the time. For the rest we have to guess for what his motives could be. After all, it is quite strange that the pianist in what is perhaps the best-loved of all Brahms B flat's doesn't like it himself. What could Richter have had in mind? Perhaps he had even greater ideas for this piece - but as it is here, I cannot possibly imagine. Richter gives probably the pianistically most perfect rendition of the concerto ever made, coupled with a musical insight that most of his colleagues could hardly dream of. And considering Leinsdorf: his accompaniment is very correct and I don't hear him pushing at any time - actually, Richter's playing is so dominant that it is the piano which seems to take the lead in the piece, not the orchestra. And that's fine with me.     I like it better than the also much-revered Gilels/Jochum recording: Gilels takes his time and is philosophizing around, but in the end he almost drowns in his own ideas. Richter's playing on the other hand is full of richness too, but never makes the piece excessively ponderous and storms right at the gates with utmost certainty. Similarly, Richter possesses all the power of a Serkin but avoids the latter's sometimes ugly neuroticism and his patronizing focus on rhythms. He takes about as many risks as Schnabel, but is pianistically more reliable. This all is not to say that we have the perfect recording of the Brahms here: pianists like Schnabel, Fleisher, Fischer, Anda, Curzon, Solomon, Brendel et al. show many insights for which Richter has no space. In fact, I'd perhaps take Solomon and Edwin Fischer over Richter in the end, but that's really splitting hairs.     There are many unforgettable moments here: the piano solo before the first orchestral tutti in the first movement blazes with fire and excitement - and complete technicalmastery. I've never heard it played as good as here. And then the following piano entry after 3 minutes - Richter's fantastic, illuminating tone and sonorous basses shine through so well here. And then, in the following minutes, we get a demonstration of how to connect phrases almost effortlessly (perhaps this is what the editorial reviewer refers to, although he has come up with his usual nonsense as well). The marcato after 7 minutes once again demonstrates his technical skills, but also an incredible feeling for rhythm and excitement. The tender scenes are just that - and a look forward to the great slow movement. The second Allegro I'd say has the same fury as in Serkin's recording, but Richter is far more flexible and less dogmatic. Richter's approach to the Andante is rock-solid and unfussy; it is wonderful to hear how he is able to play without any mannerisms and yet generate the highest level of expression. In the Allegretto, Richter's sweet but powerful tone again does small wonders; he seems to shape many small and lively episodes within this movement that is sometimes treated as a perfunctory and dull conclusion. Not here; the Allegretto makes the ideal end for this hugely impressive recording.     I haven't spilled a word yet about the Appassionata on this disc, and it should not be left unnoticed that this, too, is a masterful performance. The first movement is boldly shaped, with lots of contrasts in tempi dynamics. However, it perfectly adds up in the end and it betrays that SR had a strong sense of architecture as well. The slow movement is done solemnly and with beautiful tone-coloring. And there's the famous last movement that runs at incredible pace - and still Richter never loses control. Yet good as this one may be, it is completely outshined by a live performance by Richter in Prague from one year earlier - there he drops all his caution and you'll get more passion in the opening, more life in the slow movement and a final that is about the most exciting piano recording made, period. But enthusiastic as I am about even that live performance, the greatest Appassionata on record I believe is by Claudio Arrau (Philips), who is more faithful to the original text and responds best of all to the complex characteristics of this marvelous sonata. So, the recording included here is a nice dessert, but the main thing is definitely that wonderful Brahms which you just cannot afford to pass by. Certainly one of the finest documents of Richter's playing.

B00000IQC8|3.0|Getting this movie caused a lot of arguments. In the UK, we tend to pronounce it with an 'a' - so Clarks! But I'm being American, so I pronounce it Clerks, which sounds right to me, but wrong to everyone else. So I still say &quot;clerks&quot; but then correct myself afterwards. (Hey, I'm easily confused, they say &quot;clerks&quot; in the damn movie!)<br />If you've ever worked as a 'clerk', then you'll really identify with this film. I'm currently working as a waitress, so I didn't identify so much with Dante (although I do get a lot of stupid questions), but I did see a lot of a guy I know, who works in a video store, in Randal, the video store clerk! Much of his lines resulted in me laughing out loud, and saying that they were exactly the same! (Or I imagine them to be the same). My favourite line has to be where Dante says to Randal that he has a customer, and he turns round, with this expression on his face, and says &quot;What? What do you want?&quot;<br />This was one of the first outings for Jay &amp; Silent Bob, who are both legends. I already have Chasing Amy, Dogma, and now this on DVD, and am now after Jay &amp; Silent Bob Strike Back (I've seen it, just don't have it), and Mallrats. Both of which are proving very hard to get hold of, particularly Mallrats. I officially love Silent Bob (played by Kevin Smith), and despite him speaking in nearly every film in which he plays Silent Bob, I still get a shock when he does speak!<br />This film is very low budget, and filmed entirely in black &amp; white - which really annoyed me, as I thought my DVD player had gone wrong! (I've actually watched a whole film in black &amp; white - 8 Mile - thinking it was actually in black &amp; white, but my DVD player had decided to be stupid) The entire production costs for this film were $26,800. Combined, the cost of Clerks production and soundtrack was $50,000. This is approximately the cost per second of making Titanic! Also, there are not a lot of sets, and there are a lot of the same actors included. It's very much a film involving two main characters, who talk back &amp; forth. It can get quite tedious, between funny lines, and Jay dancing and singing (yeh!) yet again!<br />There's an alternate ending on the DVD, but I have to say I preferred the original ending. There are also a lot of deleted scenes, with introductions from Kevin Smith. I tend to skip most of these, as boy, does this guy like the sound of his own voice!<br />There are some terrific and extremely quotable lines (if only I could remember them, to quote to people!) in this! Some of the best are:<br />Dante Hicks: Are there any balls down there?<br />Jay: About the biggest pair you ever seen, dingleberry!<br />Randal Graves: You know who I could do without? I could do without the people in the video store.<br />Dante Hicks: Which ones?<br />Randal Graves: All of them.<br />[A series of clips]<br />Bed Wetting Dad: What would you get for a six-year-old who chronically wets his bed?<br />Video Confusion Customer: So, do you have any new releases in?<br />[Zoom out to see a huge sign that says &quot;NEW RELEASES&quot; directly above her]<br />Low I.Q. Video Customer: Do you have that one with that guy who was in the movie that was out last year?<br />Randal Graves: They never rent quality flicks. They always pick the most intellectually devoid movies on the rack.<br />Low I.Q. Video Customer: OOOOH! NAVY SEALS!<br />Randal Graves: It's like in order to join, they have to have an I.Q. that's less than their shoe size.<br />Dante Hicks: You think you get stupid questions? You should hear the barrage of stupid questions I get.<br />[More clips]<br />Cold Coffee Lover: What do mean there's no ice? You mean I gotta drink this coffee hot?<br />Candy Confusion Customer: So how much is this thing anyway?<br />[Zoom out to see a huge &quot;EVERYTHING ONLY 99¢&quot; sign behind her]<br />Hubcap Searching Customer: Do you sell hubcaps for a '72 Pinto hatchback? Ooh, Mini-Trucker Magazine!<br />Jay: Noinch, Noinch, Noinch, Schmokin Weed, Schmokin' Weed, Doin' Coke, Drinkin' Beers...<br />There's a few more, but I suppose it depends on your sense of humour.<br />Despite being a little slow, this is a good film, although not as good as Dogma (my fave Jay &amp; Silent Bob flick). Just prepare yourself for some tedious dialogue, including lots of s*x and Star Wars talk!<br />Jay: Noinch, Noinch, Noinch, Schmokin Weed, Schmokin' Weed, Doin' Coke, Drinkin' Beers... <br />There's a few more, but I suppose it depends on your sense of humour.<br />Despite being a little slow, this is a good film, although not as good as Dogma (my fave Jay &amp; Silent Bob flick).

B00005JMYG|3.0|Will Ferrell is probably the hottest and most in demand comedian in movies right now and deservingly of course.  He is an amazingly funny person.  He just sends of that impression of being an old creepy guy that uses stupid pick-up lines on girls and tries to hang out with the younger crowd.  Almost anything that he does turns out funny.  Well, except for this movie.  <br />Anchorman is about a new anchorman named Ron Burgundy (Ferrell).  His station is the number 1 rated news broadcast in the San Diego area.  Ron Burgundy is a sexist, extremely cocky person who is always trying to hook up with girls by saying \\"You know, I am famous.\\"  Along with the rest of his news team, all of them being male, they strut around town and are well known by everyone.  Well, the management at Channel 4, Ron's station, decides that they need a change and hire a female news reporter.  This does not sit well with Ron and the rest of the news team.  So after a brief relationship with the new female broadcaster (Christina Applegate), Ron decides to try to destroy her career.  This backfires against him and he becomes scum and then rises back to the top.  Enough said.<br />Now don't get me wrong, this movie had its funny moments.  The cameos by Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, and Jack Black (whose cameo turned out to be the funniest moment of the movie) were really good.  Steve Carrell was the funniest of Burgundy's news team.  The problem is that the movie felt like a really long SNL skit that started to get old after about 20 minutes.  During most of the movie, the audience was not laughing.  The movie had a lot of dry parts and moved at a much slower pace then, say, Dodgeball.  This wasen't a bad movie, its just wasen't what I was hoping for.
B00005JKCH|3.0|This was a total impulse buy. Plus, I recently bought a book on Easter Eggs on DVDs, and this was included - and I still haven't tried to find it!<br />Like all first comic book movies (X-Men etc), I found this film to be slow, as you have to introduce the characters, and for this, discover how Peter Parker got his powers. Like X-Men 2, I'm sure the follow up to Spiderman will be a lot speedier, and will pass quickly. There didn't seem to be much action, and when there was, it was in short bursts. In-between, there's a lot of talk, and it gets a bit tedious.<br />I just didn't see Tobey Macguire as Spiderman. Sure as the geeky little kid he is at the start, but when he removes his glasses, he looks like any ordinary guy. There's nothing special about him as an actor, apart from the fact he sometimes sounds like he's been sucking on helium. There have been many rumours about Jake Gyllenhaal replacing him before this was shot, as Tobey messed up his back, and I would have preferred Jake. But I guess we'll stick with Tobey.<br />Kirsten Dunst struck the right chord as Mary Jane Watson, although she comes across as a bit of a damsel in distress. She'll hopefully have a bigger part in the sequel - it looks like it from the trailer. Her red wig is also extremely fake looking, and I hope she keeps to her word and dyes her hair for the sequels. (And gets extensions - her short hair suits her, but it's so boyish sometimes)<br />Sometimes, I found the CGI to be absolutely awful in this. Sure, it probably would have looked better on the big screen (Titanic's another bad one for this - looks awful on the small screen, but that doesn't stop me watching it!). At some points, it looks more like a computer game, especially when Peter's practising his new found powers, and is running across the roofs of buildings. I didn't see it at the cinema, so I can't say how it looked on the big screen - but probably loads better.<br />As with all these movies, there's bits taken from other comic books, and bits similar looking to other movies. Of course, you had Clark Kent &amp; Lois Lane, and it's the same with Mary Jane &amp; Peter. Also, when you saw Spiderman sitting on top of buildings, there was a strong sense of deja vu, as it's so similar to the shots you see in Daredevil.<br />Of course, nearly every DVD I watch, I spot something connected with Friends. And I did in this! The Moondance Diner that Mary Jane works at, is the same that appeared in the early episodes of Friends (series 2 &amp; 3 I think), where Monica worked.<br />There's absolutely hours of extras to wade through on this, but it's mostly stuff I'm not really into - I like gag reels etc, and the actors messing up their lines, I don't really like going in-depth into how they did the fight scenes etc. These extras are: commentary by director Sam Raimi, Kirsten Dunst, producer Laura Ziskin and co-producer Grant Curtis; commentary by special effects designer John Dykstra and visual effects crew; &quot;Weaving the Web&quot;: subtitled pop-on production notes and historical facts<br />Branching web-isodes; Music videos: Hero (Chad Kroeger featuring Josey Scott), What We're All About (Sum 41); HBO Making of Spider-Man; Spider-Mania, an E!

078681859X|5.0|I checked the audio version of this book out of the library for my kids to listen to in the car. It is fantastic. The narrator captures the character of Bartemaeus perfectly. Even if you've read the book, I would recommend checking out the audio edition, you won't be disappointed. My son and I were \\"fighting\\" over our walkman to see who got to listen to the tapes out of the car.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|When I first got this album I thought it was OK, but nothing special.  I listened to it a few times and then put it away.  I just pulled it out again a couple weeks ago and WOW...all of the sudden it ROCKED!!  I have no idea why it suddenly appeals to me so much, but I really enjoyed it when I played it this time.  I enjoyed it so much that I went out and bought &quot;Images ans Words&quot; due to the good reviews of that album and I was NOT disappointed -  that CD is AMAZING!!  My favorite bands are Opeth, Pink Floyd, In Flames, The Cure, Hypocrisy, Katatonia, Into Eternity, Porcupine Tree and Tool, so if you have similar interests you might like Dream Theater.
B00008DDRX|5.0|Of course how can we forget the studious Steve McQueen. A real LeMans racer. In this video you'll be amazed to the sights and speed of LeMans in the early 70's. Seeing these cars reach 200mph in the 70's is very fun to watch, they slip and slide without any nannying electronics. Leading you think and compare them to the cars of today such as the Audi R8s. These are the dinosaur ages of LeMans. Slipping and sliding the cars of the 70s are very popular indeed. The Porsche 917s are amazing but few would recall it was a bright red one that crossed the finish line first, but hey this is a movie so they had a blue one cross the stripe. Its a great film to see where LeMans was in the 70s and the speed and excitement an endurance race offers. Seeing the Porsches battle the Ferraris for the lead not on the GT class but for the overall lead. The cars in the film are regarded as one of the best and should not be missed.

B0001Z52RU|2.0|\\"The Butterfly Effect\\" has its adherents, which I can appreciate, but I am not one of them. It is flashy and energetic. The acting ranges from acceptable to excellent. But its problem is that the screenwriters, Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber, who also directed the movie, were not able to carry their interesting premise to a satisfactory conclusion, either as entertainment or as profound statement. In other words, it doesn't work well as either art or as pop culture. <br />The movie is based on the theory of chaos, a plausible idea that supposes that the universe is not based on order but on chaos. <br />The protagonist, Evan [Aston Kutcher], who is his early 20s, has always had a memory problem. To counter this, he's kept journals since he was very young. Very bad things seemingly happen to Evan in his youth. Later, as he reads his entries, he is able to go back and rearrange the past. His efforts result in an uglier, more chaotic present. It never occurs to Evan that many of the events he is trying to change occurred only in his imagination. Maybe Evan himself is Chaos. <br />Kutcher is adequate as Evan. Melora Walters is very good as his mother. By far the best performance is given by Amy Smart. She plays Kayleigh, Evan's traumatized childhood friend, who grows up to be a college student, a forlorn waitress or a hooker, depending on how Evan changes the future. <br />If the writers had been able to flesh out their premise, this would have been a really interesting movie. As the story starts to flounder, the old `you can't change fate' premise comes in. Well, if you can't change fate, then there goes your theory of chaos, right?
B000002UVZ|5.0|This album is great from start to finish. There are no weak cuts and some of their greatest and most experimental songs of all-time. It does have a little more commercial appeal than their earlier stuff, but that is OK. If you don't know much about REM, I would recommend buying this one first, if you want to get off to the right start.
B000002LOE|2.0|This is by far my least favorite album by the boys. I thought then and still do today, that it was a wannabe commercial, sell-out recording. It lacked the soul of their earlier albums and the innovation of their later albums. This is a great band, but they dropped the ball on this one. Too sappy!
B0000AUHPG|5.0|If you have never been scared of Henry Fonda, this is the movie that will do it for you. The scene in the beginning, right after the whole family is killed is so eerie as the gunmen just appear silently from the brush. Henry Fonda's cold, killer eyes staring down the little child before he shoots him. Wow.<BR> <BR>This is a very well made film, nothing like is has been made in years. Every scene takes its time to build up the right mood. This is a movie to watch when you have alot of time and nobody is around to bother you. The DVD transfer is nothing short of amazing, the color and quality of this 35 year old film will leave you speechless.<BR> <BR>Claudia Cardinale is an absolutely stunning beauty, Charles Bronson is perfect as the vengeful quiet loner. I didnt expect Jason Robards to work well but he is very effective. <BR> <BR>Definitly a movie to buy, not just rent. Something to give to someone who really appreciates epic movies the way they used to make them.
B00005JLRT|5.0|Star Trek: TNG happens to be the best among all Star Trek Series EVER for me and growing up with this series on the sideline, it has been a part of my life. And they have come to their very last production of that series with this very sad farewell movie. I came out watching this movie with this familiar tugging in my chest, like you have when you are attending a funeral of a very close relative or friend.<br />This movie started with the most anticipated wedding of Riker and Troi, yes it is about time! While on their way to Troi's home planet, for the traditional naked wedding, they encounter a strange signal from an unknown source, which turns out of be a broken up android who looked like Data and it is not Data's evil brother. Trying to fix him, they continue course back to their original destination until Janeway (yes, yuck lol) contacted Picard about some political associated meeting and Picard agreed to help.<br />Arriving to some strange planet, Picard meet an unusual encounter with the leader, who looks exactly like him when he was way way way younger, who ironicly, is an exactly clone of Picard, and he extremely wants Picard bad. This is where the adventure really starts.<br />Gosh! I can't believe this is the end of TNG.
B0000CFW87|1.0|This album includes songs in English, Spanish, Italian and French.  No matter the language, the lyrics are gibberish.  One line just about caused to me to crash my car ... something about &quot;love is more than pain and deceit&quot;.  In what bizarro land does love equal deceit?  <br />To bad this kid doesn't get a better lyricist or sing old standards or something because this material rots.
6305907145|5.0|Besides the heavy splits from Jane Austin's novel, I think this movie is absolutely wonderful.  The characters are some of my favorites. I love Jane Austin novels, but I also believe that some license can be taken without offending anyone.  I really don't think Alexandre Dumas would sue the recent movie portrayal of THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO (starring Jim Caviezel) which was almost completely opposite of his novel.  If movies were exactly like books, then I wouldn't really have a desire to see them.  It's much more fun for me when I've read the book and I sit down to watch the movie and it throws me a curveball.  It puts the book in a different light and I see things from a different perspective.  THEN I choose which one I like.  It was the same for GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING and I like both versions of the story.  Life's too short to nit-pick about this kind of stuff.  Live it up!  Love the book AND the movie!
B0001AP12G|4.0|Prior to this cd, i didnt know much about Kanye West, but this was a pretty damn good debut. Some of the beats werent too good, and i think that's what kept this from a 5, but Kanye West delivers some great tracks in terms of what he has to say about the world. It's a great debut overall, and i LOVED the song &quot;Jesus Walks&quot;.
B00003CXCT|3.0|Despite appearing on the Fortune 500 list and being worshipped by throngs of devoted SW fans worldwide, George Lucas is a very insecure guy. When a movie star is insecure, what does he do? He gets a nose job. Now, when an actor gets a good nose job, it doesn't mean he becomes a better actor. The reverse, however, is not true. When an actor (or musician, in Michael Jackson's case) gets a bad nose job, the performance suffers because the audience is distracted. That's what has happened with the SE SW trilogy. The shoddy, pre-Jurassic Park CG \\"enhancements\\" are as subtle as the Stay Puff Marshmellow Man in the New York City skyline. <br />But what's really happening here is George is intentionally trying to distract us. From what? The storytelling. His insecurities as a writer have demanded that our attention be diverted from what's really important---the characters and the plot---to the pretty CGIs. This is completely unnecessary, at least for the original three movies. The original three demonstrasted his understanding of classical mythology and his ability to retranslate them in a modern-day setting. Mythologist Joseph Campbell said that all classical stories need to be retold in each generation, and George has done that for us. Like Greek myths, SW is simple on the surface and extremely complex underneath. You can easily tell someone what Episode IV is about: a young man must save a princess and destory the enemy's stronghold. Simple, efficient, classical. Episode I and II, on the other hand, cannot be explained so easily. Where do you begin? Because George knows this, that the stories are weak, he feels that he must compensate by adding layers upon layers of make-up. Remove the make-up, and alas, it's not a pretty sight . . .
B0000DD7LC|4.0|In a world where many female artist seem to think that over the top sexuality and vulgarity are instant keys to success Alecia is a welcomed exception. Alecia, who is both beautiful and talented, has proven that talent can rise above booty shaking. Man this girl's ability to write, play and sing blows my mind. The music here is remeniscent of the oldschool vibe but contemporary enough to keep the hip hop crowd happy. Alicia isn't isn't quite in the league of soul legends like Aretha, Patti, or Gladys. Her unspecatular rendition Knight's \\"If I Were Your Woman\\" proves that. Given time, however, Keys will become one of the greats. Aspiring young singers should take lessons from Alicia....real talent can take you to the top too.
B000002MUW|4.0|Perhaps the most underappreciated album in her catalogue, even more so than Erotica. This album is the last gasp of the true Madonna we all came to love before Kabbalah, electronica, and a new joy for preaching claimed her soul :p<BR>Starts off with a catchy song named &quot;Survival&quot; in which she sings &quot;I'll never be an angel, I'll never be a saint it's true, i'm to busy surviving, whether it's heaven or hell I'm gonna be living to tell&quot; which basically sums up Madonna in a nutshell. It's followed by the fabulous &quot;Secret&quot; with it's warm vocals and infectious production, then gets into two mediocre songs &quot;I'd Rather Be Your Lover&quot; and &quot;Don't Stop&quot; before picking up again with &quot;Inside Of Me.&quot; This song is supposedly about her mother but it never felt that way to me, either way it's good tune with sweeet lyrics. Next up is an instant classic, Maddy's kiss off to her critics during the Erotica era, &quot;Human Nature,&quot; &quot;Did I say something true, oops I didn't know I couldn't talk about you&quot; she says in an obviously irritated tone that is the perfect response.<BR>I could go on and discuss the remaining songs, which are all great, but now I wanna mention her voice. She sounds great on this album and it's obvious she worked real hard in the studio to pull off the tuneful and varied sounds she uses to color her vocal.<BR>All in all this was an excellent contribution to her discography and better than some of her later work.
B00005B4GU|4.0|There seem to be various and sundry reviews about Amnesiac: those that claim it to be the most astounding example of Radiohead's brilliance, and those that were less impressed by the collage of texture it presents.  So, I offer more noise to the already confused clamor by examining the points of contention.<BR>  Well, I don't really see Amnesiac as a sequel to Kid A, but the two albums are obviously linked (hence, the revisted 'Morning Bell' as title cut).  Many of the songs, such as 'I Might Be Wrong' and 'Knives Out,' first appeared during the Kid A tour and were probably penned around that album's production.  Apples from the same tree, you could say.<BR>  While Kid A was a cohesive whole where each song led into the other, Amnesiac is more a complilation as each song exists in independent musical space. The crunchy bass textures of 'Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors' provides a claustrophobic backdrop to the processed vocals, while the thick piano chords of 'Pyramid Song' are adrift on ambient synth swoops and orchestral strings.  'Life in a Glasshouse' takes a trip to the swing era with a horn section,  while 'Like Spinning Plates' plays the background backward while Yorke sing the melody foward but makes it sound backward with phrasing (confused yet?).  One thing is for sure: there's a lot going on in every track!<BR>  I think Radiohead was trying to expand their creative boundaries here (if they have any :) by trying different approaches and techniques.  The focus seems to be on the production methods and sound textures, as if they wanted to see what they could come up with.  As a result, some songs are great (like 'Knives Out,' one of their most straight-foward melodies highlighted by clear arpeggios) and others fall short (like 'Hunting Bears,' a guitar instrumental which is just kind of &quot;there,&quot; although it's very similar to the melody of 'I Might Be Wrong,' so maybe I'm missing the point).  <BR>All that being said, Amnesiac is a good CD that any Radiohead fan or fan of avant rock will want to pick up, and most will find it a satisfying 45 minutes; however, if you're looking for the conceptual and thematic sweep of OK Computer or Kid A, I'm afraid you won't find it.
0446677450|4.0|OK, first, the core messages of the book:  For those astute enough to grasp that capitalism isn't necessarily evil, and that libertarian ideals are only as flawed as the people to whom they are applied, there are very good concepts throughout this book.  I would recommend this to those who aren't religiously attached to socialism and have a sincere interest in, and backbone for, increasing their wealth.  But, I can't write a completely glowing review or make an unequivocal recommendation.<br />The reason there's more to this review than just &quot;good concepts, run out and get the book&quot; is that it is very frustrating at times to read, for a variety of reasons.  The copyediting needs work (I even felt a sense of relief when Kiyosaki referred to himself as a best selling author instead of a best writing author), there are flow/synchronization problems, there is fluff thrown in that could/should be removed, and repetition that annoys rather than illustrates.<br />It is not a perfect book by any means; however, it is one that I recommend reading, and with an open mind so that you don't block the basics with emotional (and off-target) defenses.  If you instantly reject something that you read, it's an emotional reaction that won't hurt anyone but yourself.  An intriguing passage in the book refers to Kiyosaki's own disagreement while listening to an audio tape by Peter Lynch, in which Kiyosaki says:  &quot;Instead of becoming arrogant and critical, I simply pushed 'rewind' and I listened... at least twenty times&quot; until he understood Lynch's message.  Perhaps he didn't agree, but he understood.  That sort of openness might be necessary while reading this book.
B00008YJH5|5.0|How can I put into words how great this is? \\"Surfer Rosa\\" is one of the best CD's I have ever heard. I am a huge Nirvana fan, and when I first heard this CD, even I had to admit to myself that this band, the Pixies, laid the basic blueprint for Nirvana. When you actually take the time to listen to the Pixies, if you know anything about music at all, you realize that without them, the whole Seattle sound phenomenon may never have happened.<br />This is just an amazing album. Messy, explosive, dirty, raw, brilliant -- those are just a few ways to describe it. Every track is great in its own way, but some standouts are \\"Bone Machine,\\" \\"Where Is My Mind?\\", and the Kim Deal-penned \\"Gigantic,\\" one of the best expressions of female sexuality I've ever heard. All of the instruments are excellent, particularly the drumming, and Black Francis' (Frank Black's) vocals are perfect. Some say the underproduction of Steve Albini is pretentious and unnecessary, but it's not -- it just means you have to listen a little harder, and that's a great thing.<br />I first heard this CD the day before yesterday, and I've listened to it six times since then -- that's how undeniably great it is. Do yourself a huge favor, and run out right away to buy this. If you like the kind of music that led you to be checking out Pixies albums on amazon, you'll love this album.
0743424425|5.0|The last great book King has written, The Shining is a classic in the field of haunted house books that every horror fan should read.  Its characters are strong, empathic, and real, and the situation absolutely terrifying.<br />Enjoy the Kubrick film for its director and Nicholson, but if you want to scare yourself silly, read this one--written before King appeared to stop thinking his work needed editing and his idea of characterization devolved into white-trash profanity-laden methane-spewing addlebrains.<br />Upon its publication, The Shining was to become the standard by which all subsequent horror novels would be judged--a standard approached only, perhaps, by the truly frightening, underappreciated Ghosts, by Noel Hynd.
B00006879E|4.0|For all those people who think that Maroon 5 are a lousy band, then you have no taste in different kinds of music. Come on, broaden your horizons.<br />Maroon 5 blends a kind of jazz, rock, pop and easy listening into their songs and the end result is simply marvellous music that is good to listen to in the car or on a lazy sunday morning.<br />My picks are She Will Be Loved and Secret...
B000000HHE|5.0|next to the beastie's paul's boutique, my favorite rap album. it's just so celebratory and fun. just as with most rap albums, the skits are interesting and occasionally humorous the first time around but get exceedingly tedious upon subsequent listens. nevertheless, there are PLENTY of actual songs here, and the vast majority of them are fantastic.
0446607274|5.0|And so do authors.  It's nice that authors can write about aging protagonists as they themselves pass through the decades.  <br />Apparently, movie actors and other entertainers have a harder time with this transition, because so much depends upon their appearance.  We see authors only on the book jackets, usually, but some writers, like Janet Evanovich, decide to leave their protagonists at one age only.  <br />I think it's more realistic the way Connolly is doing it with Harry Bosch.  Harry's  a lot mellower now that he's retired, but he's still a bulldog about his mission in life, which has something to do with sticking up for the under &quot;bull&quot; dog.  <br />You'll like this book, if you have these same preferences.  Living in Los Angeles helps to make everything near and dear also.  Diximus.
B000000XBC|4.0|first tier fans need to go straight to the recently released box set, which contains their entire recorded history. fogerty didn't write a bad song for three years, and there were lots and lots of songs. with that said, here's some words on this particular release:<br />it's vastly inferior to volume 1, but i knew that when i bought it for five bucks or so way back in the day. nevertheless, this collection is full of great jams and wonderful bayou-influenced wailing...it should function perfectly fine as a cool-down after listening to vol. 1. &quot;wrote a song for everyone&quot; is fogerty's forgotten masterpiece, and &quot;pagan baby&quot; shows how great CCR could be when they stretched their own sonic boundaries.
B00005JMYG|3.0|Anchorman is the story of Ron Burgandy, top anchorman in San Diego in the 1970's. Burgandy, played by Ferrell, heads the top news team in San Diego. The 4 men that make up the team are sexist and egotistical, thinking that women bow to them. This is evident when Ron uses pick-up lines such as \\"Do you know who I am? You should. I'm famous, people know me.\\" The Channel 4 news team has it good as the #1 rated news team until their boss decides to add some diversity to the team by bringing in a woman, Veronica Corningstone (played by Christina Applegate). The crew is outraged that a woman is being allowed to do a man's job, and what ensues is a battle between Ron and Veronica over who is a better anchor. Eventually Veronica gets Ron fired accidentally, and Ron goes into a 3 month depression (where he is always drinking milk) until only he can be called on to report the biggest story of the year. To add to all of this, the team has to compete with other news stations around San Diego. To me the funniest part in this movie was the fight scene among all of the local stations, including the public access channel. Here we get cameos from Vince Vaughn, Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller (anchor for the Spanish news station!) and in other parts Jack Black appears. There are many great moments in this movie, with some good catch phrases to boot. I just didn't think this came together as a complete movie. Another reviewer said it was like a long SNL skit and I could not agree more. Overall I don't think this is a great movie but you should see it anyway. It has a lot of crazy lines in it that will crack you up for most of the movie, but isn't that what you would expect from a movie with a comedian as crazy as Will Ferrell is?
B00004BZ0N|5.0|the best album i've bought since the strokes, and when it comes down to it, so much better than the strokes it ain't even funny. this band sired the strokes. i've never been a big punk fan, but this isn't punk...it's way better than just that. this album covers just about every music genre there is, opera and country aside. absolutely amazing...not a single poor track on the entire record--and it's loooong. it came out the year i was born, 1979, and i have no idea why it hasn't gotten more credit outside the punk community. i mean, all the critics loved it, and still do, and it's considered classic, but it's also very accessible, immediately affecting/inspiring. so good. favorite tracks: &quot;rudie can't fail,&quot; &quot;hateful,&quot; &quot;train and vain,&quot;...the last one of which you've probably all heard, whether you know it or not. <br />easily one of the greatest albums ever released by any band in any genre, during any decade.
0790729350|5.0|It's inevitable that arguments will take place, as they do in these reviews, about what the meaning of Woodstock really is -- many have evoked peace and anti-vietnam sentiments and a great social movement, while others take a more mocking tone and dismiss it as a kind of upper middle class fantasy camp, a sewing of the oats before beginning corporate life.<br />Not having been alive in the 60s, I only know what I've read and been told by those older than myself, but I'd guess that the first assessment is a bit idealistic, while the second is unfair, and that the truth is &quot;somewhere in between,&quot; to fall back on the cliche.  <br />What the film does successfully document, I gather, is what it felt like to be young and hippie and excited about music and social protest and all the things Woodstock at least appeared, at the time, to represent. The feeling is what's embodied in the filmic techniques, the scenes chosen, and the performances themselves, and this makes Woodstock a successful documentary.<br />The 60s were many things, and no film could capture all of them. Actually, in spite of the fact that it allows itself to get very much caught up in the excitement, I think the film has its moments of ironic distance and sobering reality, such as the port-a-san scene (particularly the extended shot of the average joe cleaning the things). <br />For a good counterpoint, I recommend the Isle of Wight festival film, which captures the darker, more selfish side of the hippie generation.
B00000272N|5.0|In the 1990's glam metal aka hair metal was dying (even though myself Like that genre), so the music industry needed a change and this is the album that change the face of music, every single song was so beautifully constructively it even blew that no-talented nirvana right out of the water, man in the box was one of the greatest songs ever in the 1990s and that was the true explosion my friends from seattle.<BR>Alice In Chains was one of the best bands to ever came out of seattle and one of the best bands of the 1990's<BR>way better than nerdvana's nevermind.<BR>Big Thumbs Up for Me.
B00003CXE7|4.0|this is a three star movie with a five star dvd. one of the biggest problems with the movie was the first battle. i was expecting braveheart quality but ended with a battle less entertaining than the one in dragonheart. the blurry camera and closeups made it impossible to tell what was happening. if you want to see a movie like this but better, see the last samurai or braveheart.
B000000WA4|5.0|Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness is the best release by the Pumpkins, and one of the best collection of music ever.  The arrangement and layout of the music is flawless and the tempo manages to remain unpredictable yet somehow correct through the entire album.  There are just too many songs to talk about, but my favorites are definitely &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot;, &quot;Jellybelly&quot;, &quot;Here Is No Why&quot;, &quot;Bullet With Butterfly Wings&quot; (with what is arguably Jimmy Chamberlain's greatest drum performance), &quot;To Forgive&quot;, &quot;Galapagos&quot; (great lyrics &quot;If we died right now/This fool you loved/Somehow is here with you), album epic &quot;Porcelina of the Vast Oceans&quot; (plays out like a Shakespearan play), &quot;Bodies&quot; (which reminds us &quot;Love is suicide&quot;), &quot;1979&quot; (modern rock hit, the events mirror what probably happened to the youth in 1969, 89, 99, and probably 09 as well, brilliant song, hopeful lyrics), and megaunderrated &quot;Thru the Eyes of Ruby&quot; (another album epic with the line &quot;The night has come to hold us young&quot;, which gives ultimate hope to a generation that is somehow managing to lose its way).<br />Ten tracks listed above, these are the ones that truly stand head and shoulders above the remaining.  Not to take anything away from the others as they are role players and role players are also important in every great album.  Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness is what the 90's were all about, and it makes me proud to have been getting into good modern music (nothing beats classics) when this album, along with efforts such as (What's the Story) Morning Glory? by Oasis, The Bends by Radiohead were the great albums, and major breakthroughs not only in musicianship, but also in terms of a band having the substance, the guts, the mojo.<br />Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness is brilliant in every sense, and Billy Corgan in his prime as a frontman.  Highly recommended.
B000286RKW|5.0|best mafia movie i've ever seen, though i haven't seen the godfather. can't wait for the commentary with the criminal and fbi agent.
B000294SFW|5.0|I had no idea that Lemmy and thr gang had a new album out until a few days ago.  I ran out and picked it up as soon as I heard and I was blown away.  After Hammered, I thought they might be losing their touch a bit, it was a little slower and choppier then some of their previous efforts.  Inferno picks up the torch where We Are Motorhead left off.  Fast, loud and a combo of metal, rock and blues, this album shreds.  <BR>Nay sayers beware, they are Motorhead and they have come to kick your ass.
6305263248|3.0|this was kind of dissapointing, but i had pretty high expectations. it didn't really do anything wrong, but dispite a lot of action, it wasn't the most interesting movie.

B00000JGHM|5.0|this movie has some of the best acting i've ever seen. the plot is great and the action scenes are also great. the dvd i'm reviewing now lacks extras, but a special edition is supposed to come out later this year. some might not like it being three hours, but i think the three hours i spent watching were well worth it.
0451167716|4.0|now dont get me wrong i love the book. i gave it four stars however because of the incredibly boring excess of parts about johnny fontane,lucy mancini, etc. the rest of the book is an amazing portrayal of the world of the mafia but not only that but their families as well. it illustrates the concepts of honor, loyalty and justice in a setting where if you think about it seem like they would matter little. we are talking about career criminals here. i think thats what really draws our intrest. the fact that we grow to love characters that have such good qualitities and away from the crime setting would be considered wonderful people. just my opinion.<BR>i could hardly put this book down...except i was staying up to early hours of the morning to read and drowsiness overtook me. some aspects of the book are better than the movies...like how it explains the actions and motivations of some of the smaller players more. but the movie i am grateful skipped over many insignificant parts that were unnecessary. both are amazing so check them out!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|As worded by amazon, \\"How do you rate this DVD?\\" . . I have to give the DVD one star.  I review the MOVIE further down, giving it four stars.<br />About the widescreen verison DVD . . . <br />Universal Studio Home Video managed to taint viewing experience before a frame of the movie was ever played.  This DVD leads off with movie previews that can NOT be skipped, nor can you jump to the main menu while the previews are playing.  You can only fast forward.  This is the only DVD I've ever purchased that forces you to sit through their advertisement.  It is infuriating that I am force-fed this spiel watching a DVD (that I purchased - studio can do what it wants with rental versions)while in my living room.  <br />The studios finally do something consumer-friendly (or is it just a strategy to combat pirated copies?) by releasing DVDs with sub-twenty-dollar prices and then take one step backwards by doing something as annoying as this.  <br />About the Movie . . .<br />Chances are if you consider buying this movie, you have an idea what the plot is.  I give the movie a four star rating.  The most impressive element of the movie is how it succeeds in conveying Bob Harris' (Bill Murray) and Charlotte's (Scarlett Johanson) feeling of isolation in a foreign land.  Their relationship is seeded by this mutual alientation and the viewer follows along as they draw strength from each other to make their stay bearable.  The two are in very different stages in their lives and it seems their relationship is one of convenience based on being stuck in Japan, but we learn they have much in common.  Both are at crossroads in the marriage and careers.  <BR>The movie could have gone the easy route and become a \\"Man-with-midlife-crisis-has-fling-with-younger-woman,\\" cliche, but challenges the audience to follow two people who make a connection and slowly (and sometimes awkwardly) build a relationship.<BR>Bill Murray is completely believable as a broken-down actor in Japan to make a commercial.  Scarlett Johansson is great as Charlotte.  A lesser performance and the character would have been reduced to the stereotype.  <br />In short:  A good movie.   An annoyingly packaged DVD by Universal Home Video.
B000062YAZ|5.0|BEHOLD, THE MOST BRUTAL ABOMINATION IN THE HISTORY OF RECORDED MUSIC!<BR>     Simply put, this album is the zenith of heavy metal; it came out in 1986 and everything since then has really just been an afterthought. To say this is a classic death metal album is actually selling it short. More accurately, this is nothing less than a classic ROCK album, period, and anyone with even a passing respect for avant-garde or extreme music should give this one a listen.<BR>     To sum it up, Slayer captured the entire spectrum of human misery, aggression, and wickedness and condensed it into its purest form on this album. It's pretty amazing to think about the places the band had to go to in their minds in order to bring this to life (I imagine chronic depression and marathon drug use played a significant role). Basically, this album has it all: mass murder, demonic possession, insanity, cannibalism, necrophilia, witchcraft, mutilation, suicide, ritual sacrifice, heresy and blasphemy, Doomsday-- you name it. And the fact that it is all presented in less than 30 minutes gives you an idea of the inhuman speed in which it all happens. Sure, all of these themes have become obsolete and even the musical style itself is a little outdated (it's still lots of fun, though) but you've gotta realize that to say this music was extreme when it came out in '86 is a huge understatement.<BR>     From the heart-stopping opening riffs of 'Angel of Death' to the final, ominous thunderclaps of 'Raining Blood', the music remains raw, gruesome, and vicious, never straying from the relentless, bloodthirsty drive of unchecked animal instinct. This music is not to be taken lightly: its power is intoxicating in that it only serves to instigate the most destructive, inhuman impulses lurking in all of us. Even to this day, the album really tears down the popular definition of 'listening enjoyment'. Psychologically, it can only have one of two effects: a quick, nasty catharsis that allows you to let off some steam or... a negative, emotional shove over the edge that causes you to smash empty bottles on someone's head or go on a crazed killing spree at the shopping mall. Either way, listen at your own risk; anyone that is sensitive, easily-offended, or emotionally unstable would be well-advised to think twice before letting this ghastly beast of an album into your life.<BR>     And for all you others adventurous or dumb enough to do so--yeah, just turn it up, push 'play', and PREPARE TO DIE!!!!

0156027321|5.0|I crave literature that leaves me with a sense of deeper understanding of the universe through artistry of language and character interactions.  This story gave me a notion of what is required for survival, not only when shipwrecked at sea, but in a world where each day brings challenges and fears of various levels of difficulty.  As Martel states, &quot;The world isn't just the way it is.  It is how we understand it, no?&quot;  There are few of us who could understand the perils of Pi's experience, yet many of us who know the pain of survival from our own perspective.  I know that I will return to these earmarked pages for spiritual uplift on my own weary days.  Most notably page 209, &quot;Despair was a heavy blackness that let no light in or out.  It was a hell beyond expression.  I thank God it always passed...the blackness would stir and eventually go away, and God would remain, a shing point of light in my heart.&quot;<br />After just finishing Pi's tale, I feel a greater connection to the universe and relationships among creatures here.  I have found opportunities throughout my reading to share what I had read with others in conversational topics about religion and pets as well as struggles with clinical depression.<br />I believe in Pi as I believe that anything is possible with faith.  I recommend this book for anyone in their spiritual journey.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|This album is a really fantastic follow-up to Avril's fantastic debut album.  It is similar to the first and at the same time very different.  Yes, it is very angsty, but in a way that can be related to.  The raw emotion in this album is very appealing.  Unlike a lot of the other anger bands that try to channel their songs into hatred of everyone and everything, Avril's music is erergetic, catchy, singable and fun.<br />I am a 30-something music fan who has been left behind by a lot of the current pop/bubble gum/dance junk that is out there and it is very, very refreshing to hear some music I can get excited about.  I recommend this (and 'Let Go') to anyone who is looking for something edgier and more honest than the current fare on adult contemporary or pop/hot hits radio.
B000059H99|5.0|I sometimes wonder how many people under the age of twenty-five have never taken the time to view this film. I would hope the number is low. This is a movie that can inspire anyone, not just boxers or athletes. This movie is about taking that \\"one\\" shot, many of us sometimes get, and doing something with it - really using that chance.<br />Rocky is a film about overcoming what seems to be impossible odds with sheer character; a simple mind does not equal a simple soul, and as Rocky Balboa clearly demonstrates - when you get the shot you've always dreamed of, make it worth every second. Sylvester Stallone did just that - he wrote a novel about getting that one big shot, and it became his one big shot. The actor, director, and producer takes a lot of ridicule from the artsy-fartsy crowd but most of that is just plain jealousy; a forceps delivery left Stallone with a speech impediment, but his brain is just fine.<br />As another reviewer stated recently, if by some chance a person has not seen this film, they need to - it is in a class by itself.<br />See ya next review<br />[...]
031286504X|5.0|Great book - genuine masterpiece of SF and horror.<br />However, don't read any more reviews as half of the reviewers seem to think that a review consists on revealing all of the plot (including twists) and will definitely spoil your enjoyment of this book.<br />The only plot a person can reveal without spoiling it is the stuff that's in the blurb (the bit on the back cover). If you want to know what the book is about then go read it! The only people who won't like it are the people who think that Freddy Kreuger is the pinnacle of intellectual horror.
0393324818|5.0|A great book for the thinking baseball fan.  Billy Beane built a contending team on a low budget by going against the grain. It is interesting that he himself was a promising baseball player who failed to pan out. It is rather coincidental that his style is quite similar to the Oakland Raiders football team's method of picking players that are not heralded by other teams.  A team of misfits.  Unlike many teams, including our Seattle Mariners, Beane does not sell player personalities to the fans.  All of his players are movable parts and anyone can be dealt at any time.  The one question that I have is why is he giving away all his secrets?
B000002H97|5.0|Every album up to Load was awesome for me, and this album is pure adrenaline rock. Definately one of their best.  I don't agree with the last review, Enter Sandman is an awesome track.  Sad but True is my fav on this one though.
B000002UAU|4.0|This is the most overrated album of all time.  It's one of those things that has such massive hype surrounding it that people only say it's the best because they've been told to say so, and have been told so so often they believe it's true, because no one ever questions it, and anyone who speaks up on the matter is shot down angrily.  This isn't even the best Beatles' album out there; 'Revolver,' 'Abbey Road,' and the White Album are all better than this dated overrated overhyped project.  When Paul talks about this in interviews, he does not come across as humble.  Earth to Paul:  A band giving a concert is not an original concept, or even a concept at all.  Only three of the thirteen songs even relate to the alleged &quot;concept.&quot;  And there were concept albums before this, they just weren't called concept albums or thought of as such.<br />The songs for the most part are enjoyable ditties, if dated, but they're not the greatest songs The Beatles ever did.  Only &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; qualifies as a classic; &quot;Lucy&quot; comes pretty close too.  &quot;She's Leaving Home&quot; is very pretty, but not what I'd consider one of the songs in their classic canon.  &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot; is popular too, but again, it's not one of the songs most people would give as their greatest 20, 25, or however many they want to put in the top echelons of their catalogue.  All of the instruments, layers, double-tracked vocals, overdubs, and sounds do nothing but to put layers of gold on top of dreck.  And everyone knows deep down that the dreck is still there.  More layers does not equal more quality.  And I love &quot;Within You Without You,&quot; though apparently a lot of people hate it, but it's safe to say that most non-Indian songs with Indian instruments in them were recorded in the late Sixties and early Seventies.  It dates it right off the bat.<br />Of course, the hype surrounding this album is impossible to get away from.  People will still automatically put it at the top of &quot;the greatest albums ever&quot; lists or spew empty hype about it being the best ever, without having taken time to really evaluate it.  There are other concept albums, true concept albums, from this period in time, which have aged well and don't stand out like hideously dated bloated jokes.  Don't let the classic cover disguise the fact that there's nothing but an empty shell beneath the fancy exterior.ll still automatically put it at the top of &quot;the greatest albums ever&quot; lists or spew empty hype about it being the best ever, without having taken time to really evaluate it.

B00024BHTC|1.0|Imagine Omen with a Rock Riff behind that was done 20 years ago, and a vocalist that can't sing. Well that's Nightwish.
B000002L99|5.0|Been a huge fan of Van Halen all my life and i gotta tell ya this cd rocks Eddie has some very powerful riffs not suprising he usually always does the quality of this cd is excellent by far i truly love this cd basically because it was the debut cd involving Sammy Hagar which yeah he isn't quite as crazy as David Lee Roth but that is not always a bad thing i feel Sammy has brought alot to the band and makes a perfect frontman for Van Halen to me his vocals are alot more solid than David Lee Roths more powerful with meaning he shows emotion when he sings not just screaming or rambling on i feel that 1984 was a let down honestly i mean it was good but too much keyboard work and not enough rockin 5150 and VH 1 are the best 2 cd's they have released in my opinion .
B000002H70|5.0|I purchased a copy of this album on vinyl in 1990 and used it to soothe my soul after a particularly difficult breakup with a girlfriend of mine.  For a year I did nothing but listen to this album (along with Joy Division) and it really helped me get through some tough times.  &quot;Pictures of You&quot; has got to be one of the most powerful and sad songs ever.<br />I hadn't listened to it in over 12 years when I bought a used copy of the CD recently - and to my surprise I found that it was as moody, beautiful and wonderful as ever.  It hasn't aged at all.  This is one of those CDs you can put on in your player and just hit replay forever.  It really took me back to a time in my life where I was going through a lot of hurt - and it still has a restorative and theraputic power that amazes me.
B00004STDN|4.0|A previous reviewer called CLIFFHANGER a \\"guilty pleasure,\\" and that is pretty much the way I see the film.<br />CLIFFHANER was a return to action form for its star Sylvester Stallone, after he had made his indelible mark on the genre with his RAMBO trilogy in '80s. His character here, Gabe Walker, is drastically scaled-down, befitting the film's \\"high\\" concept, which is basically \\"DIE HARD on a mountain.\\"<br />Okay, so the premise (which is actually credited in this movie to a man named John Long) is not breathtakingly original---a nasty group of robbers led by evil Eric Qualen (John Lithgow, effectively playing his role to the hilt) lose three cases of American money in the Rockies and force Walker and companion Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker, he of HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER) to help them find it. Director Renny Harlin---who also directed DIE HARD 2---brings all his action expertise to bear on the thin plot and actually succeeds in crafting a good action film out of it. He was lucky in getting cinematographer Alex Thomson on his team, and Thomson makes the most of the Italian Dolomites (standing in for the Rockies) mountain settings by creating shots that revel in its scenic grandeur and impart an appropriately dizzying sense of vertigo to the proceedings. And Harlin uses his penchant for fast action pacing to good effect here, generating an exciting sense of momentum that hardly ever lets up until the final showdown.<br />So, as action entertainment, CLIFFHANGER can be counted as a success. So why do I find it a \\"guilty\\" pleasure rather than simply a pleasure? Well, I have to admit that I found some of the violence in the second half of the film a little too much at times---not only gratuitous but sometimes downright brutal. The first half of the film is much more discreet with the bloodshed, relying more on genuine suspense-building and awesome special effects and stunts to make its proper effect (the first twelve-minute sequence is arguably the last word in sweat-inducing suspense and mounting tension). In the second half, though, the script (credited to Michael France and Stallone) and director let rip with gory abandon, and thus we get images of a black bad guy getting skewered upon a stalactite by the hero, and scenes like Tucker being kicked in the ribs and nose like a soccer ball for a good minute or so by a British terrorist (with some tasteless slo-mos to draw out the grand brutality). Did we really need to be subjected to such witless violence? Do the filmmakers assume that we are all so base in our tastes that we actually get turned on by this bloody stuff? Well, who knows? Maybe they have a point there, since I admit that the first time I saw this film I was shocked but hardly appalled by the violence on offer here. It is only after having seen it a few times since then that I am starting to question the validity of the violent scenes on offer here. Harlin started the film out so well, but then, after about an hour or so, it turns into a second-rate one-upping of icicle-in-the-eye scene in his superior DIE HARD 2.<br />Notwithstanding my unease about the violence in this movie, though, it must be said that CLIFFHANGER works. It is sometimes very exciting and suspenseful, the performances basically get the job done, and overall this is one of the better DIE HARD clones, thanks to some great cinematography and noteworthy action scenes. If neither of the first two DIE HARD films are available for rental, this will fit the bill. Just don't be surprised, after it is over, if you feel a little guilty about having enjoyed it as much as you did.
B00008DDSC|5.0|Secretary goes about solving the problem of &quot;finding the right one&quot; in quite a humerous and riske manner.  S&amp;M!  Now before you jump to conclussions, you are not going to be barraged with images Betty Page look-a-likes and more torture devices than you can shake a stick at, don't worry.  I can see how this film got its R rating, but it still goes about presenting this material it in a almost tame manner.  It shows how two people with different, yet equally debilitating shy demeanors, can through extreme socially taboo means, discover that they are soulmates. I say that this movie is a must see for those who have a taste for the bizare, along with happy endings.
0790731002|2.0|This film has a suitable \\"Two-Face\\" style reaction for me. On the one hand it is a relief after the nasty darkness of 'Batman Returns' it is also a disappointment in terms of character development and overall Feel. Val Kilmer's Batman is a pouty, emotionally stunted wet blanket(not his fault but the director's), Nicole Kidman's character is a slut, Chris O'Donnel's Robin spends the entire movie acting like a punk, and Jim Carrey plays Ace Ventura, I mean the Mask, uhh.. Riddler.<br />  The thing that really makes me mad though is taking a Great Actor, Tommy Lee Jones, Cast him as a Great Character, Two-Face, and Making him perform him like he was the Joker and under-develop him to the point that he plays second fiddle, no pun intended, to JIM CARREY! CURSE YOU SHUMACHER!<br />  If the film had centered around Two-Face and Bruce's guilt for not being fast enough to help him, it would have been great! But that is almost an after thought in the actual film. Blaming Two-Face for the Death of Robin's parents sets him up to be a \\"Robin\\" villain, Something more suitable for Riddler or the Penguin.<br />  All this ranting aside, Tommy is the only Main Character who is actually convincing in the film. It's too bad he wasn't able to work with Tim Burton and Michael Keaton on a film that was worthwhile.<br />  Elliot Goldenthal Wrote the music but it pales in comparison with Elfman's work on the first two films.<br />  I was hoping there would be deleted scenes on the DVD but there aren't any. Most of Tommy's Scenes are in the movie, but some juicier moments were cut. Oh well.
B0000009UX|5.0|This is definitely Elvis Costello's best work to date.  All of the songs are strong with nary a dud on the album.  It's also notable that the additional songs that were provided for this CD version are great too.  If you are new to Elvis's work, this is the best place to start.
B00028HBKM|1.0|Why do I dislike this movie? This movie is a very nice way to give Christian fanatics lots of ammo. And I'd like to tell you fanatics of any kind can be dangereous, not just Muslim fanatics as many Americans tend to be. Fanatics of NyQuil could potentially be dangerous, so don't give Christian fanatics something else to use against anyone who may happen to have a different belief that they do. <br />Did Jesus go through this? Something like it, probably not exactly. Does Mel Gibson deserve the money he makes? No. Did Mel Gibson take a risk? No. He already had a large audience that would go see the movie even if no one else would. But he knew everyone would go see it because it's controversial. Controversy make a lot of money, look at Eminem. <br />This movie is not a life changing experience because it is a movie. People shouldn't be guilted into Christianity because they saw an actor pretending to be Jesus get tortured.
B00018D44U|5.0|If you liked the 8 Grammy award-winner &quot;Come Away with Me&quot;, you will definitely appreciate &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; just as much. Don't let the naysayers who gave one star to this excellent production sway you, they should probably listen to the likes of Britney Spears to find the kind of &quot;excitement&quot; they're looking for.<br />The CD starts with &quot;Sunrise&quot;, which not only is one of the most original songs penned by Norah (with Lee Alexander), but it is also a very delightful piece of music. BTW, watch the lovely bucolic and cartoonish video (available on Yahoo's launchradio and elsewhere on the net), which will somehow remind you of the &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;... My other favorite tunes in this CD are &quot;Those Sweet Words&quot;, &quot;The Long Way Home&quot; and, above all, &quot;Don't Miss You At All&quot; -- a Duke Ellington piece, with added Norah Jones lyrics -- which, with &quot;Sunrise&quot;, is alone worth the price of the CD. All songs are the usual delightful blend of country, blues and jazz, showcasing the sultry and haunting voice of Norah. The almost all-acoustic arrangements are just as sophisticated as those of her previous production, never getting in the way of Norah's voice but always providing an excellent sonic tapestry.<br />Compared to &quot;Come Away with Me&quot;, this CD has a more country feel and slightly less jazzy overtones, and that's probably why overall I like her previous production a little more, but I understand that's just a personal preference.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I hate the image of slipknot, i don't think you need an image to sell your music...and for the record, anyone who claims they've been listening to slipknot since their first cd, is lying, you know you didn't start listening to slipknot until their self-titled. Anyways, i was never a fan of slipknot, and after the release of &quot;iowa,&quot;i was the farthest from a  fan as you can get.But just becuase i don't like this bands image...doesn't mean i don't like their music(this cd).Self-titled was good, ingenius, but not my thing. Iowa, you can tell slipknot tried for a heavier approach, cd was really bad, but it was still differnt. Now this cd, was more of a softer aproach...alot softer. Considering 2 songs are acoustic. This cd is much more artistic, and ingenius, then their last two, and blows the &quot;mate&quot; e.p out of the water, then again, that was just a horrible cd to begin with, but with that said, this is a must have, and that's saying alot, becuase i'm not even a slipknot fan, but i can't deny good music
B00005YW4H|5.0|In a world where the new &quot;singing sensations&quot; are the unoriginal screamers who participate to &quot;American Idol&quot; and similar TV monstrosities, it's really refreshing to witness the rise of a REAL talent with a REAL music background and an exceptional panache for musical &quot;buon gusto.&quot;<br />Norah doesn't have a &quot;big&quot; voice, so what? Neither did Billie Holiday, but I'll take her over any screamer at any time. It's not by chance that I mentioned Billie Holiday, because that's the kind of voice Norah reminds me of, and I simply love it. Sultry, smoky and haunting are the three adjectives that immediately come to my mind.<br />On to the music, Norah's songs are a delightful blend of country, blues and jazz, all encased by electronic-free arrangements (i.e. real singers need no walls of synthesizers and special effects to cover the flaws of their voice...) and some very tasteful but unobtrusive piano playing by Norah herself.<br />I basically like all songs in this album, but my favorites are the title track (&quot;Come Away with Me&quot;, a really delightful jazzy waltz), &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; (a Pat Metheny-esque tune featuring a beautiful melody and an exceptionally tasteful arrangement) and the amazing &quot;The Nearness of You&quot;, where Norah showcases her incredible ability to perform immortal standards with nothing behind her voice but her own superb piano accompaniment.<br />The fact that this album received 8 Grammy awards makes me a little less pessimistic on the future of pop music.
014100018X|4.0|In this lusciously mystical novel, Vianne Rocher and her young daughter Anouk arrive in a small French village on Mardi Gras. Vianne, the daughter of a gypsy and a wanderer herself, sets up her chocolate shop during the most austere of Christian seasons, Lent, thus infuriating the local priest who knows his parishioners will struggle with their Lenten vows. Vianne turns out to be a not-so-ordinary shopkeeper, and Reynaud the priest is not the holy man he pretends. As Vianne befriends the down-trodden, including a band of gypsies, her force in the village becomes as powerful as Reynaud feared.<br />With its tantalizing descriptions, this book will have readers dreaming of the finest chocolates and confections.  The language can be at times self-conscious and overblown, but the overall effect is mesmerizing, thanks to Harris's visual style and attention to detail.  The biggest flaw of this otherwise skilled first novel is the unsatisfying ending and the one-dimensional way Vianne connects emotionally with the gypsies.  These forced elements can be forgiven, however, given the moving lyricism of the rest.<br />CHOCOLAT is a beautiful but flawed work that offers much more than the average novel.  If you haven't already read this and are a fan of magic realism, you should pick it up.  You won't be disappointed.

The novel drags on and there is no definite path it takes...i am not sure what message the author was trying to send...the characters were not clearly etched...i thought it was about the struggles of an immigrant girl in london but all it did was ramble..i have to be careful to pick authors based on nominations for &quot;awards&quot;...
B00005JMJ4|3.0|This movie was highly anticipated, especially because it was so highly thought of during the Oscars. It is certainly one of the better movies of last year but I can also understand why some people might not have liked it.<br />I sometimes felt a little monotone, there are now downs or ups, which can be seen as a good or bad sign. The acting is funny and good and the American actors have done a good job acting in a way that they are completely out of place in the strange country that is Japan, this is the best of the movie in my view.<br />The story is very good, about two people lost in Japan, a country with a strange language. This is definitely one of Murray's best parts (next to the Royal Tannenbaums) but not as good as I expected. I think Sean Penn deservedly got the Oscar that year.<br />People interested in Japan should also watch, it's really funny what you see of Japan. Both the serene rest and the highly fluerescent lights of entertainment. <br />Music is also good.

0393325172|4.0|Fascination with the sea and the sea faring life made me buy this book.  A must have if this type of thing interests you.  O'Brian is a skilled writer although in some passages he over pwers you with the language at the time.  A credit to him because there were a few words I had to look up while enjoying this epic novel.  The book flows like a ship sweeping across a swift sea but I also found it to flouder at times.  Conversations between Aubrey and Maurtin were compelling.  Some of the best freindships can be found in respected colleagues with opposing points of view and O'Brian writes from the heart with both characters evenly.  The battle sequences are gripping and packed with vivid imagery.  Where I did encounter some difficulty is in the scope of the ship...characters weave in and out of the story and the author doesn't do much in reprising the character or their placement in the tale.  However, its a small complaint.  I heartily recomend this to anyone you enjoys a good tale about the sea and the people set on conquering it.  I will definitely continue to follow Lucky Jack and his travels.
6301763041|5.0|I thought that this film was great and fantastic for cheering you up. The songs were really catchy and cheesy (in a good way) and Johnny Depp looked incredible. A must for ALL fans.

B00006JIA4|5.0|The perfect collection to get introduced to Queen or have all their hits in one set. A fantastic buy, I couldn't love it more. Queen is AMAZING and always will be. They are truly the champions and one of the most underrated artists EVER!!! If there is one Queen collection to own, this is IT!
B00001SIES|3.0|This is a fine album but they do sound a lot like Radiohead!They have also been heavily influenced by The Smashing Pumpkins though the popular music press would have you believe they've been more influenced by Nirvana(typical of the prejudiced way the Pumpkins are treated compared to Nirvana in general).If it wasn't for the sometimes lack of originality,this album would be one of the great debuts of all time.They are outstandingly talented musicians though and Matt's a great vocalist.
B0001FR3IQ|3.0|Gothika starts off well and seems to be establishing a truly unique story, then quickly spirals downhill into a boring and cliched ghost story. I was unfortunately expecting something great, especially with the incredible Halle Barry in the lead, but was utterly disappointed in the outcome. It's worth a watch, but ultimtately ends up as unmemorable and unsatisfying. The ending is especially ridiculous.
0790743507|4.0|&quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot; is the definitive Hollywood musical, and charms and delights our 21st century audiences despite the (very few) characteristics of the genre that don't hold up quite so well.  <br />There are so many high points to this movie -- the amazing cast, the songs, the choreography, and, most surprisingly, the satirical send-up of Hollywood and the &quot;star system.&quot;  <br />The plot is well-known.  Silent film star couple, Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly, who also co-directed with Stanley Donen) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are America's sweethearts.  At a Hollywood premiere of their latest romance, breathless fans ignore sidekick Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor, in perhaps the best sidekick performance in film history) and scream in delight as Lockwood and Lamont pander to their adoration.  Nobody, however, seems to notice that the gorgeous Lamont never speaks . . . <br />Her imposed silence Lamont has a voice that recalls a cat with its tail caught in a wringer, although Lamont is such a &quot;dumb blonde&quot; (bless Hagen -- nobody ever played this stereotype better!) that she is blissfully unaware of her screech.  No matter, 'cause it's the silent film era, right?  Wrong!  Progress brings in &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; and the era of &quot;talkies.&quot;  No longer will clever staging of press events suffice.<br />Soon, Don Lockwood is staring career meltdown in the face as the first Lockwood-Lamont &quot;talkie&quot; sends the audience into hysterics.  Not only is Lamont's screech audibly offensive, they can't keep the sound synchronized to the film, and the sound editing even when in synch is as amateurish as a high-school film production.<br />What to do?  Fortunately, Lockwood had fallen for young, beautiful Kathy Selden (a teenage Debbie Reynolds), a starlet in the making.  Cosmo comes up with the idea of dubbing Selden's voice for Lamont's, and all is fixed . . . or not.  Lamont, an imbecile but smart enough to know her value, insists on ruining Selden's career to preserve her own . . . and so on and so forth.<br />The plot, ingenious as it is, is really secondary.  The main delight in this movie is the amazing dancin' and singin' that the performers offer up.  While most of it is pretty silly, campy stuff (particularly the Kelly-O'Connor set pieces), they simply dazzle.  Kelly is the most robust, athletic dancer of his generation, and O'Connor, well, the man doesn't have a bone in his body.  While the movie's most famous scene comes from Kelly splashing in puddles during the title track, the most amazing dance number has to be O'Connor's comic flailings in &quot;Make 'Em Laugh,&quot; where he runs up walls, flirts with a mannequin, and generally pulls out all stops.<br />Debbie Reynolds does a magnificent job keeping up with these two giants, and is generally a pleasure to watch, even though she's clearly outclassed as a hoofer.<br />While some great old films seem to get better with age (think &quot;Casablanca,&quot; &quot;Gone With the Wind,&quot; and &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;), &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot; is an American classic that does not hold up quite so well in some minor respects.  For example, when breaking into choreographed step, Kelly, O'Connor, and Reynolds sometimes appear too rigid, with smiles frozen on their faces, which is incongruous to those raised on more modern musicals like &quot;Moulin Rouge,&quot; where the dancers take a more naturalistic, emotional approach to their dancing. The dancing in &quot;Singin'&quot; holds up, but the performers were constrained by the expectations of their audiences, which somehow demanded that the performers &quot;look pleasant&quot; while dancing.  <br />Still, &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot; remains one of the best tonics to a foul mood ever . . . I defy you to watch this movie and not feel a smile creeping over your face.
6300214435|5.0|The opening is my favorite in all movies.  My next favorite is the opening for Men In Black.  I became a fan of Kate Capshaw when I saw her in this movie.  She shows three times the personality of the female leads in Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade. She made the movie a standout to me.  I enjoy Short Round too.  I believe that there is plenty of character development in this movie, and character development in a movie is extremely important to me.  I honestly don't understand some other reviewer's complaints.
0783235607|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock is definitely the most legendery film director of all time. His work is beyond amazing, without a doubt. Psycho is among the many greats of Alfred Hitchcock and will remain a classic.<br />    Starting off in Phoenix, Arizona on Friday, December 11th, 1960. The beautiful MARION CRANE (played by Janet Leigh) has rented a posh hotel room with her boyfriend, SAM LOOMIS (played by John Gavin), during her lunchbreak. Marion has to get back to work, while Sam has to get back to Fairvelle. Marion gets back to work a little late, but lucks out in knowing that her boss, GEORGE LOWERY (played by Vaughn Taylor) is late himself, for he is in a meeting. In comes George Lowery, following a businessman named, Tom Cassidy (played by Frank Albertson). He walks over to Marion and begins telling her about his 18-year old daughter tying the knot. He hands Marion $40,000, the money Mr. Cassidy will be using to buy his daughter a house as a wedding present. George invites Tom into his office and tells Marion to bank the $40,000 until the following Monday. Marion asks George for permission to take the rest of the day off because of her supposed headache and goes on her way.<br />    While in her bedroom, Marion packs a suitcase and changes clothes. She so temptingly stares at the $40,000 and tries to restrain herself, but not for long, for, in one quick movement, she steals the $40,000 and heads out to her car. Seems as though that Marion is on her way to Fairvelle to see Sam. While at a red light, she notices George crossing in front of her. Unfortunately, he notices Marion, but Marion, as worried as she is about having being noticed, continues on her way. She drives into dusk until pulling over to sleep. The next morning, Marion is awakened by a suspicious cop. She nervously talks to the cop and goes on her way, as the cop follows her. She pulls into a dealership and requests to trade in her car for another. She makes her decision rather quickly and pays for it with hercar, plus $700.<br />    She drives on her through the morning, afternoon, and into dusk. Suddenly, it's starts to storm. She gets off a main road and finds The Bates Motel sitting quietly off the highway as if it were hidden from it. She gets out and sees nobody in the office. She looks up and finds a sinister looking house and notices, through a window, an elderly woman walking about. She beeps her car horn until someone comes running out. He finally comes to Marion's aide and takes her inside. The man who took Marion inside the office is NORMAN BATES (played by Anthony Perkins), a seemingly-sweet young man, who owns both the house and motel. He checks Marion in to cabin No. 1 because 'it's closer in case you want anything'. Marion says she wants sleep more than anything, except maybe some food. Norman invites her to the house for some sandwiches. As he goes off to make the sandwiches, Marion hears a woman, viciously yelling at Norman. The woman is the elderly woman Marion saw and it turns out that the woman is Norman's mother. Norman yells back and comes back into Marion's room. The two have supper in Norman's polar, which is located in the back of the office. The polar is decorated with stuffed birds. Turns out that Norman's hobby is taxidermy. They have a brief conversation, leading to Marion wanting to get some sleep. She goes off into her cabin and gets ready to take a shower. She steps in and begins washing herself. While in the middle of her shower, the curtain opens to reveal a dark figure of an elderly woman. Marion turns around and screams in fright as she is murdered in cold blood. The woman disappears and Norman comes in to erase the crime.<br />    A week later, a young woman runs into Sam Loomis' store and demands to talk to Sam. Sam comes out and walks over to the young woman. The young woman is LILA CRANE (played by Vera Miles), Marion's curious sister. She tells Sam what Marion had done the Friday before. As Sam and Lila are talking about it, a private investigator by the name of MILTON ARBOGAST (played by Martin Balsam) comes in and begins talking to Sam and Lila about Marion. He goes off to investigate and comes across Norman and The Bates Motel. He questions Norman, but claims that Marion stayed overnight and left early the next morning. Arbogast then sees Norman's mother and asks to question her, but Norman refuses. Arbogast calls Lila and Sam, gives them the news and goes into the house to question Norman's mother, only to be killed by her.<br />    Lila and Sam have been waiting for Arbogast to return for three hours. Sam drives up there, but finds no Arbogast, but only Norman's mother. He drives back to Lila and they visit SHERIFF AL CHAMBERS (played by John McIntire). Al and his wife, ELIZA CHAMBERS listen to Lila and Sam's story of Marion's disappearance and of Arbogast's disappearance. Sam says that when he went up there, he too noticed Norman's mother. Both Al and Eliza make them aware of the death of Norman's mother that happened ten years earlier. Sam is certain of seeing Norman's mother in the house. The next morning, Lila and Sam drive up to the motel and decide to check in as man and wife, in order to search the motel. They are checked in by Norman. They settle in and begin searching Cabin No.1 and find that it was occupied by Marion. Sam tells Lila to take the job of questioning Mrs. Bates, while he distracts Norman. Lila enters Norman's fruitcellar, only to see that Mrs. Bates is dead, as the real killer is finally revealed. If you're wise, you'll take showers with the curtains open forever.
B000002KDO|5.0|Although Black Sabbath would later diversify their sound by experimentation, their first three albums were doomy, gloomy sludge metal of the early 70s. The latter of the three, Master of Reality, would set the standard for later metal through potency in riffs, lyrical content and sheer power. Some of their most memorable riffs like &quot;Sweet Leaf&quot; and &quot;Children of the Grave&quot; served up a couple of the hardest riffs of the 70s. This is truly Black Sabbath at their heaviest point musically but even more importantly, it secured their place in rock history. Perhaps even some of the first speed metal is heard in the closing song, &quot;Into the Void.&quot; Also, the song writing ability matures here greatly. &quot;After Forever&quot; assures you your not the religously alone person you might have thought you were and &quot;Sweet Leaf&quot; is about the pleasures of pot. Everyone shines on this album with their power. Geezer's bass becomes more in tune with Tony's distorted guitar while Bill drums with jazz influences. In the end, this is some of Sabbath's best and darkest work along with Paranoid, Vol. 4, and Sabotage. Check it out for sure.

B0001Z37HM|4.0|Red Sonja was Directed by Richard Fleischer(who also directed Conan the Destroyer). Admittedly, this was the worst film of the Conan style fantasy series, but it still has something to offer to loyal 80's fans. Excellent casting with the top action stars of the moment. This film has Arnold fresh off his Terminator hit, Brigitte Nielsen fresh off Rocky 4, and 80s karate star Ernie Reyes JR(star of the 80s TV series Sidekicks).<br />Red Sonja is fun, but it doesn't offer anything original. Just the same old save the world, good versus evil stuff.<br />If you couldn't get enough of the first 2 Conan movies and you need more, then pick up red Sonja. She isn't as pretty as Xena, but she and Arnold swing one hell of a sword! really excellent barbarian style sword fighting.<br />casting=4.5 stars<br />ending=4 stars<br />Directing and Editing=3.75 stars<br />plot &amp; storyline=2.5 stars<br />replay value=3.5 stars<br />OVERALL= 3.65 TOTAL STARS<br />DVD FEATURES: Red Sonja has a very nice wide screen transfer, chapter selection and movie trailer.<br />Sadly after a long wait for this DVD, we didn't get any commentary from the director or Brigitte. That's pretty sad that they don't try to give a little more quality to the fans after a long wait. Brigitte Nielsen hasn't done a good film since Beverly Hills cop 2 in 1987, so it's not like she is too occupied. The DVD special features are pathetic. At least give us some filmographies or something...
B00005JMJ4|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  It wasn't at all what I expected; it was different and unpredictable.  If you don't like &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot;-style movies then you probably won't like this one.  (Before you start flaming me...I'm not comparing this movie to &quot;Kramer&quot;; I'm simply saying that this movie falls into the &quot;depicts real life&quot; bucket as opposed to the &quot;fairytale&quot; bucket.)  <br />Lost in Translation makes good use of cinematography; there are many nuances that can only be realized by watching the subtleties of the images in a scene.  Personally, I enjoy a movie that requires a little thought and which requests that you at least halfway pay attention...rather than just spell everything out like I'm five years old.<br />I really enjoyed the music in the movie too!
0783225792|2.0|This is a great movie that deserves a better dvd treatment. The layout and features are extremely vanilla. Not since Dracula have I see such a vhs content type dvd. Maybe in the future it will get a proper treatment in a boxset but in its current condition this release shouldn't be purchased to accompany any collection.<br />Also its important to note that this is not the uncut version. So far the only uncut version of this classic to make it to dvd is the Australian release.

B00009Z576|5.0|A change: the coda to &quot;Does It Really Happen&quot; no longer comes with the quiet swell, but just starts right in at full volume. And what's with putting in those Paris session tracks yet leaving out the best one -- i.e., where's &quot;Tango&quot;?!?!? God help us, what more understanding is required of me today... And they put in a couple of sucky track-throughs but also leave out &quot;Flower Girl&quot; from those same sessions. The main album: Not a big improvement on the 1994 remmie but such a fantastic record all the same. Five stars in my eyes for it.

B000005Z0E|4.0|Tupac's road to domination in rap music started here, would you believe? And I'm not saying that to put down 2Pac but to give him props because I can feel what Tupac is saying in this record. His words are true but my man Nathan is right, this are pretty heavy lyrics and music which will offend those with the faint ears. Out of all the 2Pac albums, I have never heard 2Pac swear in so much songs so many times in an album but this.<BR>A.K.A. his first record, 2Pac was seen more as a gangsta in here. His words made people to believe that he was a menace to society that his music should be banned for the amount of swearing and violence he portrayed. But not even that could stop this album from being a great one: there were also good songs too. Whether it was from the story telling tale of a young girl who got pregnant (Brenda's Got a Baby, which just so happens to be a true story) to the pride in the black nation song (Words of Wisdom), 2Pac couldn't have done it better.<BR>Now 2Pac went through a lot of bad things in his life- grew up with no childhood friends, moved from place to place often, mother was in jail when he was born, mother was part of the Black Panthers, step-father was sentenced to prison etc. And I believe things just couldn't get any worse than what happened to 2Pac. This album kind of overlooks his past life and he takes out his anger on the world for what had happened to him. I Don't Give a F*ck is simply a negative song displaying his political side. In him, I could see a young Chuck-D. He has never been so anti-political in any of his records than 2Pacalypse Now. Crooked Ass Nigga (feat. 2Pac's true homeboy, Stretch) clearly states that he's a man with nothing to lose and Young Black Male writes out the pride of the black nation.<BR>What truly surprised me was Part Time Mutha, which is a record I think 2Pac should have released. His lyrical talent in this is exceptionally amazing but I wish I knew who the girl was. Her lines are true and strong. And the beat, oh my the beat. I reckon this is one of the best beats 2Pac has EVER come up with.<br />This is an album thats not to be taken lightly. Do not take him as a bad person just because of the things he said. He said it for a reason. 2Pacalypse Now, just another one of those who's AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted... Now that's the difference between a gangsta and a thug.
B00008EYA5|1.0|A waste of Colin Farell &amp; Samuel Jackson's talent.<BR>A lame action film with PG13 violence, PG13 gangstas and PG13 language. Unconvincing nonsense that marginally passes the time, with your diet coke and sweet popcorn!

0739313126|1.0|I'm glad some other people have had the same experience as me. When I first read all the reviews, I thought this might the book of the decade or something.<br />I'm not going to spend time debunking the facts vs. fiction or whether I believe any of what is stated in the book... smarter, more well-read people than myself have done so at great length. However, I am a writer, and so I'll base my opinion the quality of writing, storytelling, plot, foreshadowing, and the like.<br />I could forgive lack of character depth if the writing itself was tight (M. Crichton is the best at that), but its not. There were so many flashback's I often forgot where we were in the story. I still don't know anything about the characters even after finishing the book. Everything about them is told, nothing is shown. It's like being spoon fed pre-digested food; your brain never has to work at understanding them.<br />Part of the problem with writing about secret societies is, well, they're secret. So witholding information in a mystery-like fashion is a bit unecessary... since the vast majority of the readers wouldn't know the first thing about them.<br />Over all, the plot is interesting, but the story is abysmal. When they were on the plane and whats-his-face kept flashing back to his lectures, I actually decided I wasn't going to listen anymore. It was as if Mr. Brown had done all this research, put it in order, then tied it together with a couple of lame characters and then sent it to his editor. But I plodded on, hoping it would become better. I mean, come on, 80% of this book takes place either riding in cars or riding on planes... who would call that exciting?<br />Anyway, I'm probably being a bit over critical, but I've tried for years to break into the 'published' world, and I can tell you if you weren't Dan Brown and this was your first novel, they'd laugh you out of their offices.<br />oh well...
0676974562|5.0|I read a lot of fiction, and some of it is almost immediately forgotten, and some of it stays with me for awhile. This book is going to be in the back of my mind for a long, long time. There are three distinct sections, the first set in 1935 at a semi-stately family home in Surrey. Briony Tallis, from whose viewpoint we see things (and frequently misunderstand them), is thirteen and a precocious and overimaginative writer. Her sister, Cecilia, has just finished university and is sort of marking time while she waits for the next stage of her life to begin, whatever it might turn out to be. There's also a brother, Leon, only a couple years older than Cecilia, to whom she is very close. And then there's Cecilia's counterweight: Robbie Turner, the charlady's brilliant son, just down from Cambridge with a first-class degree and Mr. Tallis's assurance that his education will continue to be paid for. Robbie and Cee grew up together, but they're destined not to be pseudo-siblings, thanks to a broken heirloom vase and a fountain. But there are also the young cousins from an about-to-be-broken home, and a budding chocolate magnate visiting in the company of Leon, and what happens in the interval between one morning and the next will ruin two lives and cause radical change in several others. And Briony will be mostly to blame. This first act builds slowly and the characters reveal themselves bit by bit until you know them inside and out. The second section jumps ahead five years to the British army's retreat before the Germans in France and its convergence on Dunkirk. Robbie, a private soldier (because he has no choice), is stumbling through it himself in the company of two corporals and, even though you know what will happen in the larger picture, the suspense of wondering whether Robbie will make it out is excruciating. McEwan does an amazing job of recreating the insanity and chaos of that rout, seen close-up. What keeps him going is the thought of a return to prison and never seeing Cecilia again, and the reader can feel his agony clearly. In the third section, Briony, now eighteen, is a probationer nurse in a London hospital preparing to receive the army's thousands of wounded as they return across the Channel -- and again, McEwan's depiction of the girl's attempt to atone for the pain she has caused, her weariness both in body and in mind, is overwhelming. Even though you know what she has done, you can't help but feel sorry for her. Finally, in a brief coda set in 1999, Briony, now an elderly and accomplished author, has just finished the book we've been reading; it's her truthful account -- maybe -- of what actually happened that summer night in 1935. It's her final act of atonement. And she lets us know in only a few sentences that maybe the lovers weren't actually reunited as she has described. And that would be heartbreaking, but there often is no happy ending in a McEwan novel. Throughout the book, the authors -- both Ian McEwan and Briony Tallis -- weave a web of description and gradual understanding that keep the reader's attention riveted. Many times, I found myself rereading paragraphs aloud just to hear the shape of the prose. An outstanding piece of work.ver seeing Cecilia again, and the reader can feel his agony clearly.

0553381687|5.0|This book is so well written, Martin has a great way of getting the reader involved with so many different characters.  From the first page, I was hooked and could not put it down until I was finished.  I'm looking forward to reading the other books as soon as I find a free moment in my hectic life.<br />Here are some comparisons I have made:<br />(1) If you enjoyed the strategy, and manipulation of books like Shogun and The Godfather, then this book is for you.<br />(2) If you liked reading Lord of the Rings then this book is for you... keep in mind that this book is not &quot;orc and goblin&quot; fantasy, it's more knights, kings and queens, which for me is a plus!<br />Read this book... you won't regret it!

078322611X|1.0|Sports fans tend to be both nostalgiac and sentimental and sports movies tend to fall into the same trap.

B00008NRL8|5.0|I think it is one of the three records that redifine the concept of electrotango, like Bajo Fondo Tango Club and Tanghetto- Emigrante (electrotango). Santa Maria is a hit, Queremos paz is a great song, and all the songs in this record are incredible.
B000000OQF|5.0|Not that this album needs any customer reviews, but this is a rock'n'roll classic. One of the decades' best. And this &quot;American Rebel&quot; fella? Must be a fan of show tunes and window treatments. Go check out his (or her) other reviews: the Beatles' &quot;Abbey Road,&quot; Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot; and Zeppelin III all received one star from this turkey - even referred to McCartney and Lennon as overrated songwriters - while 5 stars were given to Kylie Minogue, Britney Spears, and Cher. So if you like that crap, then you might agree with American Rebel's review of this classic debut from the Guns. Go buy the soundtrack to &quot;Annie&quot; instead. All others please disregard the review, and all others from American &quot;Rebel&quot; and keep rockin'.
0385336810|2.0|I loved the Shopaholic books by Sophie and I am enjoying &quot;Can You Keep a Secret&quot; to some degree but, since I work as an Administrative Assistant, I find the book very condescending to those in my profession. No doubt she has a good sense of humor but if you work in my field you may find the book to be insulting.  I'm really tired of authors (and everyone else in the world) thinking that degrading Secretaries and Admin Assistants is a good subject for their writing.  I deal with enough condescension in my everyday life, I don't need to pick up a book which I'm expecting to enjoy and then have another person hit me in the face with insults.  I'm most likely done with this author because of this.
0345423496|5.0|A very unusual book for a sequel. 3001 is a very quick read and has some Arthur C. Clarke touch of 2001. Plus, the same character barely mentioned in the original is completely developed here, constructing him into the central character. In my opinion, this is the most underrated book of all time. There is no reason for the many negative ratings it has received. The very best new edition of this has recently been released, coming out as a well made but cheap paperback edition. <BR>     The story chronicles Frank Poole's revival and exploration of the new technology in the year 3001. After visiting the technology of the ship he is rescued by, he attempts to contact David Bowman by landing on Europa. I will not tell you anything that happens from here, as the rest is the most exciting part of the book. Pick this up AFTER you read 2001 and 2010.
B00005JMEW|5.0|This is one of Tarantino's best!!!!!!!!!!<br />This is the story of *bleep* AKA 'The Bride'. After the massacre at her wedding four years earlier in Texas, The Bride seeks revenge on her ex allies responsible for the murders of 9 innocent people in Texas, including her unborn child, or at least she thinks so.<br />She creates a 'Death List 5', a list containing all the people she has to kill: O-Ren, Vernita Green, Budd, Elle Driver and Bill.<br />The movie starts of with a bang -literally- as The Bride and Vernita Green have a knife fight, and ends in a blood bath.<br />In addition to the great acting, Tarantino managed to capture a 70's-like aspect to this flick, with the catchy and intense music, awesome special effects, humor, and setting.<br />If you loved 'Resivior Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction', you'll absolutley love 'KILL BILL Vol. 1'.
0451457994|5.0|Arthur C. Clarke's sensation, 2001, is a classic of our long century of books. This classic is very entertaining, and will keep the reader engrossed for a matter of hours. A very important book for everyone to discover. Each reader will close the book with a new understanding of space and humans. The sequels following this novel are inferior, (exception 2010), and do not have the Clarke touch and creative wit of the original. <BR>     So, the story starts with the dawn of humankind, when man apes discover a black monolith one morning. Eventually as we see, this started us on the road to technology. Millions of years later, Heywood Floyd discovers the same type of monolith on the moon. This one is known as the &quot;Tycho&quot; monolith. A mission to Saturn is eventually sent, to investigate strange noises coming down from Saturn to the monolith. The &quot;Discovery&quot; spacecraft carries Commander Dave Bawman, Frank Poole, and the infamous HAL 9000 supercomputor. The computor malfunctions and disaster strikes when an enormous monolith floating adjacent to Jupiter is discovered. I cannot tell you the ending. It is fantastic and will blow you away. <BR>     This novel is re released in a brand new, updated paperback with a foreward by the author. Discover the triumph of technology in this revolutionary piece.
0767903811|5.0|After reading and enjoying &quot;Notes From a Small Island,&quot; I was looking forward to Bryson's witticisms in regards to every day life in America.  Although an American, having spent twenty odd years in England gives Bryson a unique perspective on what makes America, and Americans, tick.  &quot;I'm a Stranger Here Myself&quot; is a collection of essays Bryson wrote for an English audience; but they lack none of their charm when read by an Anglophile American.<br />&quot;I'm a Stranger Here Myself&quot; is and odd conglomeration of essays that deal with a range of topics: small-town America, shopping, the inconvenience of our numerous &quot;conveniences&quot;, and several entries on his own ineptness when it comes to technology.  In each of his essays Bryson is a bit of a wanderer, starting in one direction, only to go off on a tangent.  Usually he's able to bring himself back to the point, and can even poke fun at himself for doing so.  His wanderings are what sets his style and what generates the largest laughs or head shakes of disbelief.<br />While Bryson is at times critical of what happens in America, &quot;I'm a Stranger Here Myself&quot; is a loving portrait of a revered country.  However, Bryson's perspective is one of a man living a blessed life.  He now resides in a virtually crime-free small New Hampshire town and grew up in small-town Iowa.  His essays sometimes lack the experiences that growing up or residing in other areas might offer.  However, due to his extensive travels, Bryson's perspective is truly unique and a joy to read.
0064407667|5.0|I just finished reading this book for the second time and am now almost halfway through the sequel.  I usually ignore crazes and fads in literature (yes, I'm afraid this also includes Harry Potter).  I just don't like getting sucked into something that everyone else and their dog are into.  But seeing THE BAD BEGINNING and its sequels on the shelves for so long started sparking my interest and curiosity primarily because when I first bought it, there was virtually no hype around it at all.  I never heard anyone talking about Lemony Snicket or any rave reviews or anything.  But now, with a new film soon to be released from Dreamworks (and starring Jim Carrey as the evil Count Olaf), more and more people are starting hear the name Lemony Snicket.<br />For someone who has just written ten New York Times bestsellers, one would not have thought that Daniel Handler (aka Lemony Snicket) would have started this literary endeavor with the attitude that he could never write a children's book \\"because children's books are such crap.\\"  But THE BAD BEGINNING is clearly a break from the norm in children's fiction, especially children's serial fiction.<br />The author does a wonderful job of throwing his wit into the mix of chaos and turmoil in the plot.  For instance, every now and again, he'll use a word which many children may not understand, but he'll explain it its context, saying, \\"...a word which here means...\\"  For example, on page 121: \\"But thanks to her adroit inventing skills - the word 'adroit' here means 'skillful' - everything worked the way it was supposed to work...\\"  And for humor, Sunny, the youngest of the three orphan siblings (and a mere infant), will often say things like \\"Hux,\\" \\"Gibbo,\\" \\"Jook,\\" and \\"Book!...she probably meant something like 'Would somebody please wipe my face?'\\" (80)<br />At one point in the story, the author even goes so far as to play with the reader's mind a little bit.  If you've ever found yourself falling asleep while reading (perhapsyou're even nodding off while reading my review - if so, shame on you!), then you'll recall that you may unconsciously read the same sentence over and over, because you can't remember if you had read that part before dozing off.  On page 94, Klaus (the young boy orphan) is staying up late one night reading:<br />\\"The book was long, and difficult to read, and Klaus became more and more tired as the night wore on.  Occasionally his eyes would close.  He found himself reading the same sentence over and over.  He found himself reading the same sentence over and over.  He found himself reading the same sentence over and over.\\"<br />Much of the wit and plays on words and grammar will make this book equally appealing to adults - a word which here means a physically and mentally mature person who is young at heart in terms of his or her literary choices - as much as the exciting story will appeal to kids.

0060090383|4.0|&quot;Rachel's Holiday&quot; is a very funny yet poignant novel by the Irish writer Marian Keyes. <br />Rachel is a bit of a lost soul in New York. She's living with her best friend who has a fabulous job yet she is just an assistant in a rundown hotel. She has a great boyfriend Luke who for some reason is just not cool enough for her. And she has a recreational drug habit which she thinks is no big deal...and her friends and family think is a big enough deal to send her away to a rehab in Ireland.<br />The novel chronicles Rachel's coming to terms with her drug problem--she is in deep denial at the beginning-and with the realities of her life. It is very, very funny in many parts. However, there are serious undertones. She thought that drugs would land her in the coolest circles in New York and not in a dingy rehab outside of Dublin.<br />I would recommend this book to chick lit fans everywhere--though they should note that this is chick lit with a serious message.
0790733226|5.0|One of my favorite subjects as I was growing up and into my early 20s, was backyard skywatching and astronomy.  I believe this movie accurately portrays the emotional aspects of science in general and astronomy in particular:  the sense of awe and beauty when confronted with infinity, and the sense of lonliness felt by everyone with an idealistic passion.<br />If you have ever read Carl Sagan's books, you'll see that this movie touches upon the usual staples of a Carl Sagan read:  the foundation of religion vs. the foundation of science, the mutual misunderstanding and struggle between those governed by curious optimism versus those governed by primal fear, and a demonstration of the dangers of a world that depends on science which is filled with so many people who do not understand it.<br />Some have argued that they find Contact to be &quot;preachy.&quot;  I don't really see much of a foundation in that assessment of the movie.  Just like in real life, the ultimate philosophical answers are left wide open at the end of this movie, leaving it open to many different interpretations.  And I think it's refreshing to see a movie that doesn't follow the contemporary pattern of avoiding any serious discussion about morality and philosophy.  These are some of the conversations the human race will be forced to have with itself if we want to survive the coming centuries.  Recent events since this movie was released and Carl Sagan's death only accentuate the importance of facing this fact.<br />I love this movie.  From the beautiful computer-generated opening sequence, through the middle sequences detailing the main character's relentless and passionate quest for scientific knowledge and exploration, to the adventurous surreal climax, I felt that I had a personal connection with almost every aspect of this movie.

6305169187|5.0|For me, this is an incredibly difficult movie to review and critique.  I feel that the movie did a phenomenal job of developing the story; however, the acting in the movie left something to be desired.<br />In case someone has not seen the movie, I do not want to give much of the story away.  An asteroid, classified as a global killer (a global killer meaning that if it impacts earth, there will be total destruction of life), is on a collision course with earth.  NASA comes up with the idea of landing on the asteroid, drilling a hole, and dropping a nuclear weapon in the hole and blowing up the asteroid with the intent of splitting it in two and altering its path so it misses earth.<br />While it is a simple story, the movie does an exceptional job developing the plot into a 2-hour movie.  The movie incorporates a \\"gloom and doom\\" plot with a second story of love, romance, and hope.  The first plot is about an oil driller and his band of misfits attempting to work with a group of highly educated astronauts and military pilots to drill a hole on the asteroid (and of course the work together as well as Worcestershire sauce and ice cream).  The second story line involves one of the oil drillers falling in love with the owners daughter.  The relationship reminds me of a terrible \\"teen-age\\" relationship with the seemingly perfect love that young people share coupled with a resentful father who seems to not want to lose his daughter.<br />It is difficult to explain how well the two story lines integrate without ruining the movie for someone who has not seen it.  While the plot is superb, the acting in the move is just so-so.  I thought the acting of the three headline actors (Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, and Liv Tyler) was weak at best; they had their great moments, but mostly their acting seemed almost emotionless.  I did think a couple of the lesser known actors (mainly Michael Clarke Duncan as \\"Bear\\" and Peter Stormare as the Russian astronaut) were incredible in this movie.<br />Personally, due to the overwhelming depressing plot about the end of the earth, I don't think this is a movie I would cuddle with on the couch with a new date.  However, I nonetheless think the plot is excellent  and I do highly recommend seeing this movie.  I give the movie 5 stars for how the movie integrates the two story lines together and develops them into a great plot, not the acting in the movie.vie.<br />Personally, due to the overwhelming depressing plot about the end of the earth, I don't think this is a movie I would cuddle with on the couch with a new date.

B0001AP12G|4.0|Kanye West, one of hip-hop's most talented producers, using his melodical beats to beautifully accent the voice of just about any rapper, finally debuts with &quot;The College Dropout&quot;, a strong album that creates mixed feelings.  I, personally, can't possibly give this CD less than four stars.  Kanye deserves every bit of fame he's earned.  The only thing that keeps me from giving this album five stars is the fact that Kany will one second rap about sending positive messages to the kids listening to his music, then turn around and spit the exact type of lyrics he criticises just a song ago.  Honestly, on an album that's so musically addictive and melody influenced, as well as lyrically strong, this point is kind of a 'nit pick', but I feel like picking on it, because Kanye isn't your normal rapper spitting about money, rides and girls.  Kanye is the type of person who's messages you can really get behind (listen to &quot;Jesus Walks&quot; or &quot;Never Let You Down&quot;).  Not only that, but Kanye seems passionate about spreading positive vibes in the industry.  The problem is, who's going to listen to a preacher teaching about the evils of drugs, who after the sermon goes into the back and smokes a blunt?  <br />Okay, the main negatives aside, &quot;The College Dropout&quot; is a very unique sounding record that frankly, I'm suprised made it into the mainstream.  I suppose with a backing rapper like Jay-Z behind you, even the most hard-core underground emcee could make it to the radio, but Kanye's flow is the type I normally associate with the higher quality type of rap that comes from hip-hop's underground CD.  Therefor, I honestly have to say &quot;Thank You Kanye!&quot; for finally infiltrating the system and bringing some variety to the radio.  This album is filled with different types of songs.  Head-nodders, heart-wrenchers, and (oddly enough) songs that will simply make you laugh.  Kanye has a talent for wordplay and clever, long winded verses that catch you off guard with his often choppy feeling flow that feels slightly reminiscent of Talib Kweli (my favorite MC of all time), so right there I'm destined to like Kanye West.  <br />The ironic trait of this album, is that even though I complain about Kanye's mixed messages, some of the most addictive songs on the record are the songs rapping about women and money.  Only, and I mean ONLY Kanye could pull of a song like that and make it fun for someone like me (who's complained about the industry's mindless messages for years).  The most noticeable song like this on the CD would have to be &quot;Breathe In, Breathe Out&quot; featuring Ludacris.  This song is truly the very definition of addictive.  The chorus alone runs through your mind long after the song is over.  Not only that but the wordplay on the song is hysterical!  I can't relay them here since I'd probably be banned from Amazon, so you'll just have to take my word for it.  My last bone to pick with this record would be the long skits and skit intros that make listening to the album all the way through irritating.  Oh well, it's all for the sake of fun, and I have to say, Kanye is truly a fun person (or so it seems).  I mean, come on, look at the cover of his CD.<br />SUMMARY<br />PRO'S<BR>*Great melodies/production<BR>*Clever and sometimes hysterical wordplay<BR>*More positive messages than negative messages<BR>*A few funny, parody skits<br />NEGATIVE'S<BR>*Mixed messages<BR>*Too many skits and skit-intros (they get annoying<br />Well, that's about all.  When all's said and done, the postives far outway the negatives, and I highly recommend this album.
0345440900|1.0|Tracy Hogg claims this is a middle of the road approach. It isn't. As a parent and as a licensed marriage and family therapist, I have read most of the parenting books on the market. This book isn't much different from all of the other sleep training books out there.     It is obvious it is written from the perspective of a babysitter rather than a medical doctor, psychologist, or experienced parent. Her change a \\"bad\\" habit in three days is ridiculous and oversimplified. Yes, you can change a behavior if you are ruthless enough about it, but that doesn't mean you should. Picking up the baby and putting them back down repeatedly as she recommends might make you feel like you are doing something rather than just leaving them there to cry, but you aren't meeting the babies need for closeness. In one example she explains that in one night she picked up and put a baby down 172 times (when he cried, she picked him up and as soon as he stopped she put him down), how frustrating for this poor baby who was trying to communicate a need that went unmet. After several days, the baby gave up and didn't cry in his crib anymore. She cites this as an example of how great her training program is. Babies are people with needs.     I met a family recently who used this approach and their baby responded to this program like a trained pup. She was complacent and passive. She slept through the night without a peep and from 8:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. Her daily routines involved videos, bottles, and crib-time with a bunch of pacifiers. No rocking, no lullabyes, definitely no nursing. It definitely was easy as her \\"E.A.S.Y.\\" program implies. But, this kind of approach has negative long term effects. The mother said that the approach is great because her child doesn't have to \\"waste energy communicating her needs\\" because they tell her what she needs. This is a big premise of this book. I found this very sad.     Children need to learn to identify their needs, communicate their needs, and havethose needs met. In this process they learn to communicate and have healthy trusting relationships with others. These sleep training programs are based on behavioral psychological theories. The problem with this is that these approaches are more appropriate for animals, which is how these theories developed. But it is completely developmentally inappropriate to use these behavior modification approaches with human infants. The first 12 to 18 months of life the primary task of a human infant is to learn to trust.     This author really does not understand child development at all, one of her main points is \\"start as you mean to go on\\" and she explains how you shouldn't start doing something that you don't want to continue. It doesn't work like this. Young children are needy and as those needs are met, they become less needy. There is a classic study by Ainsworth that showed that young infants whose cries were responded to promptly cried less as older infants, whereas young infants whose cries were ignored or responded to inappropriately or wiht delay cried more when they were older. Books like this make the routine more important than the relationship. This causes significant long term relationship problems that the child will struggle with in the years to come. I see this every day in my practice-problems with intimacy and materialism, attaching and finding comfort in objects continuing later in life- the bottle, pacifier, and blankie become the cigarette, the alcoholic drink, the compulsive shopping, the compulsive eating, etc tomorrow. Of course the occasional use of a pacifier or bottle when mom isn't available is handy, but overrelying on mother substitutes as Tracy recommends is not good for your child.     One of the best pieces of advice I can give is teach your child to love people and use things, and not the other way around. This book promotes loving things and using people. The approach is very manipulative. If you want to learn more about child development, go right to the source and study Winnicott, Kohut and Bowlby. Or if you want to read a book marketed to parents read \\"The Baby Book\\" or \\"No Cry Sleep Solution\\" or \\"Good Nights\\".

0345440900|1.0|I was disappointed with this book. Tracy Hogg is writing from the perspective of a nanny and that is apparant in her approach. It doesn't really discuss the relationship between parent and child. It focuses on a daily schedule of eating, activity, sleeping, and you time. I was offended by her opinions and attitudes about breastfeeding. If you are a stay at home mom who breastfeeds this book is definitely not for you. Perhaps if you are working full-time and need to have a scheduled baby and plan to bottle feed, then this book might fit your needs. Tracy's section on breastfeeding focuses on the downsides of breastfeeding making comments like \\"if you have body image issues, you shouldn't breastfeed, it will make your breasts sag\\" and \\"if you breastfeed past age one, you are doing it for yourself, not your baby\\". I find these comments interesting because the American Academy of Pediatrics has officially put out a recommendation that all babies be breastfeed for a minimum of one year and to continue breastfeeding for as long as is mutually beneficial. The former surgeon general has stated that all babies benefit from breastfeeding for at least one year and it is the lucky baby who gets to breastfeed until age 2. The world health organization has recommended breastfeeding until at least age two. These recommendations are based in the physical, emotional, and psychological benefits of breastfeeding. Tracy definitely minimizes the importance of breastfeeding in this book. Also, she minimizes sleep difficulties a baby may have and stresses that all babies must learn to fall asleep by themselves. However, at the same time she really advises using a pacifier and letting babies suck on the pacifier while falling asleep, I don't see how this is any different from nursing to sleep, which she strongly advises not to do,but she pushes bottles, pacifiers, and thumb sucking. I guess coming from a nanny's perspective these would be your primary tools in baby care.
B000002J0B|5.0|I was initially disappointed when I first listened to this album. It was softer and more acoustic than Zoso or Led Zeppelin II. But after listening to it a few more times, it drew me in and I realized what a stroke of genius it was. It has a little bit of everything, so much so that it seems to be a compilation album. Let me explain.<br />1. The Song Remains The Same:<BR>  It took a lot for me to like this song. But it kind of grows on you after a few listens. Robert Plant's vocals are freakin' amazing on this song, going way higher than any woman I know can sing.<br />2. The Rain Song:<BR>  This is the one song on the album that just doesn't work for me. It drags on for way too long, with nothing but strings and some sparse acoustic guitar.<br />3. Over The Hills And Far Away:<BR>  One of my favorites. A nice acoustic start before kicking into high gear in a big way. Nice lyrics, also.<br />4. The Crunge:<BR> This is another one of those songs that you have to listen to a lot before you really like it. But, I'm starting to. It's really funky and fast, with some nice vocal work. I always laugh at the end when Robert Plant says &quot;Where's that confounded bridge?&quot; <br />5. Dancing Days:<BR> One of the best songs. A loud, raucous rocker with a killer chorus that I always get stuck in my head.<br />6. D'yer M'aker:<BR>  Ok, I'm sure everyone's heard this one. It really needs no explanation. Great song though, excellent drumwork from John Bonham.<br />7. No Quarter: <BR>  One of my all time favorite Led Zep songs. It's very psychedelic with an irresistably seductive guitar riff. It's odd, but it doesn't sound like it belongs on this record.<br />8. The Ocean:<BR>   Another loud rocker, and another one of my favorite Led Zep songs. I paticularly love the upbeat ending, it sounds rather jazzy to me. <br />   In conclusion, this CD may take a couple of listens before you truly appreciate it, but it's worth your time and your money.

B000000W5P|5.0|What is it about 'Some Girls' that's so special? It's easy enough to understand - after what critics and casual fans refer to as a &quot;slump&quot; from 1973-1977, this album revitalized general interest in the Stones. 'Some Girls' mixed disco, rock and country together to create a tough new sound.<br />The songs transition into each other very easily, thus picking a few favorites or high points is extremely difficult. 'Beast of Burden' is a shining example of Mick's mastery of the ballad. 'Miss You' captures the energy of disco music, but resists sounding dated. <br />'Some Girls' fused the experimental spirit of 'Black &amp; Blue' with the classic rock fundamentals of 'It's Only Rock &amp; Roll' and charged it with the energy from their 'Love You Live' 1977 release. After exploring different styles, the Stones were ready to focus and refine their sound. 'Some Girls' will please both casual and die-hard fans alike.

B0000C0FJB|5.0|I own the CD version of this and my dad owns the DVD, and I compared my CD to the DVD of his. Now, IMHO the CD is a better buy, because the 5.1 sound on the DVD is absoultely horrible especially considering that my dad's surround sound setup has the 2 rear speakers on each side of the chairs, and all you can hear in the rear is the crowd. It is very annoying, and we were so annoyed that we had to switch it over to stereo to stop from hearing the sound. The stereo sounded a little better, but if you want to hear it in stereo I suggest you go out and buy the CD. But it all will depend on your love of Rush. My dad and I both love Rush, so we were disappointed. I haven't tried the DVD on my setup, which is slightly different, but I might get the same effect. Buy either of these, just heed my warning. Pray to God, that your setup is good!

B00028HBKM|5.0|This film is so awesome that you're not bothered by the constant Aramaic language and subtitles. You don't even notice it after a while. Mel Gibson has proven himself as a director. The colors, shots and mixture of beautiful miracles w/ the excruciating Passion scenes are wonderful. In addition, the acting in this film is excellent. I was speechless after seeing this film. It really causes one to question his/her own lifestyle. I'm so thankful Mel Gibson undertook this faith endeavor. This movie will be a classic and unforgettable part of both Hollywood, American society and the Christian community. God bless Mel Gibson!<br />PS. This movie is definitely not for the weak stomach or children. Even as a Christian, I question the wisdom in exposing any child to the graphic images of the cruxifiction reenactment.
B0001CCXY8|5.0|I've been a fan of Cannibal Corpse since the Tomb of the Mutilated days and I can honestly say that each album they have released has been better than the last. This band is just a TRUE crushing Technical Death/Speedmetal machine. Listen to the 6th track Cyanide Assassin. This is some of best technical Deathmetal I have ever heard. Frantic Disembowlment, Rotted Body Lanslide, hell all of them kick major ass. Cannibal Corpse have proven to the world that a band can get better over time. This album is most definitely the best music they have ever written. Seriously! They have lived through the decade of the 90s when many other bands have fallen apart musically or dissolved. They make other Deathmetal bands look like amateur high school bands.<BR>Buy this or DIE

B000005DQR|5.0|From the opening sample of &quot;Building Steam With a Grain of Salt&quot; where a voice is heard saying &quot;Producing...&quot; you know you are listening to an outstanding piece of work. In order to better understand this, you have to position yourself at the time this album came out.<br />You have to realize Trip Hop was already in full fledge: Massive Attack and Portishead had already come out with their own thing, but DJ Shadow came with a different proposal in 1996 when he produced 'Endtroducing...'. Through the magic of samples, he blended in a way many have tried to copy, yet no one yet matched, genres such as rock, soul, funk, ambient, and jazz, into a final product that transcends time. If you need further proof of that, think how long it's been since this album came out (1996) as you are reading this, sit back, listen to it and be amazed, as so many have been amazed to this day.<br />After listening to 'Endtroducing...' almost daily for three weeks now, turning back and thinking of acts such as Fatboy Slim almost feels awkward, considering his sample-based 'Better Living Through Chemistry' came out almost a full year after Shadow's debut. Granted that everyone has a place in music, DJ Shadow's genius with sampling work simply is above and beyond, making this not only his breakthrough, but also one of the best albums ever.<br />Other favorite tracks: &quot;Changeling&quot;, &quot;Untitled&quot; and the grandieuse &quot;Mutual Slump&quot;. If you want to take a dip into an evolved form of his work, check out his side project, U.N.K.L.E., in particular 'Psyence Fiction'.
0393317552|5.0|I read this book purely for pleasure, unlike a lot of people I know who have read it for class or as part of an academic exercise. I simply like to pick a book that will challenge me in between fiction books. This book did not disappoint. <br />This is a rare work in that it can appeal to academics and pleasure readers. The knowledge and research behind the concepts in the book are complex and detailed, but Diamond does such an excellent job of explaining things, that you can easily sometimes forget the vast amount of information that he had to assimilate in order to put forth this hypothesis. <br />There are also two main points from the book that I took. One is the merely academic and scientific data that you learn from the book. I do not have a science, anthropologic, or linguistic background, so I learned a great deal from this book. But secondly, there is a very clear goal of this book to discount the foundations of racism. This is a lesson that every reader from this book can take with them and actually use in real life. I was struck at how this book can have such a dual purpose, and this makes it truly unique in my opinion. <br />Sure, there are vast generalizations that are made in a work such as this, just as there are in any history book, but this book has excellent points, is well researched, and makes solid arguments. I would definitely read another book by Jared Diamond and will definitely not forget the lessons I learned in this book.

The theory might still make sense if it was the filmmakers (possibly with King's involvement) who decided to make the wife-death plot change and Shining allusions harmonious with the plagiarism theme.<br />Excellent movie!<br />Some people are annoyed that this movie has the same plot twist as Fight Club.  BUT Fight Club the book came out in '96 and Stephen King's story \\"Secret Window Secret Garden\\" came out, I believe, in '91 or '92.<br />So the question is, who plagiarized who ;)<br />Of course you all get the smiley face.  This movie is about plagiarism, among other things.<br />Notice how much this movie resembles \\"The Shining\\", especially that scene at the end where Mort's wife walks in to the cabin and sees \\"Shooter\\" and \\"Shoot Her\\" all over the walls.  That scene is shot in the exact same choppy way that Kubrick filmed the analagous scenes in The Shining.<br />Well, it makes me think... the key difference between this movie and The Shining is that in this movie, the crazy husband SUCCEEDS in killing his wife.<br />So I wonder... back then in the late 80s, early 90s, there's Stephen King realizing that he's beginning to plagiarize himself.  So he thinks to himself... \\"I wrote The Shining.  But at the end I copped out and let the wife live.  I really... wanted to... KILL HER!  Hmm... I should fix my ending and put the ending I actually, secretly wanted in the book\\"<br />So King realizes this and writes a tragic in-joke of a novella about a writer who has to \\"fix the ending\\" of a story that he plagiarized from himself, but then copped out from because of cowardice.<br />Brilliant!<br />Of course it's just a conjecture (thanks to Lisa for helping me work it out).  But I find it a fascinating possibility, and it makes the movie 10 times better for me.<br />And wow, Johnny Depp!  I've never seen any actor get so well inside the skin of a neurotic, depressed artist who's falling apart--from the endless napping to the battles with the pack of cigarettes to the nervous twiches and cowardice and obsessive replaying of a spouse's infidelity.<br />The exploration of a man's cowardly inability to cope with his own obsessive vengefulness enters a territory movies rarely plumb.<br />Another thing--I've never seen any movie blend comedy and horror so well.<br />5+ stars.
B00000AF98|5.0|This album has everything a KISS album should have:hard rock anthems, fast-fingured guitar solos, explosive lyrics, heart-felt power balads and the fun spirit of KISS. If I were to recommend a KISS album to anyone it would be this one simply because its just a really fun album that has something for metal fans as well as ballad loving folks. Songs like &quot;I'll Fight Hell to Hold You&quot;, &quot;No,No,No&quot;, &quot;Hell or High Water&quot; and &quot;Turn on the Night&quot; all contain some of the best guitar work I've heard on a rock album and show that the band still had the same great sound after over 14 years of making music. If you're into depressing, boring and pompous Seattle garage drivel steer clear of this one, but if like high adrenaline, guitar-driven fun metal then this is a must have for your collection. Forget what some pompous self-rightous critic who listens to whatever they hear on corporate radio or M TV tells you, this is a great C.D. and if you like KISS, you'll love this album.
B00008H2LB|2.0|Linkin Park is a good band but extremly easy to get sick of. I probaly would of given this Cd a 5 star review a year ago when the Cd came out but now a  year has passes and am deathly sick of MTV playing it over and over, people going on and on about it, and all this. Hybrid Theory was better. It took me by suprise. And I can still occasionly put it in. I can't put this CD in at all. It's too short for starters. YOu can't write a rap-core cd and only have it be 32 min long. not only that, they are more techno. When I listen to rap-core band I don't wanna hear all these sound affects, they sound like a robot. Rap-core should be in your face energy, but with soothing melodies, and blood curling screams. You want a good rap-core band. Listen to Limp Bizkit. They kick these guys ass rock-wise. Get three dollar bill by Limp bizkit and Significant Other, and Chocolate Starfish, don't get the new CD. It sucks. Fred does all of it himself. He doesn't need an extra singer to help him. The other thing I don't like about these guys is, all songs sound the same. It starts off with energy, with rapping or singing, get into the middle of the song and has a chorus, than at the end it gets really heavy, and chester screams his head off. And that part always sounds the same. Their gatar isn't very complex either. Limp is so much better. Have a good day!
B0002IQNAG|5.0|I must be honest, I almost got tricked into buying the DiviMax edition aswell, but after taking a look at what features it had on it and hearing rumours about this four-disc edition, I decided not to bother. All in all by looking at the cover art and reading about what will be on it, I believe that this edition will be a great buy for the month of September and for any Dead fan out there and, hopefully it will be the last edition for this particular movie. I can just see it now, six months from now, brand new \\"SIX DISC\\" Special Edition, that would be quite a sight .
B0001UL7RY|5.0|When her first album, Let Go, was released -- it took the world by storm, in both positive and negative ways. I chose the positive path, because personally, I thought she was pretty, genuine, and of course, talented. So she thinks she's &quot;punk&quot;. So what, let her think of herself how ever she wants to; that shouldn't interfere with how people think of her singing career, but instead, merely the opinion of her appearance/image. (It's like.. these days, it's TRENDY to bash and hate music artists, whether they're 'good' or not. Wtf? Why can't people respect that we all have different tastes in music and that we, and/or our musicians, shouldn't be judged for that?) Angsty Avril has definitely blossomed in her second album, Under My Skin. Her songwriting skills have skyrocketed, revealing raw emotion as she lets us peek into her soul. Hate her image if you will but think of this, if she supposedly sucks so bad, why does she have a record deal, with two albums? She has talent, that's why. I love every song on this album, but my three top favorites are: Together, Forgotten, and Slipped Away (a tribute to her late grandfather). I highly recommend this album if, 1) You liked her first album.  2) Are in the mood for some infectious, angsty pop with a few tearjerkers in the mix. One more thing. Avril doesn't necessarily target teenagers. There are many adult Avril fans, including myself. (I'm 23.) In conclusion, you should absolutely buy or borrow this album and give it a chance before you bash. Sure, the lyrics are clichd, but then again, it seems like everything else in this world is as well.
B0001EKZOQ|4.0|2 Bad Cigala sings . Otherwise is Perfect .
B0001LJC2K|2.0|Yes, I'm not gonna deny that the singer has a great voice. And the band plays very well. But I also liked them back in 1993 when they were called RADIOHEAD!<br />Come on guys, be a little original! Don't waste that voice trying to imitate someone! Do your own thing, I'm usre it'll work out fine.<br />I'm giving them an extra star because of their ability, but I'm feeling VERY generous!
0553103547|5.0|Before reading A Game of Thrones in late 1999, I had nearly given up on fantasy. I?m quite certain that there were authors writing good high/heroic fantasy, but I wasn?t coming across them, and the authors that regularly cracked the New York Times bestseller list (Brooks, Salvatore, Eddings) were neither good nor original. I saw Robert Jordan?s comment on the cover of the book - ?It?s Brilliant? - and decided to give it a shot. Even though Jordan?s own work had been falling off, and continues to fall off as if he is just throwing paper off a cliff, he had written some remarkable fantasy earlier in the decade. More than that, I had met him in person once, and he didn?t seem the type to congratulate others unless such commendation was merited.<br />I sped through A Game of Thrones as if it were a two hundred page children?s novel. There is so much strength here, so much which is missing in most fantasy today. The characters are not only alive and believable, but they interact in ways that surprise us. The writing isn?t only immediate and perfectly crafted to move the story along at breakneck speed ? it is GOOD writing! That is a rare combination indeed, irrespective of genre.<br />Martin had me hooked early on ? in the Prologue, in fact. Orson Scott Card wrote that he never saw a Prologue that added anything to the story, and therefore thought they were unnecessary. Given some of the prologues I?ve read, I would tend to agree with him. But this is the exception that proves the rule. Because this is such an atypical fantasy (in stark contrast to Jordan, there is very little magic), that Martin needed to introduce some of the fantastic elements right away, needed to demonstrate that in his world there was something akin to evil.<br />But what *really* hooked me was the scene between Jon Snow,(...) son of Ned Stark, and Lady Stark, who *very* grudgingly accepted Jon?s presence in their home, Winterfell. Martin, talented writer that he is, led me by the nose, expecting one outcome, but gave me another entirely.<br />It was at that moment that I knew this book was going to be full of surprises. And it is.<br />Martin takes risks. He takes risks that very few writers would be brave enough to take. What those risks are, I can?t divulge. I?ll just say that at two key junctures in the book, when I thought for certain that typical fantasy elements would arise and the day would be saved, something entirely unlooked for occurred. I know that what I?m referencing is no longer a well kept secret, but still, I don?t want to be responsible for spoiling it for a new reader coming to this work.<br />As I said, this is atypical fantasy. Although Martin bears the R.R. initials, and although he holds Tolkien in the highest regard, he did not succumb to what so many authors did before him and write a Tolkien retread. This is simply the freshest, most original fantasy to come along in well over a decade. If one were to draw comparisons, and that?s not something I like to do with good authors (I?ll gladly compare Goodkind and Brooks), I would say that Martin has more in common with Sharon Kay Penman (who is the best writer of medieval historical fiction alive) and Alison Weir (one of the prominent medieval historians, capable of making ?dull? history exciting and tangible) than he does with anyone writing in the fantasy genre. And that?s high praise indeed.e outcome, but gave me another entirely.<br />It was at that moment that I knew this book was going to be full of surprises. And it is.<br />Martin takes risks.

B000059Z8J|4.0|I like Superman: The Movie. But I wasn't that impressed by the extra 8 minutes. I like the vagueness of less Brando and less explanation for him being here. I hear they may make Superman II on dvd a &quot;Special Edition&quot; and alter things around. That will be a real travesty if they do because it seems like the Director's Cut is the only form movie companies want to promote these days. And that undercuts the fact that on its own, in original form, the public fell in love with THAT version. The movie's heart and strong script still make it a success though.
B00005QCYC|4.0|I only have three things to say. <br />1. Jurassic park, came out early 90's: excellent, even though it's older the special effects were good<br />2. The lost world, late 90's: personally my favorite of all three.<br />3. J.P. \\\ ( like the slash marks), 2003, THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST OF THE THREE ( in my opinion) It's to short, to quick and corny. Plus the endy sucks. <br />take my advice and either stear clear of the third one or buy this for the first two.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Awesome awesome awesome!!  I love this album so so much!  All the cast members fit their roles perfectly--which is, I suppose, why they were cast--and do an excellent job of portraying this twisted fairy tale.  The true musical theatre junkie will eat this up--even those of you who wouldn't know whether a show is good or bad must love this album!  If you don't have one, GET ONE!!  Singers, keep your eyes peeled for the vocal score too.  I can't wait!
B00005JM0B|1.0|As the title says, they should have stopped after the second movie. I loved the first two movies, but this one was just a poor attempt to make more money off of the Terminator name. Written mainly around the special efects, there was little to the story and little to like about this movie. I actually found myself hoping that the main characters would die, just so I wouldn't have to ever sit through another Terminator movie. Please don't make a Terminattor 4.
B00005UKKF|5.0|This is THE BEST CONCERT OF ALL TIME!!!! she puts on the best show.. you don't need to be a britney fan to appreciate this spectacle! Its got fireworks, rain, fire, lights an amzing HUGE stage setup. the costumes are amazing, the dancing is WOW!!! This shows what britney is best at she is a born entertainer! What i also loved about it was that she remixed her older songs such as baby one more time, oops i did it again and made them much more enjoyable and they WENT OFF!!!! She has lots of energy and LOOKS HOT!! Her choreography is incredible and shows you what britney is really about!! Also inbetween the songs she has the background dancers dance along to club music which also adds to the energy of the show!!! <br />I STRONGLY RECOMMEND this DVD to anyone who wants an uptempo, high energy, highly produced concert to watch. It is a MUST HAVE!!!!
B000003S0P|5.0|King Crimson are without a doubt one of the most important prog bands in history.  They were one of the originators of the genre, and unlike many of their peers, they continue to not only make great music today, but to push the boundaries of progressive music.  They've made a lot of great music over the years, but &quot;Red&quot; is one of the most revered albums of their career.  And it's easy to see why.<br />&quot;Red&quot; was an extremely groundbreaking record of the time.  While a lot of prog bands in the 70's were doing more light-hearted and upbeat music awash in oodles of keyboards, Crimson made an album that was contrastingly dark, sinister, and heavy, and with very sparse use of keyboards.  Needless to say, it stood out from the herd.  Even as compared to their previous material, this was a very dark and menacing piece of music.  However, it is certainly not without an element of beauty, as there are plenty of awe-inspiring melodies here as well.<br />The title track fires out of the gate, with its powerful and addictive riff.  It's a very loud and hard-hitting track, but still maintains a very dark and spooky atmosphere (particularly the middle section).  From there, the album moves into much softer territory, with the soothing ballad &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;.  Very nice guitar melodies, and excellent vocals.  &quot;One More Red Nightmare&quot; gets things going again, with a very bouncy and catchy groove, combined with some wacked-out jazzy instrumentation.  &quot;Providence&quot; is an amazing improv jam, with killer use of violin and saxophone to counter-balance Fripp's insane guitar work.  The album reaches its pinnacle with the huge epic &quot;Starless&quot;.  This song is the perfect definition of buildup in music.  Beginning with sort of a peaceful Frank Sinatra vibe, the song slowly crescendoes into a monstrous jam that will leave you breathless, and sufficiently battered.  This is quite simply a song you must hear to believe.  Not to mention that John Wetton's vocal performance on this song is among the most powerful I've ever heard.<br />I realize I haven't really said anything in this review that a lot of other people haven't already said before, but that's ok.  The more people spreading the greatness of this album, the better.  Buy it now.  You will never be the same.t John Wetton's vocal performance on this song is among the most powerful I've ever heard.  <br />I realize I haven't really said anything in this review that a lot of other people haven't already said before, but that's ok.

B000059XUI|5.0|All you people complaining about what is and should have been (Donner not being able to complete the project) the end result is a movie that many people view as better! Leave my Superman II alone!
B0001AP12G|5.0|This is exactly what everyone else is saying. One of the best to come out. Kanye knows how to produce beats and create well developed hip hop. Fav tracks on here are All falls down, Jesus walks, spaceship, and Never let me down with an apperance from Jay-Z. This is a hot c and i recommend it to those who love hip hop and hot tracks. Anyone who says that Kanye is &quot;off&quot; doesnt really know what they are talking about. And the proof is on the cd.
B000075BFK|5.0|I say modern day because he has alot of guest rappers and producers that are popular today.  As far as guest features, they include Nas, Anthony Hamilton, Trick Daddy, T.I., Mya, and of course The Outlawz.  The biggest producer on this album is probably Jazze Pha.  Here's the listings of my favorite songs:<br />&quot;When We Ride On Our Enemies&quot;- This song mainly goes at Mobb Deep, Da Brat, and The Fugees.  Amazing beat and hard, brutal lyrics by Pac.  Two verses of greatness.<br />&quot;My Block&quot;- An acoustic classic from 2Pac.  Four verses with great storytelling.<br />&quot;Thugz Mansion&quot;(Acoustic)- Everyone complains about Nas being on this track(they were beefing before he died), but The Outlawz said in an interview that Pac squashed the beef before his death.  Great song.<br />&quot;Thugz Mansion&quot;- This is the second version of the song.  Tight three verses from Pac and an excellant chorus by Anthony Hamilton.<br />&quot;Fame&quot;- A catchy, classic chorus.  The only con of this song is that I think The Outlawz shouldn't have been on this particular song.  <br />&quot;Ghetto Star&quot;- I like the beat and the verses.  The guest rapper(Nutso) is a pretty good rapper.  <br />&quot;Mama's Just A Little Girl&quot;- Sounds like a part 2 of Brenda's Got A Baby.  It's one of the best songs on the album in my opinion.<br />&quot;Catchin Feelings&quot;- A cool, fast-paced, song featuring The Outlawz.<br />&quot;Changed Man&quot;- The only party song I really like on the album.  T.I. guest raps.  <br />&quot;Late Night&quot;- Like the guy says at the beginning, it's a smooth song to smoke to.  Nice beat.<br />&quot;They Don't Give A F*ck About Us&quot;- A very powerful hook, with tight verses.<br />&quot;Who Do You Believe In&quot;- I call it the song from the grave, because the guest rapper on it is Kadafi, a member of The Outlawz who was also murdered.  It's a cool song about faith and religion.<br />Now these aren't the only good songs on this album, none of them are completely bad.  This is one of my favorite records and I can't wait till the next album's released.<br />P.S.- Don't shut off the cd after the last track, because there's a secret outro with Pac saying he's gonna return like Jesus.<br />Was this review helpful to you?
B0001Z53AQ|4.0|Before I got this cd, I was expecting this to be one of the best cd's so far this year with all the hype behind it.  When I picked it up and I heard the first 2 songs I thought it was gonna be but from there it went downhill even though the end does save it.  Here is my rating of this cd, all scores out of 5.<br />1.Git Up-great intro it gets u into the cd, 5<BR>2.Loyalty-I knew Obie or 50 would have to be on this cd but this is a great appearance, 5<BR>3.Just Like U-weird weird song dont really like it, 2.5<BR>4.I'll Be Damned-alrite, 3<BR>5.Dude(skit)<BR>6.My Band-loved it at first cant really stand it now, still gets a 4 though<BR>7.U R The One-an ok song i guess, 3.5<BR>8.6 In The Morning-pretty good, 4<BR>9.How Come-the current single its gonna get soo played out like my band but its good now-4.5<BR>10.Leave That Boy Alone-another ok song,3.5<BR>11.Get My Gun-a funny song, 4.5<BR>12.Bizzare(skit)<BR>13.Bitch-Hillarious song I love it,5.5!<BR>14.Steve's Coffee House(skit)<BR>15.D-12 World-ok i expected more being a Kanye beat, 3<BR>16.40 Oz.-My favorite song on the whole cd i love this song eminem's verse is just amazing-6!<BR>17.Commerical Break-half skit half introduction to new rapper like the song on Devil's Night where we first met Obie<BR>18.American Psycho II-another great song featuring Cyrpress Hill makes it even better, 5.5<BR>19.Bugz 97(skit)-I wouldnt say this was all a skit since Bugz is rapping in it so i'll give it a 4<BR>20.Good Die Young-a great song mourning of their old member Bugz, 4.5<br />21.Keep Talkin-bonus song dissing ja rule off of one of their mixtapes pretty good, 3.5
B00004T9UF|5.0|This album is great. I'm white, but it doesn't make me a &quot;whigger&quot; to listen to this bumpin' cd. Some people just take music too literal [serious] and actually DO what these rappers joke about. Some people are too stupid to understand what is right, and what is wrong. Em' is a comedian no matter how much he denies it. This album is his best although twisted and not for the easily-offended. It's NOT a freestlye session. And many people can rap &quot;better&quot; but not as &quot;sinister&quot; as Eminem and Slim Shady[his sick side]. So if you take things too seriously, or don't like twisted rap, don't buy it. Otherwise 5 outta' 5!
0316168815|4.0|I must admit I did not like the begining of the book, Susie telling the story from heaven. However, this book is so powerful and enticing I could not put it down. <BR>Susie is murdered and she watches from heaven how her family and friends cope with her death. She watches them and her killer trying to make sense from her murder. The book is about love, friendship, family bonds and tragedy. <BR>It did creep me out a little thinking that the dead are up in heaven watching every move that the living make, but overall I enjoyed this book tremendously.
0767836324|5.0|For a movie going on lucky 13 years old, it's still as fun to watch as it was the first time I saw it in the theaters. Peter Banning is a well off American lawyer married to the great grandaughter of Wendy Moira Angela Darling...Mora Darling. He also has two kids, Jack and Maggie. However, supporting for his family has become a full time job and as such he's forgotten all about having an imagination, playing with his kids, spending time with his family, and enjoying his life. And in the middle of all of this, there's Capt. James S. Hook, life long enemy of Peter Pan (Banning, though unbeknownst to him). In an act of vengeance, he kidnaps Banning's kids in the night, and tinkerbell comes home to bring Peter back to Never Neverland and make Peter remember the life he left behind and the fight that was never finished.<br />Mr. Spielberg went all out on this movie, and it shows. There's a lot of heart and soul here from the pirate ships to the lost boys hideout to London and back again. At the same time, there's a lot of heart in both the screenplay and the actors embodiment of the characters. I don't think there will ever be a Hook as good as the one that Dustin Hoffman has done in this film, Bob Hoskins is always a pleasure to watch and his comedic timing is near perfect, causing everything from a slight chuckle to uproarious laughter to pass your lips after each scene he's in, and William's Peter Banning/Pan, while extrodinarily silly and misguided at times, comes around brilliantly, and the first time you watch him fly you can't help but grin from ear to ear.<br />The child talent is always a risky business, but if you accept that the kids are not going to be the best actors in the world, you realize that most of them do the script justice, whether they know they are or not. Charlie Korsmo, along with Dante Basco, are clearly the most talented, carrying their scenes with Williams and Hoffman very well. <br />John Williams score is as wonderful as it ever was (you can hear some of the framework for the Harry Potter music in this particular score)...<br />And finally, there's the message...\\"never grow up\\". It's the same message from the original movie, but how it gets there is slightly different. As we watch Peter Banning remember and relive the life he left behind, we realize what he realizes; growing old doesn't mean you have to grow up...and you have to live...for that is the \\"great adventure\\". <br />At 2 hours and 20 minutes, the movie drags here and there a bit from time to time. And on no fault of the original production, the special effects of the film have not held up as well as they could have in the last 13 years. The movie is starting to look it's age. But I think no matter how old this movie gets, there will always be people who will be taken back by the simple premise of this movie and embrace it for the wonderful way it's taken the original Peter Pan story to a whole new level...and beyond.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye West has given us a classic, I think.  It's hip-hop at its truest.  Not 50 Cent, not Chingy, but it brings you back the 90's, the best era of Hip-Hop.  The only thing is there's only 20 tracks, but it says there's 21 on your CD player.  Here's the listing with my rating:<br />Intro<BR>&quot;We Don't Care&quot;- A sound for the kids, and the song that starts his smarta$$ persona(no offense).<br />Graduation Day(interlude)<br />&quot;All Falls Down&quot;- I'm not a fan of the video, but the song is very catchy.<br />I'll Fly Away(interlude)- A good short sing song.<br />&quot;Spaceship&quot;- A good song.  Kanye raps about robbing the store he works at, Consequence and GLC rap about the struggle, and the chorus samples Marvin Gaye.<br />&quot;Jesus Walks&quot;- One of my favorite songs.  The second verse is very influential, because he talks about how people get in trouble for discussing Jesus.<br />&quot;Never Let Me Down&quot;- Jay-Z delivers two tight rhymes(especially his last rhymes on his second verse).  I don't like J. Ivy, but Kanye drops a very influential verse, and almost outrhymes Jay.<br />&quot;Get Em' High&quot;- Not one of my favorites, but it is a good song.  Talib Kweli and Common both drop excellant verses.<br />Workout Plan(interlude)<br />&quot;New Workout Plan&quot;- It isn't one of my favorites, but it is a fun song, with crazy humor and nice ans surprisingly nice singing by Kanye when he does. <br />&quot;Slow Jamz&quot;- A smooth song.  One of my favorites.  Twista and Kanye both drop tight verses, and Jamie Foxx delivers a great chorus.<br />&quot;Breathe In, Breathe Out&quot;- I would've liked to hear Luda drop a verse, but he does drop a cool hook while Kanye drops humor on the verses.<br />School Spirit Skit 1(interlude)<br />School Spirit- It's a good song but I don't like that it's edited.<br />Lil' Jimmy Skit<br />&quot;Two Words&quot;- My other favorite song.  It's a tight beat and Kanye, Mos Def, and Freeway all deliver tight verses.<br />&quot;Through The Wire&quot;- An emotional song to listen 2, because Kanye's mouth is wired shut when he's rappin it.  It is one of my favorites though.<br />&quot;Family Business&quot;- My last favorite song.  Kanye talks about his family and manages to make fun of himself a bit.  Nice beat.<br />&quot;Last Call&quot;- I like this song, but it's not one of my favorites.  If you keep listening, Kanye spends alot of time at the end talking about how he got to where he's at.  <br />Overall, this album's one of my favorites in my collection.  Kanye's not the best lyricist, but he's probably the truest.  He kinda reminds you of Nas in his early years.
B0000B1OFL|4.0|cute movie, but there was a bit too much mini-cooper in it.<br />come on, is this a movie or commerical?
B00007BH3Y|5.0|His music inspired the movie-literally. Michael Cunningham, the author of The Hours, was inspired by Glass in the writing of this novel and adeptly describes his influence in the leaflet of this soundtrack.<br />To begin with- he breaks all the rules. I bought the piano sheet music to &quot;Dead Things&quot; and where I naturally felt I should crescendo, he purposely demands pianississimo- very, very quiet. He purposely silences the most moving elements, as if to say &quot;wait. just feel it first- dont take it.&quot;<br />I hate when people think his music is plain - if one understands music, they know that his work is composed of silk-thin layers of delicated melodies- triplets with one hand, doublets with the other. For those of you out there that dont read music, try to divide a second into 3 equal time frames and tap that beat with your left hand. Then take the same second and divide it into 2 equal time frames and tap that beat at the same time with your right hand. Intuitively, its difficult to do. This is his trademark- he forces musicians to play against their intuition.<br />As another example, try to tap your pinky and middle finger at the same time. Then tap your ring finger and thumb at the same time. Now alternate quickly. Try to do it for 5 minutes and when you have got that down- do it with your other hand. But use different fingers. And do that 3-2 ratio beat thing.<br />Confusing? I would certainly think so.<br />It seems as if such a product could only be made by an eccentric and unyielding mathematician- but when you listen, it has a depth of emotional delicacy that could only be compared to trying to hold onto something you truly love over the edge of the world, with a gradually thinning silver string.<br />I guess what Im saying is- pay the 10, 15 bucks. Its worth it.
0446677450|5.0|This book was one of the most profound books I have ever read.  I'm surprised to see so many bad reviews.  It really opened my mind to a lot of possibilities and cemented some beliefs I already had.<br />Do a Google search to read some of Kiyosaki's critics.  They have some decent points but I believe they are too critical.<br />Awesome book!  A must read.
6304005490|3.0|I found this video in the stores recently. Now, mind you, I have already seen this movie when it was in the theaters.  Then it seemed like a light hearted romp. By today's standards, it is virtually archaic in the acting and the script. Still, it is DEFINITELY a PG film.
0743424425|5.0|A homicidal Jack Torrence never screams &quot;Heeeeeeeeeeeeeere's Johnny!&quot; In Stephen king's classic novel. The story doesn't culminate in a frenzied chase through a hedge maze. There are no twin ghosts at the end of the hall inviting young Danny to come play. And no, Jack's novel does not consist entirely of the phrase &quot;All work and no play make Jack a dull boy.&quot; In fact, almost every one of the Shining's cliches are the invention of Stanley Kubric, and they make for an ingenius movie. But for all of the film's merits, I maintain that the book was much better<br />The story of King's novel has passed into legend, so I guess I shouldn't have to retell it, but I believe it bears rtepeating, so here goes: Jack Torrence, ex-alchoholic,  struggling writer, and decent family man, has taken a job as the winter caretaker for the luxurious Overlook hotel, a high-class Colorado resort located all the way up in the mountains. He and the family pack up and head for the hotel, expecting a nice winter in their big luxury hotel. Jack relishes this as the opportunity to work on that play he's been wanting to write. Wendy hopes the winter will bring the family together. And little Danny, well, he doesn't like the hotel. Soon they're snowed in, and that's when the trouble really starts. The hotel is haunted, and the ghosts aim to drive Jack crazy. Danny, thanks to a psychic voice in hs head named Tony, is the only one who can stop the madness. His only help is a cook, who is able to communicate with Danny by telepathy. Problem is, he's in Florida. Its the classic haunted house story, but beefed up with the brilliance of Stephen King.<br />And the Shining truly is an original novel. King's character developement is fantastic, without being tedious or bogging down the story. The plot is instantly engrossng and addictive. Danny's psychic trips are horrific, and powerfully written. The whole novel is full of strong imigary, which serves to set a dark, eerie mood, the constant feeling that something isn't right. The forray's into Jack's troubled past are fascinating, as are the discoveries Jack makes about the Overlook's unusual history. <BR>Torrence's descent into madness is brilliantly doccumented, and makes for riveting reading. The story's climax is both satisfying and sad, wrapping everything up nicely and letting the story go out with a bang, so to speak.<BR>In other words, movie: good. Book: better.
B00005LMBK|5.0|Before Gorillaz I had never heard of Damon Albarn, or Blur, or anything like that. But I had heard of Del Tha Funky Homosapien who raps on Clint Eastwood and Rock The House. I also knew Dan the Automator who produced the Gorillaz Self-titled debut. I'm a pretty big rap fan but I like rock as well. So being a big Del fan I heard he was going to be involved in a brand-new, experimental rock band. It sounded cool so I awaited the album. Then I started hearing Clint Eastwood on the radio. What an excellent song. A dark sounding hip-hop beat with an incredible piano loop. I loved the sleepy vocals on the chorus and Del's rhymes were tighter than ever.<br />After that I had to pick up the album. I went out that day and got it. And to tell you the truth I didn't like it that much. I was expecting an album of &quot;clint eastwood&quot; thinking Gorillaz was a hip-hop band. But after getting over that and listening to the album more it grew on me and I fell in love with it. This is truly one of the most creative and abstract albums i've heard. I like all kinds of music and that's one of the reasons why I love this album. So many sounds come together in this album. Hip-hop, blues, jazz, rock, reggae it's all there. Even the idea behind the band and image is great. The idea of a cartoon band with each member being represented by a crazy cartoon is excellent. This also makes their videos pretty awesome.<br />So if you're looking for something new, and are open minded I would suggest this album. Over anything else. It's got the best from so many different kinds of music it's hard not to love it. One problem though, I need the second album!!
B000002J0B|1.0|More CD from strange band.  Man who sing songs look like a man but still sound like woman.  Most song sound like hippie write them. And why children not wearing clothes on CD cover?? And who ever see a orange sky like on cover.  You listen too long this CD give you headache.  You want understanding songs then don't buy CD. You buy Madonna CD if that what you want.  Brintey Spears good too.

B0001AVZA8|3.0|Something's Gotta Give is a romantic comedy that pairs Jack Nicholson &amp; Diane Keaton for the first time since 1981's Reds.  The film is a romantic comedy about Harry Sanborn (Mr. Nicholson), a 63-year-old playboy who is infamous for never having been married.  Harry has a penchant for women half his age and the film opens with him driving to the Hamptons home of 30-year-old Marin (Amanda Peet).  Marin's mother is a famous playwright, Erica Barry (Ms. Keaton) who is not supposed home.  While Harry is in the kitchen, Erica &amp; her sister Zoe (Frances McDormand) come into the house and mistake him for an intruder.  When Erica finds out he is dating her daughter, she immediately dislikes Harry.  While engaged in some foreplay with Marin, Harry suffers a mild heart attack and is rushed to hospital.  The scene of Harry being taken in on a gurney will be repeated several times throughout the film.  The attending physician, Dr. Julian Mercer, turns out to be a big fan of Erica's and asks her out to dinner.  Harry is forced to recuperate at Erica's house and sparks fly between the two and they end up sleeping together.  The romance doesn't last as Harry is not the commitment type and Erica is heartbroken.  The play Erica is writing ends up to be about the their relationship and it is a smash hit and Erica ends up with Julian.  Harry has second thoughts about the relationship and eventually tracks Erica down to Paris where she is with Julian.  In the end, Erica &amp; Harry end up together with Marin being married and having a baby.  Ms. Keaton won a great deal of praise for her role including winning a Golden Globe and garnering an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress.  While Ms. Keaton is good in her role, her character seems a bit too whiny.  The premise of the movie is supposed to be that middle-aged woman are desirable as they have strength, smarts and looks even though middle-aged men overlook them for younger women.  Ms. Keaton comes off as flighty and emotionally high strung that puts her against the premises.  Her relationship with the much younger doctor is the retort to Harry's dalliances with younger women, but it doesn't seem to be a believable relationship.  Mr. Nicholson is perfect in his role, as he is essentially playing a character he has played numerous times.  Ms. Peet is also quite good as is Ms. McDormand in a under utilized part.nally high strung that puts her against the premises.

The anticipation of seeing if Lizzy will end her 'prejudice' against Darcy will keep you glued to your Lazy Boy.

B0002JJBZE|5.0|After barely getting renewed for a second season, ST came back the next year in full force.The biggest hero was not Captain Kirk himself,but Gene Coon.The executive producer who contributed some of the best episodes, as well as set the tone for the show which inspired future Trek's as well.<BR>  One of the prime factors for the second season's brilliance was the charater's themselves as the actors found the tone of their characters.And the famous trio of Kirk-Spock -McCoy were finally established at the focal point of the show.The remaining supporting characters performed admirably as well, even with the introduction of Paval Chekov (Walter Keonig). Many classic episodes came from season two(Mirror,Mirror, Amok Time, Doomsday Machine, Deadly Years,Trouble With Tribbles, A Piece Of The Action, Journey to Babel).<BR> As brilliant as season two was, it was not enough to get high numbers in the Nielsons.Thanks to a letter campaign by fans led by Bjo Trimble,ST was renewed for a third season.But with Coon's departure from the show after the second season,the third season suffered and even the fans couldn't save it.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I went into the theatres not expecting much, but looking forward to a nice time travel movie.  Man, was I surprised.  This is the best movie I've seen all year!  Now, I'll admit I was a little skeptical of Ashton Kutcher in this role, simply because his past characters have been....idiots.  But I gave him a chance as I would with anyone, and he didn't dissappoint.  The begining is a little bumpy, going over Evan's childhood, but once we get caught up it moves to a much quicker pace.  There's nothing in this movie I didn't like, and I can't see why anyone wouldn't like it.
B00003CXB2|5.0|LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is, without a doubt, the greatest historical epic ever filmed and the crowning achievement of David Lean's career.  It's also the film that makes best use of the majestic desert landscape with shots of extraordinary rock formations, dunes, shimmering \\"mirages,\\" and caravans making their way across seemingly endless sands.<br />LAWRENCE OF ARABIA tells the story of T.E. Lawrence and his adventures in the Middle East during World War I as he led the Arab revolt against the Turks.  It is loosely based on Lawrence's book, THE SEVEN PILLARS OF WISDOM.<br />Even though there are battle scenes in LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, this film is, first and foremost, a character study of Lawrence who was, by anyone's account, a fascinating figure.  Even the battle scenes serve to enhance the character of Lawrence rather than detailing the horrors of war and we see Lawrence's dark, embittered side as well as his heroic one.<br />Although Peter O'Toole wasn't David Lean's first choice to play Lawrence (both Marlon Brando and Albert Finney were offered the part), I can't imagine anyone else in the title role.<br />Omar Sharif is impressive as Sherif Ali Ibn El Kharish.  Prior to this film, he was a virtual unknown, but LAWRENCE OF ARABIA launched Sharif on a long career that made him instantly recognizable the world over.<br />Even though O'Toole and Sharif weren't well-known when they starred in LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, the film's supporting case is certainly stellar:  Alec Guiness, Anthony Quinn, Jose Ferrer and Claude Raines.<br />Although I think LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is best viewed on a large theatrical screen, this doesn't mean anyone should pass up the DVD.  It's just too good for that, especially the Director's Cut (but do make sure you get the widescreen edition; this film demands it).<br />Don't watch LAWRENCE OF ARABIA expecting to get a history lesson.  Watch it to learn more about the fascinating man who was T.E.Lawrence.  If you do, I can't see any way you'll be disappointed.
B00003CX96|5.0|This film has wide appeal. At the outset it really seems to be one of those movies that were made specifically to cater to rising trends of the times -- in this case, the bike boom of the early 70's. And yet, even though our protagonist rides a Masi, this film has few things in common with other flicks like Torque, The Fast and the Furious, Top Gun, Wildstyle, Quicksilver and others that feebly attempt to elevate their respective scenes to almost mythical underground status by building stories and jargon completely around the sport or subject itself. Initially I watched Breaking Away because I was into bicycles. But bicycles in this movie surprisingly take somewhat of a backseat in relation to its main thrust; this film could be said to be not just about coming of age in small town America but more about taking pride in your own cultural identity while finding the courage to pursue your own dreams. And however cliche it might sound, the struggle is a real one, especially concerning the 'vicious cycle' that exists in our supposedly classless American society. And this I think, has a far more timeless appeal than a kid going around thinking he's a professional italian cyclist, however charming it may seem.
B00000K31V|3.0|It's hard to rate this movie, especially without giving away any plot spoilers (which has to do with periods of bad acting). However it's a fun ride, yet it feels as though the whole &quot;game world&quot; wasn't as fully explored as it could have been. A few scenes, namely the &quot;Chinese Waiter&quot; one, are fantastic, while some are boring...like the car ride in the beginning. The plot itself is pretty easy to understand once you watch the movie twice, or just pay attention the first time. This is no Matrix, and it should hardly be compared to it (I'm not saying The Matrix is good or bad: the only thing these movies have in common is the ability to link up into a fictional world). I bought this as a blind buy and was slightly dissapointed...especially after watching Crash. Check out Equilibrium as well.

B00003CXCT|5.0|I for one love star wars.  I grew up watching them and had the original figures from the late 70's early 80's.  If your taking your shot at this epic trilogy you are not a Star Wars fan, sorry to say but go off to the movies and watch your new computer image special effects and let us real star wars fans enjoy this.  So what if he made a little bit of change and tried to improve it.  You still got to apreciate its purity and what it still brings and dobly digital suround sound, what more can you want. We have been waiting to play this dvd trilogy on our suround sound system for years.  So all of you that are bashing this out there you are full of it.  Oh bla bla bla, i cant believe your even questioning wheather it was a good series in the first place.  We are talking about STAR WARS for gods sake!!  I for one am glad that its on dvd, i know a bunch of people that have been dying for this too come out!  Hello now all of a sudden its on dvd and everyone is taking hits at George Lucas at the stuff because he added some a few years back.  Im so glad that this is finally out and am going to enjoy every bit of it as a STAR WARS FAN and with what they had to work with back then.  Love everything no matter what people say i aint got nothing but love for the whole Star Wars trilogy and the other trilogy they are finishing up now.  I cant wait for that super star destroyer to role through my living room with the suround sound around my living room.  Now thats star wars at its best.  You under estimate this and you know what?? Thats no moon, thats a space station!!
B0001W8Q9Y|3.0|Not worth the long wait. I really enjoy a few tracks but the whole marbles concept is a nusence to the rest of the album. you'll listen to the marbles titled tracks once and skip them everytime afterwards. The effects used for atmoshphere and ambience is pretty mediocre as well as the programming. Sliding the pick across the strings went out years ago, and the vocal sampling sounds like it was put down in one take. After hearing these 12 songs it would be really hard to put out any more cash for the full album.
B00009V7RF|5.0|I have never really heard about the B.E.P.  until this album. (Ok dont' shoot me for being in the dark).  This album is extraordinary.  This is a great compilation and the lyrics are profound.  The lyrics in &quot;Where Is The Love&quot;  deals with modern day issues.  I also saw the video for &quot;Hey Mama&quot; and man these guys can shake their booties.  If the B.E.P keep dropping their future albums like this one they have a fan for life in me.
B00006JKOM|2.0|&gt;Lay off....I simply can't understand why people get on Ian for writing something a little lighter than was usual after yelling at him for confusing them with &quot;A Passion Play&quot;.<br />It may your anti-lights are distinct from your confused; there is a range of opinion: it isn't just a matter of thumbs up or thumbs down. For the record, so to speak, I've, myself, never thought &quot;A Passion Play&quot; confusing, although as it turns out, my interpretation of it happens not to jibe with what Ian Anderson says he intended (and I LIKE &quot;A Passion Play&quot;). For that matter, I don't think the problem with THIS record is that it's too &quot;light&quot;; I think, rather, that it's too devoid of content (I do NOT like &quot;Too Old to Rock and Roll, Too Young to Die&quot;). That's ME; I speak only for myself.<br />Putting this aside for now, try to see that no one here is &quot;get[ting] on&quot; or &quot;yelling at&quot; Ian Anderson. We have been requested by our host to submit our individual assessments of various recordings as honestly as possible. If my assessment, for example, is different from yours, take it in stride; you have no business telling me or anyone else to &quot;lay off&quot;. You write your review, and we'll write ours (and as soon as you start reviewing the record and stop reviewing the reviews with which you happen to disagree, I'll stop reviewing YOUR reviews).

B00028HBKM|4.0|When I first heard that Mr. Gibson was directing a movie about the last 12 hours of Christ, I thought that the film would cause discontent amongst several religious groups.  I wasn't completely wrong about that.  The movie was rated as a \\"religious gore\\" film; too much blood and too much suffering (and I'm not a fan of neither).  I must say that the film AS A FILM is excellent, nevertheless.  Great photography, soundtrack, direction and acting.<BR>BUT..... Seems to me that Mr. Gibson wrote a whole new story.  I did some research and found out that the story told in the film was made up with fragments of a couple of the books wrote by the apostles......<BR>SO PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT THE FILM SHOWS THE TRUTH ABOUT JESUS CHRIST, BECAUSE IT PROBABLY DOESN'T.

B0001Z52RU|5.0|What an awesome flick.  I had to pause it on occasion just to rest from the mental barrage.  This one will keep me thinking about it for days and I will need to watch it again to find things I may have missed.  I knew very little of Kucher before this, other than most critics diss him routinely, but I thought he did a great job.  Yeah, there might have been a few inconsistencies, but unless you've time travelled and know exactly what to expect, just get over it and enjoy the movie!
B000268QB2|4.0|Stop listening to your conditioned notions of what is good and what is not in today's music.  This CD contains straight forward rock ballads that are beautifully produced while soaring with beautiful vocals working together perfectly with lush instruments.  Straight up just a damn good CD.  Listen to one of the songs on the album first.  If you like it, then I promise you will enjoy the CD. I give it a 4.5 overall.
B00004Z400|5.0|With the Deftone's third album, White Pony, they set themselves apart from the posers, packaging their usual hammer heavy hardness with a newly attained level of dense, haunting, and textured rock and roll that can only be safely classified as &quot;moody art rock.&quot;  <br />The moods swing from the demonic rage of &quot;Elite&quot; or &quot;Korea,&quot; where front man Chino Moreno spends most of his time screeching in his now familiar roar, to flashes of Cure-style goth on &quot;Digital Bath&quot; and  &quot;Passenger,&quot; (which features guest vocals from Maynard James Keenan of Tool). There's even a ballad.  The soft and thoughtful &quot;Teenager&quot; sounds like a lament of the carefree days of youth.<br />Standout tracks include &quot;Change (In the House of Flies),&quot; &quot;Passenger,&quot; and &quot;Digital Bath,&quot; a song that, at it's core, refers to murder, but sounds almost sweet on the surface.  This ambiguisness runs through the record on other tracks like &quot;Knife Party&quot; and &quot;RX Queen.&quot;<br />The new sound is softer than Adrenaline and Around The Fur, but provides the same emotion and intensity without missing a beat.  The lovelorn heart of Moreno beats as that of a poet and on White Pony you will feel his sorrow in a swoon of multidirectional harmony and pain.<br />The record is as complex in its message as it is musically layered.  The Deftones have always scated the line between hard and heavy rock and roll and moody art rock.  White Pony is the perfect product, a haunting and textured rock record that announces The Deftones as one of the most intelligent, playful, and critically acclaimed bands in the biz.
B000002JB3|2.0|With more of an expiramental ege and less of a bad pop sheen then Phil Collins general fare Dance Into The Light is a 2 1/2 star album.

B00005JM0B|4.0|When I saw the second Terminator film, \\"Judgement Day\\" I didn't feel the story had come to a complete circle, yet. It needed to fulfill it's prophecy like in Sophocles' play, \\"Oedipus Rex.\\" In the play, Oedipus is foretold of a dire and tragic future, and in his determination to change this terrible prediction, he actually caused it to happen. T-3 was inevitable. I wished the director, James Cameron had seen it that way, too, and had wanted to continue telling his story in the third installment.  This film needed his magic touch. The chase scene in the beginning of the film was exciting; Sarah Connor being dead was disappointing, but the actress Linda Hamilton turned down the T-3 script because the part the screenwriters penned for her was too weak.  Good move on Linda's part.

B00000K19E|5.0|After hearing so many good things about this film, I was actually underwhelmed the first time I saw it.  I already new the basic premise so it wasn't a surprise to me.  It wasn't until the SECOND time I saw it that it really hit me.  Very well written, with some philosophical underpinnings hidden throughout, the Matrix is a smart sci-fi action film -- but not TOO smart: that would have to wait until The Matrix Reloaded (which is so dense it's hard to understand what's going on with just one viewing).
B00005Q4CS|4.0|This is one of those few movies where you actually stare at the tv screen for more than 5 minutes after the film is over...it's just that good. To say this is brilliant film-making is an understatement.  Ellen Burnstyn gave of the best performances I have ever (and I repeat, EVER!) seen on film. What really pisses me off is that she was nominated for an Oscar the same year that Julia Roberts won for that piece of trite called &quot;Erin Brockovitch&quot;....talk about wanting a recount!  Miss Burnstyn won that Oscar in my eyes that year.  And, I firmly believe that this movie should be sent to schools that participate in the &quot;Just Say No&quot; program.  It may be rated R (or in some versions, NC-17) but this is what really happens to people who abuse drugs.  The last 10 minutes of this movie will either move you to tears, or make you get up and leave the room...it's just that powerful. (mainly it's the technique the filmaker uses to cut to the different scenes...also the soundtrack is pretty intense as well).  I urge you to see this.

And with this special edition release you also damaged the unique magic present on the original films. George, you don't deserve any more money from star wars fans.

She doesn't likes children and she treats them very hard. Only the class teacher Miss Honey of Matilda is nice and kindly to their children. The parents of Matilda doesn't interests in Matilda and in her especially talents. Often Matilda punish her parents a little bit, because they aren't nice to her. I have one sister and one brother and when they get on my nerves, I play sometimes practical tricks on them. This book is very detailed and I like the characters of the person, because they describe the persons very good. I can imagine how the persons look like.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|This compilation is first rate.  It includes much of the essential Bruce.  In the past, many of the offerings were far from being as thorough as this one.  I picked it up for less than twenty dollars which is pretty amazing when you consider how much is included.  A &quot;can't go wrong&quot; selection.
B00000JQFM|1.0|All I can really say about this is that I got it at the exact same time that I found that most coveted of musical schlock, William Shatner, &quot;The Transformed Man.&quot;  I am a man of musical humour whose taste runs much more towards emotional involvement and interest in what the musician is trying to tell me.  I found none of that in either one of these albums.  If you're new to guitar and have heard about the magic sounds of this mad genius than my advice is for you to, rather run out and search for Andres Segovia or Jimi Hendrix as both drip with emotion and incredible guitar skill, (not to mention ingenuity which is the defense of most Satch fans).<BR>This album is sadly lacking.  If you're bound and determined to get this than may I also suggest the fascinating works of William Shatner?
B0000029GA|5.0|Nas, this album is amazing. i bought this album 10 years after it came out. i got it with tha anniversary edition. i always heard how good it was and it was tha best rap album out there. i listened and i just wanted more 10 songs wasnt enough. this album is hott and theres no big name apperances, no super producers like neptunes or kanyae west. jus large professor, q-tip,az and tha best nas. his lyrics r like no other. from begining to end its crazy. if yur a new rap fan or old u need this. to know where rap came from or where its goin this is where it started. with ILLMATIC
0380807343|2.0|I give this book 2 stars for the writing talent the author has shown in the past and continues to display in this book.  He obviously has a 5-star talent.  But this book is not so much scarey as truly creepy -- and not in a nice way.  This book is just ugly.  And the pictures were even uglier.  Think of the emotional reaction to something really sad and sick -- like maybe chronic skin infection exhudate, and that is my reaction to this story.  E-e-e-w-h!  If that is what you like, then the rating should be 5-star.  But if you want a nice day with nice images in your brain, then avoid this book.
B00004Z459|3.0|The only reason I've heard any Linkin Park songs is because my 14 year old son listens to it. Mostly, I'm just relieved it doesn't contain nasty lyrics. Many of the negative &quot;reviews&quot; here remind me of what people said about Boston, Foreigner, and REO Speedwagon in the 1970's, that they were just &quot;power pop&quot; and not true rock and roll like the Stones and Led Zeppelin. Some truth to that, but so what? I listened to Led Zep and REO Speedwagon. The formula-driven songs and slick production of Linkin Park (which are clearly evident amid all the screaming) suggest to me they are just a newer form of power pop with some rap thrown in the mix. In a year or so I expect my son will have moved on to something else and won't want to admit he ever liked Linkin Park. Me, I'll just stick to my Def Leppard.

B00004STOZ|5.0|Keith Jarrett plays his harpsichord as if posessed by Bach's ghost, but I suspect Mr. Jarrett's musical talents might have even surpassed the old Master himself. My absolute favorite recording of the GV's - and I own quite a few. I can't recommend this CD more highly.
0316776963|3.0|if you are a fan of this writer, and i officially am, this is one novel that will not disappoint. He is brash, he is amusing, he is self-centered (not so much this time out), he is very unorthodox. Nothing he writes will set the world on fire, but he's clearly not trying to do that. All he is trying to do is have a good time, his way, the only way he really seems to know how.<br />Sedaris strikes me as one of those reclusive writers, the ones who really don't want to be around too many people who know their faces, but have no problem expressing themselves through the written word, speaking to us, baring his soul, without ever having to look into our eyes. He strikes me as that kind of character, really. Just look at his photo on back. A picture of someone who is totally uncomfortable posing for the camera, insisting on a natural action shot. Never speaking to us directly.<br />Sure, sure, he has his public radio work, he does his appearances, fine. But those are contributions rather than fame. Sedaris doesn't seem to adhere to the social understanding that he has \\"made it.\\" and he doesn't care. he just wants someone to talk to. without actually talking to anyone.<br />great scam he has though, i admit. little essays about this and that. nothing major, nothing really minor. just having a conversation. telling a story to an audience held captive by their own devices. what a fine read this book is! my favorite stories involve his times in paris trying to understand the language, a little piece about taking responsibility for a turd in a friends toilet and a rather long dissertation concerning a family dog. one story really bothered me. it was about his riding a train in france with his partner and a married american couple are badmouthing him to each other, thinking him french and not able to understand their words. he lets it all fall off his back with no redemption. I WOULD HAVE LET THEM HAVE IT! and it bothered me that he would let himself get so beaten up by these ignorant steers!<br />but there it is. he had successfully drawn me into his story to the point where i not only identified with the character, but i sympathized. and that's all i ask. but when he moves me to higher levels, goes above and beyond the call of duty, showing me ingenius creativity and flare that just knocks me for a loop...he'll get 4 stars.ignorant steers!<br />but there it is. he had successfully drawn me into his story to the point where i not only identified with the character, but i sympathized. and that's all i ask. but when he moves me to higher levels, goes above and beyond the call of duty, showing me ingenius creativity and flare that just knocks me for a loop...he'll get 4 stars.
B000002J0B|5.0|houses of the holy was the fifth led zep album which followed the massively succesful fourth album and though it was good but it could not match up to the greatness of its predecessor.i still enjoy this album after many listens to due to the of favourites like the song remains the same,the rain song and over the hills and far away.very highly recommended.get it after getting their first,second and fourth albums.
B0001XAOL6|5.0|Ali - The Director's Cut, takes about 20 or so minutes out of the original movie and adds about 28 minutes of new footage back into the movie. According to Michael Mann, both versions are truly director's cuts, and this one simply emphasizes the politics a bit more. This is what a director's cut should be. A true redo of the movie, not adding in an extended scene or two to get an &quot;unrated&quot; DVD to sell more. <br />Will Smith gives an incredibly powerful performance as Cassius Clay, aka Muhammed Ali. Mario Van Peebles does a great job as Malcom X, and Jamie Foxx is wonderful as Bundini.  The movie shows how Ali was manipulated by his management, but also how he stuck to his beliefs.<br />Will Smith delivers the line so convincingly, it's amazingly powerful and heartfelt. Not only the lines, but Will also took real punches in the movie. They hired professional boxers to play Frazier, Sonny Liston, and and George Foreman, who were allowed to throw real punches at Will but stop at incapacitating him. The realism shows in the boxing scenes. The movie ends at the Rumble in the Jungle, an excellent place to end the story of Ali. We all know the sadness that followed later in life, but there's no need to go into it in the movie.<br />If you enjoyed the original version of Ali, definitely check it out.
B00007J36G|5.0|Great CD. This is the best I've heard in years. This is great music from the first track to the last.If you get the chance listen to the DVD audio mix of this album. The surround sound is fantastic.

B0001UL7RY|1.0|I have to give Avril credit, she really knows how to market herself.  You are Pop, but you call yourself punk and you act all hard.  You attacked Britney Spears and say hurtful things about her when you have not even met her.  Avril the anti Britney, is more manufactored than Britney, all the way to that stupid tie.<BR>It funny that the production team the wrote 98 percent of her lyrics, actually worked with Britney Spears and Hilary Duff.  Yes the Matrix worked with Avril's two most hated rivals Britney Spears and Hialry Duff.
B0000024JN|5.0|No one expected the Beastie Boys to last as long as they have, and that is part of this album's appeal. Who would have thought way back in 1986 that these white boys who practically yelled and screamed over tracks that masterfully blended rock and rap would still be topping the charts nearly 20 years later? <br />The then-novel concept of rock-rap is courtesy of the genius of producer Rick Rubin. He really knows how to craft a song full of hooks. The beats on this album are so massive they practically burst out of your stereo. Every song has a hook that digs itself into your brain and stays put. The best example of this would be &quot;Paul Revere&quot;, an undeniably entertaining and catchy classic. <br />This wouldn't be much of an album though if it was only a producer who makes it worth listening to. Mike D., Adrock, and MCA have a great chemistry and work very well together. They are so confident and playful it's impossible not to have as good a time as they're having. They even know how to pull off the silliest of rhymes (check out &quot;Girls&quot; for proof). <br />This is a fantastic album. I just got it last week and I have been listening to it over and over ever since. If you are a fan of good, dumb fun, then I highly recommend this CD. Sure, it may appear to be a lot of screaming and yelling, but why complain when it's done so well? There are so many good songs here, including the big hit &quot;Fight For Your Right&quot; (which has held up very well over the years). I give this album my highest recommendation.
B000000OQF|5.0|apetite for destruction was one of the defining eighties rock albums which containes such classic songs like paradise city,welcome to the jungle and sweet child of mine.this is one cd which every self respecting rock fan should own.dont pay much attention to the one star reviews here.buy this classic!!!!!!!.
B00006879E|4.0|I caught a video online for &quot;This Love&quot; and went out and bought the album. Catchy funk-pop. These white boys must have been worshipping at the alter of all funk-ness for a long time. The lead singer can definately be found channeling Stevie Wonder on the last track &quot;Sweetest Goodbye&quot;. The entire album is well written and the band is pretty tight. However this is very much a pop album and the tunes are pretty upbeat (although the lyrics aren't necessarily). I have been listening to it non-stop since I bought it a few days ago.
B00005JM1F|5.0|The Funniest movie of 2003. This slapstick party comedy starring the King of comedy William Ferrel and also starring Lucas Wilson and Vincent Vaughn. The three men who relive their college years when they start a faternity. This film is laugh out loud hilarious. It's the Animal House of the 21st century. it's Ferrel's funniest act since Jay and Silent Bob and Saturday Night Live. The Best scene is Will Ferrel streaking &quot; come on snoop, snoopaloop bring your green hat&quot;. This film will be a classic comedy some day. If you want screwball,slapstick comedy. or if you saw Anchorman first. You'll love Old School. It's a hell of a good parade of party animals. &quot;Blue your my boy&quot;

Each chapter is basically another case brought to Prescious to solve as the 'Number 1 Lady Detective' in Botswana.  As Prescious describes how she solves each case, the reader learns more and more about the people and customs of Botswana.  I look forward to hearing more about Prescious's cases and her clever, common-sense ways of solving them.
6305657947|5.0|I am such an avid movie watcher that I rarely feel inclined to watch a movie more than once.  Well, let me admit to not only having bought the DVD, but to having watched it numerous times!<br /><br />I love the sound track of the movie and will be doing my own remake--going Duo Discus glider riding with my significant other ;).<br /><br />The love scene is wonderful, the chemistry between the actors works like an MIT Lab experiment and the whole movie is simply spot on.<br /><br />I recommend it highly!

1878424114|5.0|...myself included.<br /><br />I first read this book about 4 or 5 years ago when I began my journey towards discovering my Higher Self.  This book is a great read no matter what religion (if any) you  belong to.  Honestly, the fundamental laws that lead to success in the game of life along all lines--health, wealth, peace of mind, love/relationships and true expression--are very simple but few of us are lucky to happen upon them.  Then, for those who do, applying these laws consistently is something that even fewer of us do.<br /><br />My favorite nugget of wisdom from this book is the following:<br />\\"That which doesn't multiply through giving is neither worth giving nor receiving.\\" (pg. 30)<br /><br />I try to keep this insightful idea in mind when I consider not only finanacial and material concerns but my relationships and interactions with people as well.<br /><br />I have read 3 of the author's books and this one is thus far my favorite.

B00006879E|5.0|I went out and bought this album the second I heard \\"This Love\\" on the radio. Adam Levine has one of the sexiest voices I've ever heard, and the music itself is downright catchy. It's soulful and rocking at the same time.

B000002HRE|4.0|i know i know this is one of their downfall albums but i like a lot of music besides thrash metal and this is one of em.Lots of good songs on here the opener is the best song. the band really can do well at what they do but once they experiment they sometimes can lose a lot of fans same with other bands too.But im a true metallica fan(cause they're my fav band)so this album is for me...others that are in love with the old metallica stuff stay away from this.
1558908323|4.0|I'm fussy about the horror/sci-fi I watch but &quot;Mimic&quot; I actually quite liked.<br />The plot it not overly complex, a scientist finds a cure for a terrible disease but at a cost that no one is aware they are going to have to pay at some point in time.<br />Enter a couple of years later two scientists (one who found the cure and her husband), a shoe cleaner/cobbler and his autistic grandson who live near a train station where the horror that is lurking in the form of insects that can mimic human form are hiding out, a world weary security guard and the usual monster insect fodder (people in lay man's terms!) and you have a surprisingly intelligent film.<br />A bit on the gruesome side at times but quite suspenseful and it certainly makes you jump when you least expect it.  The scene in the old train carriage is quite heart stopping and the boy actor who plays the autistic child is especially good with his savant ability to know people by the sound of their footsteps along with the size and make of shoe they wear.<br />It gets a solid four out five and is definitely a film you'd watch with your pals unless you are very brave and totally scare proof which by the way I am not!
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|I had been anxiously waiting for Marillion's new release. Keeping tabs on how this album was coming along on their website and I must say &quot;WOW&quot;.<br />Been listening to Marillion since Script of a Jester's Tear and Marbles is of the finest craftmanship one can expect from such a group of talented people. Marbles is one of their finest works to date if not the best.<br />Genie, The Only Unforgivable Thing, Neverland, Drilling Holes, Marble III, and so on. This entire album is worth every penny and more.<br />Now if only October 12 can get here faster. I have a date for that evening sitting up close to the stage watching them perform Marbles live at Le Capitole in Quebec city. Can it get any better?<br />Go ahead, take out those old marbles or lose a few. In the end this is one CD any Marillion fan should and must own. If you are new to Marillion then Welcome aboard Marillo :)
B00000D9TQ|5.0|In a time when many artists were lucky enough to linger around for one or two hit singles, Phil Collins scored a string of fresh and orginal singles that made him one of the biggest stars of the 1980s'. Few artists had a more impressive hit streak than him: 3 number one hits in a row, 4 additional charttoppers 12 consecutive top 10 hits. &quot;Hits&quot; distills 15 years of timeless music into a 16 - song cd, and while it leaves its share of hits, it's a great collection of great music.<br />Many of Phil's biggest hits are here: the chilling rock opuses &quot;Another Day In Paradise&quot;, &quot;I Wish It Would Rain Down&quot; and &quot;In The Air Tonight&quot;, the bubbly, Motown - style &quot;Two Hearts&quot; (its 1960s' Motown sound thanks in part to legendary Motown producer Lamonte Dozier, who co - wrote and produced it), the angst - ridden &quot;Against All Odds&quot;, the gorgeous cover of &quot;A Groovy Kind Of Love&quot; and the soulful &quot;Something Happened On The Way To Heaven&quot;, to name (more than) just a few. Also, Phil included a new trscl, an R &amp; B - tinged cover of the Cindy Lauper smash &quot;True Colors&quot;. Two more recent songs, &quot;Both Sides Of The Story&quot; and &quot;Dance Into The Light&quot; are very good, too.<br />As I mentioned previously, several songs are missing. Phil had had 25 chart entries by the time this collection was released. Only 15 of those songs are here (&quot;True Colors&quot; was never issued as a single). The following singles listed here unfortunately missed inclusion on this mostly wonderful collection:<br />&quot;I Missed Again&quot; (number 19)<BR>&quot;I Don't Care Anymore&quot; (number 39)<BR>&quot;I Cannot Believe It's True&quot; (number 79)<BR>&quot;Don't Lose My Number&quot; (number 4)<BR>&quot;Do You Remember&quot; (number 4)<BR>&quot;Hang In Long Enough&quot; (number 23)<BR>&quot;Who Said I Would&quot; (number 73)<BR>&quot;Hero&quot; (with David Crosby) (number 44)<BR>&quot;Everyday&quot; (number 24)<BR>&quot;It's In Your Eyes&quot; (number 77)<br />I also wouldn't have minded if the people who put together this set had included a few cuts from Genesis, namely &quot;Invisible Touch&quot;, &quot;In Too Deep&quot; and &quot;I Can't Dance&quot;.<br />Casual fans may complain that two other Collins hits, &quot;You'll Be In My Heart&quot; and &quot;Can't Stop Loving You&quot;, are also excluded. That's because those songs weren't released yet. One final complaint is that it's not in chronological order, though as already pointed out, &quot;Take Me Home&quot; is the best choice for a closer. This a great cd. Here's hoping that a Phil Collins boxed set will be released in the future.
0609610570|5.0|The principles of the book helped us move our stock from $1 to $6 in 2 years. I not only like the book, I now use it as a tool for my consulting business. It helps focusing on the essential and provides a template for structuring a business for success. I believe that it can be adapted to any venture.<br />I recommend it because of its simplicity and connection to reality. If you have managed operations, you will appreciate this down-to-earth layout of how to steadily drive your business or evaluate another business. Use that approach and you are above 99% of the business crowd out there. I am grateful.

Highlights on this album incl.

That's just about everyone on there lol. Buy it..youll enjoy it, and treasure it for years. (...)
B00001PE4D|5.0|i loved this movie and it's second best out of the trilogy.3 uis the best though no contest.
B00004TJJZ|5.0|So much has been written about the brilliance of this gooey sci/fi comedy, that it would be redundant for me to tell you how great it is. But what I enjoyed most about &quot;Men In Black&quot; is that it is such a New York film. <br />When Will Smith is being oriented to his new job by Tommy Lee Jones, he's informed that many New Yorkers are disguised space aliens. &quot;Like cab drivers?&quot; Smith asks. &quot;Not as many as you think,&quot; Jones responds.<br />The fact that the MIB have a car that can defy gravity is funny enough, but the fact that it needs such a vehicle to fight the perpetual traffic in the Midtown Tunnel is even funnier.<br />An alien disguised as a dog in an I LOVE NEW YORK tee-shirt is fairly funny. But when it speaks with a New Yawk accent as thick as Bugs Bunny's it makes it funnier.<br />When the edgar bug alien hauls a mideastern cab driver out of his cab, not funny. When he tosses his wooden-bead back massager at him, funny. But on top of that, when he throws the ubiquitous air freshner out, then its hysterical (without being racist).<br />The whole concept that the World's Fairgrounds in Queens is a hangar for spaceships is just brilliant. And I've always wondered what that structure at the head of the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel was!<br />Glimpses of the World Trade Center are a little bitter to take, even now. And there is that sense that this film is from an innocent pre 9/11 time but, really, the rest of the movie still rings true of the New York of today.
B0001NBMEE|4.0|As soon as I began this DVD, I found myself setting in the massive RKO Keith's theater in Downtown Dayton, Ohio.   The reason I purchased the disk was for that reason.   I am 100% satisfied for in that department.<br />The film score by Franz Waxman is perfection.  It is dramatic and fun.  As an adult, I wish that the transfer had been in Dolby 5.1.  <br />The performances are appropriate for this film except for Mr. Mason who does no wrong.<br />I would like to add that the sword fight at the end of the film is of equal to the excitement found in the final duel in Scaramouche.
B00005ALRO|5.0|What makes &quot;The Fugitive&quot; such a successful and superior film is that it knows what it is: an action/mystery film. It makes no attempt to make itself bigger or more intellectual than it is (as did the American version of &quot;The Vanishing&quot;). Harrison Ford, surprisingly underplaying the role of Dr. Kimball--others might have overworked his grief and angst--turns in a brilliant performance. And the always reliable Tommy Lee Jones does an icy, sparkling job as Kimball's persuer, US Marshal Sam Gerard. So good a performance that he earned a well-deserved Oscar for it.<br />The other key to the movie's success is Andrew Davis' dazzling direction. He keeps the pace frenetic for a good deal of the film, and the pot is always kept boiling. Close calls and intense chases keep the tension and suspense at fever pitch. &quot;The Fugitive&quot; will endure for a long time as a classic action thriller.
B0000029GA|5.0|The year is 1994, a solo debut is on the rise for a 20 year old Nasir Jones, who witnesses ready to be told stories from his apartment window in Queens. He needs to make money, get out of this lifestyle he has been living for years and show the world his talent. Illmatic was originally supposed to be his only released cd, after this, he was going to retire and take his money. But the success of this timeless masterpiece led him to stay and share more of his talent with the world with other great/classic cd's.<BR>An album that gets hate for being so short, really could of been shorter, it's just that perfect. First things first, we have \\"The Genesis\\". This is about 20-30 seconds of a man talking (I think this is from some old movie) where it eventually cuts off with a beat and AZ and other people talking with Nas about how they gotta change the game and light some Phillies and stuff, then at the end he declares, \\"Representing it's Illmatic.\\" After he says that you just know some crazy s*** is about jump off. And so it does. Track 2, \\"NY State of Mind\\", the best song on the album in my opinion, defines what this album and what him as a rapper is about. He spits a long two verse narrative of life on the streets over a blazing DJ Premier beat and it's an instant classic with lines like, \\"It drops deep as the words in my breath, I never sleep cause sleep is the cousin of death.\\" Next we have the calm and relaxing beat of \\"Life's a B****\\" featuring AZ. I don't want to say Nas gets outshined, but it's hard not to when AZ spits debatably one of his best verses in his career. In the last 45 seconds or so of the track, Nas's dad does a solo with his trumpet, very nice. Now we have the great track produced by Pete Rock, \\"The World is Yours\\". This is such a great track as Nas does what he does best and Pete drops a DOPE beat with scratching and just this crazy vibe, one of his best. After that it's \\"Halftime\\" which was a single and with good reason. The beat as with all the others is very nice and lyrically its amazing, \\"Nas why did you do it? You know you got the mad fat fluid when you rhyme, it's halftime.\\" Indeed you do Nas, indeed you do. Then after that mafioso performance we have \\"Memory Lane (Sitting in the Park)\\". I love this track. Again produced by the master Premier, the beat is just almost depressing and makes you really zone out. What can I say about the lyrics, they're great just like every other song on this album while discussing street life. Now for track 7 and what is one of the most memorable tracks on the cd, \\"One Love\\". It features Q-Tip who does the chorus and produces this simple sounding, yet awesome beat. Nas is basically writing a letter to this friend and gives a shout out to another great lyricist who got noticed when Nas said his name, \\"Whattup with Cormega did you see him are yall together?\\". After that he gives us \\"One Time for Your Mind\\". This song doesn't get much recognition, and isn't the best cut on the cd, but every song here is a classic and great beat wise and lyrically. I guess you could just consider it an under-rated track on the album cause people think highly of it, but just hardly ever speak of it. It's produced by Large Professor who is a great producer and really comes through and of course, Nas does it one time for our minds. Track 9 and getting closer to the end, we have \\"Represent\\". Great song with a beat provided by the one and only DJ Premier. Nas just talks about keeping it real and obviously, representing as the last bit of the song is nothing but shout outs to people and NY. Finally it's here, the last track, \\"It Ain't Hard to Tell\\". Once again Large P. comes correct with the smooth, catchy beat. Nas spits some fierce rhymes on this track, some of the best too, check it out, \\"It ain't hard to tell, I excel, then prevail/The mic is contacted, I attract clientele/My mic check is life or death, breathin a sniper's breath/I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps/Deep like The Shinin', sparkle like a diamond/Sneak a uzi on the island in my army jacket linin/Hit the Earth like a comet, invasion/Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian, half-man, half-amazin/Cause in my physical, I can express through song/Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong/I drank Moet with Medusa, give her shotguns in hell/From the spliff that I lift and inhale, it ain't hard to tell.\\" If that isn't a great way to end an album then I don't know what is.<BR>This is absolutely a timeless classic with no flaws to be found. It's possibly the greatest album lyrically and production wise, I mean every track has big name people like Premier, Alchemist, Large P., or Pete Rock, and even the one guest appearance from AZ is priceless. Words can't describe the gold that is implanted on this disc, its rap at its finest. If you don't have this album, GET IT, if you don't like it, then you probably don't understand rap and hip-hop because this album defines them. I guess Nas truly is the street's disciple.
B00005JK2O|4.0|OFFICE SPACE either suffered from bad marketing or poor distribution because I had never heard of it nor did many of my movie-going friends. When I saw it on cable, I kept asking myself, \\"Where did this come from?\\" While the film occasionally breaks down in predictable sequences and cheap shots, it really does hold together remarkably well. This is one of the better written, directed and acted comedies in a long time. Even though the late 90's office world it illustrates is long gone, muddle-headed supervisors, know-nothing consultants, and very weird office workers are not. Enjoy this movie!
0316776963|4.0|I got this book after hearing Sedaris on 'This American Life.' I would laugh out loud at the radio. Sedaris delivers his sarcasm in such a way that reading it one might miss it. However, I still enjoyed the book, perhaps because I could hear his voice in my head.<br />Sedaris shows how a simple story can be turned into a beautiful form as he explores the tiny moments many of us just ignore in search of excitement. He takes a reader from absurdly silly to poignantly melancholy. <br />Dry sarcasm is his main staple. If you don't like your humor as dry as a three-day-old martini this isn't for you.

B0001Z52RU|4.0|But I did.  Because it had Ashton K. in it, and because it got bad reviews I passed on it.  However, watched it this weekend and it was a great movie.  Don't let the Ashton name fool you or the bed reviews it is a really good movie.
B000001EL7|5.0|GREAT ALBUM, BUT SOME VOIDS'S IN SOME SONGS. THE STYLE OF TOMMOROW AND TONIGHT DONT FIT IN AT ALL, BUT THE SONG'S GOOD. HOOLIGAN, HMM NOT BAD, BUT TO BLUESY. PLASTER CASTER IS A SONG, THAT I'VE NEVER LIKED TOO MUCH. AND WHY THEN SHE KISSED ME? IT'S THE ONLY SONGS THAT SUCKS. THE OTHER SONGS ARE 5 STARS SONGS. NOT AS GOOD AS ROCK `N' ROLL OVER- DESTROYER
B00002E23E|3.0|You know already whether you'll like this DVD -- if you're listening to Led Zeppelin right now, then by all means buy this DVD. <br />Those less enamored with the band may find that there's a lot of self-indulgent crap here, and the band seems to be mailing it in on many of the songs. Of course it is the drugs, and fatigue of being on the road, but the listless performances suggest they didn't really care all that much.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I don't know what this trash is about this album sucking....I adore it. INTERVENTION is one of the best Madonna songs ever. Thumbs up baby!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|What is wrong with you people coming in and start trash talking about Britney!?! The reason you're writting reviews here in Amazon is to review the quality of the product! Not to review the Artist, you're not buying them! So if you haven't heard the cd then plz keep your mouth shut cuz its really getting anoyying having people come here and talk about the artist when they're suppose to review the music. Anyways......<br />I bought the album when it came out and heard every track on it. I have to say, i was stunned by the quality and the direction britney is going. I enjoy every track on the C.D and I recommend it to you because this album has a variety of styles and its nothing like her old LPs. Hope You Enjoy It!
B0000TB050|5.0|About half of this show appeared on CBS-TV in the USA months before the DVD release in a documentary titled &quot;U2's Beautiful Day&quot;. In this documentary we learn that on the day of this concert Bonos father has passed. The second of two huge sold-out shows at Sloan Castle a crowd that MUST have topped 6 figures wait enthusiasticly in the rain for arguably the best performance the band has ever given. The 5 channel DTS mastering on the DVD is amazing, the video unfortunatley is a bit over compressed. During a heartfelt speech during &quot;Out of Control&quot; Bono talks about the 500 pounds his father loaned him to record their first demo and thanks the fans for the 500 pounds they each have given the band over the years. Unlike the Boston video recorded a few months earlier the set is complete and relatively un-doctored and truly captures the energy of the bands live performance.<br />I haven't stopped watching this long enough to put it in my PC and check out the DVD-ROM features, But I did watch the &quot;Unforgettable Fire&quot; documentary which seems longer than the one I had on VHS, Admitedly its been a few years since I have watched it so I could be mistaken.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This is by far one of the most enjoyable Broadway albums there are out there. &quot;Wicked&quot; the musical follows the struggle of a paculiar green girl named Elphaba and her friend Glinda who tried to help her. Personal favourite tracks are &quot;Dancing Through Life&quot; and &quot;Defying Gravity&quot;. Kristen and Idina pour their hearts and voices out in this beautiful soundtrack. Defnitly enjoyable and a must buy! After all,  dont you want to find out what happened before Dorothy came along?
B0001Z52RU|1.0|When i rented this film i foreshadowed disapointment. I thought ashton kutcher would ruin the film but he actually made a good performance. This movie was creative and interesting until the end. it was so idiotic. nothing was explained at all. how did he get these powers, why, what was the point. The story was so flawed. This seems like a lame attempt to copy donnie darko!
0156027321|5.0|I think it'd be really hard to come up with hundreds of pages describing life in what amounts to a small room with unchanging scenery. Martel not only comes up with the hundreds of pages, but makes them insightful and entirely compelling. There were a few things in particular that jumped out at me. <br />- The beginning of the book is in a large part, academic backstory; we get information about places and religion and animals and family. But the information is not lectured so much as it is leaked. I felt like I was reading a short account of the coming of age of the protaganist, but embedded in it were all the seeds of the later story.<br />- The internal voice of the protaganist goes beyond consistency and into such a real depth of character that the changes in the way Pi percieves the world make complete sense. The chracter is so well drawn that you begin to anticipate his reactions to new situations. Not that its predictable exactly, it just feels real. <br />- There are parts of the book that test disbelief - at least for me, they were just at the edge - balancing these huge wild creative jumps with the constant character and pacing of the rest of the story. Its athletic writing, so confident and sure footed that Martel as a writer was able to really play in parts, adding to the pleasure of reading. Sort of reminded me of Marquez the way magic and reality are so tightly woven together.<br />As my only reservation, and I'm not really sure if its one or not, it took me several starts to get into this book. I kept having to ratchet myself down, to read slower than I'm used to, to listen more to the words. It was frustrating at first, before I got the rythym down. <br />This is the only recently published book I've read in a long time that I can see keeping on my shelf for a reread in a year or two.
0618526412|1.0|I'm afraid I'll have to agree with the reader from Grants Pass, OR, who wrote in her/his review, &quot;life is too short and the world is too full of good reads to spend time with this one.&quot; I want a book that lifts me up rather than brings me down. For others who feel like I do, I recommend another book I got from Amazon, &quot;People of Passion&quot; by Carl Mays. It is also about people from the South (Appalachia) who had it bad, but they found meaning and purpose in life and had the faith and determination to rise above their circumstances. There is no doubt that Carson McCullers is a talent, it's just that I was depressed by the way she used it with the characters and their decisions in their situations. Unlike, some of the reviewers, I did finish the book, but not with pleasure or satisfaction.
B000089RVX|5.0|I was fortunate enough to see Evanescence in concert, shortly after their Grammy awards win.  Yes, the band was minus one former member.  They were as good live as what you hear on the CD.  Amy Lee is a phenomenon, her voice is an instrument in its own right.  My favorite tracks are Going Under, Bring Me To Life, Imaginary, and My Immortal is extraordinary.<br />Don't fall into the categorization trap, music shouldn't be liked or disliked because it sounds like this or that, or because your friends like or don't like it.  It's about what you like and if it moves you.  Give Fallen a listen and I think you'll like it.
B00020HEL6|5.0|I am going to take the other nine jazz CD's that I have in my collection, pack them up and send them to my favorite charity. Then I am going to put this offering by Renee Olstead into my disk changer...and leave it there. &quot;Renee Olstead&quot;, the debut offering by the remarkable young sitcom and movie actress is an absolutely luminous collection of well-known (and not so well-known) American songs. But beyond being just another jazz CD, this one just happens to be performed by what a growing number of people believe is the most brilliant new voice in the music world today. My favorite track on the CD (so far) is &quot;Taking a Chance On Love,&quot; sung in a perky swinging style and showcasing the tremendous power and color her voice possesses. Throughout the album Renee is able to employ a wide variety of vocal styles, ranging from the angelic &quot;A Love That Will Last&quot;, to the triumphant climax of songs like &quot;Summertime&quot;. She also performs a truly astonishing rendition of &quot;Is You Is Or Is You Ain't My Baby&quot;, and a touching version of &quot;Someone To Watch Over Me&quot; - I had to fight back tears when I first heard it. &quot;Renee Olstead&quot; is by far the best female jazz vocals album I've ever heard. If you buy one such CD in the next ten years, this should be the one. Thank you, Renee!
0393057658|5.0|Beane and his disciples have prosecuted their edge in the draft and they have proven that they can win that way. It is new in some ways and channels an earlier time as well. The emphasis on team play is not an exclusively &quot;moneyball&quot; approach. The Rangers use this old approach in 2004 married to a traditional cadre of scouts that Beane would not use. The result for Texas has been winning baseball that is fun to watch. The play in the field (particularly the infield) is sparkling and they also put runs on the board. As of this writing the own 1st place in AL west. They have a higher payroll, but much of it is dead weight with Messrs Park and Nelson out with injuries.<BR>It is interesting to note that at the All Star break 2004, only three of the league leaders in OBP (over weighted in the A's version of OPS) were A's and the highest ranked was 30th. Perhaps this Oakland secret isn't such a great secret after all. The other &quot;moneyball&quot; team, Boston, has 4 of the top 40. In 2002, the time frame in which the book was written, the A's only had 1 player in the top 40. Perhaps this shows they are progressing. <BR>In 2002, Anaheim had a reputation for being &quot;scrappy&quot; at the plate and won the World Series. Between Anaheim and San Fran (the 2002 opponent) they only had 3 of the top 40 OBP. Does this mean that Oakland and Beane are on the wrong track? They are certainly competitive again this year. Perhaps it means that being obsessed with any thing in a liability in a multidimensional game such as baseball.<BR>Pitching is another interesting area that Beane and Co. have attempted to set on its ear. The sabermetric DIPS ratio is what they like to measure their pitching talent with and it seems to be working. They have 2 of the top 20 pitchers rated using DIPS.<BR>I chuckled under my breath when I read Beane said that Barry Bonds had &quot;risen to a level where even talent can't take you&quot;. Was he talking about BALCO?
B00023B1LC|4.0|this movies was very good. it was one of my favorites.  The next movie in the series the Bourne Supremacy looks good but doesn't exactly follow the main plot line of the book series.  although it does look good and Matt Damon is a good actor i'm going to go see it.  The story is suppose to take place in China I think.  But anyways you should only buy one dvd od this movies cuz this dvd is a way to make money. This dvd is the same as anyother one.  Dont waste your money.
0385484518|1.0|My younger brother had this on his summer reading list and I noticed it on his desk. Seeing it was pretty short I sat down and read it.  I think the fact that my high school's English department recommended it should have been warning enough to avoid this book.  In all seriousness, this is the worst book I have read in a LONG time.<br />Even calling it a book is slightly misleading, because that usually implies some sort of literary value.  It's about as literary as Life's Little Instruction Book, but far less insightful. Albom writes at about a 2nd grade reading level, in a  ridiciulously simple  shallow way rather than a Hemingwayesque style.  Even more ridiculous is his constant use of immature, sentimental little gimmicks that I guess the Oprah-watching soccer moms giving this book a good review would call \\"touching and heartfelt\\".  For example:<br />\\"He waited while I absorbed it.<br />A Teacher to the Last.<br />\\"Good?\\" he said.<br />Yes, I said.  Very good.<br />I would write something like that and be satisified with it when I was probably a freshman, and I really don't consider myself to be a talented writer. The whole Tuesday motif was also along those lines. Even more annoying was I lost count of the epiphanies Mitch has by about the 11th page.  Highlight how many times he \\"suddenly realizes something about life\\".  Don't be materialistic?  Love other people?  Is this really that breakthrough?  I think Jesus said that about 2000 years ago, and most people agree he wasn't even that revolutionary(in moral philosophy that is.)  Look at some of his other ridiculous \\"aphorisms\\":<br />Accept what you are able to do and what you are not able to do.<br />Learn to forgive yourself and forgive others.<br />If I really felt like it, I could probably spew out about four thousand of those obvious, self-righteous statements in about 5 minutes.<br />  I also don't even see how Morrie was such a hero.  In one scene, they tried to convince you that he was some hero for turning down some medicine that wouldn't have helped and, more importantly, wasn't even available.  Wow.  Not to mention, it's pretty easy to be so courageous about death when you have an amazing family supporting you.  I wonder if he was half his age, alone with nobody to help him except some indifferent inner city hospital nurse if he would face death with such resilience and wit.<br />What annoys me the most is how they planned writing this book before Morrie even died.  Sounds like he just wanted to pay some bills.  I mean, if they are planning to write a book about all these great moments Mitch realizes, of course he's going to have them(or pretend to) because he has to write a book about it!  Furthermore, it's pretty arrogant that Morrie to think that he had some great noble truths to spread.<br />This book has several more blatant flaws, but this review has a maxium word limit.  So, I'll say if you like reading Chicken Soup for the Soul, and other empowering self-help books that like to constantly re-emphasize the obvious for $20, go ahead and buy this.  If you are looking for an actual good book by someone who actually knows how to write, don't waste your time or the 40 minutes it takes to read this.down some medicine that wouldn't have helped and, more importantly, wasn't even available.

B000005RSW|5.0|There's so much misinformation and so many contradictory opinions regarding this album floating around that I feel compelled to try to set the record straight. <br />First of all, cheaply produced does not mean poorly produced. This album sounds the way it does for a reason. This is a unique recording; it doesn't sound like the garage-band sludge of early Manowar, such as the forgettable &quot;Hail to England&quot; (thank goodness), nor is it the slick, polished &quot;eighties metal&quot; of every record they made afterwards. This is as close as you can get to &quot;Manowar unplugged&quot;. It's not really a metal album, but a hard rock album. The sound is dry, clean and tight, to match the songwriting. There are all sorts of brilliant little production touches throughout: the zany discombobulated choir of scattered voices on &quot;Animals' is intentional, as some people don't seem to understand, and adds to the song. Likewise, the album cuts off suddenly after Eric Adams sings &quot;mother, mother, mother&quot; on &quot;Guyana&quot;(which by the way sounds a thousand times better here than on a later version on their second live album). This is a reference to the fact that Jim Jones famously shot himself just after saying those very words, as anyone who knows anything about the People's Temple cult will tell you. These are just two examples among dozens of the thought that went into making this record. Small label, yes, over twenty years old, yes, but high quality.<br />About the songs: The only problem is that there are only eight of them (really seven, since the bass instrumental really just acts as an intro to &quot;Guyana&quot;). Every song is a world of its own; they're all different. The first is an old-fashioned strutting rocker; the second one of the very few times Manowar has done an &quot;I like girls&quot; song (I guess when you wear leather underwear on stage you have to make sure everybody knows that on occasion); &quot;Thor&quot; is a melodic battle hymn; &quot;Mountains&quot; is the softest thing they have ever done and as good as anything they have ever done; &quot;Sign of the Hammer&quot; and &quot;The Oath&quot; are weird, energetic, scary battle hymns; and &quot;Guyana&quot; is an eerie, long, atmospheric epic. <br />This album is the place where DeMaio truly found himself as a songwriter, and this album is the place where Adams' vocals are at their absolute peak. His is in great voice, and he shows off both his vocal and emotional range to super effect, and in so doing takes what would otherwise be a very good album and makes it into a real classic.<br />This is the hardest to find and usually most expensive Manowar cd. It has only seven real songs, and clocks in at around forty minutes. Is it really worth buying? You'd better believe it. In the final analysis, it's just one of those records that has that special &quot;something&quot; that makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts, even though some people just don't seem to &quot;get&quot; it. It is not, as some critics think, their best album, but I can understand why someone could seriously make that case, which is more than I can say for the opinion of anyone who believes early Manowar is the best, or that this album is just thrown together, or that it has anything in common with &quot;Hail to England&quot;, etc., etc.
B00005A46T|4.0|Okay this CD is pretty much just sic all around, but here's how it goes (oh, make sure you buy it!!)<br />515- Noises, weird, what can I say.<br />People (...) Very bold, a semi-gradual intro to a very hardcore song, good stuff.<br />Disasterpiece- One of the most sic guitar lines, it flows, it's heavy, it's the sicness.<br />My Plague- I like how this one goes, a rappy set of verses, with a wicked chorus, very thrash towards the end.<br />Everything Ends- I love this song, it has a little bit of depressed-mood lyrics, but it's very fast after you get into it.<br />The Heretic Anthem- Great all around, you gotta love the message, good song live too, gnarly stuff.<br />Gently- This song is a little out of place for this CD, not the greatest, all I can say.<br />Left Behind- Melodical, wicked, great message in the lyrics, Corey isn't the greatest of making sense, but he wrote this one well, show stopper here.<br />The Shape- A verrrry sic song, (like the whole CD, save me some breath) the chorus keeps it pumpin along, you want more, more!<br />I am Hated- A stop from illusions, here is reality, no whinyness here, just THRASH, love the lyrics, it shows alot of feeling.<br />Skin Ticket- Slower at the start, greeaaaatt song though, I love the part\\"Come see my cage built in my grave\\", Corey expresses his hate well, the whole CD.<br />New Abortion- Mick and Jim always put out good riffs, and Joey keeps the pedals pumping, this song is a masterpiece melodically, sic chorus, keeps on flowin.<br />Metabolic- VERY underrated song, my Fav. on the CD, I love where it bridges with the drumroll and the screams, Maggot material extreme here, worship it people.<br />Iowa- Gee, the song that should be the best on the CD sucks, and it's long, wow, chop this parta the cd off.
B00020BVXI|5.0|I recently bumped into Willem Dafoe at the Whole Foods Store in Brentwood.  He was shopping there.  I couldn't believe it.  I was like, &quot;Dude, you're SHOPPING?  I do that stuff!  I don't have to go see a movie to see a dude go SHOPPING!&quot;
B000092Q4U|5.0|LoG's new album ATPGB is a very intense, rageful, evil album. An improvement over NAG because Randall doesn't sound so high pitch, you can understand it all too, it gets you a better feeling and rage to the music when you know the message, and your subconsciense isn't just pickin' it all up. The best guitar lines I've heard in a long time, some crazy stuff, no one can match Randall's throating, a true piece of filth he is, and you've gotta love em for it. Buy this album, you won't be dissapointed.
B00004RFFI|1.0|I rented this movie thinking it was going to be a remake of The Wizard of Oz.  Boy what a letdown.  Come to think of it I had the same experience watching Zardoz.<BR>While watching this movie, it became clear to me that &quot;actors&quot; are people who have been randomly selected to get in front of a camera and pretend to do things.  The characters say things like, &quot;these satellite readings have increased in the last ten minutes&quot;  &quot;Keep monitoring this pattern&quot;  &quot;Ok&quot;  Then there is a tossing aside of sodas and a melee of excited, riot-like running toward vehicles.  Then there is more dialog, like &quot;We're not going to be able to intercept!&quot;  &quot;No, we will. Hang on!&quot;  &quot;Are you out of your mind?&quot;<BR>&quot;We gotta get outta here!&quot;  &quot;I know!&quot;  This last dialog is screamed over the sound of lots of wind.  The movie appears to be about a weather phenomenon  wherein lots of wind causes a general sucking effect:  the script sucks, the acting sucks, the effects even pretty much suck.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Everyone says that Quiet Riot and their debut 'Metal Health' launched a decade of heavy metal madness. AC\DC's Back in Black album was one of the strongest albums of that decade being released in 1980, but it was far from their debut album. Turn the clock back two years to 1978 and we have the true roots of everything the 80's were; decadent, wild, noisy, and ridiculous. Van Halen's debut album Van HAlen 1 started it all.<br />First you got Eddie Van Halen, the guitar hero to millions who took a one minute and forty-two second guitar solo and turned the music world on ite ear. Eruption was aptly named, suddenly every guitarist was tring to figure out what 'finger tapping was all about.<br />Second, what wouyld a band be without a frontman? Is there anyone better at this than Diamond David Lee Roth? Not a supurb singer, but a master showman. Who else can sing 'Running with the Devil', 'Jamie's Cryin', and 'Ain't Talking 'bout Love'? Well aparantly no one if you've ever seen Van Halen live anytime after 1985. David Lee Roth will always be the vocalist for Van Halen for millions of fans. The Van Hagar debate will last forever, but for purists, the debut release is as sweet as it gets.<br />Next we have Michael Anthony. Famous for his Jack Daniels bass guitar in the 80's, his playing is solid. He's not flashy, he's not spectacular. He's a meat and potatos player that keeps things on the ground while Eddie launches himself up into the clouds.<br />The second band member who shares the name Van Halen is the drummer Alex. Though he has been voted many times the ugliest man in rock n roll..... ever, his skin pounding techniques and sense of rhythm are not to be shunned. It's probably only fitting that for the first couple of seconds of Eruption, we get a quick drum intro.<br />Van Halen has gone through ups and down over their 30 year career, but this release will seal their places in rock n roll history.
B00004RFFI|1.0|In the movie, the twister destroys a drive-in while The Shining is showing on the screen.  One could only imagine that this amounted to a review of The Shining.  I don't agree with this review.  The Shining is a very good movie.
B00005JMYG|2.0|This film was terribly unfunny. It tried way too hard. It had absolutely no plot or any kind of motivation for any of the characters. The supporting cast was extremely dull and uninspired. Will Ferrell was on auto-pilot, playing a pompous uncharismatic lead character, who gives us no reason to root for him or like him at all. Christina applegate was terrible. It had some good moments, but over all it just wasn't funny enough. <br />Why does an audience of 2004, give a rats patoot about a woman becoming an anchorman? I know it takes place IN the 70's, but the audience of today doesn't care about those issues anymore. Yet the film used it for its only mild plot device. What a waste.<br />I can't believe this film actually has a script. Ron's team was so over the top. The sports guy was never funny. The guy from daily show, was a waste. Its too easy to throw in a character like that for cheap laughs. The last guy again, not one good joke.<br />I wanted more stories about the rival studios, and less of the crap of a 70's news station getting a female anchor for 90 damn minutes.
B00005JKC3|5.0|I've met peaple that have either loved or hated this movie. I LOVED it! But I am also a fan of the comic and the old 70's TV show. This movie is neither. The closest I could call it is an amalgam of the two with a dash of eastern story-telling. If you saw the previews for it those are only the highlights. This is not a sit you up in your highchair force feed with nothing but action and very little story comic movie. This movie requires emotion and imagination. It is a greek tragedy mixed with comic fantasy. There is a heavy amount of symbolisation that the average man may not get. The script might have needed some tweaking but the acting (yes even Eric Bana whom some of you said was acting stiff but that is actually the Bruce Banner character) did a great job. The effects are mind blowing. I've heard that Hulk CGI was too cartoony....when was the last time you saw a twelve foot tall green guy? In my small and humble opinion (this is the only movie I have ever given a written word about because i feel it needed to be defended) If you are looking for non stop action non emotional comic movie go rent Barb Wire or Batman &amp; Robin  or even Blade 2 (loved it) but if you would like to see a Shakespeare style tragedy with alot of HULK SMASH than give this a try. I guess just like always the Hulk will remain mis-understood.<br />Oh yeah I would love to see a sequel.!
0793518326|4.0|I purchased the book and have no real complaints except for the Harrison/Lennon song &quot;Cry for a Shadow&quot; it was recorded very early on, and yeah sounds easy to figure out, but should have been transcribed anyway.  So it's really not complete among other songs recorded by them.  I have purchased guitar magazines with guitar solos of certain songs  transcribed and one can see every transcriber has a different interpretation of the song including on the Internet.  There is an art to transcribing and some are better at it, I wish I was but it takes a lot of practice.  This book is no exception, but worth the price even though it is not completely complete and there is some discrepancies about it.
0385512104|4.0|While I loved the way in which this book made me reexamine the way I view and percieve the world, I found this book to only tug at me in the most gente way in terms of my emotional involvement and plot intrigue.  I would recommend it but don't expect too much depth.  A lovely beach book, intelligent, but a fast read.
B000002IOJ|5.0|This is one of my favorite thrash metal albums. Everything about it is good.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Donnie Darko is an intelligent but somewhat befuddled teenager who lives with his idyllic family in an upscale American suburban neighborhood, attends an exclusive private school...and has nighttime visions of a huge, demonic-looking rabbit named Frank who gives him information about the future.  Sometimes the nightmarish nocturnal hare puts Donnie into a sleep-like trance and sends him out to perform an act of vandalism or two, and it is during one of these somnambulistic excursions that a massive jet engine from a commercial airliner falls from the sky and demolishes Donnie's bedroom.  Because it appears that Frank has saved his life, Donnie tends to believe Frank's claim to be from the future feels that he must, for the time being, humor the late-night lagomorph.  In the mean time, amid several bizarre events suddenly taking place in his daytime life, Donnie's research into the scientific possibility of time travel leads him to a life-changing epiphany.<br />The ingredients that freshman writer/director Richard Kelly uses to whip up the plot and narrative for DONNIE DARKO (2001) are the familiar materials of everyday life, but he throws in a pinch or two of the bizarre and the absurd to create a subtly skewed and therefore disturbing atmosphere.  The characters are fresh but true-to-life and never formulaic, yet in many of them Kelly still manages to find springboards for satirical comments on diverse societal elements like the American school system, infomercials, spin doctors &amp; public images, the entertainment industry, the popular perception of science, and more.  All of this coalesces into a fascinating and compelling examination of consciousness, perception, and the nature of reality.<br />The film's entire cast is quite strong and handles the deep material with the appropriate degree of earnestness.  Star Jake Gyllenhaal is especially outstanding in the title role.  His Donnie Darko, though emotionally imbalanced, is both an intriguing and sympathetic character, one that engages the absurdities in life--particularly HIS life--with saturnine curiosity rather than fear, and he therefore establishes a perfect tone for the film. Of the supporting cast, Mary McDonnell gives a standout performance as Donnie's mother Rose Darko, as she emotes a genuine concern over the seeming psychological downslide of her son.  The cute and talented Jena Malone also does a wonderful job as Donnie's girlfriend, Gretchen, a young woman who is nearly as perplexed and yet intrigued by life's absurdities as Donnie himself.  In a refreshing departure from the usual hunk and heartthrob roles in which he is usually cast, Patrick Swayze delivers a darkly humorous interpretation of a smarmy self-help guru, and the beautiful Drew Barrymore--also one of the film's executive producers--offers a convincing yet low-key portrayal of an unconventional but popular high-school English teacher.<br />The DVD from Fox offers a very good (some filmic artifacts) digital transfer of DONNIE DARKO in anamorphic widescreen at the film's original aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  The wonderful bonus features include two feature commentaries--one with writer/director Kelly and star Gyllenhaal, the other with various members of the cast and crew--a widescreen video of the film's haunting featured pop song MAD WORLD, deleted scenes, and other cool stuff.  Definitely worth the price of admission, and a disc that fans of more cerebral SF will want in their collections.haracter, one that engages the absurdities in life--particularly HIS life--with saturnine curiosity rather than fear, and he therefore establishes a perfect tone for the film.

B00005AQGH|5.0|Tupac is my all time favorite rapper; hands down. However the the funniest thing about that is there are rappers that have better metaphors and sicker lyrics (Jay-z, Biggie) rappers with better flow (Nas) but only tupac can make you feel him in your chest and your heart. Honestly if im really pissed off it is not a good idea for me to listen to tupac I might do something i will regret. Anyway, Makaveli is the culmination of everything that makes Pac the greatest of all time and puts him in the class of genre and race transcenders like Marvin Gaye and John Lennon. His passion, anger, love, fears, and demons are all vividly displayed in this album. Its so dark and raw that I hate to admit that it his best but damn it is undeniable. Anyway I love it its the best.

B00005Y7AW|5.0|I believed for a long time that I was not a Rufus fan. Then I finally spent a little time with this CD, and recognized the folly of my old ways! <br />Though I can see how listeners might get hung up on Rufus' style of vocal delivery, it's worth the effort to deal with it. If you can accept his style, this CD holds great treasures. Rufus has a stunning grasp of melody, and this album is by turns solemn, swaggering, coy and grand. Remarkable from start to finish -- not a dud on the whole disc. Very highly recommended.

B00006IU73|4.0|Being a fan of Porcupine Tree for a few years, I was waiting in anticipation for their first release on Lava Records.  Up to the official release, I read comments from longtime PT fans about how this was the end because PT signed with a big-label so in their eyes that automatically means they've \\"sold out\\".  Nice to know bands aren't supposed to have a decent livelihood in order to please their hardcore fans.    Anyway, after giving In Absentia a listen, I was impressed.  Did it sound a little more \\"mainstream\\" than what they've released in the past?  Perhaps, but the result of this big-label release is that new listeners are now intrigued with what the group has produced in the past, and that's the whole point to signing to a bigger label: produce new music and at the same time have the ability to attract a larger audience that an independent label can't do, and in turn gets them curious about what you've previously done.    Anyway, back to the album itself.  In Absentia definitely has a harder sound.  Steven Wilson has said that he gets influenced by everything around him, and death metal was one of them.  The harder metal sound is evident in songs like Blackest Eyes, Gravity Eyelids, Wedding Nails, and Strip the Soul.  Some elements of what they've done in the past are still evidence such as the track .3, and Mr. Wilson even takes a jab at the music industry itself with the track The Sound of Muzak.    Overall, the album is still far better than much of the bs that comes out of the music world in this day and age.  With so much coming just so it's listenable on MTV, it's nice to see that some groups don't fall into that trap.  Porcupine Tree releasing material in a bigger label is here to stay, so deal with it.  I definitely look forward to their next release.
B000148KK2|3.0|Krall has always seemed to me at her best when whooping through a snappy standard. I was pleasantly surprised however, and more than a little emotional when I listened my way through very eagerly - several times in a row. The material is mature, beautiful, bold, fresh but not light or pop-like. Blues, gospel, country, jazz interpretation, and even a little rock n roll blend to create serious tunes.
B00001R3HX|4.0|After being first exposed to Porcupine Tree music with Stupid Dream and Signify, I decided to go back and listen to some of Steven Wilson's earlier works, and Up The Downstair was the first.  Still at a time in his career where he was basically a one-man band (although future bandmates Colin Edwin and Richard Barbieri contributed a little), Steven Wilson created a terrific album that's spacey, dreamy, and surrealistic.  To me, this album sounds like it was inspired by 2001: A Space Odyssey and the psychedelic scenes where you're traveling in the monolith.<br />Up The Downstair is a very good example of Porcupine Tree's pre-band works, and I would definitely recommend it.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|COULD PASS FOR A TRUE SOUTHERN WOMAN.(I HAVE LIVED IN DEEP SOUTH ALL  MY LIFE..EXCELLENT ACTING. ALL ACTORS PLAYED THEIR PARTS SO CONVINCING  IT WAS AS THOUGH YOU WERE IN 1864.  GREAT DIRECTING/CINEMATOGRAPHY/MUSIC.  THE SEX SCENES ARE VERY GRAPHIC.
B00004T1NA|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I like this album, but maybe I was spoiled by Stupid Dream and Signify and the immediate impact they both had on me, and as a result Lightbulb Sun was somewhat of a letdown.  But it's still well-produced and worth purchasing once it gets re-released.<br />Songs such as the title track, Four Chords That Made a Million, and show that Steven Wilson can write shorter well-produced songs.  Last Chance to Evacuate Planet Earth Before It Is Recycles is an interesting use of banjo, and as others have said an eerie use of Heaven's Gate cult material.  The Rest Will Flow is a nice little track that uses strings, and shows the group is willing to experiment.  PT still returns to his roots with more epic songs like Hatesong and Russia On Ice.  The album also has more harder sounds than the last which seems to be the progression of the group.<br />It's still a nice album that I'm sure will grow on me more as time passes, and a worthy final independent release and swan song for drummer Chris Maitland.
0393325172|4.0|\\"Master and Commander\\" is the first book in the twenty volume Aubrey-Maturin series.  It is in this volume that we are first introduced to Jack Aubrey, a newly made captain in the British Navy.  He is still a young man and eager for his first command.  Aubrey is given command on the H.M.S. Sophie, a much slower ship than Jack had hoped for.  Early in the novel Jack Aubrey meets Stephen Maturin, a surgeon.  They meet at a small concert at a party when Maturin elbows Aubrey in the ribs because Jack was unconsciously conducting the music along with the conductor, and thus annoying Maturin.  Somehow a friendship begins and Jack asks Maturin to join him on the Sophie as the ship's surgeon.  As Maturn is struggling financially and genuinely likes Jack, he accepts.  This begins a great friendship as well as the story of this novel.<br />\\"Master and Commander\\" does not have a plot, in the traditional sense.  It is an in-depth look at life in the British Navy and what life at sea is like, both for the common sailor, but mostly for the Captain.  Patrick O'Brian takes the reader from naval battle to naval battle, through numerous pages on the art of sailing and loads the book up with nautical detail.  There is an incredible level of realism to \\"Master and Commander\\" and the story is well told.<br />There are two ways that this book can be read.  The first is for those with a love of the nautical detail (or those who want to immerse themselves into that level of detail).  The language and detail can be savored, and I'm sure this is what O'Brian intended with the historical accuracy and all the effort that went into creating this novel.  The second way to read this book is for the average reader and this allows for a little bit of skimming and not trying to grasp and fully understand every little detail.  The second reader will probably enjoy the book more this way than should he (or she) try to force through all the detail.  Little, if any, of the story will be missed this way, but it makes the novel easier to digest.  The nautical detail is very heavy and the novel moves at a very slow (though still interesting) pace.<br />-Joe Sherryway, but it makes the novel easier to digest.

0743243307|2.0|I have a problem with abandoning a book before finishing it because I can't give up the hope that there may be something worthwhile at the end. If I were the type to cast an unfinished book aside, I would have done so with Brick Lane. There came a point in the novel when the main character, Nazneen, began attending political meetings, which is perfectly interesting in itself, but the story gets bogged down in the political details and becomes boring. I found myself disliking Nazneen's choices at the end of the book. I also didn't like Nazneen's children. While characters in novels are almost always flawed, these flaws are supposed to endear us to the character. These characters just didn't seem to have enough redeeming qualities to be likeable. The one character I found that I liked was Nazneen's husband, Chanu, who irritated Nazneen, but I couldn't help seeing how good of a person he really was.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I watched most of the series at my Uncle's house this weekend.  <br />This is so unfair, I remember watched this series when it first came out and not being able to understand it because I came into what I thought was the middle of the season.  It was not in fact the middle of the series that was where it really started with episode 2 that was why I was so confused.  Firefly has gained another fan I will be one till I die.  <br />Basic plot is standard-two different factions fight a war one side The Alliance had more guns and ships than the other side the disorganized and poorly armed Independents.  They do not lack for courage but the Independents are forced to give way in the face of superior fire power.  <br /> Six years later those Independents who have the guts have hightailed it to the end of space finding an uneasy niche amongst the smugglers, pirates and other unsavory types that run the different systems.  <br />The series follows the adventures of one of these crews. <br />I don't understand why this show was canned especially when you play the episodes in the order they were meant to be viewed so the plot makes some type of sense.  The people in charge of Fox are idiots, but I guess they had to make room for Joe Millionaire 25 <br />Trust me any of you that had a problem with this series when it was aired because the episodes were being aired out of sequence are not alone.  I urge you to buy the DVD and may your experience with this fresh, original and unjustifiably canceled show be as positive as mine was  <br />Overall-I hope the Firefly will be the Star Trek of the 21st century, but it probably will not be because there is no justice in the world.  <br />Remember guys &quot;You can't take the Sky from me&quot;  <BR>(been dying to say that)

B00007KQA3|2.0|I've seen the VHS version a dozen times, and waited a LONG time to get my hands on the DVD. Well, I finally saw it two days ago.<br />I regret to say, I'm glad I only rented it.<br />In short, the DVD version of this film is completely, utterly LIFELESS. Not boring, but passionless and without the vitality of the original. I suspect it is a combination of the inappropriately bright, clear colors (not suggestively muted and washed-out as in the VHS) and the new, quietly ponderous &quot;serious&quot; soundtrack which is just plain...well...weak. Overall, this version is about as impressive as a good made for TV movie, if that can be called a compliment.<br />Please do not judge Radford's 1984 by the DVD, even if he is reported to prefer this version (something I will NEVER understand). The life has been literally SUCKED from this film. If you can find a copy of the VHS, watch it instead. It is literally a different movie - try it and see.<br />The only good thing about the DVD is the addition of subtitles which do clarify many scenes. That I liked.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|At first listen this album does not seem like much.  It doesn't have the killer singles the wall had.  It doesn't have the experimental sounds of dark side of the moon.  But this album is beautiful, its dark, and it is probably the best thing Floyd wrote.  The unusual song structures, the almost speaking rather than singing, the personal accounts of what Water's has been through, its an album that changes views on more than music.  It tears the world apart and is very relevent to present times.  Where we have come from and where we are going.  If you are going to buy a Floyd album get Dark Side, get The Wall but do not skip this!
B0000089FS|4.0|The 1980s are not known for being a stellar decade in Elton John's career. He was deep into substance abuse, and even while he was working with his top-notch lyricist Bernie Taupin, Bernie's own personal problems wreaked their own havoc on Elton's output, culminating in 1986's LEATHER JACKETS, widely acknowledged as Elton's absolute worst album. Apparently, the acclaimed LIVE IN AUSTRALIA album &amp; tour awoke Elton to the gems of his earlier days, and that along with surgery done to remove throat sores was to help make 1988's REG STRIKES BACK his big splash back into the spotlight. However, these were just baby steps compared to the all-out triumphant return of 1992's THE ONE, Elton's first clean &amp; sober album in ages. But he had to start somewhere, so this might as well be it.<br />While I had long heard that REG STRIKES BACK was near the bottom of Elton's best, I was encouraged to buy it for &quot;I Don't Wanna Go On With You Like That&quot;, which I consider to be one of his best works even from a fallow period in his career. Sure enough, Elton sounds vocally invigorated on this song, growing into the deeper-textured voice that either came as a result of the surgery or just the passing years. Also, while Elton may have been playing more keyboards than actual piano by this time, this song is enough to make one admit that the man could still play! The public seemed to agree for &quot;I Don't Wanna Go On With You Like That&quot; peaked at an impressive #2, becoming his highest-charting hit in over a decade.<br />Commercially, that was perhaps the extent of REG STRIKES BACK's success, although one more single did manage to chart somewhat high. &quot;A Word In Spanish&quot; is another song that Elton's fans don't quite rank high on their lists, and granted, it's not that stellar. But for a love song at a time when Elton &amp; Bernie were starting to see that these guaranteed them hits more than the rockers of yore, &quot;A Word In Spanish&quot; still retains the intelligence of their older romantic songs. The airy exoticism of &quot;Japanese Hands&quot; &amp; lush Beach Boys tribute of &quot;Since God Invented Girls&quot; do a much better job in the ballad department.<br />All in all, REG STRIKES BACK is more scattered in terms of good, presentable songs, with the prevailing atmosphere one of jubilant celebration having come back from the brink (though Elton had just begun), explaining the emphasis on rhythm. &quot;Mona Lisas &amp; Mad Hatters [Part Two]&quot; is a much more syncopated number than its prequel of 15 years before, but lyrically, it's a fine way of updating the tune from a man who had indeed grown a lot in the years since.<br />&quot;Goodbye Marlon Brando&quot; (an all-too-apropos title recently) is a frenzied, funny way of bidding farewell to the excessive 1980s, which Elton is maybe the first to admit at being an active participant in (just look at the album cover). Although I'm not sure you could count off all the defining characteristics of the decade in just 3 1/2 minutes.<br />&quot;The Camera Never Lies&quot; is another uptempo &quot;anti-love&quot; song like &quot;I Don't Wanna Go On With You Like That&quot;, but with a more unsettling subtext, one hinting at voyeurism with the whole camera motif. On the other hand, &quot;Town Of Plenty&quot;, &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot; &amp; &quot;Poor Cow&quot; sound like they're coming from the still substance-addled minds of Elton &amp; Bernie, maybe showing their insistence on words that simply sound good together rather than mean something.<br />The bonus tracks are rather nil on the reissue of REG STRIKES BACK, favoring alternate mixes than lost tracks. &quot;Rope Around A Fool&quot; is the real find with its bluesy atmosphere, and what sounds like a rare time in this period that Elton forsook his keyboards for a good old Steinway. On the other hand, the &quot;piano-only&quot; (but of the remix) version of &quot;I Don't Wanna Go On With You Like That&quot; is another indication that no matter what kind of keyboard he plays, Elton is a wizard. Some people have claimed that the remix of &quot;I Don't Wanna Go On With You Like That&quot; is an improvement over the original, which I think is a stretch. Rather, it's equally good &amp; comparable, Shep Pettibone giving it a distinctly 1980s-kitsch flavor as a knowing wink to the anything-goes mood of the era. The same goes for the recasting of &quot;Mona Lisas &amp; Mad Hatters [Part Two]&quot;.<br />Maybe the 1980s was not the best time to be an Elton John fan for while commercially, he was still moving full speed ahead, creatively, it seemed that train had left the station once Bernie Taupin departed for the first time. Nevertheless, it was admirable that Elton &amp; Bernie realized it was time to get back to business &amp; win back their old fans with the &quot;renewal&quot; of REG STRIKES BACK. Looking back, it was not the ultimate &quot;strike back&quot; that was expected, but it still had enough reminders of the old genius days to give fans hope that a full-scale return was in the works.other indication that no matter what kind of keyboard he plays, Elton is a wizard.

0671578855|5.0|For fans of Ms. Bujold in general, and her highly popular character Miles Vorkosigan in particular, this book takes her writing to a new level as we go on a highly entertaining adventure, following Miles Vorkosigan as he wages war against an enemy unlike any he's ever faced before--Love.<br />For those unfamiliar with this series, &quot;A Civil Campaign&quot; is set on the planet Barrayar, a conservative, militaristic society with a turbulent past. It's slowly being transformed into a modern, liberal society, much of which is caused by Miles' mother, Cordelia Naismith, who comes from the highly liberal society of Beta Colony. The relationship that formed over thirty years ago between her and Miles' father, Aral Vorkosigan, the legendary war hero often referred to as &quot;the Butcher of Komarr,&quot; resulted in an upheaval that over the years has opened Barrayar's once closed society, a transformation whose growing pains still show today.<br />Miles Vorkosigan is a member of the powerful Vorkosigan family. He's a living example of Barrayar's violent history, having been poisoned while still in his mother's womb. The attack resulted in Miles being being born with many handicaps, including dwarfism and extremely brittle bones. Driven by the desire to live up to his father and grandfather's military legacy, Miles managed to over-achieve, using a combination of strategic brilliance, indomitable spirit, and more than a little luck to carve out his own legacy as a member of the Barrayan secret service.<br />After an incredible galactic military career, Miles is discharged, having survived death itself, but resulting in crippling seizures, a result of being frozen and later revived. He then finds himself grounded on Barrayar, but still highly involved in the inner intrigues of the government, serving as a Lord Auditor, one of the legal justices of the Emperor.<br />After his first task as Lord Auditor in the book Komarr, where he meets Ekaterin. Miles later returns home, and in A Civil Campaign, launches his greatest strategic assault ever, to win the love of the recently widowed Ekaterin, who's currently struggling to find her own identity after years with a domineering husband. Of course, nothing ever comes easy for Miles. In the course of trying to win Ekaterin's heart, they both become embroiled in political intrigue and a wild business venture by Miles' clone brother Mark, who's also pursuing a lady love of his own.<br />This book has romance, politics, humor, and above all, characters that you'll fall in love with in just a few pages. The book stands well on it's own, but if you ever pick this one up, you'll find yourself in the bookstore looking for the rest of the series.

B0000029DD|5.0|Any attempt I have made so far to describe this album to those who have never heard it has fallen far short of the power of actually playing it, but I must try again, I always do... it is not music for the background, or for a party... It is haunting, it is sweet, it is perfect and flawless and yet broken and, at times, heavy with the emotion of a sinner.  Yet also it is light, in songs such as &quot;Hallelujah&quot;, a constant favorite.  Every song is full of various emotions, and they are not simple or wonderously happy.  They are the feelings of one who lived a life, however short, full of misery and yet found a way to leave that behind.  Buckley was different from the rest of us, its true.  Everything he felt was hundreds of times stronger than a normal person should feel.  And yet, his music is not complaining, it is just feeling.  You can adapt the beautiful lyrics and quavering,(perfect) voice to any feeling you may be having, and be immediately lifted by the beauty you hear.<br />It is beauty.  It is perfect.  It is also ironically indescribable.
B00005JLWN|3.0|Equilibrium - an interesting concept. Yes this film may look and perhaps imitate other Sci-Fi movies but its basic storyline is original and thought provoking. <br />Christian Bale is John Preston, a Cleric who enforces the law of no emotion after they were declared illegal in order to prevent further war - achieved by the newly created drug 'Prozium'. One morning, having failed to take his daily dose of it, Preston realises the highs and lows of his new found human emotions and embarks on a new alliance with 'The Underground' and a fight to free the rest of the impassive city of Libria.<br />Some interesting ideas here, yet Writer/Director Kurt Wimmer did not execute them well enough nor expand on their philosophy. Not only that, its intent to be an action film was not fulfilled considering the Cleric's powers revolve around the fictional fighting style 'Gun Kata', it is seldom used. Had there been a few added fight scenes near the beginning and a bigger climatic fight at the end, Equilibrium would have been a lot more entertaining.<br />That aside and considering the rather low funding it had, Equilibrium exceeds as a low budget action film. Definitely worth watching.

B00006CXXU|4.0|Theres no doubt that this girl has pipes, and the material on this album is great, but just to answer a review the reason she hasnt surpassed Britney is simply because when it comes to performing there are few if any people that can deliver a performance like Britney does, like it or not it's the truth.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Just had to say there is a reason so many people have rated this<BR>5 stars.  A shame so many people never got to see this program while it was still on the air (including me).  Would have loved to see what else Joss could have done.   Very sad to see it end so soon.   Loveable realistic characters that grow on you from the very first episode.
6301763041|5.0|I have been watching this movie ever since I was 6, and now I'm 15. It's great and the best part is that Johnny Depp is in it. I think he's incredibly hott no matter what he wears. This movie should definately be on dvd. What I don't get is why does Johnny and (Amy) make out in the movie when she is still dating the other guy, lol. But, it's a very cute movie. I think everybody who hasn't seen it yet, should!
B0001AP12G|5.0|This is one of the greatest debut albums of all time along with Snoop's Doggystyle. In a day where rhymes about &quot;getting crunk&quot; and &quot;all my bling-bling&quot; rule the radio waves, Kanye brings some great music. Despite having one to many skits, this is still a dope album because of the great production and witty lyrics. Kanye uses alot of old-school samples along with his soulful beats that give the entire album a great sound. The lyrics deal with serious issues, but are very clever and witty. It almost brought me to tears at times. It also features great guest appearances by Common, Talib Kweli, Jay-Z, Mos Def, and Ludacris. On the albums nearly 13 minute finale, Last Call, Kanye talks about his rise to fame over some beautiful background music. This is some great stuff people, buy it!
B00003CXCT|1.0|How many versions of Star Wars will be released? How many times can you add insignificant special features to the VHS versions before it becomes too much? Lucas... I have always been a Star Wars fan, until Episode 1 that is... Well, really I began to lose interest when you added that horrible shot of Jabba and Han at Mos Eisley... that really sucked. You need to release 2 versions for DVD. 1) with the original theatrical versions, cleaned up and 2) for all of the naive fans who don't understand why the special editions sucked.
B00006V9A0|5.0|I've turned over a new leaf. I love Nirvana and Kurdt Kobane. Their songs have touched me in a way other Nirvana fans cannot understand... in a way that is so blissful and radiant that it could only be described as nirvana. I've reached my peak of enlightenment and come to my final pass. Kurdt's songs like Stain and Gallons of Alcohol Flow Through the Strip have opened by mind to a fertile new ground of alternative music. I hereby denounce Eddie Vedder and Pearl Jam... Green River and Mother Love Bone. All I want is my Melvins and Nirvana. I have the Teen Spirit Kurdt spoke of in Territorial Pissings. I have the power that he had during Clean Up Before She Comes. I live in a dusty dump with a bottle of beer in my left hand, but who cares when you've got the Grunge King, Mr. Squirt Kobayne playing on your $2 turntable? I'll tell ya who: me. I've found my place. I speak the truth. Into the ground and into the dirt. I'll always have on my mind Kurt. Thank You.
B00012FXB8|5.0|I absolutely adore this third Alien movie!! It's my favorite of the bunch and was a brilliant follow-up to the &quot;Aliens&quot; movie and brings the story to a glorious end which I wish was true but was completely ruined by the stupidity of &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; which should never have been made or at least in the way it did. Ripley's character is heartbreaking and the action sequences are awesome. The ending is really depressing but really good!! Forget the negative reviews and get this DVD TODAY!! Peace out!!
0451204530|3.0|Although I am a Ken Follet aficionado and continue to unabashedly wave his banner \\"Best adventure thriller writer alive today\\" this was not his best work, nor his second best work, but it is a good, captivating page turner none-the-less.<br />The momentum builds in the first half but peters-out in the later half, like a roller coaster that almost reaches the pinnacle, but lacks the umph and falls a few feet short of the critical hump. Thus, predictably, this story, like the roller coaster, slides backwards the last part of the novel. The last half is predictable and a bit unsatisfying. If you are a Ken Follett fan then you may find \\"Code to Zero\\" lacking the violence, intrigue and exotic passion (zero zing) that most of Follet's spy thrillers have had (Key to Rebecca - Eye of the Needle - Lie down with Lions). That said, though this was not a one night, \\"burn the midnight oil\\" read, it was a story that I wanted to finish in two nights. \\"Code to Zero\\" is worth the purchase. Recommended.
B00005JMEW|5.0|This film is so entertaining and so cool, a great tribute to 70's Westerns and Martial Arts films. Just watching Uma Thurman in her yellow outfit similar to Bruce Lee's in his unfinished project &quot;The Game of Death&quot; has to bring back memories for Martial Arts movie fans everywhere.<br />The fight things are spectacular, the Japanise anime complements the movie very well, the music is great,even the dialogues are fun to watch, an unusual thing for action movies these days. You can even know that the actors are having a good time playing their roles.<br />Chapter Five called &quot;Showdown at House of Blue Leaves&quot; in which The Bride stalks O-Ren Ishii(Lucy Liu)with the 5,6,7,8's music playing in the background(fun music)and then gets in a sword fight with her gang in order to get to her is the best action sequence I have seen in years. It's fast paced, violent, intense, cartoonish, fun, just great!!.<br />This is not a must see, It's a MUST OWN for every action fan.
B00004NRWH|5.0|This is a very good album, overall. The progression of Nickelback from Hesher to Curb to the State to Silver Side Up and to The Long Road is fairly straightforward. The guitar plaing becomes more complicated and the singing becomes smoother. The latter is not necessarily a good thing, however. The singing on this album is wonderful, it is rough, and gritty and fits the tone of the album beautifully. Lead singer and frontman Chad Kroeger loses this roughness in his later albums, yet his voice is too rough in earlier albums. To me, his voice is perfect on the State.<br />Breathe - To me, Breathe is a very remorseful song. The lyrics seem to be coming out of the mouth of someone who is bored of the life they are living. &quot;Who wins /Well who cares/It always ends up the same.&quot; The singing is rough, of course, and the guitar playing is at its best in this track. Truly one of the best songs on the album.<br />Cowboy Hat - Cowboy Hat is one of the best songs on the album. I dont really know what the meaning of the lyrics are, but Chad's voice is just perfect. The percussion is great, as is the guitar. The opening stanza is probably one of my favorites of alltime. Cowboy Hat is extremely catchy and I think would probably have made a better opening track than Breathe.<br />Leader of Men - Leader of Men, according to Chad Kroeger, is &quot;a song about magic mushrooms.&quot; Before I heard that, I didnt pay much attention to the lyrics. But lines like &quot;Tell your friends not to think aloud/Until they swallow/Whisper things into my brain/Your voice sounds so hollow&quot; are a giveaway. This is an enjoyable song to listen to and I can see why its so popular. It is one of my favorites. Though the vocals are not fantastic on this track, the lyrics are outstanding. &quot;I jumped in to save a girl/It was somebody's daughter&quot; is one of my favorite lines in any song.<br />Old Enough - This is an interesting song. I'm not crazy about it, though it appears to be verypopular. The vocals are very good, as is the guitar, but there is something in the overall presentation of this song, perhaps the combination of the vocals and the guitar playing, that doesnt draw me in. The song is a bit strange, and the lyrics are open to interpretation. This is a good song, though its one of my least favorites on the album.<br />Worthy to Say - Again, according to Chad Kroeger, this is a song &quot;about marijuana.&quot; I like this song well enough. I think the song is about more than marijuana though. Nickelback seems to be discussing a growing crime-rate among youth. This track showcases Chad's vocals, and is really quite good, though personally I just cant seem to get into it.<br />Diggin' This - I dont really like this song. The vocals dont seem to work well with the percussion or the guitar playing. I dont dislike this song so much that I would skip it, and I do sing along with it. The lyrics are very aggressive, and dont really fit the mood of the song: &quot;Did I ask for your input?/<BR>How's the taste of your own foot?&quot;<br />Deep - I'm not crazy about this song either. The lyrics seem somewhat childish, or at least, very immature. &quot;who will be the big men giving some&quot; is just one example. The vocals dont stand out very well, and the whole song is kind of soft and doesnt fit with the rest of the album.<br />One Last Run - I'm conflicted over this track. I strongly dislike the lyrics, but the vocals and guitar playing are very good. When this song comes on, I tend to ignore what Chad is actually saying, and just listen to his voice, and the sound of the music around him.<br />Not Leaving Yet - I like this song very much. There are a number of references to Jesus, and christianity, most very obvious such as &quot;Come lie next to me Jesus Christ.&quot; The singing is good, Chad is at his best here, and the guitar is perfect, and balances very well with the other instruments. This is a fine song, and one of the best on the album.<br />Hold Out Your Hand - The lyrics to this song are actually very short, but send a tough message. The song starts out by mentioning the army, and ends with mentioning childless mothers. The connection here shouldnt be too hard to make. This is a very good song, and I really enjoy listening to it.<br />Leader of Men (Acoustic) - Nickelback is one of the few bands who may be better live then on album. While the acoustic version may not have the harder ending that the album version did, the vocals are rougher and just fantastsic. The guitar playing is perfect and just went perfectly with the vocals.<br />Overall, this is an excellent album. It loses speed in the middle, but only for a couple of tracks. Nickelback is one of my favorites, and so is the State. I highly recommend this album to anyone.
B000024D4R|5.0|not the greatest pink floyd album of all time but a good one at that. if you are a new classic rock listener this is not the floyd album for you, but as you get more into them and you start your collection with dark side, the wall, and wish you were here, this is the fourth or fifth floyd album you should get. both parts of pigs on the wing are so good because of the change from the other songs on the album. dogs and pigs (three different ones) are good long songs and something you will want to shut off if you havent listened to them before, but keep listening because there is a treat in sheep, the best song off this album.
B00005T30L|4.0|Here's an unHollyowood film about life, roles, friendship and departure that transcends most of the trash available on the big or little screen. I saw this on TV last night, followed by the big screen spectacular &quot;Three Kings&quot;. It was more than clear to me which film was about ideas and real life, and which one was a cure for insomnia. I'll talk about the one about ideas and real life.<br />Unlike the Amazon synopsis and Leonard Maltin's opinion, this movie is not about alienation. It is about a cynical high school graduate's attempt to find a niche to fit into when her world undergoes changes she cannot understand. Thora Birch (&quot;American Beauty&quot;) is very good as the high school graduate with a dark view of everything in the world...until she meets milquetoast record collector Steve Buscemi. There is a good deal of cliche in this meeting but it serves to break the holocaust of darkness in her life, which is compounded by her best friend changing roles, her schlemiel father being an empty, vacuous figure in her life, and her indecision about what to do with her own life.<br />Birch focuses on loser Buscemi, trying to improve his lot in life. She successfully helps set him up with another woman, then injects herself in his life in a way to locate her own life when everyone she knows seemingly abandons her. When this fails, she follows the pattern of the only other stable role model in her life, a mentally ill middle age man who sits at a bus stop, waiting for a bus that never arrives. When his bus one day arrives, she decides to take it, too, as the movie ends.<br /><br />This is Birch's final removal from the world, the alienation most critics disucssed. I prefer to think of it as role acceptance, as finding her niche, as getting to a place she wants. This very simple film portrays a reality for many high school kids that come from single parent homes and lack direction after school. It tells a real story in an uncomfortable circumstance. People that enjoy nice neat stories in films will be very distrubed watching this. People whose minds look for meaning in film portrayals will become more involved the longer the movie goes on.enjoy nice neat stories in films will be very distrubed watching this.

B000060P79|4.0|Simple Plan may not be what you call real &quot;punk rock&quot;, but since when did that have to matter? These Canadians can rock in my stereo  any day! They capture the torture of being a teen and the joy at the same time. &quot;I'm just a kid&quot; is the truth about life when it really sucks, and &quot;Addicted&quot; is exactly what the song title is, even if you hate it, your going to end up humming it at the end. So  stop dissing them because their not true &quot;punk&quot;, whatever they are , they rock. And that's all that matters to me. Thanks :D
B00005NB0H|5.0|For the hard fans (as me) of the Who there will be another additional reason for support that statement.<br />This work remains in my memories as one of the most remarkable musical triumphs all the way . The Who certainly were in his creative peaks . The creation of Tommy showed another important facet of this ensemble.<br />My generation , Magic Bus ,or Summertime blues are played with fury and deep histamina . The riffs and the fierec of the guitar runs paralel to the incandescent rhytm and hard drum beat.<br />Don't even doubt. This album is in the top ten list of the rock seventies gems.
B000002UAX|1.0|Come on, what's all the fuss about?   There were much better bands about in the 60s than these 4 dirty looking scallys from Liverpool.    It's a case of the Emperor's new clothes, me thinks.   Depressing isn't the word for this dross.   Then they went arty farty and gave us a white sleeved album.   Thank God for Yoko Ono, she came on the scene and split up this rubbish.   If only Paul McCartney would disappear like all good senior citizens should but sales of dark brown hair dye would plummet.<br />What at load of old rot.   Don't waste your money.   If you're looking for good British 60s music try The Hollies.   Much better and vastly under-rated.
B00007J4SI|5.0|To face the whole Scraibin's piano music is a hard work. Ponti knows this atmosphere better than the most of the pianists. He has recorded all the piano music of Rachmaninov and Tchaikovsky , he plays Medtner and Rimski Korsakov too , so think it about the huge effort this fact demands .<br />The remarkable aspect to discuss is the sense of the span the fevered lyricism , the originality in his proposals and the deep rapport he sustains all around this towering journey .<br />The Etudes (specially the well known No. 8 Op.12, in which Ponti plays the repeats before the coda), Vers la flame , the mazurkas as well as some unknown pieces of the inmense repertoire justify widely your investment. I acquired this set in vynil and I got in December 2003 in CD .<br />If you're really interested for knowing the intimate world of Alexander Scriabin , this set is for you . After you listen this set , then listen Prometeo , the piano concert and his symphonies and you'll be capable of remake the previous concept you had about Scriabin .
B00003CXCT|5.0|Star Wars, or the entire trilogy for that matter, is a bonafide icon of revolutionized movie making and starytelling.  It was a shame that for so long, George Lucas's vision was limited to rotting VHS tapes and filmstrip.<br />The DVD release of the original trilogy has been what I've dreamed of for so long; crystal clear restoration, widescreen format (like Indy, the DVD release is the first we've seen a George Lucas widescreen since the theater), and awesome sound, for the first time released in 5.1 discrete channels.  I really enjoyed the original films, and totally look forward to what the DVD remaster of the Star Wars trilogy will have to offer in quality and timelessness.<br />If you loved the original trilogy, this is worth ever damn penny!  The Indy DVD release was the sample of what DVD restoration would hold (it I was in shock when comparing the rotting filmstrip next to the restored DVD, both in color, image stabilzation, and blemish removal)... and Star Wars will continue that, I can promise you that much!
B00000DHZJ|5.0|This album definitly has a lot of great material, and will appeal to any Jimi Hendrix fan and most other people as well.  Although some may argue about which song should or should not have been placed on this disk, it doesn't really matter, because almost everything Jimi played was good anyway.  Please disregard &quot;seawasp&quot; if you are considering buying this album.  He either has extremely poor taste in music or has never listened to the CD and just writes reviews for fun.
B000065U1N|5.0|What Ridley Scott does with this film, unlike many before it, is that he does not glorify war in any regard... infact, it scolds war.  War is dirty, chaotic, insane, and life changing as portrayed in this film.  Chronicling an event in Somalia, this film also views a military theater almost non-existant in the military genre up until now.<br />Being cast with such A-list people as Tom Sizemore, Josh Hartnett, Orlando Bloom, Ewen McGregor and Sam Sheppard, we find a great deal of attachment to them and their characters throughout the film; well casted and good character development.  There is tremendous loss in this film, both physical and pyschological...and as a viewer I felt every bit of it.<br />Backed by Oscars for Sound Design and Editing, this film shows it.  Everything was carefully edited to provide a real of scenario as can be done on film.  Yes, the film may look choppy or discolored, however this was added in the editing process to make the film feel gritty and nasty like the war itself.<br />I would highly recommend, as it shows a very different viewpoint on war in regard to how much the general public doesn't know concerning our military.  Great movie, if not very intense.<br />I recommend!
B0002234LS|2.0|Not sure why they bothered with this one.  First of all, the story is so similar to The Shining,but without any of the things that made The Shining so great.  King was either fresh out of ideas when he wrote this one or he was working on a tight deadline .... Anyway, Depp is great and the only reason to see this film.  Bello, Hutton and Dutton have extended cameo roles that allow them to really do nothing. As the &quot;surprises&quot; are revealed they become more and more obvious and less and less interesting.  Why bother is the question that comes to mind.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|NOTE: For some reason out of my control it appears this review was posted twice... please understand.<br />Many a time we see soundtracks that sound alike.  This lack of diversity leads to a monotony of soundtrack after soundtrack which in my opinion is very boring.<br />On the contrary, Klaus Badelt nailed the score very well... most refreshing piece of soundtrack I've heard in a very long time.  It's very mysterious, yet magical in its own right.  Beautifully composed and comprised of many different themes heard throughout the film.  The use of more tribal and colonial period-oriented orchestra instead of a standard hollywood symphony or orchestra results in a more organic and natural score, complimenting the film's theme, time period, and overall mood.<br />This soundtrack is rich enough to make you feel as though you are in the film without having to watch the film... very difficult to pull off in my opinion.  I listen to it time and time again any still find it very refreshing.<br />Very awesome!  I highly recommend this as a noteworthy piece of music!<br />Expect more brilliance from Klaus Badelt in Pirates Of The Caribbean 2 and 3!

B00009L1TA|4.0|Besides Identity, Basic is probably one of the best, well-made drama/suspense films I've seen.  Roles were well casted; Samuel L. Jackson always makes a good, hardened army soldier, and John Travolta makes a good investigator who is very quick, nimble, if not full of mystery.  I will admit it has taken a few times to watch to fully understand everything this rich plot had to offer.  I would say my only reason for a 4 was the language... I usually don't mind language, but please take note this film as language-ridden like none other before it.  For me it was a bit too much than what the film really called for.<br />However, weighing everything, this is a good film worth it's money.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|The first thing I must say, flat out is : It's about time / Great concept for an action movie!  Even as a kid, I had to wonder if vampires and the mythical werewolves ever had ... problems with each other.  It's an age old thing, really.  Vampires symbolize ageless, immortal power, sensuality, and dark gracefulness.  They are that element of human nature that is dark refinement, ageless refined, sexually eloquent power.  The werewolf is pure, insane, beastful rage released.  It is that element of human nature that symbolizes rage, brutality, enforcement - aggression and violence.  So it's very cool to have a movie playing off the symbolic equivalents of the differing psychologies of the audience members.  Some people in the audience for this movie are obviously vampiric, others show a wolfish element.<br />It's a great ride, too, with very Matrix-esque action sequences that pull you along at great speed, catapulting you into this \\"underground\\" world.<br />My one complaint was that the \\"wolves\\" are not very... well, wolfish.  They are more like deformed mutants, really!  I was very let down with that, since I was expecting a full, head on contest between real werewolves and vampires.  It's more akin to say that this movie is like the vampires versus the weird mutated humans who don't look wolfish at all.  The sad part is I've seen humans that DO look like wolves (A \\"wolfish\\" grin, etc.) so I think they could've done better.<br />Still, it sure is fun, and a good action ride!  At least they have the vampires right.<br />If you liked this movie, check out these other modern versions of the myths:<br />Jin Roh the Wolf Brigade<br />Interview with the Vampire

This is definately their best with maybe four to five decent tracks! However the whole Radiohead scene/style/sound really bums me out. <br />Do you people like to feel depressed or something! &quot;Hey Doc, I'm too happy, prescribe me something to ease the joy.&quot; Here have this CD, listen twice a day and feel yourself go down and down till your a weedy little wreck!<br />Radiohead are definately better than Coldplay. <BR>I don't like Muse very much but I do enjoy them more than Radiohead. <br />...And Oasis will be remembered over Radiohead anyday! Radiohead will never compare to Nirvana all you wierd folk.<br />.....Future generations are gonna talk about even Metallica before these dudes are mentioned! <br />Sorry son, your favorite band is a pansy band!
6305558167|4.0|The thing to remember about this movie is that it was made in 1981.  By that token, do not expect non stop battle sequences, one dimensional acting and obviously fake computer cg graphics.  This is a movie in the old tradition, in the vein of something like &quot;The Lion in Winter.&quot;  It is not a non stop action epic and takes pride in slowly building up the story according the classical tales of King Arthur.  I like to think of this as a great adaptation in the grand old style.  Bravo.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|ok, so i am really horrible at listening to new cds...i'll buy a cd for just a couple of the songs and only listen to those ones. but this cd was different...i only knew one song on it when i got it and i wasn't sure if i liked it so much. i listened to the cd all the way through once and put it on a loop after that. I had most of the words down after 2 days. I've never done that with a cd before.  The only 2 songs i don't particularly like are belief and crush.  Belief is good, but it is a little slow. Crush is ok, but it's kind of redundant. Other than that, i could listen to the cd for hours and not get sick of it. it's honestly the best cd i've heard in at least 6 months, if not more.
0783226063|4.0|Well.  Time to write a review of this on Amazon.  So many things to say.  A beginning is a delicate time.  Well, lets state the obvious first and foremost.<br /><br />This movie was a flop.  A bomb.  A disaster.  It cost a great deal of money to make and it made almost nothing at the box office.  This was due to a number of reasons.  One, in the early eighties, science fiction was considered very uncool.  So that any young dude in the early eighties worth his salt wouldn't be caught dead going to this movie.  The other matter is that any of those young dudes who DID happen to wander into this movie probably had to wonder just what the hell was going on.<br /><br />Dune is very challenging science fiction that almost might be considered the work of a genius.  It is far more complex and interweaving than the plot for something like \\"Star Wars\\" for example.  By that, I'm not saying that Star Wars was a bad movie, indeed, it was a very profitable one (unlike Dune).  It is just that from my viewpoint, it is incredible that this movie was even created at all, considering the usual attitude of movie studios toward complex plots of any kind whatsoever.  In fact, I would go so far as to venture the guess that this movie being a flop set a standard for one dimensional movie plot lines for years to come.  A movie must make a profit, the dumber the movie, the bigger the profit.<br /><br />Anyway, the point is this movie somehow, against all odds, WAS made.  And the director, to add to the weirdness, was that master of weirdness (the weirding way?) himself, David Lynch.  Right away, Lynch went about \\"weirding up\\" the plot, adding his own eccentric touches (the cheesy sound weapons aren't in the book at all they were put there by Lynch maybe he thought the young dudes would find sound weapons cool).<br /><br />With David Lynch at the helm, production went forward.  It went very well.  Until they ran out of money and time.  This is why the final battle sequence is so wretched.  The editing in particular was done at the last minute and wow, does it stink.  Note how in the final battle the soundtrack changes at a machine gun rate, the trademark of poor editing.<br /><br />Despite it all, it remains the BEST VERSION OF DUNE AROUND.  And for this, I am thankful.  If this movie had never been made, I would never have started reading Frank Herberts novels.  And that, I think, is the real point of any movie version of a book.

B00005JLPK|5.0|I LOVED this film. Selma Hayek embodies Frida Kahlo and, from what I've read in Frida's journals, gives a very accurate portrayal of this gifted and complicated character. Mixing animation--making paintings come alive--was a brilliant touch. I'll watch it again and again especially for the colors, but also in the brief history lessons provided.<br />Bravo!
B00000JLWW|5.0|... but as an account of the ship and its demise... a 2....<br />Here we got a Romeo and Juliet-story on-board the Titanic with a cliche-ridden dialogue-(&quot;I can fly.....&quot;) prologue and epilogue... What Cameron really should have done - STORYWISE - was to let the ship and its passangers speak for themselves...<br />We are not unbeknownst 2 her story, so why mock us Mr Cameron??? As a fiction however; it is great - if on the trashy side. The authency  of the Titanic and production values are first rate. The music by James Horner(and the humming by Norwegian singer Sissel Kyrkjeb?)was a milestone at the time....The photography of the wreck!? - a must-see....
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Jack Black spouts this in the recent film, 'School of Rock', as he sees school kids taking over a bus, and it's funny to many people, but some may scratch their heads. Why? Simply because the image of punk rock today is so distorted. It's albums like this where you really see how trashed the name punk became and what the hell IS punk rock.<br />'London Calling' is a vertebrae for all that is different in the genre so aptly labeled, punk. It has a melodic rock sound, it has reggae/rhythmic vibes, and it's definitely not the same each time around. Strummer Inc. made something that was basically a road sign that took you off the main highway. From the title track forward, the album is a raw slam with lessons and literature.<br />From 'Guns of Brixton' to 'Rudie Can't Fail', I mean, where do you not see difference? When everyone mentions punk and the godfathers behind it, they never mention Bowie, The Who, or even Cash, they always mention the now brothers and siblings of punk, Ramones and Sex Pistols. What makes The Clash so different from them is that this isn't the usual taste of punk, it's rock and roll daring to be different...which is what punk is in general. If everyone's wearing greasy hair, the kid with the hat is more punk rock than the bar chords of today.<br />See that's why 'London Calling' is so exceptional. It's such a farce in today's standards that punk rock is the ridiculous truckers' hats sideways and the shorts all mocked up;in actuality it's a fad that everyone does, contradicting what it is! It's laughable if you know where I'm coming from. In conclusion, punk rock is rare...and it's certainly not what it's called today. You want originality, theory, and difference? 'London Calling' is, no pun intended, your calling.<br />Exceptional is an understatement.
B00009Y3L4|5.0|As for musical-drama concerned... THIS IS IT! The producers of Chicago should have seen this(indeed they did - every major moment in that film is &quot;stolen&quot; from Cabaret) and put REAL musical stars in the film.<br />When u have Joel and Liza u are not let down...  I give flowergreetings to the entire cast and crew... The filmversion of Cabaret has a lot of &quot;new songs&quot;(Maybe This Time, Mein Herr, The Money Song) and the plot follows the 1955-movie &quot;I AM A CAMERA&quot; more than the stage musical. Since then; the Liza-songs have found themselves in numerous revivals of this stageplay since this 1972-masterpiece. The film is still frightening and raw......Trivia: The scene in which Liza meets Marisa they talk about diseases... On video, here in Europe at least, that was cut....
B000002J03|5.0|I've been looking for albums I consider all fives. One of them is rock legend's 'II.' Led Zeppelin, a contender against the more prolific and modest 'The Who', were loud, raw, and action packed. This is the album that delves into this description.<br />The sequel to 'I', 'II' picks up right where their previous debut left off. Songs like 'Ramble On', where the fine, catchy rhythm blasts into the hard paced, loud mouthed Robert Plant are so rocking, you can't stop and think, 'Man, these guys still freakin' rock.' 'Heartbreaker' is another fine example of fine tuning. With the infamous scale that is one of rock's greatest hooks, the song really has you headbanging as if it's raw power is something new.<br />The album has it's moments and it has it's shines. 'Moby Dick' is one of them, but in essence, this is definitely not a studio song. If you want the real deal, buy 'How the West Was Won' and you'll understand. Nevertheless, it's still killer. 'What It Is and What Should Never Be' is such a fine example of different sounds, it's worth the price of the album alone. Along with the overdone, but still medium rare 'Whole Lotta Love', Led Zeppelin 'II' is one of those albums where every song is great and every song can be played over and over...on the same listen.<br />This sits proudly next to 'Tommy', 'Out of Our Heads', 'The Doors', etc in my vinyl collection. On CD, this rests kindly on my dashboard and I'll always put it in. 'II' is better than 'I' in my opinion, and I think you might see it that way as well.
6301967992|3.0|... when u compare it with Rosemary`s Baby, Repulsion and Frantic. But it DOES have its moments...  What really saves this film is the music by Komeda, choreography by Norwegian Tutte Lemkow, the scenary, the make-up, the off-key characters, Sharon Tate and the costumes...  Too often u find yourself wondering what-the-heck this is all about and why doesn`t Polanski move a bit faster into the action??? Still; it`s watchable and I`m glad that so many have found it to their hearts:-)
B0001XTIUO|5.0|Despite having a strange name,Linda Perhacs has a brilliant voice.Mix up Joni Mitchell,Grace Slick, B'ork and what have you got? One hell of an album!&quot;Chimacum Rain&quot; leads you in with a soft Joni Mitchell type song then on the  next track,&quot;Paper Mountain Man&quot;  she explores a more bluesy ,jazzy  and purposly off key rant similar to Grace Slick.Not only can she sing the softest lullaby folky lilt but can mix it up with some hard hitting,slightly political songs as well.If you like the above mentioned artists,buy this album-you wont be disappointed.
B0001ZX0PG|4.0|You know a film succeeds when you don't want to get up and go to the head.  Yes, there's a murder mystery and a psychological study of three men, boyhood friends in a lower-middle-class white neighborhood.  Sean Penn plays an ex-con turned businessman.  Penn wins the Academy Award for his role as this disturbed man with a motive to kill.  I don't think this part's a stretch for Penn.  Murderous jailbirds are his specialty.  Tim Robbins plays a disturbed man under soft skin, and he wins an Oscar.  Robbins always plays that soft-spoken whacko.  There's another stretch.  Kevin Bacon returns to his old neighborhood.   He's the homicide detective a little too wrapped up in neighborhood history.  I must admit, I had no idea who the real killer was till the last scene, but in truth, this plot MacGuffin's too much.  Hitchcock always left discernable clues.  In Mystic River, all the clues misdirect.  When the film was over, I was left with some disappointment.  The mystery was too clever, still, a good one, tense.
B000002H6C|5.0|...And Justice for All is an extremely powerful Metallica album. Released following the death of original bassist Cliff Burton, Metallica finds themselves angrier in this album than perhaps any previous. ...And Justice for all offers up a tapestry of Political violence and Manipulation characterized in amazing riffs and James Hetfield's familar growl. Although the songs are all very long with usually complex structure they still manage to pull you in and keep you listening until the very end. Most Notable for &quot;One,&quot; the haunting metal classic about a solider who lost his arms, legs, voice, hearing, and sight, in World War I. The album also offers the Monsters, &quot;Blackend&quot; and &quot;Harvester of Sorrow&quot; and the bands amazing instrumental tribute to Cliff Burton &quot;To live is to Die.&quot;
0676974562|1.0|Don't get me wrong, I've plugged through War and Peace, the Brothers Karamazov and countless other novels requiring dedication and persistence.<br />This book does not deserve the time, effort, or money to try to figure out what the point of this whole novel is.  It is painfully slow, overly descriptive and incredibly naive in the writing.<br />I made the mistake of buying a &quot;best seller&quot;.  I usually stay away from them for the simple reason that most people are rather lethargic in reading - opting for simplicity over compexity and the mundane over the exciting.<br />If you value your time, don't buy this book.
630289915X|1.0|This movie never won any awards.  It was so bad that the studio could hardly give it away when they first puit it on tape, then they let it be colorized just so they could sell SOME copies of it, and suddenly the big war cry from the Hollywood liberals was -- &quot;OOH!  Save a classic black and white film!&quot;  Baloney!  No one liked this movie when it was made.  No one liked it the 1950s.  No one liked it in the 1960s.  No one liked it in the 1970s.  No one liked it in the 1980s, then SUDDENLY!  -- it's an American classic.  NOT!  It's Communist propaganda about the &quot;evils&quot; of American free enterprise from a guy who made a lot of pinko films but never thought HE should have to live like this &quot;common man&quot; he kept making pictures about.
B0000074FL|4.0|I first got this album on cassette while on holiday in Calafell. It was in the summer of 1990. Right into the opening track Angel Of Death I was blown away by everything - the fury of the music and the great lyrics that blend perfectly. Another great songs include the title track and my fave: Hollywood - great riff, sharp lyrics and excellent drumming by the also underrated Brian Downey. Some Lizzy fans may feel disappointed when listening to either Fats or Mexican Blood but both songs are amusing. A band is not always supposed to sound alike in all songs, right? The players are in top form, and Darren Wharton keys add a nice touch to the music.<br />Don't get me started on the whole TL reunion thing - money grab. I mean, what the hell? Phil Lynott was Thin Lizzy. Does anybody imagine The Stones on tour without either Mick or Keith?<BR>I feel the same about the reformed Thin Lizzy covers band.<br />All in all, a sadly underrated Lizzy effort - read allmusic.com review for details. Don't trust anyone's opinion but yours.
B00000K3G8|5.0|Back when I was a kid, during the 80s, my first love, whom I met at camp, used to write to me long detailed letters of her life, which seemed far more interesting and visceral than my own backwoods existence.  She once mentioned that she liked Talking Heads, a group I'd never heard of but I ran straight out and bought the first cassette by them I could find -- &quot;Stop Making Sense.&quot;<br />I used to go around on my paper route, in the freezing rain, under a hooded sweatshirt, cranking &quot;What a Day That Was&quot; and &quot;Burning Down the House&quot; on my Walkman, chilled to the bone and soaking wet but warmed by the incredibly upbeat rhythms and confusing lyrics.<br />By the time I was finally able to get the movie on VHS, I'd listened to the tape a million times and knew most of the songs.  But I didn't know what the band looked like or what their stage show involved.  Not only was I blown away anew by the Heads, but there were all these other songs I'd never heard.  How, I wondered, could they ever have left &quot;Naive Melody&quot; off the initial album? <br />Anyway, that old first love is long gone, but she turned me on to the Talking Heads before she split and now the album has been reissued with the set-list intact (except for two songs).  This music is caffeine in a bright cold can; it's like waking up and looking out the window and finding snow; it's drier-warmed sheets, and it's also the sound of a Saturday wake and bake, the sound of the first spring-forward Sunday afternoon.  Good sounds.  Enjoy!
078324228X|3.0|This film always kept its focus and Denzel was supurb. The inaccuracies of the movie are to be expected because afterall, this is Hollywood's take. I don't understand why there are so many condemnations of Ruben by reviewers who are taking information from a questionable website. Of course there are documents out there that suggested he is guilty or he never would have been convicted in the first place. Whether those documents are truthful or not should be considered before wasting space on amazon, not giving any commentary on so much as the acting in the film.
B000002BQK|5.0|I've got the Asian of Japanese edition in this case and its so much better. To conclude the album, there are two remixes of HONEY. Both you won't find on a Single release. They are 13)HONEY (SO SO DEF REMIX) and 14)HONEY (DEF CLUB MIX) both good tracks ot level the album which has a lot of ballads on. But still one of my favortie albums from her until now. Give it a try your choice.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This cd i have to say is one of the best cd's i've ever heard. ITs so addicting and very catchy. I love all the songs. Theres not 1 bad song on this album. Trsut me. But im really pissed off at the person from northern indian who keeps posting 1 star reviews. Hes just trying to hide all the good reviews because theres more of good than bad. He doesnt even have the album and if he does how come he never talks about the songs and only about Britney and how he hates her. Hes just jealous cause of all the success shes having. If she sucks then how come 6 of her songs went to no.1 on the worldwide chart. theres Baby one more time, Crazy, Oops I did it again, me against the music, Toxic an Everytime. And Her first three singles from this album went all to No.1 which is amazing. Anywways, Get this album right now because it's jsut amazing. Faves are: Boom Boom, Breathe on me, Toxic, Outrageous, Touch of my hand, MATM, The hook up, Shadow and Brave new girl and Everytime . ok songs are MATM(remix) and Showdown and the only bad song is early mornin. So u better get this album right now and support Britney.
B0001I55OC|2.0|&quot;Timeline&quot; is a textbook example of how a Hollywood action director can butcher a fine sci-fi book by Michael Crichton, who by now must be used to such atrocities (e.g. &quot;Congo&quot;).  Donner wastes no time on the book's careful buildup to the journey back through time to Hundred Years' War France, and introduction to the technology, &quot;transcription errors,&quot; and the corporate Gates-clone who seeks to exploit time-travel as a high-tech business (&quot;Lost World&quot; redux).  Instead, we get a ticket to a rollercoaster, and a rickety one at that.<br />Despite the retread themes, Crichton's book delves into both medieval technology and society which is actually interesting - it sounds good, at any rate.  Needless to say, there was character development.<br />The film largly consists of a 90-minute chase scene through castles and forests, substituting English knights for dinosaurs.  The book emphasized the grace and speed of the better warriors; in &quot;Timeline&quot;, they are just as clunky as the knights in Monty Python's &quot;Holy Grail.&quot;  (About halfway through, I found myself wishing these guys would break out in a song while doing a witles stomp-dance on a table.)  And how the main quartet of characters maneuver skilfully through 14th century customs and language (a major theme in the book) is of course a complete mystery.<br />Look for this turkey on the budget rack.  Why is it so hard for Hollywood to make a decent medeival movie since John Boorman's &quot;Excalibur&quot;?<br />Harmless fun for kids but even they caught the film's many flaws.  Read the book instead (highly recommended).
0316666343|5.0|you can tell &quot;the lovely bones&quot; is a going to be sad just by reading the back.....so is that what you want? to cry? just like you did when you read &quot;where the red fern grows&quot; as a child? i think most people picked up this book hoping and praying that it wouldn't be as sad as it seems- and luckily, it isn't. the whole point of the story is how we can overcome loss, even at the darkest hours of our life. i hope that nobody close to me dies in such a horrible way as suzy did, but i know that deep down i will remember this book. hopefully, it gives light to those people who are overcome with terrible loss, and inspiration to those of us who have been lucky enough never to have had a loved one perish. this book is now one of my favorites, because although not all of the characters are likeable, they all overcome some sort of obstacle.
B000000OQF|5.0|First of all this is probably my favorite rock album, I love every song.  Slash and Izzy's guitar work goes perfectly with Axl Rose's high pitched scream.<br />1. Welcome to the Jungle - An excellent song but overplayed<br />2. It's So Easy - Took me awhile to like this one but now i listen to it all the time.<br />3. Nightrain - One of my favorite songs on the album.  Axl's vocals are perfect on this song<br />4. Out Ta Get Me - Another classic but overlooked GNR song.<br />5. Mr Brownstone - A song about heroin addiction, very catchy lyrics.  The guitar work and drum work at the beginning is great.<br />6. Paradise City - One of GN'R's finest songs.  it really makes you want to bang your head.<br />7. My Michelle - A very dark song about a girl who uses drugs.  Its very sad and very true.  The first line in the song is great.<br />8. Think About You - A love song set to fast riffs, overlooked by many.<br />9. Sweet Child O' Mine - Maybe the best song on the album and one of their most famous songs. I love Axl's vocals on this song and Slash's guitar solo is AMAZING.  This song was dedicated to Axl's then girlfriend.<br />10. You're Crazy - A fun song, but not one of their best.  They redid it as an accoustic version on GN'R Lies but this version is better.<br />11. Anything Goes - Probably my least favorite song on the album but still good to listen to.  There are no bad songs on this album.<br />12. Rocket Queen - I absolutely love this song.  It starts out fast with kethcy lyrics, and then about halfway through the song changes gears into love/friendship song.  I dont know why people dont know this song as much as the others.  Axl Rose does his best vocal job out of all their albums on this song.<br />This is a CD that i reccomend everybody get.   I listen to it everyday and is perfect to drive to.  I would give this album 10 stars.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Few films have been as highly touted or as deeply vilified as The Passion of the Christ, and for good reason. In America and the world today, the divide between those who have taken upon themselves the name of Christ and those who haven't has never been clearer. To believers, The Passion is a painful but ultimately moving depiction of the suffering, death and resurrection of their Savior. To non-believers, it is a violent portrayal of a mythical event.<br />The film itself is well made. As remarked previously, the subtitles are not distracting in the least. Most viewers are familiar enough with the story to figure out who Mary is and who Pontius Pilate is. The cinematography is beautiful in most places and the film doesn't drag on. Theologically, I found the film utterly lacking in anti-Semitism and a bit overly Catholic (esp. in relation to Mary), but Gibson is a devout Catholic and this was his dime, so I was able to move past that. The extra-Biblical material did not detract significantly from the Gospel accounts to the point of concern.<br />That leads to the much discussed and maligned violence of the film.<br />It makes sense that the New Testament goes into little detail regarding the actual crucifixion and scourging. No one of that time needed a description as they likely had seen it first hand on many occasions. The reader of that time knew all too well the horrors inflicted by scourging and the agonizing death on a cross. To the genteel viewers of today, accustomed to stylized violence and gore being fed to them via CGI, it WAS absolutely necessary to show the up close and personal violence, inflicted by one person upon another, to really understand the pain that Christ suffered on our behalf. I doubt I will watch this DVD over and over again, but I certainly think that it bears watching again and I will buy it just to spite those who blindly opposed it without ever seeing the movie.<br />I laugh ruefully at those reviewers who sadly try to make light of the Passion with crude humor. Not because they are funny, but because it is so typical of those who do not believe. I don't find it offensive, but I am afraid God will. He will not be mocked, which I suspect will be discovered to the chagrin of the mockers someday. I find it odd that in a world that so values tolerance above any other virtue, mockery of the Savior of the world is still acceptable.he Passion with crude humor.

B00005JMYG|5.0|This movie was by far the funniest movie i have seen for a very long time it far surpasses movies like scream 1, 2, and 3, mr deeds, old school, and just about every other comedy movie put out in the last 3 years. my advice make a second one
0783226063|4.0|Yes, the movie is weird; yes, they changed a lot from the book, like another movie which shall remain nameless (*cough*&quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;*coughcough*), and yes, it borders on the incomprehensible at times. Still, IMHO, it beats the hell out of the later remake, which is twice as long and half as interesting. The actors in this movie have great charisma, and besides, who can beat Patrick Stewart as Gurney Halleck? I ask you!<br />The main flaw (again, IMHO) is that the &quot;long version&quot; has yet to be released on video or DVD, although it can be seen about once a year on the Sci-Fi Channel. The shorter version is just not enough; write your congressman and DEMAND the full-length extended cut of &quot;Dune&quot;. 'Nuff said.
B000148KK2|4.0|Let me start off with a big BALONEY! to all those who have claimed that Diana Krall has &quot;gone Norah Jones&quot; or maybe that she's under a spell by her new husband Elvis Costello. This is still a SOLID VOCAL JAZZ album from one of the best performers in the world, only with a new twist. I love standards like the next jazz buff, but accusing Diana of somehow &quot;betraying&quot; her genre by including her own songs and those by Tom Waits, Joni Mitchell and her husband is simply ludicrous. Yes, it's a &quot;darker&quot; CD than usual and it's not the usual collection of evergreens, but it also reveals a personal side of this amazing artist: Diana *is* an excellent songwriter and she's capable of infusing her personal style into such diverse genres as country, rock, blues and R&amp;B.<br />I'm certainly not a fan of Elvis Costello (beats me what the heck a vocal master like Krall sees in him...) and I frankly believe he has quite embarrassed himself by trying to tackle jazz singing -- which I honestly deem not suited to his &quot;alternative rock&quot; voice and unimpressive vocal technique -- BUT (big but...) I will definitely give him credit for writing such a deeply touching song as &quot;Almost Blue&quot;, which is my favorite from this CD, together with the haunting title track (co-authored by Krall and Costello), the bluesy &quot;Stop This World&quot; (a Mose Allison song), the ballad &quot;I'm Pulling Through&quot; and the Krall originals &quot;I'm Coming Through&quot; and &quot;Departure Bay.&quot;<br />If you are a fan of Diana Krall (and I'm a BIG fan of her, not to mention a TRUE lover of mainstream jazz), you will definitely appreciate this change of pace, which, I'm sure, is only temporary. I wouldn't mind listening to more songs like these in future productions, besides the classics I so much love when sung by the amazing Diana.
B000002UAX|3.0|I will be the first to admit that I am not an avid beatles fan.  I certainly appreciate their music and contribution to that wonderful institution known as rock and roll.  However, I am not of the school of thought that they are somehow above criticism, or (as a natural progression) that everything they touched turned to gold.  No band has ever had a career like that, and the beatles are no exception.<br />The main problem with the White Album, as I see it, is the narcotics the band was taking at the time of recording.  There is no other explanation for the existence of songs such as &quot;Bungalow Bill&quot;, &quot;Why Don't We Do It In the Road&quot;, and &quot;Everybody's Got Something to Hide&quot;, to cite a few examples.<br />As a friend of mine explained to me, within these two discs resides one solid disc of tunes, which I can accept.  &quot;Back in the USSR&quot;, &quot;I Will&quot;, While My Guitar gently Weeps&quot; and others are among the best of the band's career, and showcase each band memeber's strengths (my personal feelings about Ringo aside...)  Pared down to one disc, the White Album would rank as among the finest releases of the Beatles career.<br />But the album is weighed down by the songs that *wouldn't* make it onto the &quot;one disc&quot;, and it suffers tremendously as a result.  Too many songs are experimental to the point of being unlistenable, drug-induced, or simply nonsensical.  I know some people claim that each song has a greater meaning, they all fit together with a theme the album has, etc.  Well, I don't hear that.  i find myself hitting the &quot;skip&quot; button far too many times to consider this album an all-time classic.<br />Luckily, the band released better material (by way of Let It Be--the original version, not the crap stripped-down version McCartney just threw out there) before they called it a day.  The White Album has it's moments, but it's not one of the all-time greatest, not even by them.
B000065VB0|5.0|Peter Gabriel has always been at his best when he explores his almost existential sense of dread. But it wasn't till his third solo album that he gave the paranoia free reign. While the first two albums seemed more self consciously eccentric, PG3 dropped the quirkiness in favor of characters that were scary and foreboding.<br />&quot;Intruder&quot; sets the stage for the rest of the album. Having removed all the metal percussion from the studio, the forbidding sounds of the drums and the creaking scratch of the piano string remain one of the most frightening introductions to kick off an album. It was also an environment that Gabriel held through the duration of PG3, be it from the alienation of &quot;Family Snapshot&quot; to the slyly political &quot;Games Without Frontiers;&quot; that atmosphere of impending disaster sucks you in.<br />This was also the album where Gabriel discovered the earthy rythms that became central to his future albums. Both &quot;Intruder&quot; and &quot;Not One Of Us&quot; take a significant amount of their edge from these arrangements, and producer Steve Lillywhite knew exactly how to make that kind of percussive sound work in favor of the artist. Perhaps it is best exemplified by &quot;Biko,&quot; one of the finest politically tinged songs of the eighties and one that still holds up well today. &quot;It was business as usual in police room 619&quot; Gabriel informs us, as chants and drums give us a greater sense of place. It's a relatively simple sound with a softly delivered message (&quot;the eyes of the world are watching now&quot;), and brings PG3 to a satisfying and emotionally charged conclusion.<br />The remaster really does make a difference for this CD, and I already consider this Peter Gabriel's high water mark. But it's also the first of three five star recordings, and a great place to start.
B000268QB2|4.0|What a pleasant surprise it was to find this band.  Having read a couple of reviews (not on Amazon, thank goodness, judging from some of what I have read here), I was intriguied by the sound a band with only a keyboardist/bassist and drummer filling up the musical holes would sound like.<br />They sound pretty amazing, actually.<br />This is one of the finest pop debuts I have heard in a while.  In terms of hooks and song arrangements, &quot;Hopes and Fears&quot; far surpasses other &quot;newer&quot; bands such as the Shins and the Strokes (not that I am comparing keane's sound with those two acts.)  While we're talking about &quot;sound&quot;, I might as well get this out of the way.  Of course the Travis-Coldplay references are going to be inevitable.  Any band today which relies on anthemic arranegements, heartfelt lyrics and a preponderance of keyboards is bound to get lumped in with those two bands.  I find the comparisons to Colplay pretty limited, the ones to Travis a little more so.  The one band *I* kept thinking of while going through this CD, and which I am surprised no one else has mentioned, is A-Ha, particularly their later period material.  Both singers have excellent voices and very good range, and the songwriting styles are quite similar.<br />But, anyway, enough of that.  The album, itself, is very good.  Keane isn't exactly exploring new territory here, and their sound may sound juxtaposed with a thousand other bands.  But is that really a bad thing?  There are times when the experimental side of me wants to listen to kid A or something similar, but there are other times when I just want a nice, accessible pop album.  And Keane certainly delivers there.  <br />The songwriting is top notch, with good arranegmetns throughout the verses typically leading to a soaring chorus which leads so many critics to define the band's sound as 'anthemic'.  Muscially, what on paper sounds like a rather sparse arrangement (only two &quot;musicians&quot; in the band, a keyboardist/bassist, and a drummer) ends up sounding loud and quite full, thanks in large part to some excellent production work.  Many of the songs have that certain &quot;hummable&quot; quality that will stay with you long after you have heard the song.  For a band like Keane, that is a good thing.<br />The singer (excuse me for not knowing his name, I don't have the CD accessible to me right now) has a fantastic voice--loud and passionate when he has to be, quiet and gentle the next, along with a wonderful falsetto.  The songs are written so as to show off his impressive voice, and he doesn't disappoint.<br />Some highlights on the album include the opener 'Somewhere Only You Know', 'This is The Last Time', 'Your Eyes open', 'Untitled 1' and the album closer, 'Bedshapes'.  <br />Though the album truly has no &quot;filler&quot; tracks, it does bog down a bit towards the end, and while the pop formula they have is certainly a good one, they would do well to change it up more often as they do on &quot;Untitled 1&quot;.  <br />In all, this is certainly an impressive debut from a band that has been together much longer than this debut album would indicate.  If you enjoy acts such as Colplay, Travis. U2, A-Ha, and others, and have an appreciation for a well-written and well-performed pop song, I highly encourage you to pursue this album.  It's definitely worth a listen.
B0001LJCMK|4.0|I immediately ordered this album after seeing them perform on Conan O'Brian, in part because of the surrealist back-up singers (the girl in the mustache). The title has nothing to do with it ladies and gentleman, I wouldn't go out and buy this album simply because it has your favorite genre in the title. Eagles of Death Metal are in a sense goofy garage rock with rather minimalist chords and funky beats. I really love pretty much every track on the album, but &quot;Bad Dream Mama&quot; sticks out, along with their cover of Steeler's Wheel's &quot;Stuck in the Middle With You,&quot; &quot;Stuck in the Metal With You&quot;... How can one take that seriously?
0618526412|4.0|I have read thousands of books, almost all of the great classics as well as the modern conventional reads and I can say there is classic value to this one. If you are looking for action, there are tragedies and dramatic events but the focus is not action oriented but the insightful psychological views into the characters' pain and lonliness instead. The title is most fitting.<br />  The timbre of the book reminds me of the Old Man and the Sea (Hemingway), Crime and Punishment (Doestoevsky) and is somewhat similar to To Kill a Mockingbird (Harper Lee).<br />  The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter is definitely a classic that is eternally useful as it depicts human nature, pain and dysfunction just as accurately today as in the 1940's.<br />  I also recommend a new book Torn From the Inside Out.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|well...i must admit..a friend wanted me to see this movie and i had no desire to do so.. i thought it looked quite boring and didn't seem like the kind of movie i would enjoy... after a lot of persuasion, i finally sat down to watch it... and let me tell you, i was very glad that i did..from the very beginning i was hooked.. i loved all the characters, the actors played them well.. it was an amusing movie, great visual effects.. and the end was what really got me.. i haven't cried that hard in a movie since i saw &quot;terms of endearment&quot; for the first time... immediately after i watched it.. i took it over to my mother's house and she loved it as well.. i could watch this movie 100 times and not tire of it... i definatley recommend seeing it at least once.... i don't think you'll be dissapointed
B0000797IO|4.0|This movie starts out with an intriguing situation.  Jennifer Aniston plays a depressed Retail Rodeo employee with a pig of a husband.  She plays the role convincingly, making viewers feel the world of a small-town Texas woman.  <br />When she meets a new employee, a disturbed but more intellectual young man, she thinks she's found an escape from her daily drudgery.  <br />From this point on, events spiral downhill and the movie becomes disappointingly predictable.  The element of surprise is lost and viewers are taken on a formulaic ride where predictable consequences come from foreseen actions. <br />It's not a bad movie to watch on those nights when you want something light, just don't expect surprises.
B000060P79|4.0|Ok, so i know loadsa people that hate Simple Plan, i know even less people that like Simple Plan,but they're actually good. I'm not the greatest simple plan fan... maybe the lead singer is immachore,and maybe the songs are immachore too, and yeah he does kinda sound like hes still in yr8 but despite this fact, this cd is worth having, if you like punk. I like nearly all of the songs on this album apart from My Alien, coz thats just crap. Songs like Perfect and One day are amazing songs, even for simple plan. The lyrics are great and can be quite meaningful...i relate to quite a few of the songs.Eventho Im just a kid is an immachore song, i love it! Ok so the theme of this song is quite unoriginal but its my get happy song lol, and the video for it is great! haha. I'd do anything and I'll meet you there are also great songs, i'm not giving this album 5 stars because it isn't that good, altho in my opinion it is an album worth having. If you like punk, give it a shot, also i think the lead singer is kinda fit :s (but im not the only one!!) . . . . . . .
B00008YJHC|4.0|Even though \\"Surfer Rosa\\" and \\"Doolittle\\" get all the praise, this is actually the album I play most. Not that I don't love the others as well, but \\"Bossanova\\" has a sound and flow to it that really works. Alot of the tracks are short but rocking ones, like \\"Cecilia Ann\\", \\"Allison\\", and \\"Hang Wire\\". \\"Dig For Fire\\" is really the only track I remember being popular, and it isn't even the best one. That would be \\"The Happening\\", and for that song alone I will never get rid of this. Overall it's a great disc, maybe not the first one I'd recommend, but a must for the \\"Pixies\\" fan. After one listen you'll be \\"Blown Away\\".
0393324818|4.0|Moneyball reminded me of 1980s-style education theory: throw out everything you know and try everything new. This was an unbalanced piece of journalism. That said, it was interesting. I'd rate the A's way of doing things about 50 percent right. There is a place in the game for &quot;tools&quot; analysis and a place for numbers. Being a Red Sox fan, I firmly believe that Pedro Martinez is a different pitcher before 105 pitches than he is after. I wish Grady Little had consulted that number in October. I do believe that many times a walk is as good as a hit. But Ted Williams walked too much and did not help Boston nearly as much as he would have if he had hit more. In the book, A's managers, coaches and scouts were treated as if they are idiots and there's only a couple of brains, Beane's and DePodesta's. And of all the deals Beane makes, we never hear of the bad ones and when Lewis lauds the deal for Chad Bradford, a reliever who will be out of the game in a couple years, we are not told the player he is traded for, Miguel Olivo, is actually a rising star. The White Sox just traded him for Freddie Garcia, a much better pitcher than Bradford will ever be. The book was good but unbalanced, a piece of hero worship.Too bad Lewis wasn't around last year, when the A's idiotic baserunning allowed the Sox to beat them and Beane whined that if he had $50 million more he's have beat Boston. $50 million more for what, baserunning lessons?
B00008OLIC|4.0|I can never decide if I like this more than &quot;Shout At The Devil&quot;, but either way it's totally awesome. It was also an excellent end to their 80's run. This had numerous hits on it, including &quot;Kickstart My Heart&quot;, &quot;Without You&quot;, &quot;Don't Go Away Mad (just go away)&quot;, and of course the title song. Others are good too though, specifically &quot;Rattlesnake Shake&quot; and &quot;Time For Change&quot;. The bonus tracks on here are all decent, but not good enough to buy this twice for. Overall, this and &quot;Shout At The Devil&quot; are a must, even if you have the &quot;Hits&quot; disc.
B00003CXCT|3.0|Bittersweet because we at last get to see the first three movies in DVD glory- but they remain the largely unnecessarily doctored \\"special editions\\".  Aside from the restoration of the meeting between Solo and Jabba on Tatooine in \\"A New Hope\\", the changes in the special edition are a waste of money and time... others mention Greedo shooting first- but personally, I think the singing muppet at Jabbas Palace in \\"Return of the Jedi\\" best embodies the pointlessness of the \\"special edition\\".<br />One of Lucas' biggest problems with his later films is he does things because he can... big budgets give way to bigger special effects at the expense of a good story. So it goes in the \\"special edition\\" of the original films. <br />And yet, as a loyal fan, I must own it.... truly a legacy of shame :-)
B00006L7XQ|4.0|It's amazing how popular this album became, but that's fine, just more people to love &quot;Johnny Cash&quot;. This 4th of the &quot;American Recordings&quot; albums is as good as the others, though you can hear that his voice is weaker than it was before. His originals here are all excellent as always, especially the title track, however &quot;American 4&quot; is also cover heavy. He does the popular &quot;Nine Inch Nails&quot; song &quot;Hurt&quot;, as well as songs by &quot;Simon And Garfunkel&quot;, &quot;Sting&quot;, &quot;Depeche Mode&quot;, &quot;The Beatles&quot;, and &quot;The Eagles&quot;. As always, he seems to make each song his own. Overall I actually like &quot;Unchained&quot; better, but this and all of his albums are wonderful. It's the sound of cool country.
B00004SCX6|1.0|This CD is possibly one of the worst CDs EVER. At least I can't say It's Britney that's making it awful, because she doesen't write (not surprising, eh?) her own songs. DO NOT BUY THIS CD!<br />Listen to someone like Fefe Dobson, No Doubt or Vitamin C. Much higher quality.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|LOL as much as you diss her with writing over Trash Trash Trash or saying this album does not have 1 good song?<BR>That is impossible. is that why her Singles from this album all went too number 1 in a row in the world chart?<BR>Yeh I thought so....<BR>You people are just jelous of Britney's success and it probley burns you all when you see a young talented women make millions!<br />As for the album this is the best I have ever heard from Britney it is just an amazing album!

B000260R82|5.0|It's been years since I've seen 'Aïda,' but my first production goes back over fifty years and I've seen it too many times to count. My first Aïda was Zinka Milanov; that tells you how long ago it was. And in the movie theater I fell in love with my first sight of Sophia Loren in the Italian filmed version made in the 1950s. She lip-synched to the singing of Renata Tebaldi. I came to this DVD not expecting a lot, but I was, frankly, overwhelmed. I suppose part of that is because it had been so long since I'd seen the opera; it IS one of the great dramas of the opera stage, and like 'Boh&egrave;me' and 'Carmen' (the other two of the ABC triumvirate) it never fails to move an audience (and me).<br /><br />I've always sniffed at opera-goers who tell about their opera-going experiences by talking about the scenery. C'mon, opera is about the music, right? Well, yes, right. But this production from Barcelona's Gran Teatre del Liceu, one of the world's great opera houses, is a spectacular one, and what's more, it's a revival of a mise-en-sc&egrave;ne that goes back to 1945. Here's the story: For many years the head scenery designer of the Liceu was Joseph Mestres Cabanes, the last of the so-called 'Catalan school' of set design. What he and his predecessors had perfected was the art of painting scenes on paper, that's right PAPER, using incredible skill at trompe l'oeil and perspective to make the scenery look, from the auditorium, ultra-realistic. Mestres Cabanes went a step further--his richly detailed sets were painstakingly painted, yes, but they also included fantastic, even surrealistic details that repaid close attention by the audience, and his use of color was uniquely gorgeous. His 1945 production of 'Aïda,' his last for the house, was probably the pinnacle of his achievement (along with an almost equally spectacular 'Meistersinger' of the year before). The production played for a number of years, but the paper sets (which onstage were mounted on elaborate wooden frames) had long since been removed from their frames, folded, and put away. Miraculously, when the Liceu burnt to the ground in 1995, they survived. Set designer Jordi Castellis had the idea of repairing the wear-and-tear flaws in the 60 year old sets and remounting Mentres Cabanes's production. This was done in July 2003 to huge acclaim, and rightly so. The sets for the four acts,  using as many as 120 different planes and layers of paper, are, in a word, astonishingly beautiful and effective. But, enough about scenery ... what about the musical and dramatic values here?<br /><br />This is a conservative production in that there is none of that Eurotrash rewriting of the plot, the setting, the era, or the psychological gist of the piece. The Liceu orchestra and chorus are excellent; I particularly liked the rich voices of the Priests in their scenes. The ballet is expert, although I did wonder why the so-called 'Sacred Dance of the Priestesses' in Act I, Scene 2 was danced by male dancers, however effective it was. Ah, the singers. Verdi is hard to cast these days; we all long for the days of 'real' Verdi baritones, real spinto sopranos, real ringing-voiced tenors. The Liceu measures up pretty well in this regard. It had been years since I'd heard Juan Pons sing, but his trombone-voiced Amonasro is one of the best I've ever heard. Robert Scandiuzzi's Ramfis is a suitably sonorous black basso. The Priestess (my first, would you believe, was Lucine Amara when she was VERY young and long before she graduated to leading roles) is nicely done by Ana Nebot. Radam&egrave;s is sung by a tenor only vaguely known to me, Fabio Armiliato, a fairly young man who is now singing in all the biggest houses. His tenor is just one notch below that of the best, but he manages it well, his acting is excellent and his appearance (he's tall and trim, and has devilish good looks) helps the effect. This is a video of a live performance and he, like many tenors, isn't at his peak for his big aria at the very beginning, 'Celeste Aïda,' but he warms up nicely and by the time of the Nile scene and the Dungeon scene the voice is ringing out heroically; he is also capable of nuanced soft singing. Daniela Dess&igrave; is a known quantity. She has been a leading Verdi soprano for years, and she shines here. Again, like Armiliato, she warms up after Act I and by Act II and beyond the singing is thrilling. Both the duet with Amonasro in the Nile scene and the aria and duet in Act IV are scrumptious, delicately shaded and featuring some pianissimi that gave me goose-bumps.<br /><br />But the big surprise to me, since I'd never heard of her, is the Amneris of Elisabetta Fiorillo. Wow! In Act I there is evidence of a huge voice, but also some control problems. But by Act II and beyond she is simply magnificent. This is a dramatic voice with heft, flexibility, control. By Act IV she is simply stunning, and the audience certainly agrees with me on that. After her scena in Act IV, Scene 1, the audience went nuts.<br /><br />In summary, then, this is the record of a wonderful performance enhanced by the restoration of 60-year-old sets that are themselves real works of art. This may not be Nilsson, Tebaldi, Price, Domingo, Bergonzi, whoever, but it is still thrilling theater.<br /><br />There are subtitles in English, French, German and Catalan. There are an illustrated synopsis on DVD 1 (of 2) and a short documentary on Mestres Cabanes's sets and their restoration. There is no libretto, but the subtitles (in English, at least) are accurate and well-synchronized.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />Scott Morrisonbig aria at the very beginning, 'Celeste Aïda,' but he warms up nicely and by the time of the Nile scene and the Dungeon scene the voice is ringing out heroically; he is also capable of nuanced soft singing.

B00004YZFR|5.0|Everyone shold not be on the Angels ass. They did what they were hired to do - protect the stage from idiots &quot; who shoudn't have been there, zapped out on the drugs some of them could not handle&quot;.There were a few great musical moments at Woodstock, but it was the &quot;peace and love crowd&quot; and the promoters were just money hungry freaks.<br />The Rolling Stones have always had a dark side, and just because a few hippie types couldn't handle the scene, it has gone down as the &quot;end of the Sixties&quot;. Well, my dear friends, the sixties were a time of change, but the rot had set in way before Altamont. I know, as I was there. Where are all the &quot;share the world, wealth, and love&quot; folks now? Sitting in places they protested, greedy and nothing like they were in the Sixties, towing the line like their parents and others they wanted to overthrow then. Greed, greed, greed. That's where the &quot;peace and love&quot; generation is now, not caring about their &quot;bros and sisters&quot;. Power to the people my ass.
B0000666DW|5.0|This is one of the most amazing cds ever!!! the drumming is phenominal and the guitar work is just the same. the only complaint is that the instumental should be longer at the end and more heavier.

B0000TLA9G|5.0|This is an EXCELLENT intro album for anyone who truly loves rock and roll. Guns N' Roses has quite a history-but this reflects the evolution and changing face of rock, doesn't it? The great and unforgettable music, the hard teamwork, the infighting between group members, mistakes with drugs, it's all here. I heard G N' R on the radio before and decided to try them out a bit further when I bought this CD. I'm glad I did! They rock! The first four songs on the album are from their past albums and demonstrate their ability to do hard rock (\\"Welcome to the Jungle\\") as well as meaningful ballads within the style of rock (\\"Sweet Child of Mine,\\" \\"Patience\\"). The band then throws in some great versions of McCartney's \\"Live and Let Die,\\" Bob Dylan's \\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door,\\" and The Rolling Stones' \\"Sympathy for the Devil.\\" I would highly recommend this album, especially for newcomers who want to see all that this band was. Here's hoping they ROCK ON!
0060537639|4.0|Different - it certainly addresses the euro-centric view of world exploration, but there are some parts I found suspect or disappointing.<br />The introductory map professes to be of East Asia in 1421, but it describes Persia as being within the modern boundaries of Iran, and gives modern boundaries to China, Mongolia &amp; the Russian Far East? This fails to represent whatever were the true spheres of influence.<br />Repeatedly Menzies confuses cause &amp; effect. Many of the resultant journeys appear to be based upon the Chinese having prior knowledge of Ocean currents, eg in the Pacific the South Equatorial Current divides, going North to the Philippines and South to Australia. So apparently the fleet deliberately divides itself in 2 - but surely if they did divide, it was accidental, as the hitherto unknown Current flow caught them unawares? <br />They were swept up the Sacramento River from San Francisco Bay at the mercy of the prevailing winds, but then there is no explanation of how did they ever get back again to the open sea?<br />He waxes lyrical about the problems of measuring Longitude, but when he draws his own maps, such as those of the Chinese Island bases across the South Pacific, the maps aren't accurate, eg placing Easter Island some 3,000 miles west of its true position.<br />For a book with such a strong emphasis on geography, spoilt by some sloppy cartography.

B0000020C4|5.0|The 10th Anniversary Gala performance of LES MISERABLES, presented in concert-style at the Royal Albert Hall, drew together a cast of performers from productions worldwide, and came to be known as the Dream Cast for the musical. Colm Wilkinson again plays Valjean, with Javert played by Philip Quast (THE SECRET GARDEN). The lovely Ruthie Henshall (DIVORCE ME DARLING, MISS SAIGON) plays the tragic Fantine and belts out an impressive &quot;I Dreamed a Dream&quot;. Lea Salonga (MISS SAIGON, FLOWER DRUM SONG) is a luminous Eponine and Michael Ball (CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG), the original Marius, returns to the role once again. Judy Kuhn, the original Broadway Cosette, also is in top voice. The comical Thenardier's are played by Jenny Galloway (OLIVER!) and Alun Armstrong (another original cast member). Also back from the original cast is Beverly Klein as the grasping old crone in the &quot;Lovely Ladies&quot; scene. This historic recording is a must-own for LES MIZ fans.
B00024BHTC|5.0|Man, I'm sick of these idiot reviewers.  Don't keep on slamming this band just becuase you don't like them or their style of music.  I bet a majority of these people are 17 year old metal newbies who think they know everything. Who said Nightwish are totally original??  I never heard that before.  I think they are very unique.  I listen to all genres of metal from Black to Prog and Finland's Nightwish blend quality symphonic metal with operatic female vocals.  Finland has a lot of metal bands that have released great stuff over the past few years(unlike the States).  As for the vocals, people who say that Tarja's vocals are bad or terrible are just stupid and ignorant in my opinion (Tarja was classicaly trained!).  I bet these people agree that Britney Spears is a great vocalist!  Come on people, open your minds and not your as**oles.  I'll step off my soap box now.<BR>  <BR>As for Once, so far I've listend to the first 5 tracks and I love it.  To me, it sounds better than Century Child.  I did like that album, but I think they could have done better. A little bit of a let down compaired to Oceanborn and Wishmaster...  I think the use of the orchestra on Once is great and it even reminds me a little of some Alan Parsons Project stuff.  Creek Mary's Blood is a great song and almost epic sounding.  I love the Native American influence.  I can't wait to finish the CD!
B0001AP12G|4.0|This is a pretty good cd. Kanye West does an amazing job of producing the cd. Surprisingly, he's a good rapper. He doesn't rap about what most of the other rappers you hear about do. He talks about parts of his life and reasons for dropping out of high school. My favorite song on the cd is JESUS WALKS. Its an amazing song that is the highlight of teh album. I would give this album 5 stars but I didn't becasue the skits annoy the hell out of me. Theres like 5 and most of them are pointless. I think he's the only rapper on the Roc that can actually make music as good as Jay-Z. If it werent for the skits, this album would be a classic.

0446677450|4.0|I give the book 4/5 only 'cause I'm not rich yet. (lol)To understand this book, you first have to understand how it evolved. Kiyosaki describes the initial writing of the book as being directed towards a pamphlet to supplement the Cashflow board game he had helped create. He started writing and writing, and before he knew it he had a nearly War and Peace sized book on his hands. Then he brought in people to help him cut the book down (I'm summarizing here), and what resulted was a very fun read with some solid ideas that aren't nearly as controversial as critics claim. The book was a little choppy here and there, but as I was saying this was not intended to be a best seller in the manner it has become.Many of the ideas presented in the book and in his &quot;Choose to be Rich&quot; program are pretty conservative, like paying down first your credit card with the highest interest rate, or saving one pile of money for investing, one for an emergency fund, and one for charity, starting with as little as $3 a week total if that's all you can afford.Where he differs from many financial experts is mainly in his love of real estate and the fact that he downplays the notion of a residence as an investment. (He doesn't say it's stupid to own your own home, he simply says that if you want to be rich you have to define assets as investments which generate a &quot;cashflow&quot;. The result of this is that if you are lucky you will eventually escape relying on a traditional job for income. Obviously, paying more and more of your income into your home doesn't generate anything at all until you sell your home.) Another practice he's fond of that seems to generate controversy is his fondness of the idea- beloved by many, many wealthy people- of living off of a small percentage of income and investing as much as possible, playing with it to see just how little you can live off of. (That's something he gets into more in the rest of his programs).

B00005JMUA|2.0|I had seen Kill Bill Volume 1 in theatres and thought it was the very best movie of 2003.  I had been mad that they left me on a cliffhanger in the 1st movie and was so impatient to see Kill Bill Volume 2.  They delayed Volume 2 by about a month and a half and that got me mad.  When April 16, 2004 came, I went straight to the theatre and saw the 1st showing they had for it.  When it was over,  I thought I can't believe that I paid to see that trash.  I watched Kill Bill Volume 1 a lot and liked it every time, but now I can't look at Volume 1 the same because it had a such a stupid and senseless and boring conclusion in the 2nd volume.  If you loved Volume 1 and haven't seen it yet, don't say there wasn't a warning.  This movie will make you wonder how could Quentin Tarantino make such crap.  Oh yeah, if you are expecting an action-packed ultra-violent movie from this trash, look somewhere else because you won't get action or blood from this movie.  There is a whole lot of senseless conversations.  I'm sorry but DO NOT listen to the critics, they don't want to admit that Quentin Tarantino finally made a bad movie.  I know some of you have to finish this tale of revenge, then go see it if you are really anxious to see what happens to Uma Thurman's character.  I'm still really mad that they made the conclusion very bad and boring and stupid.<br />P.S. You might be wondering why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1, well, fine, I'll admit some of the story points in this movie were fitting in and some of the movie was good, but not good enough.  I'll say one thing this movie didn't do it for me and I'm sure it won't do it for you if you loved Volume 1.

0156029065|2.0|After his second novel, the Foucalt's pendulum, Eco said,arrogantly in an interview, that even he writes a trash it will become bestseller. His third novel &quot;the island of the day before&quot; was not as impresseive as the previous two. And Baudilino I think is a failure, though not a trash.<BR>The name of the rose had rich material of Medieval Philosophy. It was a fantastic medieval detective novel disguised in Sharlock Holmes stories. The prohibition of Aristoteles' materialistic writings in those days was fully integrated to the novel and it was one hundred percent pertinent to the story. Foucalt's pendulum was a fantastic novel with generous knowledge about the Templars' Knights with a surprising twist at the end like the name of the rose. <BR>But Baudilino is such a poor novel compared to these. The historical material in the book is not integrated and not really pertinent, most of the time it sticks out and artificial. He tries to connect them but the connection is not genuine. Unlike the first two novels he published, even the third one, it is a slow-paced reading without a thrill. It is a little boring.<BR>Worst of all, there are a few historical mistakes: First I remember, Greek Nikotas (whatever his name was) tells Baudilino about the Chinese silk industry as if it is a miraculuous thing. But Greeks already had the silk industry in those years (if my memory is accurate). The city of Brusa in Byzatium especially was rich of silk industry. Second, in more than three occasions, Eco confuses the Sultanate of Seljuks in Iconium in Antolia with Seleucids which was in Anatolia long time before Seljuks-and had nothing to do with Turks and Islam-. Unfortunately, reading this book was a waste of time for me.

6305014140|4.0|The thing that bothers me the most with Anime from Asia is the sometimes horrible overdubs in English that sound flat and unimaginative. Ninja Scroll (and Princess Mononoke) is an exception.<br />The drawings are as always superb and the story line is as well. This story is about Ninjas in 16th century Japan, but with supernatural powers. REally interesting.<br />It is very graphic and the language is sometimes very coarse, does make it more 'real' in some strange way or another.<br />Really good movie, watch it twice, once in Japanese, once in English and be surprised
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I hadn't seen a movie that I'd REALLY liked in a very, very long time.  This was definitely a psychological thriller.  I know how everyone hates Ashton Kutcher, but you have to admit, he plays a confused person VERY effectively.  I loved how he backed himself into a corner...okay, I won't ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, but just consider yourself warned; this flick is INTENSE on an emotional level.  Everyone can relate to it because everyone has those moments where they think, &quot;If I could just go back and change this ONE thing...&quot;<BR>   I don't think that I've ever seen Amy Smart in any other movies, but I agree with so many of the rest of these reviews in that she was able to perform incredible transitions from character to character as each twist in the story occured.  I could hardly believe some of the changes in her- it was almost like they were bringing in different people to act.  Anyone who ever saw &quot;Monster&quot; with Charlize Theron will understand what I'm talking about.  It was amazing.  She seems like a very talented young actress with some definite possibilities in the future.<BR>   The boys who were playing Ashton Kutcher's character at those younger ages were also VERY good.  I was flabbergasted at how similar they looked.  It's such a pet peeve for me when the younger character looks nothing like the man he turns into; this was a real relief.<BR>   Because of everything that's going on in the U.S. and the world, I see a lot of movies coming out that are just tired attempts to brainwash the American public (anyone who ever saw &quot;Red Dawn,&quot; I'm talking to you)-tons of movies that seem like nothing but good vs. evil on a global scale with that one superhuman hero who is, subtly, supposed to represent the &quot;hero in us all.&quot;  I've become sick and tired of war-time propaganda and teeny-bopper flicks.  It was a refreshing change to have a thinking person's movie hit the box-office.  <BR>   This movie has everything that an intelligent person needs in a movie: a plot that is constantly thickening, well-developed characters, internal strife, taboo subjects, unforseeable twists, excellent acting, fascinating theory, and a subject that will leave you thinking about it for hours on end.<BR>   This was well marketed, and I think it's a shame that a number of critics didn't seem to find it interesting.  I suppose that if movie critics had an education as well as personal taste, they would fare better with the general public.
B000059PPN|4.0|This was the first Lucio Fulci film I've had the pleasure of viewing! I look forward to seeing his other works! The House by the Cemetery hits on all points of a horror movie! It's creepy, eerie and has some awesome killing scenes and GORE!! They don't call Lucio &quot;The godfather of gore&quot; for nothing! The acting? Well, sub-par at best. Plot? Interesting, but not deep. The dubbing well it's pretty bad but who cares it's a great horror film. <br />The Boyle family move from their cramped New York apartment  into an old mansion near Boston so that the father can do some needed research. The new tenants, unbeknownst to them, have a god awful secret living in their basement. A certain Dr. Freudstein has been housed below since 1879 and has kept himself alive by murdering inhabitants of the mansion and using their cells to keep his body going. Gore, horror, and great special effects makes a visit to the House by the Cemetery a killer stay! A knife through the skull, nice throat ripping and slashing, decapatation, and some maggot spewing make for a &quot;pleasurable&quot; movie for the avid horror fan.<br />We all know horror movies aren't supposed to be deep with Academy Award winning acting. If we wanted that we wouldn't be watching this type of film. I can't compare this film to Fulci's other works because I haven't seen any others, but to me this was impressive and one I would recommend to fans of the genre!!

B000002H97|5.0|This cd might be Metallica's greatest album they've made. One things for sure: this is there biggest hit album selling over millions and millions of copies. It's hard to stop listening to it once you here it. The best songs on here are &quot;Enter Sadman&quot;, &quot;Sad but True&quot;, &quot;The Unforgiven&quot;, &quot;Wherever I may Roam&quot;, And last but not least &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot;. Don't delay get your copy today!
B000002AHC|2.0|This was the Byrds swan song as we knew them. The end result of a year and a half of squabbling, and battle lines being drawn, and now it's over. Mind you they carried on for 5 more years under the name, but the spirit wasn't the same anymore. The 2 opposing sides were McGuinn/Hillman vs. Crosby. Going back to the recording sessions of &quot;Younger Than Yesterday&quot; where McGuinn and Crosby argued over what songs were going to be on that album made Crosby get restless, and he starts hanging out with Stephen Stills who's in Buffalo Springfield. By that summer of 67 Monterry Festival arrives, and both groups play in it; Neil Young isn't with the Springfield, so Stills asks Crosby to fill in. That was bad enough as this was something that groups didn't do too much back then, but when during the song &quot;He Was A Friend Of Mine&quot; in the Byrds set Crosby would make a political statement claiming the Warren report in the Kennedy assassination was wrong pushed relations over the edge. The recording sessions prove the group was on the way out. &quot;Artificial Energy&quot; was what the group was going on as things got very childish from missing parts in a Crosby song to where Crosby on a McGuinn song would take over a half hour to tune his instruments. The end result would happen while recording &quot;Goin Back&quot; when Crosby walked out of the studio because his song &quot;Triad&quot; was rejected by McGuinn/Hillman. &quot;Goin Back&quot; was a lame song anyway, and so was most of the material. The lone song that probably made any headway with me was &quot;Tribal Gathering&quot; which was thier last hurrah in the world of psychedelia. The rest was all over the place. &quot;Wasn't Born To Follow&quot; gained popularity a year later in the movie &quot;Easy Rider&quot;, but this is where the popularity of the Byrds ended. McGuinn/Hillman fired Crosby the next day after walking out, and Crosby sued the group, and Columbia records for royalities, and bought a yacht,and Michael Clarke left shortly after that. An ironic twist of fate member Gene Clark came back into the group just in time to see it go up in flames. He finished helping with the recording of TNBB, and did some concerts with them, but left shortly after that. This was an album that just brought an end to one of the greatest rock groups because they didn't want to play together anymore. It's not even worth anything in the bargin bin either.
B000002H6C|5.0|In my opinion this is Metallica's best cd. It's one of the greatest heavy metal cd's of all time: no questions asked. I peed my pants listening to it. How does Metallica make such a kick ass album?! Buy this cd and you will be happy forever! I guarantee!
B000002I2I|1.0|&quot;Well I Woke Up This Morning, and I Got Myself a Beer&quot;. To the common working man that lyric probably ranks up there with the Holy of Holies. I know in middle, and high school it was recited at least once a day. I found it very unispiring. This whole album was uninspiring as The Doors pretty much fell flat on thier butts after the first album. This was rock bottom. The only good song that came from here was &quot;Waiting For The Sun&quot;. &quot;Roadhouse Blues&quot; has a good riff, but the rest is stupid, and &quot;Blue Sunday&quot; is so downhearted that it makes me want to kill myself. The rest is inept at best. Obvious Morrison was preoccupied with his trial that he forgot to make inspiring music.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|Oh man, oh MAN!  What the HELL happened in this recording session?!  When Dream Theater released 'Images and Words,' it changed my life and virtually every recording up to this point had given me nearly as much satisfaction as that recording (minus 'Falling Into Infinity' which I felt was a weak effort overall).  So, for whatever reason, Dream Theater decided to make a recording of every possible scale, time signature, unison run and multi-instrumentalist's solo known to man, all while abandoning virtually any indication(s) of pleasurable song writing successfully displayed on previous releases.  And what bothers me the most is that other reviewers (die-hard fans?) hear loads of notes, heavy guitar crunch, and virtuoustic musicianship, and they immediately jump to the &quot;This is my favorite album EVER by Dream Theater&quot; point of view without truly listening to it.  OK OK, yes, everyone is entitled to an opinion.  Sure.  But, c'mon now.<br />What has kept me interested in Dream Theater all of these years is their ability to display whatever they want musically, all the while writing a good SONG underneath.  The strengths on this CD are 'This Dying Soul' and 'Honor Thy Father' (which has a great chorus and strong lyrics).  Both of these songs come the closest to retaining the classic qualities of a Dream Theater song but fall just short.  The rest of the songs on the CD contain barely any memorable melody lines, very limited melodic chord structures or riffs, and all songs contain gobs and gobs of notes that, in a way, become almost insulting to a listener's ear after a while.  And this is AFTER I've given the recording a reasonable amount of listens (well over 10 or so). <br />I read somewhere recently that Mike Portnoy felt DT &quot;needed to make this album at this point in their career.&quot;  Fine.  Whatever.  But, what I want to know is what in hell do they have to prove, &quot;skill-wise,&quot; that they haven't proven up to now on previous recordings???Any DT recording off the shelf allllllllllready proves that they are at the top of their league(s) on their instruments.  Reviewers and listeners would be foolish to challenge that.  However, this CD did *NOT* have to be made to prove any point at all.  Finally, as it is, many of us know that prog-rock/metal already has the false reputation of not having acceptable &quot;song writing&quot; that the music industry so boldy defines.  It would be nice if the Progressive Captains-of-the-Ship here (DT) would continue to defy that statement, rather than give more fuel to those lighting that statement's fire.

B00003CXCT|1.0|If it ain't broke, don't fix it? Hasn't George Lucas ever come across this phrase? <br />The bottom line is that the additions he has made to these classics simply distract and are an unforgiveable annoyance. That he feels the millions of people who took joy from the original films should only see them covered with digital stucco, well, it hurts. It hurts me. <br />To take a perfect moment within a perfect film: when Luke Skywalker has been told a devastating revelation, he makes a choice and with great dignity steps off into a void and plunges to what he must think is his almost certain death. In the original film, he spirals down, silent. Amazing. Jump ahead to 1997 - Georgie feels like Luke should be screaming like a little girl here. \\"EEEEEEeeeeeeeee!\\" Stunningly bad. <br />I have a laserdisc player for one reason: My original Star Wars films. <br />This orginal trilogy, warts and all, will be remembered through the ages, remembered for magic wrought with rubber puppets and ships made from model kits. That other trilogy? \\"Mesa don' tink so.\\"

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is, quite simply, breathtakingly good.  This DVD set is worth every dollar that you will spend on it and as you watch each episode of this amazing series you will say two things over and over again:<br />1.  This is AMAZING!<br />2.  HOW could FOX have cancelled this?!<br />Where to start?  The first thing that's really impressive about this series is that I haven't been able to find a person that doesn't like it yet.  I'm a NASA engineer and a science fiction geek, so it's no surprise that I like it.  But, my psychologist wife, my artist sister-in-law, my teenage history-buff brother-in-law - everyone loves it.  The second thing I'll mention is the consistent quality of Firefly's episodes.  There are NO &quot;bad episodes&quot; in this series.  Even my favorite Sci Fi series, Babylon 5, had at least a couple of lousy episodes each season.  <br />There are so many other things I could mention about this series - it's visual effects are on par with the biggest hollywood science fiction movies, the costumes and sets are gorgeous, and the actors all believable and fun to watch.  I'll save you the time - just buy the series and enjoy!

B00005JMYG|5.0|for those of you that thought this movie was too \\"silly\\" or \\"ridiculous\\" allow me to remind you that it is a comedy, a genre which generally attempts to make people laugh. i agree that this is not will ferrells best dramatic performance, too many laughs. the movie is remarkably original and ferrell and steve carell (who plays brick tamlin) make the movie themselves. and for those of you that cant take the punting of a stuffed dog, you have a whole other set of problems besides this movie. plus christina applegate is really hot. this movie may not be like your flawless comedies like The Royal Tenenbaums or A Mighty Wind, but for those people who like to laugh and enjoy happiness, this is a good one
B00000JCB2|5.0|Okay, you read my review on \\"Chocolate Starfish\\", now its one step back to Limp Bizkit's prior effort \\"Significant Other\\". This, according to me was the best album Limp Bizkit had to offer till date. Fred, Wes, Joh, Sam and Lethal were inseperably directed their collective talent towards the establsihment of Limp Bizkit as a Nu-Metal Heavy Weight and also find a deeper philosophy in their music, unlike their rather random debut. This was the first time they had an all-star lineup which includes Jonathan Davis of koRn, Scott Weiland of STP, Method Man of Wu-Tang Clan. Here is how the album goes:<BR>01 Intro -- Damn weird and totally Limp Bizkit.<BR>02 Just Like This -- Swingin Hip-Hop beats courtesy of John Otto.<BR>03 Nookie -- He did it all for the Nookie. The flow continues.<BR>04 Break Stuff -- The heaviest song on the album!Anger unleashed!<BR>05 Re-Arranged -- Some people may buy the whole godamn record just for this song. Its the deepest and the most beautiful song that Limp ever made. Fred shows he can sing too, not only that, he can sing beautifully as well.<BR>06 I'm Broke -- Continues where Nookie left last.<BR>07 Nobody Like You -- Featuring Jonathan Davis and Scott Weiland.<BR>08 Don't Go Off Wandering -- Uncanily weird.<BR>09 9 Teen 90 Nine -- Don't Stop! It's 1999 baby! Swing!<BR>10 N 2 Gether Now -- Awesome rhymes dropped by Method Man.<BR>11 Trust? -- Probably doesnt belong on this album, but its there.<BR>12 No Sex -- A rather philosophical song, \\"Dirty Sex!\\".<BR>13 Show Me What You Got -- Another Thank-you song.<BR>14 A Lesson Learned -- Isn't is supposed to be \\"Learnt\\"??<BR>15 Outro -- Sick, and annoying as usual.<br />That's it hope it was useful. Reviews on the rest of the Limp albums coming soon!
B000059LGC|5.0|+++++<br /><br />I watched this 1978 movie of 140 minutes without first reading the 1937 Dame Agatha Christie novel (of the same name) that it was based on.  I'm glad I did this!  Why?  Because it forced me to really watch the movie in order to try and deduce who the murderer was.<br /><br />As a brief synopsis, the movie begins with \\"Jacquline ('Jackie') De Bellafort\\" (Mia Farrow) telling her very wealthy friend \\"Linnet Ridgeway\\" (Lois Chiles) about the man \\"Simon Doyle\\" (Simon MacCorkindale) she has fallen in love with.  Linnet falls for Simon and they eventually marry.  Their honeymoon is on a riverboat (technically called a 'paddle steamer') called the \\"S.S. Karnak\\" that takes then down the Nile River in Egypt. Aboard the boat, besides the three mentioned above, are \\"Hercule Poirot\\" (Sir Peter Ustinov) and his good friend \\"Colonel Johnny Race\\" (David Niven).  There are other passengers on board who all dislike Linnet.<br /><br />Linnet is murdered.  Eventually two other passengers are also murdered.  Poirot has to solve who the killer is.  For both Poirot and the viewer, it's obvious that the killer is no \\"Simple Simon.\\"<br /><br />Who are these passengers?  Besides the five mentioned above, they are as follows:<br /><br />(1) Louise Bourget, Linnet's Maid (Jane Birkin)<br />(2) Socialite Marie Van Schayler (Bette Davis)<br />(3) Miss Bowers (Maggie Smith), Aid to Marie<br />(4) Marxist James Ferguson (Jon Finch)<br />(5) Romance Novelist Salome Otterbourne (Angela Lansbury)<br />(6) Rosalie Otterbourne (Olivia Hussey), Salome's daughter<br />(7) Lawyer Andrew Pennington (George Kennedy), Linnet's uncle<br />(8) Dr. Ludwig Bessner (Jack Warden)<br />(9) Manager of the Karnak (I.S. Johar)<br /><br />Of the fourteen actors mentioned above, Ustinov's performance stands out.  This was his debut performance as Poirot and I feel he does a stellar job being both serious and comical at the same time.  Other performances to look for are Mia Farrow as the ex-fiance and Angela Lansbury as the perpetually drunk novelist.<br /><br />The cinematography of this movie is visually stunning.  We especially get to see the Sphinx, the Pyramids, and the ancient ruins of Egypt.  The costume design is elegant.  The main background music adds to this movie as well.<br /><br />Listen for gags that run throughout this movie.  For example, Poirot is Belgian but is always confused as being French.  One of my favorite pieces of dialogue is where a passenger gets angry at the great sleuth:<br /><br />Van Schayler: You perfectly foul French upstart!<br />  Poirot: Belgian upstart, please madam.<br /><br />As Poirot attempts to solve the crime, we are shown what might have happened.  Unfortunately, there is some unintended humor as Linnet continually gets shot (in the head) as Poirot goes through each possible scenario.  I found this somewhat distracting.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD (which has the movie in widescreen format) has five extras.  I found that the only one that was interesting was about the making of this movie.  It lasts about 25 minutes.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a fun movie, even if you have read the book it's based on!!<br /><br />+++++gela Lansbury as the perpetually drunk novelist.<br /><br />The cinematography of this movie is visually stunning.

B0000AQVCL|4.0|While certainly nothing groundbreaking in originality, \\"Get Born\\" is a refreshing, fun, fine collection of rock/pop tunes. First, the live, raw, recording style is a nice change from the overproduced, multi-track layered digital recordings of the modern technology era. You can actually hear the hum of those tube amplifiers - and that's a good thing. Rock albums should not always be about perfection.<BR>Yeah, you'll hear licks and melody lines you know you've heard before, as mentioned in countess other reviews here. Like no other band has ever borrowed/ripped off the Stones, Zep, Who, Beatles, AC/DC, etc. Right. There's only so much you can do with an A, E, and D chord. But Jet injects enough personality and effort into the performances to make \\"Get Born\\" more than just a clone album. <BR>What surprised me was the diversity of this album. The two singles \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\\" and \\"Cold Hard B****\\" (GREAT riff) had me expecting a CD full of the same, and that is not the case. The first ballad, \\"Look What You've Done,\\" has Lennon/McCartney all over it. Other tracks remind me of Matthew Sweet and Fastball. Again, a refreshing variety lacking in many albums these days where artists look to be defined and fit into a certain niche. And to be marketed as such.<BR>Overall, this is just a good CD. It rocks. There's melody. A good singer. Guitarists that aren't afraid to play some friggin' guitar. No lame attempts at sounding \\"current\\" with de-tuned guitars, samples, and rap. \\"Get Born?\\" Yeah, if you like good 'ol plain rock and roll, get it, indeed.
B0001MDP3G|3.0|Although the performances were all excellent - it wasn't as great as I thought it would be.  The flash backs were too abrupt and far too often.  I think the story might have been better told differently.  The love story was good and the relationship with Ruby was a hoot but the &quot;war&quot; portion was scattered and not as interesting or entertaining.  It was worth seeing, but I wouldn't watch it again and again.
B000099T2L|1.0|rolling my eyes i dont like this cd it only has a couple good songs on it it is better to buy someone like christina milian who can actually sing she got her spotlight stolen!  just dowload the couple decent beyonce songs  this cd is not worth it. very disappointed.
B000001FN3|4.0|I also owned the original LP version of &quot;Mystery &amp; Imagination&quot;, and picked up the Remastered CD. Outside of Orson Welles' narration the other changes made to the album are so small, as to be unrecognizable. Reading some of the other reviews posted here, one would think Alan Parsons made sweeping changes to the original recording. I simply don't hear it. I like the narrative passages on &quot;Dream&quot; and &quot;Usher&quot;, so really the only noticable change was for the better. The music is outstanding and is routinely my Halloween soundtrack every year. If you have only heard the radio hits by The Alan Parsons Project, you should be sure to pick up this CD. The mood, and tone of the album captures Poe's works perfectly. &quot;Cask of Amontillado&quot; is worth the price of this disk alone. The haunting back and forth by vocalists as one is being sealed alive behind a brick wall will raise goosebumps! This is a truly unique &quot;rock&quot; album that could have only come out in the 70's. If you appreciate good music, either progressive, rock or classical, you will enjoy this CD. Also, I didn't see this noted elsewhere, but &quot;Dream Within A Dream&quot; was used on the soundtrack to Alice Cooper's wonderfully bad Mexican made movie &quot;Monster Dog&quot;.
B00004WGAI|4.0|If you are looking the most accurate adaptation of \\"Jane Eyre,\\" this is it. It's got everything from the book that the screenwriters could pack into four hours.  However, like all of the BBC productions that I've seen, this looks like it was filmed with a video camera.  I absolutely love the book, but part of me also loves film and this is so low budget that there's not really much action or even movement during certain scenes.  People stand or sit in one spot for long periods of time spouting words -- beautifully exact words, mind you -- but it does get quite visually boring sometimes.<br /><br />Speaking of visuals: Timothy Dalton is skinnier and taller than Rochester is supposed to be.  Zelah Clarke is short, but way too filled out and her character is too perky; she is supposed to be outwardly suppressed, though inwardly intense.  And these leads are supposed to be 20 years apart -- Dalton and Clark look to be about the same age.  That being said, there is some great chemnistry between them; the passion between Jane and Rochester -- the focal point of the story -- is absolutely palbable in this adaptation.<br /><br />No other \\"Jane Eyre\\" film will give you so much straight-out-of-the-book dialogue and no other adaptation has the Rochester-as-gypsy scene or an accurate portrayal of the River's family and Jane's relationships with them.  It's definitely worth adding to your adaptation collection.
B00008CLOA|5.0|This album is absolute sonic perfection. Truly an assault on the senses, track by track twisting into something horribly beautiful. I'll never understand the sad lonely little people who give albums like this a negative review - get a job/hobby/signifigant other and leave the computer alone. Seriously, youre not funny and nobody is laughing. How sad. Back to this cd, and the fact that you absolutely must own this... if youre wondering, you owe it to yourself. You wont be dissapointed.

B000001GAM|5.0|The fact that Bruckner never completed his Ninth Symphony never stopped any maestro and orchestra from attempting to master what is perhaps one of the composer's greastest works. The three movements that Bruckner completed are just so magnificent, and the Adagio so ethereal and satisfying at its close, that it seems spiritually complete despite its technically unfinished nature. I have not personally heard any of the sketches and attempted completions of the fourth movement; nor do I necessarily want to. This great symphonic torso stands on its own quite well, I think, and many conductors and music lovers seem to agree with that assessment as well.<br />I will not admit to having heard a great many recordings of this piece. Eugen Jochum's EMI performance was my first exposure to the piece, and Bernard Haitink's 1965 Phillips performance my second. Both were good performances, very dramatic and quite satisfying, but I was always curious about this particular DG recording, especially having heard so many complimentary things about Carlo Maria Giulini's extremely long-breathed interpretation of the work.<br />Well, as it turns out, the hype is richly deserved. This is a glorious performance of Bruckner's great unfinished Ninth, marvelously played by the Vienna Philharmonic (always so good in Bruckner) and conducted by Giulini with great sensitivity and grand vision. His tempos are sometimes slower-than-usual, and yet he hardly ever allows the piece to drag. More importantly, though, Giulini shapes this to be powerfully dark, brooding, but ultimately uplifting work that Bruckner's Ninth must be. The close of the first movement is grandly stark and tragic, the Scherzo (one of Bruckner's most dissonant and savage dances) almost demonic in its power, and the Adagio properly anguished and lamenting until the end, when the Vienna strings and horns lift this music up to the figurative heavens. Maybe you'll even feel lifted up as well.<br />I have no qualms about recommendingthis disc to anyone who is even remotely interested in this piece. Bruckner's Ninth, though incomplete, is one of the great works of the symphonic literature, and Giulini and the Vienna Philharmonic do it full justice.

B0001Z53AQ|4.0|This albums is pretty good.  It's one of those CD's with a few songs that makes it worth buying the whole CD.  This is no Devil's Night, though.  Most of the songs are tight, and the others are okay... I didn't find anything I HATED on this CD...<br />Track 1- Git Up **** 4 Stars<br />Intro is cool.  Fast-moving song with phatass beats.  Eminem is the main singer, and this song suits D12 well.  Love the lyrics on this one.<br />Track 2- Loyalty feat. Obie Trice **** 4 Stars<br />A good song.  I like the feature, Obie.  It's another fast-moving song with good beats.  I like the chorus and overall this song is pretty cool.  The lyrics are cool.<br />Track 3- Just Like U *** 3 Stars<br />Don't pass this one up, despite the annoying children-intro.  A song with a strong message.  Slow-moving with okay beats.  The lyrics are alright.<br />Track 4- I'll be Damned *** 3 stars<br />Okay beats.  Slow-moving.  Not the best lyrics but it's not terrible.  I like the chorus, its tight.<br />Track 5- Dude (Skit) **** 4 Stars<br />Haha... this one's funny.<br />Track 6- My Band ****1/2 4 1/2 Stars<br />This is a fast-moving song with great lyrics and great beats.  Unfoortanutely it's been overplayed... so that's why it's not a 5.  Otherwise the overplaying this song is great.<br />Track 7- U R the One *** 3 Stars<br />I'm not a big fan for alow-moving love songs... which is pretty much what this is.  It's not too bad though.  The lyrics are pretty good and the beats aren't that bad.<br />Track 8- 6 in the Morning **** 4 Stars<br />Medium-pace song with GREAT beats and really tight lyrics.<br />Track 9- How Come ***** 5 Stars<br />Great song.

The background music is cool and the lyrics are good.  I REALLY think the chorus is as tighass as it gets.<br />Track 19- Bugz 97 (Skit) ***** 5 Stars<br />Remember Bugz... a song from Bugz. R.I.P. Bugz.<br />Track 20- Good Die Young **** 4 Stars<br />Intro is good.  This is an okay track.  I like the lyrics and the beats are tight.  Fast-moving song... with a mix of R&B mixed in...

B00005JKJA|2.0|I have read with a bit of amusement the three reviews from IR97, Ageofanxiety, and DSS1744 regarding this movie.<BR>First of all, let me state that this Lynch film simply doesn't completely work.<BR>It doesn't work because Lynch, in  taking his usual pot shots at Hollywood's artifice ( here even more so ), does so in a equally artifical style.<BR>And that is my overriding problem with Lynch; he is a hypocrite.<BR>His most innovative work remains Eraserhead. The only films of his that have really worked have,ironically enough, been his more narrative ones.<BR>Even Blue Velvet was candy coated in Hollywood artifice while claiming to be anti artifice.<BR>Mulholland Drive falls in the same trap.<BR>Now, that said; IRS 97 opened up Pandora's Box by sterotyping all who like Lynch and his films into a despicable 'ART' category and pretty much dared anyone who would disagree with him to launch their attacks.<BR>Predictably, they did so.<BR>Ageofanxiety launched his tirade into IRS97 and made some valid points but then resulted into sinking to the aforementioned's level by telling him to go home and watch an episode of Three's Company.<BR>DSS1744 topped him by outright name calling, resorting to labelling IRS97 as being stupid.<BR>Downright rude.As rude as IRS97 was, and perhaps even more so.<BR>IRS97 at least admits he 'didn't get' the film and so if anything, ignorance is a far more accurate term than stupid.<BR>Ignorance can be remedied by simply opening yourself up to those things you don't quite 'get' and the best thing to do would have been to offer a sensible explanation to the reviewer, which I will attempt to do.<BR>Most surreal films are simply dreams and frankly, that is what surrealism is about. All surrealist, from Dali to Lynch are drawing us into their dreams and dreams, of course are not always narrative.<BR>Dali kept a notebook by his bed and would write down his dreams as soon as he woke.<BR>The films of Lynch are similar in that regard.<BR>The most powerful art is rarely narrative. <br />Don't forget that painting was once only allowed to be narrative, but photography 'freed painting' as one of the impressionists wrote.<BR>And that is true. Because blatantly narrative works simply date, whereas non narrative works are often timeless in most regards.<BR>I do agree with Ageofanxiety in that I think Cronenberg is a more valid  surrealist, but I disagree with both of IRS97'S critics in their methods.<BR>Elitism actually used to be a complimentary word. <BR>It still should be.<BR>Now, it is considered a negative word.<BR>But, if one strives to attain elitistic taste, then this is humanly progressive.<BR>And we can say taste doesn't matter, but that is a falsity.<BR>Taste does indeed matter, and attaining the taste of an elitist is indeed a high compliment.<BR>I challenge IRS97 to start studying film. I don't mean simply watching a movie, but study film in the light of film being exactly what it was once called; A MOTION PICTURE. Visual images that move.<BR>You do have an advance on a lot of Americans I have met in that you prefer widescreen. I know of at least five Americans who simply can't abide that 'black box', no matter how much you attempt to explain that they are losing 20 percent of the image without it.<BR>Too, one of the two aforementioned wrote that you watch IMAX films.<BR>I am assuming that most IMAX films are pretty much plotless.<BR>So, that's a start.<BR>You should start by exposing your taste buds to a wide variety of filmmakers and I do suggest quite a few foreign filmmakers.<br />But, purposely begin by looking for filmmakers whose reputaions are 'abstract'.<BR>That is a start.<BR>Now for the other two;<BR>Lynch is hardly worth all the aggresive defense you have given him.<BR>Next time defend an artist with a bit more meat on his bones.<BR>And next time don't resort to stereotyping and name calling.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney Spears has raised the sex-o-meter once again. This time, stepping up to the plate with more provocative lyrics (\\"Monogomy is the way to go/Just put your lips together and blow\\"), and destroying the fine line she walked, between girl next door, and seductive vixen. \\"In the Zone\\" is a disc that pushes the listener, and even Britney herself, into a world where being comfortable with your sexuality is number one. <br />Tracks like \\"Breathe on Me\\" and \\"Touch of My Hand\\" are undeniably perverse, and yet a momentously guilty pleasure. The hip-hop tracks in which Britney attempts street cred are \\"Outrageous\\", which is catchy, but lacks a stronger base line, and \\"(I've Got That) Boom Boom\\", which is an upbeat dance romp, that is sure to make you want to shake what your momma gave you. \\"Toxic\\" is still brilliant, even after all of it's radio success, and \\"The Hook-Up\\" is a raggae-meets-pop-meets-dance track. Britney's vocals are not stand-out on this record, probably because it is strictly a dance CD. However, songs like \\"Shadow\\" (An ode to an unattentive lover) and \\"Everytime\\" (The response to Timberlake's \\"Cry Me a River\\") are raw and filled with expression. <br />Artistically and Musically, this is by far Britney's strongest record. It was not meant to show off her vocals, (which contrary to extremely popular belief Britney DOES possess) but rather, to gain attention of fans and non-fans alike, and show them that Britney Spears dares to be different from her affluent pop competitors, and succeeds.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I've loved the Star Wars trilogy since the first viewing.  I was happy to see Indiana Jones finally appear on DVD, unedited and fully intact.  I was hoping to see a similar treatment for the DVD release of Star Wars.  DVD offers the ability to provide the special editions and original theatrical releases together, but not for Lucas.  He has decided the original versions are no longer relevant and only the (un)special editions represent his true vision.  The added special effects were distracting and looked worse than some of the effects created in the original release.  I will not purchase this series on DVD unless it is made available in it's original format.  For now, I will have to live with my THX mastered widescreen laser disc versions.
0930289234|5.0|Yes, this is an graphic novel, but every page carries every ounce of narrative density and depth that you'd expect from a more text-heavy tome. Frankly, there's so much to say about this work that I hardly know where to begin, so I won't. Instead, I'll just heartily recommend it to everyone--not just my comic geek friends. In fact, I would *especially* recommend it to friends of mine who don't read comics or graphic novels because they think those things are (a). just for kids or (b). not as satisfying as a more traditionally formatted read.
B0000CNY27|5.0|What can I say.<br />Strangely enough, despite the fact that I am a child of the 80s (I was 12 when this movie first came out), I never saw Escape from New York until 6 weeks ago.<br />Then I was hooked. <br />Most people know the story. In the \\"future,\\" (1988, haha) the US crime rate rises 400%. To combat this crime wave, drastic measures are taken. The United States becomes a fascist-like police state, and in 1992 New York City becomes the country's one maximum-security prison to house the worst society has to offer. Sealed off from the outside world by a 50-foot containment wall on all sides, Manhattan Island becomes a modern (or postmodern) Botany Bay. All bridges, tunnels and waterways surrounding the island are mined, and the US Police Force constantly patrols by helicopter, to ensure that no prisoners escape. Criminals unlucky enough to receive a maximum-security sentence are given a choice: be executed or be airdropped into the New York for life to fend for themselves. As the chilling opening narration observes, \\"There are no guards, only prisoners and the worlds they have made. The rules are simple. Once you go in, you don't come out.\\"<br />Into this black pit of despair comes one S.V. \\"Snake\\" Plissken, played by Kurt Russell. A war hero (he won 2 purple hearts, one in Leningrad and one in Siberia - remember, the Soviet Union still existed when this film was made), Snake for unspecified reasons has turned to a life of crime. And at the film's beginning, the Law has finally caught up with Snake, and he is being transported to New York to serve a life sentence for bank robbery when Fate steps in.<br />On the same evening that Snake is brought to Manhattan Island to begin serving his sentence, the President of the United States (played by Donald Pleasance) is on his way to a peace summit when his plane (Airforce One) is hijacked by a terrorist posing as a pilot, and is crashed into the prison. (In today's post-9/11 environment, the hijacking scene, at least tome, is particularly chilling and I have a hard time watching it). <br />Miraculously, the President exits the plane via his special \\"escape pod\\" and he survives the plane crash...only to be taken captive by the \\"Duke of New York,\\" played with beautiful understated menace by Isaac Hayes.<br />Police Commissioner Bob Hauk (played by Lee Van Cleef), has an idea: send Snake Plissken, trained combat veteran and specialist at \\"getting in quiet,\\" into the prison to find the President and rescue him. If he succeeds, Snake will be pardoned for every crime he's ever committed in the United States. And just to make sure that Snake fulfills his end of the bargain, Hauk has the prison's chief doctor implant 2 explosives in Snake's neck. If Snake does not return with the President in 22 hours, the explosives will go off, and, as Hauk wryly notes, \\"No more Snake Plissken.\\"<br />So the die is cast. Snake goes in...but will he find the President alive? Even if he finds the President alive, will he get out in time to have the charges in his neck neutralized? Watch it and see.<br />This film is entertaining on many levels. It's an excellently crafted story, complete with social commentary and irony. It's a dystopic vision of what can happen when we trade too much of our liberty in exchange for what we think is security - definitely another resonant theme in our post-9/11 reality. We clamp down on individual rights/freedoms, supposedly in the name of protecting the collective - and leave society's undesirables to prey on each other in an asphalt jungle hell. But then what are we? According to this film, we're only slightly less inhuman than the criminals.<br />And the DVD contains various extras and bonuses which are sure to round out one's Escape from New York knowledge. This includes the documentary film \\"Return to Escape from New York,\\" which details the making of the film. There are also commentary tracks by John Carpenter and Kurt Russell, as well as by producer Debra Hill. <br />Another real treat is the deleted bank robbery scene (the original first 10 minutes of the movie). This scene was cut from the final film because, in Carpenter's words on the commentary track, premiere audiences thought it diminished Snake's character by \\"humanizing\\" him too much. I actually found that humanization to be a good thing, and thought that the Bank Robbery sequence helped to set context for the story.<br />Along the lines of the deleted bank robbery sequence, another potential flaw of this movie, at least in my opinion, is that we never really know much about the characters or why they are the way they are. In other words, there's not much in the way of character development or backstory. For example, we know that Snake is sullen, embittered and in general concerned for nothing but his own self-preservation (though occasionally flashes of humanity do show and when it comes down to it, he does the right thing). But why? <br />I've read that Mike McQuay's novelization of the movie sketches out some history for Snake's character (and for the characters of Hauk, Brain, Maggie, Cabbie and the President as well). It would have been nice to see some of that in the film, with subplots, flashbacks, etc. It would've made the story richer.<br />But, regardless, what is there is great stuff. The cynicism and one-liners will bring a wry smile to your face, especially when they come from good old snarling Snake. Check it out.
1576466671|4.0|Chesterton was a gleefully confessed madman and a genius with language, but he's also very &quot;Johnsonian&quot; in his own way--and by that I mean that much like dear Dr. Johnson he says everything so well ... that sometimes you're so delighted by the prosity that you don't consider the message. I'm less blinded by the textual pyrotechnics than I once was, and I'm less wholeheartedly dazzled by the philosophy than I once found myself ... but it's still an interesting read and it still makes some remarkable so-obvious-you-never-noticed-it observations about life, the universe and everything.<br />The best thing you can say about Chesterton is that you don't have to agree with him to enjoy reading him.
B00005J6T1|5.0|Madonna's self-titled debut came out on July 27, 1983. Madonna wasn't very well known then, and that's an understatement. The album entered the top 200 in early September and debuted at number #190. From there it took over a year for it to reach it's peak. It hit #8 (it's peak) only a couple of weeks before the release of her second album, Like A Virgin. From there it was YEARS before it fell off the chart. At first the album wasn't succesful much, but then Madonna constantly started to perform in clubs in the US and UK making this album very successful. In the UK this album peaked at #6. The album has 8 songs on it and 2 more tracks were added for the remastered re-release in 2001.<br />I. Lucky Star<br />A remake of the classic childrens rhyme. This song is remembered for the video which first showed the world the famous look that is remembered to this very day and began the stuff about her bellybutton, as well as starting the trend of &quot;Madonna wannabees&quot;. The song however isn't that good. This was the 5th single off the album and hit #4 in the US and #14 in the UK 5/10<br />II. Borderline<br />A good song. It's mainly the same as the video version but she also sings some other lyrics that aren't in the video. This was the 4th single off the album and it hit #10 in the US and #56 in the UK. Borderline and Lucky Star were so successful that Madonna moved back the release date of Like A Virgin. 9/10<br />III. Burining Up<br />The best song on the whole album. It has a great beat and it never gets boring. The lyrics here also forshadowed all those controversies that were to come &quot;I'm not the same I have no shame I'm on fire&quot;. This was the 2nd single. 10/10<br />IV. I Know It<br />Out of the 3 songs that weren't singles this is the only good one. The refrain is good in this song. 7/10<br />V. Holiday<br />A truly immortal song. Holiday is the only song that Madonna has performed on every single one of her tours and it's still played on the radio alot. This was Madonna's 1st big hit. It was the 3rd single from the album and hit #16 in the US and #6 in the UK. The IC version is better, but this is also very good. A fun and joyful song that will live forever. 10/10<br />VI. Think Of Me<br />The worst song on the whole album. The music just doesn't attract at all. And the lyrics are bad too. You should skip this song 2/10<br />VII. Physical Attracion<br />Another bad song. The only good part here is a tiny instrumental part that appears twice in the song. 4/10<br />VIII. Everybody<br />The song that started it all. This song got the ear of Sire boss who signed Madonna in while he was in the hospital. This was Madonna's very first single. Sounds a bit dated, but still a great song. 10/10<br />IX. Burning Up (12&quot;Version)<br />Burning Up is the best song on the album and this version males it better. There are more synths in this and it's also extended. You'll probably listen to this one a lot. 10/10<br />X. Lucky Star (New Mix)<br />This is mainly just extended with minor changes. A bit uselessm they should have put in a mix of Holiday instead. 4/10<br />Overall this has good songs, and as time went on Madonna made better music. 9/10
0743243153|4.0|I could have done without the first section of this book (about the first 90 pages). The author essentially informs the reader that his/her lack of proper and appropriate parenting is the root of any and all of is/her adult troubles. The other thing that I dislike is the author's arrogance. At one point he even says that according to his definition he is practicing psychotherapy all the time and therefore feels it ok to bend and break ethical guidelines. Professionals are supposed to follow a code of ethics...that is what separates professions from other jobs. Another annoyance is the author's apparent need to show off his extensive vocabulary. Yeah, that's great that you went to school for 8 years but who gives a f*ck if you know words that are not commonly used.     Having said that...The latter parts of this book are amazing!! I especially like the ending dealing with the subject of grace. The author presents practical knowledge, with examples, of how grace can work in everyday living. I also enjoyed the section on love, in which the author points to the illusion of romantic love and explains how 'falling in love' is nothing more than a fantasy that inevitably fades away. The structure of the book is perfect, an English professor would love it. Mr. Peck states and supports his opinions very clearly and for the most part, he presents opposing points of view as well.    If you can get past the wordiness and the first 90 pages, then you will find some very useful and encouraging information.
B00028U6B8|5.0|Just wanted to offer a different perspective from the &quot;What A Rip Off&quot; writer.  <br />The bonus tracks on this new edition of Volunteers are worth the price alone.  These live versions of Good Shepherd, Somebody to Love, Plastic Fantastic Lover, etc. are among the best ever released by the Airplane. <br />As for Volunteers itself, nothing new needs to be said. Dig it, or don't.
0312319517|3.0|There is no better suspense thriller than THE DAY OF THE JACKAL. It is the prototypical novel that spawned many imitators with few equals. THE ODESSA FILE was another huge success for Frederick Forsyth. However,  in spite of writing other fine books, he has never met with the success of the these two books that are decades old. Perhaps the reason for that is the very style of his writing. There is much historical detail in these books. In fact, the historical details go on for pages and can actually read like a history textbook. Personally I remember using passages from THE ODESSA FILE while writing a report on the holocaust in high school. I properly footnoted the reference but the teacher took me to task explaining that novels should not be used as a source of historical research. This is quite evident in his latest book entitled AVENGER.<BR>     Cal Dexter is a Vietnam Vet who volunteered as a tunnel rat while stationed in Vietnam. His job was to help clean out the vast networks of tunnels used by the Vietcong. This required a certain personality able to withstand living on the extreme edge with danger literally around every corner. One had to be persistent and extremely cautious to survive. Traits that would be ideal for a tracker of missing persons. Cal later went on to become an attorney in New Jersey who secretly takes on jobs requiring him to track individuals and possibly assassinate them. He is now hired by a Canadian billionaire to locate his son who disappeared in Serbia. First he must locate the body then find the person responsible for his death. This man is a terrorist involved in producing a nuclear bomb.  Cal must not only capture this highly guarded man but bring him back alive. One of his unexpected adversaries is the CIA who wants the man free to help them locate Bin Laden.<BR>     The long historical passages, while mostly quite interesting (including extensive descriptions of the tunnel rats), are mostly superfluous to the story and serve to slow down the extensive plot. Therefore it overall fails as a thriller in that the momentum so crucial to this style of book is stopped dead in its tracks again and again. Characters are fairly well sketched and the locale a bit too well described. A very mild recommendation.
B000003NA3|5.0|I bought the master takes CD thinking that was more than enough. A year later, I found it wasnt. I just kept listening and listening and could not get enough. These live recordings are essential, maybe in the top 3 jazz live recordings of all time. A lot ot the tracks are repeated, but dont think that this is boring or repetitive. Trane knew he was being recorded, and was clearly trying to make a strong statement, approaching songs each night from a different angle. Eric Dolphy contribution is essential to these sessions. Probably not the best Coltrane to start, but eventually you will need this box set.
B000294SFW|5.0|This album has it all, heavy riffs, thunderous drumming and kick ass Lemmy bass/lyrics. This is a sampling of the musical depth of the best hard rock band in the world. The songs are lemmy-esque with all the dark humor and conviction of the one and only L.K., the guitar playing is flawless and agressive and of course M.D.'s drumming is superb. Don't think twice about getting this album, do it now and enjoy the best hard metal band in the world.
B0000017CA|5.0|Aicd Bath takes it to a whole new level! Makeing a grate metal album. Theres no way to discribe the art of what this band did. But this album is one of the best musically.From the soft sound of Scream of the Butterfly to the heavy riffs on God Machine the album never gets old. One of the most underated bands ever.They will never get credit they deserve.
B0002DB52M|5.0|If you believe that movies should be first and foremost for entertainment, read no further. Why? Because \\"Dogville\\" is not an entertaining movie by any stretch of the imagination. It's a disturbing, emotional masterpiece. I know this word is overused but I can not give another definition for this film but a masterpiece. As you probably have read in the other reviews it looks like a play, the houses don't even have walls and are just chalk lines on the ground. Strangely enough, that is actually a plus for the movie as it allows the viewer to concentrate his entire attention to the story and the actors' performances. And the lack of walls intensifies the feeling of community which the Dogville residents have (in a sense that everyone is aware what the others are up to) which is very important for the idea of the movie.<br />And talking about acting, here is where \\"Dogville\\" really shines. We have Nicole Kidman who lives up to her great reputation and delivers an awesome performance as Grace, an innocent and seemingly naive woman who hides from some gangsters in the little town of Dogville. Never overacting or taking all the attention upon her (newsflash for some other directors - you can actually show a given character's sorrow and pain WITHOUT making the actor/actress cry all the time, the subtle ways are much better), she totally nails the part. Her face and especially her eyes give a perfect representation of the pure, all-forgiving but at the same time smart woman Grace is meant to be. Kidman is supported by a group of some very talented actors like Paul Bettany, who is nearly perfect as the all-knowing but doing nothing, pseudo-philosopher Tom, Stellan Skarsgard, James Caan etc. The narration is brilliantly done by John Hurt and completes the bleak atmosphere superbly. As usual von Trier manages to make this incredible cast to perform even better than their very high standarts, making watching the movie worthy even if you happen to dislike the story.<br />Anyway,there are a lot of good movies who rely just on the actors brilliance to mask the poor plot. Not the case here. It's a very symbolic and engaging tale, the film is nearly three hours long but I hardly noticed that when I watched it for the first time as it never drags. The ending is very controversial and has kept me thinking about it in the few days since I watched the movie. But not by being unclear and requiring complete attention to details (like \\"Donnie Darko\\", for instance) - it's very clear and seemingly easy to understand but it's really open for interpretations from a moral point of view and can inspire a lot of interesting discussions and thoughts. It has also one of the most unforgettable and thought provoking dialogues I have ever seen on screen followed by one of the best scenes I have ever watched. You need to see it to believe me. In some ways, it resembles a very well written book, unlike the majority of blockbusters today who are more like a badly written comics.<br />From a purely cinematographic perspective, there is the audacity of Lars von Trier to shoot the movie with a hand-held camera. But nevertheless it has some truly breathtakingly beautiful moments despite the lack of proper sets - Grace laying in the back of the truck comes to mind, also natable are he stunning light/darkness changes done without any computer help. The important thing is that it totally works unless you care for the perfection of the vision more than for the idea and message of the film.<br />I was really amazed to see a lot of people who attack the movie as being \\"anti-American\\". That's not the case, it has clearly a lot more to do with the decline of the human society as a whole than with attacking the American way of life. The same events could have taken place virtually anywhere in the world and it would totally make sense.<br />What makes this movie special apart from the philosophical questions it boldly raises, is the level of emotion. I can only speak for myselfbut I have never hated movie characters more than some of those in \\"Dogville\\". They develop all the time and the fast and easy way in which a human being can lose its whole humanity and turn into something deserving nothing but hatred, given the right circumstances and victims, is both very disturbing and realistic.<br />Just see this movie with an open mind. You will probably either love it or hate it, I hope it will be the former.
B00005B36H|5.0|Opiate was good, Undertow was better, Aenima was awesome, but this one surpasses all of them because it is superb! &quot;The Grudge&quot; is an amazing opening track, &quot;The Patient&quot; is awesome, &quot;Schism&quot; is alright. tracks 6-9 are a great lineup. The drums in &quot;Ticks and Leeches&quot; give me chills. &quot;Parabol&quot; and &quot;Parabola&quot; are great and &quot;Lateralus&quot; is my second favorite song on the album. my favorite though is &quot;Reflections&quot; this song took a while to grow on me but i love the way it is put together some of Tool's best are the songs that are 8 min or longer and this one is the best Tool song that is 8 min or longer. Oh yea and I love the instrumentals on this cd
B00005JLXE|4.0|daredevil is a groovy comic book action flick. there's plenty of directorial style that keeps things dark and cool. the opening scene with the n.y. skyline turning upside down and the rat was a great way to invite the viewer into hells kitchen. from that point on it's a roller coaster ride through daredevil's dark world and conscience and it never let me down for a second. i loved spiderman but daredevil is a cool hero all his own too. i'm not into the daredevil comics so i don't know how faithful the movie is to the comics but i do know that the movie is touching, exciting, funny, and just plain fun when taken on it's own red leather terms.
B00000JRTX|1.0|***SPOILERS UNAVOIDABLE***<br /><br />If you're a budding Anglophile then you're liable to fall for this charmless and, quite frankly, mean-spirited film.  A gang of smug friends habitually attends weddings (which they despise) of other friends (to whom they seem indifferent).  Each of the smug friends - apart from two of the men, who are a couple - is single because either their lovers have left them or they themselves are indecisive.  The male-male couple seems genuinely happy together, but they, like their smug friends, cannot refrain from relentless mockery of the weddings no one forces them to attend.  But even the married couples are prompted to wed out of a desperate fear of being alone.  It's all very cynical.<br /><br />And the principal romance is disastrously mishandled.  The hero (Hugh Grant) is a perfect specimen of repugnant insipidity.  The heroine (Andie MacDowell) is a sinister mannequin with nymphomaniacal pretensions.  Likes repel in accordance with the laws of attraction.  In Four Weddings and a Funeral, which boasts a screenplay that should have failed an undergraduate workshop, these two grotesques find each other irresistible.  Several inevitable tragedies arise, most notably the death of one of the men of the male-male couple.  (But he ate pans of sausages for breakfast and was unpleasant to nearly everyone except his boyfriend.  So for me his heart attack was well-deserved.)  This forces what's left of the smug gang to re-examine their smugness and, in a shocking adherence to the law of opposites attracting, they slowly pair off with other friends about whom they had previously been smug.  As for the hero and the heroine, while they are busy not being repulsed by each other it transpires that the heroine is already pre-contracted to another grotesque, whom she marries.  Everlasting loneliness looms over the head of the hero.  So he decides to marry a grotesque whom he had previously jilted.  But before the hero can vow to never again know the pleasure of a single moment's solitude, the heroine arrives to tell him that the grotesque she married was somehow too gruesome for her liking and that she is once more free to not be repulsed by the hero.  Naturally the hero does the right thing and rejects his grotesque bride before witnesses.  By now the twice-jilted grotesque is justified in opening the hero's throat but rather civilly punches him in the face.  Anxieties ensue for the hero but are all for nowt when the heroine reappears agreeing to compromise with him on \\"not being married.\\"  They bring their lips together in the rain and thereby provoke a thunderclap straight out of Rocky Horror Picture Show, a far superior film for which this surely must have been a sequel that lost its way.<br /><br />Absent any other merit this film does have the purely anthropological/sociological value of being set in the early '90s.  So if you find it worth your while to be relentlessly assaulted by women wearing appalling dresses with inflated shoulders and men sporting more than usually floppy haircuts then Four Weddings and a Funeral will be momentarily distracting at best.<br /><br />Otherwise you're better off reading Jane Austen or watching an RSC production.
0446677450|3.0|While this book has it's bright moments and encorages the reader to expand one's thinking, it is simply another book that leads the reader down the path of false hopes.

0780624890|4.0|This is a pretty good film but is not as good as the Buffy television series.<br />The world is secretly under the control of vampires (much like in the Vampirella stories).  Blade was born of a woman who was dying from vampire bite.  Thus he has many of the vampire advantages without the limitations.  He has teamed up with Kris Kristofferson who was also a vampire hunter and has weapon making skills.  Together they are waging a war against the vampires.<br />The vampires are led by a council of vampire family heads.  There are two types of vampires: those born as vampires and those turned from humans by a bite.  The leader of the made vampires is tired of ruling from behind the scenes and is pushing for vampires to take overt control.  The ancient leaders are very wary of such actions.  But the made vampire has a plan for vampiric triumph.<br />Some ancient vampire texts hold amazing secrets but the secret of translation has been lost long ago.  Computers have made it possible to learn these secrets a la Jennie Calendar.  The text reveals the existence of an ancient vampire device that can bring about the Blood God.  It is to this end that the head of the made vampires is striving.  With the sacrifice of the heads of the ancient vampire houses, he can become indestructible.  His plans are carried out and Blade must find a way to defeat him.<br />While this movie has the trappings of vampires and vampire slayers, it is really an action flick with the emphasis on Blade's fighting style.  There really are some very good moves here.  The rest of the film is pretty good but not excellent.  <br />I am usually pretty indifferent to most of Snipe's movies but he seems to be well-cast in this role.  There are many good reasons to see this film but it is on the violent and gory side so be warned.
B00005JKDR|5.0|&quot;Monster's, Inc.&quot; combines a fantastic cast, cutting edge imagination, and a tender storyline into a wonderful, delightful family film . . . it may even cure the nighttime frights of your wee ones!<br />Most of us were scared stiff at some point in our childhood by the spooky, imaginary &quot;monsters in the closet,&quot; usually after we've read &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; for the first time.  &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; plays on that near-universal fear by creating a rational explanation -- monsters live in a parallel universe, connected to ours by closet doors, and they power their land by the energy contained in human screams.  Makes perfect sense!<br />Sulley (the hilarious John Goodman) is a celebrity in Monstropolis as the leading scare-getter for Monster's, Inc.  Sulley is generally a lovable big blue yeti-bear-creature, but he can be quite terrifying.  Blissfully unaware of the terror he unleashes, he enjoys his job.  Basking in Sulley's reflected glory is his sidekick and assistant, Mike Waznowski (Billy Crystal, perfect as ever).  Mike is a lime-green-yellow glob with one giant eye and an even larger mouth.  He helps Sulley get the screams and stay one step ahead of the competition.<br />And the competition is fierce.  The dragon-chameleon Boggs (Steve Buscemi, suitably creepy without being too scary for the kids) is right on Sulley's heels to be the scream champion, and he's willing to go to any lengths to beat his nemesis.<br />All is well in Monstropolis until Boo, a human child, accidentally finds her way through the closet and into Monstropolis.  It seems that as scared as kids are of monsters, the monsters are equally scared of the kids -- their touch (allegedly) brings death and ruin.  (This misunderstanding leads to great comic scenes as X-Files-type HAZMAT crews invade every time there's a kid sighting, usually to the woe of the monster who has seemingly been infected by the kid!)<br />Like all Pixar films, the glories are in the details.  Check out the gentle satire of Hollywood celebrity culture, of mindless bureaucracy, and the perils of romance in the office.  The animation is also wonderful -- Pixar continues to evolve with every picture.  For example, Sulley's fuzzy hair is fully articulated as he zooms through various escapades. <br />The story is fast-paced, with enough jokes to keep the adults laughing . . . which is good, 'cause your kids will likely keep throwing this into the DVD player.<br />Speaking of the DVD -- there are lots of fun extras on this two-disc set.  Personal favorites include the fake &quot;outtakes,&quot; similar to those at the end of &quot;A Bug's Life,&quot; a short film featuring Mike showing Sulley his new hi-tech car (with hilarious consequences), and an Oscar-winning short film, &quot;For the Birds,&quot; which shows how funny animation can be, even in short doses.  There are additional extras that will keep the kiddies occupied for hours.  <br />All in all, a must for the family's DVD library.

0838577016|3.0|This massive book has lots of useful information and informative figures, and the decent index makes it highly likely that you will find what you need.  However, using it as a textbook for a course is a ridiculous thing to do, especially if it's an undergraduate course.  The amount of material is simply overwhelming, and it would discourage students from pursuing a career in neural science.  If you are a neurobiology teacher and are considering using this text in your course, please reconsider.  In my opinion (as a neurobiology teacher), a concise and readable text is far more effective.
B0001US8EO|5.0|I was actually planning to but Wyatt Earp on DVD, but as I already have the Director's Cut on VHS video, I'll wait until the release of it on DVD. I believed this would be the &quot;definitive&quot; video release of Wyatt Earp. I'm quite disappointed!! I would rather have had the complete film on DVD than all of the extras!! Five-stars for the film, one-star for the short-sightedness of this DVD's content!! This is just as puzzling as why the restored version of John Wayne's The Alamo is not on DVD yet, either.
1400032717|5.0|The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time is narrated by Christopher Boone, an autistic 15 year old English boy who lives with his father and his pet rat, Toby. On page one Christopher--who loves animals--discovers the neighbor's dog, dead--killed deliberately and cruelly. At first, he is suspected of killing the dog. He becomes determined--despite his limitations--to discover the actual killer.    In the process he runs into a number of difficulties--expected and unexpected--which, with great courage and insight, he attempts to overcome. He tells his story in a clear, matter-of-fact manner that can be deceptive in that it displays profound insights in childishly simple terms.    Because Christopher is a math whiz, each chapter number is a prime number and there are diagrams of math problems and maps (which he's very good at forming & memorizing) throughout the book.     The story tugs at your heart as you read not only Christopher's poignant struggle to make sense of an over-stimulating world (his \\"favorite dream\\" is one in which everyone except people like him are dead and he can go anywhere without being accosted). The reader views through Christopher's eyes the struggles of \\"normal\\" people to make sense of their lives--which, alas, cannot be solved neatly like math problems.

0679457607|4.0|For the past several years, I've worked tirelessly at golf.  However, my improvement was minimal.  I'd previously read Mr. Gallwey's book but never took it that seriously and basically abandoned his suggestions from this book whenever I hit a bad shot (Self 1 saying &quot;well, that doesn't work!&quot;).  I entered my club championship and I felt that I would play well.  The first day I struggled to an 85, playing the same way I had for the past few years (decent golf swing but no results).  The next day, I came in with zero expectations and told myself that I would trust &quot;Self 2&quot; to play the game.  The result was a 70, my first competitive round under 80, let alone under par!  <BR>In summary, combine a firm grasp of the fundamentals (I find that Mr. Gallwey's learning method works well here) with the mental attitude that he stresses in this book, and you will be very happy playing this game.
1592400876|4.0|A very cute read for those who appreciate proper writing. At first (even with my Library Science degree) I was a little confused by some of the puncutation until I realized the author-ess was British. Lynne is charmingly witty, and I will revisit her book time and time again.  <br />The appalling state of grammar and spelling in this country struck me about 20 years ago, when I drove up the long driveway to a riding stable which advertised, &quot;Horse's for livery, Horse's for lessons, Horse's boarded.&quot; Then there was this badly painted picture of a smiling horse. I couldn't stop laughing.  <br />I wish I'd thought of writing this book! Well done, Lynne!
0811729117|4.0|Carius' book is an outstanding look at the reality of armored warfare.  Far from the romantic view of modern knights, Carius explains what is actually involved in commanding a platoon of tanks.  The constant need to allocate resources to vehicle recovery, the reality of grand-tactical movement, just how much time a platoon commander is out of the track and on foot.  It's all in this book.  Carius does act as an apologist for the German army, but if one ignores the occasional rhetoric (as one should from both sides of the issue) there is a lot to be learned from this book.
B000001G5A|2.0|Perhaps I'm biased, but the first version of the Requiem that I heard was conducted by Neville Marriner and it's the only one that sounds right to me.<br />The Bohm version, while the recording quality is excellent and the orchestra/chorus is superb, is too slow for my liking. It is a piece written for a funeral and all but it sounds lurching to me; it still has to move along at some pace and I think the Marriner version does this well, better than Bohm's.

B000002NC4|5.0|Anti-pop melodies.  6+ minute epics.  Borderline violent transformations in mid-song that come out of nowhere.  Sounds dubious, right?<br />Well, if you want to be grabbed into a song on first listen by simple pop vocal lines and clearly defined guitar riffs, this won't be for you.  If you're looking for a little substance, this is definitely for you.  Upon subsequent listenings, you will hear and appreciate the double helix-like guitar riffs, interweaving into each other and away from each other, the balance between the ethereal tenor voice of Doug and the throbbing guitars, you will hear it what it is:  Music, Rock Music, done about as well as it can possibly be done.  Innovative, challenging, complex.  <br />Hurt a Fly is probably the most known song on the album, as it made rounds on college rock stations across the nation.  The use of strings to back up Doug's speed riff harmonies at the end of the song is one of the most exciting pieces I've heard in rock.  Stop the Show is probably my second favorite song, one that grows on you once the overlapping guitars sink in.  Untrustable, which ends the album, is hypnotic and rewarding, an example of the album as a whole.  This is one of those albums that you'll be listening to for years...if you are patient.
B00020HEG6|5.0|I love listening to soundtracks-they're my favorite form of music, especially when they are from excellent movies like Harry Potter. The best soundtracks, IMHO, invoke the corresponding bits and scenes of the movie. So it is, at times, a bit irritating when tracks are out of order with the events of the movie, such as in this soundtrack. (ie. the Whomping Willow music occurs much later than track 8) John William's third installment in the HP movie series is dynamic and masterful-displaying the Hogwarts and story we know and love, but with more thematic variations and different melodies than the scores of the first two movies. I was disappointed that Lupin's phonograph music wasn't on the soundtrack, but I guess I shouldn't have expected it to be. Here are descriptions of some of my favorite tracks:<br />Lumos! (Hedwig's Theme) is the theme we all know-a bit of nostalgia for the beginning of the soundtrack. The last track, Mischief Managed!, also starts with a recurring theme, and is a compilation of most of the other tracks, including Double Trouble, A Window to the Past, Buckbeak's Flight, and ends with Aunt Marge's Waltz.<br />Aunt Marge's Waltz is a little strange, but humorous. The Knight Bus is the craziest and most surprising track is you haven't listened to it before-it sounds like something straight out of a musical about a carnival. It is, though, very catchy and entertaining- one of my favorite tracks. Double Trouble, the most widely known theme, provides a solid base for theme of the other tracks, but it would've been nice if they included the lyrics with the pull out (but dedicated fans can find them rearranged in Act 4 of Macbeth).<br />I absolutely love Buckbeak's Flight (6) and A Window to the Past (7). They are easily the best \\"calm\\" tracks, being both melodic, soothing, and, most of the time, absent of loud bangs and accents. The Whomping Willow and the Snowball Fight is a combined track of two different themes-life-threatening action and then the comical \\"fight\\". It's definitely a very good track. Secrets of the Castle has an amusing woodwind solo near the end of the track. The Portrait Gallery and Hagrid the Professor are more upbeat than 6 and 7, very cute little tracks. The one that really steals the show is track 13, Quidditch, Third Year (interesting track number, no?). It's no longer the happy theme of the first movie's Quidditch match, but far more dark and menacing. It has great percussion and brass and lots of accented notes.<br />So overall, I definitely think this soundtrack is worth buying, especially if you liked the movie and like listening to soundtracks.
B0000TB01Y|3.0|&quot;Wicked&quot; is a great show, and the songs at first seem exciting and fun, but very soon become annoying and corny.  These are the kind of songs that are wonderful when seeing the show but don't translate wonderfully to a listening experience.  Luckily, the leading ladies are wonderfully talented and bestow a much-needed vocal talent to the sometimes trite tracks.  Meant only for the Wicked-obsessed.

0060090367|4.0|&quot;Watermelon&quot; is yet another enjoyable book by Marian Keyes. Her characters are always memorable, her writing style draws you in on the first page and the conclusion is very satisfying.<br />At the start of the book, the lovely Claire has been dumped by her husband for another woman a few hours after giving birth to their first child. She moves from their home in London back to her eccentric family in Dublin. Of course, all sorts of adventures, several romantic, ensue. <br />Keyes creates not only a strong, lively narrative voice--Claire is very funny, even her most desperate moments--but some great supporting characters. There is the hunky Adam, the snitty sister Helen, the flaky sister Anna, the slightly detached father and so on. Yes these characters hail from central casting but they are presented with a light and fresh touch.<br />I recommend this book to chick lit fans everywhere, particularly those who love their light lit with an English/Irish touch.
B00005JMYG|3.0|Yes, Anchorman is supposed to be a silly movie and it is. But, i went into the theater so much more. It really wasn't as funny as i hoped. I think Will Ferrel is a comedic genius, but i didn't think this film showcased his talent very well. Here a few Cliff's Notes versions on why it wasn't great. 1.The cameos weren't maxamized as they should've been 2.it just wasn't that funny 3. the actual movie omitted A LOT of stuff from the trailer 4. the sports guy isn't funny at all (equal comedy between all anchormen would've been better besides the film's namesake) 5. the conclusion of the movie isn't silly, it's stupid 6.and Afternoon Delight could've been taken so much further.<br />I am not trying to bash the film. There were some funny moments. I really enjoyed the weatherman and the field reporter characters. I like the idea that the stars ad-libbed.<br />I just wish the movie was funnier. Stupid comedy is supposed to be very stupid, but it is also supposed to be funny.

I like this album because you hear some really out there stuff like &quot;Bonzo's Montreux&quot; and some songs that sound like classic Zeppelin tunes like &quot;I can't quit you baby&quot; and &quot;We're Gonna Groove&quot;.  All in All this album is more than Just a fulfillment of a contract it is a look at side's of Zeppelin that you usually wouldn't see.

0156027321|4.0|Life of Pi is hugely entertaining on many levels.  Laugh-out-loud funny, acutely philisophical, tragic and spiritual.  These elements, although vastly dispirate, weave seemlessly to tie the story together in an almost perfect package. The juxtaposition of comedy versus tragedy, spirituality versus brutality, highlights the author's struggle with his faith and love of God in the face of immense loss.  Pi must reconcile both sides of himself, the pragmatist and the spiritualist, on his greatest journey of survival. Is his description of his survival at sea merely an allegory for a deeper struggle with himself?  Is belief in God a balm to sooth an aching soul or a truth beyond explanation or reason?

Therefore, coming from someone that did not &quot;know&quot; the Judge prior to the film I have to say that the movie was FANTASTIC!<BR>There are slight hints of Mad Max and Total Recall, so the movie falls into the action/adventure/science fiction type of category, and what a major hit this action-packed movie is!<BR>Sylvester Stallone, Armand Assante, Diane Lane, and Rob Schneider, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding, making this movie one of the best of its kind. The actors' great talent and chemistry clearly shows, thus providing a film that can be watched over and over again.  The plot, the setting, the special effects, the battles and the costumes are all wonderful!<BR>In short, I would definitely line up to watch a sequel!
B00003CXCT|1.0|As a Star Wars fan, this dvd set makes me sad. Most people here are complaining about the lack of non-special edition versions, and they have reason to complain. There's really no excuse for leaving them out when the Alien Quadrilogy had two versions of each movie AND commentary tracks. That aside, it's the special features disc that REALLY bothers me. Unless they announce more, there only seems to be a few featurettes, deleted scenes, trailers and a demo for a (...) Xbox game. What a waste of disc space that is. That measly collection of extra features could have been put together by a fan years ago. Lucas said he wanted to wait to make the OT dvd set special, well, this isn't it. I'm going to wait for the uber dvd set they'll make after the third prequel is completed. Come on, you know it'll happen.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|It took me a while to see it... but it was worth it.  An excellent movie with lots of action ... the ending wasn't what anyone expected, but that's OK (right?).<br />It's not the Lord of the Rings, Shrek/Shrek2 or Alien/Aliens, but they did an awesome job bringing everything together... and I don't care what anyone says -- the action was amazing (from 1 through 3).
B00008H2LB|5.0|to the one who said linkin park is a disgrace.... i know everyone has the right to like something or dont like something. have u listen to them? also, the lead singer is married, and they dont get paid BIG money. trust me.  ok, finish with that. I like linkin park. they are a band that i will listen to more. i very much enjoy the music they sing and play.
B00002ZMNV|5.0|This has got to be simply the most amazing piece of music i have ever heard. Symphony and metallica, who would have thought. I come from a country where people earn 2 to 4zl per hour and this double dvd cost me 150zl. It was worth every single penny. I love it and show it off to friends. Very highly recommended
0805062971|5.0|This is a rare thing. Whats rare? Well, this is the first instance In which I have encountered a work of literature that can be most enjoyed AFTER watching the movie. Maybe Ballards &quot;Crash&quot; falls into this category as well. It is definately a dual experience. Both book and movie are capable of standing alone, but a real Chuck fan will enjoy both. They have some different dynamics, but the core remains the same in both, and that core screams, &quot;Let me never be complete!&quot;
B000002UAO|5.0|While probably only a handfull of albums from 1965 are still in print,this one is about to go multiplatinum 7 times over. And why not,with Michelle,the grammy winning best song of the year,In my life,named the best song ever in a couple millenium polls,Nowhere man,a multi-million selling single,Norweigen wood,a groundbreaking song...
B0000028VT|2.0|If you look at each decade in music, there seems to be an artist that rises as the &quot;Artist of the Decade&quot;.  Although in some cases you can dispute it, you can make the argument that the following artists dominated their decade: Elvis Presley (1950s), The Beatles (1960s), The Bee Gees (1970s), and Michael Jackson (1980s).  The 1990s was a more difficult decade to decide as it was a down decade in the music industry.  If you take a look at commercial sales and #1 singles alone, Mariah Carey is one name that certainly comes to the top of the list for 90s artist of the decade.   She had #1 songs in nearly every year of the decade and sold lots of albums.   Her biggest selling album was her 1993 release entitled &quot;Music Box&quot;.   &quot;Music Box&quot; sold some 24 to 25 million copies and was a monster selling album.   However, this is a case where I just don't get it because I don't believe this is a very good album.   <br />There are several problems I have with &quot;Music Box&quot;.   First up, the sound is very familiar.   The album definitely has a Whitney Houston feel to it - and haven't we had enough Whitney Houston in the 80s.  I don't feel this album brings that much new to the table.     One thing I will give Mariah credit for is that she plays a much more prevelant role in songwriting than Whitney Houston.  Most of her #1 songs have been written by Carey herself.   This brings me to the second point - the lyrics - in many cases (with on exception) I don't think the lyrics are all that strong and don't go very deep.    Finally, the album just isn't very interesting.  There are three good songs, but there isn't much more that is going to capture your interest.<br />There are three songs that really save this album.   &quot;Dreamlover&quot; was a #1 song and is a catchy song with some catchy, but not necessarily deep lyrics.  It has somehwat of an 80s feel to it since there is a heavy dose of keyboards and synthesizers in it.   Carey herself wrote the lyrics and co-wrote the music and does a nice job.   The background vocals are mixed in nicely - I believe they are done by Carey herself.   Although &quot;Dreamlover&quot; doesn't go deep with the lyrics, the song &quot;Hero&quot; (another #1 song)  does.   Personally this is as good a song that Mariah Carey has done.   Although it doesn't sound anything like a Dan Fogelberg song, Mariah Carey does something that Dan Fogelberg was a master of in his music - making use of music and lyrics to paint a picture.  In this case Carey paints a picture of a Hero.  Another analogy in this song is the &quot;Air Supply&quot; approach.  The group Air Supply were masters at building a song up to a crescendo and in &quot;Hero&quot; builds up to a magnificent crescendo.   Mariah also shows her trademark vocal range in this song.   The third song that is worth listening to on the album is the song &quot;Anytime You Need a Friend&quot;.   This song doesn't get the attention that the #1 hits got on the song, but what really sets this song apart are the gospel-style background vocals in this song.  It makes for something different and some enjoyable listening.<br />After those first three tracks things get boring and uninteresting.  The title track &quot;Music Box&quot; doesn't really excite me that much.   &quot;Now That I Know&quot;, &quot;Just to Hold You Again&quot; , and &quot;All I've Ever Wanted&quot;  are ok songs with nice Carey vocals, but sound almost like clones of Whitney Houston songs.    &quot;Never Forget You&quot; has its moments, but isn't a song that I'm really going to want to hear.  Babyface, who is the co-writer and background vocalist on &quot;Never Forget You&quot; really doesn't kindle any magic like he did when he collaborated with Eric Clapton.   The remake of Nillson's &quot;Without You&quot; is helped by Mariah's vocals, but this really isn't one of the better remakes of this song.   I don't think &quot;I've Been Thinking About You&quot; does much to stand out in my mind.  This song is one of the weaker songwriting efforts by Carey as it seems like she forced the lyrics to work in many parts of this song.<br />All of the lyrics and credits for the musicians are included in the liner notes.  Mariah includes a whole &quot;panel&quot; in the liner notes that has a bunch of &quot;Thank Yous&quot; to the various people whom she collaborated with.   Her at the time husband, Sony Boss Tommy Mottola gets a huge thank you - and oh my,have things changed since this album was recorded back in 1992/3.<br />The Mariah Carey fan will probably like this album.  The casual fan will definitely like the hit songs off this album, but I feel this album doesn't bring that much to the table.   I do feel this is an example of an album that received a boost from some singles that got a lot of airplay and sales, but as a whole this album just isn't very good.  I don't recommend it.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|The fight scenes were great; the graphics were amazing... the dancing was a bit fluffy (is that all they do down there... well, but, hey, what else is there to do?)... worthy of being the Matrix 2 (but, of course, not even close to beating #1).
B000002O7C|4.0|For people who know Basil Poledouris, most consider this his best score to date.  Each track has it's own unique charcteristics and creative motifs which makes it such an enjoyable listen; even the last two tracks which are mostly synth, but still very effective.  He perfectly captures the mood of each scene and the spirit of intrigue and adventure.  He also weaves the Russian style into the score very well.<BR>I used to collect soundtracks and this was one of my favorites.  I miss it every time I hear the main them or see the movie.  <BR>The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five is because it is one of the shortest soundtracks you will ever hear.  I believe it is only about 30 minutes long.  However, I believe it is well worth the $10 or less you'll pay for it.
B0000TLA9G|3.0|the first 2/3rds of the CD are all worthy of GnR's greatest hits, but the ending is a huge disappointment, culminating in the absolute worst GnR's remake of &quot;Sympathy for the Devil.&quot; Estranged, Used to Love Her and other tracks are much more deserving than the final 3 on this album. Estranged, in particular, would demonstrate more fully how Slash's excellent guitar-playing carried a lot of GnR songs, taking the burden off Axel's singing and lyrics. <br />My guess is the record company made an incomplete and flawed product on purpose because they reckoned that those introduced to GnR from this album would then feel compelled to buy the other CD's with the missing tracks they'd heard were also essential.
0385493622|5.0|Awe-inspiring book from Dr. Simon Singh. This book narrates the mathematician Andrew Wiles' effort to solve Fermat's Last Theorem. The theorem proposed by mathematician Pierre de Fermat has remained without any mathematical proof for centuries in spite of various attempts until Andrew Wiles provided the proof for the theorem.<BR>The author traces the history of mathematics from Pythagoras, Euler, Fermat to the modern day Andrew Wiles. The author has narrated the story in simple and beautiful English. Recommended for anyone who wants to get inspiration and motivation from the efforts of mathematicians and apply it. Wonderful book!!
0345440900|5.0|This book is amazing.  After three or four days of getting our six week old son on this schedule his sleep at night has increased from 2-4 hours a night to 5-7 hours night almost instantly.  I just wish I would of read this before the baby was born as we were falling into some of the bad habits she talks about (over stimulation, over feeding) that leads to fussy children and bad sleep patterns.  MUCH happier parents and baby.
B00005BL2A|1.0|The cd is a great disappointment.  ALL the songs are quite slow.  And as a warning, when the song &quot;Dream On&quot; was on the radio, this song won't be the same version that is on the CD.  The CD version of this song is horrible and does not have the same fast-paced beat.  Because of this album i will never buy another Depeche Mode cd again.  Stick with Violator and remember the &quot;memories&quot; of when Depeche Mode was actually a good band.
B00009MGQL|5.0|Long before the Crystal Brothers/Chemical Method creators were in diapers reaching up and knocking over needles as Joy Division crackled out of boxy wall-mounted speakers, Mr. Beck was cranking out the foundation of Techno.<br />This is the definitive Techno album.  Fusing blues and rock, metal and industrial, Jeff simply kicks.  If you haven't listened to this with headphones, do it.  No one does like Mr. Beck.  Any fan of instrumental guitar improvisations and any fan of what Techno music does well, should buy this album.<br />Crank it.
B0000TLA9G|3.0|Like Stone Temple Pilots, the band's greatest hits album was my introduction to GNR.  I listened to it all the way and didn't think much of it.  We just went on vacation and I decided to bring it with me.  I'm glad I did.  &quot;Don't Cry&quot;, &quot;Paradise City&quot;, &quot;Patience&quot;, &quot;November Rain&quot;, and &quot;Sweet Child o' Mine&quot; are fantastic.  &quot;You Could Be Mine&quot;, &quot;Knockin' On Heaven's Door&quot;, and &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot; are also very good.  The last few tracks aren't very good in my opinion.  Like a lot of people, I wondered why over a third of the album were cover songs.  I know GNR didn't release a lot of albums, but they certainly could have pulled a few more songs out.  I would have liked to have seen &quot;It's So Easy&quot;, &quot;Nightrain&quot;, &quot;Rocket Queen&quot;, and &quot;Estranged&quot;, &quot;Dust N' Bones&quot;, and &quot;14 Years&quot; on there.  I think it's a great intro to GNR, and for that, it's worth getting.  It's gotten me into them, that's for sure.  After buying this Greatest Hits album, I've gone out and purchased all of their albums.  Use Your Illusion II is my favorite.
1400032717|4.0|Christopher's life as an autistic is insightful, but frustrating, as we see the strain on his parents' lives and their frequent breakdowns through his emotionally vacant and almost uninterested narrative. The story is less about the dead dog than the awkward and excruciatingly detailed journeys it leads him to, and while the story is exquisite and precise in its telling, it feels like it would have been better served as a novella. The science and math facts that Christopher interjects into his account of the Curious Incident are interesting but become more obvious in their true intent as a padding device as the story drags on.<br />That being said, Haddon is a wonderful writer, with a tight and measured style that feels like the mathematical average of all modern writing styles, and the detached narrative keeps the story from being too cliched as it drags on. 'The Curious Incident...' is a delightful and brief read, loving and frustrating.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|About a year ago while researching new musicians under the wing of Clive Davis on the internet I had the chance to see the postage sized MPG video introduction of Gavin DeGraw. It was obvious this kid had something even on these diamond in the rough audition sequences. I waited for a long time before hearing more about him. The wait was worth it!<BR>What has happened since with this talent is simply exceptional. Mr. Davis and J-Records have once again found a unique artist and have helped him burn a place for himself in the recording industry like a yag laser!<BR>For a first effort &quot;Chariot&quot; comes off as a practiced piece delivered by nothing less than a veteran songster.<BR>I can only hope Degraw has a long, long run with many more contributions to today's music scene...<BR>I know he will on my CD player!
0767830555|5.0|After watching the classic 1976 film \\"Taxi Driver,\\" viewers may be interested in their reaction. It can be depressing. Martin Scorsese directed this open-sore of a film and of his many classic works, this is the one most obsessively analyzed. \\"Taxi Driver\\" is such a raw, visceral experience that after viewing its nightmarish terrain one must decompress. <br />Seedy does not begin to describe the horror of \\"Taxi Driver,\\" which details a world of pimps, prostitutes, drug addicts and a loner psycho brilliantly portrayed by Robert De Niro. This film established some of the great talents in motion picture history including De Niro, Scorsese, Albert Brooks and Jodie Foster. I wonder about disturbing epics like \\"Taxi Driver,\\" \\"A Clockwork Orange,\\" \\"Straw Dogs\\" and \\"Natural Born Killers.\\" Whenever I visit the video store, I notice these films are usually checked out, empty boxes leaning against the shelf. Who's watching these films, and why so often? The films share a common thread in that they have likable actors (De Niro, Malcolm McDowell, Dustin Hoffman, Woody Harrelson) playing despicable men prone to violent rages. Alienated one and all, these characters have become anti-heroes for a world severely lacking in heroes. There are so many ways to view this film, with multiple levels serving as proof to its complicated brilliance. Urban alienation, cultural emptiness, veiled racism, Watergate analogy and Oswald repression are just a few of the metaphorical doors one can open in this nightmare. <br />De Niro's Bickle is a Vietnam veteran suffering from insomnia. He takes a job as a cab driver to work nights, driving through the most dangerous New York neighborhoods for fares. He becomes infatuated with a beautiful woman (Cybill Shepherd) who works at the campaign office of Palantine. Bickle takes the woman to a porno theater on their first date, and she dumps him immediately. To no one's surprise, Bickle soon begins to stalk her. He purchases a deadly arsenal of hand guns and intensely works out in preparation for his assassination of Palantine (and most likely the woman too). Along the way, Bickle stumbles across a 12-year old prostitute (Foster) whom he befriends. His attempted assassination fails and he walks over to the prostitute's home and kills her pimp (Harvey Keitel), landlord and an unlucky gangster. \\"Taxi Driver\\" unbelievably ends with the prostitute having been returned to her parents and Bickle becoming an inner-city folk hero. Shepherd's character tries to make a date with Bickle, but he's now at peace with the inferno around him and drives on disinterested.<br />This ending has been debated for years. It is so controversial that when the film first ran on television, stations posted warnings stating they did not consider Bickle a hero. They're right. Bickle's a whacked-out cultural icon, granted, but he's no hero. He wants to be a hero, and perhaps the final scene is Bickle at the moment of death dreaming of a happy ending. He's essentially saved the day and rescued a damsel in distress. Bickle was seriously wounded after the shootout, having been shot in the neck. So it could have been a dream sequence, though Scorsese purposefully made it too vague to be entirely sure.<br />It's clear Bickle wishes to be a cowboy hero in \\"Taxi Driver,\\" as seen by the boots he wears and the guns he straps on like an inner-city John Wayne. His famously improvised \\"You talkin' to me?\\" speech is in fact a line of dialog lifted from the classic 1953 western \\"Shane.\\" And the final showdown has Bickle taking on three men (outnumbered a la Cooper in \\"High Noon\\") in a bloody, ferocious battle that to this day is one of the most violent scenes in history. Bickle, adorned in Mohawk and Army jacket, fires at random. The violence is so sloppy one gets the feeling they are viewing an actual crime scene. There is no music, only the jagged noises of constant screaming and guns blasting within closed-in spaces. While we love the balletic violence of the final shootout in \\"The Wild Bunch,\\" we turn away from the gore in \\"Taxi Driver.\\" It's as repellant as reality.<br />Scorsese's masterpiece is not intended for the young or emotionally disturbed. Bickle is not a hero in a film populated by an army of non-heroes. Still, viewers just might get confused. I know Bickle is crazy, but I feel sorry for him. At times, I even identify with him. And that can be depressing.
B000002UAX|2.0|As a reviewer below noted, &quot;...within these two discs reside one solid disc of tunes.&quot;  You said it.  It's unfortunate that the price reflects that of two CDs.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This is the best single CD Beatles collection available. It provides an excellent, high-level overview of their career and music. It contains 26 songs that hit number 1 either in the US or UK. The one exception being George Harrison's \\"Something\\", which peaked at number 3, though the liner notes give it credit for hitting number 1 because it was the B-side of a number 1 single (\\"Come Together\\"). But I can forgive that fudging, since I'm sure it was done to ensure that a Harrison song was included on the collection. All-in-all, a classic collection and a great introduction to the Beatles for new fans. I just wish they would release a Beatles 2 CD similar to the Elvis 2nd to None CD. They certainly have plenty of material to pick from!<br /><br />Btw, an interesting bit of trivia: The British Beatles hold the record for the most number 1 singles in the US, followed by the American Elvis. While Elvis holds the record for most number 1 singles in Britian followed by the Beatles.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I read a few reviews about Avril's CD that really were disrespectful.  I know that I might sound disrespectful by saying this, but Avril Lavigne has a good reason to dislike Britney Spears without getting to know her.  Britney Spears is morally wrong and cannot sing.  I don't care what anyone says- she does not have a good voice!  She does not write but maybe a few words to each poorly produced CD she makes!  She does not play an instrument, or could even try.  I mean, Avril at least plays a little guitar in this album, which I hope to hear more of in the future.    It seems like every single celebrity is getting an album these days, whether it's Hilary Duff or Ashlee Simpson.  And the singers are going onto reality shows, something else I look down upon (with an exceptional few that don't involve relationships and junk like that).  While some actresses and actors prove to have tolerable voices, the others just really don't do much and are making albums just for the extra money that they could probably do without.  Avril Lavigne proves she can make an album without being famous first and without singing anything bubblegum.    Here are 12 excellent reasons why you should pick up a copy of \\"Under My Skin\\":    1. Take Me Away- This is my second favorite song on the album.  It's very angsty and a great way to start off the album.  The only thing I hate about this song is it's length- it's the shortest song on the album.  But still a fabulous song nonetheless 5/5    2. Together- This is an example of PERFECTION!  This song blows me away everytime I listen to it.  I especially like the prechorus: \\"When I'm alone I feel so much better, When I'm around you I don't feel together.\\"  This is my favorite song on the album. 5/5    3. Don't Tell Me- I think this is a great single and I love the beginning verse.  It's very explanatory and does well as single, but it's still not the best song on the album. 4.5/5    4. He Wasn't- This is a definite sequel to \\"Sk8er Boi\\" in my opinion.  It's cute- I really like the riff.  The words just don't do much- they kind of remind me of something Hilary Duff might sing (Sorry Avril) but it's still good. 4.5/5    5. How Does It Feel- This is a very pretty song, talking about how Avril is different from the world.  It shows her softer, less rebellious side.  It's not my favorite, I really don't like the \\"ah ah ah ah ah\\" part, but still very beautiful in it's own way. 4.5/5    6. My Happy Ending- At first I wasn't too crazy about this being a single, but now I'm getting a little happier.  I like the chorus alot.  They overplay it on the radio, so I skip it on the album, but it's still a five star song. 5/5    7. Nobody's Home- I love this song!  The lyrics sound very professional and the tune is good, it was cowritten by none other than Ben Moody, another true musician. 5/5    8. Forgotten- This is probably the hardest song on the CD.  It's definitely one of my favorites, but the words could use some working on.  Oh well, it's a fabulous song. 5/5    9. Who Knows- This isn't my favorite song, but I like it.  I really like the riff, but I think this is the ultimate filler track. 4.5/5    10. Fall To Peices- This is the love song of the CD- it's pretty good.  It's much more acoustic.  This is a good song and I don't skip it.  It reminds me alot of \\"Things I'll Never Say\\" from \\"Let Go\\". 4.5/5    11. Freak Out- This is one of my favorite songs with reason- I absolutely LOVE the first part.  It sounds a bit faded, but the guitar just sounds so awesome!! 5/5    12. Slipped Away- This is the perfect ending to a perfect album.  Period. 5/5    Well, there you have it.  A great album.  Better than her first by far, Avril calms down a little bit and we get inside her head a little more.  Well done.
0385335482|4.0|Becky's situation gave me panic attacks. I dread bills and the idea of being in debt, so her spending habits made me really anxious. becky's thinking processes (especially her rationalization for spending) are quite interesting and at times, extremely hilarious. I'm glad she has a good support system and at the end of the day, she still has a good head on her shoulders. I think her character really grew on me and I ended up reading the 2nd 1/2 of the book quite quickly, and enjoying it too. It's a funny, brainless read (good for the beach). However, I don't plan on spending another 10 quids on the sequels; I'll just get it out from the library.
B000040OBS|5.0|It really bothers me to see all these reviews that try to pigeonhole this album into some kind of concept of \\"punk rock\\" or \\"electronica\\" to make it more palatable to Joe Consumer.  Both of these genre titles dumb down what this album really is.  It is not untalented three-chord rebellious silliness, and it is not take-designer-drugs-and-dry-hump all night nonsense.  It is a couple of very creative folk who were stuck in 1971 and decided to make something very different.  There is no \\"drum machine\\" -- there is rhythm culled from the rhythm \\"machine\\" part of some old, decrepit organ; it has more in common with the madness of Sly and the Family Stone's \\"Fresh\\" than some boring New Romantic album.  Alan Vega was known for wearing a leather jacket and hitting walls with chains in 1971 and scaring audiences that expected yet more hippie feel-good rock -- years before the Sex Pistols' poseur rehashed 1950's hits -- and Martin Rev -- I won't be arrogant enough to claim to know the model of organ he played -- he didn't by any means play \\"state of the art\\" equipment nor a Farfisa, but rather the kind of organ you'd probably find for $20 in a thrift store these days.  There are no synthesizers on this record.  Synthesizers by definition are instruments which attempt to re-create the sound of other instruments by synthesis;  what you hear on this record is not some wanker trying to re-create a lush orchestral arrangement.  The lyrics are often parodies of contemporary rock -- to be blind to that is to confine this record to the cut-out bins of history.  So please, no more bland \\"if you love the Sex Pistols, this is great!\\" or \\"this is a lot like Joy Division\\" reviews written by people who bought this because they read a SPIN magazine article citing this as \\"influential\\" -- you're all full of something that stinks and comes out of male cattle. Rot.
B000075BFK|5.0|Molly from Texas, you're a b*tch who wouldnt know HipHop if you owned every f*ckin rap cd there is.  How dare you insult a legend like 2Pac.  F*ck Nelly, 50 Cent, and all those other pop acts.  2Pac is the Greatest Of All Time and nobody(especially you b*tch) is gonna change that.<br />I was friends with 2Pac back in '96 when his life was sadly cut short.  When I talked to 2Pac, I discovered that he was probably the greatest influence in music and that has not changed.  I feel sorry for people like Molly from Texas and all those other haters, that they have yet to discover the greatness in Pac's lyrics.<br />P.S.- This albums a classic Hip-Hop record.<br />Was this review helpful to you?
B00009UW0N|5.0|Halloween was the very first horror movie I saw as a kid, at age 4.Ever since then, no Halloween or anytime of the year is complete for me without Dr.Loomis, Laurie Strode, Sheriff Brackett, and of course the man himself, Michael Myers. This movie epitomizes everything that Halloween is..the bogeyman laying in the dark shadow of the room , waiting for the perfect moment to strike..It's got everything..From the typical American small town, horror movies in the city just don't work..The great horror flicks of all time:Halloween, Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Amityville Horror, Last House on the Left, The Town That Dreaded Sundown, and Scream, they all took place in small towns or in the middles of nowhere..<br />Plus Halloween films for me have always somehow managed to get the intangible down:Atmosphere.They nail the Halloween , late fall atmsophere perfectly..I loved the whole bunch of them..I'm a sucker for horror though. I also love all the Friday the 13ths, Texas Chainsaws, Screams, and Nightmares.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|Great movie.  It was very similar to Donnie Darko.  The director's cut ending is very depressing though.  I would recommend only watching the theatre version if you are pregnant.  As my husband puts it &quot;that is the most depressing thing I ever saw&quot;
B00024BHTC|5.0|I really enjoy Nightwish's long-awaited album &quot;Once.&quot; This is very good music. Tarja's voice is chilling, and for the last few reviewers who hated this album, opinions don't make you right. &quot;I have a degree in music&quot; doesn't either, to quote one reviewer. This is a diverse, symphonic, poetic masterpiece that shows how much diversity and melody a Heavy Metal band can have. Some of the songs are slower than others, such as &quot;Nemo&quot; and &quot;Creek Mary's Blood.&quot; But, many are just as fast and heavy as those on the albums &quot;Oceanborn&quot; and &quot;Wishmaster.&quot; The songs &quot;Dark Chest of Wonders&quot; and &quot;Planet Hell&quot; are heavy, dark and very fast. If you like Heavy Metal that is fast-paced and very melodic, you must listen to this. You might really like it. This Finnish band is a joy to listen to, and until the CD is released domestically, I have to say it is still worth the import price.
0385335482|1.0|I can't believe this book got good reviews. I read it when I was fourteen and was completely disgusted. Is her compulsive spending supposed to be cute? The main character is a flat moron who does meaningless moronic things and winds up with a hot boyfriend.<br />Oh Jesus, it makes my stomach hurt, the way this book sells.
B00005U8EM|5.0|There are so many messages behind this great movie with Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell.  He is head over heals for MacDowell from the start, but as an arrogant weatherman, he seems to just tick her off from the start as well.<br />Imagine waking up every morning and it is the same day over and over again?  Well, Murray has this happen to him.  Every time he does his day becomes one disaster after another until he finally gives in and figures out he can use each day to improve himself and his life a little at a time.<br />The message here is clear.  We all have a life that is made up of the same day everyday, what we choose to do with that day is really up to us.  Do we want to improve our lot in life or just go along with being ourselves in a boring unfulfilled endless life that is a cycle of recurring themes?<br />This movie shows anyone, even though it is a comedy, that each day we have a choice to make the day what it can be.  Murray plays Phil Connors, on Ground Hog Day when the ground hog's name is also Phil...go figure. Connors is as arrogant as they come and he just keeps trying so hard to impress people.<br />He goes from egotisical and self serving to seeing himself to get the girl of his dreams, Rita.  It would be nice to know how many days of Ground Hog Days he spent there.  You can see him go from this to a renaissance man who really cares about people, loves life and takes each day and uses it to improve himself.<br />Rita, although the same person and not being influenced or affected by being in Ground Hog day, comes to really like Phil.  This movie makes us laugh at ourselves and our humanity.  And by the end of the movie, he shows that he can have a positive effect on everyone he comes in contact with.<br />So when you hear the song, &quot;I've Got You Babe,&quot; and the announcers saying, &quot;It's Ground Hog Day.....&quot; remember to use the day to its fullest.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|In the Zone is amazing, don't listen to 95% of the bad reviews because most of them come from people that have never heard the album and simply just don't like the girl.  Regardless of what you think of Britney, she does a great job on this CD, and fuses many different music styles and sounds.  In all honesty I have always liked Britney but not enough to purchase any of her CDs until now.  The best songs on the CD are: the #1 smash hit Toxic, Everytime, Showdown, and Boom Boom.  I have listened to this CD over and over and have yet to get tired of it.  She may not have Christina's powerful voice, but she does have a knack for creating great songs and hot dance beats, which is evident in the fact that she wrote more than half the songs on the album.   If you are a pop music fan this is a must have item.  To all the \\"haters\\" face it the girl is here to stay!  Long live Britney Spears the world's Princess of Pop and soon to be Queen!
B00005QGAV|5.0|Michael Jackson somehow manages to be both one of the most overrated and underrated artists. Thriller was very overrated, relative to the quality of his other albums (HIStory, anybody?), and by the same token, albums like Dangerous are entirely ignored. This to me is a great injustice, but I won't get into that. <br />Dangerous is an amazing work with its own unique sound. Although there are a few songs that would only be defined as &quot;filler&quot;, most of the tracks are masterpieces.<br />1) Jam- This is one of the great songs on the album, a rhythmic and uptempo tune, a great beginning to a great album. 9/10 stars.<br />2) Why You Wanna Trip On Me- One of my personal favorites, at least the first sixty times. It has an excellent intro and harsh whispered lyrics... and then there's the chorus, an almost-yelled melody that makes you go &quot;He has a point.&quot; 7/10 stars.<br />3) In the Closet- This one is incredible, although a little disturbing to some, maybe. It's a little more sensual than his usual style, but he definetely pulls it off. 7.5/10 stars.<br />4) She Drives Me Wild- To me, a twin of In the Closet. Same type of theme, same type of sound- not nearly as good as its brother, but not horrible either. 6/10 stars.<br />5) Remember the Time- A fantasic sounding melody with a hint of Egyptian flare. This is a definite hit for this album, it will have even the staunchest nonbelievers on the floor dancing. 8/10 stars.<br />6) Can't Let Her Get Away- Sadly, although it has a catchy bridge, this one always seems to be forgotten amidst all the hits. 6/10 stars.<br />7) Heal the World- A sharp change of background, with a more ballady feel. This song is beautiful, with a message that needs to be heard today. 8/10 stars.<br />8) Black or White- One of the songs that will never die. With an amazing melody and a deep meaning, this song is what Michael Jackson is all about. 10/10 stars.<br />9) Who Is It- Another of my personal favorites, but maybe it's becausethe video is so amazing. This song has an excellent underlying bass tune that makes the song come alive. A fantastic work. 9/10 stars.<br />10)  Give In To Me- Has a more rockish feel to it- I love the intro and the guitar melody, this is basically an awesome song. 9/10 stars.<br />11) Will You Be There- An entirely beautiful masterpiece. What makes it as great as it is, of course, is the spoken verse at the end. 10/10 stars.<br />12) Keep the Faith- Possibly my favorite MJ song, I love the verses and the chorus and the bridge and of course the closing, with the choir in the background. This is a fantastic song. 10/10 stars.<br />13) Gone Too Soon- A beautifully sad goodbye to a young teenager, Ryan White, who died of AIDS around this time. The song isn't quite as catchy as others, had has a gorgeous melody. 7/10 stars.<br />14) Dangerous- One of the greatest songs on here, it has awesome spoken verses and a chorus that will have you singing all day. A spectacular close to a spectacular album. 9/10 stars.<br />And that's Dangerous. It is truly one of Michael Jackson's greatest works, the one that makes you see that Michael will live forever.
006072448X|5.0|If you've ever wondered about the life of a criminal, this story gives a description of a possible path filled with unhappiness. Eva, the mother of Kevin, waits a long time to have a baby. In fact, she is so happy with her husband, that she is not even sure she wants to be a parent, but in the end she leans more towards parenthood. She lives to regret this decision. Her son, Kevin, is born unhappy. Eva becomes an apathetic mother in many situations even though she knows he does not behave normally, while her husband turns a blind eye to Kevin's problems. Both parents, in their own ways, love their son. In the end, though, they are not proactive enough to help him or those he hurts.<br />Some people will think that no one could ignore everything that Kevin's parents ignore, however, based on real-life crimes committed by young people in our country, it's probably more realistic than we would like to believe. I think a life can be based on apathy in some families. We can look at the school shootings that have already taken place and imagine that this may have been the type of life that one or more of them led.<br />This was a disturbing, fictional look at how a life may have progressed towards a violent outcome. A very interesting read.
B00003CX8N|5.0|I adore this film.  I discovered Helen Hanff's books only after I had seen this film.  Both are treasures.  Hanff's story tells of her long distance association with a London book shop that specializes in finding rare volumes at a reasonable price.  Her correspondence with the shop's manager is the basis of the story.  This is a love story - of sorts.  These people all love books - not mass market knock-offs, but books rich in history and poetry.  The trans-Atlantic relationship is brought off beautifully.  Bancroft and Hopkins shine in their roles.  The supporting characters (including Mercedes Ruehl and Judi Dench) are wonderfully understated.  The screenplay by Hugh Whitemore captures the very essence of Hanff's memoir.  If you adore books and fine films, do not miss this.
B000005JA8|5.0|That is how I would describe all of you mudslinging soldiers of the amazon.com battlefield. I just read through a monstrous heap of 1 star and 5 star reviews and hardly anybody wrote about what they themselves liked or hated about the music and for what reason. Music is about the personal experience, nobody is right or wrong (probably).<br />Now I'll write about myself. A couple of adjectives come to mind when I think of this cd, particularly absurd, excessive, extreme, childish, messy, and spontaneous. While I'm sure this sounds like a recipe for musical disaster to many people, this album puts me in a wonderful mood. It has that hilarious and wonderful feeling of childs play (eric dolphy's &quot;out to lunch&quot; comes to mind) that very few musicians are able to capture. Its that feeling that makes you forgive the music for its flaws, and love it for its highlights, which i feel outweigh the failures by a ton. At times this album sounds so cacaphonic that its funny, and while this could have made for a terrible album, its the conviction in the playing and singing that keeps it balanced (teetering precariously though); the harmonies, melodies, rhythms... music in general on this cd is pretty damn interesting and pleasing in a bizarre way. Overall, the album has that flowing feeling of &quot;rock and roll&quot; that draws you in and keeps that rocking feeling even when the band sounds as if its falling to pieces.<br />On the down side the album is a bit long and i think a couple of songs could have been cut without too much loss. The production is pretty harsh and probably could have been better, but on the other hand i feel that it works well with the music. I guess some people might find the lyrics a bit pretentious (if you consider intentional half-sense to be pretentious), but I find them funny in their glorious absurdity<br />The unlistenability of this album is completely overrated (aside from maybe the song Pena, which i happen to like a lot). I wont deny that it might be a difficult album to those unfamiliar with avant garde music, jazz, rock, blues... yeah just go into this album with as open a mind as possible, see what happens. beefheart never does what you think he'd do, and thats not a bad thing at all. this is music that cracks me up and has substance at the same time, balances things out. music doesnt have to be serious all the time. Fast and bulbous!hat it might be a difficult album to those unfamiliar with avant garde music, jazz, rock, blues... yeah just go into this album with as open a mind as possible, see what happens. beefheart never does what you think he'd do, and thats not a bad thing at all. this is music that cracks me up and has substance at the same time, balances things out. music doesnt have to be serious all the time.

B0000648WZ|1.0|Starship troopers, probably set in the year 4000AD or something is a complete fasico, honestly. What kind of sick moron would create a movie about a bunch of sexy, small titted geeks joining the federal service thing to fight a bunch of mutated insects on the other side of the galaxy. attack, then lots of blood and death (and yet Rico some how manages to be listed corps, but he lives in a bath of green goo) and then they go back for more. Whoopee doo da. Rubbish, and i dont core if you disagree. The most unrealistic film since, well, since ever! From psycic people to roughneck. Thats not the human world. no way! The human world would probable nuke the hell out of \\"klendathu\\" the archnids home planet leaving a larghe collection of ash and rubble. And the real world probably  wouldn't waste billions of pounds of huge space ships that are going to blow up from cosmic sperm. Nah, we would send thermonuclear probs or something, dodge in and out of the sperm and fly into a random guess at the best spot. Or, instead of using nuclear weapons we could take the right piss. Build a hug maginifying glass over the planets and use there own stars against them and magnify the heat 10,000 times and fry the bastards.<br />Denise richards must have been pissed to have said yes to acting in this film. What was she thinking?! Why is her hair so long?! and why does she have to smile all the time?! Does here mouth ever close? She did my head in in this \\"film\\" her acing may be up to scratch compared to the other actors but she could have done better (compare \\"the world is not enough\\"). Johny Rico quite cleary is dressed up to look like one of those life sized action men, the right hair anyway. His freak friend, I forget his name but I know he has been in many other films before. He didn't show up often which was a releif because he is quite ugly. but i suppose being able to mentally control and read the emotions of other animals counts against it. <br />On the plus side of this film (Yesthere is one!!) the graphics and that of the big sacestations is quite good, not as good as say the matrix but it is good. just good. I admit to enjoying them little news reports from the \\"federal network\\" but thats about it. Starship Troopers is the perfect example of an over budgetted film and too many speciall effects which drive the film prducers of making a film of good acting. I think the proper scientific definition of this is the matrix revalutions and reloaded.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was aghast to learn that the show that I absorbed on DVD over the course of two days had been cancelled by Fox.  This show is simply amazing...good writing, good humor, colorful imperfect characters that you feel like you know after only a few episodes.  This show has something that I have not seen in many other shows in the past (none that I currently watch).  Help bring this show back by purchasing a DVD.
B000001Y16|5.0|This album is very mysterious, the lyrics are sick there is a message in it like there is one in the resurrection soundtrack. my friend prophecies tupacs ways and has a shrine of albums all copied in his bedroom.i dont agree with his views on tupac being alive and hidding somewhere.he loves tupac as you would love your parents. the best track on this album by far is KRAZY. however as this is a great album which has put tupac on the rap scene and mc scene this is truly a great piece of work by the master<BR>thankz
0131103628|5.0|Great book, not for people who nothing about programming.  If you &quot;look inside this book&quot; (or find this book at a local bookstore) and can read the intro pages, you could see that they come right out and say that their target audience should know about variables, and other basics of programming (functions and decision making if-else, i think).  I bought this book used, and apparantly the person who owned it before me did not check out the content nor what was assumed of the readers.  Although it may sound kind of mean, I found it hilarious as I was flipping through the pages where he had written in things like &quot;What's a double?&quot;, &quot;whats this:    ?&quot;, &quot;LOWER = 0; ?&quot;.    If you're unsure whether this book is for you, click on that &quot;look inside this book&quot; above and try following along in the first chapter.  If you get lost, get an easier book.  If it's just right, then go for it.
B0000CC5CS|4.0|I said  it before and I will say it again - The terminator seris is the best collection of films since Charle Chaplines easy street. It prooves how far the prducers have came since the best of the three the terminator (the 1st). Althought the acting has noticably deterieated a slight. At least it is not as bad as some films, like the matrix 2 and 3. <br />I think that the general plot of this film was outstanding, although i wish the ending was happier and more tension throughout was needed. The female terminator is a good idea but clearly playing the role of a super terminator isn't exactlye demanding the rules are as follows -> look sexy, dont show emotion and shoot stuff. thats it.
B000002OX7|5.0|From the cover art of the band just finishing urinating on that concrete pillar to the last note of the last song, WHO'S NEXT is an all-time Rock And Roll classic must-have CD!!!!<BR>I first discovered 'Behind Blue Eyes' from this album when I found, circa 1974 a 45 rpm copy on the original Decca label laying on the ground, discarded by someone. It was in amazing condition! I loved the song immediately and later bought the LP.<BR>Many of the tunes on the CD are Classic Rock Radio standards, such as 'Baba O' Riley' with one of the first uses of a MOOG synthesizer as its' opening, and the great line 'Teenage Wasteland' (which was spray painted on a wall at my High School, by the way!)  This is an album in which you can truly say that 'It's All Good!' It's an all-time great album!<BR> This album was played at many of the Junior High/High School parties I attended, along with Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, etc. <BR>I think that certain tunes on this album are nearly 'burned out'in a lot of people's minds by continuous radio play, but when you listen to the CD as a whole album, it still stands the test of time, in my humble opinion.<BR>It's also nice to hear an alternate take on 'Behind Blue Eyes' on this remastered version of the CD. It's a cool version!<BR>A 'MUST HAVE' FOR CLASSIC ROCK FANS!!!!
B00011D1OA|4.0|MFL is a marvellous film about a professor who turns a common flower girl into a lady.  It is full of sing-a-long songs and funny moments.  It is basically a classic for all the right reasons!  Plenty of re-watch factor makes it a film to own.    In 1994, the film was restored and thank the lord they did!  The film's negative was almost lost forever.  In fact, the film had become yellow-tinged and full of scratches, blotches and all the rest!  It would have been a very sad day for the movie industry if a flim like this had been lost.    The original DVD that featured this new restoration was released in the late 90's. This DVD included a 9 minute featurette, actor profiles, audio commentary, and Audrey Hepburn singing in 2 scenes.    This original 1-disc DVD has since been updated to a special 2-Disc Edition.   Which one to get? I have both so I feel qualified to answer this.   The new DVD includes all the features found on the original DVD, except the actor profiles.  The new DVD once again includes the restored print but is apparently a new transfer from the restored print.  However, according to a report that I have read, the new transfer is not perfect and has aliasing problems throughout.  The average watcher probably won't pick up on this detail.  If this is an issue to you, purchase the original edition DVD where the transfer has been given two thumbs up!      The advantage of the special 2-Disc Edition DVD  is that it includes a 58 minute 1994 documentary hosted by Jeremy Brett (Audrey's love interest in the film).  Jeremy is no longer with us, so it's nice to have this as a piece of nostalgia. On top of this, there are many more features on this disc that aren't included on the original DVD such as footage from the film's premiere, production dinner, as well as discussions with Rex and Audrey.    The choice is easy.  If you're a fan of the film and don't care for all the extras, buy the original DVD.  You at least get the best transfer.  If you do care about having all the extras, buy both!
B000267JQK|3.0|Ok so the hordes of radio friendly white boy rock has been a plauge since record tycons ran out of bands to mine way back when the likes of SilverChair and Bush and Candlebox were thrown into the ring in the wake of Cobains death.<BR>There has been some time in between over the years since the latter fill-in groups wore out their welcome where an odd assortment of trends have come and gone the most recent being that of the late great nu metal.<BR>Which has now morphed into a quasi distorted monster of many white guy radio rock trends stemming from grunge enter Staind, Cold,Creed,Saliva so on and so forth and oh yeah Seether.<BR>I loved Stainds 1st Tormented and its follow up Dysfunction after that forget it its all formula.Same with Cold love their debut the rest are crap.As for the Creed and Saliva lets move on to seether cause I actually fell for this...the second time around...maybe it was the dvd?!<BR>Honesty these guys have some potential here the songs on Disclaimer 2 are very hit and miss.<BR>Some of the songs are compassionate,honest and hard some are formulated to reach a wider audience and others are vacant fillers that have no place...they are crap...press skip ASAP because these buggers are the longest ones on the disc.<BR>I hope these guys dont jump for the golden ring too soon cause deep down these songs ache to be something better and I beleive that Seether are capable of making a really good follow up.

0743454529|5.0|If you loved The Lovely Bones -- pick this up immediately!<br />This is an emotionally wrenching yet uplifting story of a 13 y/o girl (Anna) who is conceived after her sister Kate is diagnosed with a deadly form of leukemia.  <br />Anna is genetically designed to be a perfect match for her sister.  She's born to be a donor, starting with stem cells from her umbilical cord.  The family's life revolves around Kate's illness, leaving the oldest Jesse, to move into an apartment over the garage and live the life every teen dreams of - smoking, drinking and basically ignored by his parents.<br />The story begins when Anna sues her parents for medical emancipation as Kate is suffering from kidney failure and needs a transplant. Anna finds a lawyer, with plenty of issues of his own, to represent her.  The Judge assigns her a \\"guardian ad litem, who will be Anna's advocate.  The story is told in alternating chapters from each of the characters' point of view.<br />The range of emotions the various characters demonstrate from self-pity to terror to rage, from loneliness to fear to love are realistic and heartbreaking.  The twist at the end will leave you breathless.<br />This book is going on my top 10 list.  Absolutely wonderful. I've never read Jodi Picoult before, I'm going to try her back catalog immediately.
B00005T7I1|3.0|This film comes together much better than I expected. I think that Warren Beatty, an otherwise terrific actor, lacks something as Dick Tracy. He's too sober. I once read that someone thought Bruce Willis would have been perfect as Tracy. I think that that casting would have made this film a classic....a missed opportunity. I still recommend it as great fun.
B00005JKHN|5.0|One of my favorite movies (animated or nonanimated).  THere is a quality and rich story that seems lacking in so many of todays movies (Disney movies included).  The music just lifts you up and carries you into the Princess's world, and the ending leaves you with a pleasant sigh without being totally predictable.  If you liked the Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast, you'll love this.
B000002J03|5.0|Man what can I say, amazing CD, been hooked on Led now for 2 or 3 months and every new Zep CD I buy i get addicted too. This is a amazing CD, Starting off with Whole Lotta Love a awesome song for both Plant and Page, the guitar riffs rock, and Pages singing is at its best. Then What is and What Should Never Be, I loved this song its just amazing. Next The Lemon Song, the first part is great, with awesome guitar, the last part isnt too clean though, not a huge deal and i still love this song but not my fav number. Thank You is a great tune, Then Heartbreaker and Living Loving Maid, super songs, again not the cleanest but amazing guitar as always and super singing. Ramble on, again not my fav Zep tune but still great, Then Moby Dick, words cannot explain this song, amazing John Bonham proves he is and was the greatest drummer to live. And lastly Bring It On Home, good song great Plant vocals. To sum it up I would say this is Jimmys CD the guitar riffs are like non other absolutly fabulous.
B0001AP12G|4.0|The Louis Vuitton Don Shows Promise <br />Kanye West has produced a near perfect album, full of infectious beats, with songs ranging from college experiences (School Spirit), religion (Jesus Walks), and family memories (Family Business). The overlying theme found throughout this album is the experiences of the everyday man. Kanye gives off the vibe of a normal, average guy, and portrays events in daily life that most people go through, and therefore that most people can relate to. That is the strongest point of his album, more than his amazing beats or his various guest appearances, or even the hilarious skits. <br />The overall structure of the album as a whole seems pretty well laid-out with the skits serving more to enhance his songs rather than get in the way. He touches upon a broad range of issues, and seemingly places them all within the same context, which allows the songs to flow smoothly from one to the next (Ok, except for Breathe In Breathe Out). Basically, this is an album of a guy who satirizes the idea of higher education, and shows that there is much more to life than merely obtaining a tangible degree that does not guarantee anything in life. <br />This album was great, but not perfect, not 5 mics, only for the fact that Kanye could have rapped a little more. He has various credible guests appear on his songs, but the album would have been more solidified if he had rhymed a bit more. He has some ingenious material, such as the Michael Jackson bit, and &quot;Thru the Wire&quot; was full of a number of play-on-words, but some songs lacked his lyrical creativity. All in all, this was a great rookie album, and I can't wait to see what he has in store for his sophomore followup. By the way, does anyone else get the vibe that Kanye is the 2004 version of Puff Daddy, circa late-1990s?<br />Best Song: Thru the Wire
B00006690G|4.0|I was never impressed with Eminem when he first came out with Slim Shady. It was music that the loser, pissed off kid in the corner of the high school gym listened to. I was on the underground tip with Dilated Peoples' &quot;The Platform&quot;, Swollen Members' &quot;Balance&quot;, etc. I dug some mainstream stuff like old school Jay-Z (Reasonable Doubt), Nas (Illmatic), and Tupac. Eminem rapped about raping his mother and killing his wife in front of his daughter. I wonder to this day why somebody would get enjoyment out of listening to some of those songs released on his 2nd(Slim Shady) and 3rd(Marshall Mathers) L.P.s<br />Then something strange happened, Eminem released an intelligent, introspective, angry, politically charged, and seductive album with sick beats and an aggressive flow. In short, he used a gimmick to get on top and now that he's there, he's not messing around with his talent. He's an amazing artist and now that he's made his millions, he wants you to know it. This album is defined by contradictions and that is precisely what makes it attractive.<br />He viciously attacks the very hand that has fed him as well as foreign policy and the war on terrorism with his song &quot;White America&quot;. Em addresses the state of hip hop in the bouncy track &quot;Business&quot; and throws in a little braggadocia. He attacks his mother, his inner issues about his upbringing, and his insecurities on &quot;Cleaning Out My Closet.&quot; He attacks Bush and the war on terror again with &quot;Squaredance,&quot; warning kids that the threat is real as well as takes some time to tell Canibus how he feels about him and threaten his life. There's an angry, humorous commentary about STD's on &quot;Drips&quot; where I felt like Em got a little too violent but Obie drops one of the most hilarious verses I've heard. There's the single &quot;Without Me&quot; which is one of the only tracks I skip. This is followed by a truly inspired song &quot;Sing For The Moment.&quot; Eminem raps with an urgency not many MC's can get across in their music.<br />Hailie's Song Quote:<BR>&quot;Just know that I grow colder the older I grow<BR>This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold<BR>And this load is like the weight of the world<BR>And I think my neck is breakin'<BR>Should I just give up<BR>Or try to live up to these expectations?<BR>Now look<BR>I love my daughter more than life in itself<BR>But I got a wife who's determined to make my life livin' hell<BR>But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt<BR>So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else<BR>But the years that I've wasted are nothin' to the tears that I've tasted.&quot;<br />Eminem spits fire right up until the climax with 'Til I Collapse, which is one of the most intense pieces of rugged hip hop I've heard in recent years. &quot;The criminal, cop killin hip-hop villian/A minimal swap to cop millions of 'Pac listeners/You're comin with me, feel it or not you're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us.&quot;
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park's &quot;Meteora&quot; is one amazing album. They have built on the sound they developed for their first album, but they keep pushing themselves to create a stronger, more raw and complete sound. Rather than hearing a haphazard mix of guitars, drums, vocals, and dj scratching found in less-successful metal acts, you hear more of a powerful blend of emotion that sometimes cannot be described in words. It just doesnt make any sense. Every instrument seems to feed off the effects of the others, even with the dj being used as a prominent instrument, and thus a unique sound is created. LP has also progressed in a sense that it has lost some of the pop-pre-packaged sound that was found in Hybrid Theory. Though there are some obvious radio-friendly hits found on the album, Meteora seems to have been crafted to be a strong album rather than a collection of pop hits. <br />The band has definitely progressed with this album, but it still maintains its controlled ferocity in their songs, and definitely has not mellowed out, or sold-out to create a more easy-listening pop sound. Chester Bennington's vocals remain strong as ever, and they are complemented perfectly by Mike Shinoda's rapid-fire lyricisim, skills that may be largely underestimated and that you should definitely not sleep on. The guitars are sharp and the drums dont miss a beat. Dj Hahn's turntablist skills are tight as ever, as evidenced in his solo &quot;Session.&quot; <br />The perfect example of LP's progression as a group is track #9, Breaking the Habit. This song is just amazing in how it utilizes such a wide variety of sounds, including a full-on orchestra, a sound that adds to the beautiful effect of the song, but can hardly be noticed unless listened to with headphones. When I first listened to this song, I was surprised to hear the strings of the orchestra incorporated with the steady drum beats and guitar riffs of LP, and it was quite a sensory experience.<br />Linkin Park has succeeded in pushing itself, and not letting it settle for easy, pop-sounding tracks that would definitely attract a broader range of listeners. It is this progression that will always keep them at the top of their game.  <br />Best Song: Breaking the Habit
B00004ZAV3|3.0|The Beatles attempted to top themselves once again, this time releasing another greatest hits compilation entitled The Beatles 1 that consists of all their chart toppping singles realeased in Britian and the US.<br />It contains classics such as \\"Penny Lane\\", \\"I want to hold your hand\\" and \\"Yesterday\\".  But it is the songs that never made it to #1 that are more memorable in Beatles lore.  From the tense and all too true \\"A Day in the life\\", to the dreamy and spacey \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" and the beautiful \\"Paris love\\" feel of \\"Michelle\\", these songs were classics that never made it to #1 but they were nonetheless just as groundbreaking.  Not to mention \\"Twist and Shout\\" and \\"I saw her standing there\\" which also never made it to #1 on the Billboard charts because the top spot was already taken by another Beatles classic \\"Love Me do.\\"<br />The thing you have to remember about singles is that they are picked out from the bunch because they are the catchiest song on the CD yet they usually don't display the breadth and diversity of the CD as a whole.<br />Consider the usual disappointment you experience when you excitingly buy a groups CD because you loved the single they released, only to find out that the whole album only contains 1 or 2 other good songs.<br />The Beatles 1 has the feel of their earlier and much more poppish albums, the teenage love and angst that made them famous.  But it seems to entirely skip over their darker and much more complex music from their later albums that made them legends.  The Beatles 1 contains no songs from Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club voted the #1 album of all time by Rolling Stone Magazine and it contains only two songs from Revolver, voted #3, and no songs from The White Album, the Fab Four's most heralded Beatles LP.  The Beatles 1 also excludes all songs from Rubber Soul, my personal favorite Beatles album and probably their most career defining.<br />If you really want to buy a compilation album I'd recommend getting either the blue boxed doubled CD set which contains their hits from their later years entitled 1967-1970 along with the Red cased album that contains hits from their early years entitled 1962-1966, because these two CDs gives you a combination of both the heavier later Beatles sound as well as the light Beatles sound, as opposed to the primarily popish sound on The Beatles 1. <br />But personally I would skip the compilations altogether and go straight to career albums because they recorded so many and each one had a uniquely different feel.  This saves you the money of buying a greatest hits album.<br />Start right where they did with their first album Please Please Me and then go on from there.<br />You see The Beatles weren't just one band; they were like twelve.  They went through so many different stages in there famed musical career that it is impossible to mold their career onto one CD.  And trust me once you buy one you'll be hooked and want to get them all.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|Even though the preview made the movie look interesting, I was amongst the faction of people that wasn't sure if Ashton Kutcher could pull off a role where he wasn't playing a bonehead.  I am happy to say I was really wrong.<br />Yes, this movie is disturbing and deals with a lot of issues that leave you with a knot in your stomach, but the concept, although somewhat familiar, is also different from a lot of movies. <br />Most people can say that at least once, and sometimes more than once, they wished they could go back to an event that they didn't remember too fondly, and change it.  In &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot;, Evan (Ashton) shows what can happen when you try and change various events (some traumatic) in your life, and what can happen, as a result, when you try and change events in the past. <br />The casting of Amy Smart &amp; Ashton Kutcher (although neither was supposedly a first choice) might seem a bit &quot;off&quot; at first glance, but both Amy &amp; Ashton did a great job portraying characters that were visibly different every 15-20 minutes.  The younger characters were also cast very well and are quite plausible as the &quot;younger&quot; versions of the main characters.<br />This movie is not for the weak at heart, as a lot of the sequences might disturb you, but it is well worth the ride.  Although the ending of the director's cut leaves you feeling kind of empty and is really disturbing, both versions are worth watching.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Reign in Blood is without question one of the best and most important metal albums ever released. This album marks the first Slayer album with Rick Rubin at the helm, and his expertise shows. With Rubin's guidance, Slayer was able to make the fastest and most extreme album ever produced. From the unbelievable riffs of the opening track, the infamous Angel of Death, to the progressive assault of Raining Blood, this album is an absolute assault. The talent of Slayer cannot be denied. Lombardo plays the kit with inhuman precision, while King and Hanneman's dual guitar solos speed along with ruthless aggression. Araya is also in fine form, with some of the most convincing vocals I've ever heard. Here's a rundown of the twelve tracks:<br />1. Angel of Death: An unbelievable way to start the album. Speeds along at over 200 bpm. The dual solo at the end is absolutely jaw-dropping. 10/10<br />2. Piece by Piece: The important second track doesn't disappoint. While there aren't any solo's, it's a very good track. 8/10<br />3. Necrophobic: Un ultra-fast song clocking in at under two minutes. One of my favorites, it's a shame Slayer doesn't play this live often. 10/10<br />4. Altar of Sacrifice: Another amazing track. Very disturbing lyrics. Tom is very convincing as he yells out &quot;Enter to the realm of Satan!&quot; halfway through. (For the record, none of Slayer are Satanists) 10/10<br />5. Jesus Saves: Marking a change of pace as Slayer slows down for the intro to this song. I love the build-up to the normal ultra-fast pace of the CD. 10/10<br />6. Criminally Insane: Another slow-starter, Criminally Insane never really manages to reach the pace of the rest of the album. It is not a bad song however. 8/10<br />7. Reborn: While the guitar work is simple, the vocals are extremely catchy and well-done. Tom Araya does very well here. 8/10<br />8. Epidemic: The most underrated song on the album. The song is much more complex structure-wise than most other songs on the album, and the guitars mix it up halfway through. An undiscovered classic. 10/10<br />9. Postmortem: As the Amazon reviewer mentioned before, Postmortem's hook is unescapeable. The beginning is very catchy, but soon falls into a more traditional structure. This all changes when Tom let's out a blood-curdling scream (&quot;await the final Call!&quot;) From here on out, Slayer speeds through to the conclusion. Works best as an intro to Raining Blood. 10/10<br />10. Raining Blood: A total classic. Taking a more progressive approach than other songs on the album, Raining Blood builds to a ferocious conclusion. A great way to end the album. 10/10<br />11. (Bonus Track #1) Aggressive Perfector (fast version): Wow. Slayer took an old song and made it much better. A bit more accessible than the rest of the album, this is great song to use to get people interested in Slayer. 10/10<br />12. (Bonus Track #2) Criminally Insane (remix): In my view the weakest track on the album. I think the album would be better without it, but you can't really complain about a bonus track. 7/10<br />In conclusion, Reign in Blood is an absolute must. Well-worth your money.
B000002LSV|4.0|ZZ Top- Greatest Hits(1992).<br />Right around the beginning of MTV, one band in particular, ZZ Top, took advantage of Music Videos, blending humor with a catchy mix of Southern, Blues, and Arena Rock, instantly propelled them into superstardom. The infectious trio was comprised of Billy Gibbon(Vocals and Guitar), Frank Beard(Drums), and Dusty Hill(Bass)who came together bymixeing addictive riffs and gravelly vocals courtesty of Gibbons, Top-Notch drumming from Beard, and catchy basslines from Hill. From the Early 70's to the Early 90's, ZZ Top was a hit machine, so it's understandable that many compilations have been made. So how does ZZ Top- Greatest Hits measure up?

B0001ZMWQO|1.0|I can't believe I'm the only person I know who noticed that the main riff, which carries the entire song, of &quot;Take Me Out&quot; is a blatant ripoff of Led Zep's &quot;Trampled Underfoot&quot;. I'm so tired of bands becoming popular by stealing old music and re-releasing it to people who aren't old enough (or are far too lazy/stupid) to have heard it the first time around. I have a huge problem with bands becoming famous by stealing other people's work, and it surprises me that no one else I know has noticed this none-too-subtle musical theivery. PLEASE, DO NOT BUY THIS RECORD!!!
B00000DFTG|5.0|Reunion(1998). Black Sabbath's Third Live Album.<br />On December 4th, 1997, 4 of the most renound Metal Gods came together for one final Black Sabbath performance: Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward. Thinking they could make a quick buck, the original four members and thousands of fans amassed in Birmingham's NEC Arena, for just one last chance to see Heavy Metal's creator one last time. Although they had met for a Live Aid concert in 1985 and a 4-song appearance at Ozzy's 1992 &quot;Farewell&quot; concert, the &quot;Reunion&quot; concert was their first full-length concert in 13 years, and was most likely the last time they would be seen together. Previous live releases, such as Live At Last(Bad Sound Production) and Live Evil(Dio singing Ozzy songs!) had their faults, but Reunion fully captures Sabbath in their prime, still able to play at blistering  speeds after 20 years, with Ozzy's vocals still echoing sarcasm, Iommi's riffs and solos reaching technical ecstacy, Ward's drumming spot-on, and Butler's bass still resounding doom, Black Sabbath is spot-on, and the sound production couldn't be better!<br />Track Listing-<br />&quot;Reunion&quot;'s Track Listing is phenomenal, picking songs from the original 8 albums, Black Sabbath picked the big hits, such as &quot;War Pigs&quot;, &quot;Iron Man&quot;, &quot;Paranoid&quot;, and &quot;N.I.B.&quot;. They also picked many fan favorites, such as &quot;Sweet Leaf&quot;,&quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot;, &quot;Children of the Grave&quot;, &quot;Fairies Wear Boots&quot;, and &quot;Black Sabbath&quot;. Then, completely out of left field, Black Sabbath picked many random songs from their past, and improved on them immensely, creating some of the best songs on &quot;Reunion&quot;. Those tracks are &quot;Behind the Wall of Sleep&quot;, &quot;Electric Funeral&quot;, &quot;Spiral Architect&quot;, &quot;Into The Void&quot;, &quot;Orchid/Lord of This World&quot;, and &quot;Dirty Women&quot;. Plus, as an added treat, &quot;Reunion&quot; offers up two amazing Studio Tracks, &quot;Psycho Man&quot; and &quot;Selling My Soul&quot;, that easily earn their place among Sabbath's all-time classics.<br />Band Performance-<br />While Ozzy's vocals may be terrible on recent live releases as Live At Budokan, his vocal performance here is spot on, as he never misses a beat, and his oddly sarcastic vocals are anything but hollow even after 2 Decades of music. Tony Iommi is amazing here, with his blistering riffs and solos coming almost naturally, and at times easily besting the original songs, as he deftly adds solos, so an average song contains 2-3 solos each! Bill Ward and Geezer Butler never sounded better, and while their performances aren't outstanding, they play spot-on and never miss a beat, immensely adding to the performance. Overall, Black Sabbath is in top-form here.<br />Sound Quality/ Crowd-<br />Unlike most Concert Bootlegs, Reunion sounds crisp and clean, with all the instruments and vocals easily hearable, and feedback from the instruments is kept to a minimum, and truly everything here sounds outstanding. Ozzy and the Crowd interact quite often, the crowd singing back to Sabbath quite often, and humming right along. Just listen to &quot;Iron Man&quot; and &quot;Paranoid&quot; if you want a good example!<br />Overall, Reunion stands as a Live triumph, and is a great addition to any Black Sabbath fan. All the songs on here are different than their album counterparts, many of them being longer and showcasing Iommi's skill more in-depthly than the albums, so this is a must for Sabbath fans, even if you don't like Live material!<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

B000056N8X|1.0|This movie is terrible. They completely ruin the character of Connor MacLeod. The villain is a total wimp who Connor or Duncan could've squashed like a bug. Nobody would be scared of that pencil neck!!! The story is choppy, the timeline is totally inconsistent, and the main characters act completely out of character. The makers of this film almost go out of they're way to be completely inconsistent with everything about this franchise. To be honest, the only thing they got right was the first movie. Part two was a joke, Final Dimension is above average, the TV series is very good but not plausible because CONNOR MACLEOD WON THE PRIZE AT THE END OF THE FIRST FILM!!!! Now there are thousands of immortals running around! <BR>Really, this film is just like a long episode of the tv series only its not that good. This movie had so much potential but Davis and Panzer blew it. Once again the Highlander fans have not been taken serious. Once again the studios completely butchered what could've been a very good film.
B000089RVR|5.0|Really great CD it's perfect! Didos best by far.
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|Many thought this band was finished when the Fish man left. But boy did they grow. I saw them live when Seasons End was released and Steve Hogarth blew me away with his on stage performance.<br />Ever since then, Marillion has grown into something unique. Steve Rothery's guitar remains as haunting as ever, echoing over Mark Kelly's keyboards and blending with Pete Trewavas' bass riffs. Hogarth's vocal talent, for me, has been what Marillion needed. Fish fits into the old Marillion but Steve dominates the new.<br />Marbles continues to prove that Marillion have what it took, what it takes and what they need to continue for years to come.<br />If you are old school Marillion and haven't bought an album since 'Clutching....' then Marbles is a great way of getting you back.
0679745203|5.0|The English Patient is not for everyone, only for people who want to drown themselves in an opus of words. It is a love story, but it's about the love of desert solitude, of great art and sculpture and literature, of history, of defusing bombs, of stealing artfully, of caring for the dying, of old monasteries, of peoples and tribes and cultures, of passions, and, most of all, of friendship -- and about how love is destroyed by war, nationalism, conventions, and the madness of jealousy
B00018D44U|5.0|It's only natural for an artist to experience backlash, especially when they have an album that swept the Grammies and sold millions of copies all over the world. In Norah Jones's case, however, does the backlash really matter? Sure, some people may complain about her and say that she isn't &quot;real music&quot;, but really, does any of that matter? Norah is a class act and people can say all the negative things about her they want, but just take a look at this album's ranking on the Amazon sales charts and you will see that this backlash against her means absolutely nothing. This album has already sold millions of copies and you can bet it will continue to do well, especially at Grammy time.
B00008H2LB|1.0|david cross once said, \\"these guys sound like they stood outside of 7th grade girl gym locker rooms and wrote down what they overhear and put it in their music\\" david, thank you for summing it up in an easy understanding way for all of us
0345446798|5.0|Lots of good information about what's going on in your dog's head &amp; what should be going on in your head.
B000002HMH|1.0|hang it up, or come up with a new name because you're not metallica anymore. i totally understand people getting older and obviously it would be even more ridiculous for these guys in their late 30's early 40's to still be screaming about jumping in fire. metallica is just a midlife crisis now.
B000062YAZ|3.0|Just looking through my metal collection, trying to decide what to listen to, and I happened upon this acknowledged classic... and I finally decided to sit down and write about what has always bugged me about this album...or at least this particular issue of it, which has held sway in the catalog for many years now.<br />In violation of Amazon's &quot;review guidelines&quot; (sorry, Amazon, there's no getting around the fact that price is a legitimate factor in an album review) this review has little to do with the music on this album. It has always surprised me that amid all of the raves about this album, it is seldom, if ever, mentioned, what an unbelievable rip-off this issue of it is. It especially surprises me, when you consider how &quot;anti-commercialism&quot; most extreme metal fans profess to be. Who, at the record label, thought it was a reasonable value to issue a 28-minute album with only two insignificant &quot;bonus&quot; tracks that barely get the total playing time to 35 minutes...AND charge full price for it! Does anyone think this is a rip off, or is this album too much of a &quot;sacred cow&quot; in the annals of metal to mention what a lousy value--and what a glaring example of the music industry at it's consumer-screwing worst--this reissue is! If the label is unable to acquire the rights to one of Slayer's previous albums--such as the Haunting the Chapel EP--to pair with RiB, then they need to reduce the price of this album, accordingly, and get rid of these insultingly lame &quot;bonus tracks.&quot; This is a classic example of commerce using the &quot;supply and demand theory&quot; as an excuse to screw the consumer: if it weren't such a metal icon, this EP-length &quot;album&quot;--in fact I have several &quot;extreme metal&quot; EP's longer and cheaper (and btw better) than this--would only be about ten bucks...hell, most Van Halen albums are longer than this (even Diver Down--ouch)! Also, shame on the band, to some degree, for allowing this rip-off to be perpetrated on the fans to whom they are supposedly so appreciative. <br />If you don't already have this album, buy it used, or have someone &quot;burn&quot; it for you. In its current form, it is not worth full price, &quot;classic metal album&quot; or not.
B000089RVX|1.0|If you all want to hear how it is really done listen to anything by a Finnish band called Nightwish.  Evanescence is just a cheap American pop clone.  Now that you all know my true feelings I will also say that people should really stop reviewing things multiple times to raise or lower a rating, that is just plain childish.
B000002572|5.0|This spaceship called BOSTON landed in my mind in the late 70s.Since then I have been a BOSTON fan for more than ten years.This first album captures the solidness and excellent melodies that blow our body and soul.Rock music can express the spacy feelings without utilizing the synthesizers.TOM SHULZ has the wide range of musical capacity and musical ideas.Those specific abilities made BOSTON world wide phenomenon.This elaborate contrived album is the masterpiece we must pay attention to.
0743243315|5.0|Monica Ali has a tremendous talent for creating characters who exemplify the doubts &amp; struggles we all face in life. Her descriptions of places, from London to the villages in Bangladesh, teem with vivid detail. She tells her characters' stories not by dumping the details on the page in plain sight, but rather by implying things; she does not take her reader for a fool. This book was such a joy to read. I learned a lot about a different culture, &amp; I loved that the characters are not perfect but do have flaws, yet they live by principles which make you respect them as people. Her strength in writing can perhaps be seen best in the character of Chanu, who despite being deeply flawed, is still very sympathetic. It is her ability to capture the complexity of real life that amazed me page after page. I have not read such a wonderful book since &quot;The God of Small THings&quot; by Arundati Roy. I can't wait for Ali's next book!
B000002KKX|5.0|In Japan,this artist is compared to the famous singer ODA KAZUMASA.These two singers have one thing in common.<BR>They both have excellent,soothing,gentle voice given by GOD.<BR>You can hear polished adult oriented sound here and there.Refined melodies provided by CROSS lead you to the pleasant paradise like clouds floating in the sky.If you like BOZZ SCAGGS , you will like this too.This well-balanced vocal album is the peak of CHRISTOPHER CROSS.
B00024I31C|2.0|Sometimes you hear an album and it's like being with an old friend you haven't seen in a long time. Unfortunately, this is not the case with this album. Having been a fan of Mr. Cales for over thirty years, I was very disappointed. The songs on this album are a muddled echo of his previous work. Newer fans and paid critics may find this album enjoyable but I have no desire to listen to it again.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|&quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is another one of those boring movies that gets praised by film critics who think it is very deep and meaningful. It reminded me a lot of Stanley Kubrick's films &quot;2001&quot; and &quot;The Shining&quot;. All three of these films are beautiful to look at, but they are otherwise empty in content. About an hour into this movie, I found a book to read. Nothing interesting or exciting happened during the whole movie. It just seemed to be &quot;there&quot; and did not have a real story to it. What I saw in this movie was a middle-aged man who was bored and lonely. This movie really made me miss the Bill Murray that I loved in &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;. The wit, fun, and cynicism that he showed in &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; was gone in &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;. It made me feel sad.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I love Incubus. You know what song made me a fan?..*gasp*..&quot;Drive&quot;! I know there's a tendency with Incubus fans to think that everything they did before &quot;Drive&quot; became popular was awesome (which it was), and everything they've done since then has been terrible (which is hasn't). When &quot;Morning View&quot; came out in October of 2001, lots of people accused them of &quot;selling out&quot; or &quot;going soft&quot;. The album definetly has a consistent mellow tone that their previous albums lacked, but it was expected; the album was recorded at a beach house in Malibu (or some exotic location). It's kinda tough to be angry in that type of picturesque setting. People also accused them of purposely trying to replicate the sound of &quot;Drive&quot; by writing softer songs, but &quot;Drive&quot; didn't blow up in popularity until spring/summer of 2001, when this album was probably 90% completed already.<br />The point is, it's a natural evolution in sound. Either embrace it, or go listen to S.C.I.E.N.C.E and stop whining. I'd much rather see a band evolve and expand their sound, as opposed to making the same album over and over again (kind of like Godsmack, Linkin Park, and other modern rock mainstays do).<br />Anyway..<br />1. Nice To Know You<br />The second single, IIRC. And it's a perfect example of what makes Incubus such a great band - here's a song with an unusual mixed time rhythm, lots of tempo changes, and weird lyrics (about lead singer Brandon Boyd regaining feeling in his arm again after an extended period). Yet, the chorus has an incredible hook, making the song totally radio friendly. <br />2. Circles<br />Heavy verses with a heavy melodic chorus. Nice harmonies in the &quot;What would it mean to you&quot; part. Like another reviewer said, it's reminiscent of the Chili Peppers.<br />3. Wish You Were Here<br />The first single. Not a Pink Floyd cover either. The verses are mellow, and full of metaphorical imagery by Brandon Boyd (a highly creative and underrated lyricist), which lead into the catchy, anthematic chorus. <br />4. Just a Phase<br />The best Incubus song ever, in my view. After an extended turntable/piano led intro, the song switches tempo (from 4/4 into 6/8) for the verse. Then it switches tempo again for the pre-chorus, etc. Basically, the song builds and builds, then the final chorus explodes with a wall of guitars. It's a wildly successful experimental song.<br />5. 11 AM<br />I kinda expected this to be a single. Like &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, another mellow mid-tempo song with a memorable chorus. <br />6. Blood on the Ground<br />This sounds like something from &quot;Make Yourself&quot;. Brandon Boyd rapidly spits out great lyrics in the verses, leading into the explosive, angry chorus. <br />7. Mexico<br />A totally accoustic number - no percussion or anything. It's actually a pretty heartbreaking ballad, with great emotional vocal delivery. <br />8. Warning<br />This was another big hit single. Again, it's radio friendly and catchy, but unlike other rock bands that get heavy rotation today, it's not full of generic power chords and angst-filled lyrics. <br />9. Echo<br />I didn't care for this one initially, but after 4 or 5 listens, it became one of my favorites. It's actually a little reminiscent of &quot;Stellar&quot;, but mellow the whole way through.<br />10. Have You Ever<br />A heavy song..probably my least favorite on the album. Musically, it doesn't stand out much, but the lyrics are really good.<br />11. Are You In?<br />This one makes you feel like you're in the midst of a party with all your friends. Catchy, cool, and very jazzy (jazz pop I suppose). It gets a little repetitive after awhile, but still a good song.<br />12. Under My Umbrella<br />Of all the heavier songs on the album, this is my favorite. It works the soft/loud dynamic perfectly, and the bridge is really cool.<br />13. Aqueous Transmission<br />Along with &quot;Just a Phase&quot;, the most experimental song on here. And it's another success. It's 8 minutes long, *extremely* mellow (you'll feel like you're floating down a river at night as you listen to it), and features a sitar (the main &quot;riff&quot;), a Japanese pan flute (giving it a very oriental feel), strings, and even crickets chirping at the end. It's totally ethereal and wonderful. <br />And that wraps up &quot;Morning View&quot;. Don't listen to some of the harsh criticism for this album. It's a fantastic collection of songs that takes creative guitar licks (from the also highly underrated Mike Einziger), creative lyrics, and overall creative musical ideas, and combines them with lots of memorable melodies and hooks. Thus, it *is* a radio friendly (or &quot;mainstream&quot;) album..but it's also innovative and experimental at the same time. That's what makes &quot;Morning View&quot; such a great success.<br />Best Songs: Just a Phase, Echo, Under My Umbrella, Aqueous Transmission.
B00005LC4B|1.0|The 1991 remake of &quot;Cape Fear&quot; is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Not only because it's graphically violent, but also it's horribly acted by most of its cast. I've never been a big Robert DeNiro fan, because he seems to play the same type of character in almost every movie he's in: the brutal, foul-mouthed tough guy who beats people up every chance he gets. In &quot;Cape Fear&quot;, he plays that exact character, only this time it's in a slasher film rather than a drama. Juliette Lewis also overacts as the teenage daughter and Nick Nolte fares no better. Jessica Lange is alright but forgetable. Ultimately, for those who have not seen this movie, stay away and rent a more psychological horror/thriller like &quot;Misery&quot; or the 1963 version of &quot;The Haunting&quot;.
B0001IN07Q|3.0|I bought this album about 3 weeks ago,the first time i heard his &quot;MICHAEL BUBLE&quot;album,it was 1 year ago at hmv's store in singapore.....,and it was a terrific album. since then i was so anxious to watch his live in concert dvd and Finally, i found this cd dvd album.unfortunetly, the live concert on this dvd didn't really meet my expectation of what his concert supposed to be.too many interviews and it was like watching a video clip rather than a live concert but anyways u have to watch it for yourself, and u decide !! so 2 1/2 stars for the dvd and 3 1/2 stars for the cd

B0000797IO|1.0|I have read all the other reviews for this movie and I am truly very surprised with how many people enjoyed it. I tried, really, to like this movie, but it is one movie that I truly despise. The story line in itself is unoriginal and also stupid. A woman is having a really bad life, so she starts trying to fix it, no big deal, maybe even intersting. But then her way of &quot;fixing&quot; it is to be in an affair with a strange pyscotic younger man. Not exactly what I think would qualify as fixing. This movie did not hold my attention and to this day I am sorry for the time that I will never get back that was spent watching that movie.<BR>On the plus side, the acting from Jennifer Aniston and Jake Gyllenhaal is very well done. That is the only plus side for the entire movie. Do yourself a favor and watch something you won't regret later, &quot;Office Space&quot; or &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; if you're stuck on the actors, perhaps. Both of those movies are signicantly better.
B00005JKGV|5.0|This movie is without a shadow of a doubt a piece of art. First of if you're looking for a movie that will provide for a fun evening in front of the tv, with a clear obvious storyline that doesn't provoques you...don't buy this one. This movie isn't ment to be watched...it's ment to be experienced. I've read several reviews complaining about the confusing storyline. Whell, this movie doesn't want to tell you a story. This movie want's to make you feel something. It tries to confuse you it tries to take you out of the comfort zone and into a place of doubt and confusion. If your not open for this kind of approach don't buy this. If you can't appreciate modern art cause you can't see what the painter is trying to picture and all you see is stains and shapes...don't buy this movie cause it has the same approach. If your average hollywood film is comparable to a britney spears album, this movie is David Bowie's outside. No entertainment, no cliche's but a painting with immages and story's. <br />If you do however can enjoy modern art, if you are open for a movie that want's to play with your mind instead of put it to sleep...get this movie. Don't watch it...experience it.
B00020HEG6|5.0|This is by far one of the best scores I have ever heard.  Lumos! (Hedwig's Theme) is an older favorite, but a litte bit of an extra spin on it, making it even more enjoyable.  &quot;Aunt Marge's Waltz&quot; is enough to make me laugh out loud, which says a lot considering it's only an orchestralsuite.  &quot;The Knight Bus&quot; is eccentric and wild, but extremely fun.  &quot;Double Trouble&quot; is most likely the most recognizable track, and has more of a medieval touch to it, but is a fantastic track.  &quot;Buckbeak's Flight&quot; is tied for my favorite.  It's sort of like the Fawkes number from the second movie to the third one, but less singable.  It's simply beautiful.  &quot;A Window to the Past&quot; is equally beautiful, and these two tracks alone were enough to make me want this CD.  &quot;The Whomping Willow and the Snowball Fight&quot; is also very fun, and &quot;The Portrait Gallery&quot; and &quot;Hagrid the Proffessor&quot; are cute shorter pieces.  The &quot;Finale&quot; and &quot;Mischief Managed&quot; are also spectacular pieces.<br />Overall, this is an amazing soundtrack and highly reccommended to everyone!
B000002UA9|5.0|I was a young teenager when this was released. It's good to have a digitally enhanced version of this classic available; as much of a period piece (actually way beyond the times) as timeless talent. The harmonies, tight rhythm and bass, and just plain fun abound here. The &quot;Taste of Honey&quot; is haunting; &quot;Boys&quot; is raucous youth unleashed, Beatles style. Their maturity (for a first album) is also evident (c.g. &quot;Anna&quot;). Very good rock and roll (you know them). I'm glad that I was a teeny-bopper (never really grown to date) to experience this superior level of music.
0553275976|4.0|I re-read this book just recently and loved it even more the sedcond time. Bonfire of the Vanities is a marvelous achievement: By turns, it doubles you over with laughter, causes you to pause and linger over a sublimely-written paragraph and shocks you into confronting the realities of our modern day institutions. The language is not for the faint-hearted -- beware. But as social satire and commentary, you're likely to find few equals.

B00006CXXU|5.0|CHRISTINA'S SECOND ALBUM STRIPPED IS ONE OF THE BEST CD'S EVER. I LOVED EVERYTHING SHE HAS PUT OUT, BUT STRIPPED IS THE BEST. I THINK ONE REASON IT WAS SO GREAT WAS BECAUSE OF THE DIVERSITY OF HER MUSIC. SHE SINGS EVERY TYPE OF MUSIC ON HER CD. CHRISTINA IS A DIVA!!!!! STRIPPED SHOULD HAVE WON A GRAMMY FOR ALBUM OF THE YEAR. THERE ISN'T ONE SONG I DON'T LIKE. I LOVE EVERYONE OF THEM. I CAN'T WAIT FOR HER NEXT CD. I KNOW IT WILL BE AWESOME. I LOVE YOU CHRISTINA!!!!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|So much has been said about this album, everything from &quot;she sucks&quot; to &quot;this rocks&quot;. I did write a review here just the other day, and i rated it 5 stars. Now I think its 4 stars because some of the negative reviews do bring out a loud and clear point, the girls voice is weak, and if she try and sing like Christina her lips will probably explode...<br />But remember here Britney said it loud and clear that she was a performer not a singer, she cant do what Celine Dion or Christina can, and they can do what Britney can. There are a lot of artist and genres of music that doesn't need a voice like Christina. Those are not talented in their voice have great stage presence and can drive a crowd crazy like no one can. So they all have their own talents and strong points why cant you just accept the fact that they're all talented in their own special way!? Comparing Britney and Christina just wont work because they're both different individuals with different talents.<br />So my point is, sure some of the songs may be fluff (Brave New Girl) but you have to agree its really good fluff. Anyone who can last as long as britney and sold as many albums must have a special talent, and in Britneys case, each and everyone of her songs posses this &quot;hook&quot;, there is something about britney's voice that appealing and talented.
B0000DD7LB|2.0|I'M ON HERE TO SAY THAT I AM NOT A FAN OF BRITNEY SPEARS. I NEVER HAVE LIKED HER MUSIC, BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT IN THE ZONE HAS TWO GREAT SONGS.

FIRST OF ALL SHE CAN'T SING. I HAVE TO GIVE HER CREDIT SHE IS A GREAT DANCER. I AM A XTINA AGUILERA FAN!!!!! SHE HAS A<BR>ANGELIC VOICE. IN THE END SHE WILL BE THE ONE STILL STANDING.<BR>BRITNEY NEEDS TO GROW UP AND PUT HER PRIORITIES FIRST. SHES RUINING HER CAREER. SHES LOST AND CONFUSED ABOUT LIFE.

B00003003R|4.0|Live Era is a fantastic collection of live Guns N' Roses tracks. &quot;Recorded across the universe between 1987 and 1993&quot; as the booklet says, it presents a pretty awesome portrait of the band as a live act. For those of us who were too young to catch G N'R in their prime, this set is most welcome. The song list is great, just about any Guns song you most want to hear live is included. Every track from Appetite For Destruction except for two (&quot;Think About You&quot; and &quot;Anything Goes&quot;) are performed on this CD, as well as some of the best tracks from Use Your Illusion. &quot;Patience&quot;, &quot;Used To Love Her&quot; and &quot;Move To The City&quot; from G N' R Lies are here and a cover of Black Sabbath's piano-based &quot;It's Alright&quot;. <br />The performances are high energy and hard rocking. Axl is in good voice (most of the time), Slash plays with his usual intensity, Izzy (sometimes Gilby Clarke) provides the solid rhythm guitar and Duff and Steven/Matt anchor the band very well. The only problem really is the fact that the performance dates and locations are not listed, so what performances these are is anybody's guess. Still, it's great stuff and should be welcome in any rock fan's collection.<br />Guns N' Roses was an electrifying hard rock band and these two discs give us a glimpse of what this rock behemoth sounded like at the peak of their power. Hopefully more live performances will be released from the vaults in the future. As the success of the recent Greatest Hits collection shows, the world is hungry for more Guns N' Roses.
B0001ZX0PG|3.0|I went to the local cinema with high expectations. I walked out wondering what all the fuss was about. Marcia Gay Harden(fancy Ma Kettle from COLD MOUNTAIN beating this brilliant thespian to her second Oscar????)& Tim Robbins do the best work of their careers here without a doubt. It was it's complete lack of originality that had me scratching my head in wonder. Add Laura Linney's bizarre Lady Macbethish speech & Sean Penn's unbelievably manipulative \\"is that my daughter in there?\\" scene & you have a movie so cheesy in it's \\"Americanness\\"(is that a word?), it becomes akin to watching (yet another)Kevin Costner baseball flick. For the best(& bizarrely ignored)Sean Penn performance of the year, go straight to the emotional powerhouse...21 GRAMS.
B000000OXH|1.0|Annoying. Unbearable. That´s the only words that come into my mind when thinking about the second album from ASIA. No wonder the band broke apart after this one, beginning an endless &quot;dance fo chairs&quot; with its musicians.<br />IT´s sugar pop, of course played by extremely talented musicians, but it´s sugar pop anyway. Really terrible.
B000001GPW|5.0|This classic set of Bartok's three piano concertos is also available in Anda's volume of &quot;Great Pianists&quot; on Philips, but I think this DG transfer is slightly superior.  The recorded sound favors the piano somewhat over the orchestra - I could wish for a little closer orchestral perspective - but overall the sound here is excellent.  Here are a few notes on both the music and the performances:<br />#1.  Composed in 1926, this concerto is a muscular and rather dissonant work.  The second mvt. Andante is a spooky dialogue between piano and percussion that seems to be a precursor to Bartok's chamber masterpiece:  the Sonata for 2 Pianos and Percussion.  This performance is one of the two finest I have heard;  the other was on Bartok LP 313 (the label of Bartok's son Peter, a gifted recording engineer), with pianist Leonid Hambro and the Zimbler Sinfonietta conducted by Robert Mann (better known as the 1st violinist of the Juilliard Quartet, which left stunning recordings of the Six String Quartets).  The mono sound on that disc (now available on CD) is close-up and clear as a bell, with a 2nd mvt. that is downright frightening in its primitive, wailing loneliness. <br />#2.  Completed in 1931, this concerto strikes me as the finest of the three - it's far more contrapuntal and surely the hardest to play.  In the 1st mvt., the piano takes charge from the beginning and plays almost continuously, while the strings are rather oddly silent throughout.  Anda here is incredibly bold and extroverted - he obviously had technique to burn!  The eerie 2nd mvt opening in the strings will sound familiar to anyone who has savored TV sci-fi of the 1960's:  a very similar passage was employed by Dominic Frontiere in his music for &quot;The Outer Limits.&quot;  This mvt. is half Adagio and half Scherzo, and again the piano predominates.  The Finale is an elaborate rondo which cleverly transforms the thematic/rhythmic elements heard in the 1st mvt.<br />Anda and Fricsay are wonderfully in sync throughout.  Another stunning account of this work is the &quot;live&quot; 1969 concert reading by Claude Helffer, with Ernest Bour leading the Orchestre National de France on deleted INA Vogue 672006.  That's a CD worth seeking out:  I think its 2nd mvt. is a bit more compelling than Anda/Fricsay's.  It is coupled with a really extraordinary live 1950 account of the Viola Concerto by William Primrose (for whom it was written), and the most savagely dramatic &quot;Miraculous Mandarin&quot; I have ever heard.  And perhaps DG Westminster will get around to a CD re-issue of the c.1953 recording of Concertos 2 &amp; 3 with Hungarian Edith Farnadi (daintier and more pointillistic than Anda), with remarkable conducting by Hermann Scherchen (his very slow introduction in the 2nd mvt. is disquietingly eerie).  I have not heard the Sviatoslav Richter/Lorin Maazel account (EMI) - it is said to be superb.<br />#3.  This is the only piano concerto that was not commissioned. The sick and impoverished  Bartok wanted to give his wife Ditta a work with exclusive performance rights attached so as to insure her financial future.  All but 18 bars of the concerto's orchestration was completed when Bartok was rushed to the hospital on 22 Sept. 1945 - he died there 4 days later.  His protege Tibor Serly completed it (as he also did with the Viola Concerto).  This is a gorgeous piece of music - it is Bartok's most romantic and meditative concerto.  There is a subtle interplay of folk tune elements, and the slow mvt. Adagio Religioso seems like a humble prayer (almost Coplandesque in its simple, valedictory quality), with the usual demons almost at bay.<br />Anda and Fricsay give a performance that is both virile and sensitive; in many respects, it contains this set's finest moments.  Fricsay constantly dmonstrates what an insightful and authoritative Bartok interpreter he was - if you haven't heard his Concerto for Orchestra or MSPC (both on DG), you are missing some terrific music making.  Although only in mono, those recordings are among the finest ever, along with Reiner in the former and Mravinsky and Reiner in the latter.<br />For collectors, there is also a very interesting #3 on Dante CD 158, which features a c.1948 recording by Tatiana Nikolaieva with the USSR Radio under Nikolai Anosov (who, incidentally, was father of conductor Gennady Rozhdestvensky).  It's in pretty good sound given the source and has some fine pianism and very plangent wind playing.  It is coupled with an uncut version of Tchaikovsky's 2nd Piano Concerto (my favorite reading).<br />To sum it up:  this DG set is a superb testimonial to two great Hungarian artists who shared a love of Bartok's music (they performed the 2nd piano concerto together some 60 times in concert prior to making this recording).  What a tragedy that both of them were so short-lived:  Fricsay died of cancer at 48 and Anda passed away at age 54.
B00008DDRX|2.0|The photography is really amazing, but the movie is simply boring. Al least, at the end the victory goes to Larry Wilson, not for Steve &quot;Michael Delaney&quot; McQueen, what is a good turn to the movie. (The POrsche cars wew driven by pilots such as Jacky Ickx).<br />The idea of this movie was to document the suspense, drama, power and energy of a 24-hour race at Le Mans (the 1970 edition. It accomplished its purpose, but it´s not a great movie experience.

B0000AGWJ7|5.0|I'm not going to be clich and say THIS BAND ROX!!  I'm going to be honest and say that over the last year(at least), I have not heard such innovative metal riffs, drum beats, choruses, and guitar solos all combined into one album.  Each song even has every one of those elements.  The band does seem like they put on an act with the Goth Metal look, and with the nicknames for the band members, but the lyrics are very dark and deep.  They actually remind me of Coheed and Cambria's lyrics and song structure, because they are kind of stories of made-up people.  The singer's voice sounds a lot like James Hetfield.. mostly in &quot;Unholy Confessions&quot;, and the guitar sounds a lot like Kirk Hammett in &quot;I Won't See You Tonight Part 1&quot;.  I find this interesting, but it's nice to see someone bring back Metallica's great style, since Metallica couldn't do it with St. Anger.  My favorite tracks are 2, 4, 7, 9, and 12.  I recommend this CD to fans of AFI, Coheed, Metallica (weird combination i know), and anyone who likes good guitar, drums and vocals.. i guess that includes everybody.
0425105709|3.0|The story first started off alright- all the characters were introuduced, and everything sounded interesting.<br />however, the story goes on and on and it became a bit complicated. without paying close attention, one could be easily wandered off somewhere and got lost in the plot.<br />but it isnt a bad one. recommanded to skillful readers / experienced Christie's readers.
B00005JMEW|2.0|Quentin is a self-proclaimed master of dialogue. not with this one. every time someone opens their mouth, they say something overly-dramatic. (the best [or worst] example of this would be when that japaneese girl with the ball and chain is talking to that guy in the bar. &quot;is it you that has penetrated me, or i that has penetrated you&quot;? or something very similar. that was something that made me dumber just hearing it) dialogue aside, quentin tried to make a good action movie (i think). he didnt do a great job at this either. the gore would be laughable if they tried to be campy about it, but its just lame. cottonmouth cut that one guys head off, and waited at *least* four seconds for the blood to shoot onto the celing. and when black mamba is fighting those japaneese gang members, she cuts their chests and blood shoots about twelve feet in the air. i DID think the knife fight was cool, and thats the only reason im not giving this movie a one.
6302508878|5.0|Interpretations--psychological, anthropological, social, evolutionary, racial--abound about 1933's KING KONG. &quot;King Kong is about our inner animal of rage&quot;, &quot;King Kong is a critique of man in modern urban times&quot;, &quot;King Kong is about technology killing our true nature...&quot; Ad infinitum, ad nauseum.<br />PUH-LEASE! KING KONG is simply a great story, perfectly directed, with the best animation techniques for its time. While the acting (by humans) is admittedly the weakest link in this film, it has so much else going for it, like suspense, horror, pathos, love, and tragedy. King Kong, the animal, is complex and there are different emotions we experience about him. We don't like him when he gobbles up people or smashes the 2nd Avenue el (an incredible scene!). We admire him for trying to save Fay Wray from the flashbulbs. And we feel incredibly sad when he's killed. Why? I think it's because we see him as a human, at least of having human qualities. But to extend that to some deeper, intellectual level is pointless. It's just an amazing film.<br />Last comment: The film also has some humor. As a New Yorker, I love the dialogue between the two women at the theater, waiting to see King Kong.<br />Girl one: &quot;Hey, what's this show about, anyway?&quot;<BR>Girl two: &quot;I don't know. Some big gorilla.&quot;<BR>Girl one: (after a clod accidentally steps on her toe): &quot;Aw. Ain't we got enough of them in New Yawk?&quot;<br />I can't get enough of this classic film.
0060987464|5.0|Who knew (besides Manson fans) Manson was so insightful. The book is an easy and fun read filled with well written/detailed accounts of Manson's childhood until the day he wrote the book. Also, great photography is laced into the book. Every chapter/section begins with a cool old quote from Jean-Paul Sartre, Friedrich Nietzsche  and other great philosophers. The best part of the book is when Manson talks about his time with Anton Szandor LA Vey (founder of 'The Church of Satan' ~ someone I've always been interested in) you get a better understanding of just how cool La Vey is from how Manson profiles him. =)<br />If you want a well written, fun to read, visually stunning, fascinating look into this artists' personality...then buy this book! Later, you can sell it on eBay. =)
B000060K4O|5.0|No need to tell anyone that GHOSTBUSTERS was the best comedy of the 80s (and probably better than anything in the 90s). Without resorting to adolescent potty humor (like PORKY'S or AMERICAN PIE), GHOSTBUSTERS relied on a super script, powerful directing, and the best acting jobs of the cast's careers. It did NOT rely on the special effects. As another reviewer perfectly put it, the special effects served the plot, not the other way around.<br />What I do need to tell you is that what makes this set worth the price is the gravy: all those extras, like the interviews, special effects demonstrations, and storyboards. The transfer to dvd is great and the enhanced soundtrack complete the value.
0195073401|4.0|In its coverage and depth, this book needs help from only several other books such as Fudenberg and Tirole's(Game), Freixas and Rochet's(Banking), Tirole's(IO) and Salanie's(Contract) in the standard topics of microeconomic theory.<BR>In the meantime, this big book provides relatively unified and consistent core in &quot;mathematical analysis&quot;-like terms and tones. This may make the students frustrated and bored. Simply, this problem can be fixed in only one way. &quot;Stand and Be accustomed!&quot;  <br />One thing is that we'd better get accustomed to Real Analysis, Functional Analysis, Vector Analysis and the like.
B00005JMYG|4.0|Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is a hilarious comedy with a great cast that shouldn't be missed.  In early 1970's San Diego, anchorman, Ron Burgundy, and his news team are on top.  The whole city loves them as they continue to hold the top spot in the ratings(Super duper!).  However, just when everything seems to be going the right way, a female anchor/field reporter, Veronica Corningstone, is hired.  Burgundy and his news team will stop at nothing to get rid of Corningstone so that the Channel 4 news office can return back to normal.  Not everyone will enjoy this type of humor, but if you're a fan of Will Ferrell, you will love this movie.  Plenty of off-the-wall humor, too many great lines to even mention, and some of the worst hairstyles you'll ever see.  One particularly hilarious scene, with some great cameos, has Burgundy and Co. duking it out with all the other channel's news teams in a no-holds barred street fight.  Not all the jokes work, but the ones that do are hysterical.  Highly recommended comedy about a different time that will have you rolling around.  <br />  Will Ferrell is hilarious as chauvinistic Channel 4 in San Diego anchorman, Ron Burgundy.  His character, even when arrogant and cocky, is still likable.  He fully embodies the man who reads from the teleprompter without thinking, which ends up getting him in trouble.  Christina Applegate is also very good as co-anchor, Veronica Corningstone, who tries to survive in a male-dominated news office.  The rest of the news team includes Paul Rudd as ladies man and field reporter, Brian Fantana, Steven Carell in a great part as weatherman, Brick Tambland, who has an IQ of 48, and David Koechner as sports anchor, Champ Kind.  The always funny Fred Willard plays Ed Harken, the head of the news office.  I won't say who the cameos are because it is so funny to see them in their parts, much of the time unexpectedly.  I can't wait to see the DVD for Anchorman for all the deleted scenes, outtakes, andhopefully a lot more.  Be forewarned, many of the scenes in the trailer airing on TV did not make it into the final cut, but the version shown is still great.  For a hilarious movie with a great performance by Will Ferrell, check out Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy.
0064471837|3.0|First, the good news:<br />This book is very hard to put down.  The suspense never lets up.<br />It's also quite creative in its own way.  it posits a world with two countries side by side.  In one country there is magic, but technology doesn't work.  In the other country, there is technology, but magic doesn't work.  Now, curiously, the magic country is *not* where you want to be.  In the magic country, the place is being taken over by zombies (called \\"Dead\\"), since all dead bodies come back to life unless the Abhorsen properly disposes of them.  Totally gross.  It's kind of like \\"Night of the Living Dead.\\"  Also, most of the magic people are mysteriously devoted to bringing back more and more zombies and killing the living.  It's very hard to understand their motivation to do this, but there it is.<br />The few people on the border in the non-magic country are constantly fighting to keep the zombies out of their territory.<br />Now the negatives:<br />I mean really, why would you want to have a magic country if almost all the magic is bad?  This isn't escapist at all.  It's makes you feel pretty good about your own life.<br />Also, the thing reads like a video game.  Every time the main characters turn around there's another zombie or other bad, magic creature bearing down who has to be killed instantly, otherwise, you know, the boogie man will get you if you don't watch out.  There's just no respite.  I don't like even looking briefly at that kind of video game.<br />There's also precious little character development.  It's all rushing around from one violent encounter to another.<br />Now some people seem to think that if you're only killing zombies, magical creatures, and wicked necromancers who are possessed baddies, it's not really killing somehow.  I disagree.  It's still violence, violence, and nothing but violence.<br />Then, the ending ... I won't give it away entirely, but this might be a bit of a spoiler.  Anyway, you don't really get to enjoy it.  It's awfully abrupt.<br />Another bad thing.  It's so suspenseful that you have to get the other two, so just grit your teeth & get all three.It's awfully abrupt.<br />Another bad thing.

B00000AF95|4.0|THIS ON OF THE TEN GREATEST KISS ALBUMS WITH SONGS LIKE HEAVENS ON FIRE, BURN BITCH, THRILLS IN THE NIGHT AND MURDER IN HIGH HEELS. THIS ONE IS HEAVY TOO. THE ONLY SONGS THAT NOT ARE SO HEAVY ARE HEAVENS ON FIRE AND THRILLS IN THE NIGHT. GREAT FOLLOW-UP TO LICK IT UP BUT NOT AS GOOD AS CREATURES OF THE NIGHT!-DESTROYER FAN
0060005424|4.0|This book was a big improvement over the first one, Sabriel.<br />The book has two story lines that run in parallel.<br />The first line, about Sameth, son of Sabriel, suffers from some of the same problems as the first book.  He keeps running into those masses of zombies (\\"Dead\\") all the time and when he's not outside, he's moping around his castle being picked on by his sister, which is better than running around outside with the zombies, but pretty tedious.<br />The second line, about Lirael, is *much* better.  Lirael is exploring this great library full of magic creatures and magic books.  She's trying out all kinds of things and becoming more and more powerful.  Granted she has a nasty case of depression, but she gets through it and builds herself up to be truly exciting.  I think the sequence of Lirael in the library makes the book worth while.  I could have stayed in that library forever.<br />This is a bit of a spoiler, so you might want to stop reading at this point.<br />Anyway, the bad thing is that Lirael gets out of the library and then she's out there with all those zombies and Sameth.  And there are more and more of the putrid things.  The more she kills, the more there are.  It's the ultimate sisyphean task. This series is kind of like the story of a bunch of glorified exterminators who spend their lives ridding the world of disgusting and dangerous pests.  Unfortunately, I was reading the book in a cockroach infested dormitory, which did not help.<br /><br />Still, the book has good suspense, a real page-turner, and a lot of the stuff is very creative, not at all like other fantasy books.  The land of death that Nix creates is very unusual.<br />On the whole, I recommend the book.<br />Warning: the ending is a cliff hanger.  You might as well just buy the whole series together.  It's not very likely you're going to be able to walk away from all this suspense without finding out what happened.
B000001ELR|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST KISS ALBUM . THIS A REAL 80?S HEAVY METAL ALBUM WITH NO POP FEELING. THIS IS A REAL GREAT ALBUM TOO. ALL SONGS ARE HEAVY! THE GREATEST DRUMS I'VE EVER HEARD! I MOST ENJOY ALL GENE?S SONGS AND SOME PAUL SONGS TOO. MY FAVORITE IS I LOVE IT LOUD.
0060528737|4.0|OK, Nix left you on the cliff with the previous book, so you had to get this one.  It doesn't matter if you like it or not. You're going to have to read it.  The only way to not read it is to not read Lirael.<br />Now there are some good points here.  The character development is improving.  You start to have a feel for them all, know where they stand. You get to meet the Gods of this world & a lot of it is very poetic.  The names of the Gods are graceful.  The land of the dead is captivating as well as suspenseful.  The familiar animals, Mogget & the Disreputable Dog, are a nice sort of comic relief.<br />Unfortunately, the fields of destruction and death are pretty overwhelming.  And, once again, the main characters can't turn around or take a breath without coming face to face with a zombie, in true video game like quality.  I find this constant attack, attack, attack pretty dismal after a while.<br />And, of course (though this may be a spoiler) much like Sabriel, the ending is very abrupt.  I would have liked to linger longer and savor some of it, but no.  It's just over.<br />Speaking of spoilers, the editorial review reveals the name and identity of the secret bad guy who isn't revealed until near the end of the book.  How dare they!  A lot of this book is about mystery about who is being fought & what the enemy wants.  These guys need about 1000 lashes with a wet noodle.
0312305060|3.0|While I enjoyed this book, I fear it was for all the wrong reasons.  Here's my outline of what I liked and didn't:<br />PLOT:  This was pretty much non-existent.  I fully understand Cunningham's attempt to try and replicate Virginia's writing (and frankly, who would WANT to with its stream of consciousness and ramblings--come on, it goes NO PLACE), but the thing just didn't come off for me.  It's to Mr.Cunningham's credit that this was a short book. If it had been six-hundred pages of this type of writing, I never would have made it.<br />STYLE:  The guy gets A+++++++ for this. While there's virtually no real story here, and the &quot;threads&quot; are so loose and scraggly that it's hard to tell what you're supposed to be feeling, the writing style is just incredible.  The difference between Cunningham's &quot;style&quot; and that of Woolf's?  Woolf's rambles and Cunningham as at least taken her &quot;idea&quot; and cut it down to readable sentences. This is really poetry, with some of the most beautiful sentences ever to grace a written page. Now, if only that beautiful style had been accompanied by a great plot or at least some masterful &quot;coming together&quot; of ideas, you'd have one great book.  Unfortunately, it didn't.<br />CHARACTERS:  While interesting in their own rights, I just didn't feel that they connected, regardless of the Mrs. Dalloway, suicide, unrecognized writer, etc. elements that Cunningham was attempting to put together.  In themselves, they were flawless, but as a whole there was something missing.<br />TO SUM UP:  A beautiful book in which not a lot happens.  One of the better books ever written, but certainly not worthy of the Pulitzer Prize.  Still, it's worth reading for the beautiful writing.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I'd like to start off by saying that, by my standards, a 5-star album must be perfect (i.e. perfect like \\"Who's Next\\" and not \\"Hybrid Theory\\").  So, my giving this album 5 stars is quite the complement considering how critical I am of music.    On to the album.  What makes this album so good is not the fact that Maynard is singing (I'm not dissing him- I have a great respect for him, in fact) but his contributions to the overall mood of the album as a whole.  The whole album is one giant drug record (think the Cure but about chemicals not women) and Maynard adds tension to the atmosphere by sounding haunted when he sings on \\"The Package\\" and \\"Pet\\".      Speaking of the former, I think that it's the centerpiece of this tremendous album.  The song begins with a simplistic drum beat, sludgy bass line and guitars that whisper in the background, all while Maynard sounds like he's in withdrawl.  The song builds to a climax like a great suspense novel when the guitars kick in with a crunchy riff.  Following the \\"novel\\" motif, the song then declines back into what it was in the beginning.  All in all, a very quick 7 minute song.    \\"Pet,\\" on the other hand jumps right in from the start with a 2-guitar riff: one low-end riff that sounds like it was written by Tony Iommi and the other guitar making this great accompanying wail.  The verses and choruses have this soft-loud dynamic that is shared in \\"The Package\\" with the verses being very soft lulling you to sleep (like in the lyrics) and the chorus waking you back up like a punch in the face.  All this, again, while Maynard sings about protecting someone from \\"the bogeyman\\" amongst other things.    But that's not the whole album, as evidenced by other reviews.  There are some songs that resemble the Cure more closely (\\"Blue\\" and \\"The Noose\\") and Tool- how odd- (\\"The Outsider\\")  \\"The Nurse Who Loved Me\\" is the one happy point in the album with strings, which comes as a nice break in the massive amount of umcomfortability.    The one complaint that I have is just a preference problem.  I like the remix of \\"Weak and Powerless\\" better than the album version and I wish that they would've included in on the album itself (though it is on my version).    All in all, this is an album of the purest sense: a collection of songs with a cohesiveness that modern music severly lacks.  Kudos, gentlemen.
B0000062Y2|2.0|I am a huge fan of Jesus Christ Superstar and feel that the movie version is the best of all.  This is the soundtrack of the movie and it does not do any justice to the movie at all.  The quality of the CD is terrible!  There really needs to be a re-recording and reissue because this is inexcusable.<br />If you are a fan of the movie like me, then other than watching the movie, this soundtrack is the only choice, but do not let the five star reviews fool you.  You will be disappointed.<br />If this is going to be your first introduction to Jesus Christ Superstar then please do yourself a favor, skip this CD and get the DVD instead.
B00007LTIB|5.0|Relayer &amp; Close to the Edge are (in my opinion) Yes' two best albums &amp; it would be difficult for me to choose between the two of them.  However, one advantage with Relayer is that it is the least dated album by Yes.  Close to the Edge, admittedly sounds like it was recorded in 1972.  Relayer is different.  A lot of this, I think, has to do with the fact that Patrick Moraz replaced Rick Wakeman on this album.  The irony is that, during the 70's, Wakeman was considered king, but I personally feel his use of keyboards was not as interesting as Moraz's.  While Wakeman's playing was classically-based, Moraz had more of a jazz background.  Wakeman, as Bill Bruford once said in an interview, is incapable of playing a blue note (though the one exception would be his excellent organ solo on Roundabout).  Also, Moraz's use of synthesizers doesn't sound so obviously dated.  Even as late as Tormato, Wakeman's choice of synths is so-well, cheesy.  Too bad Moraz ended up being a jerk &amp; Wakeman was in for Going for the One (and end up with Steve Howe &amp; Wakeman struggling against each other).  Don't get me wrong-when Wakeman was getting into it, he succeeded with some terrific playing also (\\"Close to the Edge\\" especially).  But Moraz's approach really demonstrated that Yes could've pushed prog-rock in a more interesting direction.  It was a great chemistry (now imagine what they would've sounded like with Bruford on the drums instead!).<br />The production on this album is fantastic.  Steve Howe plays a more central role, which is never a bad thing!  This definitely contains some of Alan White's best drumming (and not just on \\"Sound Chaser\\"), Chris Squire's bass lines rock (he has one of the most \\"erotic\\"-sounding bass playing, along with Tony Levin).  Jon Anderson is fantastic as usual (and a little scary in \\"Delerium\\").  Moraz has some excellent performances &amp; isn't always trying to throw in a lead part everywhere-he knows when to step into the limelight &amp;when to step back.  Most importantly, the band ROCKS on this album unlike anything else they've ever done!<br />Now about the music: Relayer opens with \\"The Gates of Delerium,\\" whose only other real contender as the Yes magnum opus would be \\"Close to the Edge.\\"  Within the first minute, you know this is going to be different.  The lyrics are very different from a lot of their other material-it's terrifying at times as oppressors are swept into violence which becomes all-consuming and becomes an end in itself rather than a means to an end (which is typical of practically all revolutionary movements).  The middle instrumental section is filled with all sorts of chaotic metallic crashes, and eventually ends with the mournful but hopeful ballad-like \\"Soon.\\"<br />\\"Sound Chaser\\" is very jazz like with a blinding solo by Steve Howe in the middle (not so jazz-like!).  \\"To Be Over\\" is a nice closer to the album which begins with a quiet canon of various guitars, sitars &amp; keyboards.  When the song ends, this opening theme returns with a brilliant force.  <br />For someone not too familiar with Yes, I'd recommend \\"Close to the Edge\\" or \\"Fragile\\" first, but by all means-if you're going to listen to Yes, this album is a must-have (and get the Rhino remaster).
0380789035|4.0|The majority of reviewers are right, this is a great novel and well worth reading.  The only thing I can say is that there seems to be something missing.  That something that takes a novel from being a good novel, to making it something meaningful.  When I finished the novel, I was left wondering what it all meant.<br />However, as I said before, it is a great novel and fun while it lasts.  Maybe it will speak to you more than it did me.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|I don't think Avril Lavigne has much talent. Her voice sounds alike in all the songs, and they all just mix together. After awhile all the songs are old and sound the same so I just can't stand this CD anymore. The only song on this CD I can stand is &quot;happy ending&quot; because I like the lyrics. Even though I like this song, I think it should have been song by someone else. I think it would have sound a whole lot better.
0451169514|5.0|This still stands as one of the greatest books I have ever read.  There are essentially two books.  One takes place when the characters are children and the other when they are adults.  By far the sections dealing with the characters as children are the best, simply perfect.  The second half, when they are adults, is not nearly as good, but that is only because the first half was so great.<br />I once used to think that this was Steven King at his best.  Now that I am older and have read more, I can now say that this is truly fiction at its best.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|\\"Love Actually\\" is the perfect feel good movie for anyone who has ever felt the innocence and pitter-patter of butterflies in your stomach as you fall in love.<br />This British film starts out a little shaky until you get involved with the stories behind all of the eight couples who will weave their way into the hardest of hearts. The movie contains many well known actors like Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Laura Linney and Colin Firth as well as a few cameos. It is well written and somehow all of the interesting characters end up just as they should.<br />Hugh Grant plays the British Prime Minister who falls in love with his assistant and as usual he is adorable and quirky, especially during his solo dance scene. Emma Thompson plays a wife who exists in a 13 year marriage believing it to be perfect until an unexpected Christmas gift from her husband ends up being for someone else. Your heart will break as she pulls herself together while Joni Mitchell sings softly in the background, \\"Both Sides Now.\\" Liam Neeson is a recent widower who spends the film helping his adolescent son cope with his first case of puppy love....really adorable and holding all of the innocence that young love somehow always contains. Laura Linney is the ever responsible sister of a handicapped brother who is never able to break herself away from her duties in order to pursue her love interest, although she reaches that pinnacle of greatest accomplishment in unrequited love, that perfect moment where it all appears to work. Colin Firth is a writer who falls in love with a foreign maid while trying to work. His pursuit is both funny and touching as he learns another language and obviously does not master it while pulling an entire little town into his pursuit of love and relays the fact that love really can cross those awkward barriers. All of the rest of the stories are just as intriguing and often times gut wrenching for romantics.<br />A perfect film to watch when love treats youwrong and you need to feel right. You will be reminded of all those simple treats that come with love. From innocent starry-eyed puppy love all the way through to a lengthy marriage that is safe and secure despite the wretched boredom. It shows you that love can work and even if it doesn't another flicker will always come along if you let it. The soundtrack is its own character as great background music influences many of the scenes. It is corny, campy, silly, touching, at times stiff and then again provocative....its actually all that love is in all of its various shapes and forms.
B000003TA4|2.0|I don't see whats so good about Nirvana. Kurt Cobain was a very amateur guitar player, and he set the standards for modern rock guitarists lack of talent today (80% power chords, rarely any solos). Dave Grohl was a good drummer, but he was very very overrated. John Bonhom from Zep would kick his buttox anyday. Their bass player was good yet very boring, he wasn't an exceptionally skilled bass player like Flea from RHCP or Mike Dirnt from GD. Their lyrics were meant to make you feel &quot;depressed&quot;, but I think they were just stupid. &quot;I think I'm dumb, I think I'm dumb, I think I'm dumb, I think I'm dumb&quot; I mean come on Kurt, we get the point already. &quot;Hello hello hello how low?&quot; WTF is this guy smoking? How can you call that good lyrics. Okay, some of his stuff is a little funny and clever like in Lithium, but overall its mostly stupid. I think these guys are only legendary now because Kurt killed himself. I didn't think they were anything good then, and I dont think their good now.
6302797535|4.0|Despite the (mostly) excellent cast this movie production of Neil Simon's play leaves a little to be desired.  In particular I think that director Robert Moore needed to work harder toward getting the timing of his players down pat and focusing the jokes.  I also think it was a mistake to cast Truman Capote in the role of Lionel Twain, the eccentric millionaire who invites the five world famous detectives to his estate with the idea of matching murderous wits with them and fooling them.  Although he looks the part, Capote stands out like a sore thumb amidst the much more experienced and talented cast, so much so that I almost felt sorry for him.  He pronounces his lines competently but with neither flair nor finesse.<br />The premise of the play reveals Neil Simon's satirical intent: the characters are all caricatures of famous fictional detectives: Inspector Sidney Wang (Peter Sellers ) as a Charlie Chan type; Sam Diamond (Peter Falk) as a Sam Spade type; Inspector Milo Perrier (James Coco) as a famous Belgique detective of similar name (Agatha Christie's Poirot) who could also be Georges Simenon's famous French detective (except that he cries out, \\"Not Frenchie--Belgie!\\").  The absurd plot begins as the detectives motor toward Twain's haunted, fog-shrouded castle in northern California for a dinner that is never served.  Everything is played as a farce (\\"farce --n. 1. a comedy based on unlikely situations and exaggerated effects.\\" --Random House College Dictionary) and everybody tries to ham it up.  I particularly liked Peter Sellers as the Chinese Wang with his #3 adopted Japanese son in tow.  Alec Guinness plays the blind butler (\\"The butler did it!\\") while Nancy Walker has a small part as the blind and deaf cook.  David Niven is mildly amusing as the debonaire Dick Charleston who, unbeknownst to his wife (Maggie Smith), has only a buck-seventy-some in his tuxedo pocket (and some stamps) after going through some of her millions.<br />Representative joke:  When asked by his #3 adopted Japanese son why HE has to clean up the dead body, Inspector Wang tells him, \\"Because your mother isn't here.\\"  By the way, the makeup on Peter Sellers (\\"Inspector Slanty,\\" according to Sam Diamond) is especially well done.  As usual Peter Sellers manages to look more like the character he playing than himself, so much so that one needs to do a double take to realize it is Peter Sellers at work.<br />One of the problems with a movie like this is that all the actors are trying to upstage one another and every line and pratfall is played as MY moment in the spotlight so there is little contrast around which to frame the best bits.  Still, afficionados, especially those viewing this repeatedly, will find plenty to crack up about.<br />See this for Neil Simon, one of America's most popular playwrights, whose semi-sophisticated, upbeat comedies delighted theater and movie audiences for several decades beginning in the Sixties.  I particularly loved The Out-of-Towners (1970) with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis; The Good-bye Girl (1977) with Richard Dreyfuss and Marsha Mason; and the unforgettable The Odd Couple (1968) starring Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau.  Simon and Peter Falk followed this up with The Cheap Detective (1978).  Incidentally, Falk's work here and in The Cheap Detective and in a couple of earlier Columbo movies served as a proving ground for his long-running TV hit Columbo.asked by his #3 adopted Japanese son why HE has to clean up the dead body, Inspector Wang tells him, \\"Because your mother isn't here.\\"  By the way, the makeup on Peter Sellers (\\"Inspector Slanty,\\" according to Sam Diamond) is especially well done.

B00001NFCY|3.0|These guys will probably go down as one of the best rock bands of the early 00's. This album along with their other one sold alot of copies, and they did have alot of hits. Their music isn't amazing, but I think their way better than those Nickelcrack and 3 D***s Down wannabes will ever be.
B00005U1YO|5.0|I generally listen to artists such as Squarepusher, Aphex Twin, and the like., but I found that this album really was a change from Chemical Bro's usual. It seems to be a transitional period to the band, which of course leads to experimentation. If you like this album especially, you should look into early and mid career squarepusher.... one of my favorites.
0451450523|4.0|I only wish I could have read this book before seeing the movie as a child.  The writing in the books are verbatim with most of the lines in the movie, so much so that I find it very hard to separate the two.  Thus, my imagination is infinitely jaded so that I can only see the childhood film interpretations.  Of course the story is beautiful and somewhat unconventional at that.  If this book interests you, I would encourage you to read &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;.  It too has a movie that lifted most of its lines verbatim from the text, but there's enough extra to make it much better than the film---and SO much funnier.

You must get this album!
B00000DFSK|5.0|Ok, I'm not a rock fan and I definitely don't like that goth, misogynist stuff that rock is ruined with.  Then I heard &quot;With or Without You&quot; some 15 years ago while scanning the radio dial and was captured.  The lyrics and that guitar haunted me forever and crept up on me when I least expected it - was it Slash or was it Clapton, you see I knew nothing.   <br />It was only after years of listening to classic rock radio that I became somewhat skilled at figuring it out for myself (no thanks to those radio jocks who NEVER tell you the names of the songs they play).  <br />My first rock purchase was this CD and yes I am a green rocker but this compilation, for me, has it all - powerful lyrics and  haunting riffs.  I've worn out two of them already.  Now with online help - website playlists, discographies and MP3s - I'm on my way!
B0001Z52RU|1.0|The director's cut reveals the heart of the film's message, the most gratuitously depressing story ever filmed.  Failed attempts at correcting a botched prank leads the star to a wimpy cop-out.  In a rip-off scene from 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, the embryo rotates through pastel lights as a symphony plays.  He wishes he had never been born--but don't ask how, the explanations are as unscientific and kitchy as in Orson Wells' THE TIME MACHINE.  This is a movie for 9-year old boys (and girls) who think Ashton is cool, cute, or deep.  I hope people don't waste their life by listening to this film...a superficial, obvious sermon of despair that leaves nothing to the imagination but a death wish.  Fans of the film should try marrying Courtney Love instead.<br />New Line distributes this film without any conscience, or business sense.  Aren't living customers better than dead ones, at the most crass level?  Why would anyone promote the idea that someone should never have been born.  This is a thought that must cross everyone's mind, but THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT romanticizes the notion and offers erasure as the solution: the embryo willingly commits suicide and this self-mutilation--the rejection of life--is depicted as a martyrdom.  The message is false, weak, and uncreative.  I didn't bother watching the released version of the film after seeing the director's intended message.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|Watch the director's cut.  I expected this movie to be a big turd thanks to the critics who hated it, but it's actually pretty damn good.  If you like time travel films, you should love this one.

B0001MDP36|2.0|I was excited about watching this film seeing how it got high reviews but there were two scenes in it that were totally uncalled for.  The \\"sex scenes\\" or in my opinion \\"soft core porn\\" should have been omitted.  It took away from the movie completely.  I had NO idea these scenes were in this movie.  There is also a lot of killing but then again it is based during the Civil War, which made the movie very dark. The acting was, in my opinion, superb that's why I continued to watch the movie.  I agree with another review Nicole's face looked so tight.  Almost as if she just left her plastic surgeon.
B000002J1U|5.0|led zeps third album was very good but was overshadowed by the greatness of their their first two albums.but just a listen to songs like immigrant song and friends and  will make you like it a lot and buy it.please ignore the pathetic one star reviews for this great album.you should have it along with their other albums very highly recommended.

B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye West spit it like fire Trough the Wire, taught us about a little bit of old school Slow Jamz, told us how it All Falls Down and told us how Jesus Walks. Lets face it, Kanye is a lyrical and beat genious. He's just what the rap game needs, and puts out more positive than negative messages on the CD. The best tracks on here are: The New Workout Plan which tells ladies how they should get in physical shape and feel confident, Jesus Walks and Never Let You Down sre kind of mixed together,and have a very positive meaning, Space Ship is a song that many people could probably relate to because it tells about Kanye's struggles working the graveshift and not getting paid nothing, School Spirit is short and sweet but straight, Through the Wire is a classic, and Last Call and Family Bizness have a lot of meaning to them. Bottom line, Get the CD ya'll!

Naughty Girl: In this one Beyonce sounds like someone's squeezing her lungs together or somethimg cuz the beat is hot, but her voice is not.    3. Baby Boy: Well Beyonce tried to change her nationality to Jamican for this one. Like Crazy in Love it was aiight for the first week, then got played out.    4. Hip Hop Star: This is one of the worst and nastiest songs on this CD. Beyonce need to have her mama wash her mouth out with soap after this one.    5. Be With You: Well, its official, Beyonce's a biter, but the song is tight though.    6. Me, Myself, and I: This is a nice song for women especially who are going through a tough time.    7. Yes: NO. I don't like the beat, its just too slow for the song, but I like the Message.    8. Signs: The whole astrology thing gets annoying, especially because the song is like 10 min. long.    9. Speechless: The beat is nice, nice for when you're bouts to go to bed, but for Beyonce, like hip hop star, too much sexual content for her.    10. That's How You Like It: Overall, the song is straight. It has Jay-Z of course, but i just skip over Beyonce's parts 2 get to Jay's. All beyonce says is she wants a thug, and she hopes the guy like the way she flirts.    11. The Closer I Get to You duet with Luther Vandross: A pretty song. Very enjoyable and soft.    12. Dangerously in Love pt. 2: A beautiful song, love the beat and the vocals, but Beyonce is just too dramatic like in the end how she repeats I love you, I love you for literetly 2 minutes.    13. Beyonce interlude: 16 seconds. Boring.    14. A gift From Virgo: There she goes with the stupid astrology again The vocals are barely even so so.    15. Daddy hidden track: Once again, too dramatic of vocals in the song she shoulda left this one out.

B000009ED0|5.0|Guns N'Roses are gone.  Led Zeppelin is history.  Aerosmith has been clean for years.  The Rolling Stones are living, breathing anachronisms.  Rod Stewart is a pop singer. And hip hop bands don't use live bands with loud guitars.  Is the modern music scene hopeless?<br />Nope.  It's alive and dangerous.  For those of us who miss loud guitars and controversial lyrics, Kid Rock has come to the rescue.  <br />If you are a hard rock fan and can keep from banging your head during &quot;Bawidaba,&quot; you don't have the volume loud enough.  If you don't bang your head after the piano break in &quot;Cowboy,&quot; you need to buy Pat Boone's &quot;In a Metal Mood.&quot; If you don't sing along to the bridge in &quot;Roving Gangster,&quot; perhaps you need to take your a** to the early-bird special at Denny's and take your geritol.  <br />If you miss the danger of G N'R, you'll love the drug-glorifying jams of &quot;I Am the Bullgod&quot; and &quot;Where You at Rock?&quot; <br />While I've never been a fan of hip hop, I must say I thoroughly enjoy the drug-glamorizing, braggadoccio of Kid Rock's &quot;Devil Without a Cause.&quot; Imagine the Beastie Boys merged with G n' R, Zeppelin, and Skynyrd and you have Kid Rock.  <br />If you're looking for modern music with the edginess of the backporch of a house overlooking the Pacific in SoCal, this is it.
B0001EKZOQ|5.0|That's pianist Bebo Valdes, one of Cuba's great jam session players of the 1950s (and still a potent force on the music scene) and flamenco vocalist Diego \\"El Cigala,\\" whose half-croaked, Arabic-tinged inflections offer a fine counterpoint to Valdes's trademark sleek, supple piano runs.  Cigala sounds like he, too, must be an ancient old-timer, un viejo, like all those Buena Vista dudes... But in fact he is a youngster, a ponytailed whippersnapper who just happens to channel weight of the the ages... Quite a lot of gravitas, subtlety and artistic firepower is assembled here; just to spice things up, they bring in some highpowered guests, such as jazzman Paquito D'Rivera, Milton Cardona and Brazilian superstar Caetano Veloso, who duets with El Cigala on a version of \\"Coracao Vagabundo,\\" which closes the album.  Also included are classic compositions by Miguel Matamoros, Maria Teresa Vera and other Latin American and Iberian legends.  Mighty classy material.

B000059XUP|1.0|I love the movie The Crow. When I saw it I knew that I had to get it. It was one of the greatest revenge movies ever made. So of course I was very excited to see the second one in my local video store I could not wait to run out and get it. But the second the star opened his mouth I knew that I was in for a bomb.<BR>It is impossible to understand the guy, it sounds like he is talking with food in his mouth, and man was that movie corny. It was the first movie done without any heart. It was incredibly corny and if I could give it a lower rating then one star I would. If this is the only movie in the series that you have seen don't let it stop you from seeing the first one.
B00005LC1H|2.0|I find little humorous about this sitcom. I actually find it all pretty nervewracking and painful to watch.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I am usually an action movie buff or comedy guy, portions of this film really got at me.  This movie was really heartwarming, and I nearly cried as I could relate to one particular story of love pertaining to Juliet (Keira Knightley), Peter, and  his good friend Mark.  A very good movie!  I can guarantee everyone can relate to at least one character and/or their story of love.
B00003RQNJ|5.0|For one when Butch and sundance are being chased up the mountain by the posse Butch mentions Joe LaFors (sp?). I checked a while ago. LaFors really existed as a lawman at the time. But Etta Place (Kathryn Ross)though she really existed was actually not a school teacher. More likely she was a prostitute.
B0002BO0AS|5.0|This album is 10 times better than their previous release &quot;The Stings Of Conscience.&quot; Every fan of metal, whether it is death metal or hardcore should go out and get this. You will not be disappointed.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was curious to watch this show so I rented disk 1. I suddenly got hooked. The actors are great and the stories plus the script are surprisingly brilliant! I wish that the show continued on air but I guess I have to wait until the movie. So now I owned the complete series... Love it!!!
6304696515|5.0|Dangerous Liaisons is a lush and lavish glimpse into the lives of the 18th century French aristocracy.  The Marquise de Merteuil and the Vicomte de Valmont used to be lovers and are now close friends, a powerful but restrained attraction still simmering between them.  They are both twisted people who enjoy manipulating everyone around them, but the foundation of their demise is laid when they make a bet - if Valmont can seduce the virtuous Madame de Tourvel, a married woman of unimpeachable morals, the Marquise will give herself to him for one whole night of romance.  What neither anticipates is that Valmont will fall in love with Tourvel, and that the Marquise will become victim to a destructive jealousy.<br />Glenn Close is marvelous as the depraved Marquise, and ever so subtly reveals to us the insecurities behind the noblewoman's coldly smiling facade.  Malkovich proves that a man does not need to be conventionally handsome in order to be seductive; he exudes serpentine charm and masterfully acts out the Vicomte's slow and astonishing change of heart.  The dialogue is witty and stirring, and the costumes are candy for the eyes.  This was a thoroughly enjoyable film.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|Nice work.  Some of the songs could have used some editing -- the choruses are repeated a few too many times.  But overall, these guys are professionals and the songs generally rock.  My favorites are Rainmaker, Paschendale and Montsegur.  Maiden's best album since Seventh Son.
0156027321|4.0|When i started reading this, i didn't think i could get through it. For me, it was boring!! It was too drawn out, very detailed.<br />But, after the family decided to move, i could not put the book down. The details made me feel like i was in another boat watching him.  I didn't want it to end and, at the end, it made me mad.<br />I definately highly recommend this book.
B0001Z52RU|1.0|There is one thing that Ashton Kutcher has in common with Matt LeBlanc of &quot;Friends&quot;, neither can act outside their TV character. Kutcher is the worst, dramatic acting classes may help. <br />The movie itself is not that bad, however there are a lot of better movies out there dealing with the consequences of time travel such as &quot;Frequency&quot;, &quot;Time Cop&quot; and &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot;.<br />If you like bad Time travel movies try &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; starring Christopher Reeves. It's so bad they come out with a collector's edition.<br />One other note, you have 2 choices of endings, the Director's Cut version which is ludicrous or the almost happy Theatrical version ending. In either case, he goes back in time by watching an old 8mm movie of his Dad's hidden in his Doctor's office which is conveniently threaded and plugged in. Considering it was very rare that 8mm movies even had sound was also convenient.<br />One reviewer noted that this film was for &quot;9-year old boys (and girls) who think Ashton is cool&quot; This is not, in anyway appropriate for children under 17 unless you are as sick as some of the characters in this film.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|This has got to be my favorite movie ever. I am a die-hard fan of The Matrix movies, but this is one hundred times better than the other two. It's phenomenal. It picks up right where 'The Matrix Reloaded' left off. Neo is unconcious in the real world, caught in a mysterious subway station that goes to to the matrix. He has many confrontations with the evil Agent Smith who says the unforgettable line, &quot;I'm not so bad once you get to know me&quot;.  I really like the scene when Neo and Trinity run towards each other in slow motion. But anyway, as the cyberpunk saga comes to a close, you realize that Neo must strike a bargain with the machines and make peace, or both races will be history. This is definitely my favorite movie and I reccomend it.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|She has a decent voice that I don't mind listening to, but her lyrics are just really predictable and simple. Not really that creative. Some are really stupid and childish. &quot;He wouldn't even open up the door&quot; that line to me shows that she needs to take time and perfect her writing or have the Matrix write her songs again. Some of the melodies are pretty good, such as Take Me Away, but you can tell that she is trying hard to get radio airplay. None of it is really impressive to me.
B000059HAI|5.0|After seeing Das Boot for the first time recently, my interest was piqued for another WWII movie. I remember when Tora! was in the theater while I was in high school...and that I had no interest in seeing it at the time. This is a serious-minded, fact-based film of epic proportion. It has similarities to Das Boot in that part of the story is told from the US enemy's point of view. And, oddly enough, I found the structure of the film to be somewhat reminiscent of The Deer Hunter, or even King Solomon's Mines [1950], in that there is a long, detailed build-up of the story prior to any action sequences. And once the action arrived, I sat there thinking, &quot;How did they do this?&quot; Especially considering the fact that this was 1970. But the biggest reward for me is the story itself, and the non-Hollywood way in which it is told here. No one would get financial backing today for a film of this expense coupled with such a non-fiction approach.
B00000DHR0|5.0|A wonderful Christmas album. Unlike those artists that feel &quot;compelled&quot; to put out a token Christmas album, Celine sincerely believes what she's singing about. Highly recommended.
B00020HEL6|5.0|As a hard core swing dancer, I hear more than my fair share of good music but it takes a lot to get me excited. This CD gets me excited. Go to her website and listen to her version of &quot;Summertime&quot; all the way through. Wow.
B00005JL2O|2.0|I won't hesitate a second longer - 'Goldmember' was terrible. The first sequel,' The Spy Who Shagged Me', was bad enough but this really stretches the franchise way too far and over the top. <br />I would have thought that the writers would have come up with some new material but no, its still the same 'Yeeeah Baby' and 'Very Shagadelic' one liners which bring down this films' credibility even more. It's only saving grace are the vast amount of cameos near the beginning, from then on; its trash. The overused 'mole' joke really gets on your nerves after a while and is just another blatant lack of fresh ideas for this third instalment. Even the appearance of Destiny's Child beauty Beyonce Knowles isn't enough to keep you interested. For real comedy, just stick to the first film.
B0001XAODY|5.0|Although my favorite superhero is Batman, I couldn't avoid buying this movie. I can relate to Peter Parker in alot of ways, but I prefer Batman's attitude over Spidey's.<br />The movie teaches a great moral: &quot;With great power comes great responsibility.&quot; Any important person will tell you this. The movie also teaches that, like the old saying, just because you have the power to do something doesn't mean that you should do it.<br />The quality of this DVD is way better than the original DVD. When I first saw Spider-Man on DVD (when it first came out), I noticed some problems with the quality that others have mentioned, such as white speckles appearing at certain times. This DVD fixes those little bugs and improves the picture quality to perfection.<br />If you like Spider-Man, then buy this DVD. It's definitely worth it.
B00023BLXK|4.0|I went to see this movie in the theatre, not expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised! While the plot is fairly predictable, the movie was a nice escape, with decent actors, fantastic music, and the dancing was HOT! I think the movie would stand on its own without the Dirty Dancing title, minus Patrick Swayze's cameo and the short montage of shots reminiscient of the first Dirty Dancing movie. Don't expect an Oscar-worthy performance, but this movie may surprise you.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Wow! This CD was recommended to me by a friend and am I grateful they did.  This Slipknot CD seamlessly transitions full angst-ridden hatred into reflective acoustic masterpieces within the same song. Each song keeps you guessing and coming to a well-deserved and conclusive end.  Buy this album and listen to it all the way through. Money well spent I say. Best rock album so far this year.

B00007BKVC|5.0|Originality is the supreme adjective for this picture. It won deservedly the Academy Award as Original script. Ridley Scott made an authentical road movie but loaded with humor , cynicism , haunting and above all very anti macho movie.<br />The sinister fact that will turn a twist of fate in these two women who only wanted to have fun just for a while will become in a permanent and menacing nightmare for both of them .<br />The spectacular landscapes are a huge background all the way reminds us Paris Texas . The use of big lenses and the arresting images walks together with a solid script .<br />Brad Pitt appears briefly as the hitch hike guy who eventually seduces Thelma . Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis are the mirror images of Sundance Kid , you may consider it a speculation, but think it carefully . Since the accidental murder , and the sweet smell of the risk when Geena robes a supermarket , the dramatic car chase is very close in spirit to the sudamerican getaway and above all the ending sequence .<br />Keitel works efficiently , once more and Scott shows us once more why he's on the top direction .<br />Consider this one from its release as one of the most powerful nineties cult movies!
B000148KK2|1.0|Okay, this is what I get from this. It is not really bad stuff, but it's not great, either. It is sort of like a bit of Julie London and Peggy Lee with some Bill Evans style piano playing thrown in, then watered down to make it easier to digest for the pop audience. Not as terrible as some have said... but nothing I care to play more than one time. It's pretty bland for jazz in my book. The Costello-Krall songs are not well written and don't go anywhere, either.
B00009V7P8|5.0|This is my first review of anything on Amazon, though I am a constant reader. I simply had to talk about this album.<br />The best way to describe this album is fearless. He takes the road less traveled by other up-and-coming singer-songwriters. While the new batch has had some very good singers, nothing compares to this album. They seem more interested in making a &quot;clean&quot; album, while this album seems like he is alone in a room baring his soul.<br />Though the strange thing is about the album s that you know he could not have been alone in a room. There is so much going on, so many chances taken that it is hard to descibe. Simply saying that it is an acoustic album is wrong. The album brings in much more. <br />Fearless in his atempts to expand beyond just him and his guitar. Consider how at the end of Amie, out of nowhere comes what sounds like an entire orchestra. It sounds beautiful and it becomes almost impossible to imagine the song without it. Then the gorgarian (sp?) chants that enter into Cold Water. By the end of the album it seems only appropriate to have an opera singer at the end of Eskimo. <br />But the wonderful things about the album is that it doesn't rely on these tricks. They are simply used to enchance the songs. Cannonball is simply him and his guitar, and it is one of the best songs on the album (a song friends of mine have confessed crying to when they heard it).<br />Another huge difference between him and others is the feeling involved. I have yet to hear another singer coming out now who you can feel their pain so clearly and identify with it(Howie Day is close). The only line in the chorus of The Blower's Daughter is &quot;I can't take my eyes off you...&quot; The way he sings it and the passion in his voice make the line more romantic and meaningful than an entire boy-band album.<br />Just the other night I went outside with my CD Player to sit on the front porch and listen to music while I smoked a cigarette. I started at trackone, and became so engrossed in the songs, I just sat there until the album finished. It is THAT good. And it is that feeling that is put into every song that gives me the impression this album will age very well. <br />I agree with others that he brings back memories of when Jeff Buckley was around. They invoke the same spirit. And that is nothing but a compliment, because if there is anything music needs now, it is someone who can do to people what Jeff did. Even though Jeff died too soon, people are still listening to his music because it means so much to them. I have the feeling that this album will do the same. It is Damien Rice's &quot;Grace&quot;.<br />My only concern is the same as others. How in the hell is he going to follow this up? But here is the fun part, imagine if he somehow makes a better album?
6304007523|5.0|All of us love to pull for the underdog, especially if the dog's odds are seemingly insurmountable.  Of all the thrilling, inspiring, &quot;feel good&quot; underdog movies out there, ROCKY rates as one of the best.  The movie that put Sylvester Stallone on the celebrity map (unfortunately), ROCKY still entertains some three decades after its initial, Academy Award-winning run.<br />We all know the story:  Rocky Balboa, an undisciplined club brawler and strong-arm collection man from the slums of Philadelphia, gets a once-in-a-lifetime shot at boxing's heavyweight title.  Yet the upcoming fight is merely the trimming surrounding the story; ROCKY is about a humble man with a heart of gold--a man who confronts his shortcomings and insecurities to evolve into a remarkable human being.  To assist him on his journey, Rocky develops a timid relationship with an equally insecure girl, a pet shop worker named Adrian (played wonderfully by Talia Shire).  To see the two of them together on their first date is one of the film's most entertaining, bittersweet moments; Rocky's small talk is hilarious yet mundane--Adrian looks terrified, yet finally begins to relax, to come out of her shell.  Once two lost souls, Rocky and Adrian become indispensable to one another; their growing love transcends the pending fight--the exciting showdown.<br />The fight itself is cinematic brilliance:  a thrilling, totally believable match that will have the viewer cheering from his chair.  Carl Weathers looks, moves, talks, and fights like an egotistical heavyweight champ, while Burgess Meredith captures one of film's most memorable roles as Mickey, Rocky's gnarled, battle-tested trainer.  Few movies universally touch a collective nerve that has the viewer spontaneously smiling while wiping a tear from the eye.  ROCKY is one of them.<br />--D. Mikels
B00009V7OR|5.0|I absolutely love this movie because it's so much action packed fun where vicious aliens from outer space unleash destruction upon the earth's human population and now they must fight back and destroy the aliens before they destroy humanity. This is just so much fun. The special effects are top notch and the acting is great! I really loved the way the spaceships looked like as opposed to looking like flying dinner plates. Go and buy this movie 2day!
B0002234LS|4.0|Great movie if you havn't seen Fight Club before. Otherwise you'll know how it ends by the time Johnny Depps house burns down and he says &quot;So that does work.&quot; I love david Koepp and Stephin King but not really original but entertaining.
B00005JMUA|3.0|This movie is really good but it is not as good as the first one. It's much slower and I found the ending a little dissapointing. <br />The high points were getting to know Pai Mei, The Bride's old Kung Fu Master and the fight scene with Elle Driver(Daryl Hannah), the only real fight scene in the movie. And it was good to see David Carradine after all these years, his character was very interesting.<br />This movie it's a must own for all fans of Kill Bill Vol.1 because it give us a greater understanding of why the events on Vol.1 took place, both movies complement each other very well. But if for some reason you did not liked Vol. 1 don't try this one, it's not so enjoyable on it's own.

0140288503|5.0|Mark Bowden has done an outstanding job of telling the story of the battle of Mogadishu.  U.S. army rangers and delta forces were in Mogadishu trying to kill or capture Mohamed Farrah Aidid, a local warlord, leader of the Habr Gidr clan, who was preventing international relief agencies from properly distributing food in famine-decimated Somalia.<br />Trying to pluck one well-hidden person from the midst of a very sympathetic populace is not so easy, as we learned then and have re-learned in the case of Ossama bin Ladin.  The U.S. began to settle for picking off top Aidid aids.<br />This battle bagan when U.S. forces learned that two Aidid lieutenants were meeting in a building near the center of the Aidid-controlled section of Mogadishu.  The plan called for Delta forces to take the building and capture the men, for army rangers to secure the corners of the block containing the target building, and for black Hawk helicopters to provide overhead cover for the rangers.<br />It was a reasonably good plan, but it had one very serious weakness.  It turned out that the Black Hawks were very vulnerable to fire from rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), a cheap and reliable Soviet made weapons system.  RPGs are as common as dirt in third world countries, and Aidid's forces had plenty of them.  Two of the Black Hawks were shot down by RPG fire, and two more were damaged so badly that they had to crash land back at the U.S. base.  In trying to retrieve the downed Black Hawk pilots and crews (or their bodies), the rangers and Delta forces got shot to hell by an extremely hostile city full of AK-47-toting Somalis.<br />It is an amazing story, well told by Mark Bowden.  Part of the irony and horror of the situation is that we were only trying to help, we were only trying to do good.  Yet we ended up getting 19 of our own boys killed and 70 others wounded, and killing perhaps (no one knows for sure) 500 Somalis.  The moral to the story is that if you're trying to do good, send missionaries.  The army is not a missionary force.  The purpose of the army is to kill people, and it should never be deployed unless U.S. national security is implicated, which it was not in Somalia.missionaries.  The army is not a missionary force.  The purpose of the army is to kill people, and it should never be deployed unless U.S. national security is implicated, which it was not in Somalia.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|Wow, I really didn't expect this DVD so great. I mean, I'm not a huge RHCP fan, just a casual listener. But, in terms of general rock live recording, this DVD blew my mind. First, their performance is so perfect and energetic. Especially, I like rather unconventional song selection of this live, because many of the songs show other sides of RHCP, master of not only funky rock but soft, deliberate ballads. Second, camera work and its quality is what I've never seen. The director seems to know what they're playing and adjust video to the music in a real organic way. See what editor did when flea is jumping around. Third, the Irish audiences are the part of this live, inseparable unit. I like the scene where they're singing soccer anthem all together. Even RHCP has to listen to it! In all, this DVD is one of the best live DVDs I've ever seen. Before this, I watched Pearl Jam's Madison Square Garden live DVD, but it is a real crap compared to this. Pearl Jam was really boring, song after song...and the picture quality was bad.
0441003257|5.0|I was house-sitting for a buddy of mine in the Navy and came across this book - only I thought it went by a different title (&quot;The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch&quot;). Lo and behold, almost a decade later, that I read &quot;American Gods&quot;, dug it, and looked into what else Neil Gaiman has written. I saw the blurb for &quot;Good Omens&quot;, thought it would a quick fun read only to discover, gasp, I had found it. <br />I thought the book was hilarious and brilliant the 1st time around, and my perception of it has not changed. Terry Pratchett has a wonderfully twisted mind and incredible wit. The pop references are so well-handled (isn't so strue about all cassettes turning into Queen?), and the characters are so vibrant.<br />Do not pass up this book. Your very soul may depend on it - or you could get served a hamburger by the &quot;King&quot;, go wild!
B00012FXB8|5.0|After reading the enormous amount of negativity at this third entry in the Alien series, I feel highly compelled to step in here and defend this marvelous 1992 sequel to the 1986 predecessor \\"Aliens\\" entitled simply \\"Alien 3\\" and as I write this, I have to say that while this movie definitely has some troubling flaws, this is a very strong and amazing movie and one of my favorite science-fiction movies of all time.<br /><br />Ellen Ripley, who is now in cryogenic suspension on board the spaceship that she got on to escape the colonized planet after saving Newt from the alien that hitched a ride on board. Unaware of it though, the alien that she defeated was in fact a queen that laid a small egg in a hidden compartment onboard the ship. The alien that hatched onboard which happened to be a `facehugger' on board causes an acid spill which causes an electrical fire and the resulting fire causes the escape pod where the survivors of the previous movie to be separated from the mother ship. After crashing into the ocean on a desolate planet, Ripley finds herself once again the only survivor on a totally unknown world. After being revived in a high-security prison called Fury 161, Ripley finds herself being the only woman in a prison with a religious cult comprised of convicted criminals like former rapists and murderers. Now being imprisoned on the planet, she learns her greatest nightmare of all and how much of a big sacrifice must be made in order to destroy the aliens once and for all. However, Ripley has no idea that the alien isn't her only enemy anymore.<br /><br />The acting once again is top-notch. Sigourney Weaver once again scores another touchdown as the ever awesome heroine Ellen Ripley as she did in the previous two Alien movies. This time Ripley's journey is a lot more personal than ever before and Weaver perfectly brings out the emotional turmoil of Ripley. Charles Dutton brilliantly plays former murderer Dillon who leads a religious cult and makes a really action-packed fight against the alien creature in the climax of the film. I also really like British actor Charles Dance's role as the troubled character Clemens and seeing how he got to where he was as a doctor at the prison facility.<br /><br />The movie feels so much different from the previous two movies. I almost view this as almost like a return to the utter suspense of the first Alien movie and away from the tons of action that dominated the second entry in this series. The colors too are a lot more `orange' where as I often view the others having a more `greenish' look to them. This also has a much more of a Gothic industrial tone to it than the previous ones. The alien creature was also a lot different than in \\"Aliens\\" and that it was born from a dog (on the theatrical version) and runs on four legs and is much faster.<br /><br />While this is a great movie, this tends to suffer from some problems which likely has caused a lot of fans of the previous two to really shun this movie. While I can't blame them for killing off two important characters from the previous movie, my biggest problems are different. The greatest flaw with this movie is not it's storyline nor the deaths of Newt and Hicks but it's excessive used of dropping F-Bombs right and left. Swearing doesn't bother me necessarily but the F-Bomb is WAY overused here and it really tends to detract from the films enjoyability. I also wasn't too thrilled at the whole prospect of the prisoners being nothing more than just `live bait' for the alien to kill off one by one. However at the same time it was pretty interesting using the `no weapons' idea since the prison does not allow any weapons on it's premises.<br /><br />The \\"Collector's Edition\\" is fantastic in many ways. The deeply flawed theatrical release is much better in its remastered form but the \\"Special Edition\\" is light years ahead of its old theatrical counterpart. With the film being extended to two hours and thirty-five minutes, with someold footage replaced with previously unreleased footage, along with extended and previously unreleased scenes, \\"The Special Edition\\" of \\"Alien 3\\" really helps to mend a lot of the problems that plagued the original version and the result is a movie that is almost as great as the first two movies. It's darkly poetic, dramatic, intense and sheds new light on Ripley's fate and provides greater insight into the character Clemens. The only problem I had was the ending which where the climax scene had new CGI effects and the result in all honesty looked a lot more fake than it did in the original version. Despite this minor quibble, the \\"Special Edition\\" of this movie is light years better than the original and the result is a flawed movie that really is lifted much higher in rankings to rank up there with the 1979 original. It'll never top \\"Aliens\\" for me but \\"Alien 3\\" really benefits from it's revamping. To all of the people who strongly detested this movie to begin with, I would strongly recommend that if you have the time, watch the \\"Special Edition\\" because it really helps to correct a lot of the mistakes of the original and it makes the characters a lot more three-dimensional. I have come to appreciate this movie a lot more since seeing it on its newest form.<br /><br />The second disc is a real treat. The extras on disc two are really good and along with the first disc, warrant purchasing \\"Alien 3\\". I at first found that this was a movie that was not easy to digest especially due to its troubling loss of two of the main characters from the previous movie \\"Aliens\\" from 1986. However I have since over time have come to really enjoy this movie and have felt more sorry for the crew after seeing a deep insight into how troubled the movies making really was. You can also see the mixed reactions towards the finished film from the crew members who were involved in it's production. Perhaps the most memorable thing I learned even if it's not from the DVD itself was how much agony David Fincher went through when directing this movie. He was pushed into this movie's directing late into it's production and the result was enormous tension between him and other producers which resulted in agonizing almost non-stop work in directing this movie. Upon this I felt sorry for him that he had to go through all of this and that he was pushed into this late into it's production and how interference from Fox Studios really made things go awry for him. Perhaps it's why he hasn't embraced it since its release nor has he done a commentary on it but I have to credit him that his work on this is nonetheless absolutely fantastic and the result was worth it to me. The second disc also has a really spectacular time lapse shot of the crew building the movie set over a period of months. It's really a lot of fun to watch, seeing the studio ground going from looking like a concert stage being set up to nearing completion. There are even more where that came from too on this DVD.<br /><br /> To me while it isn't the best of the series by any means, \\"Alien 3\\" is a really excellent and satisfying conclusion to the storyline of Ellen Ripley and her war against the predatory alien creatures. To me, \\"Alien 3\\" makes a great conclusion to the Alien movie storyline. To me, this is the true conclusion to Aliens at the same time, I often think of 1997's \\"Alien Resurrection\\" as more like some wacky spin-off of some sort and a cash-in on the saga that had almost nothing to do with the previous three movies and I agree. While I'm not saying that it was terrible, it wouldn't have been a bad idea of they had simply closed the series on the third one.<br /><br /> I give the makers of this newest DVD two flaming thumbs up for doing such a great job at giving this misunderstood classic a second chance on DVD. The movie itself is a great film but the newest edition on this marvelous two-disc set makes this movie so much better than it was ever before. I strongly recommend that forthose who enjoyed this film that you go and buy this DVD today.

B000063UR1|2.0|I must say I actually applauded Douglas Trumball for making this film, and upon it's release, it made an impact with audiences, but I never cared for it as entertainment or as serious science fiction. Today, the short-lived &quot;ecology movement&quot;, green flags and all, is long gone, and this film is now is a seriously dated curio of it's time. <br />There are some terrific things to be said about this film... and there are some intelligent reviews of it that I agree with... however there are some fatal touches that make this a dated piece, and that make it difficult to watch today.<br />First of all, Bruce Dern's unappealing character is a stereotypical &quot;hippie&quot;. He is a classic &quot;passive-agressive&quot; person... at one moment &quot;loving and peaceful&quot; and the next minute he is angry, pissed off, not in control of his emotions. He is certainly difficult for me to empathize with, since he reminds me of many &quot;do-gooders&quot; I have known who are unpredictable and untrustworthy and have a &quot;hidden agenda&quot; besides &quot;peace and love&quot;. Dern plays this part to perfection, but its not something comfortable to watch for 2 hours. I have seen this film 2 or 3 times and each time I just wanted a chance to stuff something in his mouth to shut him up.<br />Secondly, the soundtrack of Joan Baez singing her folk tunes in space is just too limited for the scope of the visuals and destroys the impact of the powerful message the film tries to convey about &quot;saving the planet&quot;. Her passive, slightly off-key and limited-ranged vocals do not marry well to the scenes of space, stars, planets and infinity. It does not work on any level... either then or now.<br />Finally, the most fatal flaw of this film is that as the plants begin to die... our hero panics and says he has no clue why. Forgetting about the space ship leaving the solar system and the gigantic glass domes leaving solar rays, he suddenly &quot;realizes&quot; that plants need SUN. What kind of ecological genius is this guy? <br />Well, the robots are clever and cute, the sets are impressive, the early scenes with the &quot;friendly&quot; plants are nice and the special effects are first rate for their day.... and we get to see Saturn's rings in the movies for the first time looking relatively authentic. It's certainly not as bad as a few reviewers have said, and sci-fi fans should see it, but there are far better sci-fi films out there.... and better ones that deal with the rape of our ecosystem.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|If ever there was a modern tragedy comparable to that of poor Macbeth, it is surely that of feckless, clueless Robert McNamara, the former Secretary of Defense under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, a man widely acknowledged to be the principal architect of the American strategy in Vietnam, the original author of policies such as body counts, a math whiz who saw the world in terms of sophisticated and elegant mathematical models. Unfortunately for McNamara and the 58,000 American boys who died in the rotting jungles of that fetid wasteland, the models failed in the real world of revolutionary zeal and little Asian guys in black pajamas, rubber flip-flops and with scruffy haircuts, who apparently never studied such methods in cutting-edge calculus and so were inexorably immune to such weighty prognostications.<br />It is bizarre, to say the least, then, to view this rambling monologue of twisting and winding excuses that the frail but still drop-dead intellectually gifted McNamara uses as he so frantically attempts to stamp his own brand of revisionist reinterpretations on the history of the Vietnam era and his own participation in it. Like the ghost of Iago, then, McNamara emerges from his own self-imposed splendid isolation of the last thirty years to set us all straight on what really happened back when bombs were flying and kids were dying. As the facts clearly show, he continued to support the prosecution of the war long after he knew it was a lost cause.<br />Certainly this is spellbinding stuff, yet anyone who is as well informed regarding the particulars McNamara slips through so effortlessly understands he is often playing fast and loose with the historical facts, and that he ignores many pieces of evidence which contradict his take on the way things unraveled. Indeed, what it appears to reduce to in the end is a brilliant but haunted man still attempting to justify, by virtue of his own considerable charm, intellect, and self-serving guile, and through painting an inaccurate and one-sided portrait of the zeitgeist of the post WWII era, his own role in the single most disastrous American war (at least until Iraq). This is an extended interview and documentary you will not want to miss. Enjoy!nting an inaccurate and one-sided portrait of the zeitgeist of the post WWII era, his own role in the single most disastrous American war (at least until Iraq).

B000002C25|3.0|There's been a stalinist re-write of history on this CD. <br />'The Greatest Thing Ever' on it's release soon evolved into 'A Misguided Overblown Epic'. Not surprinsingly, it fits pretty neatly between the two. The dross on here is simply pedestrian; nothing on here will make you want to throw the disk away. The songs are too long ('Magic Pie' and 'Do you know what i mean?' outstay their welcomes after the 8th guitar refrain!!!) and the constantly huge guitars do seem to hide some pretty weak songs. <br />'Stand By Me' is wonderous and 'All around the world' and 'Girl in the dirty shirt' are defiantly celebratory. Though they come off as boorish morans in the tabloid press, the talent within their ranks shines through.  And Noel has the best handle on fame that I've ever seen.
0783228457|5.0|David Cronenberg is one of the greatest horror film directors to come on the scene. His stylish mix of science fiction and horror gives us surreal films easily compared to directors like David Lynch amoung others. Videodrome is probably my favorite Cronenberg film.<br />The film is about a television station that specializes in showing softcore pornography and other disturbing types of film. Max Renn, played wonderfully by James Woods, has people go out and find new footage for the network to play. In his search, Renn comes across a video entitled Videodrome, which contains footage of a brutal torture of a few woman. The video becomes an obsession of Renn's and begins to control his life.<br />An incredible film, with amazing performances from Debrah Harry, singer for the band Blondie, and Woods. The film gives a surreal look at how what we see on television can control our lives. I recommend it to anyone who loves Sci-Fi or horror movies. Definately a classic.
B00008PC2O|5.0|We are all too familiar with the story of this movie, so I will spare you the details. &quot;The Terminator&quot; was a sleeper sci-fi hit that was a rarity in its genre. Movie-goers were beginning to see sci-fi films that rose above others in the genre and even other genres. &quot;Alien&quot;, &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and, the film that started the revolution, &quot;2001: A Space Odyessy&quot;. What made &quot;Terminator&quot; so different was not just another bleak view of the future, but a tense, edgy thriller with some damn fine writing. But while it took an effort to make films like those, it took a greater one to make a sequel. &quot;Aliens&quot;, &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, and very few others accomplished this task successfully. As for &quot;T2&quot;, unless you've been living under a rock, we all know how well it did. This is definitely the best of the series (in my opinion at least) and definitely one of the best action movies to grace the face of our planet. This is the movie that also started the trend of making action movies with ridiculously huge budgets and paying action stars ridiculously huge salaries. But T2 delivers, with a great story, stunning visuals, and Schwarzenegger in his prime. Plus who can forget Brad Fiedel's synthetic score which has been parodied numerous times?<BR>Why another DVD though? This film has been put on DVD almost as many times as &quot;Independence Day&quot;. Special features are somewhat reserved here, so what justifies another release? DVD producer Van Ling answers the question in a quaint little insert about how new technology has developed since the last T2 transfer. They can now present T2 the way it should be, digitally mastered from a 1080p, 24sf digital telecline transfer for &quot;superior video and audio quality&quot;. This release of T2 is aimed toward the home theater crowd. All that confusing talk means that the picture is presented with more clarity. <BR>And the sound is justawesome. The DTS track has been dropped from the &quot;Ultimate Edition&quot; in exchange for a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround EX track and a Dolby headphone track. If you have the technology, try to watch a DVD with a DTS track whenever possible. In the case of this DVD, there's only the Dolby 5.1 EX track. But the track on this &quot;Extreme DVD&quot; defies both the Dolby and DTS tracks from the &quot;Ultimate Edition&quot;. It takes full advantage of a dimensional sound field.<BR>The goodies here are minimal; a SFX documentary, a behind the scenes montage, and a few DVD-ROM goodies that I didn't bother to try. But there is the original version of the film available to Windows Media Player 9 users on the second disc. You can watch it on the first disc as well, it's disguised as an easter egg. On the main menu of Disc 1, hit the right button five times while highlighting &quot;Play Extended Version&quot;. There's also an enhanced mode with behind the scnes and there's a spankin new commentary by James Cameron himself.<BR>But the question remains; is this DVD worth buying? It really boils down to what your reasons are for buying this new DVD. If you don't own the film, yes. If you're troubled by the mediocre video quality of either of the first two releases, then yes. If you want Cameron's commentary and other new supplements, yes. And if you want to playback T2 in HD on your PC (and even if you find that your computer equipment is currently insufficient for HD playback), yes. But if you want extensive behind the scenes, you might want to stick with your &quot;Ultimate Edition&quot;. This &quot;Extreme Edition&quot; delivers though, despite falling short in the behind the scenes section.
B00003CWPL|5.0|In 1977, a director named David Lynch was making a name for himself with the greatly disturbing and sureal masterpiece Eraserhead. The disturbing images and creepy worlds Lynch creates are like nothing else in film. <br />The film is about Henry Spencer, played by Jack Nance (R.I.P.). Henry is a lonely man who lives in an industrial nightmare. He lives in an apartment with flickering lights and drawers filled with bowls of water. Henry has to visit his girlfriend Mary's parents house. He agrees. <br />After getting to know Mary's strange family, he discovers that Mary is pregnant with his child. However, when the baby is born, it doesn't look like a baby. It's a mutant. Still, Henry and Mary decide to take care of the baby, until Mary decides to leave when she can't stand the baby anymore. Henry is left with the disformed child, who eventually grows sick. After this, Heny's whole life becomes a living hell.<br />Lynch's strange debut is one of the weirdest and most obscure films to be released. It's black and white grainy look gives the film it's disturbing feel. The more the film goes on, the more it grows on you. You just want to continue watching. However, this is not a film for everyone. This images of the mutant baby could be one of the greatest nightmares for first time parents, and the film's message of \\"In Heaven everything is fine\\" could be a drop for deeply depressed film fans. <br />In conclusion, Eraserhead is a classic Sci-Fi/Horror masterpiece. it gives a look into someone's nightmare and a life turning into complete insanity. Not for the weak, David Lynch's great debut is a must see for fans of obscure and strange films. Hard to find, but worth the money. SEE IT!
0140177396|5.0|Of Mice And Men Is a well written book, that you can enjoy with the whole family. In the story two friends who seem to be family protect each other through their whole journy.

B00005V9HA|5.0|One of my all time favorite horror movies next to day of the dead, Zombie, dead alive, etc. A good horror for fans of the undead or just a quick scare. There are some very gruesome scenes such as decapitation by shovel, eyeballs exploding, attacking intestines, and it seems when ever you see the Deans daughter, about five or ten minutes later she's naked. I also highly recommend Bride of the Re-Animator.

0452282152|5.0|I inhaled this book when it reached my hands. I was not very familiar with Vermeer's paintings at the time, but I really enjoyed learning the stories behind the paintings, whether or not they actually happened. The author really did her homework on the painter as well as Dutch customs in the 1600's as far as I could verify it, although I am no expert. I watched the movie, however, and it fell short of my expectations. I know it's hard for a movie to be 100% true to the original story but it may just be that I am a perfectionist. If you saw the movie and liked it, then you'll definitely enjoy this book. Even if you didn't, it's still worth a shot.

0140042520|5.0|I first met Kerouac in the early 70s, when I was finishing my sentence in college. He inspired me to actually go on the road and hitch hike across the country several times (something I would no longer recommend). I learned about America through Jack. Dharma Bums taught me that there was another side to thought and life than the ones I had been living. While he himself was self destructive, I have incorporated many of his philosophies thorughout my lfe, and continue to search for truth and beauty, even while amid lies and ugliness. Trying to explain Dharma Bums and its philosophies to my teenage daughter is a trip. She just looks at me as though I'd lost my mind, which I no doubt did years ago when I first ran in to the stories of Kerouac. It's sad to think that the ideas and lifestyles he enshrines are dying out, if not dead all ready. Anyone looking for a boost into the beat world, or an explanation for what made it so &quot;in&quot; 50 years ago would best be advised to read Dharma Bums, and On The Road. Nuff said.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin DeGraw is completely talented.  There's no doubt about it.  But alot of times I find myself wondering why many artists can't perform that well live.  This is one artist that did not leave me scratching my head.  He is amazing live, and for some reason that makes me respect his music even more.  I think that his live performances are better the his recorded sounds.  So if you want something a little more intimate, packed with talent, and Gavin alone with his magical fingers on ivory keys, I suggest you check out his new album, Chariot Stripped.  It has all the same songs as the album Chariot and it's just as awesome.
1400032717|5.0|This is a fascinating, quick read that offers insight into the mind of an autistic adolescent. It's well-written, engaging, and tugs at the heart strings occasionally. Autism is a very real problem that has limited exposure in our society, as 'Rain Man' has been the somewhat comical stereotype.  Mark Haddon has offered his perspective in a true, credible form. The somewhat dark entertainment of the book is accurately compared to that of Catcher in the Rye. I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about this perplexing disorder for which there is still no 'cure'.

B000065VA1|5.0|Peter Gabriel capped his troika of five star albums with what became his commercial high-point, the energetic (for him, anyway) &quot;So.&quot; I guess when you say energetic in regard to Gabriel, that definition comes from the hits &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; and &quot;Big Time.&quot; The hard hitting rhythms and memorable videos from those two songs made them huge hits and -- peculiar enough -- dance floor sensations. The hook in &quot;Big Time&quot; is so mammoth that it has since been used to do everything from promote movies to selling automobiles; ironic, considering the song's focus on falsity of the commercial world.<br />For those who viewed this sudden burst of commercial acceptance as sell out, &quot;So&quot; has something they obviously missed. This is Gabriel's most spiritual album. &quot;Mercy Street,&quot; &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; and &quot;Don't Give Up&quot; are unbelievably uplifting songs. Having explored African music for the basis of much of &quot;Security,&quot; this time Gabriel enlisted one of that continent's foremost vocalists. The exuberance of Youssou N'Dour at the close of &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; and the angelic (I can't think of any other way to describe it) lead of Kate Bush on &quot;Don't Give Up&quot; make both of these the kind of songs I turn to in moments of despair.<br />In addition to N'Dour and Bush, &quot;So&quot; has an amazing list of player's players contributing. Everyone from Jim Kerr of Simple Minds, Michael Been of The Call, Nile Rogers of Chic, and producer Daniel Lanois all contribute to making &quot;So&quot; a stunning album of rich musical tones. In fact, this may be the Peter Gabriel album that benefited the most from its remastering. Lanois' production tends to lean on more organic sounds, and this new edition of &quot;So&quot; finds them sounding more crisp and spaced.<br />The remastering did leave me with one gripe. How come &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; got pushed to the end of this CD as opposed to the track five slot of the original? (This CD's participants' track listing didn't change the guest musicians/running order, either!) On original discs, &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; came between &quot;That Voice Again&quot; and &quot;Mercy Street,&quot; leaving the album to end with the more peculiar (and more satisfying) &quot;This Is The Picture/Excellent Birds.&quot;<br />That's just a minor question in perspective to the overall impact of &quot;So.&quot; This was one of the Top 5 albums of 1986, and along with albums by Bruce Springsteen, U2 and Simple Minds, one of the best of the eighties as a decade.ot of the original?

B0001UL7RY|3.0|Move over, Usher, Lil John and Ludacris - Avril's got more &quot;Yeah&quot;'s than you can handle! But for Avril, they're more of an awkward filler/lyric replacement. Under My Skin is an album with a more grown-up sound but even more childish and simplistic lyrics than Avril's first release, Let Go. She seems to go out of her way to use words with as few syllables as possible, or to fit bigger words into a meter that stresses the wrong syllable. Avril's voice sounds great on some of the songs - in fact, I think she has a lot of vocal potential. On some tracks she sounds a bit like the lead singer of the Cranberries. It's almost too bad she chose the choppy, semi-schizophrenic type of music that she performs. (Oh, and I sure hope she has improved her live performances.) Almost every song has her sing-screaming high pitched lyrics or filler sounds - who knew Avril was a soprano? She gives the occasional word a british accent. Strange. It's a good thing that the melodies of the songs are pretty creative on this CD, because the lyrics could NOT stand alone.<br />The only truly intriguing song on the CD, in my opinion, is number 5, &quot;Different From Me.&quot; On this track, her oh-oh's actually add a lot to the song, and the tone is very thoughtful. Track 6, &quot;Happy Ending,&quot; is really catchy, and probably destined to be a single. Track 8, &quot;Forgotten,&quot; has the most annoying placement of &quot;Yeah-ee-yeah,&quot; but it's also the most addictive song on the CD. I'll definitely be listening to it more. <br />Avril's first go-round, Let Go, is definitely a superior record. This one gets 3 out of 5 stars from me, mainly because of the lyrics! However, I think an Avril fan could come to like each song on the CD.
B0000636UN|2.0|This is easily my least favorite Sheryl Crow album. &quot;Tuesday Night Music Club&quot; featured a slew of catchy hits that, though sang imperfectly, had a charm and a lot of emotion. &quot;Sheryl Crow&quot; and &quot;The Globe Sessions&quot; followed, and we learned that Sheryl has quite an impressive vocal range, and isn't afraid to play around with different styles of music. Her lyrical ability became more apparent in the process as well. While these second two albums were risky in all the right ways &quot;C'mon C'mon&quot; is predictable and boring. Nearly all the songs have a radio-friendly southern rock sheen, and there are FAR too many guest vocalists (Gwyneth? why?). I didn't want a Sheryl and Friends album. This is not to say that the album has nothing to offer. The innocuous &quot;Steve McQueen&quot; is catchy and decent. &quot;Safe and Sound&quot; sounds like Sheryl has channeled Tori Amos for a moment in time. &quot;Diamond Road&quot; sounds like something from the Beatle's &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; days (can't go wrong there).  For someone new to Sheryl's work, I suggest purchasing any other of her albums...for those that just want to her the same formula about 10 times, this might work for you.
B000002LQR|5.0|I have to say, I have a collection of over 600 CD's - and this would be in my top 3 of the all time greatest albums ive ever had the pleasure of listening to. Hardly ever do I &quot;wear out&quot; a CD - this one would have to be an exception. It was pure genious when it came out, and still is today. I think I can honestly say the Red Hot Chilli Peppers have to be one of the greatest collections of the most talented musicians to ever come together. Many people focus on Flea's outrageous and funked up bass playing, but the fact is Chad Smith is an amazing drummer, and John Fruisciante - is near godlike to anyone who knows anything about playing Guitar. If you are younger and want to know what the REAL chilli peppers are like - get this album!!

0440214041|3.0|the illustations by Dr. Suess were excellent, but there just weren't enough pelicans for what was promised.<br /><br /> When I read a book entitled &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot;, I want a gripping legal drama about wetland preserves and the natural habitats of &lt;font face=\\"Times\\" size=\\"7\\">&lt;b>pelicans&lt;/b>&lt;/font>.
B000002A46|5.0|I must admit I liked this CD very much. I even played it after christmas. The Asian Version has 11 tracks. The bonus track is God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen. A very nice vocally performed song. Vocally done very nicely with the layering of vocals and is not boring to listen to. In fact most of this album is in her gospel singing. I just love it.
B0001DI0FI|1.0|Sorry fellas I gotta keep it real. This film is so incredibly boring it almost put me to sleep.(Like a sweet rocka bye-baby melody)Theres like zero action and like 2 scene changes, the ship and the little rock island. The one battle scene is a joke too. This is just a horrible attempt. I even had a hard time understanding the dialog.  My mistake is that I bought it before I watched it, I wanted to like this movie so bad and I had high expectations for it. Thank God I was able to unload my copy for 6 bucks, I just wish I could have the time I wasted watching it back. I'd give it a quarter of a star if I could. Horrible! Too much talking and playing violins (Hee Haw !!!) This one sucks bad...Real Bad!!
B0000TB01Y|4.0|Wicked, in my opinion, is a very fun musical. The songs are enjoyable and catchy, and Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth (as Elphaba and Glinda) are truely a unique pair.<BR>The one issue I have with this musical is the lyrics. Sometimes, they are so horrid (or cheesy, at least), that you marvel that Stephen Schwartz couldn't think of anything better.<BR>(Then again, I am not a fan of Stephen Schwartz's material: I hightly dislike Godspell.)<BR>All in all, however, Wicked is an enjoyable musical, and it's even better if you have the oppertunity of seeing it performed on Broadway (although, if you plan on seeing it, I recommend listening to the album after seeing the show).
B0001US8EO|3.0|No doubt this movie is a western classic. I saw it years ago and loved it. I don't have anything negative to say about the movie itself. I almost picked up this 2 disc set until I learned it's a cut down or edited version. Why is the complete 212 min version only available on VHS ? That's just stupid. This is a great movie worthy of a director's cut edition maybe 3 disc set? I'd spend the extra cash on a deeper edition, until then I'll save my money. Please, please release the FULL version on DVD!

0156027321|5.0|Yann Martel is pretty awesome.  With this one book, he made me questions so much about life, existence, and God.  In the beginning of the book, one of the characters states that this story will make you believe in God.  I can't say that it did that for me, but it did show me why God is \\"the better story\\".  The book is actually two stories in one.  <br />It starts with the life of Pi Patel, an Indian boy growing up around a zoo in India while practicing Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity all at one time.  From there, the story takes you on a breathtaking adventure which can be inspiring and horrifying all at one time.  The majority of the book is Pi recounting his tale of how he survived 227 days on a lifeboat with little supplies and a royal Bengal tiger.  In the end, when the officials don't want to believe his story, Pi tells another one.  A more believable yet still horrific story filled with \\"dry, yeastless factuality\\".  In the end, which story one chooses to believe is up to each individual person.  <br />If you read nothing else, at least pick up the book and read the very short chapter 22.  It is the true essence of the story.  This is an amazing book.  It's perfect for a book club and for discussing with others.  There are many aspects of the book that can be interpreted in different ways and I am sure it is insightful to hear each person's take on it.  I highly recommend it to anyone.
0790729628|1.0|Compared to the original version the Director's Cut is awful.  Background narration has been removed; the ending has been changed.  Don't waste your money.
B00005JMUA|5.0|(...)  I will agree that there is less action and blood in this movie but that is for a good REASON, which the boneheads don't seem to understand.  I have seen this movie 6 times in theaters and have grown to love it more with each viewing.  (By the way, the theater was full every time even after the movie being out for two-plus months.)  There is so much more here - this isn't a \\"grind house\\" movie like the first.  There is more dialog and more drama.  Once again, the stupid factor in the American public is now reviewing movies and if someone's head doesn't get cut off the movie is bad.  Get real.
B00000HYXB|5.0|I review this album as someone who knows next to nothing about metal.  Rather, I was attracted to &quot;Nightfall in Middle-earth&quot; because I'm a die-hard Tolkien fan, and in this album Blind Guardian spins a roiling rock rendition of Tolkien's &quot;The Silmarillion.&quot;<br />I can't speak knowledgeably of Blind Guardian's technical prowess, though their dense harmonies, rapid-fire double-bass beats and appropriately epic sound overall bowl me over.  Rather, I can only speak to this album's remarkable invocation of the events and moods in &quot;The Silmarillion;&quot; of Fingolfin's desperate challenge of single combat against Morgoth, of Feanor's rage and anguish at the slaying of his father and the theft of the Silmaril's, and on and on.<br />If you're a Tolkien fan (but not necessarily a metal fan), you should look into this album.  If you're a metal fan (but not necessarily a Tolkien fan), why are you reading this review?
B0001NBMBC|5.0|wow, i have heard alot of slams saying, THIS IS NOT OLD SLIPKNOT! well duh, it isnt. its the new slipknot, you cant just sit there and hit a drum a thousand miles per hour cd after cd and expect to keep selling, people will get annoyed and be like, YAY for the first listen and then go, Ummm, lets listen to Blondie, afterwards, when i heard there self titled. i thought it was good, then i heard Corey Taylors voice, and i knew if he put into effect and used it more, they would be GREAT, it took them two awesome albums to make this amazing one, i couldnt believe what i was listing to, they rose above the norm (or abnorm) and showed they had true talent. Dont get me wrong they were talented before. but they hit there peak on this CD, some may not like the change, BUT EVERYTHING CHANGES! this one for the better. So everyone needs to rethink what music really is, because this is it.
B00000G3AZ|3.0|There's no reason this should work as well as it does.  This is a very broad adaptation and the performances in general are unsubtle and broad as well. Ms. Paltrow's accent is heinous, and Ms. Collette's work is frankly annoying (though that is in part as written.) As the movie moves from set piece to set piece, lingering endlessly on the beautiful design, one can't help but think that if Ms. Austen's Emma had actually had so much to do, she'd have been little bored enough to spend so much time meddling in her friends' affairs.  But in the end, the good will evinced by all involved somehow makes a film that charms very much in spite of several and severe flaws.  The BBC version of Emma is much superior in adherence to the Austen story, and Clueless certainly has the edge for humor, but this is a fair adaptation that ultimately is more success than failure.
B00009TB5G|4.0|In this second installment, it's clear that Peter Jackson has tilted his favor decisively against the hobbits and in favor of conventional action heroes of the Tolkien trilogy. The star of the show is clearly Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), while the hobbits (two sets of each) spend much of the movie away from the action.<br />Would a shift like this damage the movie? The answer to this is no. &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; is one of the best yet franetic swashbucklers ever made. And given the current audience tastes in violence, it's more popular than the first installment &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;. It may not be faithful to Tolkien and misplaces much of the charm and whimses of the books, but it really can stand on it's two legs.<br />The second in Tolkien's adaption is that it is a rousing adventure, skillful images of breathtaking beauty, and the marriage of special effects and computer animation.<br />With &quot;The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King&quot; already out on DVD. I really didn't have much to say about the third because it resembles this second one, except it's less dark. I was too bored to type what I &quot;really&quot; had to say about the third so I concocted a negative arguement without saying &quot;just kidding&quot;.
B00024BHTC|1.0|I have to agree with some of these lousy reviews.  When people spend money they expect value.  Nightwish deliver nothing.  The trouble with Nightwish is that they use computerised sound effects of opera all the way through and it sounds flaming terrible.  Get into some proper garage bands you morons!
B000026156|5.0|On my list of ten recordings I will try to take with me when I take that big step into who-knows-where. It is that good. And it is hard to believe that it was recorded 30 years ago. Great cover art too.
038073186X|4.0|Shutter Island is about two federal marshals who go to Shutter Island to investigate a prisoner escape. The island houses a prison for the criminally insane, and upon arrival, they find out that much has been covered-up with respect to this escape. The more they probe, the more questions they have, and soon their vision of reality breaks down as they begin to discover a conspiracy beyond their wildest imaginations.<br /><br />I liked Shutter Island. I love codes, and mysteries, and such, so this was quite a good read for me. Unfortunately, I did see the ending coming, because it seems to be the thing to do these days. I'm not sure how many people it actually surprised, but it didn't surprise me, and that ruined it a little for me. It just seemed that it's been done so much, whether in Fight Club or The Magus decades before.<br /><br />It's quite a concidence that I just read John Fowles' The Magus a few months ago, and the resemblance between the two books are uncanny. In The Magus, it is about this English schoolteacher who meets this eccentric millionaire on a remote Greek island, who employs questionable methods of psychiatry to cure schizophrenic patients, and where he soon finds out that they mounted an elaborate play for his benefit. Sound familiar?
B000003TB6|5.0|This hip hop album from the Roots in 1995 is an excellent blend of Jazz backgrounds and the raps are pretty tight.This is some top of the line hip hop right here.keep bumping this album folks this album here is a great release.<BR>Lyrics 10/10 Production 10/10 X Factor 10/10 Classic 9/10 Me 9<BR>Overall-48/50 This album gets 5 Mics<br />Also Recomended:If your ever in Green Rivers Kentucky go to Miss Patti's 1880s settlement and buy the 2 inch pork chop even a vegetarian you will love the food.I know this has nothing to do with the Roots but still its the best food ever you can also recoomend some other Roots albums
B000294SFW|5.0|I am a huge fan of Motorhead's earlier works like Overkill, Ace of Spades, and Bomber.  In my opinion recent releases have failed to impress, however, Inferno is outstanding!  This is definitely one of Motorhead's more accomplished CD's over the past several years.  Inferno is Bound to be a Motorhead classic.<br />Stand out tracks are: Killers, In the Black, and In the Year of the Wolf.<br />Well Done Motorhead........ 5 stars.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|This album is great because it is moslty a lot of dancable songs that talk about her life and private thing most people are not willing to talk about. Everytime is a great heart-felt song.You can shake ur ass with songs like (I Got That) Boom Boom and Outrageous. I've heard the whole CD and I think it's got pretty good stuff, even though we all know that Britney isn't the greatest singer ever, she did a good job!
B000002I2M|4.0|After some lemons The Doors give us a peach. This is probably the album they would've wanted &quot;Strange Days&quot; to be. This is alot more polished than thier first album, but still has a dark haunting sound. &quot;Riders On The Storm&quot; has become one of my favorites as it's got a thunderstorm in the mix( I can listen to them all day, &quot;LAmerica&quot; has a Sabbath riff written all over it one of Morrison's better trances he's been under, The rest of the songs are hit and miss, but after 4 studio albums that didn't follow up from thier debut this is a far cry better. With the maturity on this album it makes me wonder what would've happened had Morrison not have died.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I really love &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, especially Lorelai and Ms Kim! I've to say i was quite surprised when i first saw GG: i had expected just another boring, silly series ( as there are many). But this is different: It is entertaining, it is funny and -nevertheless- it deals with problems everbody knows (like breaking up with your boyfriend, problems with a class mate ...)
B000002I25|4.0|1966 was showing a loosening of the boundaries of everything, but 1967 it was throughly, and completely undone. The Doors were one of the parties responsible. With thier 1967 debut it was probably the 3rd biggest album to be released that year after Hendrix's &quot;Are You Experienced?&quot;, and &quot;Sgt.Pepper&quot; of course. I honestly feel that the group made a big mistake here though. Yes they wanted to be remembered as a group that made it big, but even with the first single &quot;Break On Through&quot; only making it to 106 on billboard they shouldn't have compromised on &quot;Light My Fire&quot;. That became the next single, and while it went to #1 it was Morrison's masterpiece, and it should've been left in it's almost 7 minute version. People were starting to want the music to be longer than the usual 2-3 minute single it still would've been a monster hit Look at Zepplin's &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot; still at 8:00 long, and it's the #1 most requested song today. Well anyway &quot;Light My Fire&quot; is such a masterpiece I even consider Jose Feliciano's version a year later to be equal to the Door's version. &quot;Soul Kitchen&quot; could've been the next single as it was about 3 minutes long, and it has a punk agnst in it too. I found the &quot;Alabama Song&quot; strictly novelty material as it sounds like something out of Russia. &quot;Back Door Man&quot; was very unbridled, and was also the song done at a Conneticuit concert where Morrison faced his first arrest. I feel that there was even one more masterpiece on this album, and that was &quot;The End&quot;. This was one that broke all the chains of morality in music underscored in Satanism, and the Odepus Complex. Not even the Fugs, the Beatles, the MC5, or the Velvet Underground would touch this one. It was rumored that Morrison had all the lights in the recording studio turned off, and lit a bunch of candles, and when they finished recording this song he poured blood all over the console. This was rock and roll in it's graphic, and psychological raw. This from a man who's father was a Admiral in the U.S. Navy, and after the success of &quot;Light My Fire&quot; his family wanted him to come home, cut his hair, and be close to them again as mentioned in his biography &quot;No One Here Gets Out Alive&quot;. Apparently Morrison didn't find what he was looking for within his family, so he did his thing, and what is left is some of the most interesting if not blatant material ever to embrace a rock album, and some of the most classical music from a decade of liberation and chaos.
6305897786|1.0|I made the mistake of seeing this in the theatre...DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE! It is far and away the most disappointing movie experience of my like.
B000007S5B|2.0|I was so dissappointed with this album. After &quot;Hello I Love You&quot; it took a nosedive which they didn't recover until &quot;My Wild Love&quot; one good accapella song. Then again they fell apart until &quot;Five To One&quot; which is one of my favorite Doors songs. &quot;Love Street&quot; is about as uninspiring as &quot;Pleasant Valley Sunday&quot;, &quot;Not To Touch The Earth&quot;, and &quot;Summer's Almost Gone&quot; are very depressing. The rest are there taking up space.
B00005J6SZ|5.0|As other reviewers before me have very perceptively noted, this IS without doubt one of the best albums of the 1980s. It did shoot Madonna to fame and she deserved every bit of her success! Listening to the first four songs \\"Material Girl,\\" Angel,\\" \\"Like a Virgin,\\" and \\"Over and Over,\\" I felt young, excited, optimistic and happy as I did all twenty years ago when I first heard these wonderfully infectious songs! (It encourages you to reminisce about the good old days, too--as well as the materialism of the '80s! GRIN) Following them is the torchy pop ballad \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore,\\" which Madonna performs very well. \\"Dress You Up\\" is yet another tune that immediately became a global hit for \\"The Material Girl.\\" \\"Shoo-Bee-Doo\\" is a slower ballad that goes well after the faster paced \\"Dress You Up.\\" This album also includes very, very good songs like the slower \\"Pretender\\" and the song \\"Stay.\\" The listener then gets the added plusses of extended dance mixes of \\"Like a Virgin\\" and \\"Material Girl.\\"<br />The sound quality is excellent throughout the entire remastered CD! The liner notes include the lyrics to all the songs and there are a few great shots of Madonna taken at that time, too. A real plus for Madonna fans!<br />Not only is this one of her greatest albums, this CD would also be an excellent introduction to the newcomer who wants to see what Madonna could produce at such an early point in her career. I strongly recommend this remastered CD as a great addition for Madonna fans who only have the original CD or the vinyl album. Only regret: \\"Into The Groove\\" isn't here! Hey! To improve this incredible CD even further, can we use this as a springboard to remaster it yet again as something even more awesome (although there's not too much room to go higher)? Only time will tell.....GRIN
B000002I27|1.0|This is a dissappointing follow up indeed. About as dissapointing at the follow up to Katrina and the Waves follow up to thier monster hit debut. The Doors just released this one too soon I feel. The title cut is somewhat decent, but &quot;You're lost little girl&quot; had a good intro, but they used a key change where there shouldn't have been one, &quot;Love Me 2x's&quot; , and &quot;People Are Strange&quot; have been overplayed, so I know where they stand. &quot;Moonlight Drive&quot;, and &quot;Horse Lattitudes&quot; pretty much save this album from being completely panned by me. &quot;Horse Lattitudes&quot; is probably one of the best poems ever written, but when surrounded by weaker material it's going to get lost in the shuffle. &quot;When The Music's Over&quot; lacks the power and potency of &quot;The End&quot;, and &quot;Unhappy Girl&quot; is annoying with the circus organ. This was obviously a rush job.
B000089J0R|4.0|I would have to agree with what i have read.Dragonforce is a great band off to a great start.The singer is good but the sound of the band overpowers him.The drumming is ok the bass player rules and the guitars are some of the best iv ever heard.The solos are nuts and really,really fast,some of the solos are long to,which i really like.I think this band would be better if they used more keyboards and some crazy intros.Some of there intros are super fast like there playing in the middle of a song.If you really enjoy a band that has a lot of talent speedy riffs and crazy solos some of which are on the level of malmsteen's talent, then i would check out dragonforce.
B00006V9A0|5.0|It has to be said that although  this is my first Nirvana almbum I have just because I'm a big, big fan it will be a biased review probably but you may want to hear it anyway, this almbum is AWESOME
B000005JAB|5.0|This CD was released in 1973; I'm a big fan of the Velvet Underground; I have Cale and Lou Reed's Warhol aural bio, Songs for Drella.  So how come I never stumbled on to Cale's solo work, and his voice that crosses Lou and Leonard Cohen, until getting to Paris 1919 by the roundabout way of Yo La Tengo's cover version of Andalucia.? Who knows, but I intend to make up the loss of 31 years by keeping this CD in the player for months.  Pretty hard to make much sense of it -- what is this &quot;sacheting of gentlemen&quot; that &quot;gives you grievance now and then&quot;?, or what's Martha doing &quot;down in Transvaal where Crocodiles and men fight on&quot; -- but each one of these nine songs (only 31 minutes, very slim!) gets in the mind and stays there.  A sampler: one raucous rocker, Macbeth; one so soft it's almost a wisp, Antarctica Starts Here; one sweet if obscure love song, Andalucia; one peppy hallucinogen, Graham Greene; and one instant all-time favorite, Half Past France, which may be about a World War I German soldier on campaign -- or maybe not.<br />A singular work.  Don't wait a minute longer.
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|this is the most inspiring film ever made it just makes you want to pick up the guitar and play exept you dont wont to miss the film the duel at the end is the best ive ever seen it tells you the story of the misissipi delta blues and the missing song someone said to me that joe satriani played the parts that eugine did but write back and say if he did the film really opened my eyes to steve vai and recently i went to see g3 live i reccamend that as well
B000002H38|5.0|I asked my mother to buy this album for me one day while she was out, and I have never regretted it.  Anita Baker has a voice like no other singer alive, instantly recognizable, full of beauty and elegance.  She really knows how to make you feel a song: we feel the emotional desperation in her voice as she pleads with a lover she's wronged to return to her in &quot;No One In The World,&quot; and we feel the joy coursing through her veins in the exuberant &quot;Sweet Love,&quot; the song that introduced Ms. Baker to the mainstream pop audience in 1986.  That song, along with three other singles, &quot;Caught Up In The Rapture&quot; (the ULTIMATE slow jam, bar none), &quot;No One In The World,&quot; and &quot;Same Ole Love,&quot; established her as a multi-format star - they all hit the top 10 on the R&amp;B and Adult Contemporary charts and cracked the pop top 50.  Even the cuts that weren't singles are terrific, with &quot;Mystery&quot; and &quot;You Bring Me Joy&quot; being my favorites.  All of the songs have a soft, elegant magic, and Ms. Baker injects them with lots of soul.  It's a winning combination.  Although she hasn't quite achieved the same heights of fame as Whitney, Celine or Mariah, she can easily outsing any of them without having to &quot;spice up&quot; her vocals with lots of unnecessary, gimmicky octave-jumping and she doesn't overdo it with the vocal gymnastics.  Anita is still a core artist on most &quot;smooth jazz&quot; stations, as is another unique and beautiful talent who came on the scene shortly before she did, Sade.  Both are among my favorite artists.  The only thing that annoys me about both of them is their practice of making their fans wait an eternity for their next album!  (Case in point: it's been nearly four years since Sade's &quot;Lovers Rock&quot; came out.) Fortunately, we'll finally be seeing a new album from Anita - her first in a decade, not counting the greatest-hits CD - later this year, and the first single, &quot;You'reMy Everything,&quot; is now playing on smooth jazz and urban-adult radio stations everywhere.  And let me tell you, she hasn't lost one bit of the magic that made her such a big star in 1986.  Get this one if you love jazzy soul, soft pop, or just great music.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|I remember being deeply interested in this film after the standard blitzkrieg leading up to the theatrical release.  For some now forgotten reason, I never did see it in the theaters.  I decided to remedy this turn of events upon the DVD release.  I must say, I was struck by the film's scope and power.  It captures the essence of tragedy, and I'm sure Whittier would approve the way the film treats the might-have-beens.  I won't give away too much for fear of spoiling the film's potency, but will say that while the ending is melancholy, it is also heroic, and is a fitting tribute to one of humanity's noble attributes: selfless love.
B000002G30|4.0|One thing is for sure, once I got into &quot;Monster Magnet&quot;, I wished I had done so sooner, and I'm suprised they're not better known. It's pretty much the sound of what every rebel-rocker wants: monster psychedelic riffs, that's equal doses of 70's classic rock, and 90's stoner rock. Not everything is turned up to 11, there's a few melodic tracks as well, but overall it's pretty heavy. &quot;Negasonic Teenage Warhead&quot; is the &quot;hit&quot; here, but the rest is just as awesome. Anyone with a liking for &quot;Kyuss/QOTSA/Soundgarden&quot; should totally dig this.
B000005ALP|4.0|Mark Everett had already made some albums under the name of &quot;E&quot;. 'Beautiful Freak' was the first album under the name of Eels, hoping that his E albums would be standing next to the new ones, totally forgetting about bands like the Eagles.<br />The first track of this album to be released is the indie-classic 'Novocaine for the soul' with a great sample and piano intro. Many instruments are used on this album. Piano, Guitar, Banjo and many samples making it an interesting album to listen to. There are no bad songs and some very good ones. Beloved Monster is fun, Spunky very sweet. The quality of songs got better after this album, but this one is very diverse.
B000002L7R|4.0|In my opinion (and many others), &quot;Prince&quot; released nothing but excellence from the &quot;1999&quot; album, through to &quot;Lovesexy&quot;. &quot;Around The World In A Day&quot; lies right in the middle of those five. The only big hit was &quot;Raspberry Beret&quot;, as &quot;Pop Life&quot; was a minor hit, but almost every track here is great. The more beautiful ones I think are &quot;Paisley Park&quot;, &quot;Condition Of The Heart&quot;, and &quot;The Ladder&quot;, but the others are good as well. This album may not get the praise as those released around it, but it's every bit as good.
B00008H2LB|5.0|okay so maybe you dont agree.thats fine because you dont have to...i love this cd it is my fav cd out right now.i like this better than their last effort,buy it and you will not be sorry.chester is the best singer in rock today and the band never shows off they just stay together.in my mind this is the best rock band ever.my fav songs are...<BR>2.dont stay...i love the sound of this song<BR>5.nice and heavy,just the way i like it.<BR>6.great vocals,smooth sound.<BR>10.my fav.<br />forget the losers who say that this cd sucks...buy it today.
B0002GTWYW|4.0|If a rapper is lucky, or any musician for that matter, they leave the world with one classic album. This is that album from &quot;The Notorious B.I.G.&quot;. It's less bloated and commercial than &quot;Life After Death&quot; was, and is just track after track of top shelf rap. The hits on here are just slightly better than the rest, those are &quot;One More Chance&quot;, &quot;Big Poppa&quot;, and the infamous &quot;Juicy&quot;. I also like &quot;Machine Gun Funk&quot; and &quot;Unbelievable&quot;. The bonus here is a couple more sweet tracks, and a DVD of the videos and extras. Well worth buying again if you're a fanatic. I'd say until he has a proper collection out, this is definitely the best of &quot;B.I.G.&quot;.
B000089RVX|4.0|the title pretty much just tells it all,i love this band they could be the best band in the world if they would just learn to make some of their songs sound well diffrent!they all sound almost the same,but i still love this cd.whatever problems this cd may have all is forgiven when you hear amy sing and ben play the guitar,here is some of my favs<BR>6.the lyrics on this song really made me think<BR>8.i love this song mainly because the way that amy sings it<BR>10.smooth song with a hook that you cant get out of your head.<br />buy this cd if you are a fan of outstanding vocals,smooth guitar work,cool drumbeats and lryics that make you think.
B000002LE6|4.0|&quot;Lovesexy&quot; seemed to be less popular than the four albums that came before it, but I think it's every bit as good. The only hit was really &quot;Alphabet St.&quot;, which is actually one of my least favorite here. &quot;Glam Slam&quot; is the epitome of a great &quot;Prince&quot; song, and &quot;Dance On&quot; has the same energy. Two others that are wonderful are &quot;I Wish U Heaven&quot; and &quot;When 2 R In Love&quot;, both awesome. But the best thing here for me by far is &quot;Anna Stesia&quot;. It's easily one of my ten favorite songs from him, and that's saying alot when you think about it. The disc is also just on one track, so you can't skip any songs (as he intended). Overall, it's the last great album of his &quot;Purple Reign&quot;.
B000002JSN|5.0|Physical Graffiti was my second Led Zeppelin album.  I enjoyed it immediately, but I had no idea just how much it would later grow on me.  Years since listening to it for the first time, it has advanced into probably somewhere around to my third or fifth favorite album.<br />Songs like &quot;Kashmir&quot; are extremely hyped, and while I wouldn't say it's overrated, there is some really great stuff on here besides it.  At first, Disc 1 was largely my favorite.  &quot;Custard Pie,&quot; &quot;Houses of the Holy,&quot; &quot;Trampled Underfoot,&quot; and &quot;Kashmir&quot; are instantly likable songs.  Disc 2 took its time, but now it is at least as good as disc 1.  &quot;In The Light&quot; and &quot;Bron-Yr-Aur&quot; are two of the best songs ever written, and sound absolutely beautiful here performed by Led Zeppelin.  The last few minutes of &quot;In The Light&quot; are music heaven.<br />Best Songs:<BR>In The Light<BR>In My Time of Dying<BR>Bron-Yr-Aur<BR>The Rover<BR>Night Flight<br />Excellent Songs:<BR>Kashmir<BR>Custard Pie<BR>Down By The Seaside<BR>Ten Years Gone<BR>Houses of the Holy<BR>Wanton Song
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I have no idea why you are starting rumors cause Britney is not pregnant she even confirmed she's not!<br />Anyways this album is realy good I suggest you pick a copy up!
B00029NMRM|5.0|My husband and I have seen The Whole Nine Yards at least three dozen times, it is absolutely hysterical! So when the sequel came out we rushed to see it and were not disappointed! I LOVED this movie! I laughed so hard I was in pain! However, the movie won't mean a thing to you if you haven't seen and loved the first. It is a dark comedy with twists and turns that keep you guessing. (What is up with the people that say it was confusing! Yes, you actually have to pay attention and maybe even see it twice!) Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry make an incredible team. My only complaint is the crude language & sex jokes were over the top. (So NO kids around for this flic.) So if you loved the first this is a MUST SEE!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This has to be the best cd of 2003/2004. Britney is an amazing performer and makes amazing songs and this album proves it. The best tracks all the songs on the album except for early mornin which should have been replaced by &quot;The answer&quot;. Britney cd is so versatile and has awesome beats and good production. Britney seems to improve on each cd she makes. Britney will soon be the Queen of pop an theres no denying it. She will be her for a long time
B00008EY65|3.0|I guess I liked this movie but I don't want to see it again.  I'm going to warn you that this has more talking than it does action which got me because I was expecting action, but it was good.  Don't think this doesn't have any action, it has action and it is incredible because of the visual effects.  I would really give this 2 and a half stars because I liked half of the movie.  It's like the X-Men movies, admit they're kind of boring but you have to admit that they're kind of interesting at the same time.  I'm saying that if you really want to see or kind of want to see it then see it but if you don't want to see it than you probably shouldn't see it.  I think you'll think of it like my title: It is not bad......It's also not great.  This is kind of what most of the critics are saying: it has more good than bad and some just don't like it.  So enjoy it or don't enjoy it.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Hmmmmmmm Im kinda suprised I realy dont like Britney but I listened to this album from my brother and I kinda realy like it and it gave me more respect for Britney cause the album is realy realy good!<BR>I think people like me should give her a chance Im glad I listened to it and now I know that she's (...)a great artist to!<br />Im addicted to this album now and my brother is mad because he dosent get to listen to it cause of me ha ha:)<br />Well after this expierince I think Im gonna go check her past albums out!
B00005JMEW|5.0|I call this: Quentin's masterpiece.  I thought this movie was better than The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.  I watched this movie in theatres and thought it was one of the greatest movies in movie history (next to Spider-Man 2).  This movie is pretty much: BLOODY FUN.  I'm going to warn you that this is an ultra-violent tale of revenge but if you get through it, you'll love it.  If you hate violent movies, you'll still like it.  I guarntee you'll love this movie and treat it like gold when you get a copy of the DVD or VHS.  I saw this movie about over 15 or 20 times and I still love it.  I thought it was the best Quentin Tarantino movie so far.  The first time you see it, I know you'll be kind of shocked by how much blood they put in there, but if you watch it more, you'll appreciate the story more and why she's killing all those people.  I don't want to spoil it for you but she has a choice and it's kill or be killed and she chose kill.  It's shocking what horrible things they did to this woman and she wants to fight back and get revenge.  If you haven't seen it yet, listen to me: GO NOW AND RENT IT OR BUY IT AND SEE IT and I know you'll love it.<br />P.S.  I did see volume 2 and if you want to know what I said about click the TOM SEE MORE ABOUT ME button and you'll know and I gave it 2 stars, go see why.
B00024W1D8|4.0|I was literally told &quot;don't rent it&quot; but I am not at all disappointed. I actually thought it was a very different kind of movie. I normally don't pick movies like this but I was kept in my seat even though it was a little longer than most movies. Unless you like to overanalize things and get offended by movies that are meant to be ficitonal you will probably like this flick, I did! Just remember, it's a movie and enjoy it for what it is.
0380778556|5.0|My favorite of Du Maurier's books (that I've read). The mysterious Max De Winter marries a woman much younger than himself, and takes her home to Manderley, his estate. The second Mrs. De Winter is surrounded by the overpowering memories of Rebecca, the deceased first wife of Max, and Mrs. Danvers, Rebecca's loyal housekeeper, who makes no secret of her dislike for the new bride. Suspenseful and haunting, it's a great read!
0783235380|4.0|Just rewatched this movie, &quot;Forces of Nature&quot; late last night. Caught it on the big-screen when it was first shown couple of years back. I like this movie a lot. It's about two people whose lives are put on hold because of strange happenings one after another. And the whole experience led them to fall in and out of love, and ultimately reevaluate the people and things that mean most to them.<br />Ben Affleck is likable in his vulnarable, clueless mode. Remember that this was pre-&quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; and pre-&quot;Beniffer&quot;. In fact, I like his acting in this movie and &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; a lot more than all the other box-office nonsense that he's in. Sandra Bullock is a little wilder and crazy in this movie but still shows her vulnarable side (isn't that why we love her?).
B0000CABBW|5.0|This movie is a gem!  It had a PG-13 rating when we went to see it, but I've seen PG movies with more \\"stuff\\" in them than this movie had.  What a wonderful message this movie has and it captivated my then 7 and 8 year old sons.  Don't be deterred by the rating.  This is a wonderful film.
6305428425|5.0|AWESOME CHICK FLICK!!!! I LOVE this movie! It's about two best friends who go to their high school reunion to try to impress all their old classmates. They reunite with old flames, old crushes, and old allies. I love the  part when they have a &quot;tounge-lashing&quot; with the ex cheerleaders. The dancing scene was weird, but funny. And the movie started with the most perfect song to get you in the mood for the flick: NO DOUBT's 'Just a Girl'. The movie has clever and witty jokes, and is filled with 80's music. Lisa Kudrow (Phoebe on 'FRIENDS') is awesome and really ditsy, Mira Sorvino ('Replacement Killers') is also very fresh and clever! This is anwesom movie for anyone!
B00005OM4N|4.0|Britney Spears' third self-title LP is probably the best album made to court the bubblegum-teen market. The album has some of Spears' best, hookiest material. The lead-off single, &quot;I'm a Slave 4 U&quot; is a brilliant, seductive dance song, helmed by the Neptues. There is an artistry to the song, that was not apparent before in her work. Also good is the ballad, &quot;I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman.&quot; While Spears' voice is still the weakest spot on the album, her performance does convey the vulnerability of the lyrics -- and her massive vocal limitations actually aide the songs poignancy. The schlockiness of her earlier hits are gone, and while the album is still produced within an inch of its life, the songs work. They're gaudy, sure, but one doesn't go to Britney Spears for subtly.<BR>&quot;Let Me Be&quot; is a great dance song, with a stuttering, mechanical string hook. &quot;Boys&quot; sounds great, with its hip-swinging beat, and &quot;Overprotected&quot; and &quot;Cinderella&quot; hark back to the days of &quot;Ooops...I did It Again,&quot; the two songs sound fresh, as opposed to stale leftovers.<BR>The only misstep on this record (and it's a mighty one, at that) is her ridiculous cover of Joan Jett's &quot;I Love Rock and Roll,&quot; which Spears does not have the rock n' roll chops nor the grit to perform. However, her disco-anthem &quot;Anticipating&quot; makes up for that error, beautifully, easily being the most beautiful song on the album. For once Spears sings without any affectations and her voice is (somewhat) free of the sonic gauze and gloss, and hearing her chipmunk chirp singing about the joys of dancing, over the strings makes this record worth is price.
B0001LJCMK|4.0|Apparently I'm smarter than you guys who actually thought this album would be death metal-I actually went to Amazon and listened to the tracks before thinking of buying the CD.  This is not the greatest CD, but it's a lot better than death metal, which sucks.
B000002UZ1|5.0|I have had this on 8-track, vinyl, cassettes, and now finally on CDs. These classic songs only get better with age. My favorite album - ever.
B00006V9A0|2.0|Nirvana was a great band. Most agree. Don't listen to those out there who say &quot;Nirvana is the worst band!&quot; or the crazed fans saying &quot;Kurt is God!&quot;, because Nirvana/Kurt were neither; they were 3 normal guys from Seattle in a band, who happened to be very good. Now, this greatest hits, is, sadly, a dud. It contains some of the essential tracks for anyone who's getting into Nirvana (Teen Spirit, In Bloom, All Apologies, Lithium), but at the same time it contains tracks that I'm a little confused as to why they're on a GREATEST HITS (Penny Tea?). Tracks like &quot;On a Plain&quot;, &quot;Polly&quot;, and &quot;Anuerysm&quot; were left off, while &quot;Been a Son&quot; was put on. Okay.... personal opinion I suppose, but this is hardly the beefy whopper we Nirvana fans have been waiting for (unreleased material -Kurt's recorded tapes, bonus stuff). There is one new track (You Know You're Right), that is mediocre, and it's at the beggining of the album. If you want to experience Nirvana, go out and buy Nevermind, and build upon your Nirvana collection from there, because this isn't worth checking out. An okay tip on the iceburg I suppose.
B0001GOH6Q|1.0|After all the wonderful ads, I was really looking forward to this movie. I was disappointed to realize the ads showed the very best parts. Overall, I thought it was lacking in plot, and it centered around the father character, who was not in the least bit likable. The special effects were good, if a little dark and creepy like everything of Tim Burton's, but special effects cannot carry a bad story.
B0000035E7|4.0|For $600, this album is amazing. The production value is quite good for this garage album. What I really love about this album is it's sound; they obviously used tube amps when recording, giving their music that nice, warm humming sound coming from Krist's bass and Kurt's guitar. Such tracks as &quot;Love Buzz&quot; and &quot;About a Girl&quot; are prime examples of the sound. As well, I really like Kurt's voice on this album in contrast to &quot;Nevermind&quot; or &quot;In Utero&quot; where he tends to scream incessently; his voice is more calm, more in control, and it has much better tone. As for the songs on the album, it is really hit or miss. You have the hits (Love Buzz, School, About a Girl, Big Cheese, Negative Creep), and the misses (Scoff, Mr. Moustache, Sifting, Downer). Although the album does not have pop-hit after pop-hit like Nevermind, nor does it contain the abstract qualities of In Utero, it stands as a great moment in Seattle music, or indie rock for that matter.
6305903182|1.0|I LOVED SCREAM.  When I first saw the TV spots, I was like &quot;Hey, that's like those old slasher films I loved as a kid&quot; and when I saw it, I was blown away.  When I heard it was a Star Wars Trilogy of Terror, I was SO HAPPY.  When part 2 came out I rushed to the theaters - had a great night - and was so excited to see where the characters would go and by the end I was so looking forward to the last part to see how it all came together.<br />However, even in part 2 I saw that the STUDIO was starting to throw their weight around...Hm...Maybe it was nothing.<br />Then part 3 came out.  Guys.  This movie sucked.  Kevin Williamson didn't even get to write it (they THREW OUT HIS TREATMENT REMEMBER?).  He didn't even get to realize his trilogy vision.  Instead, Ehran Kruger did and that guy really blew it. This isn't funny.  This isn't scary.  It's cheesy.  Admittedly, I was intrigued by Sydney's mother's past, but was that the original intent when Williamson wrote it?  Is THAT how he was going to bring it together?  Scream 3 is a rip off of a great movie, namely Scream.  They were making up the script as they went along, folks.  Come on.  This became a cheesy Scooby-Doo mystery.  I realize this came out when Columbine was fresh on everyone's mind so they were trying to be more cheesy to take the edge away.  But they SHOULD HAVE WAITED until Williamson was done with HIS real magnum opus &quot;Teaching Mrs. Tingle&quot; and until things cooled down a bit in the media and then made the REAL Scream 3, not this lame attempt at the Weinsteins' wanting money. <br />Of course I bought the boxed set.  I accept that THIS is the Star Wars Trilogy of Terror that we're stuck with.  But somewhere in the back of my mind, I'll still be that guy watching Scream 2, greatly anticipating the end of a great trilogy.<br />Unfortunately, that great end will never come.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|this movie is absolute genius. i watched it with my brother after i said it looked dumb and it turned out to be one of my favorites. if you like messed uo movies or movies in general, buy this dvd.
B0001AVZA8|2.0|I was surprised that this movie was recommended to me.  It had moments of humor, but all in all I was left feeling disappointed.  Not to mention that I felt embarassed watching this with my mother since there's full on frontal nudity--and it ain't pretty!  It was also totally unnecessary, which just left me wondering WHY??<br />The story was okay, but I had a hard time believing the characters motives.  Why are these people becoming couples?  It didn't seem real and the writers/director didn't seem to care.
B00005A0N5|1.0|I don't even own any of nightwish's CD's but i am glad i could review it and thankfully never have to say i actually own any of thier cd's.  They may be good and all that i will never know just not my style.<br />I recommended kidney thieves to a forum and Nightwish was a recommendation in return
0765310015|5.0|Before telling you my opinion about the book, I'd like to adress some issues that amazed me when reading some of the reviews here. <BR>First, the notion that nothing is ever explained in the book. True but that's one of the best things in the series. Erikson trusts his readers to be intelligent enough to find the truth (if there is such because every character sees it differently) themselves, not spoon-feed them with the factology. You won't see a certain character explaining to another for example what's a warren, just like you won't see anyone explaining to somebody what's a radio in our world. A lot more things make sense after you have read the next books and then reread &quot;Gardens...&quot;. Hints are being dropped left, right and center and details that are just confusing the first time around become vital in the reread. It's one of the best series, if you, like me love to read your favorite books over and over again. Secondly, yes it could be a confusing book and it's has some inconsistancies wth the latter volumes because it was written nearly ten years prior to &quot;Deadhouse Gates&quot; (the second book). Yes, it has a bit too many interventions from Deus Ex Machina but trust me things get much better in the next books in that department. The Malazan series has so many characters that you can hardly expect all of them to have depth but those of them who have more screen time like Paran are well developed and the minor ones if not anything else, at least do not annoy the reader unlike those from the Wheel of Time. There are a lot of super powerful beings in the series but in a way they counter each other and the balance is kept, thus a lot of them use humans and subtle tricks to complete their goals, it's not as if battles of anihilation between gods and the likes rage all the time. <BR>The strenghts of the book - very original concepts, a huge and very well developed world with ancient history, complicated multi-layered plot, interesting battle scenes.Ability to use language in a way some other fantasy authors are hardly aware that it existed *cough* Eddings *cough*. The perfect series for everyone not afraid to use his brain while reading fantasy and tired of all the stupid genre cliches.
B00005RFAI|4.0|The first album was cute but this one is better. The sound she had for this album seems to fit her better. My favorite is &quot;My Vietnam&quot; and &quot;Family Portrait&quot;. &quot;Don't Let me get me&quot; is close to home for me. This is my anthem. Her future albums should sound a lot like this one.
0316168815|2.0|After all the focus from the press and hype I've heard about this book, I decided to give it a try.  It was one of my poorest choices of the year, and wished my $20 was spent elsewhere.<br />I was, frankly, attracted to the book by its first few pages (that was what lured me to purchase it).  The story flowed nicely for the first chapter or so, before it began to repeat itself.  Motions and dialogues repeat, relationships amazingly odd (especially that of Ruth and Ray...would a childhood crush last a lifetime for those who still have to live their lives?), but most of all-- no plot, no climax, no nothing.<br />I don't know what I have went through after reading the entire book.  This is one of the few books that I could put down after reading for every 2 minutes.<br />To be fair, it was creative, and the language has a nice flow to it.  But it cannot be said as good fiction.
0425188809|4.0|As with many of Kings book's, a rereading of Watchers brings a number of Koontz cliches into sharp focus (see lady naava's review).  If you are familiar with the genre and Koontz in particular, either skip this one or read some negative reviews to prepare you for some of the cheesy, too-convenient Koontz cliches. (...)<br />That said, this book is an incredibly effective page turner.  This is as far from a slow starter as you are likely to find, and is the polar opposite of a slogging march to \\"disappointment-land\\" like Pet Cemetary.  It's certainly not high culture, there are some self-serving plot devices (bordering on juvenile male fantasy--brooding loner with heart of gold rescues damsel, etc.) and the novelty of the idea of a chimera has worn off a bit (this book is pre-Discovery Channel), but as a light entertainment and stay-up-all-night page-flipper, this book is awfully effective.  <br />If you love dogs, want a good scare (might not be as scary as it was 10+ years ago), and can stomach some of Koontz's romantic plot devices, this will probably be an all-time favorite. If not, better to skip it.
006072448X|4.0|This novel was painful to read, yet I couldn't rip my eyes off its pages.  Great story, but I wondered why Shriver needed to bog down the book by using words one would only encounter on the SAT's - became obnoxious at times.  <br />This book definitely makes you think twice about having or wanting kids!!
B00005JLR8|5.0|This is a film that will haunt for some time.  The acting is superb; the script well-written.  It is a true gem, quite different from Hollywood fare.
B0002GTWYW|5.0|Almost a decade ago rap legend The Notorious B.I.G. (Christopher Wallace) dropped a Hip Hop classic with &quot;Ready to Die&quot;. Biggie was a very talented, versatile Rapper who brought the East back into the limelight with this release and whos influence still exists today (Just look at the rappers who have followed in his footsteps). The remastered version (2004) features two first class bonus tracks in &quot;Who Shot Ya&quot; and &quot;Just Playing&quot; (Dreams). The DVD contains the Notorious music videos for this album (Big Poppa, Juicy, Warning, One More Chance) and a live performance of &quot;Unbelievable&quot;. This album is a masterpiece that should be in every Rap collection, full of tracks that became anthems to a whole generation. I have listened to thousands and thousands of songs and have many favourites but &quot;Juicy&quot; is without a doubt my all time favourite Rap track. One thing I like about this being rereleased, is that hopefully a whole new generation of Rap fans will pick this up and appreciate. One Love
B000003TA4|1.0|Why must I review this album again? Partly because I want a higher reviewer rank, but for the most part I want to show prospective buyers that you can't trust the positive reviews on here. To a certain extent, this applies to all album reviews, but it is rampant for this album. Here we go...<BR>I was just scrolling through the reviews for this album, and I've realized that most of the 5 star reviews for this album are from complete idiots. They have no clue about music and I think most of them are MTV-conforming 8th graders with little intelligence, so I see how they can relate to Kurt Cobain :) Here are some quotes: 1) &quot;The beggining is scary&quot; [re: Territorial Pissings] Yes it is, maybe you should go watch Teletubbies instead. 2) &quot;This album marked the arrival of one of the true great musicians of our time -- Dave Grohl.&quot; LOL NO. 3) &quot;If you take time and listen to it and try to feel kurts anger and just try to understand the way he feels the maybe you'd feel more appreciative about this record. Kurt put everything that was going on in his life at the time into this record and look at the result&quot; Ummm... 99% of artists incorporate what's going on in their life... good point [sarcastic]. 4) &quot;They showed their talent when they did the MTV Unplugged in New York. They showed the whole world that they could really play&quot; Yeah, I can &quot;really play&quot; these songs too, cuz they're so freaking easy. 5) &quot;Track eight is a popular favorite &quot;Drain You&quot;. This song illustrates the effects of love and hate. &quot;Lounge Act&quot; starts off with a great bass strum into a poppy chorus. Song ten is the screaming loud song &quot;Stay Away&quot;. &quot;On a Plain&quot; follows as Kurt fills us in on his poor background and childhood.&quot; Nice one sentence descriptions. If it were so good maybe you could elaborate? If I could rate your writing ability I would give it a negative value. 6) &quot;...Kurt Cobains awsome guitar solos and screaming vocals. There is no duplicate of Nirvana. i've heard other bands try to play smells like teen spirit and its almost imposible to make it sound anywere near as good&quot; Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah? Too dumb to comment on. 7) &quot;Kurt Cobain used a lot of meaning to his songs and he should be credited for that, along with his great guitaring. Kurt may have used less guitar on some songs, but on other songs, like In Bloom, he uses a lot of hard sequences (you try to do that song on the guitar and email me!)&quot; I hope English isn't your first language. By the way, did you get my email?. <BR>In conclusion, this CD is a poor excuse for music, and to think that Nirvana is so highly regarded, it is disgusting.
B00005JMSE|5.0|Hellboy rule and is the greatest movie evr made. It has action, humor, and everything elsea movie needs in order to be great. A must see!
B00000AFDW|3.0|KISS is a great band, and I was so excited to hear about their reunion back in 98. I bought &quot;Psycho-Circus&quot; the day it came out. It has that great &quot;KISS&quot; sound that we haven't heard since &quot;Creatures of the Night&quot;. Actually &quot;Psycho-Circus&quot; sounds like it was written right around the time of &quot;Creatures&quot;. The songs are fun, metal anthems that were popular back in the 80's. And KISS provided a nice alternative to the Green Day's &amp; Prodigy's of the late 90's radio with &quot;Psycho-Circus&quot;. If you are a fan of 80's metal, you should really pick up this disk, it you like KISS's &quot;Animalize&quot; or &quot;Asylum&quot; cd's then &quot;Psycho-Circus&quot; is perfect for you. The opening title track is great, and a powerful opening to the album. &quot;We Are One&quot; is a neat little acoustic number that you will be singing along with after just one listen. My two favorite songs are &quot;Within&quot;. Gene's growling vocals drive this song, and this should be considered a KISS classic. And I love the insider type jabs taken at the band and the fans on &quot;You Wanted the Best&quot;. The humor showcased in this song is great, and comes wrapped in such a guitar heavy package, every metalhead should be satisfied. The only thing I didn't like about &quot;Psycho-Circus&quot; was the cut &quot;Dreamin'&quot;. This song is basically a remake of the Alice Cooper Band's  song &quot;Eighteen&quot;. I couldn't believe it when I first heard it, the opening guitar chords are Glen Buxton's, and instead of Alice chanting &quot;Eighteen&quot; you get Paul chanting &quot;Dreamin'&quot;?? Not sure why KISS included this tune on the disk. But overall &quot;Psycho-Circus&quot; will satisfy your hair metal needs and is a great party album. Hell, I see used copies for under $1 listed here, and you can't go wrong with that.
B00003CXAA|5.0|personally, I thought Godfather II was the best out of the three films. I loved the fact that the movie kept fading from Michael's reign as Godfather to Vito Corleone's in 1920s New York and his olive oil (wink wink) business. great storytelling on Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Copolla's respective parts in II.<BR>Godfather was a classic, no mistake in that..what's weird is that the movie makes the audience love the mafia...never have I seen the mafia world portrayed from the inside out so unbelievably.<BR>part III was a bit disappointing...really made us want more of Michael Corleone and the rest of the family.
B0002234LS|5.0|When I rented this movie, I didn't know what to expect.  I don't read Stephen King and I don't remember the theatre release of this movie.  During the entire movie, I just kept asking myself is he writting a book, dreaming, or just crazy?  The PG-13 rating is OK and the movie contains just enough blood.  I find less is more.  You won't be disappointed with this movie.  Just don't rent it, buy it.
B0001AP12G|5.0|this album is definitely stacked with cuts, top to bottom...first off, of course...through the wire's catchy hook,never let me down, all falls down are my personal favs.<BR>What's so hot is that he's got Jay-Z, Luda, Common, Mos Def, Freeway &amp; Talib Kweli, whom I listen to on a daily basis...I also loved how Kanye threw in famous joints in Chicago in his &quot;through the wire&quot; video...made me reminisce about the windy city with Harold's Chicken, Leons, and WGCI...this is quite possibly the greatest hip-hop album since Nas' illmatic...definitely hot
B000069AUI|3.0|I bought this album after it won a Grammy for record of the year for &quot;Clocks,&quot; a song that I loved.  I was hoping that the Cd would measure up as well, as I had heard &quot;The Scientist&quot; and liked that too, but I was a little disappointed.  I thought a few of the songs were dull and mediocre, but maybe because this isn't my favorite style of music?<BR>Overall, its an alright CD... I wish I had borrowed it from a friend before I bought it though, not sure I would have bought it.
B0000067X1|1.0|This album is terrible.  It's no more than a series of drum &amp; guitar solos that have no melodies or redeeming factors.  I wanted to like this album after some compared it to Radiohead, but this is nothing more than self-indulgence and pure &amp; simple: BAD MUSIC.  There is no such thing as a lost classic...there is a reason that they are &quot;lost&quot;.
B00029LNHS|5.0|This is the album that introduced me to the entire genre of hip hop, introduced me to my favorite musical act out there, and most importantly, over a year after buying the originial copy of Elephunk, it still sits in my CD player and is one of the most played CD's I own.<BR>   Whether or not you have hard of any of the Peas' songs, or if you are a fan of hip hop or pop or whatever, you really should buy this CD.  From the very first song until the very last (&quot;Third Eye,&quot; a hidden track after &quot;Where Is The Love) the beats, ryhmes, and talent of all four members of this group amaze me.<BR>   I don't think words can adequately explain how good this CD is.  Even if it had cost $50, I would be happy with the purchase.  Go get it now! :)
B00005JMEW|4.0|This film is mostly geared toward anyone who loves 70s exploitation films, particularly martial arts films. Although I think Quinten is a very creative filmaker, I dont think he is a very good action director. Hardly in the catagory of John Woo!  But it was a decent effort. The over the top violence was obviously taken from Japanese director Miki (Dead or Alive, Ichi the Killer etc..) I'm giving 4 stars for the creativity and the homage to asian filmaking. If you liked this movie then do yourself a favor and check out the japanese and chinese directors and the films that KILL BILL is referencing... Dead or Alive, Ichi the Killer, Any Chinese language John Woo film and of course any Shaw Bros. martial arts film (Dirty Ho, Invincible Shaolin, Fist of White Lotus just to name a few good ones.)
B0001AP12G|5.0|My friend finally convinced me to pick up this album, and at $9.99, I figured it wouldn't be so much of a loss if I didn't like it, so I did.  <BR>Now, I listen to it every few days, even though I bought it months ago.  Whether or not you are a fan of hip hop, this album will most probably strike a chord with you.  Crazy beat, ryhmes, lyrics... Kanye's got it all.  Can't wait for his next album.

B000059H9E|5.0|\\"Live Flesh\\" begins with Victor Plaza being born on a bus in Franco's Spain in 1970 and ends, twenty six years later, with... well, I wont spoil the ending; but typically with Almodovar, it is fitting and poetic. In between, we follow Victor on his journey into manhood, as he learns the hard way about disillusion, betrayal, love, lust, life, death, and tragedy. <br />As a young man, Victor believes that a one-off sexual encounter with a beautiful Italian junkie is something more than it is, and pesters her to such an extent that she draws a gun on him in order to get him to leave. A struggle ensues. The gun accidentally goes off, and although noone is hurt, it brings the unwelcome attention of two policemen. Another struggle ensues. Another shot is fired. One of the policemen is paralysed from the waist down. From then on, all four of their lives become tragically entwined; with deception and misunderstanding leading towards bitterness and envy. Inevitably, the lies are stripped away, unwanted truths are revealed, and all the various dilemmas are resolved amidst a scene of emotional and actual carnage. <br />This must sound like heady stuff, almost melodramatic? It is. This is Almodovar, after all. There is the usual complex plotting that reveals the strains that pull apart and bring together relationships while the emotional lives of the characters are laid bare. There is the relentless drive to resolve the emotional dilemmas while avoiding sentimentality. In short, there are all the usual touches that one expects from Almodovar, including the wonderful acting from the cast. Wonderful! A film that will draw you back again and again and again.

B00003Q43A|1.0|Normally I don't use reviews as a forum for sniping at other reviewers, but it would appear that Thomas B. Clark came as close as he could to calling me un-American because I didn't care for the jingoism that saturates this film.  Well by golly, I guess it is now clear that this film must be a litmus test of the patriotism of all Americans.  If you hate it, you must be some sort of com-symp pinko --- it's off to the Russkies with ya.<br />Incidentally --- I would have refrained from socio-political commentary if only you had also --- I would gently remind you that the Indian Air Force is reported to have done very well against the USAF in exercises conducted in February this year, so maybe the USA really isn't the only one who can get the job done.  I'd be willing to bet that the Israeli Air Force, to name just one, might be able to hold its own as well.  Of course, maybe I am just whining again.<br />The argument also seems to be that critics (in addition to being part of the 5th Column) cannot endure a film that engages in make-believe.  You can't be serious.  Just because a film requires the viewer to suspend belief doesn't necessarily mean it has to suck.  I enjoyed &quot;Hellboy,&quot; &quot;Men in Black,&quot; and &quot;Alien,&quot; for example.  None of these is remotely believable, but they are well-crafted films with decent performances from their respective casts.  Likewise, films packed with explosions &amp; mayhem can also have compelling storylines &amp; characters --- &quot;Master &amp; Commander,&quot; for example.  I guess I am guilty of expecting the makers of a movie --- even one that is &quot;just fun,&quot; should give us more for our money than some paint-by-numbers hack job.<br />And that is exactly what this movie is, Thomas B. Clark.  Contrary to what you claim, I hardly did any nit-picking on all the plot holes in the story, although other reviewers have gone over this movie's silly inconsistencies with a fine-toothed comb.  My main complaint was that with the disengaged acting, the cardboard-cutout characters, and the painfully predictable storyline, all the movie really could rely on is lots of special effects &amp; nifty explosions, which really on works on the big screen.  The commercial success of this turkey has only encouraged Hollywood to even greater FX excess, to the point that filmmakers seem to think that if they throw enough CGI and special effects at you, they are not responsible for also giving you a decently-crafted movie with a plot &amp; characters and stuff like that.<br />Hey, it's your money.  I spent $1.50 at the budget theatre watching this and I guess I broke even.  I pity the people who blew 7 or 8 dollars for this, but again, spend it on what you want.  I learned my lesson sooner rather than later.  Being the anti-American creep that I am, I just purchased a nice bottle of the 2000 Canon-la-Gaffeliere, which is the equivalent of about 10 viewings of &quot;ID4&quot;-type films, and I think I got the better end of the deal.t was that with the disengaged acting, the cardboard-cutout characters, and the painfully predictable storyline, all the movie really could rely on is lots of special effects &amp; nifty explosions, which really on works on the big screen.

B0000BWVCL|4.0|I'm not sure why another reviewer called this &quot;TRASS&quot; (I think they meant &quot;TRASH&quot;).  This movie was a lot better than the first X-Men movie.  It has a lot more characters, including Nightcrawler, who is one of my favorite mutants.  But I was disappointed because Cyclops was not in that much of the movie (his absence is my reason for a four-star rating instead of a five).<br />The story begins at the White House with an attempt on the President's life by Nightcrawler, a mutant who is being mind-controlled by William Stryker, the movie's villian.  Stryker later comes into the President's office and convinces the president that the mutant who tried to kill him might have been hired by Xavier (Patrick Stewart).  Stryker is given presidential permission to visit Xavier's school for the gifted to quesiton him.  He instead descends upon the school with armed soldiers and steals Cerebro, Xavier's special program for enhanced telepathy.  He tries to use this program to annihilate all the mutants.  The rest of the movie shows the good mutants trying to thwart Stryker's evil plan.<br />There are no action sequences as good as the initial Nightcrawler attack on the president, but there's plenty of great action in this movie.

B000089RVX|2.0|... if we lived on some kind of Bizzaro Earth. Although I must admit that I really enjoyed this album at first, it quickly grew stale. Of course, I'm a bigger fan of the European metal/rock/whatever scene, so that's affecting my opinion to a certain degree.<br />To me, this is just a typical American \\"been there, done that\\" product, which brings nothing new to the mix, and often ends up ruining stuff that was actually decent to begin with. Everything's just so GLOOMY. I mean, I love me some gloomy/depressing/etc. music, but what is contained within \\"Fallen\\" is just gloom and doom with no REAL substance. It's all whining and moaning and groaning. In other words, it's just easily forgettable trash.<br />Now, you may have noticed that I gave it a WHOLE TWO STARS. That's primarily because it did alright for a bit... you know, BEFORE I realized I had wasted my money.<br />And to make the story even sadder is that I wasn't introduced to this band via Daredevil, which I hear was not very good itself, but via Enter the Matrix (Going Under plays during the ending credits, FYI), which itself was at best a mediocre movie tie-in. Well, not JUST a tie-in, since the Wachowski Bros. are all about cutting their story up into little pieces so we'll be forced to spend way too much money to get them all together again in order to really \\"understand\\" the plot of the Matrix trilogy (which, of course, became so convoluted by the end, it just got BLAH). ALAS. I'm getting off topic here.<br />To sum things up, Evanescence easily appeals to the mindless consumer automatons that roam the face of this planet, especially in the United States. I give them two thumbs up... which signals to the firing squad to put them out of their misery. I AM THE WALRUS, BABY.
B000000W5N|5.0|Sticky Fingers is no more a drug album than the world is a heavy place, or so Keith Richards once said.  One of the handful of greatest albums of any genre, Sticky Fingers defies criticism.  From the opening suspended chord of Brown Sugar to the final strings of Moonlight Mile, on Mick Taylor's first Stones album proper (he played a few notes on Let It Bleed) everything is right.  The funk break in Can't You Hear Me Knocking, the mean woman blues of You Gotta Move, the Otis Redding copy I Got The Blues, Paul Buckmaster's strings on Moonlight Mile, the Gram Parsons's \\"influenced\\" Dead Flowers and Wild Horses (Keith recently admitted that he can't recall the extent of Parsons's writing those songs due to the drug haze surrounding the sessions), the harrowing heroin horror-show of Sister Morphine, and the violent R&B/Rock that the Stones had perfected and were more than happy to flaunt on Sway (my personal favorite), Bitch, and Brown Sugar offer an encyclopaedic masterful display of music.  The fact that this baby opens with greatest single ever only seals its fate and every serious (or even joking) record collection should reserve an important place for Sticky Fingers.  If you don't own it, you don't enjoy rock music.

By the way, Kate Winslet is perfect and Alan Rickman gets the girl.

If you want a classic cd get GZA's liquid swords. GZA smokes NAZ on lyrical ability. I don't even want to mention my man Pharaohe Monch. Don't by the CD it is way to hyped up. Save your Money.

B00005JKJA|5.0|Director David Lynch always polarizes his audience. The Webster's definition of polarize is: To cause to concentrate about two opposing positions.  That's what watching a Lynch film is all about, and it always baffles and amuses me when certain people take Lynch to task for being obliquely evasive.<br />What we have in Mulholland Drive is a sophisticated director's surrealistic vision of a highly refined dream world. Both dialogue and visual metaphors abound in many of Lynch's films, and I'm pleased to say that the Mulholland Drive's story is explored in the director's usually understated, though deliberately jarring, manner. Instead of going into the meaning of this film (which many have admirably attempted, even though it can be an exercise in futile subjectivity when it comes to Lynch), I think that I have more insight to give as far as what this kind of film means to me).<br />Although the cast, with Naomi Watts in particular displaying impressive range and depth, is memorably quirky and uniformly interesting, it is the framing of each scene and the flow between them that creates such a captivatingly edgy atmosphere. I've noticed that Lynch often will frame a shot as if it were to be photographed or painted, and this is no surprise since he began as an abstract expressionist painter.<br />Much credit as well should be given to Lynch for his judicious use of Angelo Badalamenti's moody film score as it is so effective in magnifying the dreamy glossiness into a tangible nightmare reality.<br />Of course, no matter how much I think that David Lynch is one of the world's most uniquely transformative filmmakers with Mulholland Drive being one of the most galvanizing, hallucinatory, and sadly affecting movies ever made, there will always be those who simply feel that behind the refined, wryly surreal surface qualities of the film lay nothing more than manipulative mood theatrics, with the actors seemingly there  more for decorative, rather than realistically emotive, purposes. I don't see these things as negatives, however. Here's why. Approaching his art in a painterly fashion, Lynch's images and sound work together in greater sympathy than is typically the case in film. This means Lynch conveys feelings by using emphasis and de-emphasis as if he were painting. Its as if he sees a particular scene as a primary color, and then proceeds to exagerate the hue, i.e. mood, by directing with broader, more dramatic strokes when he sees fit.<br />No one actor is the axis for it is the overall effect of the images and sounds utilyzed within a scene that creates the feel. Its not about how &quot;realistic&quot; the acting or events are, its all about how everything works as one in service of that great intangible, mood. The merging of the two diametrically opposed worlds of reality and dreams creates quite a tangible otherworldliness. I'd say David must be doing something right because, really, who else does this kind of filmmaking with the same flair? Its such a uniquely individual style that the term &quot;Lynchian&quot; is now commonly used as an adjective for the surreal. I am aware of the term &quot;Cronenbergian&quot;. I do think director David Cronenberg is a visionary surrealist who shares some similarities with Lynch, but their methods of approach and aims, not to mention humor, are quite different.<br />It is quite common in Mulholland Drive and other of Lynch's films to feel an overall stillness, as if indeed viewing the painting of a dream world. The film / painting analogy is so common as to be a cliche, but the oddly detatched feel of Lynch's work has an air of mystery about it that, like an abstract expressionist painting, draws in anyone who cares to look at the imaginary recesses. The naysayers will say that this kind of approach to filmmaking achieves nothing more than simulated depth. I however, think Lynch's films have an uncommon degree of depth because of what they suggest.<br />Mulholland Drive suggests a number of possibilities, like all art that's worth a damn. In other words, where I believe the strength of this film lies in its suggestion of ambiguity.<br />It shouldn't have to matter whether or not there is a specific intent because we experience what we bring to the table, so to speak.<br />The viewer is allowed to freely interpret it as it suits them, and this is why I think this movie, for instance, divides people so. For some, the result is seemingly difuse. A common complaint by Lynch's detractors is that he suggests too much and delivers too little, thereby leaving &quot;loose ends&quot;.<br />For others, myself included, there are no &quot;loose ends&quot;, only possibilities that suggest freedom of interpretation within the context that the director presents.<br />I argue that Mulholland Drive's (and this of course goes for other Lynch films as well) point is recontextualizing the suggestions as the delivery. Its about the journey being all the points of its own destination (If I ever write a review of Lynch's 'Lost Highway', I would definitely want to state that).<br />The key to getting something out of Mulholland Drive, and other remarkable David Lynch films, that will resonate on a personal level, is to perhaps, ask yourself this: &quot;Do I prefer to be in control of my dreams or do I feel curious enough to surrender to them and stop questioning their validity?&quot;<br />I for one prefer to just go with an experience such as this and realize that what I see is, in and of itself, its own reason for being.

B000051YEG|5.0|Add my praise to the many comments here.  This has GOT to be the coolest album ever recorded.  It was so ahead of its time its not even funny.  Gainsbourg is a superb artist, anything you can find of his is worth listening to, but Melody Nelson is his masterpiece.  Its by turns funky, haunting, leering, dirty and beautiful beyond description. The coolness factor on this one is sky high.  J'taime ce des disques, son merveilleux!!!
B0000025JT|4.0|Admittedly I am much more of a Barry Gibb/Bee Gees fan than a Streisand one, so much of the appeal of this album is based on Barry Gibb's instantly recognizable songwriting and production style.  However, this is a rare instance where a truly first-rate vocalist takes her shot at pure pop music.  The results, to put is simply, are spectacular, and a once-in-a-lifetime classic.<br />Streisand found Barry Gibb at the absolute top of his game as a writer and producer, and added a strong and sure voice to the laid-back, butter-smooth melodies and harmonies of the Brothers Gibb.  How he was able to reign in some of Barbra's occasional vocal excesses remains a mystery, but it is not just Streisand's best album, it is arguably the best one Barry Gibb ever produced, too.<br />Although &quot;Guilty&quot; and &quot;Woman in Love&quot; are the most-well known tracks on the album (the latter being of the absolute best pop songs of the late 70s/early 80s), most of the tracks are strong performers.  Except for perhaps &quot;The Love Inside&quot; which drags somewhat and &quot;Run Wild&quot;, which isn't sure where it wants to go, that is.<br />The real sleeper here is &quot;Promises&quot;.  It was released as a single, and was little-noticed, but in its own way, it is the pinnacle of the album.  The easy-going groove is easy to get lost in, and one of the handful of tunes I can play endlessly without tiring of it.<br />&quot;What Kind of Fool&quot; is an exercise in meloncholy, but is a vocal gem.<br />&quot;Make It Like a Memory&quot; is the last, and longest track.  Starting off slowly and gently, it builds in both drama an momentum until it explodes in a classic Bee Gees-style stomp, leaving the listener feeling like he or she just had a whole pan of double-fudge brownies.  A completely &quot;Guilty&quot; pleasure!
B0001LJC2K|4.0|I'll admit it sounds a lot like Radiohead...a little like Queen, some Erasure, maybe some modern thrash...maybe even some Gershwin? Most music these days is a giant glass of something mixed in some sort of garbage disposal. Shinning point of this CD and this group, they sound good. I can't deny that. I also find myself looking for the next SRV, the next Jeff Buckley, and album to tie me over till Radiohead, Fionna Apple or U2 puts something out. This album should give you a nice fix, a short one, but a nice one. Enjoy it, it's music, it don't hurt. I would like to see this group grow, hopefully they will and when they do, they will be great. They're just really good now.
B00005JKZV|3.0|...but definitely better than Part 1. I enjoyed this one a lot!!! Thank goodness Chicago won Best Picture though, otherwise I was going to be upset.
B000000H4V|5.0|As a big Sepulfan I'm a fan of all there albumns but this is only second to Beneath the Remains. Arise is awesome to and its hard to compare that to this beacause the music styles are so different but overall Id say this wins it. Chaos A.D. was when Sepultura added there tribal element, that they took a lot further in Roots, and when they got a lot slower like in the song Amen. There are still some good fast ones too like Bitoch is Godzilla. Really all the songs are awesome except I think Amen could be expendable, the song seemed like it was just kinda dragging along. Of course the obvious standouts are Refuse/Resist, Territory, and Slave New World which all had music videos made. And the tribal jam Kaiowas is really cool to. All of this is kept up by Igor Calaveras awesome drumming which I think reached its peak in this albumn. The bonus tracks are really cool with a Amen/Innerself medly and live tracks of Territory and Kaiowas.<BR>So all in all if your willing to slow down a little from Beneath the Remains and Arise and experiment a little or if your a fan of Roots definitly pick this one up.
