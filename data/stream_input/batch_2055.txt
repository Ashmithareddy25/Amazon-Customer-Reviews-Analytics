B007SGM084|5.0|I'll admit that I was really hesistant to read Fifty Shades. But, once I read the sample, I was hooked. The obstacles that Christian and Anastasia overcome within such a short period of time made this a great book. I wish that the author would have left it more open for more books. The one thing that I could have done without is the &#34;f&#34; word. I felt that the book would have been just as good without using that word all the time.
B00A757EFW|4.0|My kids LOVE this game and when I tell them it was around when mommy was their age, they just laugh...and so do I!!!!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This was much better than the first and second book's.  The end was better and much more romantic.  I believe less is more.  More to imagination.
B000002INR|4.0|Great song!  Bought it for back ground music while I work.  Will be back for more songs soon!!! Enjoy the great music of this generation.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|The film tells of an Oklahoma family, the Joads, who lose their farm in the Great Depression and become migrant workers, ending up in California. The film covers their arduous journey across the U.S. en route to California in search of work, and the chilly welcome they received there, starting with their stopping at a crowded migrant campground filled with other starving and jobless. Basic problem was the overcirculation of flyers advertising for agricultural workers, then owners cutting wages as more and more workers showed up; any resisters were labeled 'Reds' and run off the property and out of town.<br /><br />The Joads do find work, but at low pay and quickly eaten up by high food prices in the company store. Today American workers are increasingly facing competition from Asia, Mexico, and illegals from Mexico, lowering wages and taking jobs.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game to keep my kids occupied.  I would highly recommend this game to any of my friends.
B002JH3TW8|5.0|Got this to connect several hard drives that are firewire capable to my computer but are the older 400 version.  Connector arrived on time, packaged well, and works great.  I got the longer adapter because there isn't a lot of space between connection ports on the back of my mac mini and the shorter adapters might have taken up more space that necessary.  I also like the flexibility that this adapter provided in the back.  Definitely recommended this to anyone looking for a 400/800 adapter.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Takes alot of $ to level up fast, but it's a good time passer. Definitely give it a try !
B00AWTTUHI|1.0|Yes, I watched and enjoyed Part I. No, I haven't read any of the graphic novels. Yes, I understand that this takes place in a parallel dimension. But still, watching this felt like a train wreck, from the first villain (a trope grab bag: swastika pastied neo natzi manwoman?) to the last huzzah (Batman, in his high-tech armor, riding through Gotham on a black stallion like something from a Jane Austen novel?). The concept of a future Earth where we're still in a cold war with soviet Russia, where certain superheros have sold themselves out to become the WMD for a corrupt and imbecilic American government, is a weird mishmash of different eras of real Earth history that does not appeal to me in the slightest. Jumping from bad guy to bad guy with no rhyme or reason is also annoying. The link between swastika pasty girl and Joker is weak at best, then there's no indication as to who the next antagonist really is. The new commissioner? The American government? Batman himself? The president's superhero lapdog? The Communists? The Mutants? The apathetic people of Gotham? Those weird flying doll things?<br /><br />While the idea that Batman might be able to make Gotham City, the most corrupt and dangerous city in the world, a bastion of hope in a post-apocalyptic world, is an interesting one, it's not an idea that's very well explored. It's also muddled up in the other weak subplots: How far will an older, cynical Batman go for justice?; Will Robin be a successful successor to Batman?; Or, does the torch of Gotham justice get passed to the Sons of Batman?; What is the relationship between the new commissioner and Batman-style justice going to be?; How does the next generation of superhero justice operate, with the old big names retiring and the new organizations operating under Superman's shadow?<br /><br />Part I leaves off with so much promise for Part II, but I spent the entire movie thinking, \\"WTF?\\" and waiting for a final closing thread that would pull it all together and give it some sense. Which never happend.<br /><br />Also, I'm pretty pissed that Bruce was such a dick to Alfred in the end.and give it some sense. Which never happend.<br /><br />Also, I'm pretty pissed that Bruce was such a dick to Alfred in the end.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Enjoyed another Grisham book been awhile. Slow to start but then I got hooked as usual. I would recommend this. To a friend.
B0098G7AWS|4.0|I would watch it again though, my son enjoys movies about sinking ships.  I thought that the love story was nice.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven was a quick read. Always engaging, suspenseful and carried a grand surprise. I recommend this book. Love, love, loved it.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|I buy book.  I read book.  Book make happy.  Tell friends buy book.  Borrow no good- they not bring back.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book was very captivating. A sweet romantic love story with unexpected twists and turns.  The smooth flow of the read kept my attention ready to find out more and solve the mystery, if you will. Excellent, sad, loving, enduring all at the same time.
B00785P2QC|4.0|very awesome game j really enjoy playing it on ny new kindle fire hd plus its free and there nothing like an awesome free game thanks Amazon.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|This is the most beautiful film I have ever seen. To enjoy it, though, you should go in with a questioning mind about deep subjects - the nature of man and the existence of god. If that's not for you, this movie isn't probably for you either.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I absolutely love this game it is super fun and free which for me is pretty much all of the standards I look for in a game.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I will recommend this book to my mom because reading is her hobby . I will get to play all the time . She will pay no attention to me
B0063GORYU|5.0|Like the choices in winning deals. Great to pass the time. Glad it is all one suit as I never could get the hang of using more suits.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Not for those wanting an intelligent read. Overly verbose and somewhat repetitive language. Not a bad plot and character development is there. Excellent quality overall for a fairly pornographic book. Bottom line: hot sex with enough plot and character development to keep you going through the trilogy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Ordinary Klondike version. Easy too play and helps put in time.  Good to help keep our minds sharp. Like that it turns over 1 card at a time. Never could win when using 3 card
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The graphics are incredible.  I also like the shield and boost power ups, because they help me get past many difficult obstacles while running at high speeds.  I'm able to collect a lot more coins in this version than in the first Temple Run.  I'm spending about two hours a day trying to fully unlock the abilities.  They've been helping me set a new distance record ever since I started playing.  I recommend that everyone should download this game right now.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|It is different from the tiles I had been used to so is difficult to catch all the matches. Something to pass the time.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|...and no one noticed?  My daughter loved this film; I was luke-warm on it.  Just didn't hold together as we'll as other animated film do (namely \\"Up\\" and all the \\"Toy Story\\" films.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|Daniel Pink breaks the illusion that you have to be a swift talking, fast deal making machine to succeed in sales in latest book.  In fact, he de-bunks the commonly held belief that sales is sleazy.  It is a leadership skill that Corporate America is demanding of every employee in this highly connected, social media world.  I highly recommend this book.
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|All the Vorkosigan legends manage to make an appearance in the most intriguing ways.  I highly recommend the reading of this latest adventure.<br /><br />I.A. Wilhite, Ph.D.
0763619612|5.0|Love this book!  We checked it (and its companion book: ish) out from the library so many times that I finally decided to buy our own copies.<br /><br />The child in the story is empowered by a persistent and perceptive art teacher--kudos to all the art teachers out there.  The child takes creativity to new heights and then, in the sweetest ending ever, empowers another.
B003DBOS7Y|5.0|A very touching story for young and old with a few twists.  Of the genre of On Golden Pond with wonderful music and a story line that moves along.  This one is _not_ just for the chicks.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Great story line and superb acting makes Homeland a must-see. My husband and I watched season one over a two day period. Very addicting
0307341550|4.0|I read this book after reading Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl, and really enjoyed it.  It was an engaging and fun read!
1439152802|5.0|I couldn't put this book down until I could learn what had happened to the wonderful characters that fill its pages.  It was one of those books that you can't wait to finish but that you hate to finish at the same time. The books is full of history as a lot of it takes place in 1941 in blitzed London where people live lives surrounded by bombs. At the same time, life goes on and love, happiness, friendship and flowers bloom daily for the survivors. The rest of the book is about Laurel and her siblings who are dealing with the decline due to illness of their beloved mother and a mystery that began in 1941, grew deeper in the 1960s and finalizes in 2011. I loved the book and I finished it as quickly as I could and now I am sad.
0307341577|4.0|I found this book after reading Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl, and really enjoyed it.  This story is so well crafted.  It seamlessly integrates the paths of multiple characters into an extremely compelling tale.  I'll be watching out for all her books from now on!
B00APUQH0W|4.0|Clint Eastwood does such a great job at portraying the not-so-subtle issues of aging as it relates to physical problems but even more so as it relates to catching up with one's past: Reconciliation, redemption, re-dos. Amy Adams was a worthy counterpoint and as always, fun to watch and Justin Timberlake rounded out the ensemble with spunk and warmth. We had a broad age range watching this together and all enjoyed it.
030758836X|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was well written with beautiful imagery and interesting, well-drawn characters.  Above all it was entertaining!  I couldn't put it down!
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|I like the game. the graphics are good and its fun to play. However the game is pretty much centered on the need for peanuts(currency bought by paying real money).I rather spend my money on something like paying bills than to buy peanuts to progress faster in the game. if you don't have money for this game I suggest you forget about this game or any &quot;free&quot; game from gameloft
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is hours of fun. Great app for horse lovers. Graphics are great.<br /><br />I just got started and can not wait to see where the game will go.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Get an oxygen tank, because this story will take your breath away. It is the most intensely PASSIONATE story I have had the pleasure of reading to date. You will feel it in the depths of your soul. No cheese to cut through, completely believable and hard AS HELL to put down!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game and excellent graphics! Love that this teaches responsibility and compassion and shows that with hard work through focus you can be good at anything.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I was new to this game and I am 70 and I had a lot slower reaction time so I failed a lot in the beginning but love it....don't give up
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Stupid....what was the hype about.....don't think I am gonna read the others. I have read better sex in romance novels and better all around writhing.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm a big walking dead/breaking bad fan I love these shows very much and they r definitely worth the buy
B004LWZWGA|4.0|I only gave it 4 stars though because I felt that it was lacking in some areas, and I think I even saw some errors in the movie, but they didn't make it unwatchable. So, 4 stars. I hope someone else picks up the franchise next time.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|simple, durable,protects my Kindle. Because I takeit with me no matter where I go..Very convenientto fit in your purse or backpack.
B0011UBDTK|4.0|got it as a gift for a friend of mine for her birthday because she loves the show, i was worried about some of the dvds not working as some of the other reviewers had described but she said they all have worked for her so far! only concern is that the dvds ARE in fact very tight in the casing. but over all, wasnt let down.
145470246X|5.0|Another gorgeous one for my collection.  Superb & love her neo-classical style.  Colors are well chosen and instructions are complete.  I can hardly wait to get started.
0307454568|4.0|The book is as vibrant of the other two making me want to read more and more. Lisbeth Salander is an excellent character with a very interesting and original personality.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|This is a great app!  Grand children love to play this and so do I.  Has levels for various skills.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Bought as a gift for some one who has been wanting for a long time!<br /><br />They love it!. Thank you!
B00A757EFW|3.0|Used to play this in early computer days.  This version is not a very good quality, but it Is free, so that's okay.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My opinion is that this game is the BOMB!!! An  ignore if people say this game sucks  just have fun
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I totally love this game! It's so fun to play and it has so much more detail than Temple Run and its so much more fun than the first one too! If you are having any doubts, don't! This game is sooooooo fun!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I thought the book was written well, it does repeat a lot but it's keep interesting. Love the series and maybe a book to follow the couple through life.
B00AVPYT8I|3.0|Having a somewhat difficult time sorting out how the free book app works...I ordered a book that I thought was a free book and have now been charged for it.  Not sure how that happened, but will have to work on figuring out what is free and what is not.
074356619X|5.0|I am a Christain because I can see The truth of the Bible. I recomended this to Christains because of the biblical truth it contains. It is excelent and inspiring.
B0085W09ME|2.0|Good idea and  may improve..but at this time none of the flights offered were the best available. In checking directly w/ other online agents...I was able to find better connections, times, and prices.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My daugther plays this game constantly.  This is one of the best games I have downloaded for her.  - Love it!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Read straight through, very enjoyable.  I'm sure there are detailed reviews out there, I'll leave the walls of text to them. :)
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good game overall. Could do without the &quot;energy&quot;. But you can play without having to buy anything, which is different from a lot of games.
B004NELBPC|5.0|I love to go to Huffington for a quick-fix for news on politics!  I freely admit to being a political-junkie.  Thanks to Huff Post I can keep up-to-date on my phone, iPad or notebook computer!  Also, I simply adore Sam Stein and Howard Fineman!
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|Needed this DVD to go with all the other seasons I have recommend show its great if you haven't seen then watch
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Creepy beyond words. the cast in so well developed. American Horror Story one was a home run as well. They use many of the characters from  American Horror Story one in season 2. I like to think that they were reincarnated since  American Horror Story two takes place earlier. a must see a thriller, an on the edge of seat kind of show. Check it out.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What a finally it was by far the best book I've ever read wish there was more I'll miss you katniss
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I really wanted the NIV version of the Bible, as this is the old King James version.  It is OK if you like that version.
B004EWFV9K|5.0|Very clever way to close out a series.  The author did a wonderful job of writing a novel that does not feel like an effort to just tie up loose end.  The main character's change in mental state is an interesting twist for anyone who has dealt with Alzheimer's.  A must reaad for Wallander fans, but also recommended to those who aren't familiar with the series.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|This is a musical, and both Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter (Harry Potter fame) sing through the entire story.  It is a story about revenge, but it is also rather humorous.  It is not scarey, but really absurd....lots of blood letting by the barber.  I can't stand scarey movies, but in a twisted way, giggle just remembering the songs in this movie about making people into meat pies.  Funny in a way like Monty Python and the Holy Grail was funny.  Fine for teens to adults.  Not for kids under 12.
B000067QMD|5.0|The listing doesn't specify that 6 do come in a package. YEA! They work wonders when you are storing your breastmilk right from pump to bottle. It has a tight seal to prevent any milk spilling and you can just add the nipple when ready to use for feeding. A must have for breastfeeding moms.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This is the 25th anniversary edition of the play.  Alfie Boe plays Jean Valjean, and is the best tenor in the world for this part.  One of the great wonders of the world for me is why Hugh Jackman was chosen to play the same role in the new movie....Alfie Boe's voice is so much more.  This stage play has phenominal singing in it.  At the very end, the original cast from 25 years ago comes on stage, and they all sing once again, a beautiful thing.  It is so amazing....I watched it again last night, and it once again brought me to tears.
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|Ian Rankn, creator of John Rebus, the surly, almost rude Detective Inspector in Edinborough.<br />This was a ressurection of Rebus, come out of retirement.  I suppose that was the main reason why I liked it so much.  Whether the story can be kept going with Rebus now a little past it, I do not know.<br />Ian Rankin must rate as one of the best mystery writers the UK.
B0001CCY7E|5.0|The best musical score for one of my top 5 favorite movies.  This music fills me with so much emotion.  John Barry is a genious.
B002ZG98FU|5.0|Funny captivating movie that leaves you not asking for your money back. Rachel McAdams is wonderful as is Diane Keaton and Harrison Ford. Worth your time!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i love it. it is  so much  fun!!! way better than the first one. I also like the giant monkey better than the pack that was on tr1.
0143123165|5.0|Reading this elegant and attractive book, along with the 200th anniversary of the book, has a very special effect and meaning. I am currently rereading the book, and find it more beautiful and more intimate.
B00B1OEP32|5.0|Although I wouldn't consider myself a hardcore \\"Belieber\\", I really loved this album for the most part. The simplicity of the songs really won me over and I know these aren't songs that are going to be overplayed on the radio. Overall, it's a more laid-back vibe with Justin successfully showing off his new voice. Notable favorites: Boyfriend, I Would, Nothing like Us.<br /><br />Boyfriend (5/5) - The original version of this song was already both unique and catchy, but this acoustic version brings a bluesy vibe that I really enjoy. I liked the acoustic version even more than the original.<br /><br />As Long as You Love Me (5/5) - Similar to the original, but made better by the fact that Bieber does his own rapping in this version.<br /><br />Beauty and a Beat (4/5) - Perhaps I just like his acoustic versions better, but the acoustic version of this song made it more laid back, and without Nicki Minaj's part, I'm more inclined to listen to it on repeat.<br /><br />She Don't Like the LIghts (3/5) - I didn't particularly like the original version of this song, and the acoustic version didn't sway me much in the other direction<br /><br />Take You ( 3/5) - Also not extremely notable for me.<br /><br />Be Alright (4/5) - Although this doesn't differ much from the original version, I really liked the piano background.<br /><br />All Around the world (4/5) - There's something about the acoustic that makes this song seem a lot more personal.<br /><br />Fall (Live) (4/5) - I liked the original, so I still liked the acoustic version, even though there isn't much difference between two versions.<br /><br />Yellow Raincoat (3/5) - One of the new songs on the album. Didn't stand out much for me.<br /><br />I Would (5/5) - Another new song on the album. Although this song wasn't really acoustic, it's probably my favorite song on the album. It's an upbeat song similar to Die in Your Arms.<br /><br />Nothing Like Us (5/5) - The third new song of the album and another one of my favorites. The piano background and depth in Justin's voice really makes this song stand out. It's a slower song where the lyrics really shine.rites.

B003YUC2FE|5.0|My mother in law got this for our son & he LOVES it. The case that the dvds come in is absolutely the cutest thing I have ever seen! I had the flu for 2 miserable weeks & my son watched these dvds over & over again while my hubby was at work & I was unable to move off of the couch. A true life saver. FYI, NO I don't let my son watch that much tv/movies usually but for 2wks this was what got us all through the funk =)
B009RI4FRU|4.0|We enjoyed this as much as all other Wes Anderson movies.  Big fan!  Unique fun story line, quirky and excellent cast!
0345803493|1.0|I did somewhat like the first book in the series, but Fifty Shades Darker is just a hot mess. There's no plot whatsoever - although James does try, and fail - and the sex that was steamy in the first book just gets old.<br /><br />James seems to be on auto-pilot when writing these books. Fifty Shades Darker has the phrases/scenarios below on lather, rinse, repeat:<br /><br />- Oh, my and Holy ________ (fill in the blank)<br />- My inner goddess<br />- Christian forcing Anastasia to eat ad nauseum<br />- The electricity building between them<br />- Anastasia biting her lip<br />- Sex, and more sex<br /><br />That's pretty much it. If you're read the bullet points above, you've read the entire book...
0735619670|5.0|If you want to read just one book on software development then this is the book. It has wide coverage of almost any aspects in SW starting from design to testing. Needless to say that it is based on a solid material and as any book by Steve McConnell is helpful and interesting to read.
0062127241|5.0|I have enjoyed many brilliant audiobooks, but I am currently nearing the end of what I feel is absolutely my greatest audiobook experience.  \\"Who I Am\\", Pete Townshend's memoir, read by Pete himself, is a new sensation. I am so excited by it; I won't even wait till the end of the book before sharing my praises.<br /><br />The memoir is an amazing journey through the history of rock-n-roll, vividly described from the perspective of one of its most influential artists.  I can't explain the thrill of hearing one of my musical heroes describe his creative process and reveal the inspirations behind some of the songs that became the anthems of my life.  Pete also tells wonderful, sometimes hilarious tales of the band's experiences and interactions with other rock icons providing an insight into the excess and absurdities of their lives as rock stars in the 70's.<br /><br />I cannot thank Pete enough for taking the time to produce the audio version to accompany the hardback.  It is truly a gift to his fans.  The experience is like a 10 hour conversation with a genius.  This is an absolute MUST for every Who fan and for anyone from my generation and others whose lives were influenced by the wonderful music created by Townshend and The Who.
B003Y5HWJU|4.0|Of course look at the people involved in the production - Scorsese, Mark Wahlberg... how could you go wrong? - and a surprisingly good serious acting role on Steve Buscemi's part.  I'm probably interested in this because I did not know the history of Atlantic City, and not that much about Prohibition. I think this is a good cast with good direction that keeps a good story going while learning more about that era that keeps me watching it though.
0743496736|4.0|Jodi Picoults' books always have hard-hitting topics, this one was an extremely hard topic to read knowing that such a tragic school shooting had occured a few weeks prior at an elementary school right down the road from where I grew up. I've always been intriged as to what goes through the shooter's mind, and how he/she feels it's the only option they have.<br /><br />This book gave me a new perspective. This book deals with a lot of extremely controversial issues, and I felt like I had many conflicting thoughts as I read this book, but I think that was Picoult's plan for this book, to show that in some cases the shooter is still a victim, whether it be due to bullying or hate crimes, etc. I know that is not always that case, and even if it is shouldn't result in that type of violence, but It makes you aware of what doing emotional damage to people can sometimes lead to.<br /><br />This book took me a while to get through, not because it wasn't an engrossing read, but because the subject matter at times was quite difficult, parts of this novel (although written back in 2007) felt ripped from the current headlines, and it was an emotionally taxing read that at times I had to put down for a bit to digest the information, and reflect on my thoughts and opinions on the matter. I feel like this is an important piece of literature. I myself graduated high school 10 years ago, but this was an issue back when I was in school around the time of Columbine, and this is still an issue today.<br /><br />I feel like people need to be aware that this is something that can happen anywhere, and recent events have surely proved that. I think awareness is a big part of the solution. Knowing the signs of mental illness and having stricter rules regarding bullying could really impact the actions of some teens who feel like revenge is the only way to conquer their hurt. Jodi Picoult wrote a very-well crafted story that is so raw and emotional, it's not an easy read, but something I feel is very important.is very important.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Much like the circus in the story, the book has a palpable feel of mystery and romance that is beautiful and enchanting. Can't wait to read this again.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|We enjoyed the movie so much the first time when rented, I bought one.  While watching this movie about a few British retirees taking an extended trip to India for various reasons, I often found myself comparing my own life after retirement with the characters in the movie.  I don't see myself living in India, however we did move out-of-state after retirement--our own little adventure.<br /><br />This movie struck a chord with us somehow to open new doors after retirement and live life to the fullest.  This movie is inspirational and will make you smile.
B002SVBDYQ|5.0|No matter if you're a Twilight fan or not, this is a great album. Each song has a special place in my heart.
B009VB7QQA|3.0|It was a fun watch. I don't know if it's something I'd recommend to everyone, but I enjoyed it. The cast is impressive and the production value was better than expected. The sorry line is quite cheesy though.. And the dialog is less than obvious.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|Great and great and great and great and great and great and great and great and great and great! Did I mention it was GREAT!?
B00B2V66VS|1.0|The app is not the best it has so many it does not even work right.  It is even harder than the first if I was you stick with the first one.
B000002VSN|4.0|I like soundtracks. I bought this for one single song, but I ended up enjoying the entire album. I recommend if you like Whitney.
B009A9EQL6|2.0|Aerosmith blow my mind twenty years ago,they were my favorite band.<br />Now ,i don't like very much the music they play.<br />I waiting for the second coming but ,is not this album.
B00AR1G3FS|4.0|I have both the DVD and HD DVD versions of this concert. This review is of the HD DVD version, back in the day when HD DVD had not given up yet. Content wise, its 5 stars out of 5. All of the songs, and more, that I loved and grew up with are in the set list. Video, given its limitations, is excellent for a concert video. BTW, the aspect ratio is actually 16:9 (1.78:1). As far as the audio, you have a choice of DTS 5.1 Surround and 2-channel stereo. So your Lossless Audio option is limited to the stereo PCM Audio being DTS 5.1 a Lossy audio, to my disappointment. The producers could have included a lossless version. And this explains why I gave it only 4 stars. To my ears (I am not gifted with Golden Ears), the audio is excellent. I prefer the DTS surround option as it provides a more enveloping 'you are there' surround experience. And this experience was through my old HDMI-less AV receiver, the Yamaha RX-V1. However, when I changed to a newer HDMI-equipped receiver, the Yamaha Aventage A800 AV receiver, a strange thing happened. The DTS 5.1 Surround track when played through HDMI is recognised by my new receiver as DTS HD-Master Audio. And there is indeed a perceived improvement in the quality of the audio. So I am happy. I hope the Blu-ray version will finally include the Lossless DTS-HD Master Audio to justify the purchase/double dip for those fans who already have the earlier HD DVD release. I was fortunate to have seen and heard them performed live in 2008. They opened the Verizon Wireless Amphitheater here in Alpharetta, Georgia. The sound is perfect. Just like the studio-recorded versions. Highly recommended!

B00B2V66VS|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game. I have it on both my phone (Samsung Galaxy 3) &amp; Kindle Fire HD. The only problem is that when I want to stop playing, it won't exit. It is a problem on both my devices. I have to press the &quot;home&quot; button to go to the home screen, then go to the application manager to &quot;force close&quot; the app so it won't keep running in the background and drain my battery. Please fix this!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|What a sad life for two people, but good comes to those who wait.  A great and easy read, I would love to see a sequel.

B008OURHPY|5.0|A friend recommended her album and after hearing one sample I had to have the whole album.  La Havas has a beautiful control of her voice.  Her arrangements are powerful, graceful, and unexpected.  Excellent!

B003UYUQZW|5.0|It was fast timing, great service, all went super, I would surely reorder from this vender, happy with overall order
B004QK5N5W|5.0|Not sure why everyone says it doesn't work.<br /><br />I mainly used this on my iPhone 4s for mirroring the screen and also for watching movies in hotel rooms on trips.<br /><br />I have also used this on verison 1 iPad.  It won't mirror the screen until you jailbreak it, which I did.  It does play movies though without jailbreaking.<br /><br />Great way to watch movies on the TV and charge your phone.<br /><br />Only complaint is that the connection is larger then a normal power cable.  See picture I posted.  So you might have to take your case off to use.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I love this show, I wish more people were watching it because it would breed other shows like it. Please do yourself a favor and watch it.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Never heard of the group until a friend sent me a link to &#34;It's Time&#34; and since then I was hooked.  Finally downloaded the whole album and I really enjoy every song.  Unique sound, great beats, and motivating music.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so much fun and incredibly interactive. A great game for all ages, in my opinion. It takes no time at all to get in to playing it.

B00ABGEFWC|3.0|I think this app is AMAZING. But I hate the fact that it is so expensive!! SERIOUSLY, $100 dollars just for 20000 gems?!?! So unfair!!  The person who made this is AWFUL at making payment decisions&hellip; If you don't want to spend money on overpriced things, I suggest you dint get this app&hellip;
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This up does what it claims. I like that I can personalize it to fit my needs. Sometimes more white noise is needed than other times-
B004L9MFM2|4.0|Like many others I loved the first novel but I feel this one falls short. I still enjoy the read but I skim much of the, what I think, is unecessary descriptive and long winded text. I still love the characters and the plot and look forward to picking it up every night.
B005NKGEP2|2.0|The storyline is credible and interesting, but the characters are not. The main character is shallow, her professional background doesn't match her character and her actions aren't believable. The other characters aren't much better. I kept going just to find out how the storyline played out, but gave up and stopped reading halfway through the book.
0199573204|5.0|I put Marcus Aurelius (Meditations), Solomon (Ecclesiastes), Max Ehrmann (Desiderata), and probably the stoics (except I haven't read any of them) in the category of how to be realistic in the present circumstances. But there's more than just what's \\"under the sun\\". Rick Larson (The Star of Bethlehem) waxes poetic towards the end of his DVD. It seems anyone who has glimpsed the gist of the New Testament sees it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Best game ever. Fast download and really fun to play. Kind of addicting for all age, even my grandma plays it
1457514508|4.0|Gordonston, a quiet neighborhood in Savannah, seems like the ideal place to live - a place where all the neighbors get together to mourn the loss of another neighbor and to walk their dogs (and to sip their cocktails).  Their only concern seems to be the culprit who refuses to \\"scoop\\" after walking his dog.  But all is not how it seems in Gordonston and many of the people living there have secrets they don't want anyone to find out.  Little do they know that one of those secrets will cost someone their life.<br /><br />While it starts off slowly and at times could use an editor, towards the middle of the book \\"The  Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club\\" becomes an exciting, page turning book full of surprises.  What makes the book so interesting and work so well are the various characters, all of whom have secrets, many of them deadly.  None of the characters are who they seem to be anD author Duncan Whitehead does a good job of creating some real twists that will catch the reader by surprise.  Every minor character in the book is important - even a seemingly innocent older gentleman in Argentina.  Whitehead takes his time unveiling the surprises, slowly building up suspense until towards the end of the book where the action really picks up and the surprises begin.  Another thing that Whitehead does well is the first chapter that hints at something sinister underneath the surface in Gordonston - it is a nice way to draw readers into the story and Whitehead ties it up neatly in the end.<br /><br />\\"The  Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club\\" turned out to be a much better and more interesting book than I thought when I first started reading it - well done!<br /><br />Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book for free. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own.

B003CNQPNS|3.0|I must say I like this show, and I can see how it has retained it's value: i.e. it costs as much as a new show, but the disks are another matter altogether. I have a brand new (this year) Toshiba laptop with a DVD/BLURAY player. These disks will not play in it at all. Don't get me wrong, I have older disks such as the complete X-Files series that play fine. Even so old, cheaply made disks with old shows like Jack Benny play fine. These do not. Fortunately, they play in my regular DVD player attached to my TV. But it is aggravating not to be able to watch them here on my laptop. Blast!<br /><br />Quoth the Raven...
B0053KWDES|5.0|Well made portable amp makes my Grados sing! I have it matched up to my Zen-X-Fi(The only thing that Creative Labs got right on their Zens was the sound) I also use it with the Zen matched up to my Logitech S715i when I have it on battery power. The amp is well made and has nice battery life. Comes with everything you need right out of the box!

B00AREIAI8|5.0|its very addicting and real live like. we got it for our daughter and now we all play along. I would recommend this to anyone with school aged children. its like having your own horse.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I really like this game. The only problem I have with it is that it occasionally crashes when you die and use a gem to save yourself. Though other than that bug I love it. It's very addicting and fun. Once you break a million points it gets very intense and fun.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Solitaire is all it plays.  I saw a lot of reviews that commented on the ads each time you start a new game.  I was a little surprised that they would allow &#34;adult&#34; advertising on a game like this.
B008745B32|2.0|Undoubtedly, Waugh is a good writer. I found the subject matter of this novel terribly boring, the main characters strange and uninteresting.  I had absolutely nothing in common with any of the characters  so I could not make any connection with them and did not care what happened to them.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I was injoying the game a lot on till it reset itself and then when I died it would just sit there so when you exit and go Bk in u start all over again I was soooo mad.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was so impressed by his book.  I have just started reading more scifi books and after this series I will continue to do so.  I just got done reading the enders game series and I was disappointed with all but the first book.  I was afraid this would be the same way but it was so cheap I figured why not.  Well I am glad I did.  The first book was short but still awesome and got me hooked.  I thought all the others where just as good.  I just bought part six of this series and and cant wait to read more.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|It sometimes gets bogged down, but most of the time the story moves along. It gets a bit techy on a few subjects and it appears that some of the science may be a bit stretched. However; this was an easy read that kept me interested and wanting to find out what happens. It also has some good black humour.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Mockingjay finalizes the true effects of the Hunger Games.  How each person is traumatized from loss and fright and it is the hardest book on the reader. A must to finish the series.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks.  Also like to read the novel before the movie comes out.  Can't wait till it comes out in February.
B00B780TAK|5.0|Beautiful story, beautiful cinematography. Takes you back to those times in a modern way. While certain values are beautiful, the class distinctions are so rigid. Unrequited love between Matthew and Mary keeps you watching and hoping and anticipating. Nicely done!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I rented this movie with my husband as just a (free rental) comedy for a Monday night, but it is EVEN better than I ever expected. The puke is gross (but symbolic and a LITTLE funny), and it doesn't overshadow all the music, performances, dancing, and acting. If you like music and girls or boys, this movie is a must see. I don't comment on much, but I am on here to purchase this movie (and probably the soundtrack)so I decided to share how much I STILL love this movie after i have watched it a TON of times in the last two days!!! I can't wait until my daughter is old enough to watch this with me! GREAT music and a FUN movie!
B0010SKTRA|5.0|Very stimulating and knowledgeable. Short and competent synthesis of the most recent scholarship in the evolution of our animal ancestors.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I think it is the real story rather than what we were told by the New Media.  I do think people watch to much TV and the way Hollywood presents a story.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I love the John Corey character and appreciate his humor,  it was overdone in the Panther.  I look forward to another DeMille book with Corey at the center but with more focus on the story and less on the wise cracks.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Nice app to have in your drawer. This is a lot of fun to play appropriate or inappropriate sounds in different situations.
B007BFSYMS|3.0|Kind of expensive, a little pushy, and hasn't helped me get to sleep. helps during homework sometimes I guess if I want to listen to something but don't want to be distracted by music. Anyways, if you get it you probably wont have very strong feelings for or against it. just a two dollar meh...alright.
B0042KZJ5K|4.0|Great Little Album... I Will Buy Again!!! This Looks Nice and Look Like Well Constructed =) ALTHOUGH... the second CD is the same as the first just in different orders so unless this is priced cheaper then the single disk there is NO reason to spend more to get this one...
0062225715|5.0|Mort is the book to read if you're interested in Death. It is the first of the Discworld books in the Death story arc and contains the most information about him and his world.<br /><br />Mort is a bungling young man who cannot get apprenticed to anyone. At midnight, Death shows up to make him his apprentice. He is taken to Death's world, meets Death's adopted daughter Ysabell and his manservant Albert, and learns the trade.<br /><br />One of the themes of this book, and which is a theme running through other Discworld books as well, is the tension between fate and human initiative, or Fate and the Lady, if you like, though the gods do not really show up in this book. Someone is meant to die, but Mort does not think it's fair, so he interferes, and messes up the whole fabric of reality, though everything rights itself in the end. The end is a bit contrived, but this is still a good book. The theme of the conflict between Fate and the Lady is sometimes handled awkwardly in the Discworld series.<br /><br />Mort is one of the more dramatic of the Discworld books. It is not just light-hearted whimsy all the time, like some others. It feels a bit more heavy, which is a good thing in my book. My only problem with it is that the sexual jokes are a bit heavier in this book than in other Discworld books, which I don't like.<br /><br />Death has always been my favorite character in the Discworld series. Now I have finally found the book that he shows up most in, so I am satisfied. I have some parts of this book memorized, it is so good.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|But divine joy is the true blazing Reality. Before it , earthly joys are but shadows ! Faith is the Greatest virtue :)
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I'm glad to have finally had the chance to pick up a copy of Reflected in You, the second book in Day's Crossfire series.  I guiltily devoured the first book, and enjoyed this one even more.  This book picks up where the first left off - Eva and Gideon have been together for about a month.  Their physical passion for each other has not dwindled a bit, and they continue to obsess over the perfection of the other while simultaneously hating themselves.<br /><br />Gideon and Eva have an extremely fragile, overwhelming, all-consuming relationship.  Despite the unhealthy nature of it all, I really did root for them to overcome their insecurities and find peace with each other.  The way Day wrote these characters, it made me want that for them.<br /><br />I couldn't put this book down. Day's writing is so breezy and easy to read; however, don't think that this means there's no substance.  There are some very beautiful passages here (I loved every mention of New York City - great imagery).<br /><br />There were a few details that tripped me up over the course of the novel, and I don't feel like they were fully explained at the end (unless I missed something).  I was surprised by the turn the story took and it's an understatement to say I'm excited to read the third installation of the Crossfire series when it's released.  I don't know what I'll possibly read to hold me over!
0385535147|4.0|It is really hard to rate this novel, because I experienced different feelings while reading it and the variance was wide. It started out pretty interesting, with the main character, Malcolm, telling us the story of why he is in prison and we soon find out he has some knowledge that can help him get out early in exchange for information on the murder of a federal judge. The set up definitely gave me high hopes for this to be a great book.<br /><br />Then things started going a little awry, since the story slowed down and I felt like Grisham was actually repeating himself in order to make the novel longer. Every other chapter we would get an introduction that once again goes over the process by which Malcolm was going to get out of prison. I understand that it's the character's own narration, and this may have been occupying his thoughts, but do we really need to read this over and over?<br /><br />Luckily, right before the middle of the book, things picked up considerably and I could not put the book down until I was done. There were some holes in the story line, and some of the logic is twisted to say the least, but I cannot deny that it is entertaining. I usually hate when authors use an unreliable narrator, and in this case there are plenty of indications that the description may apply to this book. But even with that fact hanging over my head, I have to say that the final result was mostly satisfying. Whether the narrator was really unreliable or not, you will have to find out for yourself, and there are also plenty of twists and turns for you to try to figure out.
B006LSZECO|4.0|An extreme example of a functioning sociopath & the punishment that she creates for her cheating husband whom is ultimately & unknowingly addicted to her.

B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I enjoyed the game.  I needed to use the hints to move around but it did not take away from the fun of it. The mini games were challenging but not to difficult, I would like to see more games like this.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Fun game. Well worth the 2.99. I don't agree w/the reviews saying it's to short. I think I would have burned out if it was any longer. It was just right.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is very very fun there's a mine and in the mine you get to ride in a cart buy this app.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|His most linguistically sophisticated novel yet. Lots of great action and moral quandaries solved messily. I've read all his other novels and would suggest starting there, since Red Country, although I would imagine solid as a stand along, has quite a few great payoffs that would only be apparent to someone who's read The First Law Trilogy, Best Served Cold and The Heroes. Easily the best new fantasy novel I've read in a long time.
B0097GVJWQ|3.0|this is a fun game with good graphics. and story line. but I got very tired of going from one end for one task then having to return to the other end of the game over and over for just one task.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is fun and it has much more in it everyone should love this game because there is more to it. then the first one so little kids to grown adults would enjoy it.
B008KO8KZ0|1.0|The description says RIM Compatible, but when I converted to bar and installed it , it immediately crashes.  Doesn't work on Playbook 2.1.  Need to change RIM compatibility to X.

B0070Y46UY|4.0|It is an extraordinary story that is quite vivid in descriptions for all the senses.  It does a masterful job of putting you there.  The ending was a little anticlimactic but overall a very good story.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|it needs more time because if u want more people installing u might as well get more people occupied..I HATE it when I'm really into a demo of the game then it stops cuz yo time up and I don't wanna buy ot but I wanna play it.

0547848412|4.0|Life of Pi is the story of a young boy who grew up in Pondicherry, India. He tells you how he got the name Piscine Molitor Patel and why he has dreaded his name in school. He tells you about his family. There is his father, his mother, and his brother. Pi tells you of his father's work, which is running a zoo, and tells you about life growing up around a zoo. He tells you of most of the animals the zoo consists of and tells you of the animal's behaviors. Growing up, Pi has struggled with his identity issues and his religious views. He becomes apart of Catholic, Hindu, and Muslim faiths. All of these religious intakes can be very overwhelming which makes Pi question his life. Later on in the book Pi and his family decide to move to Canada. They take a Japanese ship to Northern America that will allow the Patel's and the zoo animals aboard the ship. Unfortunately, a storm occurs at sea causing the ship to sink and Pi to be the only human survivor.<br />  Pi is now stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean with an injured zebra, an orangutan, and a hyena. On the life boat, Pi tries to handle the situation he has now been thrown into. Pi still keeps faith in the hopes that his family is still alive and stranded at sea just like him. During his time on the boat the hyena starts to attack the injured zebra. The hyena viciously begins to eat the zebra while it is still alive. Pi is obviously horrified by this spectacle but is not entirely surprised. Pi tries to keep his distance from the hyena so he can survive. Later on the orangutan and the hyena have a confrontation. This later on leads to the hyena attacking, killing, and eating the orangutan. This leaves only one other being the hyena can eat, Pi. The hyena starts to make its way to Pi until, out of no where, comes out Richard Parker. Richard Parker is a Bengal tiger that the zoo had possession of when it was a cub. Pi is grateful but then shortly afterwards comes to realize he is now at a higher risk because of Richard Parker. Pi tries to keep his distance between Richard Parker and himself. Pi then finds supplies and food to keep him alive while at sea.<br />  During this adventure of a young boy and a Bengal tiger, Pi tries to hold onto faith and the hopes to survive. This story is truly compelling in every way possible. This book makes you feel as if you were stranded in the middle of the ocean with no one but a carnivorous tiger. Life of Pi causes you to question any and every religion you had ever read upon. It makes you question your relationship with God whether you have one or not. This book is written with such a force that it can make you believe in God.
0316066524|1.0|I tolerated \\"Infinite Jest\\" through the first hour and twelve minutes of the audiobook. It's written in the first-person from the point of view of a mentally ill teenager. The first chapter is about the teenager having a psychotic attack during a college admissions interview. The second chapter is about the narrator trying to buy drugs. Or, rather, the narrator obsessively thinking about trying to buy drugs. He doesn't do anything. It's just the narrator's interior thoughts about trying to buy drugs. This chapter was painful to listen to. I'd give the first chapter a star for vocabulary, but the second chapter is so bad that I'm taking away the second star. The narrator shows no insight into his mental illness, i.e., he never admits that he has a mental illness, even after he's taken to a psychiatric hospital. I realize that this book is considered to be \\"literature\\" but IMHO the internal ravings of mentally ill people isn't literature.<br /><br />I've read some of the reviews that say that Wallace was a \\"genius\\" and the book is full of \\"beautifully constructed characters.\\" These reviews bear no resemblance to the part of the book I read. What I read would have gotten an F in a freshman writing class.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I always seem to have some series going that I'm fascinated with and Downton Abbey is it right now.  While waiting for True Blood to come back on, I took a turn toward a period show for a change of pace and am hooked.  My husband and I watched 2 1/2 seasons in about two days while home sick with the flu.  Now we anxiously await Sunday nights to see what's going on.  Love the time period, the sense of honor this generation had, and the respect they have for family and dignity.  No shooting, swearing, car chases etc. but lots of drama and character development.  Love it.
B0099Y2YL6|2.0|Subtitles are WAY TOO SMALL!!! The subtitles are much smaller than that on the season 1 & 2 special edition set I bought -- even smaller than the ones on the regular TV. It seems ridiculous to spend money on something that I cannot use!
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|One of the best kids movies we've seen all year my son LOVES it and quotes it repeatedly, I also thought it had enough secret adult humor to keep parents entertained.

B0071CNGI8|5.0|This story is very well written and put you into the horses view of everything that is happening around him. Lots of ups and downs as he has to participate in World War I. The horse has roles to play in both sides of the war showing you the perspective that those fighting the war are finding it to be a very grueling things to be a part of.

B00AO2P3GA|4.0|This game is good for the money, figuring it is being played on a kindle fire. The controls are slightly awkward at first but after a few hours you will get the hang of it. The graphics are reasonably good for a portable game on a tablet. The story line so far ok.....

B00APUYWYA|5.0|Funny, quirky, quite funny, interesting. Maybe throw in slightly suspenseful. A bit of an easily guessed ending, but completely worth the money. I'm positive you'll love it.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  Excited to begin the next to book, to see how the story continues.  Looking forward to the movie also
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Well the app is amazing but I wonder where my coins go. But the rest is okay!Hey I still love it!
B005DOL0R0|4.0|Only drawback is zipping/unzipping. Flipping open might be nicer but this way may protect better. All in all it's good.
B004TMPJP6|4.0|Wunderlist allows you to create a list of any number of tasks & put a date on each of the task.  You can then place them in the order you wish.  You can check them off as they are completed or just delete them.  It supposed to be able to sync with your computer & other devices that you may have.  I have not got this to work yet, however.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is brilliant so far, although I haven't come across the paid elements yet. I think that this game is good for teaching kids about horses, not enough people ride these days which is a shame, it was the highlight of my childhood!
B007FIY3VW|5.0|This software is cheap and easy to use. Though some bugs inside, i still love the ui design and functionality. No worse than Quickoffice in some means.

B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Why didn't I do this when I had a chance 40 years ago?  Now my knees (and other parts) are 40 years older and not likely to take me on such a journey...a missed opportunity!  Cheers to Cheryl!!
B0042X9L6A|5.0|Great flash.  Very easy to use.  I have used a few times in public and taking photos of flowers and it works great.  Very good flash that provides great results.  Don't buy the high end Nikon flash units if you are just in need of extra light as an amateur photographer.  This will give you all the flash lighting you will need.
0452287022|4.0|This story is set back in the 1660s in Holland. The main character is a girl named Griet. Griet's father has become blind from an accident in his tile factory. With no income for the family, Griet must work as a maid. Her master is to be the famous painter, Johannes Vermeer, and she is to clean his studio. She leaves to go work at her new house. It is very hard for her to adapt to a maid's life but she learns quickly. After a few months of working at the house as a maid, she is allowed to clean her master's studio. His wife must open the door to the studio but she is never allowed in which upsets her a lot.  But there's one problem, she must clean his room without moving anything. She takes up the challenge. Griet measures every little piece of furniture in relation to one another , then picks it up, cleans the spot, then sets it down in exactly the same spot where she measured it. It goes on like this every day. When she Tanneke (the other maid) finally take her to go grocery shopping with her, the butler's son sees her and falls in love with her. Almost every time Griet goes to the butcher shop he is there. He begins to show up to church and introduces himself to Griet's parents. He keeps asking her for her hand in marriage but she says she is too young. Her master has finished the painting he has worked on and Van Ruijven comes to pick up the painting. He takes notice of Griet and she is haunted by the way he looked at her. She sees him again at more events the family hosts like a feast for a new born baby, and holiday parties. Each time he notices her and touches her a few times. He declares at one dinner that he wants a painting of her with him in it to. But her master does not want to paint her with him. Last time Van Ruijen got painted with a maid, he got her drunk and then slept with her at night. Griet is scared of her master's decision because she knows they cannot afford to offend Van Ruijen.<br />I really liked this book. At first it didn't seem like aninteresting book, but the further you read the more enticing and interesting it became. One of my favorite parts is that she keeps her hair hidden in her caps and never reveals it to anyone except for two times, which are pretty surprising. She keeps saying that a women like her shouldn't have her  hair out because she doesn't want attention. My other favorite part in the story is when you find out that her master has actually agreed to paint her but on on circumstance. What I also like about this book is the author's style. She is very descriptive in her words and doesn't rush through the story when she writes it. I would recommend this book to others because this book takes you through an artistic person point of view and has some suspense  towards the end. It  is and easy read and can widen your the point of view that you see things from.
B003WUYRGI|3.0|Purchased by mistake --MY KENDAL is new and I am sure I will make more mistake s along the way.  I WAS .NOT AWARE that  is a requirement to review each book and  will certainly be more careful.
0345803507|5.0|My wife read these books.  All three of them. Holy Mackeral Andy!!!  Throw away the Viagra!  She was all over me like a wet tee shirt for months.  I guess she liked them.  She told all her friends though that that they were perverted and she just skimmed them and decided they weren't for her. HAH!!!!
B003ODIZL6|3.0|I choose their rating because I never used the dictionary and it was only taking up space.  Another mistake made by a new user, I will be mindful about what I download, in the future.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Great read. Once I started it was difficult for me to put it down. I can wait to read the next book. Set in a different time and a different place. I love traveling back in time when I read. Amazing
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|My first Blu Ray. Loved this movie and the special features. The quality was great. The digital option for iTunes download is also great quality. Hard to see the difference in quality from the disk and the UltraViolet version streamed.
B00B70SDXS|5.0|WHEN IS THE NEXT EPISODE COMING OUT?  I NEED TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO THE BROTHERS.  I WANT TO KNOW IF THE GOVERNER GETS EATEN BY ZOMBIES. EXCUSE ME FOR SHOUTING
B004V5A7K8|3.0|NO REPLAYS! NO CONTINUES! ONE LIFE AND YOUR DEAD! AND IT DOESN'T HAVE A PASSWORD SYSTEM! (Grumble grumble grumble). Otherwise, classic breakout.<br /><br />Get used to the first few levels. You'll be seeing them a lot.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|The Holy Bible is fiction. There is no God, and even if there was, who would want to warship THIS one. There is no Jesus. This fiction book is a waste of your time, and not worth reading even purely for entertainment.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Funny, silly, and cute. Very nice to have a 'non Princess' heroine for little girls.  Pixar does a nice job.
B00797MB0O|5.0|The moral is something like this: Those born with a silver spoon or good looks can have an even harder time adjusting to adult life. Each of us must make peace with adult realities or be stuck in childhood fantasies of being unique, special and entitled to greatness. Most of us have some turning point where we grow up and drop all of the aforementioned fantasies, some of us take a little longer, and some of us never make it out of the \\"life owes me greatness\\" fantasies. This is the story of a woman struggling to let go of the fantasy and grow up.<br /><br />The writing and acting are top-notch. If you want something simpler or more predictable, you might want to look elsewhere.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|Occasionally funny but mostly just crude.  General plot of the movie was stupid to begin with and vulgarity and nudity don't help.
B0046ECFRM|3.0|N ice and easy going ... quick and cute obviously not the best thing ever but good . Overall worth price
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Original, well-thought out plot with a great cast.  I really enjoyed this movie and would definitely watch it again sometime.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|Been a huge fan of Tegan and Sara for a while, and saw them open for The Killers. This album will not disappoint. It is full of truth, hurt and love. Heartthrob is such a perfect description. I think it is a magnificent album, I haven't stopped listening to in since I purchased it. Buy it. Love it. It is amazing.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|All the Batman movies are amazing and this one is great without being quite as dark as the previous movies. Definitely watch over and over.
B004LWZW42|4.0|Think about it:  &#34;Mutants&#34;...people with &#34;Strange Gifts & Talents&#34; is it possible?  Could these people exist now or in the future?  What would &#34;the world&#34; do about it?
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Great for kids and for adults. We watched this as a family movie night--all were equally entertained! Worth your time!
B004LWZW8I|4.0|This movie is grisly, very violent.  But, see beneath to the deeper spiritual messages.  Plus, you can see how God is and how He is not!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really liked this app because I really like horses. Most horse apps have very bad looking horses and they don't let you play with the horse. This game does much more.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I personally think that you should get this game it is soooo fun and addicting like the comment on top the graphics are amazing and their is sooooo much to do like a zip line and Cole min diamond mine and forest spike wheels and sooooo much more
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is great for all ages. my daughter who is two has fun with it. I could play it for hours
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I thought this was a fantastic book! Very inspiring, yet showing you the dangers in our world. I loved how it teaches to reach out God when you need him and not just give up..
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple  run 2 has been a blast it have ziplines. Cave and more I would  buy. This game if  I were you
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It was a wonderful tale that entertained me as much as any marvelous fairy tale I have read before.  It was like The Arabian Nights.
1451695195|3.0|Why the big publisher?  Do you know how expensive and connected you have to be to have them even interested in what you have to say?  The average and truly inspired person would have had to self-publish.  Although one would be unfair to say that Dr. Alexander had not had this experience and that what happened to him was to him real, he lacked connection and emotion with his reader.<br /><br />I, for one, believe that to see through the glass darkly, yet someday face to face, is the necesary part of having FAITH.  Heaven help us, if we had proof.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I LOVE this game except I think my most fav game is txt now so I think u should get both games there both free :)
0061655554|5.0|This is a great story.  Walsh College, a business school in Michigan, included it as required reading in a finance course I took -- the school is known for having students read some present day classic material -- and it was present day when I read it. It's good, brings to light the greed and excess so common in corporate boardrooms of the 80s --- and into the 90s...and does it so well.<br /><br />It's a great read.
B009VB7QQA|5.0|This was an unexpected blast. What a twisted play on history. Fun and funny. Who would have guess Abe was a vampire killer?
B008673ZAQ|5.0|\\"Great Read.  I devoured it.  Going onto book three next. I didn't think they would make it till the end. I didn't't want it to end.
B007JGAR6U|4.0|Great, convenient size with adequate power for 90% of scenarios.  I knew ahead of time that it did not have tilt or bounce, but you can work around this by using a Canon off-shoe cable.  Unfortunately, there are two cons: (a) since it uses AAA batteries, don't expect rapid flash recycle after using the flash and (b) when the flash goes into hibernation mode after being idle for a few seconds, the TTL seems to lose the connectivity so you have to turn both the flash and the camera off and or to reestablish the link.  Unfortunately, the EF-42 is too big in portion to the X-Pro 1 or the X-E1 for that matter.  Hopefully, Fujifilm can fix con (b) with a firmware update.
B0030B624E|5.0|I saw this movie originally when it was released on dvd, but wanted to go back and see it again. I was not disappointed! It's just a fun 'romp' and a great take on the Zombie apocalypse. The entire cast works well together, and it's just a fun movie to watch.
B00006879E|5.0|Really enjoy their music. Can understand the lyric of this group and the music turns out to be very enjoyable to listen to.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is so well detailed I felt like I was in the scene,<br /> even though the movie is an embarrassment to the franchise this book is still perfect and unlike any other book
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|If you saw any of the trailer then you saw the funniest parts of the movie... Should not be discribed as a comedy
B006LSZECO|3.0|I enjoyed the book very much.  Ms. Flynn is an excellent writer.  Nevertheless, I was a little disappointed with ending.  I would, however, recomend the book.
B0060QM09M|5.0|It was great!  The situations James got into really did seem like something that could only happen in movies or TV, but it was real life, which made it all the more captivating!

B003HYNB34|3.0|This season is ok but not great. Matt Smith is ok but nothing speacial. I do like his Lighthearted approch to the role of the Doctor, but he shows none of the vulnerability,sadness or lonileness of the last of the Time Lords. Amy is ok but she treats Rory badly ,this is man who waited 2000 years watching over her. I do like the interaction between the Doctor and Rory, their is friendship, respect, and fear by Rory of the Doctor \\" how he makes his companions react to danger to impress the Doctor\\". I think the writing is not as good as it was with Doctor # 10, the whole ideal of a crack in time was silly and did not make a whole lot of sense. Most of the episodes in this season won't werth watching except for episodes 1,4,5,12,13. I do love River Song, the interaction btween her and the Doctor is great,the flirting,banter, and suspensions of the Doctor about who and what River is to him is wonderfull.

B003YUBXRM|5.0|Alex Rider's back in this action packed book. I love this one because it reveals a lot of his background while maintaining all the action of the books.
B0000AGQ6Y|5.0|This DVD is the Euro Version which has missing footage from the USA version.<br /><br />It is amazingly clear as well this extra bit thing is impressive.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abby is a great story that keeps you engrossed every episode. The characters are so well played that you will feel like you know them.
B000002L42|5.0|This is awesome, reminds me of the live show I saw just a few years back. Particularly, I am fond of Reelin' & Aja. Oh, and also this: Donald Fagen, I am in love with you.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I laughed.  I cried.  I laughingly cried.  The writing blew me away!  This is not a book about cancer; it is an awesome-top-of-the-list book with cancer in it.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|I was looking forward to reading 11/22/63. I started reading and I could not put it down,but mid way it seemed to become muddled and it seemed like a chore to finish it.  A lot of the book seemed to border on ( I dont even know the words to use to describe it),why would an accomplished author put passages in his book, having the character say,He needed maxi pads to cough up blood in and this menustration of the mouth is murder.  I think Stephen King is a genius and I have always enjoyed his books, but this one was a good idea that went south.
0307352145|5.0|Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking is a well researched, fascinating book by Susan Cain (herself an introvert).<br /><br />Did you know that up to half of all people you know are introverts?<br /><br />  \\"If you're not an introvert yourself, you are surely raising, managing, married to, or coupled with one.\\"<br /><br />When you think of an introvert, you may think of the wallflower, the shy person, the one who doesn't like to be around people and would rather interact with a computer than a person.  But introverts aren't necessarily shy, they just need to recharge with alone time, while we extroverts need to recharge by being around people.<br /><br />  \\"The single most important aspect of personality...is where we fall on the introvert-extrovert spectrum. Our place on this continuum influences our choice of friends and mates, and how we make conversation, resolve differences, and show love. It affects the careers we choose and whether or not we succeed at them.\\"<br /><br />Many introverts are \\"highly sensitive\\". 70% of highly sensitive people are introverts. Cain interviews Elaine Aron, an expert on highly sensitive people, and spends some time at a retreat for the highly sensitive.<br /><br />Homeschoolers will be interested to learn that the obsession with the dreaded \\"S\\" word, socialization, seems to stem from the 20's, when psychologists started warning about the \\"dangers\\" of shyness. By mid-century, parents were discouraging their children from hobbies that would be deemed \\"unpopular\\".  It's also interesting to note cultural differences - with some cultures, such as China, celebrating the introvert, while our western culture celebrates the extrovert.<br /><br />If you're a parent, you will especially find the chapter, \\"On Cobblers and Generals: How to Cultivate Quiet Kids in a World That Can't Hear Them\\". Cain shares real stories of parents and children. And she shares something that I've always practised with my so-called \\"shy\\"child:<br /><br />  \\"...don't let her hear you call her \\"shy\\": she'll believe the label and experience her nervousness as a fixed trait rather than an emotion she can control. She also knows full well that \\"shy\\" is a negative word in our society. Above all, do not shame her for her shyness.\\"<br /><br />So are you an introvert or an extrovert?  If you don't already know, or aren't sure, there is a 20 question quiz included in the pages of Quiet. And guess what, you may even be an ambivert - there actually is such a thing.<br /><br />This book is a must-read for both introverts and extroverts. Introverts and extroverts alike can learn not only about themselves, but their friends and loved ones. I understand my family just a little bit better now.

0064400557|5.0|White, E.B., Charlotte's Web. (1974). New York, New York: Harper Collins Publishers.<br />Genre: Fiction  Chapter Book<br />Grade Level(s): Second and up  Content Area(s): The Life of Fran, Wilbur and Charlotte<br /><br />Child Read<br /><br />Author, E.B. White, and pictures by Garth Williams, have created a work that would become a masterpiece for many years to come. The story is told through a child's point of view, which makes it easier for elementary student's to relate too. An exciting chain of events will help young reader's become intrigued. The main character's name is Fern. Fern and her family live on a farm.There are many points to the story, some of them are responsibility, friendship, working together and having a positive attitude.<br /><br />Fern is on a rescue to help save the runt of newest litter of pigs. Up early in the morning, Fern begs her father to give the baby pig a chance. Mr. Zukerman, Fern's father agrees that Fern can take care of the tiny runt and this all happened before breakfast! Fern decides to call the pig, Wilbur. Wilbur and Fern become fast friends Wilbur and Fern, become the best of friends. Fern diligently cares for Wilbur, until the time comes to sell him. Fern pleads once again. Fair time came as it did every year, but this year was different, because Wilbur was there. Templeton, Charlotte and Wilbur work together to overcome many problems.<br /><br />The pictures included are few, but they help depict an image of what is going on. The pictures look to be hand drawn and accurately describe the story.<br /><br />3.SL.4 ` Report on a topic or text, tell a story, or recount an experience with appropriate facts and relevant, descriptive details, speaking clearly at an understandable pace.\\"<br /><br />To fulfill this standard, the teacher could have the student's pair up into groups of 4 to 6. Topics would give to each group to develop a story board. For example: One group may have, Friendship. The group that had friendship couldpick many aspects of the story to develop. One would be the friendship between Charlotte and Wilbur. Another friendship would be between, Wilbur and Fern. After the children have decided which friendship examples to use, I would have them draw pictures of each example and present their work to the class as a group and then put their drawings in order of occurrence on a bulletin board. This activity will also help them recall the chain of events in the story.<br /><br />Another group could work on: Positive/ Negative Attitudes. Examples could be given of Fern's attitude on taking care of Wilbur, Charlotte the spider's positive attitude on helping. Some examples of negative attitudes would be: Templeton's, and the farm animals.<br /><br />BNS
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Love that I can sink across all my devices. It keeps me very organized. Wish I found it sooner. Would suggest to all my friends.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|This book in the series required a little bit more discipline to read than the 1st. Hold on tight, the next one isn't much better.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was a little unsure if I would like this book because the characters are younger but it was amazing! I couldn't put the book down!! Such a great story. I was hoping for a part two!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The characters draw you in and make you constantly question how this Game of Thrones will play out. This book made me feel just about everything a human can feel. Beware though, the next few books of the series may be a let down after reading this one.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This story has it all--lots of laughs, romance, suspense and the need for a lot of tissues.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|As I moved into book three I should have known what to expect, because it was exactly what I got from book one and two. I finished it, but was much more engrossed in the first two of the series.
B001F6ZIXW|2.0|I know people absolutely love this show, but we just couldn't get into it. Maybe it's better in later seasons, but this just isn't for us.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|I loved the first two books in this series and yet on this book I found myself speeding to the finish, not because I couldn't put it down, but because I was dying for something interesting to happen. Slightly disappointed in this book after reading the first two. It might be awhile before I can bring myself to read the next one in the series.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|4 stars.. the second best book in the series besides the hunger games... so much action love and action!!! I said action twice. I know that
B0076DCT2G|4.0|DeMille sets the stage right and is a very smooth writer.  He has researched the culture, the background and underpinnings of one of the most viscious attacks on the US to occur in recent years.  The niche in the armor is well defined and glaringly visible as the sailors lined up in the mess hall for lunch.  The real enemy though is the craziness of narcissim embodied in the chance occurrence of a well primed, physically capable, intelligent, quick thinking, serial killer who is  culturally set up with lots of access, time, and place.
B00AEK9BKQ|4.0|\\"The Sessions\\" is a very good film, but a skeptical viewer might get the impression that Ben Lewin, perhaps on a long transatlantic flight, watched Julian Schnabel's acclaimed 2007 film \\"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly\\" and then watched Crispin Glover's disturbing 2007 film \\"It Is Fine! Everything Is Fine\\", and then got an idea for a movie...

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Had not watched any of this series til I heard about it on the radio station...the DJ loved it so I decided to give it a try and have been so totally hooked.  I love the story line and also love the fact that they don't use the typical sex/violence/distaste of a lot of American shows...I look forward to viewing the rest or Season 3.
1570627215|5.0|Beautiful story that fills me with spiritual satisfaction every time I reach the ending.  A book for all times, but some people could use some cultural background information who are not familiar with Hinduism, Buddhism and Indian Society of the past.  If I could only own one book, this would be it.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Loved the story line.  It was refreshing and honest. I would recommend this book to my friend's. It is a very good escape.<br /><br />Ssprawli
B0012PDVQ2|3.0|It's missing some dialog at the end that was in earlier cuts of this movie where it's explained that Decker & Rachael head north and a few other last details to tie things up.

B0075PYG1M|4.0|Great album. His highlights include the commentary on Black Radio, along with many of my favorite musician/vocalists such as Chrissette Michelle, Lalah Hathaway, Musiq Soulchild, & Ledisi. His arrangement of Cherish the Day is very original & one of my favorites. The Musiq Soulchild selection also remains outstanding. This may well one day prove to be a classic.The instrumentals are also outstanding.

B009LDD5E0|2.0|When \\"Glee\\" first emerged on television during its first season, I was so excited about it, and wouldn't miss an episode, and have continued to watch it every season ever since. Even though there have been a few hits and misses along the lines over the subsequent seasons, mostly though I felt it was a very strong show, and enjoyed it immensely.<br /><br />But that's not the case this season. And, here's why:<br /><br />First off, this show isn't -nor was it ever- just about Rachel Berry becoming a star. Go back and watch season one if you need to, which sounds like some people may. The show was supposed to be about a high school glee club, its teachers, and its students - NOT any particular set of people or one particular person. Which, is what I feel is this season's main downfall: Is following characters who graduated last season and should no longer be on the show.<br /><br />Honestly, I was so ready for a few of them to be gone at the end of season two, and was a little frustrated when I saw them return in season three. But, I feel it is irreprehensible to STILL have them on the show this season! If they felt so strongly about carrying on with storylines that involved characters like Rachel, Kurt, Finn, etc etc, then they should have done a spin-off episode about them, just devoted to them. But they should NOT be carrying them on in this show! They graduated! Time to move on! True story.<br /><br />And, as for the new cast members, well, sadly most of them are bland, and the show kind of comes across like a poor sequel to the show it was; kind of like, well, something like \\"Grease 2\\".<br /><br />And, I've noticed that as the season progresses, the show continues a downward spiral that I really don't foresee it surviving. Such a shame. Even the show \\"Fame\\" (which this show is heavily inspired by) knew when to let characters move on, and how to refreshen and revive itself and stay fresh for several seasons before it finally ended. Sad that I can't say the same for \\"Glee\\".<br /><br />As painful as it's becoming, I will finish watching this season since I've been watching for so long, but after this season, if it returns next season, I won't. Thanks for reading. :>)<br /><br />Randall Brooks<br />(author, \\"The Two Worlds of the Mind\\")<br /><br />Updated edit 4-12-13:<br />After seeing last night's powerful episode, I have to make a change in my review, and that is to say that the new cast members aren't as bland as I thought. Matter of fact, if the show would do like it did in that episode, and forget the d**n New York subplot (and all the previous cast members who graduated last season), and focus on the high school, then the new cast members could shine. They really are a good bunch, but are sadly overshadowed weekly by all the former cast members continuously showing up.\\"Glee\\".<br /><br />As painful as it's becoming, I will finish watching this season since I've been watching for so long, but after this season, if it returns next season, I won't.

B000R7I3LY|4.0|I have to say I really like the songwriting and the performance on this CD.  Sara has amazing control of her voice and what sounds like perfect pitch to me.  The performances are a real joy to listen to.  What I hate about this CD is the mix.  I have to roll the high-end off considerably to make it listenable.  I wonder if anyone else has had that experience.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I didn't like the original temple run but this one was awesooooooooome! It's Outrage!!!'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It has zip lines mine carts and more!!!!<br /><br />IT'S OUTRAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B001ANSSDC|5.0|love the book, love the characters, love the story. At first I was confused...the way it was written looked like it was done by a 12 year old... then I realized it totally made sense the way it was written!
B00AA7O22U|5.0|It's exactly what you expect.  Expendables 1 with bigger guns, explosions, and a few more familiar faces.  Schwarzenegger and Norris have somewhat corny characters, but they don't take anything away from the movie.  Watch it, you know you want to!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Omg... it keeps crashing everytime i try to save my life in that tunnel !  So i deleted it..... and then when i open it again it says -2 gems! I already had 2 gems! CHEATERS -_-

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I loved Temple Run until Temple Run 2; it is so awesome, graphics are amazing and that creature that chases my runner scares me half to death.  such a great game AND FOR FREE!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The first game drove me crazy.. why I purchased this version I will never know. Great game. You got to be quick.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is very addictive and has lots of unexpected twists and turns. I have had so much fun I would recommend it to everyone

B005QUQ99K|3.0|This is a great product, and my nephew loved assembling the pieces.  However, I found the exact same thing for $10 less at Toysrus.com so I sold this one on eBay and then purchased another from ToysRus at nearly half the price.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|You will never in your lifetime hear a voice as attractive and relaxing as Andrea Bocelli&#34;s. This CD does just that. I will be looking for more of his new Cds.\<br />Nic
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|What more can I say, Square did not kill the story, they enhanced it. This movie is very entertaining especially to those of us who know the original FF7 story. Good story, action scenes are intense, music is awesome(dark mood throughout the film with some intense instrumentals) overall a nice addition to the FF7 saga.
B000000WFZ|5.0|If I could give it a sixth star I would. I have shared it with others and they validate what I am writing to you.<br />Nick
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|best movie I've seen in years.  Highly recommend. I was in tears most of the movie.  Everyone who has ever grown up can relate to this in so many ways.
B009YG2ND8|4.0|I'Mry expensive, for a Kindle app. Don't like the use of save points, but that's an FF tradition, and quicksabes are permitted. Otherwise very good. Graphically updated, yet preserves the gsmeplay that made the early FFs famous.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I'm loving this game already! It's fun to play and easy to figure out what to do next. I just got this game today. Fun, fun, fun
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have this app on my Cell phone and my Kindle fire. It is user friendly and easy to access. Love it. Much niver then logging into FB to go there.
0525423656|4.0|I liked this book better than the first book in the trilogy, Matched. In this book, you get to know the characters more...their motivations, experiences, etc. I think the author sets up nicely for the final book, which I am now eager to read. That said, the story does seem to drag at times.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|I guess I figured there was just one way this movie could go at the end, but I still didn't like it.  Otherwise, the movie was entertaining.  It moved at a good clip and had a fair amount of action.  It did, however, drag from time to time and the flashbacks, flashforwards, and dream sequences made it confusing to watch at times.  I also thought that WAY too much make up was used on Gordon-Levitt who just looked comical in many scenes.  Not sure what that was all about.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|As a 16 year old who has been though some of the same things, I think book is absolutely beautiful.
B007B5EDEG|5.0|The characters really come to life, with some you love and some you love to hate. The plot is unpredictable with twists and turns that keep you guessing. Highly recommended for fantasy lovers.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book.  Couldn't put down.  Kept you wondering and guessing. Every chapter kept you wanting more. Best book I have read in awhile. Would recommend.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|There was something incredible about this book. It is difficult to put my finger on it. Perhaps it is because this is a story that's been told one thousand times before by one thousand different authors, and yet, we never tire of reading it. Perhaps it is your story and my story and a story that belongs to the human race as a whole. And maybe it's just because this book reminds us that no matter how bad things become, that they will be all right again someday. I would highly recommend this story to anyone who has ever been a wallflower.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Its a pretty good book.<br />Not a great page turner but enough to keep you interested.<br />Learned a lot about Yemen.
B000W967UQ|5.0|Mort is the story of Death's apprentice.  I love Pratchett's characters and Death is one of my favorites.  He gets a lot of &#34;face time&#34; in this book and his dry humor plays throughout.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Fast Paced, it keeps you and the edge of your seat. Just when you think you have it all figured out it changes. Great book. I would buy it again
0470474874|3.0|I bought this as a reference and it is really set up more like a tutorial.  It does a great job of being a tutorial but I really just needed a quick reference to the syntax of a given function.  This one is not organized for that very well.
0446614459|3.0|I can't complain too much about this book for this one reason:  I had a craving to read a fast-paced, political thriller and this is one. This book was like grabbing a handful of potato chips. It satisfied the immediate urge and the fact that it's not gourmet cuisine isn't the point.<br /><br />Baldacci pens a tight enough mystery until the very end. Readers might be better advised to stop reading just before the last five chapters and, instead, have fun writing in their own ending. Trust me, it couldn't be any more far-fetched than what the actual climax to the book really holds.<br /><br />The \\"mastermind\\" behind all the events seems like he should be a member of the Legion of Doom. He should be fighting Batman and Superman next to Lex Luthor and the Joker. He should be wearing a monocle and stroking the head of a white cat, for goodness sake.<br /><br />You get the picture.<br /><br />Like I said, it's a popcorn book. Enjoy it for what it is; don't expect a nourishing meal.
B000W9399S|3.0|I had seen the movie with Sean Astin and it was my introduction into Discworld.  When I finally got around to reading the book it was delightful but tough to follow and somewhat disjointed.  It did fill in quite a few blanks left open by the movie, however.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I wasn't sure exactly what I was expecting when I downloaded this book. Honestly, I thought it was just some sappy romance novel. Oh it is so much more!! I was drowning in this book, I couldn't put it down. My heart breaks for Sky, Holder, Les, every character... Hoover keeps you turning the page with Hopeless. A very good read.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I love all The American Horror Stories, especially the second season, Asylum! Tight story lines, great acting.<br /><br />Really enjoyed watching them on Amazon Instant Video!
B0074AGVWK|4.0|Many will relate to the adult children still living at home and being funded by their middle aged,  over worked parents. The parents suffering, increased stress and the children having no insight into their self centered behavior! Some times it takes an<br />outsider to open your eyes and make you  appreciate what you have!<br />An interesting look at a new way of solving the situation without dissolving the family bond.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Its like having a personal DJ. Just pick your guanre . It takes it and youl find all the song you love.
0425252868|5.0|War brings out the best in some and the worst in others. This is the story of a German WWII fighter pilot who comes across a heavily damaged U.S. B-17 bomber, limping back toward England. Shooting this bomber down would have made the German pilot eligible for the Iron Cross. But the pilot sees no glory in shooting a damaged bomber. Instead, he escorts it through the anti-aircraft guns at the border of Germany, and salutes the American pilot as he heads off across the English Channel and back to England.This book shows that courage, honor and compassion were not the exclusive domain of the Allied forces. It is a remarkable story and is wonderfully told, making it one of those rare books that you cannot wait to get back to and that you don't want to see end. It is chock full of terror, fear and pain, but ultimately, it's an uplifting story that gave me chills. Read this book. You will not be disappointed.
B00422LESO|4.0|Excellent book! Kept my attention and surprised me some at the end.  Liked the elements of Austen' s books that were drawn in.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's amazing how realistic it is. It's like having your own real horse. Wish stuff was cheaper though. The people should not look plastic dolls. But overall a great game. Definitely worth downloading. :-)

B005LLSNNE|5.0|Awesome show, great actors. Was a bit hesitant at first but once you get into the show and the characters you will not regret starting the show.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Make a third because playing this game is like being glued to your device you should totally get it it's awesome
B000MR1V22|4.0|My granddaughter has had this item on her desired gift list for 2 years.  I bought it for her because it wasnt a horror movie and I refuse to buy those for her.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run 2 is way better then the first!  I love it and so do all my friends. you should really get it if you liked the first one. sometimes it doesn't work but usually it does!
B003B02O14|5.0|Excellent book!  I enjoy the author's ability to capture a reader's interest and maintain it with suspenseful, intriguing, intelligent and steady-paced dialogue. I have to force myself to put the book down and when I do, I look forward to picking it up again. I love the author's attention to detail and his ability to present a divergence in the story-line that the reader has not imagined. A mark of a good story for me is one where-in I cannot predict what's going to happen next. I look forward to reading other of Mr. Grisham's books.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|When I first read the title I was like &#34;WTF over?&#34;. What does &#34;ole&#34; Honest Abe have to do with Vampires?  But after seeing the movie it all makes sense.  Very well done and entertaining.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|Fun for the whole family - The action/adventure reminds me of Indiana Jones.  Good pace, fun mystery for the kids.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|Excellent Flick!!  Very entertaining.  Johhnny Depp does it again.  Very cool characters and not the same old Hollywood BS.  If you liked Sleepy Hollow and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory you will like this.
B0091HVMVO|5.0|As a poor student haunting Uptown Broadway 116th St. in the early 1990's I thought the world revolved around recorded classical music.  I was a major customer of those guys that you see selling CDs on the street next to Tom's Diner on Seinfeld.  $19 for a single CD and often $70 for all those grand opera sets for sale at Tower Records and the newly opened Virgin Records store was commonplace.  I would always walk the 50 blocks there and 50 back to save on the $1 subway token each way.  Hey, It paid for the tax on a CD and was a nice walk.  And then a few years later even at a Best Buy in Roseville, MN there was a dedicated room for classical music CDs.  Unreal!  But it all went to pot, the record companies reaped their massive rewards in a few short-sighted years and let the industry drop into oblivion.  Now 20 years later, some of the best music deals on the planet are available for classical music lovers.  This Philips set is iT!<br /><br />The Mercury set is good, the Decca set is great, but the Philips set is completely awesome!  With almost every CD packed to almost 80 minutes and averaging less than 2 bucks a piece, this set is some deal.  Even owning dozens upon dozens of Philips CDs from the late '80s and 90's, I'm lucky enough to not even have a duplicate.  I guess that illustrates the magnitude of the Philips catalogue.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|works good to save passwords easy to use and can not beat the price. I would recommend this app to use on your tablet

B007IXWL2C|5.0|If you read &#34;Fifty Shades of Gray&#34;, you have to read &#34;Fifty Shades Freed&#34; or you will never know how the relationship between Anastasia and Christian ends. Like the first two books in the trilogy, &#34;Freed&#34; is hard to put down. You just want to keep on reading, and reading until the end and then you are sorry there isn't more. I would recommend this &#34;fifty Shades Freed&#34; to anyone who enjoys a good book.
B008YCMM2A|5.0|This band can also be heard on a live Fillmore set from June of 1970, and on various bootlegs.  And like that official set, this new release is a corker.  Woven into this music is jazz, funk, rock, and something else-courtesy of this band.  These guys are changing music while they're playing it.  First off, Davis doesn't hang back and let the rest of the band take over.  He's fully engaged and in charge.  He's throwing out stabs of trumpet that fit into the music like the meshing of well worn gears.  At other times his trumpet solos seem to just flow out of him.  It's evident that he's full of ideas on where he wants to go with both the band and the music.  For a band that lasted only a couple of years, their level of intuitiveness and penchant for playing exciting music is awesome.  Make no mistake-this is another of Davis' classic line ups.  At times there's a feeling of a sizzling electricity surrounding this band.  The music seems to move under it's own power, yet it's controlled before everything can unravel.<br /><br />Besides Davis, Corea was playing some of his best music yet.  His keyboard work brings this music to life.  And Shorter was still playing with excitement and inventiveness, even though he would leave the band a short time later.  But the real secret of this band was the rhythm section.  Holland on bass-how could it get any better?  And with DeJohnette's more straightforward style, the soloists knew they could go anywhere and still find their way back.  In my opinion the rhythm section is this band's secret weapon.<br /><br />The first two discs have several compositions that fans of this period will know-two versions each of of \\"Directions\\", \\"Miles Runs The Voodoo Down\\", and \\"Sanctuary\\".  This is a great way to hear how these compositions change and morph into something different each time they're played.  The intensity ebbs and flows on each version, but the music never seems to flag.  And check out \\"Footprints\\" (especially), and \\"'Round Midnight\\" for a look at how these two favorites are handled.  At this point Davis was still incorporating compositions from his past, something that he did less frequently as time (and his musical restlessness) moved on.<br /><br />Disc 3 may be even better.  The versions of \\"Bitches Brew\\" and \\"Paraphernalia\\" are high points. \\"Nefertiti\\" is here again, and is another example of how well this band could approach such a well known Davis tune, and reconstruct it.  This concert can hold it's own from this period as far as pure musicality, inventiveness, and intuition among this short lived quintet.  And considering that these sets were from the beginning (1969) of this particular band, the music is that much more impressive.  Davis always said that this band needed to be recorded live on stage-and now you can hear why.<br /><br />The DVD is about 3/4 of an hour of great performances from Davis and the band.  It's yet another concert, this time from Berlin.  To hear and now see this band on stage is something.  \\"Directions\\", \\"Bitches Brew\\" and \\"Sanctuary\\" do it for me-you may have other high points.  But any footage of this band is very worthwhile.  And here let's talk about the sound.  The first two discs suffer from slight distortion and a slight flatness to the overall sound-but is still very good.  So don't expect fantastic live sound.  The \\"booklet\\" is a large (14\\" X 18\\") poster, folded many times to fit into the CD package.  One side is a b&w photo of most of the band, and the other has a long essay on the music, plus pertinent track/recording information.<br /><br />As always with Davis, people are divided.  Some say \\"sell out\\".  Others hear this music as an experiment-possibly a new direction for jazz.  Davis was playing The Fillmore during this era, and playing alongside bands like Steve Miller, and The Dead (and like The Dead Davis segues from one tune to the next without interruption here) playing electric music.  Jazz Purists were outraged.  Davis playing \\"formless\\" music with amplified instruments?  His trumpet connected to a wha-wha pedal?  But Davis was constantly changing, probing for something new.  And for fans (like me) of his probing musicality this will be an exciting set to hear.\\" music with amplified instruments?  His trumpet connected to a wha-wha pedal?

0547884591|5.0|These books are always a wealth of knowledge and jam packed with great info! I am always excited when he comes out with a new book.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|This movie wasn't quite what I expected, but it wasn't bad.  I kind of expected a little more (not really sure what), but I do like how they tied the war into it and gave a different random take on the whole thing.
B00447L4JG|5.0|Got this for my niece for Christmas she had been wanting it for soooooo long so I got this for her and she just watches it over and over and over again
B0088WK27S|4.0|Really liked this movie.  I know it's based on a true story, but when they say that you're never sure how much of the story is actually true or not, but the end of the movie has pictures of the real life family.  I personally thought this was a really good movie and would recommend it and watch it again.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I thin  this game is so much fun and full of new adventure<br />The base of the game is some much fun
B0053O89WY|5.0|Not much else I can say except this show is just awesome!  I love this show and if you haven't seen it, WATCH IT!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl totally kept me guessing!  I've told all my friends this is a must read!<br />The ending left me wanting more so maybe I'll have to read it again.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|I thought this was a good movie.  A good story.  Some funny parts, but overall a good story.  A little sappy about a father daughter story mixed in with a romantic story between the daughter and someone else, but overall I was able to get in to it and really like it and would watch it again.  Plus who doesn't like Clint Eastwood's dry humor.
B002VQ7PVS|5.0|There is no more imaginative novelist writing today than William Boyd. To cite just three of his novels, in addition to Restless, there is Any Human Heart, a chronicle spanning most of the 20th Century on four continents; an exciting and disturbing examination of chimpanzees and the scientist who study them, in Brazzaville Beach, set mostly in Africa; and The Blue Afternoon, in which Boyd  has crafted a compelling family mystery beginning in 1930s Los Angeles, moving to the turn of the last century in Manila, and concluding in Lisbon just prior to the second World War.  In Restless, Boyd returns to World War II, telling a thrilling story of a beautiful spy of Russian descent working for the British.  As she tells her story to her unsuspecting daughter some 30 years later, we learn of the sacrifices she and others made for their political and nationalistic goals, and the toll those choices took.  The novel has it all:  love, sex, cloak and dagger intrigue, shocking surprises, murder and betrayal.<br /><br />William Boyd has a number of prizes to his credit for his incredible range or work.  While the subject matter changes radically from novel to novel, what unites them is the style and readability evident on each page.  Boyd is a writer in complete command of his craft.  For anyone fascinated by World War II, the added bonus is that you will learn a great deal about the machinations of individuals and countries jockeying for supremacy more than 70 years ago.
B002PNAY9C|5.0|So much better than book two.  Heart felt & emotional.  Gearing you up for the final battle.  Tear jerking.  Great book
B00B2V66VS|1.0|loved it on the first three plays. after five sequential forces uninstalled it. wish it worked bc it was great. it would get as far as the initial loading screen, hang, and then close.
1419705849|4.0|I bought two of these, one for each grandson (ages 10 and 12) to add to their collection.  Each one enjoyed it and said they were glad they read it and would recommend it to others.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I absolutely love this trilogy. The world of the districts and their relationship with the Capitol bears frightening similarities to what our own world is becoming, with a government that rules like a parasite, bloated and oppressive.  Cynicism and apathy become the tools of survival, and the best hope of escape from the paralysis of conformity ultimately becomes the sacrifice of children in the Hunger Games, where the odds are against the poorest districts.The victors live in luxury, but their guilt makes life unbearable and redemption possible only through further violence and sacrifice.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This really is a nice little flash, but not one that I use very much.. I prefer the SB-600's I have.. However, I think they have stopped making those.. As for this one, it works great, if you  use it correctly and within its limited conditions.. The bigger issue I have with it is that I it does not work do well with the zoom lens. Because it is so close to the top of the camera, at many zoom lengths, there is a shadow on the bottom of you photos!!!!! If it could be higher in the air, it would work great... On short lens, it is a winner. It also does well if used as a bounce flash. So, it works, but it does not have much power, and is limited... You have to practice with it a lot to get the hang of what you can and cannot do with it.... I carry mine as a simple backup for the bigger ones.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is great game and it has options. My favorite is spider 2 suits. But you have the option to play it like you want. Movement is smooth, and  has a nice little cheat (hint) button.
B000I9YLUI|5.0|Pride & Prejudice is one of my favorite books, I've read it at least a dozen times.  This film version is very faithful to the main storyline and the important side stories as well.  Brenda Blethin (sp?) does a fantastic job as silly, vapid Mrs. Bennett and Donald Sutherland is spot-on as snarky Mr. Bennett. Keira Knightley is not a favorite actress of mine but she does a fine job as heroine Elizabeth Bennett.  Matthew McFadyen is a smoldering, tense, and prideful Darcy.  When he finally relaxes and smiles, your heart melts!  Simon Woods and Rosamund Pike do a beautiful job portraying sweet and affable Mr. Bingley and Jane, respectively.  Caroline Bingley is snotty, proud, and gorgeous.  Dame Judi Dench as Lady Catherine is superb.  She is derisive and arrogant in full measure.  When she confronts Elizabeth...watch out!<br /><br />I ordered the digital copy of this as well as the dvd copy.  The scenery, settings, and music are just lovely.  You will want to watch this film again and again.  And then probably once more.  =)
B00A77II0U|4.0|Not as good a story or graphics as with some games like Dragonwheel, Empress of the Deep or Shadowlands, and the voodoo doll looks too much like Elmo, but it functions well and mini games are good. Overall a fun game and worth the money.
B0000028RR|1.0|I have waited for this for a long time....... Should not have taken this long ..... Please check on shipment
B0098VYCCE|3.0|The movie is godd but it was alot just for borowing it. I think what you guys should do is let people barrow it for a certain amount of days for free but if they go over that amount of days then you should start charging
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I pretty much watched this in one weekend. I was very entertained, now I even read the comics. Love this.
B005NS5CX4|5.0|My wife is a big fan of their music and really loves all of the songs. Will probably purchase more in the future.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love Jewels Star. It is fun, challenging, fast, and entertaining. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a fast paced game.
B009X01GJ2|4.0|I give it 4 1/2  stars because it is a little difficult to remove the kindle fire from the case.  Otherwise, it is great!
B004UUKDNA|5.0|If you like Vampire Weekend, you'll love Foster the People. Every song is good (love it when that happens!), and I've listened to it almost on constant rotation for months and months now. So catchy and fun!
B004I8WD7S|4.0|I bought this because in my new job I need to use my personal phone and have it on me at all times.  Since most of my dress clothes don't have pockets, I needed a smaller case (I had an Otterbox Defender), and a way to carry my phone.  I purchased this smaller case and a leather holder and it fits fine.  This case is part plastic with a slight gel feel.  I think it will protect my phone to the degree I need it to.
B000001I0K|3.0|There is more than punk rock here. The thoughts may of come out of New York City but the music has a Memphis sound, thanks to the late great Alex Chilton. I do not listen to it straight through but love it on my I pod shuffle. A little weirdness is good.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I like Stephen King & didn't know about this one. Good as always. Looking at a few others I didn't know about either.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|In short: Great app! I use it exclusively to go to sleep and wake up!<br /><br />At legnth: I purchased this app (not really, it was the FAOTD) for the sole purpose of waking up in a gentler way as opposed to stock alarms. I have been using the Sound Sleep Deluxe (SSD) app when it was the FAOTD and I believe that is the most comparable app. It does not have the background music that SSD has (not a bad thing) but it does have MANY more sounds to choose from... all of which sound great. You can set AND save alarms (unlike SSD!), you can chose the fade in time (if you do not prefer the gradual wakeup), the day of the week it is active and you can choose any of the sounds to wake up to. You can also set the countdown time if you have trouble falling asleep.<br /><br />In conclusion: I highly recommend this app and would have paid full price having known how great it is.
B00070DK5K|4.0|Had this double album back in high school. While nothing is as good as good vinyl this CD Rocks. David Bowie always puts on a great show and the band is top notch. The Diamond Dogs Tour was on of his best. The sound is much cleaner than the Ziggy Stardust days.  Half a dozen added classic Bowie Tracks not included on the LP only enhances the experience. All CD's that a remade from vinyl back in the day should be this good. The horns and vocals are very clear and there is a good soundstage making you feel the band is right there.  Reccomended
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I love any game that has to do with searching I just love it and I also like the storyline of the game please keep it coming make more games like this one and I am sure to get it on my kindle every game that I see I purchase and I download them quick even if it takes me like 2 days to finish it or more than so I just wanted to say thank you very much I really enjoyed this game a lot.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I you loved MIB 1 and 2 you will not be disapointed with MIB3.  Great cast that brings an older star back to life on the screeen.
B00AKOB7CG|1.0|it worked briefly but now it says its not responding! my other apps work but the apps for the entire workout series load and then says not responding. it looks like a great app if only i could use it.
B00AE2IJIE|2.0|Unless you have young kids that want to watch a show with a paranormal twist, then I suggest you look elsewhere for you entertainment.
B009C7JS14|1.0|Did not work with my android and reacted badly with other apps. I think it was too complicated and quirky.
B007ZCOOHG|4.0|While some of the rules are contradictory of some of Barneys actions this book is a great laugh with good rules and advice. Mr Stinsons character is very apparent in the book. Brilliant.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I have to agree with the other reviewers here, this is a must have game for the PS vita. This series has been my favorite for quite some time now. I really like the little updates they've put in since the PS2 release. It's a lot of fun, so be prepared to put a lot of time into this game.
0375413405|5.0|Recipies were easy to follow. Many great traditional recipies were tried and successfully completed.<br />Basic ingredients were used and not complicated.
B0091LF2QQ|5.0|I was a little disappointed with the second release, but Mika is back on track with this one. Virtually every cut is solid, worth purchasing the whole CD. Whole family loves it, looking forward to a US tour.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|so yeah awesome game so worth it it takes up some space but really fun. if you like horses or animals or just want a fun game with out gimics look no further.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Simple and quick with one ad in the beginning - a small price to pay. Very quick and responsive with hints to boot.
B007KAJG3K|5.0|What is there not to like about this great action movie.  Awesome sequel.  Robert Downey Jr. does some great acting in this movie.  Great special effects.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I'm enjoying the new temple run. Just as addicting as the first temple run as well as temple run brave. I love the new features as well. Lots of fun.
B005S9EK1S|5.0|I bought this movie without any clue as to what the movie was about.  It was very affordable and I just went for it.  The movie is actually a different kind of contemporary love story.
B007RI56NY|4.0|The thing I really like about Train is that their work exists on two levels simultaneously. The music is catchy and you want to hum along, but simmering under it is a level of quick wit, humor and poetry that you might miss if all you listened to was the tune. Switching &#34;50 ways to leave your lover&#34; into &#34;50 ways to say goodbye&#34; was good, but to add the humor and realism of wanting to tell everyone that your ex lover didn't actually leave but died a horrible and painful, even tragic death? That's classic. And who else could put a 'crappy purple Scion' into a lyric?
B003VS0CX8|5.0|The Audio and Video quality of this transfer to Blu-ray is Amazing.  The movie seems freshly made.  Was so content with the very low price I paid.
159102594X|1.0|I am sorry folks, I just couldnt get into this series. I have read literally thousands of Sword and Sorcery books in my life and this one really has little to recommend it. There has to be something to cheer for or look forward to and there is nothing. Because I like trilogy's I bought all three of them but only finished  read them so that i would not have totally wasted my money. The trilogy is well written and all fight scenes were realistic but those are the only pros. This is a Dark and Bloody story with no winners. If you want to read the trilogy used I will be selling these three books back to Amazon for resale
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have been aching for this app and it is finally here! This is way better than the original TR!
B00003CXBK|5.0|This movie is absolutely fantastic. This is a great addition to any anime or movie collection. You will not regret buying this
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book but didn't find it as gripping as the first two books of the milennium.  There were many pages of boring conversations and statistics about Swedish law that I didn't find interesting.  I realize some of it was needed to keep the story going but felt there was too much.  Otherwise I liked it very much and am saddened that there won't be any more books by Mr. Larsson.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|I like this version of the story better than the one from several years ago starring &#34;The Governator&#34;. They did a good job of creating an interesting post-apocalyptic earth.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I loved this story because it kept me guessing from beginning to end. The characters were all interesting, some likeable some detestable, but all interesting.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This was a great game to pass the time in the airport. Was easy and fun to play. Good purchase.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is a very nice game.  my grandson loves it and plays all the time and so does his sister
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|my title says it all this game is just plain out awesome<br />now I need to get a few more words in so ill say get the dart machine gun. thing
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think that temple run 2 is one of the funnest  games I've ever played and I think that it is awesome. So a big shout out to the creators and the, co creators. Guys you rule.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A great read.  I found myself totally engaged from the beginning.  The characters were so easy to care about and I missed them when the book was over
0061537969|5.0|I loved this book! Everyone should read it! Even if you hate dogs (who hates dogs?), you will love this book. I had a book hang over and couldn't read anything else for three weeks, this book was so thought provoking. But not in a painful I have to study kind of way, but in a epiphany kind of way. I am a happier person for having read this book.
B000001GQP|5.0|This is undoubtedly the best recording of this piece I have ever heard. And, it has all 24 stanzas! If you like this piece of music, you have to hear this version.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|When I try to play it on my kindle fire sometimes it works and other times...not so much. A few time all it did was show the imangi studios logo and then went back to the home screen. But other than that its a pretty fun game!! I suggest it if you have patience (which I don't)
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is a WWII true story that dramatically recounts an encounter of two pilots -- one German, one American -- and tells the rest of the war story of the German.  Contrary to many/most WWII memoirs, this one is readable and utilizes correct grammar.<br /><br />This is perfect -- PERFECT -- for high school kids interested in WWII lore.  We find ourselves more and more often engaging the veterans we meet in conversation, if they are willing to share their war experiences.  We look for the guys wearing those \\"Veteran\\" hats and always shake their hands.  Sometimes they don't have the time/inclination to answer any questions (my boys have a LOT of questions) but we always make sure to acknowledge and thank them for their service and try to find out where/when they served.<br /><br />Other books my WWII kids like are<br /><br />[[ASIN:0786817534 Under a War-Torn Sky]]<br />[[ASIN:0385730918 Left for Dead: A Young Man's Search for Justice for the USS Indianapolis]]<br />[[ASIN:1400064163 Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption]]
B007THA4FI|2.0|I had a hard time understanding this book. I lost interest and the plot never appeared. I read it to the end but would not read anything like it again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love the game. Very fun for me and the kids. Was a ton of fun learning how to use it. Would definitely purchase it if was required
B008FPOIT6|4.0|As a bibliophile, I loved Mr. Penumbra's bookstore, and would have LOVED to shop there.  The book was well-written, and at the end, I didn't want to put it down.  For the rest, it was one of those books that was a really comfortable read...it was nice to sink into but it wasn't wrenching to put it down and turn off the Kindle.  The mysterious aspect didn't grab me the way it was probably supposed to, but the author did a great job with character development, and I cared about what was happening to them.  The look inside Google was fascinating - I'd love to know how much was based on fact!
B004SDEP38|2.0|I was looking for an app that I can use in class, something simple. I downloaded this, and it looked promising, until I went to create a new document and a window popped up saying &quot;this is a feature available in the pro version.&quot;<br />buyer beware, this is a read-only app.<br />uninstalled.
B004SBX112|5.0|Great app for the price.  Works as expected without any problems.  I am happy with the performance on the kindle fire.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Classic and one of the best reads. In high school I hated it but as I have grown older I learned to like some classics
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Great app for the price.  Works as expected without any problems.  I am happy with the performance on the kindle fire.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|So many of my friends would talk about this game. I played one time and was hooked. Now I have all my family loving this game. I love strategy games!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Great app for the price.  Works as expected without any problems.  I am happy with the performance on the kindle fire.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I've been reading SF and Fantasy since 1975 and still love the genres, however, for many years now everything I read seems at best predictable.  Anthony Ryan has written a fabulous story that feels fresh and engaging, with great plot and chanracter development.  Also, it's considerably more enjoyable for more mature readers than most.  Thank you Anthony Ryan for giving the grown ups something to look forward to!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Great app for the price.  Works as expected without any problems.  I am happy with the performance on the kindle fire.
B006CHML4I|5.0|I was going to get the Timex Andros from J.Crew for my boyfriend but the quality of that watch wasn't worth the price, so I got this instead... and my boyfriend loves it! Definitely a quality product for a great price. It's casual, simple and classy.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great app for the price.  Works as expected without any problems.  I am happy with the performance on the kindle fire.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Overall it's good. I like the fact that there is more things to do like gliding down the rope and other things. Temple run would always be a good game no matter what.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great app for the price.  Works as expected without any problems.  I am happy with the performance on the kindle fire.
B008MM9630|4.0|I think that tgis is a fun &amp; adicting game. this game is a lot like farmstory &amp; farmville. I would recommend getting this game if you like farmstory. enjoy;)
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Great app for the price.  Works as expected without any problems.  I am happy with the performance on the kindle fire.
B006S08RLU|4.0|Amelie is one of those films that is never quite what I remember it to be.  I think the story is going this way, and it goes another and I remember, &#34;oh, that's right&#34;.  Like many films these days, it's a film set in a real world location (Paris) but filmed in colors and styles of clothing that create a fantasy world within reality.  Much of the film is about Amelie's search for a man whose childhood box of toys she finds hidden in a wall; with another line pursuing a man whose photos she finds near photo booths;  Who is he?  Why is he taking these pictures?  And, it's a bit of a gawky romance between her oddball character and an equally geeky guy she's known for a while.  It's not a film I would watch over and over, but I have seen it more than once and always enjoyed watching.<br /><br />And, if you find yourself in Paris, go to the subway stop in the movie, Abbesses.  It's near Monmartre and Sacre Cour, and has (in a subway system that is itself almost defined by its staircases) one of the longest spiral staircases I've been on this side of the Statue of Liberty or Sacre Cour.  One wonders where or if one will ever get out.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Great app for the price.  Works as expected without any problems.  I am happy with the performance on the kindle fire.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|This is hilarious but not for everyone.  If you do not enjoy the Monty Python or Mr. Bean style sense of humor this is NOT for you.  If you find those movies funny (or like me you start to giggle at the very mention of them) you will enjoy this collection.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|OMG! BY far the best book I've read since fifty Shades. So intense, witty, beautiful, heart breaking, amazing!!!!!! You have to read this book. I can't wait to read more Colleen Hoover books.
B000002H97|4.0|I literally listened to this disc so much it couldn't be repaired so I had to buy a new disc.  Classic album by Metallica and will never &#34;go out of style&#34;
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game has better graphics and amazing new obstacles! I played temple run 56x  and temple run 2 49x temple run 2 is much better than temple run 1 but I still love temple run 1 . I hope you will like it as much as I do! ( ps a great game to play when you are bored or waiting!)
B0017V7H70|5.0|I literally listened to my original disc so much it cannot be repaired.  This is just a classic album that will always sell.  You can't go wrong with this disc!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|There is just one problem; this app is too great. It's beautiful and better than any hand-held calculator. It's worth more than free.
B00023B1LC|5.0|The trilogy (not that Legacy crap) is great fun and enjoyable to watch.  I like the extended version because some parts make more sense or you get to see the greater scope of the director's vision.  I'd buy it again.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Silly, yes, but none the less, entertaining! Would definitely recommend if you are looking for something easy to watch. Enjoy!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|an overall great game!  My 5 year old and my 15 year old play this all the time, they cant' get enough of it.
B000SEIDR0|5.0|Michael Pollan writes beautifully so if you enjoy good prose read this just for the joy of it. He has thoroughly researched the material, a fact that comes through clearly in his in-depth reflections of matters of ethics related to food production, animal slaughter, and hunting in particular. In the book, the author takes a look at how food gets to the table in different systems: the current industrial food system including both conventionally and organically produced food, the &#34;eat local&#34; movement, and a hunter-gatherer approach. He follows the food through each system as best he can (none of the operators of meat packing plants would allow him to observe the killing floor, for example) and reports the facts with interpretation based not solely on his viewpoint, but including philosophical work done by others. Not all of these other viewpoints were contemporary (he even references Plato at one point) bringing home the fact that the issues under consideration are not new to human thinking, not a product of our time when so many of us sit atop Maslow's hierarchy seeming to need something to worry about, but a product of serious, long-standing ethical considerations. The term, Omnivore's Dilemma, refers the problem of identifying which food is safe to eat (mushrooms get a lot of attention) as this is not at all a book in the vein of Fast Food Nation, not an expos&eacute; of the food industry, although it incorporates some of the same information. This book is a realistic look at how food moves from origin to the table in the modern world with a side trip to how it did so in the long ago.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Cool game. My daughter loves it. I like it also.  Very interactive and entertaining.  Kids get the opportunity to learn the terms related to horses and the areas around the barn. They can pick clothes for themselves and tack for the horses
B008YU0AOE|5.0|It is a simple and straight forward calculator. I don't misplace my Kindle like I do a calculator, so I am not hunting around for one to balance my checkbook.<br /><br />At my age I really like the big numbers. Apparently not designed by a 20 year old who has perfect vision.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game!  Addictive and fun.  My kids like it the most and play it the most, but great for adults too.
B0001XAPY2|4.0|Having seen all of Miyazaki's film's it's easy to see why this film is often overlooked or under appreciated. Nowhere is there a altruistically nice likable main character. The film does not contain a message about peace like Nausicaa, relate the importance of the environment in Mononoke Hime or explore the fantastical that fills films like Spirited Away, Totoro or Ponyo. Instead, this film's charm comes from it's down to earth, straightforward linear tale of air fighting and love in the Mediterranean.<br /><br />Porco Rosso was a fighter pilot who was also a womanizer and outright jerk. This selfish, chauvinistic man was by his action turned literally into a pig and now spends his days being a celebrated bounty hunter but also being haunted by his past. Times change and Porco Rosso is forced to confront his past and deal with challenges that are thrust upon him. The brightest moment of the film is also the only fantastical bit of storytelling where Porco Rosso tells how he became cursed. The flashback scene is gorgeous and is pure Miyazaki.<br /><br />There never is really any great evil or villain in this film. Instead we are treated to a nice fantasy/slice of life tale that dabbles in the fantastic. I have read others complain about the ending but I personally found it refreshing. Overall, I enjoyed this film and imagine young viewers will like the action and comedy while adults will enjoy the more serious themes about life and love.<br /><br />Recommended!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I like the wide variety of sounds and you can combine them with each other for even more variety for you
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I've been reading Percy Jackson books since Lightning Thief came out and have loved them ever since! This one does not disappoint. A great read for any fan of the series.
B0086700CM|5.0|My 3 kids play this game more than I do by far!  They love it and keeps their attention when

1481251880|5.0|***Warning, this is my attempt at a review. It won't be pretty***<br />\\"It's real, Six. You can't get mad at a real ending. Some of them are ugly. It's the fake happily ever afters that should piss you off.\\"<br /><br />I read this book the first couple days of January and I still can't properly put into words what I feel about this book. Every time I took a moment to even attempt to write this review, my mind went blank. But no matter how long ago I read this book, it feels like I just read it yesterday because it was that powerful that I still can't stop thinking about it. I may have also encouraged persuaded bullied other people to read it because I just want everyone to be able to experience this story. To say that I loved this book would be a severe understatement. To even say this is one of the best books I have ever read would be another understatement. The story of Sky and Holder is tragic, heart breaking, and highly emotional. It is also one of the best love stories I have ever read. Like Slammed and Point of Retreat, the summaries from Goodreads do NOT do this book any justice. At all! Just trust me when I say that this book is a MUST.<br /><br />From their first encounter, the best way to describe Sky and Holder is intense! Everything about them is intense: their feelings, their kisses, and their fights. Their relationship is complicated (another understatement). It starts off slow, shifts to fast, stops, speeds up, then full throttle rollercoaster. I loved the banter between Sky and Holder. They weren't expressing their feelings all the time but they had their own special way of letting each other (and us) know that they are crazy about each other. Example:<br /><br />\\"You need a hair cut,\\" I blurt out. \\"Really bad. It gets in your eyes and you squint and you're constantly moving it out of the way like you're Justin Bieber and it's really distracting.\\"<br />He fingers his hair with his hand and frowns, then falls back onto the bed.<br />\\"Man. That really hurt.\\"<br /><br />or<br /><br />I'm really dreading spending all day with you. This doesn't sound like fun at all. Also, your sundress is really unflattering and way too summery, but you should definitely keep it on.<br /><br />Just when it seems like Sky and Holder have conquered all their problems and I'm thinking: \\"Wow, this is an amazing love story\\" BAM! Huge plot twist in the story that I NEVER saw coming! Then, when we are finally adjusting and getting over the shock of that plot twist and your thinking: \\"Wow, this is a really amazing story. Period.\\" Double-BAM!! This story freaking broke me apart and made my heart hurt so much. But the ending also left me feeling very happy. Has my heart recovered from this story? Nope, but I loved every single second of this book. Even the ones the really painful ones. Sky and Holder's problems don't magically get fixed by the end of the book and the ending is not an unrealistic happily ever after. It is happy, but is it also a realistic ending which I loved. Hopeless is a powerful story that you WON'T want to miss out on. A story and characters that will stay with for a very long time. Although the love story is amazing, this is so much more than just that. Oh, and if you are looking for swoon worthy ladies, look no further than Dean Holder. He is one of the most complicated characters I've and one of my favorites. I would also like to mention that Hopeless has the title of best non-first kiss EVER! I just wanna point out that no matter what my ramblings may come off as, this is not a depressing story. It has plenty of sweet, romantic and happy moments. But it is also real, and we all know real is not always pretty.<br /><br />5 out of 5 stars!<br />(If my rating system had more stars, I would give them all to this book)<br /><br />Some of my favorite non-spoiler quotes from Hopeless:<br />-I need to regain my bearings. Somehow, in the course of sixty seconds, this guy has managed to swoon me, then terrify the hell out of me.<br /><br />-\\"Let me inform you of something,\\" he says in a low voice. \\"The moment my lips touch yours, it will be your first kiss. Because if you've never felt anything when someone's kissed you, then no one's ever really kissed you. Not the way I plan on kissing you.\\"<br /><br />-I know that firsts don't matter with him. He could kiss me for the first time, or the twentieth time, or the millionth time and I wouldn't care if it was a first or not, because I'm pretty sure we just broke the record for the best first kiss in the history of first kisses - without even kissing.<br /><br />- The way he looks at me makes me feel...I try to search for an adjective to follow up that thought, but I can't find one. He just makes me feel. He's the only boy that's ever cared whether or not I'm feeling anything at all, and for that alone, I let him steal another small piece of my heart. But it doesn't feel like enough, because I unexpectedly want to give it all to him.<br /><br />(There are wwaaaay more but I don't wanna spoil anything)<br />***<br />Read more of my reviews at:<br />Nereyda @Mostly YA Book Obsessede.<br /><br />-\\"Let me inform you of something,\\" he says in a low voice. \\"The moment my lips touch yours, it will be your first kiss.

B005LAII80|4.0|I had not watched the comic book before so I simply enjoyed this movie as it was, a hardcore action sci-fi movie highly exciting and entertaining with tons of gun blast and explosion scenes. The setup of which two good cops fought against an army of bad guys with heavy weapons inside a totally locked up 100+ storey building of small apartments and one good cop being a rookie psychic had added tremendous tension and reasonableness to the movie. Although Dredd was always wearing its masked helmet, I couldnt help myself to imagine that Stallone had been acting all the time. In short, recommended!

B0056CUZRA|5.0|As usual from Ken Follett it is a excelent book and very believeable  it has kept me spell bound right from the start<br />Fall of Giants belongs to the top of the list
B00005K3OT|5.0|I have watched this movie several times and will watchit again.  It has all the elements of a classic.  I am not a fan of Albert Molina although he is a good actor  He is unattractive
B0073LWEXK|1.0|After starting this game over for the fifth time, I am about to throw it away. It freezes if you take too long on the symbol puzzle and when i finally got all the symbols in the right spot, nothing opened or clicked. I could only do spring and winter. No hints helped and there was nothing else to do. Tapping every single inch on each screen hoping to find something!, i am not playing anymore  until reviews are stating that problems are fixed. Very frustrating  indeed.
B005K0HDGE|1.0|I dont as a rule read Stephen King books however,  this is totally different but its is painful to read .
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I log the game its just that it is very slow on my kindle fire it also always freezing and that u don't get a lot of gems I think this game is fun but slow
B005LAIIA8|2.0|The 1984 version had live players, including the charming bull terrier, telling a straight forward story. I treasure it, short as it is. This new version's animated charafcters are grotesque, and the story padded with byplots to make it full length.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|I have ran this app seven times 5 out of 7 times it didn't run and when it did it wasn't that good! Too much instructions! You had to train too much before you could compete! Don't waste your time on this app! I love horses and this didn't give me what I was looking for!
B007MB5OCE|4.0|original, a little quirky, entertaining. i enjoyed it. a good light reading, i'm on vacation book. it's worth a peek.

B004UHSB5A|3.0|The game is OK, but many times when I drag the dominos into place, they don't stay where I want them and they go back down to the bottom of the screen.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is a must read.  The whole trilogyg is a must read.  This book takes it a step farther...
B004SUWR2C|3.0|When I tried to put my name it, it wouldn't let me type any vowels...next time it worked OK,...next time there were other letters it wouldn't let me use.  Once I got past that, it seemed to bo OK, but rules are hard to figure out.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|I loved every inch of this book and highlighted the heck out of it.  Sometimes Quentin's thoughts gave too much away when he was dissecting his poem, more could have been left up to the reader to apply to their own lives but still an excellent read nonetheless.
B0073PPNE8|5.0|all this is true and verified and that family inmans are still there.<br />a little liscense was taken fro the trip home
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a great game. I was impressed by how accurate the game was and the animation was very realistic.
B007SGM084|3.0|Loved being able to get the book on my tablet. Very disappointed that the aurthor doesn't allow sharing of the book. I feel that I paid for the book and should be able to share it with family members considering I paid what it would have cost me to purchase it in the store.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This is your typical happy-ever-after novel. I personally loved I  because I'm just that type of girl....a real sucka for romance novels. But I promise you, even if you aren't, you still won't be sorry. It's the oldest play in  the book where two people meet and end up getting married in none other than Vegas. Going in, not wanting love but end up seeing the benefits of being wholly,completely in love. So be sure to read this story whenever you have  the chance because, frankly, it's just a great book that makes us believe in \\"true love conquers all\\" even for a little while.
B0011KQSZ4|4.0|This is the original movie! It is great. You really have to enjoy British humor to &#34;get it.&#34; The cast is great. The scenery is pretty plain but it works well with the movie. Great Funny movie!
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run' s graphics just pop on my kindle fire hd !<br />Will be a TR fan forever! Love the game, It's way too addicting

B00AMBLXP8|5.0|i love it excellent funny movie i ever seen recommend all 100% i can't wait for second part !!!!!!!11 11
B0048WQDIE|5.0|Although I am in my late 60s with a Ph.D. in English, I had not read the novel. Having heard the phrase, &#34;Catch-22,&#34; all my life, I decided it was high time to do so. First, I listened to the audio version. Then, intrigued and wanting to see the actual words, I got the Kindle version. The novel is both hilarious and highly disturbing. If you like M*A*S*H, you'll love CATCH-22.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|/-)i<br /><br />I cant wait to get back and play every chance I get. I love hatching the eggs and playing the scratch game.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Excellent!!  Excellent!!!  I love this as much as &#34;The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo.&#34;  Once you start reading it, you can't put in down.I would definitely read Steeig Larsson's other books.  Keep on writing.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Even though this book was not a newly published book and a some of it was dated. it was so funny, it didn't care. I laugh from being to end. It does have some serious thoughts.  I liked those, too.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game.  It's just like having a real horse!  I recommend trying it for yourself.  The graphics are so realistic - I love taking photos of my horse.
B0022W6L6G|5.0|REally do I have to say anything.  If you like Fleetwood Mac, then this is the the Greatest Hits CD for you.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Finally! A paranormal romance from the POV of the male character. It's about time! Definitely read the book before you see the movie, I'm sure they will leave out many an important and interesting aspect of the story... Hollywood always does.
B000AMJC2K|2.0|Only 2 stars because will not work as a laptop stand with the Neo-flex laptop holder.<br /><br />I have other Neo-Flex products. They have great quality. But this one will not articulate low enough to use with a notebook PC. But it would probably be good for use with a monitor.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Must have for all kindle owners.<br />Easy to use and simple interface.<br />Would be willing the purchase this.<br />5 out of 5
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I don't know what more I can say about firefly that hasn't already been said 100 times.  This show is amazing and it's a real tragedy it was discontinued.  Yes, it's a &#34;western in space&#34; but it also has a neat feel, a unique 'verse and compelling characters.  If you haven't seen it, do! And if you have, well, you know you want to own it...
B004U52VPS|1.0|My son was so excited to save up and buy this game, but sadly it came and he was upset. In order to really enjoy it you have to buy extra pieces to build the fun sets. No thank you!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app works as promised with no conflicts or problems.  Happy that it is so easy to use.  Important to keep up the charge.
B0094KF4WG|5.0|Great insight into special ops<br />Was hooked since the first page, would love to read about other missions also .
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|a useful free product that Will help collect random thoughts during the day.  i suggest you download it and try it
B009YP9L7U|1.0|I did not like this book. The plot was good but the writing was terrible. At times I did not understand what the author was talking about.
B0036TGT3E|3.0|Did Elton john get lost in the transition from VCR to blue ray?  The quality is fine but I wanted to hear Elton!
B0022W6L6G|5.0|I just love this band and it was a great buy for me!  They are one of my favorite bands of all times....
B00915G6MG|5.0|I'm a big NCIS fan and bought the 10th Season because I have the other 9 Seasons.  Even though I have all 10 Seasons I still watch it whenever its on.  So being the fan that I am, when the 11th Season is on DVD, I'll buy it also.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|My son loves this game.  Keeps him occupied with all the mini games and a great way for us to both to pass the time.
1616550414|3.0|I just received the book and am amazed at the wealth of knowledge contained in it. However, when I turn to the Chronology of Hyrule section, pages 69-72 (a single sheet four-page spread) fell out. I'm pretty sad about this, but don't know that it's worth the hassle of exchanging.<br /><br />Update: The surround pages fell out as well, so I have processed an exchange with Amazon. Once I receive the new copy, I will again update my review.
B000002I53|4.0|Has the above subject recordong been released on CD yet?  I noticed in your advertising it shows a classic on CD??????  I am very interested in puschasing the One-Night Stand A Keyboard Event on CD.  I already have the original album.<br /><br />Please avise.<br /><br />Thank you, Joe McClinton
B009329Y30|5.0|Another great love story by Nicholas Sparks!! This is a great story line with surprises and the actors are great. This adds to my favorites, Dear John, The Notebook and The Last Song.
B008QTV3X0|1.0|I know this show was rated TV-MA, but this was closer to a NC17 rating. It has borderline soft-core porn, several frontal nudity shots per episode with several very graphic sex scenes. I wish I could have been warned. I have watched TV-MA before, but this show is really bad.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My son loved this movie we all watched it as a family and us adults even liked it. It actually has a very good story line teaching kids about pollution. And very fun as with most Dr. Seuss.
B004T340QY|5.0|Amazing little story with clever writing, great humor, wonderful acting, and amazing cinematics! It makes you wonder why more films with a setting in the South aren't made.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I definitely recommend this book to my friends! I can't wait until I see the movie! Great read! Highly recommend it!
B00A9C3RNQ|1.0|We bought this for movie night at our Club House in February. Since it is not here yet,  I will revlew later. Mike
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Being one of the great classics nothing less was expected from the book. It delivers a great literary experience. The meandering philosophical interludes in the narrative provide food for thought for readers of all kinds. It is both entertaining and heartening. A must read for all who are interested in classic literature!
B005K17RU0|3.0|Wish it gave the rain chances on the hourly otherwise pretty good. Fart fart fart fart fart fart fart fart!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Loved this game!!  Graphics are amazing.  I did not want the game to end.  I have purchased other games and have been disappointed.  I go back to Big Fish every time.  If you haven’t tried any of the Big Fish games, you are missing out on some great fun.  I am looking forward to Enigmatis: The Ghosts of Maple Creek II.  Hope to see it soon.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I love this show! I have a few more to watch out of this season and then I will be caught up to start watching on TV every week! :) (Spoiler) I was kind of disappointed that they didn't get shipped back to their land when the curse broke but we will see what the writers can do with this story! Good so far!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Turns my phone into a kindle pretty much which I already have a kindle so it makes them extremely interactive, which is actually kinda cool. The app came with my phone so I? Didn't purchase it, wouldn't have either but that's just because I already have a kindle.  App works though.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great weather app. Fast and easy and cool.  The best way to get the weather even when I don't like it.
B009XWD02G|1.0|Didn't read other's reviews on this abortion before we downloaded and installed it.  Won't ever do that again!  Tried it, it failed, we read the reviews then. Couldn't wait to uninstall it. No wonder it's free.  It's gone, thanks to the relevant guidance provided by AMAZON as to how to go about deleting it.  Was easy to do on the latest FIRE tablet once the guidance gave us a hint as to how to go about it.  We're amateurs at this stuff so we need all the help we can get.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I did have a hard time getting interested in this book when I first started reading it. After the first few chapters this book grabbed my attention and I couldn't put it down. The story line threw me and I would have never imagined what happened took place. I finished the book in 2 days and IT WAS AWESOME!!!!!!!  I would highly recommend this book.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|my grandson rates this game 5 stars he really enjoys it. now I have to get him his own kindle so I can use mine.
0439023521|5.0|I could not put this book down.  I read this book in less than two days.  And then read it again.  Great series.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|This is a quality show that keeps one completely involved.  We are always disappointed when an episode is over.  We enjoy the a glimpse of history with this show.
B004G600A4|5.0|Love this movie.  The kids and I thought it was very cute and funny.  Even the boys want to watch it again!
B009329Y30|3.0|We felt the movie was very predictable.  It seemed to have a fairly week plot that just didn't seem believable.
0439023513|5.0|I think everyone should read this series.  A lot of great themes with government, loyalty, right vs. wrong, and a little bit of action/adventure and romance thrown in.
1881273377|5.0|This book changed our lives. I have the audiobook too just to help me brush up every once in awhile...  The paper book has the quiz to identify you and your spouses love languages.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I don't know why, but it surprised me when I read a book in less than three days. I used to read books really quickly, but life got in the way, and now I'm lucky if I finish a book a week.<br /><br />That being said, I read this one in about three days. I was sucked in from the start and I couldn't wait to see how it ended. I was immediately drawn to Katie, and her story as to why she would run away from her life. Based on the trailers for the new movie coming out (Starring Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel), I thought she'd killed someone. Luckily, that wasn't really the case.<br /><br />I loved the world that Nicholas Sparks put together. I loved the people in the town, and I especially loved Katie's little cottage that she turned into her own home (I seriously want a little cottage of my own now!). I thought the town sounded wonderful, I thought the characters were believable, and the inner voices of each character (Katie, Alex and Kevin) definitely added to the story. There was Katie's fear, Alex's curiosity and Kevin's seriously messed up head.<br /><br />I've never thought to get inside the head of an abuser (Honestly, watching \\"Criminal Minds\\" gives me the heebie jeebies!), and the way Kevin used the Bible as an excuse for beating Katie was deplorable. People who use the Bible like that make me sick.<br /><br />It's been a long time since I'd read a Nicholas Sparks book, and this was a good one to get back into it. Loved it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Thanks to the quick download on Kindle I was able to start reading this shortly after completing the Hunger Games. I thought that the story might be predictable but I'm 3/4 through and this is not the case. A good read, and I'm looking forward to book three.
B007IK44CK|5.0|Of course the tools and gadgets are far fetched, or are they?  Hmmmn  Makes you wonder what you don't know won't hurt you.  Bar none the best so far.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was my first Kindle purchase.  It has been years since I had time for recreational reading and I couldn't put it down.  I saw the film on a whim, but really, really enjoyed the book.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|This is my favorite movie version of Jane Austen's &#34;Persuasion.&#34;  Some have criticized the ending where Ann runs to meet Captain Wentworth.  They say Jane Austen never would have placed such behavior in her novel.  Maybe so, but it perfectly demonstrates what Ann was feeling at that moment.
B002QKZLZ6|3.0|This case is just okay.  It does give some protection to the headset (I bought it mostly to protect the earpiece which it does) but it would have been much better if it was a hard plastic shell case that was molded to fit perfectly around the headset - Which I think should come standard with a high-end earpiece, but I digress...
B005IZLPKQ|3.0|What is it these days that everything has to be laced with foul langauge?  Otherwise, this would have been a very uplifting, thoroughly enjoyable, very patriotic movie.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|it was nice to be able to show my grand daughter the stage version. She has seen the movie and memorized the songs from the CD. She has been Christine Daae several of her 6 years of life for Halloween.  Of Course, she fell even more in love with the theatrical stage version. Truly a must have for any Phantom lover!
B003274QH6|5.0|Its a pretty good tv show. If you haven't given it a chance, you should! Its pretty awesome. The price is also fair.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|It works perfectly well at gigabit speed, and flawless Windows 8 installation.<br />Good quality in materials. No more to say, for just a Network interface Card. If you are looking for gigabit speeds in a wired-nic-less ultrabook, you can pull the trigger with comfidence.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is great.  Owning a real horse is expensive, so this is a way to have some fun for free.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|cute game. good graphics. had to un install and re install because it stopped loading. luckily it restored my progress.
B002QE3CTY|3.0|Not a bad  book, just weird. At time it seems as if it wasn't planned  out all the way through from the beginning and was written a  they went along. Good enough to  m  to give the the the next book in the series a chance.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|My kids love this game and will not put it down. Was worth the purchase when they are that entertained!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Cool app for horse lovers I love it so does my brother. Good.you should get . So much fun for a free app!!!!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|my ratings are because I really enjoyed the book , I found the read easy to follow .<br />Waking up Married is a great story
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It's really fun but I like temple run better because u can swipe faster although there is ziplines and cheaper players it's still cool!!!I love it!!:p
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|Makes the viewer wish there was a bit of a poet in everyone.  Rodriguez approaches life with a simple, unassuming joy.  It's infectious.
B00280LYHS|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read.  I can not wait for the movie to come to theaters!!
B007XF4J70|5.0|I will not devote my review to the movie itself, for I can't believe that anyone reading this has never seen the movie. Rather I will deal with the quality of the transfer to blu-ray. I own the two disc Special Edition dvd version of Casablanca and I could not believe how great it looked on my blu-ray player. Well, after purchasing the blu-ray edition of this movie and watching it on my blu-ray player, I was blown away! The quality of the transfer to blu-ray is beyond belief. The images literally pop off the screen! In addition, the blu-ray has all the special features of the dvd and some extras; such as, Michael Curtiz: The Greatest Director You Never Heard Of. If you don't already own this blu-ray version of Casablanca, run, don't walk, and purchase it. You will most definitely not be sorry.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I really liked this game, even though it was somewhat harder than the first edition. Overall, bravo, IMangi Studios, for creating such a great sequel to a legacy!!!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I highly recommend it, especially if you love music.  It was funny, entertaining and the music was fabulous!  You won't be dissappointed.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun for a boring day at work muahaha. I suggest it tod anyone who enjoys classic arcade type games. have fun
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great to be able to 'catch up'... I had missed the season opener, so enjoyed the opportunity to see it before the next episodes were aired....
B006C3Q6GG|5.0|&#34;What a weird thing for a woman to be so fond of&#34;.  I've heard that a few times, and yes, there is a very specific target audience for these books.  I have the Kindle edition which provides the benefit of highlighting terms I'm not familiar with and giving a definition. I've always been fascinated with this period in history, and seeing the movie loosely based on the novels a few years ago only cemented my interest. They certainly aren't for everyone, but if this is your thing, it will be YOUR thing.  I'm hooked and can't quite tell whether or not I'm more enamoured with Jack or Stephen.  My husband has a great deal of knowledge and interest in this same subject so they've provided a lot of common ground for discussion.  I tried reading the CS Forrester books and other authors of this genre and find the character developement by O'Brian highly superior.
0394818237|4.0|A very high quality version of an old classic. The illustrations will fascinate a child for hours! Just be advised this is a revised (shortened) edition of the original version. As some other internet reviews explain, a couple of chapters/stories have been left out of the newer editions. You can find original editions (used) for sale, but at much higher cost compared to this version. For most children, who have never seen the original, this version is great fun and they will never miss the removed material. If you are buying a copy only for nostalgic purposes then find an old original, pay a collector's price and enjoy. Otherwise, the new edition is just fine for most any young reader!
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I loved the book on my new Kendle. It was a great free book. I plan on getting many more soon.
B009RI4FRU|2.0|Awesome set design, funny costumes, beautiful soundtrack, nice key turns from solid actors like Bill Murray...the only thing missing is a screenplay and direction that makes you give a damn about the story and people in it.
B00B70M23A|3.0|This is probably the biggest tear jerker episode. Childbirth is an intense time, even in today's modern world one never knows the outcome.  I look forward to the future episodes.  I love PBS.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|I couldn't get through the first 20 minutes of this. A cheap Family Guy knock off that maybe your 8 year old kid will find appealing...if he is immature for his age.
B000FBJHEO|5.0|Excellent book. I have read it a couple of times to get the layers in the story.  I recommend it if you want to read something a little different.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i love timple run 2 and timple run 1  i love all timple run peiord point  blank and why becouse its fun
B008BM0IUG|5.0|Sean Carroll has the ability to explain complicated science in understandable ways! This book doesn't rely on complicated mathematical formulas but instead uses analogies to everyday things that we can actually see. While these analogies are likely not as precise an explanation as math, they are understandable.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless kept me questioning all the way through of what it really was about!  I feel that for all purposes that I bought this book I was given great reading.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I love this but I really hate how complicated it is to get powerups and stuff now and the course is a lot more complicated. I do love the graphics and new course but I definetly like the first one better.
B005LAII0I|4.0|yes, it is a good story except at the very last part where they start to roll the credits  the dvd started flipping out other than that I very much enjoyed this new & modern fairy tale
B000PAAH3K|3.0|Gladwell tells some interesting vignettes where intuitive decisions were more accurate than analytic ones.  He also tells stories where analytic thinking is better than intuitive.  However, he does a poor job of pulling together a framework for when you should use each, or how one can develop accurate intuitive decision-making.<br /><br />So the book seems incomplete.
B0038ZITHK|4.0|Great movie, I used to watch it on Netflix...but it was removed, so i bought the bluray.  Nice to have and pop it in when I wanna see it!  Classic!
B004I744AS|5.0|Seems great so far. I haven't had a chance to use it much, but when I did it was helpful.
B0061S073A|5.0|This let me give my kindle fire to my 2 year old without worrying about him buying stuff or getting into apps that are not for him. I added books and games for him into the program and he uses them. If I click home it won't let me exit, redirects me back to the program until I manually click exit and enter my pin. Love this and love that it's free. :)
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Help you to identify what you like vs. what your spouse or children like.  everyone needs love in different ways.
B004UJAOLM|3.0|This is a true Gothic novel, dark and filled with evil.  I found the hate and vengeful acts just overwhelming.  That said, it is well written and complex.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Great movie! Really gives insight to that illness and the ability to overcome it. Russell Crowe did an awesome job!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I really like the game and I've had it for a couple days but pretty often it freezes up and force closes when I die and try to use the Save Me option. Anyone else have this problem?
B004XZR63M|5.0|This book is easy reading yet with simple profound truth. Will give you a whole new insight on things never really taught in school on finances, but not limited to just finances. look forward to getting the rest of the series.
B009CG2YDE|5.0|This game is so much fun ! Reminds me of the good old days !!!  LOL ! I'd like to get more games like this. 8^)
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|A little bit of something for everyone. My children loved it and my husband couldn't stop laughing which always makes me enjoy it more :)
B000YHG72E|5.0|I love this movie! It's cute, fun, and family friendly. I think this is quickly becoming my favorite holiday movie.
0988262592|4.0|Main Idea - IT can use known intellectual capital from manufacturing to drive business centric work to incredibly short cycle times.  This book displays a vision for what is being marketed as The Dev-Ops Movement; that is blending development and operations appropriately to create true agility for a market driven IT shop.<br /><br />Summary - The book follows the career of Bill, one of the IT Ops Managers for a billion dollar auto parts manufacturer/distributor/retailer.  He is promoted to VP of IT after the two execs above him are fired.  The first chapters of the book demonstrate all the bad service, terrible development practices, and daily fires that are present in a \\"normal shop.\\"<br /><br />Bill is introduced to Erik, a board candidate who has run major improvement efforts in one of the company's manufacturing plants and since moved on to become a consulting guru in all things improvement including IT. Erik mentors Bill in \\"the Three Ways:\\"<br /><br />1) The First Way shows us how to create fast flow of  work as it moves from Development into IT Operations<br />2) The Second Way shows us how to shorten and amplify feedback loops so we can fix quality at the source and avoid rework<br />3) The Third Way shows us how to create a culture the simultaneously fosters experimentation, learning from failure, and understanding that repetition and practice are the prerequisites to mastery.<br /><br />Bill, with Erik's occasional enigmatic input, goes on to improve and control the flow of work using his key resources as gates for feeding more WIP into IT, aligning IT with key business metrics, and turning his shop into a \\"game changer,\\" capable of turning deployments with quality, security, and all the other \\"ilites\\" taken into consideration and ops controls being added as part of the IT product designs - very cool.  This is done through bundling of environments as part of a release packages and using virtual and cloud technologies to automate deployment and test of build packages in minutes instead of weeks.  With the constraints of setups and testing being reduced, work can be reduced to one-piece-flows (smaller sets of requirements) which reduced the build, test, and deployment times.  All of this of course assumes a great deal in terms intellectual capital and technology but in the book, they are able to reuse scripting and know how they adapt from the Phoenix Project; their $20m 2.5 years in the making, last stab at survival.<br /><br />Thoughts - The improvement theories are sound but do require leadership understanding and commitment.  The ideas are excellent adaptations of Theory of Constraints, Lean, Six Sigma, and ITIL.  For shops without the in-house expertise of the improvement techniques and technologies involved, the road will be somewhat longer.  The authors through their characters assert that this mode of operating will eventually become the new normal and is required for survival.  I totally agree.  Like most meaningful business changes, they are simple but not simplistic requiring, hard work, focus, determination, and careful thought.  This book is descriptive and is to be followed by the proscriptive DEV/OPS Cookbook.<br /><br />The one \\"buyer beware\\" I have to a universal endorsement for this this book is it's occasionally strong language.  (A few F bombs, 41 s***, 32 Godd**ns  -  gotta love search capability in Kindle)  While some may reason that this reflects the reality of their environment, it will be off putting to many as offensive or unprofessional rendering it \\"unfit\\" to share in their work cultures.  The book is important and a worthy and worthwhile read which I endorse; however, I fear the authors have limited their market and sphere of influence though their use of profanity.  If you are in an environment where the language is unacceptable and you can read it with clear conscience, consider creating a summary for your team.<br /><br />As a companion to this book, I would highly encourage that readersdigest a copy of The Goal. (Dr. E.M. Goldratt) and its sequel, It's Not Luck.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|A favorite for my family. We love this movie! Great to watch all year round and to remember to believe!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|The game is fun and addicting just like the first. However, it is really buggy and kind of hard to control. I have to turn my kindle almost all the way on its side to keep from falling off cliffs or rails. The graphics are awesome and the game sounds great. I love the level system and the power ups/abilities. I like that the game isn't extremely hard and has a casual gaming feel to it.
B008Q09K2U|4.0|I thought the ending was a bit of an anticlimax but thoroughly enjoyed the book, it was fast moving and relevant to current events
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Not as comprehensive with respect to the decisions AmazonKindle makes about approved book content as I wish it had been. Beginning authors like myself require more hand-holding than is included here, but a good start on how to conform to technical aspects of writing for AmazonKindle.
B008NMT684|5.0|i didnt know if my 2 year oldwould be able to do this but after about 5 minutes of working rogether he got it just fine and really enjoyed playing. a varietyof puzzle styles ang cutepi<br />cs.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Cool games<br />Good graphics I would like to see . More of these games I do not to have to spend more money on these games
B009VYF5E2|5.0|I'm a fantasy fan and a romantic at heart and the BBC series &#34;Merlin&#34; really hits the spot.  I also have the the first 3 seasons and never tire of watching them over and over.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|This story kept me wanting more of the series!!!  I have a hard time finding books to hold my attention!  This series hits the nail on the head!
B008QTVNUI|3.0|My expectations were extremely high going in. Word of mouth reviews from close friends and acclaim from critics were on a level unheard of since Breaking Bad, Friday Night Lights, The Wire and Lost.<br /><br />However, unlike those other shows, this is the only one that failed miserably in coming close to living up to the billing.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a glorified soap opera that centers around never ending character development with very unoriginal plot twists. Proponents of the show claim that unlike \\"24\\", \\"Homeland\\" aims to be much more of a psychological thriller than a cliff hanger heart racer. This is not a problem for dramas like Mad Men or Boardwalk Empire which lack a consistent underlying stressful theme, but for a show that sells itself to the audience as one in which \\"everyone is in constant danger\\" the lack of action is disappointing. Instead of daring action sequences, the audience just gets hit with more and more characters crying and complaining about their lives.<br /><br />Those that like this show clearly become enamored with the personalities of the characters themselves. At no point did I reach this level. I honestly got to the point where I couldn't care less what happened to the characters played by Claire Danes and Damian Lewis. The lack of a true protagonist leaves the audience directionless and unfortunately makes the plot twists much less exciting.<br /><br />Further, the plot twists in this series are not very original anyways. Almost all of these \\"Pro/Anti American Terrorist Plot\\" themes were played out by the likes of \\"24\\" and \\"Air Force One\\" among others. Again, at no point was I on the edge of my seat just dying to see what was going to happen in the next episode.<br /><br />Trust me I fully get that this show was not intended to be a \\"24\\" spinoff, but you simply can't replicate the exact same theme yet ask the audience to have different expectations. \\"Breaking Bad\\" had an almost identical theme to \\"Weeds\\" but the writers were able to brilliantly differentiate it while still maintaining the same level of excitement. People that are buying into this show should be cognizant of that discrepancy here and adjust their expectations accordingly.<br /><br />Out of respect for my friends' opinions, I sat through and finished the first season. I passed on the second season and simply resorted to reading the episode recaps on Wikipedia. I am happy I did instead of investing another 12 hours of my life forcing myself to care about what happens to the supposed protagonists.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Great acting<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Very unoriginal plot lines<br />- Purported \\"cliff hangers\\" and \\"game changers\\" did not follow through in terms of resulting excitement level<br />- Constant character development<br />- Lack of a true protagonist that the audience can care for or relate to<br />- Drawn out emotional sequences
B00A4FOWYQ|4.0|Before HEARTTHROB, Tegan and Sara's 2009 album marked the biggest change in the band's sound.  The band's sound was much more streamlined than it had ever been before, and HEARTTHROB continues this trend.  This record is, for better or worse, more produced, more streamlined, and more electronic than anything Tegan and Sara have ever done before.  For those keeping track of these kinds of things, SAINTHOOD was a very split album: the songs penned by Sara were much more electronic and melodic (\\"Alligator\\", \\"Night Watch,\\" \\"Red Belt\\") and Tegan's output was more in the vein of power-pop and alternative rock (\\"Hell,\\" \\"Northshore,\\" \\"The Ocean\\").  This time around, the distance between these songwriters has closed, and now, it's difficult to tell who has written what.  Even though this makes for a more cohesive record in the end, it comes at the cost of the variety and surprise that many of the past records had.<br /><br />The album opens with its lead single, \\"Closer.\\"  \\"Closer\\" is a good, solid, catchy tune, and it's filled with many of the twin-on-twin harmonies that has become a hallmark for the band.  The song lays the harmonies, electronic percussion, and synthesizers on nice and thick.  Chris Walla (who produced the previous two albums and guitar player for Death Cab for Cutie) has been replaced with a small handful of other producers.  Greg Kurstin picks up the bulk of the production work here - known for his work with Sia, Kylie Minogue, Pink, and Kelly Clarkson - and he definitely leaves his mark on the duo's sound.  \\"Closer\\" sets the tone for the rest of the album: it's heavily melodic, but underneath all of the shiny production, there's a well of heartache that Tegan and Sara have used for inspiration.<br /><br />For me, this album doesn't completely work.  Before this album, I've enjoyed each new album more than the previous one.  HEARTTHROB isn't bad - it's surely better than most electronic-pop music out there - but it doesn't come close to the heights of SAINTHOOD or THE CON.  The best predictor of whether or not you'll like this album lies in your reaction to the lead single \\"Closer.\\"  If you loved any of the band's previous albums, you might hate this one, but you might also go crazy for it - it all depends on what you enjoyed most about the band. Either way, listen to this album a few times before making up your mind on it.<br /><br />Recommend tracks to sample/download: \\"Closer,\\" \\"How Come You Don't Want Me,\\" \\"Love They Say\\"INTHOOD or THE CON.

B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Very easy to find what I was looking for on Google I always use it on my cell phone would recommend it to anyone.
0307887448|5.0|I just loved this books.  It reminded me of the fun I had growing up programming computers and playing computer games.  I am a geek and proud.  If you love technology and it's development over the last 40 years, you will love this books.  If computers make you feel uneasy, you probably won't enjoy this so much.
B001782N4A|3.0|This is a review for the product only, not the vendor, the product was gifted to me.<br /><br />Pros: It looks pretty cool, and does basically what I thought it would do: the ports work for my flash drives and my drawing tablet. The cord is really long.<br /><br />Cons: It feels pretty cheap, the noises it makes are way too loud so I just have it on silent. The ports can't provide much power apparently, so if you're plugging something like an iphone charger in it won't charge your phone. Sometimes it doesn't read other flash drives (I've brought it in for my students to upload work). It's bigger than I expected.<br /><br />Perhaps a decent gift for someone that is obsessed with Star Wars, otherwise it's a bit disappointing.
B00006CXSS|4.0|DVD's were in great shape but the box showed a little wear although that's not what is/was important.  We're looking forward to watching the whole series, thank you!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a sit on the edge of your seat series! This is a must see show! Can't wait to see all of season 3!!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|What a handy little tool....I can make a note and stick it right on my laptop face without any sticky glue and it stays right there to remind me of things and never gets lost...how great is that!
B001NOQI3U|5.0|What a joy to have this movie on DVD.  I enjoyed the bonus tour of the eastern European town as well as the scenes and songs that were cut.  Also could not believe how much clearer and sharper the DVD is.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|So addictive and talk about fun.  I recommend it for everyone and like a rollercoaster ride, get ready for a trip of a life time.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This rocks it has many features like zippline and carts i love it Highly recommended  Best app EVER love it could rate it 1 million stars if I  could!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love it,it is great to know how to take care of a horse it is awlsome because you get to groom it, it show responseablety
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is  fun and amusing. It it a tricky mind puzzles. I rate this game a high five stars.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This was a fun game with a scary twist. Fun and creepy.<br />Good graphics. I liked it a lot. I recommend this game.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|An excellent book.  Plot is good.  Action is slow at times.<br />Characters are believable and well managed.  Main character always seems to come up with the right help and message last second.  Believable...eh???
B0076DELIG|3.0|This book was an enjoyable read but disappointing for a Harry Bosch novel. Harry's relationship with his daughter was way too phony.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I liked this book because there were great characters and good details. My favorite was Glinda because she helped Dorothy and her friends get back to where they wanted to live. The wizard was not a wizard, but I liked him. He was smart. This was a good book. I wonder, if there could be a sequel, which there probably won't, what would happen. Hmmmmmmm.........
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game should be illegal because it is so addictive.  I think many hours of work are lost because of  this game.
B007OWRBJK|4.0|After listening to The Who and Pete Townsend's solo works for over 35 years, it has been an interesting journey to read what the circumstances were that shaped the band and the composer that drives it. While he does seem overly self-indulgent at times, Pete is also introspective, insightful, and witty. What a great read!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Everything about the orginal and more to love. The game is even a bit more difficult, so if you got really good at the first, the second will still challenge you. Excellent game, especially for free.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I think this game is amazing. Defiantly keeps me occupied. It seems to be very addictive as well. J Judith Couric
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game, barely if no adds and its FREE! You should get it. Very fun with more features and better than the first one.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great series.  Love the interaction of characters.  Also the rich are characterized as being somewhat normal.  About as normal as the rest of us except for the fact they have more money.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|The Killing Floor:<br /><br />I consider all Jack Reacher books top ratings. The Killing Floor is Well Written, and holds my interest.
B0007OASII|5.0|in my opinion. Its sad that after this CD Kahn left (for good reasons). I hear the new guy is good too. Anyway, my brother turned me onto these guys. A few ok songs but most of it rocks. Def worth the price.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|cannot wait for how they wrap this up.  i have thoruoughly enjoyed and will most certainly miss the series when it goes.
B003HLM2QO|5.0|at least I hope he's not just lip-synching. This is a good solid fun interesting alot of times-deep heavy Ozzy CD with another great guitarist!
B007I2BYX0|4.0|The new songs on this ep are great , and the old live ones are done very well. Just makes you want to hear the whole new cd whenever it comes out :)
B000TGQDZQ|4.0|Beautiful voice, great music, good writing. However, the symphonic aspects get a little, little, bit old to quick sometimes. Word.  (they said i needed one more Word)
0800141660|4.0|The story is timeless and true to the original novel.  I can watch this movie over and over!!  I would recommend it to all.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|This is an excellent film that covers an amazing story that is hard to forget. And it is great to be introduced to the music.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|My topic title tells everything. Very catchy and I'm fine with it. Not my favorite artist but I kind of like the song.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book. I could not put this book down and I highly reccomend this book. This was one of those books I stayed up late into the night reading.
0307346617|2.0|I bought this knowing the layout of &#34; interviews&#34; with the survivors, but jeez after 200 pages of repetitive stories it gets a bit much, they are basically short stories ,some good - most of which unfortunately aren't,  Then you realize there are still 100 plus pages left! This book just wasn't as entertaining as I hoped and with no real main character you don't really get involved with the story. Each interview is roughly 4 pages each and by the time you develop a feel for the character it's over. It's a bit over hyped I think and honestly I have been forcing myself to try and finish it for the last 3 weeks but I just can't do it. I'm stuck on page 220 and I'm afraid I won't be able to make myself read the rest. I wanted to love this book but in all honesty i just don't find it entertaining. Guess i Need more story than interviews or maybe Brooks writing style isn't as good as everyone is saying.
B00A6HHJ9C|3.0|i cannot put my finger on it, i have listened to this cd several times,it just not as good as the previous cd's , but i still love luke, he is a great artist, i think he should take a little more time in between cd's. i am still a loyal fan, maybe the cd will grow on me.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Much more involved than the first game...more challenging... great graphics too....Very good game...give it a try you'll enjoy it. Thanks for the game.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|I bate how many minecraft rip offset that are trying to be passed off as the real game. this is one of those ripoffs. Nowhere near as good as minecraft pocket edition. Cost me $7 to buy the real thing, but I don't have to put up withthis garbage anymore.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|just what i needed - hoping it will not peel as the previous one did - looks like the same material
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is a great sound machine app for the kindle, and I must say it is the best app I have bought yet. One thing I would like to see this app have are more guitar or solo instrument sounds. Overall, great app!
B000OCXI3K|5.0|thoroughly engaging - reads easily, interesting plot with a surprise ending. Can be read in one easy sitting or a few by the fire.
B004EPYZPS|3.0|A little far-fetched, with kids out in the middle of the night trying to film a video and stumbling onto a government conspiracy. Not a flim you'd want to watch twice, but it all turns out OK.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|I got this for my husband for Christmas, he loves it very much! But, of course, that depends on if you like this band or not.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan's incredible voice and expression comes through in this album better than I've ever heard her before. What a gift! Two duets with Donny Osmond and one with Michael Crawford are highlights. You will be glad you bought this CD.
B0014DW3OS|5.0|How can you go wrong with Denzel??!<br />Movie was rented from amazon and beside the loading every 15 minutes it was great, but i would bet that was my Internet signal.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's realistic and has a lot a detail I really like it for a free app it is really cool and not a let down at all
0783229526|5.0|This movie is incredibly good, but you have to pay attention! The package was in perfect condition, no scratches whatsoever!<br />I recommend this product.
B007SGM084|5.0|I couldn't put them down.  They were very erotic and enlightening. I was sad when they ended. I wanted more!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved this book.  I thought it was well written and I loved the characters!  Great story line!  This is my first Stephen King book.
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|Dear Music Appreciators,<br /><br />One of the pleasures of reviewing music for the past year and a half has been discovering new bands - but in my case it has been less a case of discovering NEW bands, as discovering bands that are new to me.  Apparently Tegan and Sara have been around since the 90's.  Didn't know that.  I'd heard OF them but I'd never really HEARD them.<br /><br />But let's dispense with the usual summary/description/analysis stuff and simply say a few words in favor of this record in the hope that you'll decide to hear it for yourself:<br /><br />I was working on another review of a more serious sounding and self-important indie rock release, and although the record was pretty good, I was having trouble focusing.  I decided to take a break and try Tegan and Sara's new dancey pop record HEARTTHROB instead.  Bingo.  Suddenly listening to music was fun again and I didn't have to work so hard to like what I was hearing.  If some albums are like eating your vegetables and some albums are like eating your fruit, then I would say HEARTTHROB is a nice juicy peach.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Constant Listener
B000NY12LO|4.0|I enjoyed the book but I i didn't really think the ending was very well written. Overall, it was okay.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I have been a Twitter fan for quite a few years & this app is great to keep up with my contacts & keep tweeting
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so amazing! If you think Temple Run was fun, I recommend you getting this app! It's free and really fun!

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this app daily. I use a daily devo plan for short readings & time with God, but also use the Bible for scripture readings. You can get any version you prefer. Great to have for mobile use! I highly recommend this app!
B006VFLIYK|3.0|I like the author, I've read many of his books<br />I gave it three stars because it held my interest.<br />I would recommend it to friends.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|I bought this book based on reviews here at Amazon, and it did not disappoint! So many business books are about philosophy and general ideas. This book actually walks you through the process of testing your startup ideas, step-by-step. FINALLY! I immediately started testing some ideas I've been working on, using the \\"Lean Canvas\\", and it was easy to spot which ideas are worth my time moving forward. I just bought the book a week ago, and already it's probably saved me 40+ hours of work and at least a few hundred dollars (putting work into flawed ideas). That's darn good ROI.
B00633W614|5.0|This is  part of a trilogy and I have read the first two. The third has not been published but I will be reading it as soon as it is. I really enjoyed this book and plan to read more by Jeffrey Archer. I hope others are as good as this.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. it feels like I'm actually taking care if this horse and its awesome. I love it

This is a very convincing account of near a death experience by an avowed sceptic before the experience. If you have any doubt about the hereafter, read this book.

B00138H0H4|5.0|Having heard THE STORY being played at the end of a movie I recently watched, I fell in love with the lyrics, the voice and the music.  This prompted me to purchase the CD (by downloading it I had the music immediately).  THE STORY being my favorite piece on the CD, I must say that the music on the entire CD is beautiful.  Brandi has such an unusual voice which, for me, is calming and enjoyable.  I highly recommend this CD.

B006P0FICE|5.0|The story in this movie was inspired by Dumas' The Three Musketeers.  I say inspired because the story has been changed.  Dumas' characters are there, the period is right, but this is not the same story that Alexandre Dumas wrote.  Don't let that turn you off.  This is a fun movie to watch.  Quite frankly, the original story needed to be modified for the modern audience anyway.<br /><br />The story begins in Venice where we find our Musketeers on a mission to steal Leonardo DaVinci's engineering plans for a flying ship.  Unfortunately, they are not the only ones who are interested in the plans.  The English are also interested in building a fleet of flying ships in order to have the capability to invade their rival nations.  The trio successfully disable the guards and evade the security traps to the vault.  Now in possession of the document, the group then decides to make their escape.  A short time later, Milady DeWinter betrays them and steals the document, delivering it to their English rival, the Duke of Buckingham.<br /><br />Fast forward six months.  Relationship between France and England have deteriorated.  To take advantage of this, Cardinal Richeleu wants to trigger a war between the two nations, hoping to take the throne from the king during the resulting chaos.  DeWinter, who works as a double-agent, steals the Queen's prized necklace and plants false evidence pointing to a romantic relationship between the Queen and Buckingham.  The Cardinal, hoping this would force France's young King Louis XIII into declaring a war with England, manipulates the monarch into testing the Queen's fidelity.  The necklace, a gift from the king, was taken to England by DeWinter.  Richeleu manipulates the king into thinking that the Queen had given the necklace to Buckingham, as a sign of affection.  To test the Queen, King Louis decides to hold a ball.  He then specifically instructs the Queen to wear the necklace to the dance.  Constance, the beautiful lady-in-waiting to the Queen, makes a desperate plea to the young D'Artagnan to recover the necklace in time for the ball.  D'Artagnan and the three musketeers agree to sneak their way into England and steal the necklace from the tower of London.  The date of the ball is only five days away.<br /><br />The Musketeers, now four in number, retrieve the necklace and steals one of Buckingham's flying ships along the way.  The Cardinal, not one to be easily discouraged, sends his henchman, Rochefort, to intercept the musketeers on their way back to France.  With an improved flying boat of his own, Rochefort confronts the musketeers and forces young D'Artagnan to give up the necklace.<br /><br />Logan Lerman heads the all-star cast, playing D'Artagnan.  Milla Jovovich, Mads Mikkelsen, Matthew MacFadyen, Orlando Bloom, Luke Evans, Ray Stevenson, Juno Temple, Freddie Fox, Christoph Waltz, and the very beautiful Gabriella Wilde round out the supporting roles.  I would have to say that all were great in their respective parts.  Particularly Orlando Bloom as the very arrogant Duke of Buckingham.  Gabriella Wilde is just breathtakingly beautiful as Constance, the love interest of D'Artagnan.  Paul W.S. Anderson, Milla's husband, directed the movie.<br /><br />This is a fun movie to watch, blending flashy action and light comedy into a very watchable story.  The terrific cast is what made the movie work.  There are a lot of elements here that have been changed from the original story.  And this is unlike any of the other previous movies made from the source material.  Let's just say this movie was inspired by the original material from Dumas, but has a story all its own.  In other words, the original story has been given the Paul W.S. Anderson treatment.  I highly recommend this movie.the Queen, makes a desperate plea to the young D'Artagnan to recover the necklace in time for the ball.

B0090SI3ZW|4.0|I just had to comment on this movie, me and my 19 year old son ,went to the movie theater to see this movie. I'm a fan of marshal art & action pack movies. We loved this movie and the story line. I'm a fan of all the artistes and actors in the movie. Now for  the people ,that had nothing but bad comments to say.  Why did you even go see the movie,if you didn't want to see blood & action? Really.. My personal opinion, is people that write these comments  half of  the time, have not even seen  the movies and going off, the media opinion only. This was a great movie and cannot wait,until it is released.

B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This was a better movie than I expected - not because I thought the other Marvel movies were weak, but because they were pretty good and I figured they would have jumped the shark by now on the Iron Man thing.  No, this is action packed from the get go, laugh out loud funny at times, and the characters were believable and properly cast.  I enjoyed this a lot and would watch it again - which is saying a lot for me.

B00AU2B0DE|2.0|[[ASIN:B00AU2B0DE Believe Acoustic]] arrives in 2013, likely aimed at tiding over Justin Bieber's fans until his new studio effort materializes.  The main problem with Believe Acoustic is that the concept nor the album itself seems to suit a youthful pop star like Bieber.  Throughout the effort, Bieber often overdoes the vocal runs, trying to compensate for a lack of full production; he accompanied either by acoustic guitars or piano.  The results are as expected - mediocre overall.<br /><br />\\"Boyfriend\\" holds up surprisingly well under acoustic treatment, perhaps because it was a huge hit for the pop star. With pros come cons and the cons of \\"Boyfriend\\" as ultimately its ridiculous songwriting which includes references to Buzz Lightyear and fondue.  Even so, \\"As Long As You Love Me\\" is clumsier as Bieber sounds rhythmically lethargic on the \\"l-l-l-love me\\" lyrics at times and clumsy covering Big Sean's rap verse vocally.  \\"Beauty and a Beat\\" follows, but seems even more ill-suited to ever be considered an acoustic offering.<br /><br />\\"She Don't Like The Lights\\" helps to redeem the set, yielding sound acoustic guitar accompaniment and solid vocals by Bieber. \\"Take You\\" seems almost redundant, given the original's prominent use of acoustic guitar.  \\"Be Alright\\", a less memorable cut from [[ASIN:B007VT6QSI Believe [Deluxe Edition]]] fails to stand out here in acoustic form. \\"All Around the World\\", the opener for the parent album, similarly garners no more love acoustically. Finally, \\"Fall [Live]\\" finds Bieber overindulging in vocal runs to atone for the cut's blas&eacute; nature.  Of the originals receiving acoustic treatment, \\"Boyfriend\\" and \\"She Don't Like The Lights\\" fare best.<br /><br />\\"Yellow Raincoat\\" is one of three new cuts.  Bieber sings it in hushed manner and while his subtlety is appreciated, it does little to reinvigorate momentum for this rather boring affair.  \\"I Would\\" has similarities in sound to John Mayer's \\"Waiting on the World To Change\\". While it is nice to hear Bieber accompanied by electric guitar and drums, the cut has its own imperfections. Vocally, Bieber's is inconsistent; his falsetto is thin, sometimes he changes his tone, and occasionally his diction lacks clarity (mush mouthed).  By the time closer \\"Nothing Like Us\\" arrives, the listener is happy. Unfortunately, the closer opts for slower, more hushed fare as opposed to given the listener some `bounce' and much needed tempo.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B00AU2B0DE Believe Acoustic]] falls short of Bieber's studio work.  Even after listening, one wonders why a second acoustic affair was needed.  Perhaps if Bieber wanted to tide over fans, a remix album or even an EP would have been a better choice.  This is a mediocre, unnecessary release ultimately.s nice to hear Bieber accompanied by electric guitar and drums, the cut has its own imperfections.

B004Y042N8|4.0|This is a great thinking game.  Some of the puzzles are a challenge, however it gives you the option of showing you how to solve it.  I've played this for hours and haven't realized how much time has gone by.  I'm still working on the classic puzzles but you have other choices that are more challenging if you're brave enough.  I would recommend this game to anyone who likes to challenge themselves.

B008Y5OW20|4.0|This CD might not be for younger people, those who don't know the songs &#34;Smile,&#34; &#34;If I Loved You,&#34; &#34;So Sad (To Watch Good Love Go Bad),&#34; &#34;Beyond the Sea&#34; and &#34;Running Scared.&#34; But Lynne adds a little ELo to most of the songs, making this a bridge album between that band and his solo works. The highlights are &#34;She,&#34; &#34;Mercy, Mercy&#34; and &#34;Let it Rock,&#34; but some smaller pleasures exist in &#34;So Sad&#34; and &#34;At Last.&#34; If you liked his &#34;Armchair Theater&#34; album from 1990, you'll love this one.

0525953728|5.0|This books was great and I would recommend it to anyone of any age. I guess the only reason why the pentagon was trying to stop it from coming out was bc it was election year and the guys in the book clearly do not like loser Obama and felt it would probably not help Obamas re-election. Other than that, theres nothing that is &#34;top secret&#34;. Buy this book, its great!

B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Highly addictive and fun for all ages.  Keep in mind that about the time you are getting the hang of things and just can't put it down, your TRY FOR FREE time is expired.  That is definitly a great marketing strategy!!!

B005HJWWW8|5.0|I use this with a Sansa Clip when I work out in the morning. One of my complaints about the Sansa Clip was that it was not as loud as I needed. I had to turn the volume up almost all the way to hear it. This amplifier has made it so I don't have to turn the volume up as loud on the Clip and the sound quality is much improved. Glad I bought it.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The Martian was one of the most enjoyable books that I have read and I read quite a bit! I am an avid science fiction buff and have been for many years. The story line, plot, character development and hard science were great. The build up to the climax is excellent. If you enjoyed the movie Apollo 13 you will absolutely love this book. Being neither a writer nor a critic I can not do justice to this work of fiction. I eagerly await any future novels by this author.
0316286850|2.0|This book is definitely from the 90's lots of older looks but some are definitely simple and timeless and can be worn now.  Def worth a look at.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|This game is extremely addicting l. Originally downloaded for my daughter and now I cant stop playing it. Anyone who like farmville or the many look a likes will like this game. The major issue I have with this game is if you have your card hooked to the account it's way to easy for purchases to happen on accident and unless you don't have acorns which is used as currency in the game all it takes is one misclick to spend them. I imagine this is on purpose so your more likely to spend. A fun game though
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved everything! This was the 2nd time through, and I still enjoyed every bit. Now onto the others for a second time!
B007FDE4Y8|2.0|It is so hard to balance this thing. I thought I was getting a great deal when it said I was saving $400 so that I would only have to pay $200, instead it appears that everyone pays about 200 for it when I saw reviews on Youtube. Everyone seems to have a hard time balancing it, but I am having the hardest time of my life. I have Canon T3i with a 50mm lens. If anyone knows how to place the camera on this thing and balance it send me some sort of response.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Most sequels, rather it's a movie, game or book never pan out to be better than the original but this bad boy did just that...grat game, great graphics and great fun!
B004XZR63M|5.0|Excellent book! Easy to understand and taught me information I never knew. Didn't learn any of this stuff in school!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game may seem really hard, but once you get the hang or all the controls,then it's very fun and addicting. I recommend this game to people who played temple run 1, and liked it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Magnificent.  All the women I know would never admit to having read this tantilizing book.  I love all three books. Lets have more!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is so fun and its awsome how uounprople have the little Cary riding after so long of playoling this game its such a step up from temple run 1 this is like a temple run 3000

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Read it in one sitting very intense story, I myself was in a very similar situation as holder so I like how she show the effects on everyone and not just the main character. Regrets aren't a way to live life and the only reason five stars is cause I hate to cry during a romance novel, it's supposed to make me happier. But it was still a very good romance,and read. Felt very realistic and drew me in.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Bought it to see what the hype was about. Stopped reading it because I was so bored. The sex scenes were not that great, and the story line was a yawn.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This movie may not be for everyone, but if you have any childhood memories of young love, camping and just plain fun, this is your movie.
B005ZMTAXQ|5.0|Of course, this is an amazing follow-up film.  We love it.  The Toy Story Series is the epitome of excellent childhood entertainment.  There are plenty of life lessons included in the fun.  My one concern, with this series and so many wonderful films for children, is that there are cheap bathroom-type jokes included (farts and burps kind of things).  It's not the worst thing in the world but it really IS unnecessary and &#34;ever-so-slightly&#34; taints perfection.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I know you can see reruns of Big Bang but that will end and I want to be able to watch these for a long, long time. Get them before you loose out and no I don't own DVD rights to the show ( I only wish ).
B00B2V66VS|2.0|The graphics are not well done. The first one had better graphics. However the new adventures and multiple new obstacles are nice.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|This is a fun game, though it didn't take very long to get through. I played the casual level and needed to use the hints to know what to do next. Instructions for some of the puzzles are confusing.
1616550414|5.0|This book is amazing. The book heavily covers the making of Skyward Sword which gives a lot of insight into the process the Zelda team takes in making a new game. It covers the timeline, with several sidenotes along the way. One of my favorite things is all of the concept sketches inside, including characters and races that never made it into the games. This book is thorough, and beautifully laid out. Additionally the book is quite solid and well bound including gold printing on the cover. As if this wasn't all good enough, it's going for half off the suggested retail price as of writing this review... I'm VERY pleased with this book as no doubt any serious Zelda fan would be!
1451683405|1.0|I found the ideas presented in a repetitive fashion, and the arguments circular and lacking clarity. Contradicts himself when speaking of choice and tries to avoid being deterministic. Overall I did not find it worth a read.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|&#34;Sarah's Key&#34; came highly recommended and didn't disappoint. I was enthralled from Chapter 1. Looking forward to more Tatisana de Rosnay.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I admit it, I'm addicted. I can't get enough Downton Abbey. Season 3 picks right up with the intrigue, drama, romance, and intertwined lives of the Crawley family and their downstairs staff. The writing, acting, costumes, and scenery are suberb. Highly recommended.
B007WFTFG6|5.0|Bought this for our toddler to just doodle for quiet times, but I'm finding the older elementary kids like this one, too. Causes them to have creativity, yet has little items they can add to their doodle to complete their artwork.
B0051YDTKS|5.0|This is a classic! I would recommend this album to heavy metal fans and anyone who liked Black Sabbath with Ozzy.
0307950654|3.0|It's a risk for any author to adopt the characters of another, especially Eliza and Darcy.  But, I had read that P D James was a premiere mystery writer, so even if I didn't like how she handled the characters I would at least enjoy a good mystery.  To me, Jane Austen's characters were little more than background for a very trite, uninteresting and unexciting mystery.

B004Q9T4E4|5.0|Ferguson's premise, and the arguments put forward to support it, are cogent, accessible to numbskulls (like me) and intellectuals alike, and compelling.<br />Should be compulsory reading for Western High School students, because whether they like it or not, the Chinese are coming.<br />And as Ferguson says, for every one western high school graduate, there are 18 Chinese graduates, who are smarter, prepared to work harder, for less money. Because they want the western lifestyle that the western graduate thinks is his birthright.
0425263908|5.0|Although fifty shades was a great story. This was even better! I don't care much about the sex when I read books but the connections between characters.  There were some very deep parts in this book. Things I found very disturbing while reading. For example Gideon's nightmares I thought they were awful!  Specially because Eva has gone through a similar situation. I was heartbroken for them both while reading this book. I know a lot of people read it and think its too much sex, or too many arguments that are stupid. But they're too people trying to recover, trying to accept each other. They find comfort in having sex. Although it does not fix their problems, its the way they deal with things. Its a really good book, but its sad that things like these do happen in reality. There are people out there suffering what they both suffer in the story.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Wow!  what an amazing story.  The realization that the brain doesn't control our consciousness but is rather the limiting factor is incredible insight!

B00AMBLXP8|3.0|I liked the story overall, however, I did not think it was funny and I did not like the vulgar language.  This movies could have been better for not the vulgar language.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was amazing. I couldn't put it down! And that doesn't usually happen to me. The end made me think so hard that it started being hard to think. I think if you liked the hunger games, you will love this book. READ IT!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is the first book that I've read in years, and I couldn't put it down! It isn't one of those smutty romance novels full of sex. It has a story...an incredible story that will leave you laughing, crying, and sighing all in the same sentence! Stunning revelations leave you holding yourself back from speed reading, so that you can take in every amazing word that comes out of Holder's mouth. I wish this book was one of a series!!

B0055OMBIU|4.0|I bought this for my 15 year old grand daughter before we go on a trip to Paris. It is a great idea, but too complicated and too intricate for a quick put together.

B00AUJ9NZE|5.0|I have been a Holmes fan for 50 + years but hadn't even thought about these adventures for a long time.  Having read &#34;On Conan Doyle&#34; by Dirda, I wanted to go back and see if these tales held the same fascination in my &#34;twilight years.&#34;  They do and even more so as I am delighted all over again with the wonderful plot twists and turns and endless cleverness displayed by the famous detective with his own Ed McMahon in Dr Watson.
B000ERU5EK|4.0|If you like Trance, this contains wonderful tunes.  From melodic to house.  This has everything that a Tranciholic could wish for.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|Sir David plays such a wonderful role in narrating this series.  The scenery is just amazing.  If you have a big screen TV, this is a must. The earth and its inhabitants never looked to wonderful.  A must for everyone
B007X15GRQ|3.0|I wish I could have given this 2 1/2 stars, I think to go as high as three is a stretch.  But, with that said, it's not the worst marky mark movie I have seen.
B000YMM3CC|4.0|Typical boy meets girl and fall in love. Then, the drama of life enters the scene. I recommend this movie if you are a sucker for romance.
B007BVOF8E|3.0|This was not bad.  A little slow at times, but overall worth a rental.  You can definately get through a plane ride with this.
B006LSZECO|3.0|During the first half of the story, I was completely absorbed.  It pulled me right in.  But, that absorption didn't stick.  I felt it was a bit contrived and too slick.  I finished the book just on general principle but did not feel that the style endured.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|Poorly written and frankly dull for a couple who have a good sex life filled with fantasy . The best thing about this book is I hope it will cascade others into  producing erotic video and writing erotic fiction aimed at what women like to think about during sex. To date almost all erotic material has been male oriented. Women ,generally, particularly like erotic fiction over video. Males temd to the visual while women seem to enjoy the mind fantasy they can fit to themselves while reading a well written story. Bondage, toys etc. are ocassionally fun but far less important than the 95% of sex that occurs in the mind. Almost no one wants to actually carry out the fantasies and promptly forget them until the next encounter<br /><br />.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game is very fun to play.  I loved the story and different levels.  If you need a little help the hint button is very helpful. Great job G5.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I don't really have anything important to say except for I LOVE IT!!!! this app rocks!! its like being able to do math wherever you need to (ie, grocery store, friend's house, car) just by whipping out your device!

B004UID2LC|4.0|wow, all the negative reviews make me feel like I shouldn't have even purchased this app.....when I had it on my kindle fire (I removed it cuz my storage space was low) it worked GREAT and it's like having free videos on your device. plus, once they're on, you don't need wifi to watch them! then again, my kindle was a lot faster after I uninstalled the app.......
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My son and I love playing this game.  It is very entertaining and even I can keep up with my 9 yr old.

B004SJ3BCI|4.0|ok, so for the longest time, everyone was always talking about angry birds (not just people there was merchaindise everywhere! ) and I never knew what the heck they were talking about. so when I got my kindle fire, there is no surprise that one of my first purchased apps was angry birds. when I first played it I was like &quot;all you do is sling birds at green pig heads? this is stupid!&quot; but I kind of got addicted to it and over a week couldn't stop playing it! (just like Tim Hawkins's song!! lol) this app is weird when you start but addicting after a week when you cant stop! lol (in case you were wondering : I ended up picking up a piece of merchandise myself! ) :)

B00009Z576|4.0|Chances are that anyone interested enough in Yes and this album to reading this review will be at least somewhat familiar with its history, but in case not, here's a little background:  in 1979, the classic Yes lineup of Jon Anderson, Chris Squire, Steve Howe, Rick Wakeman and Alan White entered the studio for another attempt at delivering the magic they'd re-discovered on 1977's \\"Going For The One\\" (the 1978 followup, \\"Tormato\\" is generally regarded as one of their worst albums).  Instead, the sessions went nowhere and Rick Wakeman departed for the 2nd time, along with founding member, lead vocalist and the voice/face of Yes, Jon Anderson.  The band had replaced Wakeman before, but... no Jon Anderson?  This would not be easy.<br /><br />Enter:  THE BUGGLES!  Geoff Downes (keyboards) and Trevor Horn ( vocals, bass) best known for their 1979 hit \\"Video Killed The Radio Star\\" shared Yes' label and were fans, so had written a song for Yes.  They were completely unaware that Yes had lost two key members, and in what has to be one of the most bizarre instances of how bands come together, the two were actually recruited to JOIN the Yes band they thought they were simply presenting a song to.<br /><br />The new lineup recorded \\"Drama\\" and released it in August, 1980.  It was moderately well-received, though the U.S. tour that followed was more successful, selling out nearly all venues including 3 nights at Madison Square Garden.  Fans back home in the U.K. were far less interested in a Yes without Jon Anderson, and the brutal responses there helped trigger the end of the band (until Trevor Rabin helped resurrect it along with Alan White and Chris Squire, but that's another story).<br /><br />That said, the most important thing to know about \\"Drama\\" is:  is it any GOOD?  Surprisingly, YES!  As the liner notes spell out, part of the \\"classic\\" Yes vocal sound was always the backup vocals of Chris Squire and Steve Howe, and they are both here.  Add in that Trevor Horn's voice really does have a similar tonal quality to that of Jon Anderson's (though he lacked Anderson's range), and the biggest difference between \\"Drama\\" and earlier Yes classics really isn't the vocal sound, it's the musical approach.  Gone are the sprawling album-side length tracks where each instrumentalist weaves around the other (although two tracks here do exceed 8 minutes).  Instead, drummer Alan White and bassist Chris Squire really assert themselves and lay a more traditional rock-based framework for more modern sounding and straight-forward songs, an approach that would soon become even more the norm as Yes pressed on in 1983 with Jon Anderson back on vocals and Trevor Rabin stepping in for Steve Howe.<br /><br />This straightforward foundation that the \\"new\\" Yes would adopt applied to songs where Yes were still more interested in challenging themselves musically than charting a single leads to an interesting mix, a true \\"missing link\\" between the classic 70's Yes and the newer, more radio-friendly Yes of `90125'.<br /><br />The highlight of \\"Drama\\" is easily the closing track \\"Tempus Fugit\\" (a Latin expression for \\"Time Flies\\").  New Yes, old Yes, Jon Anderson or not, this is just a superb track and is sadly lost on many Yes fans who ignore \\"Drama\\", but Yes proudly featured it on their Yesyears box set and \\"The Ultimate Yes 35th Anniversary Collection\\", and rightfully so.  Simply put, it's a track no Yes fan should be without.<br /><br />\\"Machine Messiah\\" opens the album and before the keyboards of Geoff Downes make an appearance anyway, this one could almost pass for old Black Sabbath.  It really is a stomping and powerful riff, but 10:28 is enough time for Yes to take the song through several sections and remind us that this really is Yes.  All in all this one is a microcosm of the album as a whole:  different, but still sounding like classic Yes in some spots, firmly looking to the future in others.  Worth exploring, but not their best.<br /><br />\\"Does It Really Happen\\" is probably the 2nd strongest track after \\"Tempus Fugit\\" and could almost be considered the precursor to \\"It Can Happen\\" on `90125' three years later.  It's mostly straightforward, but still some excellent playing by all.  With a little re-working, this one could have appeared on `90125'.<br /><br />\\"Into The Lens\\" is a little bizarre and jarring to these ears, but not a bad track.  For better or worse, the intro evokes older Kansas, which is the first time I thought Yes ever sounded like another band.  Probably not a good thing, but overall the track works (although I prefer the much shorter single-edit included here as a bonus track).<br /><br />\\"Run Through The Light\\" is mostly non-descript but also not a track that screams out to be skipped, as is \\"White Car\\", which must be the shortest vocal track in the entire Yes catalog (running time: 1:21).<br /><br />That's the 6 tracks as the album was released in 1980, but the bonus track edition features plenty of worthwhile material as well:  as previously mentioned, the single edit of \\"Into The Lens\\" (3:48) goes down a little easier than the 8-minute plus full-length version, though the single edit of \\"Run Through The Light\\" seems pointless (it's all of 12 seconds shorter than the full version).<br /><br />Also included are early studio run-throughs of \\"White Car\\" and \\"Tempus Fugit\\", the latter giving a nice glimpse into an early draft of the song where vocalist Trevor Horn was still scatting vocal melodies in some places since the lyrics had not yet been written.  You won't prefer it to the finished version, but it's an interesting listen to Yes creating in the studio.<br /><br />Also included are 2 song ideas not used on the album, presented here as instrumentals (\\"Have We Really Got To Go Through This\\" and \\"Song No. 4\\").  Neither are anything to spin the head or compete with earlier Yes classics, but they are interesting.<br /><br />The last 4 tracks are from the 1979 sessions of the classic Yes lineup before Rick Wakeman and Jon Anderson gave way to the Buggles, and as another reviewer noted, the only reason for their inclusion here seems to be to emphasize to those fans that don't care so much for Drama that... \\"Hey, it could have been worse\\".  These sessions were produced by Roy Thomas Baker, and while he may have delivered magic with early Queen and a few other acts, he only serves to neuter what Yes were trying to do here:  \\"Dancing Through The Light\\", an instrumental, is out and out pop with Alan White's talents on drums all but lost in a soft and fuzzy drum sound that recalls a drum machine more than the fantastic player that he is.  The \\"Friend of A Friend\\" intro makes the band sound more like The Cars (also produced by Baker) until Anderson comes in, but it doesn't get a lot better after that either.  While Yes fans may have been saddened by the departure of Wakeman and Anderson and not accepting of their replacements, these tracks show that something had to give, and imo the finished product of \\"Drama\\" is infinitely better than what they were originally working on in 1979.<br /><br />All in all, this is 3.5 star album but I'm rounding up to 4 because it is so under-appreciated and hey, it's YES!  Not their best, but far, FAR from their worst.  If you like Yes -- particularly if you like BOTH the earlier classic and the 80's Trevor Rabin eras -- this is a solid addition to the collection.ally Happen\\" is probably the 2nd strongest track after \\"Tempus Fugit\\" and could almost be considered the precursor to \\"It Can Happen\\" on `90125' three years later.

B008OOYALE|2.0|I love this game. It is so much fun. I wish it didn't take so long to evolve,grow Apple's,eggs to hatch and trees to be removed.  Also everything is so expensive, I am a very impatient person.  I have bought gold one time but it went quickly because I sped everything up.  I find myself checking on my dragons every hour or so just to get the money at least. So overall I love it.<br /><br />BUT...... amazon has not updated to the new version this makes me mad.  I also have this on my ipod and never have to wait for Apple to do updates, what takes amazon so long I don't know.<br /><br />So to sum it up I love the game but not on my kindle because of Amazon being so slow at updates. I won my kindle I wish I would have won a ipad instead, because amazon sucks!!!!
0765325950|5.0|I enjoyed this read.  About a third of the way in I got nervous that the pacing was too quick and that it would slow, given how much of the book remained.  I shouldn't have been; great book, gratifying ending to the series.
B008AUGEFC|5.0|I finished \\"Cloud Atlas\\" several minutes ago and run to my computer to write this review. More than a review I hope is an invitation for reading it. In this, I add my enthusiasm to the other readers that enjoyed the novel.<br /><br />I bought it after several months of impatient waiting. The first time I listen about \\"Cloud Atlas\\" was because of the movie starred by Tom Hanks and at that time was being filmed somewhere. I haven't seen it yet but for all purposes was the movie that brought the book to the mean and petty bookstores of my country --Chile-- not the other way round.<br /><br />Either way I knew that it was about several stories intertwined over a long span of time, from XIX century to a deep and fathomless future. That was the hook to me: a single story preserved and resolved in some way through a thin narrative thread. That was I expected. But what I got was still better.<br /><br />I usually miss the writer dexterity in some novels, especially in those whose covers promise you a 'tour de force' or let you breathless. Most of the time that means nothing. A good plot without the craft of a good writer is like a football game heard in the radio. Or something even worse: a tennis game. And this is because the plot is not enough.<br /><br />Thus, David Mitchell give us a plot plus a narrative plus a character that (to me at least) is unforgettable: Timothy Cavendish. During his own feat he gives us the best part of the novel. The rest of the characters doesn't have the strength of this one. He is a clever construction of the author. More than an Englishman he looks like a French one. I don't know, such an old man is so sympathetic, weak, elusive, that you'll not forget him.<br /><br />Well, the stories are all related by tiny details that are skillfully put just in front of you. It is easy to realize that they are there beating like a real heart in spite of the years (I mean, centuries between the first story and the last one). In this vain the stories go from the past into the future and so, after passing the middle of the book, from the future to the past, solving every unfinished issue and tying all the loose ends. In this structure, the best part (as usual) is the second one where the stories are solved. I believe that was Virginia Woolf who said that when you begin to read a novel what you want more is to get very soon to the end. David Mitchell seems to have listened her advice because the descending part --say-- is like the final part of a roller-coaster.<br /><br />And this is exactly why I'm here writing this. Do like me, you'll not feel disappointed.<br /><br />P.S.: I don't know what is going to happen when I see the movie, but --as Dostoyevsky said in \\"Crime and Punishment\\"-- that is another story.rom the past into the future and so, after passing the middle of the book, from the future to the past, solving every unfinished issue and tying all the loose ends.

B00004U2EZ|5.0|I got this CD because 'Belle' is one of my all time favorite songs and I never get tired of listening to it. The whole CD is full of good songs to listen.
B00001OH1S|5.0|Just watched this movie again... hadn't seen it in years!  Loved the music and bought the soundtrack. Can't go wrong when Sting is on a soundtrack. Highly recommend it!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series keeps getting better and better!  I can't wait until season four!  The acting is phenomenal and so well written.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|Tegan and Sara have been progressing into different sounds for quite a while now, though it has normally been a slower development. This album made a pretty huge leap into the electronic sound, but I think they pull it off perfectly though. It may not satisfy all their older fans, but I've been a fan since a little bit before So Jealous and I'm still loving this album. If you keep an open mind, I think any previous Tegan and Sara fan will enjoy it.
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|This living legend lives up to his status yet again. His music is a breath of fresh air among a pool of talentless noise we hear today. Highly recommend!
B0090P98Z4|2.0|Pretty darn good game except that the controls for the freeze up sometimes. The movements of the warrior are pretty jerky and sticky. You go through same corridors the whole spire with just more demons or tougher to kill demons and bosses thrown in. The constant request for updates sucks, you have to put WAY TOO MUCH MONEY in this game to progress, or to upate your weapons and skills.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|This app is really fun, but as few times I have tried to get on it and the sound doesn't work. Yes, my volume is up because the sound on other apps works fine, it's just the sound on this one, If that happens I just remove from device, download it again, and it's as good as new.

B00A3SGWYC|3.0|I have enjoyed this CD, but he is using many of the same phrases and sounds from his last album.  &#34;Mr. Worldwide&#34; is said over and over and his classic &#34;woo-hoo&#34;.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Completely different than what I expected...in a good way! Rowling departs from her well known and loved Potter series and delves into the dark underbelly of society. She takes a no holds barred approach in regards to her topics and characters. She introduces a lot of different characters in the beginning, but stick with it! She makes you feel anger when you should probably feel pity and sympathy when you should feel disgust. A very powerful and realistic book. One of the best I've read in a long time. I have, and will continue to, recommend this book.
0783231032|3.0|Complete with lots of stars, zanyness, and mayhem. Reaches slapstick comedy levels at times and is confusing. Three cheers for a bungling military saving our coast.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Fast paced, disturbing case and Bosch just being Bosch. I thought it was great! I'm enjoying watching his relationship with his daughter develop.
B009D95IJM|5.0|This is a must have for anyone who loves and appreciates cats in the home.  You will literally laugh out loud.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Fun Hidden Object Adventure Game. Good graphics and storyline! Got it on sale for $2.99 so it was worth the price. Want to try other G5 games now!
B003ZUTS5A|4.0|I really liked this movie. It was really good but even though it was in HD it didn't look HD. From now on I will probably get normal for a dollar less!
B007NZDES0|5.0|Sade and her band seem to know how to set a line up for their music very well. They seem to know what we really love from them and bring it honestly each time with a touch more. I was expecting this concert to be a lackluster compared to the previously, spectacular \\"Lover rock\\" concert but I was pleasantly surprised. Even though Sade doesn't have the biggest vocals, I think she knows how to really work with what she has to benefit the outcome tremendously, giving us something we can't explain except the words exceptional performance. The band is crazy tight as usual. You will rarely see a band as tight as this one. You can see them playfully glancing at each other while grooving on many songs; And with minimal illusions and staging the visual is still dynamite. They go through many of their latest songs from the \\"Bring me home\\" cd. I knew I liked many of the songs on the new cd and play them often but seeing them perform the songs live made me like them more. Many of the usual hits are here with some done with a little change in craftsmanship but not to destroy the reason why we fell in love with the songs in the first place. They add their own little dance moves ever so often but it's tongue in cheek performances just to let us know they're having fun with us having fun with them. I loved this concert and recommend it to anyone who likes to let the music transport them or to hear real instruments being played and being played well with a touch of the visual awe to bowl you over. Bring me home proves Sade and crew aren't just \\"Soldier's of love\\", they're also true funk soldiers!

B006LSZECO|4.0|I was drawn in right from the start  Interesting characters with just enough left unsaid. Ending was a little disappointing.
0812992784|4.0|I am rather disappointed by this book. It is an important testimony on extreme terrorism that condemns someone to death for what that someone thinks or writes, or whatever they may express as for ideas or ideologies that contradict those of the terrorists. The book targets Iran and its criminal fundamentalism that called on every single Muslim in the world to kill, for hefty sums of money, a writer who was declared by some religious higher up clerics to be a blasphemous unbeliever. To have the testimony of the victim of this long unbearable and unacceptable situation is absolutely outstanding.<br /><br />And yet I am disappointed by the book. It is the testimony of a man who had to be protected by the English government against this menace, who was protected by the English police, and yet became a victim of strict limitations of his freedom of movement and freedom of expression under the authority and by decision of one or two police officers. That protection resembled a loss of freedom not to say secret-underground-home-imprisonment too much. To have that testimony is essential to understand and eventually sympathize or support the author who was the victim of such an unbearable situation.<br /><br />And yet I am disappointed by the book. There are two essential reasons why I am disappointed.<br /><br />The first one is that it is by far too long, with by far too many details that are piling up and not building, constructing an argumentation, or simply a structured testimony, in a way it seems to be a pile of sand more than a protective, defensive or vindicating wall. Most of the facts are isolated, without any perspective, mixing personal elements about the author's wives and his son along with political or police elements without showing any real architecture. At this level the book does not read easily because we get lost from one dozen of pages to the next dozen of pages, at times even from one page to the next, among details that add nothing to the sad tale.<br /><br />The second reason is that he explains rather well how he got trapped in getting into defensive religious declarations that were going against his main argument about the necessary freedom of artistic expression for an author. It was a mistake since an author is not his characters and he does not have to mix his own religious or non-religious beliefs and those of his characters. That kind of mistake is too often done by many critics, and even many authors, going as far as the caricatural sarcasm from Gustave Flaubert who once declared \\"Madame Bovary c'est moi.\\" (\\"Mrs. Bovary, that's me,\\" or \\"I obviously am Mrs. Bovary\\") It was all the more sarcastic since it was plagiarizing Louis XIV's famous declaration \\"L'&eacute;tat c'est moi\\" (\\"I obviously am the state,\\" \\"The state that's me,\\" with a strong provincial accent and emphasis on the French \\"moi\\" that could mean \\"me myself and I\\"). It is understandable that under stress and duress someone, an author or anyone else can make such a mistake. Unluckily there are too many details that lead to the impression that the author was not only under duress but was actually not clear in his mind about his being his character or not, and when we know his character is the Prophet of the Quran, there is a real problem that has nothing to do with religion but has to do with a loss of touch.<br /><br />Then the mistake has to be repaired and once again too many details lose the reader into a loose sandy labyrinth of non-obvious procedures that once again pile up more than follow a logical line or plan. Maybe the author did not have a logical line, though it is not what he says then, but it definitely is what we feel and we get lost again. That's a shame because there are quite a lot of moments when there is a real epiphany and revelation, like the accidental meeting with Margaret Thatcher, when she no longer was Prime Minister. This event is made trivial by the remark about her being a touchy-feely person, meaning that she established a physical contact with him, her hand on his fore-arm and then on his shoulder, which surprises him as a matter of fact, though it could be seen as rather banal in Great Britain.<br /><br />If the book had been cut by half it would have been a lot more effective and a lot more dynamic. The flow of this river lacks momentum and power on a subject that should inspire the greatest number of people into defending man's free soul, not only the free expression of writers. Here too I feel slightly betrayed. I do not want to provide the freedom of expression only to writers recognized (by whom?) as such. The freedom of expression is for everyone and no one can or should be freer than anyone else. At the same time, and the book completely neglects this side of things, everyone has the absolute right to be respected in their faith, beliefs, ideas, thinking whether other people identify or agree with these faith, beliefs, ideas, thinking or not. Salman Rushdie never set a line between his writing that does not menace anyone and for example the anti-Semite writing of let's say C&eacute;line that has to be clearly wrapped up in some precautionary introduction to establish a distance between the work of fiction and C&eacute;line's ideas that were unluckily going that way and have to be rejected. Even worse: the free expression of some openly racist person or group like the KKK in the US has to be rejected because of their ideology. Anyone who is insulted in his race or beliefs must have the right to say so, to sue if they want to and to be heard as victims by the courts that would deal with the complaint. Some publications publish such anti-Muslim ideas under the cover of freedom of expression of artists with the only aim of making money by selling great numbers of copies that are not clean enough to be respected. There used to be a time when public toilets were built against churches in France. I know one in Bordeaux, except if it was pulled down, and another in Saint Anth&egrave;me and that one was still standing when I last visited the village.<br /><br />The book then has a rather dull taste because it does not fulfill its promises, and I thought it was the freedom of expression for everyone.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUed a physical contact with him, her hand on his fore-arm and then on his shoulder, which surprises him as a matter of fact, though it could be seen as rather banal in Great Britain.<br /><br />If the book had been cut by half it would have been a lot more effective and a lot more dynamic.

B00B59H6EI|5.0|Have been a huge fan of Supernatural since Season One aired in 2005.  The series has NEVER disappointed me!  In terms of cast, production, writing, VFX, and overall superior quality in all things, it is not to be missed.  Guaranteed to pull you into the world of the Winchester Brothers, who have been saving us all for years, without our even knowing it!  Ackles and Padalecki are open-ended awesome talents. Indulge yourself in one of the top shows ever screened on television.

1451613512|5.0|I purchased this book with some trepidation as Stone is pretty well known as having a certain \\"bias\\" about US foreign policy and I feared the book might be a rant. Instead the book turned out to be a well-ordered and very-well footnoted history of roughly the last century of mainly, but not exclusively, American foreign policy, one that all too often has been shortsighted, foolish, and with the advent of the atomic bomb, terrifying. I'm a faily old dude going on 71 and the more history books I read the more apparent it is that there is no such thing as \\"the truth\\" or \\"reality.\\" Stone looks at the past using a different set of facts that the American Exceptionalist crowd would omit from their histories. From these two different viewpoints two different conclusions could be drawn; however, as long as the facts presented are correct, so is each different view. It's up to the reader to decide where the weight of the evidence falls.<br /><br />There were a number of times when I felt certain issues were dealt with too briefly - the Balfour Declaration being one - but given the scope of the book this brevity is understandable, and for those who might want a more thorough exegesis than a few sentences on something like Balfour whole books have been written. Guess my point is history, even very recent history, is comprised of many elements lurking in the shadows and a fuller understanding of events can only be achieved by looking at those the political class would rather have swept under the rug - permanently.<br /><br />This book is probably a must-read for those of us concerned with the fact this country spends nearly half the planet's military budget and has less-than-nothing to show for it, a stupendous misallocaton of resources (at least in my book) that's gone on for now over half a century. Defenders of this policy would site \\"national security.\\" Stone pretty well destroys this argument; Pogo was right. How we got stuck in this Tar Baby is a fascinating, if depressing, story that begins with the Truman administration, and continued to march on down the decades through various presidencies until here we are. If you have read David McCullough's \\"Truman\\" a rather positive image was revealed; not in this book. Many sides to any story and this one is definitely worth reading to better understand how we got from there to here.

B006LSZECO|5.0|It is rare to read a mystery novel with such depth of character. I was never sure I should love, hate, fear, or pity the characters, and the tortured arguments Ms. Flynn makes for each one of those emotions is so artfully done.  It was a book that I could not put down even as I alternated between exhilarating hope and shocking terror. I will definitely be reading Ms. Flynn's other works.

B0057VDGNK|4.0|Absolutely love Cliff Martinez!  His score for Soderbergh's Solaris quietly killed me with its perfection.  The man has a deft touch and a keen ear; I'll tell you that.  He knocked it out of the park with Winding Refn's Drive soundtrack/score.  Elegant, sad, just plain ol' cool.  And the beat!  The beat!  The man's a human metronome!  You can set a watch to him!  The movie just oozes with its many charms and the music puts it over the top.  His picks to kick it off are diverse and at the same time harmonious with the overall vibe of the movie and somehow with each other.  And his score would elevate any movie to greatness.  Moody and sexy.  Great listenin'.

0525478817|5.0|Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters:  fated to meet, match wits, navigate love and literary odyssey, avenge injustice and generally \\"suck the marrow out of life\\" while they can, just as they are fated not to linger overlong on this earth.<br />They meet at painfully earnest teen cancer survivors' Support Group (where fellow teenaged cancer survivors, morose or maniacally upbeat or something in-between, gather in a tiresome mantra-and-proverb-laced circle to listen to their leader's weekly iteration of his own survival and \\"ball-lessness\\" and share with one another their triumphs and struggles). Both have lost parts of themselves to the disease. Each uses a keen and pliant intellect and an old soul to full advantage, even as their bodies continue to betray them.<br />  As they battle internal and external malignancies, hijacking each other's lives and dreams while their roller coaster car speeds inexorably to its apex (read the book), Augustus and Hazel try to answer the unanswerable, hold onto slim hope while seeking graceful--or at least acceptable--exit for the sake of those they love, and find truth and meaning in whatever time they have, leaving a positive force in a scarred universe, even if they can't, as Augustus writes, \\"pull their stars into constellations.\\"<br />  This is a story concerning two young adults with cancer, but, miraculously, it is NOT a \\"book about people with cancer.\\"  Sarcastic, romantic, wildly clever, shining, even funny, it's a starry night above a wounded landscape. Someday, it--we--will all be \\"once was,\\" void, forgotten.  But for now, we are.

0440237688|5.0|This is my absolute favorite book of all time. Jonas lives in a \\"Perfect\\" Society where the government controls every minute of the people's lives. They are so removed from reality that the people do not even see in Color. Each member of Society is given a job title at the age of 12. Jonas is chosen to be the new keeper of memories. He begins studying under the current keeper of memories but soon reality becomes too much for him and he has to decide if he is going to stay and receive his training, enduring the true pains of the world, or run a way to someplace real so that he does not have to endure societal structures. Such a great book, since i was 9 ive probably read this book over 50 times. Cannot wait to introduce this book to my children and my students

B005LAIH2C|3.0|To say that this movie was bad is an understatement. The dialogue was horrible. The story was full of more holes than Swiss cheese. What's really big? Hmm... let's say a planet. But not a small planet like Pluto that gets downgraded from being a planet; let's say something around the size of Uranus, yeah, that one works for this. The plot holes were so big, Uranus could orbit right through them. The movie was absurd. Ludicrous, even. Actually, the movie was at Ludicrous Speed.<br /><br />And I loved it for that. Okay, well, maybe I didn't love it, but I love it in concept. I enjoyed most of the heck out of it despite how bad it was.<br /><br />I can imagine how the concept for this movie came about:<br /><br />#1: Let's make a vampire movie!<br />#2: Vampires are too done, right now. People are over vampires.<br />#1: Well, let's make it vampire hunters, then!<br />#2: No, that's still vampires.<br />#3: What about witches? No one is doing witches.<br />#2: Ooh! We could do Hansel & Gretel! They fight a witch.<br />#1: Witches are lame. They're old hags that can't fight. You'd just have witch hunters walking in and killing all the witches.<br />#3: We can give them powers.<br />#1: Like vampires! They can be super strong and super fast.<br />#2: And know karate!<br /><br />And, so, we get these huge fight scenes of pasty faced witches that look like vampires and act like vampires, except for the biting, where everyone smashes through trees and boulders and flings spells and never get hurt. It was kind of awesome. I mean, it was completely unashamed of itself in how bad it was. It was like watching a four-year-old rolling around in a mud puddle being all self-satisfied. In fact, it was exactly like that.<br /><br />I mean, it was like watching kids play an imagination game where they keep making stuff up as they go.<br /><br />It starts out in a pretty normal Hansel & Gretel setting with some peasant abandoning his children in the woods. The look of the movie is as if it's set in the 1600's. All hovels and burning at the stake and all of that. But, then, as they become witch hunters, there's a scene of newspaper clippings of all the witches they kill as hunters. Newspapers which, of course, didn't exist. All of the \\"photos\\" are sketches. The movie is full of anachronistic things of that nature. The movie just doesn't care if it fits the time period or not, which is part of what made it fun. It's also part of what makes it ludicrous.<br /><br />Kid #1: We're being attacked by a witch!<br />Kid #2: I pull out my crossbow and shoot at her!<br />Kid #1: She's too fast for your lame crossbow.<br />Kid #2: It's a double-barrel machine crossbow!<br />Kid #1: Fine! I pull out my gun!<br />Kid #2: You can't have a gun! They didn't have guns!<br />Kid #1: They didn't have machine crossbows either.<br /><silence><br />Kid #2: You can have a gun.<br />Kid #1: It's big shotgun, and I shoot at the witch!<br /><br />The whole movie is like that, and, really, it does just wallow in it, and it made it a lot of fun.<br /><br />Unlike, say, Van Helsing (with Hugh Jackman) which is much  the same but took itself much too seriously to be enjoyable. In fact, Van Helsing is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, which is unfortunate, because I thought Jackman did a more then fine job with what he was given. Hansel & Gretel never takes itself seriously, and, so, I never had a problem with it. Despite all of the horrible inconsistencies. Even as I sit here writing this, I'm thinking about some of the stupid things in the movie, like the witches being, basically, a separate race and the fact that they don't actually look human at all, so why is there ever a witch problem to begin with? But I kind of also don't care even though my brain is yelling at me that I should care.<br /><br />Seriously, it's up there yelling, \\"That's so stupid!\\" And I'm shrugging and responding, \\"But it was fun.\\"<br /><br />Which is not to say that I'd actually recommend the movie to anyone, because I wouldn't. Unless you like mindless action, because that's what this is. Mindless action with a vague setting. Total cotton candy. If you like that kind of thing, this movie is just for you.<br /><br />As for the rating, it gets 3 stars because it would get a 2 on \\"goodness\\" but a 4 on \\"enjoyableness.\\"

B009IEXKXI|4.0|I enjoyed this book, although the suspense grew a wee thin after umpteen cliff-hangers. There was first an initial period of sustained reading and fascination, but I wearied, and sipped at it until the finish.

B0084B5TK8|5.0|Beautifully written in 19th century prose--atmospheric, gothic and creepy.  This is the original--All the lore of the vampires is in this book:  the effect of sacred relics and symbols, garlic flowers, the ability to change shape to wolf or bat (but only at certain times of the day or night), how to kill a vampire, mirrors, flowing water, mist....  The book is written in the form of diary entries and letters from the viewpoints of all the main characters.  There is a wonderful suspense as the character of Dracula is revealed;  first as an old man, then becoming younger as he feeds on his victims.  He is Nosferatu:  Undead.  I loved it!

I loved all three books!!! I got so involved with Katniss, and her life, and everyone in her life..Gale, and Peeta, I fell head over heels for these books. I was slightly disappointed with how quickly the end came..I guess I was expecting more drama in the boyfriend area. However I think it ended the way which was best for Peeta, Gale, and Katniss.

I don't get jolted awake and I do feel that this feature helps me to feel more rested when I wake up.  I would give it 5 stars but several of the sounds have a noticeable loop that can be distracting when trying to sleep.  Overall good purchase.
0525952926|5.0|In this historical fiction Follett wrote about 1933-1949 (World War II era) on a personal level for families in the US, Berlin, Moscow, London.  He made the politics, the horrors, depravations, the leaders in power, the spies very real.  He made it easier for me to understand how Hilter was able to take over the leadership in Germany, how Japan came to lash out, how Roosevelt was in such an awkward situation, how the revolt in Spain got under way .
B005DD7H50|5.0|I know it is wish fulfilment as a short cut to success; but I loved the movie! I highly recommend it!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This is a love story on the verge of a contemporary fairy tale.  Book 2 furthers development of the male and female protaganists as well as their relationship.  Since I read all 3 books as though they were a single book and re-read them immediately, I cannot really differentiate Book 1 from 2 from 3.  Obviously, you know that I enjoyed them since I just told you that I re-read them almost immediately.<br />The author's writing style is fluid, descriptive of setting, and fun.  Her use of Anastasia's stern conscience and her inner goddess as a way to express Ana's interior feelings/thoughts/conflicts was charming and endearing.  The author's describing the sensual looks between Christian (gray eyes) and Anastasia (blue eyes) throughout the books always got my blood warming.<br />The books did have lots of scenes involving sex which could be skimmed or skipped if reading caused discomfort.  The books do contain a wonderful story.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this series! I wish there were more books in it. It kept my attention the whole time. Would highly recommend it.
B001DHXT20|5.0|The movie doesn't spend alot of time building a back story,  jumps right into the story.  I liked that. It is a good movie
B000031EGV|5.0|I have this in VHS, and I am slowly replacing my VHS collection with DVD editions. This is such a fun movie.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I love this game! It is very easy to play and challenging enough to keep my attention. Even my son loves to play it! You can play each level quickly so it is great when you have to wait, but arent sure how much time you will have. That way you dont lose any game progress.
B007EGCD1C|5.0|I love this DVD. I have it in VHS, and I needed to replace it. It's one of my favorites
B0034G4P26|4.0|I saw this movie on my birthday and I loved it. The option for both DVD and Blu-ray is perfect for me.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Crap series. The first book was shocking for it's portrayal of sex. Once past that, there is no valid story. Poorly written.
B006JPS1OM|3.0|Works fine during the first chapter before being asked to rate the game. Fun to play but on my kindle fire HD, IF I SHUT down and try to start again later, it crashes trying to reload the second chapter. Kinda ticked I payed for full version and it seems I might not get to enjoy it. :( Update: It appears if I don't save and quit that I can get back into the game. Sort of odd to have that option if you don't need it and it actually keeps you from going back into the game. So, I have been just shutting the thing off without saving it and it seems to continue playing.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This was a really good book. Interesting from the dog's perspective. I would definitely recommend this book. I enjoyed it.
B002JWD6AS|4.0|I thought this book was good. I wasn't expecting it to be like it was, but I liked it and it interested me
B007IXWL2C|1.0|This series of books is crap. Once you get through all the sex &#34;shock&#34;, there is no story to it. Poorly written.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Hours of fun . eally enjoy this game it keep you looking for mstchs for hours. would recommend this game
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I would highly recommend this series. It was definitely a page turner. I wish there were more books to the series.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|very good turn my kindle fire hd into more then i could ever hope for need a good shot I now got the camera.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|I chose this book for Book Club. I didn't know what to choose, and kept reading rave reviews about this book. I would recommend this book.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Have always love this game & still do could play for hours.Hours of enjoyment & would recommend this to everyone
B007IXWKUK|1.0|As I said with the other reviews....this series is poorly written. There is no worthwhile story to it once you get past the sex.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good game to pass the time away. but would like to see different layout to play this solitaire. Would recommend it.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|I enjoyed this book. Can't remember if it was a book club book or one that I read on my own. I would recommend it.
B008K6HN8I|1.0|do not remeber getting this have never used so I can not review or ever try to recommend it to anyone
B000SEGUDE|5.0|My husband read the book to me, accents and all - was loads of fun.  The book really fleshes out the characters, and has a lot of interesting material that differs from the movie.  We loved both stories (the movie and the book).
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Of course Apollo 13 was a true story. This is taking that same idea and pushing it out to surviving on Mars when no one possibly should be able to. Mark is left for dead on the Martian surface when he's thought to be killed as his crew aborts their mission and makes and emergency departure. Through his resourcefulness, that of the scientists on earth and of the crew trying to return from the aborted mission, he looks for a way to somehow survive. Good psuedoscience, great storytelling and a book that you won't be able to put down. SciFi that reads like a true story! Read it!
B00AP9RQE4|3.0|Lacks the under-lying growth and evolution of the characters we have come to expect from Ms Bujold.  Yes, it's Ivan finding love at last...but it lacks...depth, which is what we have come to count on this fabulous writer for.  If you are new to Ms Bujold, co back, and read ANY of her other works from her Vorkosigan Universe, and be prepared to be blown away.  I have read ALL the other books in this series more times than I can count, and will continue to do so.  Also, if you are into fantasy, read her books Curse of Chalion and Paladin of Souls...OUTSTANDING.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Good book, could have been better.<br /><br />(Diary of a wimpy kid, Book 7)<br /><br />T H A T S  A L L
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very suspense building.  A real page turner.  The mystery and the funny retorts made it very entertaining reading.<br />No wonder Gone Girl has been on the Best Seller list for so many weeks.
B008KOTNVA|1.0|I've already written this review once and Amazon apparently removed it. This is a nice bit set but the only reason I needed it was to get the 2 Tri-wing (Y shaped) bits to work on a Macbook Pro. In the holder that is labeled as having these bits, 2 phillips bits have been substituted. I returned it and re-ordered, hoping the second kit would be as advertised but I received the same deceptively flawed kit. I guess the Asian factory workers figured no one would notice but this was the ONLY reason I ordered this kit. Very poor quality control.
B00770KR7W|5.0|Just opened this a short while ago, and within the first few minutes the peg that holds the rifle broke off. It's supposed to be fitted onto Master Chief's back with a small protrusion for his rifle to be attached. That small protrusion is what actually broke. There was no pressure applied as to warrant it breaking so easily. I'm really disappointed. The detail is really incredible. I got this as well as the [[ASIN:B005WMQDYI McFarlane Toys Halo Anniversary Series 2 - Sentinel and Guilty Spark Figure]] for my son. The toys would probably provide a lot of enjoyment if they would just last. Update 17 013: I've updated the overall rating of this toy because it just looks so dang cool!
B001MIV0J4|5.0|Great movie. Gerard Butler is phenomenal. He seems more natural in this than in any of his other films. Tom Hardy's role is not huge, but he's incredible. This is the type of movie you'll watch over and over again.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Best. Book. Ever.It is so flipping good! I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Simple very casual game. Grandkids love it. When I saw them playing I had to have it. Hope you will also.
B000HAB4KS|5.0|movie had great symbolic comparisons to plato's cave. i enjoyed it. i had to watch it for my philosophy class and it was probably the best homework ever.
6305428352|5.0|After many years of hoping to become the next great American composer, Richard Dreyfuss's character realizes he has a great passion and talent for teaching. You follow him through his career and internal struggle of doing something fulfilling that you are good at, but not following your dream as life has gotten in the way. Great cast, great plot, great music... an all and all classic.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|There are several josh fans in my family. WE all loved this cd and played it for weeks after christmas. Can't wait for his next one.
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|The movie I enjoyed. The download I didn't. The movie paused many times to the point of timeout. I ordered HD but the picture quality and sound didn't represent such. It was not  broadcast in Dolby digital surround sound.  I will not be using amazon service for watching movies any longer. I NEVER had this problem with VUDU or even Netflix.
B003Z6WFWC|5.0|This movie was Oscar worthy. Denzel didn't disappoint as an actor nor the Director of this great film. Every actor was a strong contender holding their own weight. I rented the movie but will be adding it to my video library permanently.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|No glitches or bugs as far as I've seen. Simple &amp; quick to list, make changes to listings, and to communicate with my buyers &amp; sellers.
B00AUA67GQ|4.0|This app works very well for simple note-taking. The only reason that I have it 4 stars instead of 5 is that there is a bit of a time lapse between when you write a word and when it appears on your notepad. It really is only about 1 second, and the app is free! Overall I would recommend this app!
B003THHIEM|3.0|Generically speaking, as TV shows go, this one IS better then most.<br /><br />If you're specifically looking for a &#34;CSI&#34; type show though, you will be rather disappointed.<br />This shows strength isn't in it's &#34;crime drama&#34; (pretty thin on that front) or it's plots  (VERY formulaic. Every episode is exactly the same, just a different method of murder each week). There are lots of supporting characters but as of season two, they remain 2 dimensional and .<br />No, this is just a re-tooled version of &#34;Moonlighting&#34; or any other &#34;boy/girl, underlaying awkward tension, episodic TV show&#34;.<br /><br />What makes this show worth watching (and &#34;fun&#34; even) is Nathan Fillion. Not that the rest of the cast isn't good, he just has a presence that pulls the normal into the &#34;above average&#34;. Still, the show itself (while above average for network TV) is pretty thin.
B00846REIS|3.0|I haven't even finished but it makes you review before you can advance but it is good so far but a bit pricey
B005HSL626|5.0|I think that this game is so fun people should play this! I am a pro at this game try to beet my score my score is 999.999.999.999.999.990
B0061S073A|5.0|Does a great job of keeping my kid out of apps and areas on my Kindle that aren't kid frienly, but is still easy to access kid apps.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Not John Grisham's best work. Had it figured out early just needed the details. But still well written and entertaining.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is way better than temple run one this has a way prettier background also very pretty temple run maze for ground stuff. I really recommended this to everyone who likes these kind of games and temple run
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I don't stay awake long enough to watch this on PBS, but the reviews made me sure I'd like it.  So my first big download to my new Kindle was the first two seasons.  I was right, It is fun.  Full of characters you'll love or love to hate.  Lovely British scenery, though an unrealistically sunny climate.  Interesting look at the lives of the servants as opposed to the gentry. Just enjoyable.
B00AYDC3CG|5.0|A + + + +  enjoyed this movie a lot...&#60;3 Tim Burton . I will def buy this on DVD
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Reminded me a lot of the early Terminator movies with the time travel element.  Bruce Willis was good in his role.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Excellent story line...faithful in detail to the warrior's art. I've read virtually everything VF has written and will anxiously await the next book!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Seems to work pretty good.  The picture is a little misleading.  The photo shows what looks like multiple sharpening tools.  It is in reality only one serrated edge sharpener that is to visualize the opening of that tool.  (Not 7 or 8 separate tools like on a pocket multi-hex wrench tool).  Its pretty small, so pocket tool is what it is.  It fits nicely in a Ka-Bar BK7 sheath that has a small pouch on the outside.  I guess that's where I'll leave this little tool so I know where it is.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Best book I have read in a long time. It got me immediately and held me to the end!<br />Loved it
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Read the book in two days. Wished it was longer. Really enjoyed it.<br />Can't wait for the movie. The end.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|Cool idea, good casting, a little rushed and confusing in the middle...got it though...It was late when I watched.  I'll have to watch it a couple more times at least to make sure what I might of missed thinking Hmmmmmmm.  It took me three time to see all what I missed with Inception.. Not of inception caliber.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game I actually have horses and am a western rider this app is realistic I love it you actually canntake care of the horse and not see it done
1616550414|5.0|This book is almost too awesome for me to put into words. I've long been a fan of the Legend of Zelda. It is not only my personal favorite video game series, but arguably the greatest series in video gaming, period. When this book released in Japan for Zelda's 25 year anniversary, many hoped it would get translated and come to the States. Thankfully, our wish has been granted. This book is about as high-quality as they come. The opening letter from Shigeru Miyamoto sets a wonderful, celebratory tone for the rest of the book. I can't think of a better opening.<br /><br />The first third of the book, entitled \\"The Legend Begins: The World of [[ASIN:B002BSC54I Skyward Sword]]\\" is devoted to said title, the most recently released Zelda game we all played and loved. It's filled to the brim with the concept and official art that inspired Skyward's Sword brilliant aesthetic style. As one who views Skyward Sword as one of the most beautiful and brilliantly inspired video games ever made in terms of its art design and visuals, this is just fine with me. There's tons here, including a lot of really interesting ideas for characters that didn't make it into the game, like a floating Fi in a massive suit of armor or Zelda designs that are decidedly more elegant and fancy. Really cool. There's also a good amount of location art that is simply gorgeous and really captures your imagination, just like the settings in the game did. Throughout this whole section are notes from the Zelda team, which gives nice insight into the design process of the game. It's a great start to the book, and roughly 60 pages long.<br /><br />The next section, \\"The History of Hyrule: A Chronology,\\" is probably what most Zelda fans are most excited for. It begins with a chart chronicling the various timelines and when each and every Zelda entry takes place in the chronology. Needless to say, it's quite interesting and some of it will probably be very unexpected to many fans out there who, up until now, had only their own musings and theories to make sense of it all. What is even better about this section is the following 70 or so pages that actually chronicles, in great detail, the events of each timeline in chronological order. These different timeline sections provide a lot of details about the events of each game in their respective timeline, and can be viewed as an encyclopedia of Hyrule. It's hard for me to describe this section without resorting to spoilers so I'll just say this: the official Zelda timeline is somewhat complex, with major splits and events that lead to multiple timelines. Despite how easy it would be for this to be confusing, it is presented in a way that is simple and intuitive to read through, and boy is it riveting! It really feels like you're reading a tome of legends. Sprinkled liberally through all of this are nice screenshots and art, as well as fascinating tidbits, like boxes that fully decipher the various Hylian/Hyrulean dialect text that appear in the games. How awesome is that?!<br /><br />After this is \\"Creative Footprints: Documenting 25 Years of Artwork,\\" which goes for about 100 pages. This essentially boils down to old concept art the went into almost every single Zelda game ever made. It's all amazing. Newer games get more page space, obviously. [[ASIN:B004WLRQMI Twilight Princess]] has about 32 pages, [[ASIN:B000084318 The Wind Waker (cannot wait for the Wii-U remake!)]] has 10, [[ASIN:B003O6E800 Ocarina of Time]] gets 6, and so on. You may think that some of the games deserve more space, such as [[ASIN:B00002STXN A Link to the Past (1 & 1/2 pages!)]], and you're right, but the pages are pretty huge, and it's understandable that the newer games have more art stored than the old ones. Personally, I love this section very much. The layouts are great, and the pages are huge, so trust me when I say a lot of art is given its spotlight. This section closes with a very nice letter from Eiji Aonuma, arguably the second most importantman behind the Legend of Zelda, after Shigeru Miyamoto of course. A great way to close the book.<br /><br />Ah, but the book isn't over quite yet. The book ends in spectacular fashion, with an all-new manga by Akira Himekawa, the genius duo that have made [[ASIN:1421542420 many fantastic Legend of Zelda manga already]]. Anyone familiar with their past work will not be disappointed here. I won't spoil anything about it for you, but I will say it's an all new legend, featuring a new, original Link, that essentially spells out what happened on the surface with Hylia during the original war with Demise, a story that would eventually lead to the events in Skyward Sword thousands of years later. I love that even farther back than Skyward Sword's seeming origin story, there are even more legends to tell in this universe.<br /><br />So that's the content of the book. It's all fantastic. The presentation and quality of the book itself is just top-notch. The lay-outs are nice, the printing quality is vibrantly beautiful and sharp as a tack, and the pages are crisp and clean. The binding is also high quality, which is important because this is a big book that would fall apart relatively quickly if it wasn't bound well. And how about that gorgeous cover? I love that they decided to make the Gate of Time from Skyward Sword the art on the cover. Its dazzling gold sparkle contrasts nicely with the forest green. It declares loudly and proudly to all who see it that this is a sacred historia of true legends, and you'll be proud to display it prominently. Great stuff!<br /><br />I know this review is a little lengthy and full of praise, but man, if ever a encyclopedia/art book/celebratory tome deserved it, it's this one. As I said earlier, I love the Legend of Zelda. It is by far my favorite series in gaming, a hobby I consider my favorite pastime. There are few games that capture the sense of beauty, imagination, and adventure like the Legend of Zelda effortlessly does with each and every release. This book really honors the series' legacy. If you're a huge Zelda fan like I am, or you have one in your life, getting this book is an absolute must-buy-immediately.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Even though this love story was a little juvenal for me I still really loved this book. I thought I had a few things figure out early on but was wrong. The twist that unfolded was like nothing I have read about before.
B000VMFDW2|4.0|Revealed inner feelings of a front line Marine who engaged in two important WWII battles, and told the horror of the many rotting bodies and the putrid smell of death on the battle field. It painted a vivid picture of the gruesome ordeal a few brave souls had to endure.  Did not glorify war!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|A great guide setting out simply all that you need to know about preparing your book for publishing via Kindle..
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun..kids will play and feel like they really have a horse! the only dont like that it takes forever to recharge energy!
B0049VZ222|4.0|Good watch, had me on the edge of my seat. The way it's filmed gives you the feeling zombies are going to attack at any moment. I was constantly telling the cast to watch out don't go there or pay attention. Was fun to watch going to watch season #2 on my next days off.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Excellent attention to development of characters.  Ms.McKenna explores the emotional and physical depth of the two main people of the story and weaves how their genetic backgrounds have shaped them.  Dialogue, social mores, and genuine desire for belonging are expertly meshed into the narrative. She brings together a young boy's longing for a family with that of a man who's never quite found where he fits.  I look forward to reading more from this author.
0446693804|5.0|i am a hug fan of nicholas sparks and was very happy to have found this book - thaks so much
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I absolutely  love temple run but this second one is amazing. I feel like I'm actually in the game. I'm addicted. I shouldn't play so much but it's so fun.
B007BFSYMS|3.0|the software is OK. some of the track loops are annoying. but others are good. Its a good free app to get.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Looks great, like the new features but my coins keep disappearing! Please fix this and it will be amazing. Thanks
0316228532|1.0|Not even worth a rating.  I have read such books as the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.  I got 46% through, before I ready felt this was a waste of time.  My wife only made it through 20%.  Don't waste your money!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Wonderful read. The protagonist' s voice is distinct and well carried out. The book feels as intimate as a letter between friends. Never have I liked a main character more. He is decent and honest, childlike yet wise, and ultimately, infinite...
B009JBZH54|5.0|A great way to watch probably the best comic book based moved series yet.  It also has some pretty neat features.
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is very fun and addictive. I hope everybody thinks so too. I give it 5 stars and I'm not changing it!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Reference to 80s music a plus, and more recent music choices along with a good story line.  Funny... Wilson is a blast
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I love this book so much if you write a 2nd book I would buy at any price thank you
B000SEGUDE|3.0|Artistic in execution, altruistic in content, unsatisfying in conclusion. Eleven more words required in my review; eleven pages in the book.
B008NMT684|3.0|We downloaded the free version of only 4 puzzles, really cute and fun but way too short.  It only took five minutes to do.  Great way to try it out.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Really enjoyable. Not as good as the BBC/cumberbatch version but more then worth watching. I like the progression of Holmes and a female Watson's journey towards mutual respect. Also of interest is the progression of Watson/Lucy Liu's increasing interest in solving crimes.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This dictionary of definitions, are great for helping children with their own homework,and for people's spelling words ,or their test!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love this kindle fire hd
B009O2XY12|3.0|This game is okay with the only exception that it needs wi-fi to play it and get the bonus points and boosts. it was enjoyable and a bit of entertaining.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This was a terrific book, as I would expect from grisham.  It reads a bit slow in the beginning but grabs a hold of the reader.  It develops into a first rate legal thriller.  It is only the slow initial read that causes me to give 4 stars instead of 5.  The ending is a bit brusque, but is well worth getting to.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple Run 2 is totally different than first version, but it still has it action in it. I like the new graphics and the way that is put together. it is entertaining like the first.
B00000G3PA|4.0|Action, saving the world from destruction, and setting off a big bomb, what else would you expect from Willis.  Okay, brain cells are not in demand here.  It is entertainment on the lighter side but the characters and special effects are enough to keep the viewer entertained when you just want to sit back and see the good guys save the world.  I can suspend realism now and again.  I enjoyed this movies, several times now.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game so saddicting based on trying to accomplish the missions and get the coins to get the boosts and other stuff. i'm always playing it trying to beat my own score, and it is fun and entertaining.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|its different but my bff said u should get it badly its just fun!!!!!!!!!<br />lolz its w/ dragons and etc.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|if you ever needed a calculator on your kindle fire for some basic math problem solving, then this is the app for you. it is like a basic calculator with large numbers and it is reliable. i love it.
1439152802|2.0|This is a tedious, plodding narrative that could have been tightened up into something much better than it was. This is especially true of the scenes from London during the Blitz, which go on far too long and have little interesting to say. Would not recommend it to anyone.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read ( and paid, smh) for this book because it seemed like everyone was talking about how great it was hell I read news stories that public libraries were banning this book from the shelves for being to erotic. So I thought I'll give it a try not so much into erotica but figured it might be a change of pace. Boy was I right the pace was a full fledged run off the side of a building. This book made me so angry it was so boring, repetitive, childish, and any scene attempting to be erotic was overshadowed by the terrible writing. This is supposed to be a 21 yr. colleges student? Who from the sounds of it spends a good amount of time drinking wine,champagne, cosmos, beer but gets $h:/? face drunk after 5 margaritas almost gets molested then ends up puking in the bushes as she saved by a billionaire? So she can be whisked away to his hotel room where she wakes up and he's undressed her and the only thing she does is blush ..... And she doesn't even have an email address?......right... now I wish I could have the 10 dollars I spent so I could get drunk and forget this pile of garbage.. all those ladies  out there who think this is literary genius and got all hot and bothered with this book.....maybe get laid that will be a better use of your time than sitting around fantasizing over a crappy book. Reading the low reviews is the only satisfaction I got from this book they are too funny I Couldn't stop laughing..
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|Like it but it could be a little harder.It's pretty easy to solve. I wouldn't recommend. buying this one. They have much better ones out.
111846446X|5.0|It is a good book when starting to work with the Raspberry Pi.  It has a lot of good information in it & is very helpful.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Im from the old school who played this game in the old video arcades. I love playing this and would recommend to 40+ and older
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I'd give this game 5 stars but I really do not like how often it shuts down.. If I try to save myself the game freezes and takes away my gem.  Other than that the game is a ton of fun.  I just hope the company fixes the bug!
B001IF277K|5.0|buen servicio y envió.<br />producto a un excelente precio.<br />no he tenido problema con el rendimiento de la articulo.<br /><br />Gracias
B003O86FMW|5.0|Yet another incredible novel from Suzanne Collins! This book is definitely my favorite of the three in the Hunger Games series, but the whole series is awesome too! This novel and series are definitely must reads!
B0049VZ222|4.0|I like this series. However, I do not like how far it strays from the original graphic novels. If you can look past that then you will love this.
0375413405|5.0|I have used Julia's &#34;The Way to Cook&#34; cookbook for years.  Just wanted to have a copy of her original, groundbreaking cookbook for my collection.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|If you've heard it, you know. One of the catchiest songs out there. I admit that I find myself singing it throughout the day.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|This is an ok game, however, the first Magic Academy was better. I suppose there is too much dialog. It is not really challenging at all.
B007FH9GT2|1.0|My wife and I rented this movie for date night, but instead, got offended by the vulgarity and rough nature of this film. Why the rape scene, seriously?
B002RSQGQK|5.0|Oh, Hitchcock, where have you been all my life?  Or, more accurately, where have your full-length films been all my life?  I've been a fan of Hitchcock since I was very young, but for some reason I had limited myself (consciously or not?) to the short films and television episodes.  Rear Window is the first of Hitchcock's full-length feature films that I've seen, and I will definitely be back for more.  Jimmy Stewart is at his best & Grace Kelly is absolutely stunning.  It's odd to see a woman in an active role, considering Hitchcock's leading ladies tend to be victims.  That's just one of the reasons Rear Window is so impressive.  It's a film about films and about film watching - the protagonist is a voyeur and we are all voyeuristically watching his experiences.  We align ourselves with him, but the disturbing feeling we get isn't so much from the antagonist (a murderer, possibly?) but from the sense of identifying with a &#34;hero&#34; who is immoble and impotent.  It's an uncomfortable place to be, particularly as Hitchcock assumed his audience to be male.  Feminists and film theorists, of course, have much to say about this film - and for good reason!  Wow.
B0073PZIYI|2.0|This is a very boring movie. That's really all I can say about this.  Timberlake should stick to singing instead of acting.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is totally amazing!!! its temple run with a crazy twist! I would go on, but I don't want to spoil the fun. but the one thing I will say is that I recomemd you get it!
B009G8GRX6|4.0|This is a different kind of Muse.  It is different than what you are probably used to. Madness is the best track.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|Finally a controller that made me wipe the dust off of my PS3, it's very important to have a controller that feels like the xbox especially in fps games, I have not experience any dead zones or disconnects, I love the light up buttons and the texture grip, rumble and six axis TOO, this changed everything about shooters for my ps3,  I'm thinking about grabbing another one just for farts and giggles
B005DD7H50|4.0|This was an alright rent. Worth the hour and half to watch it. I would never own this though. Story line is ok and makes you wonder what YOU would do.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If I would want anything it would be these.<br />- armor<br />_easier way to get to nether ( iron blocks instead of gold)<br />_ simple red stone (after all it is just a phone can't be too complicated)<br />_caves<br />_ and my #1 thing I want is buckets (yeah, if they only added buckets next update I would be okay with<br /> it
B00AMBH70S|3.0|It was a good action movie, but left a lot of questions up in the air. It is unlike the other Bourne's so don't get your hopes up.
0307592731|5.0|Great Story I loved it Inspiration and Luck moved the woman from here past to the future, a good read
B005UA0FLE|5.0|It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas! You bet it is. This album is a great Holiday treat.  It really brings in the Christmas spirit in a way only the Buble can!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I read this for a book club and it made for a good discussion. My only complaint is that this book is not eligible for lending.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|My wife and I got this movie as a rental and really enjoyed it. A Rom-Com about baseball and with Clint Eastwood?! Sure, you bet.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun game. It is easy to play yet requires thought. It tends to be addicting. Great entertainment.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|This movie was just weird. Not sure that I understood what was even going on. The graphics were almost cartoonesque.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I use this for my son who has sensory issues. I let him customize differed sounds music etc. Final he enjoys bed time and sleeps through the night. I also use it during the day for relaxation for him, when needed. This was helpful for my son, he is five, diagnosed with PDD. I don't know if, this would be useful information to many or if it would  work for you but for the price, no harm in trying.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I've watched each of the films leading up to this and enjoyed the culmination of each into this action packed movie.
B005COO1X6|5.0|My husband likes to read Stephen King books, he liked this one very much as it lived up to his expectations.  He wanted to read all books in this series.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|lt super awesome I rate it 5 star because its skillful and it has 101 games that are skillful if they had 10 star I would rate it that its awesome!!!!!!!!!!!
B002SAUCBC|5.0|My husband likes to read Stephen King books, he goes on longer trips and enjoys reading to pass the time.
B006KP3XCQ|3.0|I love this movie and I'm glad I purchased it. However, the package was heavily damaged and not in the condition as advertised. I was surprised that is actually played after seeing the packaging.
