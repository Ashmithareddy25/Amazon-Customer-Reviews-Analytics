B003YL4LYI|4.0|I have enjoyed all the previous volumes, but the author has set himself a tough task and in volume five you can see what he's up against: he has to pull so many threads together--and he can't help adding still more stories and characters--that just writing a book is too much. So what we have in volume five is a set of structural necessities, leavened with some of Martin's irrepressible creativity, which may be ill-advised here.<br /><br />In sum, if you are following the series, you need to read this book. It is clearly the site of his gathering himself for the final push. It is interesting but not fascinating and compelling in the way that the first three and part of the fourth books were. But ok. It's a heroic task he's set himself and I'm willing to recognize that sometimes you have to be workmanlike rather than brilliant. Volume 6 of the series will tell whether he's just hitting his marks, or is now on the race back to the barn.

030758836X|5.0|This is an intense and scary (in many ways) look inside a marriage. Guy named Nick Dunne is married to gal named Amy Elliott. On the day of their 5-year anniversary, Nick is at work and receives a call from one of his neighbours \\"Nicky, I just thought you should know...your door is wide open, and that cat of yours is outside. It isn't supposed to be, right?\\"<br /><br />No it's not, so Nick goes home; Amy is not there.<br /><br />From being in Nick's head, the reader already knows that this marriage wasn't doing so well, mostly because Nick doesn't sound happy --and maybe a bit weird too, especially when he says \\"There's something disturbing about recalling a warm memory and feeling utterly cold.\\" Flynn switches her storytelling between both Nick in real time, and Amy from her diary entries; these entries start at the beginning of their relationship and follow their love story.<br /><br />The contrast between Nick's present unhappy marriage and Amy's storytelling of falling in love, and of their perfect match gives a stronger sense that something is really awry. Flynn exploits this brilliantly by throwing in unexpected sentences here and there that unbalances the reader, creating strong discomfort. While Nick is questioned by two detectives, he thinks \\"It was my fifth lie to the police. I was just starting.\\" And of course, the reader immediately thinks \\"well, what were the first four?\\" Later during the questioning by the detectives, Nick says to himself \\"This was my eleventh lie.\\"<br /><br />Gillian Flynn expertly manipulates the readers by having them constantly change their opinion about Nick depending on what he says, thinks, does, or how he acts, reacts, or stays passive. I've not often read a book where I've felt so absorbed and uncomfortable at the same time. The underlying creepiness and unsettling atmosphere coming off the page are as intense and as close as possible to experiencing it in real life.<br /><br />The marriage has gone insanely wrong. The readerrealizes that Nick and Amy are either very wrong for each other, or perfectly matched; you'll have to decide. But I warn you, there are no wrong answers; I'm tempted to say no right ones either. Gillian Flynn unspools a clever and intricate plot that is both machiavellian and pure genius in its depiction of a modern-day relationship. Being careful not to spoil anything to those who haven't read the book yet, I'll say this: when you've finished reading GONE GIRL, Michael Douglas and Glenn Close's relationship in \\"Fatal Attraction\\" will seem like a great love story to you.<br /><br />While all clues point towards Nick, and as his lies become apparent to the police, he becomes the main suspect in the disappearance of his wife. His nonchalant, almost bored attitude seem very suspicious to both the media and the public opinion too, especially since \\"the husband is almost always guilty\\". To deflect some of that tension, Gillian Flynn takes us deep into the couple's married life to show Nick and Amy at their best and worst. We learn about the loss of their jobs, about Amy's unhappiness regarding their move from New York City to a rented McMansion on the Mississippi, about the money problems, the question of having kids, and of secrets from before they knew each other.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn's sense of timing is as perfect as if she is building an enormous clock --or a time-machine-- that she uncovers one or two pieces at a time, while revealing Nick and Amy's day to day story. Flynn brings new developments exactly when you don't expect them, winding the story back in the opposite direction of where you thought it was heading, while the plot still keeps going forward. Flynn does that often but you follow willingly because it is always believable --you can still hear the tick-tock of the clock in the background, and the grinding of the time-machine-- and her moves are backed-up by elements she has spread throughout the pages (almost nonchalantly, you think) and everythingclicks together until you finally see the whole work. Or maybe not.<br /><br />Another aspect that proves Flynn's total control of the story is her ambidextrous talent for both male and female points of view, especially with the characters inner-dialogues which are a major part of the novel. She is as credible inside Nick's head as she is inside Amy's; not only that, but their changing moods and their actions are rendered as convincingly as any great actors could play them. Speaking of which, these two characters are dream roles for any talented actors who play within a wide range of emotions.<br /><br />And of course, GONE GIRL would be a terrific movie in the right director's hands. But read the book first, it is much better than any movie adaptation could be.
B006RUJST6|5.0|A must read! Loved every character. could not put this book down. I can't wait to read the next book!
B002K0WBXW|5.0|Title says it all. This is a fun movie that I thoroughly enjoy; great to lift your mood and have a good laugh. It has quick wit, perfect casting, and a nice story. It's a great chick flick, but can also be amusing for guys. Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock have amazing chemistry as their hate/love relationship unfolds, and they're just so damn sexy. Plus, there is an adorable, fluffy puppy in the movie. You can't go wrong!

SO DONT BE A HATER!!!!!!!!! :D

B001N1DPDE|5.0|I have not put this knife through the ringer yet, but I am sure it can take anything I can dish out.  I understand some people's criticisms that this knife is a jack of all trades, but master of none.  It could be used to do almost any outdoors task, including being used as a pry bar, but it is so big and heavy that it would not be good for fine cutting work (like a mora, or something lighter and smaller).  That being said, if I could have only one knife in the woods, it would be this knife because it could be used for anything, including things that a smaller knife could not do.  The thing I like the most about this knife is that if I severely damaged the edge, I could have it re-grinded because the blade is so substantial.  I saw a test in a blade forum that involved a guy absolutely torturing this blade (cutting up a lawnmower, a refrigerator, even a cinder block), and the guy was able to re-grind the blade to almost new.  After purchasing it, I now understand why.  I think it could last a lifetime even if occasionally abused in the way a normal knife shouldn't be.  Now for the minor gripes... The blade's edge was not very sharp out of the box.  This is not a big deal for me because I usually sharpen blades myself when I get them.  Not many companies put a razor edge on knives at the factory anyway.  I have found that Mora puts an incredible edge on their knives (especially considering the price) and that my SOG seal pup elite was razor sharp out of the box, but Ka-Bar and Ontario only put adequate edges on their blades.  Again, no problem because you need to be able to sharpen/resharpen your own knives anyway.  Also, I don't care for the sheath.  I have not witnessed the dulling issue that some have had, but I don't like the nylon belt loop.  I might buy the blade tech attachment to replace the nylon, or get a custom sheath.  The nylon just isn't sturdy enough and makes it difficult to remove the blade with one hand.  Other than those two gripes, I couldn't be happier.  Some people really bashed this product in reviews because they hated the sheath.  To be honest, I haven't purchased many reasonably priced blades that came with good sheaths.  And, this is not an \\"expensive\\" knife in the vast world of blades.  The blade itself, which is why I bought it, gets 5 stars.  The sheath would get two and a half.  Since I am rating the knife, it gets five.
0345803485|1.0|I get why woman love the book.  Christian is a man's man in a metro world where men is mice and woman is a vice.<br />I get why woman hate the book.  It has sooo many underlying dangers, but no, I do not believe that other 22 year olds will not be able to discern between fiction and reality.  According to me, the biggest danger is this, Have sex and meet your inner goddess, no sex, no goddess and then lastly be stupid and you will get the ultimate male.<br />So is the sex scenes, too much, too detailed, too repetitive, seriously if it were not for the sex scenes, I would not have read past her first inner goddess apparition.  It is hot and detailed.  It is the rest of the book that bored the crap out of me.....<br />Think on this people, if this should portray our pop culture and thus our ideal lives, we may need to consider using labels differently.  Oh, and me may try to think of what it is we are drooling over. Consider Grey's statement, I am 50 shades of fd up
0345525558|5.0|I found this book to be beautifully written and even magical in places.  The characters were very interesting and it was wonderful when Victoria was finally able to communicate her feelings through flowers<br />and to connect with people that came along after her sorrowful childhood.  Although there were times that I would have liked to shake Victoria, her behavior was more understandable considering the painful life experiences she had in foster care.<br /><br />I didn't want this book to end.  The writing was excellent and very touching and I highly recommend it.  I just hope that this very talented author continues along this route since subsequent books are very often disappointing when compared to a debut like this one.

1936608898|5.0|Melissa and Dallas have created a true work of art.  \\"It Starts With Food\\" is possibly the best nutritional advice for the modern world.  Their advice is based on good science. The book is easy to read and understand. I wish I could give everyone I know a copy.  It can change your health.  It certainly did mine.  I attended one of the Whole9 seminars a couple of years ago and it has definitely changed the way you think about food.
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|I love novels about witches, vampires, and otherworldy creatures.  I've read Anne Rice, Kelley Armstrong, and some of Charlaine Harris' novels, and enjoyed them all, some of them I would even say I loved.  This book started off really well, and had an engaging premise, vivid descriptions, and lots of magical and vampirical potential.  Then the book started to go nowhere plot wise, but that was alright as characters were fleshed out and given out personalities, and some deep background was revealed.<br /><br />Then the book started to go nowhere as page after page was written detailing the strong emotional pull the two main characters felt for each other.  OK...then the book kept going over the same emotional crap for page after page without any magic, mystery, or ANYTHING happening.  I put up with this for about 150 more pages, and then said to myself, \\"How much more time am I going to give this book to see if it lives up to the potential it showed earlier?\\"<br /><br />I returned to Amazon and this time read some of the reviews, a majority of which seemed to echo my thoughts about this book going nowhere.  I gave it three more chapters, and had had it.  I normally don't read 50% of a giant book like this without even skimming to the end, but I like myself too much and decided not to be mean to me, so I stopped.<br /><br />I don't recommend this book to anyone. Unless you like the kind of book I described.

034580404X|1.0|...not in \\"the good way.\\" For an older woman, spending time trying to read this is like being stuck taking care of a whiny, self agrandizing, moody, annoying 15 year old girl who is sexually active but has no clue what she is doing. If there was ever a character that epitomizes the old adage that, \\"youth is wasted on the young\\", it is Anna, Perhaps if we didn't have to suffer through her personal thought process and just got on with the sex bits, this might have been half the difficulty to read. As it is, I got to about 4 chapters into the second book, hoping it would get better, and after the helicopter crash and missing person drama, the flight to Florida,the cushy job for a kid one week out of college that turns into a whole company handed to her-passing over everyone else at the firm whose was a million times more qualifed, the two formal events-one where she is \\"auctioned off\\", the creepy older pedophile/businesspartner, the stalker ex-sextoy and only THREE WEEKS HAD GONE BY, I threw the book across the room and gave up on it. Anna and Christian have not only personal baggage and issues for a real therapist, they have a freaking lost and found luggage department that would make the collection at LAX look small.<br /><br />If you're over 40 years old and want to read something steamy and sexy and still feel like an intelligent human being when you're done, read something more like Tales of Fire by Pandora Bleue. LOTS of sexy heat and none of the stupid.
B002J2PB10|5.0|What can you say? Everything this guy makes is awesome. My all time fav list is his resume and this just added to that list.

B001VLXNO2|3.0|I know very little about the history of Everest, but even a few minutes of research after finishing this book indicates that many of the events and descriptions in this novel appear to be completely fabricated, which seems a damn shame when you are fictionalizing an actual historical figure.<br /><br />The characters were nothing special, the writing itself was not actually that great, and yet I found myself intrigued, constantly wanting to pick the book up again. Perhaps the subject matter was calling to me (I actually spent most of the book hurrying up so I could get to Archer's coverage of the climbers' last moments), but I have to admit that something kept the pages turning. I was quite disappointed that the narration stops before the climbers get into their fatal bind, which means we never find out how Archer thinks they died - the most poignant possible scene in the book.
055277832X|1.0|Why are they claiming this is a NEW book when I read it ages ago? My advice to anyone who likes the Shopaholic series is to go back to the first one and see how many times they've released her old books as \\"New\\".
B0086700CM|5.0|First of all, I love this app, though I have a few ideas that could help make it better:<br /><br />1. when the center and other side of the wall is gone, make it so the monkeys aren't running in midair.<br />2. when you are invisible, you should be able to stumble without the monkeys appearing behind you.<br />3. every now and then after getting a certain score, you should have a bonus/jackpot stretch where all the coins are blue.<br /><br />keep up the great work!

B006RUJST6|5.0|This was just what I needed right now. It was a nice romance with a plot, substance, and awesome characters that I adored! I loved how family was so important to these characters and how they fight to keep their family together and when they don't have a lot of people in their family, they become close with their friends and support each other like family. Made me smile.<br /><br />I read both of the books in this series in less than 24 hours, loved them!<br /><br />I just loved it and plan to re-read it!<br /><br />I hear this author has a third book coming out in September in this series, I will be all over that! :)<br /><br />Definitely a new favorite author to follow! <3

B008IJT0CE|5.0|After I bought this for my Huawei Springboard tablet, I was having trouble with it not showing all the sounds advertised.  The developer's support team helped me fix the problem and now I'm enjoying the full range of sounds and binaurals. I use this application for falling to sleep and relaxing.  It even helps put me in a sort of 'zone of concentration' when doing tedious tasks like data entry. I like that you can create your own favourite mix and it will save that. I would love the iOS version's feature of waking alarm as well (although I have another app for that, this has a greater range of sounds).  Perhaps in future updates....
B008JH5CVS|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  I typically lose interest if the film has too much action, in part, because I watch on a computer and do not own a TV. On my screen the scenes filmed in dark are very hard to see. Adept cinematography and lighting let me see this action.  The credits state that this is from an original idea by Luc Besson.  Luc is a good film maker but this is hardly an original idea.  It is very much like the John Carpenter  \\"Escape From....\\" franchise.  Guy Pierce gets to be the Snake Pliskin character.  He even smokes and makes Pliskin like jokes.  Maggie Grace is a sassy first daughter who needs rescuing from crazed prisoners on a space station isolated in orbit.  The bad guy from Fargo plays the bad guy from Washington.  The villains from the space station are over the top nasties.  A good group of characters smashing and bashing with good special effects.  I had a fine time.  And you....yeah you who is going to check this review as not helpful because you did not like the movie and think you are the only one who's opinion counts.  Knock it off.  I have noticed a trend on Amazon where fan boys either thumbs up or down any review that disagrees with them.  Everyone gets an opinion ....not just you.

B0034G4P8A|4.0|The worst part was waiting for the blue ray to be released so I could watch it when ever I wanted. The casting was wonderful and it was like the characters jumped from the two dimentional comic to the big screen.

NOT!
B000LB7G00|5.0|The 3Dconnexion SpaceNavigator is an amazing product. It works flawlessly, and saves you quite a bit of time while modeling. It's weighted quite well and stays planted on the surface you are using it on. Navigating through my models is so simple it actually feels like playing a video game and flying around. It is extremely responsive, and customizable enough that you can change settings to have it react exactly how you'd like it to. Now that I have it and have become used to it, I could never go back to just using a mouse. Thank you so much for such a great product.

B002ZB26AO|5.0|Many books about North Korea that I have read display the absurdity, pain, sadness, and blight existence of a nation gone rogue and gone wrong.  Its blatantly obvious through these texts, histories, and other news outlets that North Korea is one of the most odd nations in surviving in a post-Communist world for so long at the cost of a miserable livelihood brought together by mismanagement, extreme repression, and an Orwellian control system.  Testimonies, documentaries, and research, as well as visits to the low-key state bring about the same motifs of blind acceptance of their dear leaders, paradoxes in reality vs. what they are told, showcase capitals, and the true existence of North Koreans in the most heinous of circumstances all due to neglect.  So coming to read \\"Nothing To Envy,\\" I expected another matter-of-fact, been there, read that book that re-hashed these themes.  Instead I was truly surprised that Barbara Demick goes beyond her journalistic tendencies to create one of the finest works on North Korea out there.  If I were to recommend a book to someone who has never heard of North Korea, or is curious about it, I would drop this book on them.  Demick's collection of testimonies of several recent refugees from NK, weaving them into a novel-like narrative, while dropping crucial information between each section of dialog and story, is one that she pulls off well and draws out raw emotion from the reader without getting throwing politics in it.  Rather than Demick posing that North Korea is an evil state by giving her opinion like a sauce that she wants you to taste, she let's the testimonies themselves let you decide what to think, and there were times I shuddered at their former life and became thankful for what I do have, and pray for the people of North Korea.<br /><br />What Demick does rightly in the beginning of the book is to lay her cards on the table of how long the book took to research, interview, and compile the information together.  Also, she wisely says that though she has wholesale relationships and stories from the defectors, there are moments where she cannot corroborate them because obviously it is difficult to get information from within North Korea itself.  Then she begins her narrative.<br /><br />She runs through several refugees and their former lives, mostly from the city of Chongjin which is right near the Tumen River on the Chinese border.  Demick describes a young couple, Mi-ran, coming from a low-class of North Koreans because her father was a South Korean, and her boyfriend Jun-sang whose family had come from Japan.  Then she later tells the tale of Mrs. Song, a woman who was a stout believer in the Communist regime to the dotted i.  She thought that nothing could go wrong with their 'eternal' leader Kim Il-sung.  There's Dr. Kim, a petit trained physician with an iron will to do what is right.  Demick describes these and others as normal human beings where they grow up and knew nothing else of their outside world and what they believed what was normal.<br /><br />In between each story and chapter Demick describes in more details/historical analysis of North Korea that gives background to each person's existence, such as the Communist nation's supposed equal status for everyone though they officially classify people based on their loyalty to the state, which has effects even on how much food rations that they could receive.  Or what happened to Mi-ran's father, a former South Korean POW, and what happened to these people of circumstance who were not allowed to go back home.  She describes in great detail the political state structure that creates an environment of mismanagement, like the infamous collective farms or the post-war fall of Communist regimes that led to less support of the Korean regime.  Demick balances a human narrative with a historical background so that you identify with the palate of emotions these people go through while getting the necessary information of understanding their circumstances.<br /><br />The book climaxes with the disastrous famine that occurred around the time of Kim Il-sung's death and towards 1998.  Millions died.  Famine became noticeable when their food rations were cut.  This is the most difficult part to read: there were moments I cringed on how hunger made people turn to beasts or opportunists at the expense of others.  People of Dr. Kim's profession, a noble one, were forced to hunt in the mountains and hills for food and medicine.  Or watching young children die of malnutrition.  At the same time Demick doesn't write a section on blasting Kim Jong-il's regime.  Yet the horror stories of lack of food and the absurdity of the government's \\"let's eat two meals a day\\" paints the worst sin a government will be ultimately judged by:  inaction and neglect.  At this time the author puts in a new view of how North Koreans survived, and it was at times ugly and illegal (at least according to their law), but they managed to survive.  She describes Chongjin's citizens doing what it takes to trade, barter, or steal to put some substance in their bellies, even if it couldn't be digested.  The section about orphans who pick up scraps off the ground was heartbreaking.<br /><br />The final sections of the book describe the the eventual danger and migration of the refugees out from North Korea to China to South Korea.  The dangers of crossing, checkpoints of getting across to another country and their repatriation laws, surviving to the dangers of exploitation, finally to the promise land.  And even there our North Korean friends we read about have more gut-wrenching moments of regret in leaving their homeland and the culture shock that follows from adjusting from state control, \\"you follow me\\" to land of opportunity.<br /><br />Again, one of the best reads on North Korea to date.  I enjoyed reading Demick's writing style and putting together a story, not an informative, static, long newspaper article about North Korea.Its quality is renowned for good use of language, like describing the love story of Jun-sang and Mi-ran that makes you know that under the umbrella of repression and absurd rules, love abounds.  How Demick describes how the darkness of night due to the lack of electricity proves to be the couple's ally in having an innocent love.<br /><br />Sometimes its what we don't have, or what we read others don't have, that makes us appreciate life and moves us to change for something better.
B008JAGZDE|4.0|For those that watched the original American Pie years ago, this to me was the true sequel to the original. It nailed the feeling of the original movie and the characters were all played pretty well. There was definitely a feeling of nostalgia watching the movie and their age is pretty close to my own which made me more aware of the guys being older with their own lives and problems now. There were a few one liners that didn't go over well and a couple of slow parts, but overall this was a good movie. I look forward to continued reunions as the cast ages. Maybe one day we will see American Children, and see how the current group of guys deals with teenagers of their own.
B001L5SXQG|4.0|This disk is good.  Not as good as The Rising or Wrecking Ball.  The fact that Obama used it during his campaign ruined the title song for me.  I still love Bruce anyway because he is The Boss.  If you like Bruce then buy this.  If you don't like Bruce then don't bother because he is rich enough already.
B0081L37Z0|3.0|This is one of those movies where you have to watch it and spend some time thinking about how you really feel for a day or two. Somehow the movie manages to hit both being good and somewhat bad depending on which part of the movie you are watching. There were some hilarious one liners throughout the movie, and the chase scenes where nothing blows up were great, but other parts just seemed unrealistic or slow. I personally was not a fan of Ice Cubes over the top character and that was one of the low points of the movie for me. If you are looking for a movie to rent and waste a couple of hours with some popcorn then its worth it, but it fails to be consistent from beginning to end. I did enjoy seeing Johnny Depp and Peter Deluise near the end as an added bonus, and the cast did a decent job, but at times this movie just didn't do it for me.

B007MJT1K2|3.0|I must say that I looked forward to this movie more than it deserved. The premise, as promised by the trailers, was intriguing and promised to be very entertaining. The animation was superb, making physically impossible feats seem quite reasonable, even probable.<br /><br />The problem is, so much time was spent on the look of the movie, the story line ended up getting the short end of the stick. So much was crowded into each sequence that the film ended up seeming like a series of loosely connected vignettes. The producers should have opted to make two films, with the last three sequences being a separate sequel. That would have allowed for more character development, and more screen time for the dog, clearly the smartest one in the film.
B006WAIV6M|5.0|Amazing reading on habit formation, which you can read across for your own habit formation process. Great sum-up of recent scientific research. Combine it with mindfulness literature and this is the way to go, if you're interested in personal change.

B00452J5EG|5.0|Soaked in primordial sludge, this swift electric kick to the teeth beautifully, stunningly spits in the face of everything that I thought was possible in contemporary music; a velvety swath of brilliance, choking on the fumes of its own black exhaust. These two musicians managed to produce a sound at once familiar and yet tangibly unique, all in the same breath.<br /><br />I recall picking the album up on a lark back in 2005. When I went to play it, not paying any attention, I started with side two and when I dropped that needle on \\"At The Back Of The Shell\\", I froze where I stood, having no concept of what I was hearing. It was a kind of ear candy, suspending me in disbelief at what I can only describe as one of a very few select listening experiences of my life. To this day, the only way I can listen to this album is side two first. It had that kind of affect on me. That I introduce it to people in that fashion is a testament to its lasting impression.<br /><br />Now, I understand that my opinion as expressed here is clearly biased, but all I can say is that this album is a very rare piece of music that has that kind of affect.....and I just had to be honest.
B007SGM084|5.0|I was not sure I wanted to read this book after I read all the reviews. I love to read all kinds of books (fiction, non-fiction, cookbooks, how-to books), but especially romance and sexy books (my daughters description). I am a teacher, so I had not heard all the hype on tv, but I kept seeing this on the top of the best sellers list for the Kindle. Well, summer vacation came, we had a cruise planned and I needed something to read. Boy, did I read and my husband loved it. yes, there is a story; yes, you do need to read all the books for it to really come together; yes there is sex that many people are not used to thinking about; yes, it can seem to be in this day and age that a college grad is a virgin (yes there are those girls out there, don't believe all college kids go to party); yes a cougar did take advantage of a young man (tv even likes those shows); yes a rich 20-something goes after the poor young girl (this story is played out in many books for a long, long time); yes this is fiction and yes, when you see someone reading their Kindle and smiling, they may very well be reading this book. I did say yes to the trilogy and loved the escape from my reality of caring for kids, parents, cleaning house and work life. this is like the bubble bath commercial; \\"Calgon, take me away\\". and yes, that is why I read, to go someplace else. I shared passages with my husband (he did not have the time to read the books like some of his friends, but loved hearing about them) and told my friends the books were well worth the investment of time and money (wink-wink). I did not tell my mother!!!! (these are things you talk about with friends and lovers, not your elderly mother or your teenage daughter) My mother does watch daytime talk shows, loves to read and heard all the hype. I told her she would not like these books, but she kept bugging me about them. She went to the local library to find the books and ofcourse they did not have them. She started asking her friends and sister if they had the books; she even asked my niece! so that she would not keep asking me and everyone else about the books, I just ordered the box set to be shipped to my mother. I am going away for a week. I hope she doesn't want to talk about it when I get home....maybe mom just needed an escape too. **if you go to E L James website, she does have a link the songs mentioned though out the books. this adds even more to the story and many are on my ipod (even before I started reading)

B0047Y17P2|5.0|I have read only one other Lincoln Lawyer book, and so I am new to Michael Connelly.  I thoroughly enjoyed the courtroom drama in this book, the theories, the techniques used, the writing and the character development.  There is a surprise ending, but it did not ruin my enjoyment of the book. When I can't put a book down, I know it is good!  Very exciting and suspenseful.  Can't imagine the low ratings that put this at 3 stars; it deserves 5 stars.

The mountaineer breaks his leg on a climb in the Peruvian Andes and his co-climber is forced to cut his life-line rope when he goes into a free fall ascending an ice face.  Heeding an inward voice Joe is able to miraculously escape the crevasse into which he falls and then hops and and drags himself to the Base Camp with excruciating pain, thirst and fatigue threatening to overwhelm him every feet of the considerable distance he has to traverse.  Amazing tale of survival !

B004BLDD9Y|1.0|UPDATE 9/11/12<br /><br />The first bulb I bought which I installed in my central hallway has burned out after a little more than 2 months of use.  It was installed on July 4th and burned out on September 11th.  My hall light is on most of the time (it is really only out when no-one is at home).  I would estimate the bulb lasted 600-800 hours....very disappointing.<br /><br />----- earlier review<br />Not much to say about this product.  It does appear to be the same brightness as a 50W bulb as advertised.  I placed this one in my central hallway which is lit almost all the time I'm home (I previously had a CFL in that location).  In 10 years I think this fixture has had two CFL's replaced since it's on about 14 hours a day (it's off when I leave for work).  The light is a slightly yellow warm white.<br /><br />The nice thing about this bulb is that it is almost exactly the same form factor as regular lightbulb, so it should be able to fit in any normal fixture.  This was a problem in one of my bathrooms with a very tiny fixture. I think a good pricepoint for this type of light would be about $5-$7.  The current $10 (at the time I'm writing this) is a little bit high, but would be fine if you need it for a fixture that is lit most of the day.<br /><br />It would have a cost savings even against a CFL, and certainly against a regular bulb.  If you are replacing a conventional incandescent bulb, this bulb should have a pay-back time of only about 1400 hours if your local electrical cost is $0.12/kW-hr.  If you replacing a CFL this would have a much longer payback time (several years), since a CFL is already very efficient.  If you factor in the cost of the CFL, and that these last much longer than a fluorescent bulb, the payback gets much better, again on the order of 1000-2000 hours (depending on the life-span and cost of the CFL you are replacing).<br /><br />You should be aware that while these bulb have an extremely long life span (great for those really hard to reach fixtures), they do very gradually get dimmer over the years.

B005LAIGPU|5.0|Stop me if you've heard this one: three kids mysteriously gain super powers....<br /><br />So these kids... they aren't friends per say, but they grow close due to their powers. In a series of learning to use their powers, the situations escalate until... well. Let's just say the words 'Boss Fight' sum it up well.<br /><br />The digital fx are, at some times, pretty obvious (even the composite shots look questionable), but it is easy to over-look. The acting is actually pretty good. I mean, no one's getting an Oscar for this film, but the characters are fun to watch: learning to use their powers brings them much closer and they try to support each other...<br /><br />The director's cut adds some good character moments managing to not drag the film down too heavily and for the most part were seemingly cut just for the sake of time. That ends the specials of this BD - there's like ONE deleted scene, some pre-viz, a bit on camera testing (kinda of raw footage with a few kids who were not actually in the film)a trailer, sneak peaks and soundtrack info.<br /><br />If you like origin stories of the heroic bent towards superpowers, you can't go wrong. As common as it is in the film industry today, it's the characters and the situations they find themselves in - that is why we watch the flick.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Good puzzle game, I like that our doesn't have a time limit on the free play mode, giving it a contemplative pace. The controls are sometimes a bit laggy on my htc thunderbolt.
B004LWZW7O|4.0|While I am sure that when a movie is released by a major distributor (e.g. Fox), they must have certain expectations. The film must appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Limit the violence. Limit the foul language. And so on.<br /><br />So we are given poor tech specs: 109 minutes of the film as proper, a few deleted scenes, a 'making of', 5.1 DTS, and subtitles in English and Spanish. Nothing that adds to the value of the BD.<br /><br />Now the film itself has been 'discussed' from both sides, whether or not this movie can stand on its own. We have what amounts to families with monetary power and those who struggle day by day. This really could have been a good film to throw out and generate awareness of several sociological issues. But this movie is PG-13, so the film makers leave out any real meaningful moral points. This would have been rated R to make it worth while. But do we really want the morality tale?<br /><br />The acting is kinda wishy-washy. At times, Seyfried seems to have some trouble finding her character. And at times Timberlake thinks he's an action hero. But you know what? If you can get past these points, what is left is an enjoyable film, supposing you can turn off your brain and just go along for the ride. YMMV.

0743455967|5.0|I'm writer, and I decided that I really want to see how Stephen King actually writes his stories, and I really enjoy some of his biggest titles. And if you're not a writer but still wondering how he writes, here it the answer.<br /><br />The first part of the book explains his life. Some of this is flat out funny, and other parts you really just felt bad for him (like getting a needle in his ear). Then he begins to talk life during writing of his first published novel Carrie, which is actually his fourth novel, and the event that led on, such his drug and alcohol abuse and he overcame it.<br /><br />The seond part of the book begins with \\"toolbox\\" that his uncle carryed with him. King than uses that image to help the writer to understand how to become a better or a kick a** writer. Then King goes way more into detail about how to set up Plot (which he actually doesn't, he lets the story flows), character development, theme, and what to use in setences and what not to use. These advices were very helpful, and biscally he was telling the truth flat out on really how you should write.<br /><br />The third part is his accident, and he really goes in detail and how he overcame this experence.<br /><br />The last part he gives you the ever first draft on \\"1408,\\" and he also shows you how he edited the story and explains why he made these corrections in steps afterward. And after that, he gives you some of the books he read and enjoyed.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I think these Sherlock Holmes movies are as good and probably even better than most of the action films out there these days. As long as you can put aside any preconceptions you may have had of Holmes from the books, you can completely enjoy Downey's portrayal of the great detective. A recent reviewer compared the action to a James Bond film. I'd agree, but then I'd say that this is a cerebral Bond set in the 1890's, within the gritty atmosphere of industrial Europe, a Europe on the verge of nationalism and warfare. For the most part, the action moves along nicely. My only criticism of this movie is that it should have done a bit more to set up the rivalry between Holmes and Moriarty (as genius vs. genius). Instead, it relied primarily on Moriarty's continued threat to his partner Watson as the main reason their personal conflict. In this way, Moriarty comes across as more of a sadistic evil than an intelligent evil. Like the first movie, A Game of Shadows looks fantastic. The atmophere of this film depicts the era wonderfully. Yes. This version of Holmes is a bit wacky, but this is my kind of movie!!

0143120530|5.0|I read this book in the hope of better understanding how Memory works and how to hold on to and improve my aging own. I did learn it from it certain tips, such as remembering in clusters, or multiplying the associations with a certain particular I might want to remember. I did not however really get something very fundamental in the book, the basic major memory technique of Simonides, of how to make spatial images the key to remembering. This is my fault not the book's which explained this repeatedly.<br /> The story of Foer's own meetings in the world of memory - experts and his development into being an expert himself was interesting. Foer was modest and wisely self- critical. The tone of the book is good and it is very intelligent. For anyone interested in Memory it is surely a worthwhile read.

B004LWZW6U|1.0|I would agree with another reviewer here--I paid $1.20 to rent and I was robbed. Dont waste your time with this piece of crap.<br /><br />I liked the first Piranha 3D. It was fun, gory and not to be taken seriously. This one..well, it's another example of when Hollywood no-talents (writers, directors, producers I'm talking to YOU) need a paycheck there is no level to which they will not sink to. Somebody related to somebody else who is friends with so and so has a few bucks. Let's make a SEQUEL!!!<br /><br />Stupid \\"jokes\\". Dumb scenes wasting the few B list actors present. Decent production values but anyone with a computer can do that nowadays. Lots of crappy rock music and scenes of topless chicks. Late in movie crowd in pool attacked by piranha but far far less than the pandemonium that occurred in the first movie attack scenes.<br /><br />Absolute, total, pitiful, boring, mindless, uninspired dreck. I suggest sending your nasal pickings to the writers courtesy of the film studio attached to this horrible, unwatchable thing.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This set contains so much content that it took me near a month to go through it all! They've collected every possible interview, TV special, and special featurest from previous special edition releases be it VHS, Laserdisc, DVD's, and a couple new ones for the Blu-ray edition. Every film comes with the original theatrical release, and the directors cut, and each film has a few different commentaries with either the directors or the actors or someone involved or influenced by the film. The set contains 6 discs packaged BEAUTIFULLY, in a book of a thick paper/cardboard like stock. Each disc is slipped in a sort of sleeve that has a brief description of the film, the director, and a little artwork pertaining to the film itself. The book itself is housed in a sleeve with a design that shines and complements your shelve wonderfully. I cannot recommend getting this collection enough!

B008IJTFYW|4.0|This has a lot of bells and whistles.  Loads of different sounds to play with over and above the traditional rain, ocean, white noise etc...  But some of the sounds need some work.  For instance the campfire doesn't really sound like a campfire.  It sounds a little bit like your in the middle of a room that is burning down if that makes sense.  I couldn't find a timer feature on it, maybe there is one but I could not find it... that would be a nice addition.  Other than that I think it is a great app.

B0011Z77OK|5.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers' GREATEST HITS does its job well, but it doesn't quite encapsulate the band all that well (especially now after a few recent albums).  This review will cover the good things, the bad things, and the weird things about this compilation.<br /><br />THE GOOD:<br />GREATEST HITS does a good job of collecting many of the band's singles from their \\"alternative\\" years.  Many of these songs aren't just good songs for RHCP, but some of them are great examples of the music genre.  \\"Californication,\\" \\"Under the Bridge,\\" and \\"Higher Ground\\" (along with plenty other songs on this collection) are timeless.  This release serves as a good primer for the band to new listeners.  This collection also includes two new songs: \\"Fortunate Faded\\" and \\"Save the Population.\\"  The first of these songs is quite excellent; \\"Save the Population\\" isn't so great though.  Longtime RHCP fans would be better off just buying these songs separately, as there's really not much reason to purchase this release otherwise (no remastered tracks, etc...)<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />This greatest hits package leaves out a wealth of material from the band's early years (first three studio albums).  This may have been in part due to the release of [[ASIN:B000SX8AII WHAT HITS?]], but there is some overlap between the two compilations.  At any rate, GREATEST HITS unfortunately doesn't include anything from the band's excellent [[ASIN:B0011Z92YS STADIUM ARCADIUM]].<br /><br />THE WHAT THE HECK?:<br />There's nothing represented here from [[ASIN:B00122AAL4 ONE HOT MINUTE]].  Sure, it's not the best album the band has released, but it at least had one nice hit (\\"Aeroplane\\").<br /><br />IN SUMMATION:<br />If you don't own any of Red Hot Chili Peppers' albums, GREATEST HITS is a wonderful place to start.  It's not the best representation of the band, but it's better than WHAT HITS?

B00122BEPA|4.0|Van Halen's greatest hits package THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS is pretty good.  There are a few things that are really frustrating about it, but for the most part, it serves as a good entry point for new Van Halen listeners.  Here's the good, the bad, and the what the heck?:<br /><br />THE GOOD:<br />The songs here are fantastic.  Most of the band's biggest hits and fan favorites are collected here on this double-disc collection.  These songs have been remastered, and they sound pretty good.  It wouldn't surprise me if another remastered version rolls around pretty soon though.  Van Halen's catalog of great songs is pretty staggering, and this release is justifiably 2-discs long.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />The \\"new\\" (they're not so new anymore I suppose) songs, \\"It's About Time, \\"Learning to See,\\" and \\"Up for Breakfast\\" aren't all that great.  The first of these tracks is pretty good, but compared to the rest of VH's hits, they pale in comparison.  One of the most frustrating things about BEST OF BOTH WORLDS is the fact that the band (or the label, I'm not sure who is to blame) released [[ASIN:B001FECIVE BEST OF VOLUME 1]], which collected a good smattering of Roth and Hagar, but it was never followed up with a proper Volume 2.  Instead, THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS contains many of the songs that were already collected on the previous BEST OF VOLUME 1.  Did you buy BEST OF VOLUME 1?  Well, this pretty much renders that compilation obsolete.<br /><br />THE WHAT THE HECK?:<br />\\"Eruption\\" begins this compilation, but it's quickly followed by \\"It's About Time.\\"  Everyone knows that the only thing that should follow \\"Eruption\\" is a shot of liquor and \\"You Really Got Me.\\"  Also, Gary Cherone is completely missing from this compilation.  I recognize that VAN HALEN III wasn't the best record in the world, and this package is called the Best of BOTH Worlds, but it almost feels like the band is trying to hide its past.<br /><br />IN SUMMATION:<br />If you're new to Van Halen, THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS is a no-brainer.  If you've followed the band for quite some time, the remastered tracks are nice, but the new three songs are worth the purchase without some consideration.OF BOTH WORLDS is a no-brainer.

0156012197|5.0|My mother read this book to me when I was a child and while I enjoyed the illustrations and the story line, much of it went over my head.  I've recently re-read this book as an adult and found myself underlining parts and pondering them, such as \\"But the eyes are blind. One must look with the heart.\\"  This is a treasure!
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I admit I didn't even know about these books until the TV show started and was between books at the time and figured what the heck and bought the Kindle edition.  The story line caught me on page one and didn't let go until I finished the book.  Great character development, excellent twists and turns, wonderful narrative.  I can't say anything bad here.  I usually don't like first person novels.  I always feel you miss something by not knowing other characters thoughs and feelings.  But I soon forgot it was first person and was caught up in the story line.  I've already recommended this to friends and am reading the second book in the series.  Johnson is now one of my favorite authors right up there with John Sandford.
B008COD5OO|2.0|PROJECT X is about \\"the most epic house party of all time.\\" Thrown as a birthday celebration by three unpopular high school boys, the party escalates rapidly until it hits unimaginable, chaotic heights. There really is no plot at all, unless you count a very predictable, very cliched love story that only pops up to give the lunacy some semblance of story.<br /><br />Whether or not you like the film will depend on just a few factors. Roughly half of the film is nothing more than music video montages of teens going wild, many of them in various stages of undress. If you don't count the opener and closer of the film, the end result is basically an MTV version of a softcore, barely legal porno. If that sounds like your bag, then buckle up. Be warned, though. This film has plenty of bodily fluids, but most of them aren't the result of pleasure, although viewers are treated to more than one shot of boys and girls emptying their bladders, which I guess satisfies the lusts of some people.<br /><br />The movie is really nothing more than an exercise in lust. The largest party I've ever been to was the Full Moon Party in Thailand; it was massive, chaotic, and there was a tent filled with injured and comatose people, but that still paled in comparison to this shindig. I only mention it here because I get the sense of wish-fulfillment that the producers of the film were appealing to in their younger viewers (if you don't count the last fifteen minutes of the party, when things literally and metaphorically go up in flames). Much like a real porno, the movie wants to submerse audiences in the environment and nothing more (hence it is portrayed as yet another found footage film), providing the experience of actually being there among the unaccountably huge ratio of gorgeous boys and girls doing everything but full frontal. As a thirty-something with most of his partying days comfortably behind him, though I found the whole thing monotonous and tiresome. Without a story to propel it, without interesting or unique characters (Costa, the sidekick responsible for the whole mess, is an unapologetically awful person and he becomes ever harder to stomach as the film progresses), and without any sense of direction or unity, this is less a movie than it is a visually arresting mess. Viewers hungry enough to be a part of its riotous energy -- those who dream of similar parties in their future -- they might be drawn in. However, those with more mature aspirations will probably find themselves quickly as sick of the whole thing as the hundreds of kids who, at the conclusion, are themselves puking all over the place.t, without interesting or unique characters (Costa, the sidekick responsible for the whole mess, is an unapologetically awful person and he becomes ever harder to stomach as the film progresses), and without any sense of direction or unity, this is less a movie than it is a visually arresting mess.

030758836X|2.0|I do not understand how this book has been reviewed so well.  It's so slow and boring with a lot of predictable plot twists.  You may not see the minor details of the twists coming, but the larger aspects of the twists are definitely predictable.  It's really easy to put things together almost right away and that's something I do not like in a book like this.  I think it's well written, but the plot sucks, and neither of the characters are particularly likable.  Amy isn't genuine and Nick is just some douche.  I didn't really feel torn or have any allegiance to either character because they are both bad people, but I think that's extremely important in a book like this.  There are points where the story is somewhat slow and moves along at a snail's pace.  I found myself struggling to get through it because it was so monotonous at points.  I just didn't like this book at all.
0143039431|5.0|Grapes of Wrath is historical work of fiction. Covering the migration of tens of thousands of tenant farmers from the mid-west to the West of America. The book is half-fiction and half historical narrative.<br /><br />Amazing and absorbing are two words that initially come to mind when recalling the story. We follow the Joads, a family of tenant farmers, from Oklahoma to California. The mid west has become a dust bowl and the crops are performing badly. The land owners are heavily indebted to the banks who call in their loans. The land owners have to bow as industrialization thunders down on them and tractors and massive earth moving machines plow and turn the land. The tenant farmers are evicted and slowly but surely, reality sets in. They have nothing but each other. All the work is out west they hear. Our story starts as they point the old jalopy west and set off for better days.<br /><br />Steinbeck writes the story from 3rd person perspective and writes using the vernacular one would hear if one were a fly on the wall. Only becomes On'y, something becomes sumptin, every becomes ever', family becomes fambly. After reading for a while, the voice in your head takes on a Southern drawl as you read over the exchanges of the family. Conversation is scant yet, succinct. Articulation is nonexistent but the emotion leaps from the page. It truly is amazing the amount of feeling Steinbeck manages to get across to the reader. You truly are in the wagon, tents, camps, fields with the Joads as their personal Odyssey develops.<br /><br />There are 30 chapters and every other one is a historical perspective that Steinbeck uses to color in the hurdles and forces working against the migrants who were headed West. These folks were treated with contempt, condescension, abuse, left to starve and physically abused by law-enforcement yet, they continued on their way with hope. The hope was eroding from within yet, onwards they went. Tight family units looking out for each other and helping others along the way.<br /><br />The characters all add their \\"something\\" to the story. One of the more interesting ones, for me, was the character Casey. Casey, an ex-preacher, is somewhat like the phone in the old movies. Someone would grab the phone and use it to fill in some parts of the movie. Casey has that role in some places. He's a thinker and we find him thinking and explaining things to the Joads as they come to terms with their predicament.<br /><br />This work is a classic, no two ways about it. It's an American Odyssey during the great depression. Down home, heart of the Nation people uprooted by progress and forced to adapt to a world that didn't want them. Excellent work.<br /><br />6 stars.elping others along the way.<br /><br />The characters all add their \\"something\\" to the story.

0756405890|2.0|The reason is that because the plot doesn't call for him to do anything. If at any point Kvothe were to pull his head out of his butt long enough to do something proactive the entire remaining premise of the story would fall down around him.<br /><br />MILD SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />The character spends three years in shock. Then one day decides to not be in shock anymore, pretty much just 'because'. What caused him to snap out of it? Someone he didn't know knew his name, and they also told a story that interested him. And then just like that - no more shock. I'm ready to be made whole again. During this three year period he was poor and living on the street stealing and begging. The entire time I was reading this part I was dumbfounded. Why not try to get an instrument? Or use any of the skills you learned from the arcanist you spent a year with? Do something, anything to stop starving. Stop being worthless. \\"Nope, can't do anything worthwhile. Too busy being in shock.\\" But you're learning plenty even though you're in shock - you've learned how to be a great pickpocket, how to lockpick, you know the streets of one of the worlds most complicated cities. You seem absolutely fine - in fact the only thing that appears to be wrong with you is that you refuse to even *try* and better yourself. \\"Nope, totally in shock. I stole your purse, set a fat kid on fire, and stitched up some wounds in my leg but I'm totally in shock and can't do anything worthwhile right now.\\"<br /><br />Why does he spend three years in shock being worthless? As near as I can tell it's just because he needs rough feet and the ability to pickpocket. He also learns to appreciate a warm meal I guess.<br /><br />OK, so after he's done being worthless he goes to the magic school and is a genius. But for some reason he makes enemies with absolutely the worst person to make enemies with. Over time this guy tries to ruin his life several times, eventually even trying to kill him. But our villain is too clever - he never does anything himself, he always hires middle men. Surely at some point Kvothe will actually try and stop this guy right? Maybe go around to some of the people who are badmouthing him and question them - look for evidence? No, no, that wouldn't work. Middle men. There are middle men, so why bother trying to defend yourself. Someone tried to murder you and you knocked them both out. OK, fine you ran away - good man. Going to get a guard to have them arrested? No... just going to run off. Clearly there is no reason to attempt to have someone that tried to murder you arrested. Just kind of... be concerned. Maybe spread some rumors that you're going to murder the next person to try such a thing.<br /><br />You know what's really funny? Anytime Kvothe farts and it smells a little off everyone hears about it. It's a big freaking deal. But he gets attacked? Every inn in the city refuses to hire him because someone threatened them? Nobody hears jack about any of that. Nobody in school is sitting around saying, \\"Isn't it weird that nobody wants to hire the best musician in the school?\\" Teachers aren't angry at him for 'conduct unbecoming' when word is out on the streets that he wants to murder the family of people that oppose him.<br /><br />No, everything that happens in the story is so painfully happening just for the sake of the story. At no point did I feel the events transpiring were organic - they always felt incredibly forced. Like the tenth time the character became poor again. Eventually you just kind of stop caring. An event doesn't happen to the character because it's interesting, it happens so that the next event will make sense.<br /><br />That being said - parts of the story are very good, or at least interesting. The few times Kvothe does actually do something it made me very excited and pleased. The writing style is interesting, but often I felt that it also kind of hurts the narrative. Introduce a character - this guy tries to kill me later. Twenty chapters later the guy finally tries to kill him. About time, it was getting annoying just sitting around and waiting for it to happen.<br /><br />The main character is interesting, but he's held up by an uninteresting (and often unimportant) cast of worthless side characters, and even worse than that dragged along from point to point in the story without meaningful or logical direction. The few times the character acts reasonably it's written as if it's some kind of miracle that he was able to 'get out of this one' but in all honesty I was sitting there the entire time wondering why the situation he was in was a problem when such a simple solution existed anyways.<br /><br />EXAMPLE:<br /><br />Early in his first term at school the character was told by a teacher to lead the class. Rather than backing down from said teacher he did so, and winds up hurting the teacher accidentally. He gets put on trial and the entire time he's freaking out about what he did. Finally he activates his plot device power, and calmed by it he.... tells the truth! Whoa! Amazing, that the truth, easily corroborated, would get him out of most of the trouble he's in. Why couldn't he have done this 4 pages ago? Because he was too buys doing absolutely nothing worthwhile!<br /><br />/EXAMPLE<br /><br />As I mentioned - the plot device power. The character has the ability to calm himself in any situation, allowing him a cool head that he can use to think things through clearly. He uses this power so randomly it doesn't make any sense. It's just there as a way for the author to periodically remind us that, \\"Hey guys, Kvothe is totes awesome!!!\\". When on trial - he uses it. When performing on stage - he uses it. When trying to calm down because his friend is wounded, or a dragon is around (not even directly threatening him) - nothing. He has no real reason to not walk around with this power active 24/7 but for some reason he doesn't.<br /><br />TL:DR - Here's my final word on the subject. The book is interesting, but I have no idea what the purpose of 90% of the story is. Anytime something can happen to advance the story Kvothe can't, won't, or just plain doesn't. He sits around being worthless until the author gives him permission to get off his ass and do something worthwhile, all the while shouting at us in blinding neon letters: KVOTHE IS THE BEST, SMARTEST, GREATEST, SEXIEST GUY EVER!

034580404X|1.0|These books are poorly written and show little skill at the use of language. the author seems to be more interested with sharing her fantasy's with the world then creating a erotic novel that is a literary work as well as stimulating to read. The most redeeming factor of the books is the erotic scenes but most of those also fall to stimulate the reader because of the writing level of the author. this book belongs on fan fiction sites or other free services, I would never recommend buying this book if your life needs more erotica look online there a millions of better authors.

B005LAIH9A|1.0|(1.) One indicator of a weak script is how many songs are needed as compensation for a vacuous story and to keep the audience engaged. Usually around 25 and you know you're in for a weak one, but to keep this one afloat took a near record 58 songs.<br />(2.) The next indicator is the continuing saga theme - part 2, or whatever. A noncreative retelling to the marketable audience of previous viewers still stuck (or wishing they were) in early life fantasies.<br />(3.) Another indicator of cheap is \\"Special Thanks\\" often totaling around a hundred or so local volunteers, but not in this case as they got the \\"Economic Development Team\\" from a small Georgia town to foot some of the bill - better than spending money on a boring education system. That, and reusing old props; keeping the sets to a minimal few localities; using low cost returning actors who have, over the intervening years, relied on TV sitcoms, video shorts, cartoon voice-overs and unknown forgettable B films for sustenance.<br />(4.) Who is our target demographic? Twelve to sixteen year olds and those who continued in that state having nothing more secure than in-your-face vandalism, potty jokes, alcohol/drug-of-choice quick fixes, bikini boob/ass fixation, and language reflective of a delayed mental development. America might slow it's decline if we enact a modified Sharia law on that infected male population. We would only lose 5 to 10%.<br />(5.)

Which is sometime okay, but this makes me think of all the discussion comparing this w/The Corrections: I preferred the earlier book precisely because, there, the dark tone was more often funny - here, I found the dark tone less often funny and more often just plain depressing.  Also, as one reviewer notes, there were truly long dead stretches mixed in here with other long fascinating stretches - I really think it would have been a better book at 100 or so pages shorter.  But Franzen can write, that is for sure, and, as I said, all that pain made the ending even more poignant.

B006LSZECO|5.0|I picked up this book at the recommendation of a friend, and I devoured it in about a week. I love books that surprise me and make me think, and Gone Girl definitely did that. I won't give anything away, other than to say that I was sincerely surprised at the outcome. I generally don't read mysteries/trillers/whodoneits, but I'm glad I made an exception for this one. I tend towards books with heavy character development, and that's what really drew me in - and kept me reading - about Gone Girl.<br /><br />The characters are expertly woven together, with bits and pieces from all parts of their lives. I felt like I really *knew* them by the end of the book (even if there were shameful, repulsive and unbelievable parts). Now - the ending leaves something to be desired, and I won't give anything away, but I wish it were a little clearer. I hate being left in the dark, but also love books that keep me thinking and discussing their plots well past when I've finished the book. This will be a novel I'll recommend to all my friends, just to see if their jaws drop like mine did.

B0085RZDJ8|5.0|BRAVO!!!!<br /><br />Will Grayson, Will Grayson is an exquisitely crafted novel told from two very different perspectives, two characters who happen share the same name.  Chapters are written by each of the Will Graysons' points of view, and as the chapters alternate between the two, so does the author.  One Will Grayson is written by John Green, the other Will Grayson written by David Levithan.<br /><br />Will Grayson is a clinically depressed teenager, who has a difficult time relating to anyone.  He is gay, but has not come out to his mom or friends yet, probably because he has very little faith in people in general and he doesn't trust them with something so huge.<br /><br />The other Will Grayson is a typical teenager with friends, a love for music and a flamboyantly gay, and larger-than-life best friend, Tiny Cooper, who is writing, directing, producing, and starring in his own autobiographical musical.<br /><br />Early on in the book, in a porn store in Chicago of all places, the two Will Graysons meet - and their lives are forever changed. What comes after is pure magic.  These two teenage boys, trying to figure out who they are and how they relate to the world, are brought together and form an instant connection through their shared name.  Even though on the outside they are quite opposite, on the inside, they aren't much different from one another...or anyone else for that matter.  They're like any of us at 16, trying to figure out who they are, learning to trust the world around them and the people in it, and overcoming the fear of telling someone you love them.<br /><br />Laughed out loud? Quite a lot, Yes.<br /> Shed a tear or two? Yes.<br /> Rooted for the characters? Oh my gosh,Yes.<br /><br />Note on the Audio:  Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant!  MacLoed Andrews and Nick Podehl deserve a standing ovation!!  Each narrator represents one of the Will Graysons in the novel, but both manage to nail Tiny Cooper's character, as well as belt out quite a few songs in the process.  I am sure I would have enjoyed the book, no doubt, but the audiobook was an experience!<br />I APPRECIATE YOU, TINY COOPER!!!<br /><br />Perfect for audio, WILL GRAYSON, WILL GRAYSON is on my required reading list for all YA-lovers out there!ongs in the process.

0785126708|2.0|Hulk was sent away from Earth in a spaceship by Reed Richards, Tony Stark, Dr Strange, and Black Bolt, because he's too dangerous/unstable. He winds up on an alien planet where he goes from being a gladiator to their king, falling in love and becoming a father (all of these events take place in &#34;Planet Hulk&#34;). That is until the spaceship he arrived in blows up killing a million of his alien chums along with his pregnant wife. Oh Hulk is maaaaaaaaaaaaad. So here he goes, on a new spaceship headed straight for Earth to begin... World War Hulk!<br /><br />Whenever I meet people who snort and turn their noses up when I mention that I'm a grown man who enjoys reading comics, I make the argument that comics are more than simply men in tights flying around the place doing impossible things (though a Superman book here and there is great fun); comics are a more sophisticated, complex, and infinitely artistic medium than to be dismissed outright as serious literature. Superhero comics too have come a long way since the Golden Age and are more than just toy figures fighting one another - just look at the work of Alan Moore, Grant Morrison, Warren Ellis, Garth Ennis, and so on.<br /><br />But books like &#34;World War Hulk&#34; undermine my argument because in this book Hulk batters one hero after another until it becomes representative of the worst excesses the medium offers. It is the stereotype that people who don't read comics think of when you mention comics. Hulks fights Black Bolt and wins; he fights Iron Man and wins; he fights the Fantastic Four and wins; it's just so tedious to read. Hulk smash, blah blah blah, who thought this was a good idea? Is the Hulk literally invulnerable? It seems so. Well that makes for an interesting read, having a main character who can easily defeat any obstacle in his way.<br /><br />Black Bolt is described as being the second most powerful superhero in the world (despite living on the moon) yet Hulk defeats him. How? There's no mention in the book how, it just happens. Thor is noticeably absent in the book - if ever there was a significant threat to Hulk, it's Thor (despite the scene from the Avengers movie showing him as somewhat less tough than Hulk - you know the one I mean).<br /><br />Despite Greg Pak's efforts to make Hulk seem more than the indestructible tough greenie who cuts through Earth's mightiest heroes with incredible ease, Hulk is revealed at the end to be the dummy he's always been portrayed as. He is easily manipulated into going into a rage by someone smarter than he is - I mean, why would Reed Richards et al. try to kill Hulk after the extensive efforts made to put him on a deserted planet where he could finally find peace? Why not destroy Banner when he was out cold when they put him on the spaceship headed to space? But if such glaringly obvious plot holes were pointed out there wouldn't be this book.<br /><br />And having Sentry show up in the final third - why wasn't he the first one to fight Hulk? Because he's agoraphobic. So what set him off to finally get involved? Again, if it was just Sentry fighting Hulk in the first place there wouldn't be a book. It's just so contrived.<br /><br />&#34;World War Hulk&#34; is a dumb comic book that would only appeal to kids who want to see these colourful characters doing nothing more cerebral than punching one another. It's like Royal Rumble with Hulk in the ring and every hero charging at him only to be, drearily, inevitably, rebuffed. The only interesting part was how such an unstoppable force of nature was finally stopped, which I'll admit was at least interesting and probably the only part of the book I thought was clever. But the rest? If all you want from comics is fighting, you'll love this - for everyone else, don't bother.mention in the book how, it just happens.

B004OCCFFI|5.0|For some reason FIDELIO has never been a favorite opera for this listener. True, the great Beethoven is almost beyond criticism, but the work has great moments separated by exceedingly mundane ones.  If the leads in the opera are not strong then the work is hopelessly tedious - for this listener.<br /><br />Then along comes this recording from the Lucerne Festival of 2010 with Claudio Abbado conducting the Lucerne Festival Orchestra in a well synchronized concept that manages to balance all parts of the opera and the entire work comes off making sense - and thrilling sense at that. Analyze the recording and the gleaming gold here is the radiant Florestan of Jonas Kaufmann.  His singing is not only perfectly pitched and technically brilliant, but it also conveys the drama that often is lacking n the voices of other tenors.  Nina Stemme is a credible Leonore and her voice is a fine complement to Kaufmann.  The other roles are adequately sung and the chorus is fine.  But the star here is Kaufmann who seems to increase in stature with every new role and every performance.  He is a treasure to hear.  Grady Harp, August 12
B000L212HC|3.0|We watched the movie last night and had problems from the beginning understanding the dialogue. The surround ambient noise level was high enough that it was difficult to impossible to hear what they were saying. Words are important in this movie and if they're that hard to understand then the movie is missing the mark. From what we could determine it seemed to have an interesting story and the acting we were able to hear and see seemed good.<br /><br />My system and its speakers are balanced to within 1/2 decibel so I can say the problem was not with my system; that means to me the audio mix was out of balance making it difficult to understand what was being said. It's hard to imagine something like that happening but our inability to hear the words suggested the problem was indeed a real one.<br /><br />In addition the movie seemed choppy, jumping around from scene to scene in a rather abrupt manner and making it difficult to follow the story. The combination of just those two elements made the movie simply not worth watching and we stopped watching it about half way through.<br /><br />I see many favorable reviews and truly wished we could have enjoyed it too. I suggest you rent this one before you buy and see how it plays out on your system first.
B003Y5H4Y8|5.0|I was fascinated by this movie with people having a debt by living a lie which comes back to haunt them.<br /><br />It started off as a good thriller, but then it just got better.  The story is good; the acting is good, and the characters are interesting.<br /><br />I recommend it as one of the best movies I have seen in quite awhile.

0142420891|2.0|I was disappointed in this sequel to \\"If I Stay\\".  The sorrow, the introspection, the fear, and the tremendous personal clarity and growth that emerge from Mia in the first book are just lacking in Adam's story in \\"Where She Went\\".  The dialogue seems contrived and shallow, except for a couple key moments. I had expected more of those just-need-to-stop-reading pages, where you have to exhale and dwell on the page, but that effect was lacking in \\"Where She Went\\".  If another sequel comes out, I'll skip it.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Not sure why people give this one star just because they can't uninstall it. That's not the apps fault that you bought a phone with pre loaded apps.

As a Nurse Practitioner I have recommended to several of my patients and also several family members.  If money were no object I would hand this book out to each of my patients.  I am looking forward to future books by the authors.
0812993292|4.0|A charming and touching tale told with humor and empathy. At first I wondered if I was going to enjoy this book as it seemed a bit trite and not likely to engage serious issues, but relationship issues, both between spouses and between parents and children, were actually a major part of this book. Back story is introduced on a 'need to know' basis, so that the reader fills in the blanks on reasons and  motive. Harold and Maureen are well rounded characters who engaged me enough that I was rooting for things to turn out okay between them at the end.

B005JE7WKI|5.0|I really appreciated the fun of the twist on plots of the genre. And I cannot stress enough how well Tucker and Dale were cast. Alan Tudyk has got to be one of the most underrated talents on the screen today and Tyler Labine plays perfectly the line between believable hillbilly and \\"maybe an evil crazy killer?\\" I have recommended it to friends and co-workers alike - not so much as some ground-breaking oscar film, but as a movie that is just plain fun.
B000002LQR|4.0|This is by far the best Chili Peppers album. It is impossible to explain to someone who wasn't of age at the time when it was released but in 1991/92 this album seemed so eclectic that it bridged the gap between Beasie Boys (RIP MCA), Guns & Roses, Parliament, Metallica and Nirvana. In 1992 through to 1995 I don't recall anybody not owning this album, that's how powerful it was (or was I just moving in the wrong circles).

This episode focuses of Cara Mason and how she came to be a Mord Sith. \\"Broken\\" also focuses on the power of forgiveness, remorse, and justice. In this episode Kahlan Amnell must use her authority as Mother Confessor to decide Cara's fate. There is a twist however, Cara was one of the Mord Sith that killed Kahlan's sister and nephew when she (Cara) was serving Darken Rahl.

The chase scene and the incredible costumes help to establish that this show is anything but ordinary.The viewers are instantly captivated by the stunning woman in white being chased by an army of men. This episode is the perfect beginning to an incredible tale of love, courage, struggle, and forgiveness. Plus there is some eye candy (Richard shirtless chopping wood). This show is a must watch!

B003QCCS36|3.0|I'm relatively new to Ray, so I feel like I can give an unbiased perspective. I like this album overall- it certainly has some beautiful moments and the pedal steel playing is outstanding. Lyrically, it can feel a bit forced and trite at times to me (particularly if you listen to something like the effortless beauty of Sam Beam's songwriting as Iron and Wine to make a current comparison). Still well worth purchasing. 3 1/2 stars

B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|Making their grand debut in 2000 with their phenomenal Hybrid Theory album, Linkin ParkLinkin Park became one of the most famous bands of the 00's. Combining musical genres--such as rock and rap--also made them one of the most controversial bands of all time. Since releasing Hybrid Theory have several albums been released--the likes of which include Meteora, Minutes to Midnight, A Thousand Suns, and finally Living Things<br />Throughout the band's course, however, its sound has gone through some dramatic changes. With Hybrid and Meteora, we experienced a very Nu Metal vibe--that is, with a lot of heavy-metal pieces while also mixing in rap. Minutes to Midnight, to me, seemed to place itself in its own category as the only one of Linkin Park's albums to \\"play it safe.\\" I say this because most of the songs were simple rock with almost no rap at all.<br />Starting with A Thousand Suns and moving onward, Linkin Park has kept their rock-and-rap sound and successfully implemented it into their music--only now with the addition of electronic sounds and pop. Such a pop-like sound would forever split their fan-base.<br />To be completely honest, I barely even care how much the music has changed. Others might argue that no sound of Rob's drums, Brad's guitar, or Chester's screams are heard in any of their new songs. If you believe that--if you want to hear drums, listen to In My Remains; if you want to hear guitar, listen to Burn It Down; if you want to hear screaming, listen to Victimized.<br />I can think of only one reason people wouldn't like Linkin Park's new pop-like style--and that's probably because the only things they can think of with this pop style are the songs from artists like Justin BieberJustin Bieber, Lady GagaLady Gaga, and even Rebecca Black. Once you look past the fact that a lot of our notorious musicians are technically in the same genre as Linkin Park, the music isn't half bad.<br />Only two years after the release of A Thousand Suns does Living Things hit the shelves. With music videos, advertisements, and plenty of lyric videos to comprehend, I think it's safe to say a lot of hype for this album has been weighted onto our shoulders in the past couple of months.<br />On June 26 did this album finally see the light of day in CD stores; such was when I finally bought my own copy of Living Things and popped it into the nearest CD player. In order from the first song played to the last, the list of songs goes: Lost In the Echo, Burn It Down, Lies Greed Misery, I'll Be Gone, Castle of Glass, Victimized, Roads Untravelled, Skin To Bone, Until It Breaks, Tinfoil, and Powerless. The only one of these songs I didn't like was Until It Breaks--but that's probably because too much of it was rap.<br />Lost In the Echo--as the first song of the album--does its job well in introducing us to the rest of Living Things. The song gradually builds up from an electronic beat to rap and finally to the rock-and-roll we've come to love and know with this band. From what I'm able to understand, this song talks about how somebody has been betrayed by a good friend--and are leaving that former friend forever.<br />For the next song, we have In My Remains. This song seems to me like a continuation of Lost In the Echo--as it explains the promises broken in the last song--but in greater detail. Overall, I think this song is just as good as the first.<br />The third song is regarded as the most famous of Living Things' arsenal of songs; it's Burn It Down. Besides being given its own music video, Burn It Down was hosted on the NBA Playoffs shortly after it was first revealed. The song itself has a very unique story to it, as it mainly involves the band and how they've changed. We're building it up to break it back down shows how Linkin Park once built Nu Metal up to its beak--and now they're moving away from it or break(ing) it back down.<br />Lies Greed Misery may seem like a harsh-sounding song during your first hearing--and in a sense, that's what this is. The fourth song of Living Things gives a sense of vengeance toward somebody who has caused great pain.<br />For I'll Be Gone, we get a sense of abandonment from an old friend. That's all I really have to say about this song.<br />Moving on to Castle of Glass, which is possibly the second most popular Living Things song--next to Burn It Down. The lyrics to this song seem to emphasize how miniscule we really are in comparison with the rest of the world. We don't really need to be anything else, according to this song.<br />Now for a song the long-time fans of Linkin Park will definitely enjoy: Victimized. A short 2-minute-long piece, Victimized comes equipped with screams, rap, and everything that made Linkin Park in the first place.<br />The next song--Roads Untraveled--almost made me cry. I say this and I'm not really one to allow a song--or any kind of media, for that matter--to take control over my emotions. Throughout the song's course do we hear an alternation between piano and hard rock--in addition to the switches between Mike's deep voice to Chester's high-pitched sweet vocals. This song seems to show how those who are feeling as if they have no friends will eventually find themselves at peace.<br />Skin to Bone strays away from the personal feel of the other songs--and into a more political sense. Right to left; left to right shows conservatism vs. liberalism. What I think they're trying to say here is how neither of the political sides are right--but only personalities matter.<br />Until It Breaks gives some very strong rap vibes in addition to some of Chester's soft singing sections--and finally it leads up into Brad himself singing. This is the first time we actually hear Linkin Park's guitarist actually sing for us--and it actually turns out to be a bit of a mixed bag. While I admire Brad's voice itself, I can't help but feel like the instrumentation for his part of the song sounded a bit out of place; it sounded like something I'd expect to hear in Pixar's \\"Finding Nemo.\\"<br />Tinfoil is nothing more than an instrumental song--merely a test of the band's abilities. The Hybrid Theory equivalent would be Cure For the Itch.<br />Finally there's Powerless: the conclusion to this musical masterpiece. For those of you who have seen Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Killer, this song should sound familiar. This song talks about how somebody has made a bunch of promises to somebody and how that person has deliberately betrayed them.<br />So overall, I think Linkin Park did a superb job once again. This may very well be their best album since Hybrid Theory--let alone it might be even better than Hybrid Theory. With all that said, I highly recommend this album to anybody who listens to music on a regular basis.'s what this is.

0345803485|2.0|This is the most repetitive and stale book I have EVER read. Ironically, it is meant to be a story that will inspire one to explore their own sexual fantasies and personal limitations. If this tale inspires you to be a little kinkier, your sex life must be as stale as this book. It is literally chapter after chapter of tired erotic scenarios where the main character orgasms five times per session as the male lead \\"finds his release\\" instantaneously. Speaking of which, someone sincerely needs to grant this \\"writer\\" the precious gift of a Thesaurus. Are you so painfully unimaginative that you can think of no other way to describe condoms and orgasms than \\"foil packets\\" and \\"finding his release\\"? I'm not talking once or twice, I am talking EVERY SINGLE time these two have sex, which is several times per chapter. Can you also think of no mannerisms for your already poorly developed characters than lip biting, blushing, flushing, eye rolling, finger knotting and chin tilting?<br /><br />This story resembles Twilight a little too closely for me to even grant this author the benefit of the doubt creativity-wise. A clumsy, awkward girl, unaware of her own beauty, falls madly in love with a wealthy, mysterious, potentially dangerous dreamboat that she can't keep herself away from. She has a safer, more down to earth man that she could choose (cough, Jacob, cough) but no, she stays with Christian (Edward) in an obsessive, teenage, immature love trance. Oh yeah, and the book is even set in SEATTLE, which as others have pointed out, the British author did not research the geography of.<br /><br />Lastly, the thing about this book that irks me the most is the inconsistency of the characters' personalities. One moment, they are fancy and decadent, enjoying classical music, luxury homes, luxury cars and pricey wine. While the next moment, they are rolling their eyes at one another, listening to Britney Spears, and referring to their genitals as \\"down there\\". So very hot and steamy, isn't it?<br /><br />My sole motivation to finish this book was the mere fact that it held the #1 spot on the Bestseller's list. As far as I'm concerned, this book is a blemish on the history of said list.  Even if I took the non-existent plot out of the equation, the author's skills as a writer are just not deserving of Bestseller's List attention.

B0086700CM|4.0|The game is pretty fluid compared to the original Iphone version, but the only problem I have is that - - &gt; A) The speed power up doesn't necessarily control you and you end up failing thinking it'll save you on its own. B ) The game overheats or just gives up and closes itself out while in the middle of play. All in all it's still with just a few minutes or kinks here and there.

I used to hate scraping the bugs out of it everyday or starting over with freezing cold water and this solves both of those problems beautifully! It fits like a glove, a perfectly sized pillowcase that slips right on even when I'm the only one there to do it, and the tie (which wraps around the entire base of the pool) holds it down in North Dakota winds! I loved the other reviewer's idea of putting a beach ball under it to prevent sagging, I will do that for sure! Happily using my pool everyday now!!

I noticed other reviewers said they did not receive the triggers pictured. I bought a different set of pelican triggers in a store and they are pretty much the same thing. If you order these you will receive pelican triggers and they will work well.

B004AYCWY4|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read. I'd recommend it to anyone - those trying to understand evolution to those who think they already understand it.
0345803493|1.0|If you enjoyed the first book of this trilogy (Fifty Shades of Grey), then you will love Fifty Shades Darker. I, however, was unimpressed with the second installment. It is very poorly written, difficult to believe, and resolves its best plot lines too quickly. Most readers know what they are getting into when they embark on this trilogy, I will not be making it to the final book.
0765324857|4.0|the is excilant from the point of veiw givin from andrew ryan as in the video games it does explain the making of rapture or of ryans life it does fill in blanks in the bioshock series but it is a little fast pace and does flow well with the flash backs from time to time you would only understand the book by playing both bioshock games to make any sence of what happened but the book does paint a glorious picture of the world then so i give it a 4 star mostly cuz im a diehard fan of the series but also cuz its my honest opinion
B006MPKE9O|3.0|Read the reviews and thought that I would give the series a read. I kind of liked the story but found it extremely heavy going to start and move through. You get swept up in the convolutions that add to the story, but happen in such a way that it is kind of like using a tornado to describe a breeze. The end wasn't overly predicable but you could see the parrallels between each timeline characters and it was either going to go one way or another. Just didn't grab me completely

B00866H7SS|5.0|It was well written, lost track of where I was up to, and only realised I had reached the end, when a preview of another book came up.  Great characters and can not wait for their second story.
B008BM9L72|2.0|Thank god i finally finished the last of the 'Fifty Shades of Grey' books last night.<br />Now i can read something good.<br />Sorry, but these books are boring.<br />I dont mind a good mummy porn book but these were just ridiculous.<br />About 3/4 of the way through book 1, i started skipping the sex bits because they were just so boring and pretty much all the same.<br />By the end of book 3, i think i must of skipped about 1/2 the books.<br />The actual story gets lost in all the sex.<br />The bits that actually could of been exciting (the ex gf stalker and the ex boss) were rushed and cut short way to quickly<br />I cant believe they are gonna make a movie out of these. It will be so boring.
0345803485|4.0|You know, it's a trashy novel folks. It's always about some chick whose never had sex, the guy she meets is always rich and there unfolds the story. It's nothing new. But this has been so much fun to read with my husband. Yes, we read it together at night when the kids are in bed. It's a fun way to unwind and spend some time laughing and talking about the book , characters and what not ;). It's what you make of it. It does sound cheeky in many parts but again, it's a cheeky trashy novel. You read the whole book so It couldn't have been that bad other wise you would have put the book down the minute you got bored or irritated and been done. I've been married for 17 years and this has definitely been the most fun I've had reading with my husband!!
B003TNM2K6|4.0|The army's \\"Arrowhead Project\\" has poked a hole into another dimension and it may be open for good. A massive and violent thunderstorm pounds a small town in Maine and does tremendous damage. David Drayton (Thomas Jane) takes his young son and his neighbor into town to get supplies and to see what is going on as the power is out. While at the grocery/hardware store an all obscuring mist rolls in and takes visibility to zero. The store is full of customers and a man runs in screaming that there is something in the mist. A man who goes outside is heard screaming and the customers close the doors of the store and prepare for the worst.<br /><br />The customers separate into 3 main groups, those who want to leave, those who want to stay inside and a group forms around a fanatic telling everyone it is the end of days. The store's generator shuts down and a clerk goes out to fix it and he is killed by a monster that attacks. A few try to leave but they either disappear into the mist or are heard screaming as they die....<br /><br />Stephen King's imagination runs wild in this story and the result is a very good storyline full of terrifying creatures let loose into this world. I am a Stephen King fan and own just about everything the man has written and I loved this story.<br /><br />Unfortunately the director and screen writers take liberties with the storyline and change the ending to create some closure that the novella didn't do. I feel that the ending of the movie is just too sad and for me I did not enjoy the movie as well as I enjoyed the book. It is still worth watching but just be aware that if you read the book that the movie is different.<br /><br />This movie features great special effects and they are right out of Stephen King's imagination. That part of the movie follows the book pretty well and I enjoyed it. The acting is very good and I even wanted to shoot Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden) who is the main leader of the fanatic group.<br /><br />Watch this movie; you will like it if you like Stephen King!ovie; you will like it if you like Stephen King!

B008MEM24S|5.0|We own Where's My Water on our Kindle Fire, iPads, iPhones and iPod and when I saw this game I just had to have it.  The price is just right!  I love these physics based puzzles with great graphics and challenges.  This is very similar to Where's My Water but I still enjoy it a lot.  I like having to figure out how to collect all the gnomes and finding the hidden items.  It also makes you think about which steps to do first and create a plan of attack.<br /><br />Disney makes some very good games that are fun to play, they have good graphics and they keep updating the game to add more playing levels at no addition cost.  The games are always worth the money for the entertainment and enjoyment factor. I like this game and I recommend it to you.  If you liked Where's my Water then this one has to be next on your list to purchase.

B001M72JC2|4.0|\\"The Butterfly Effect\\" is one of the latest movies to get the high-definition treatment from Warner Bros. Home Entertainment. It was available as a Canadian import as far back as 2009 but now it comes directly from the U.S. This new Blu-ray version comes with both the Director's Cut and the theatrical version. It also has an impressive amount of special features included.<br /><br />Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher) suffered from blackouts and memory loss most of his childhood. He keeps a diary of the events so he can read them later and remember what he did. After heading off to college, he begins to have the blackouts again. Evan soon realizes he has the ability to alter reality through time-travel.<br /><br />Directors / writers Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber created quite a thought-provoking and suspenseful movie here. It makes you think about your actions in life and the sort of repercussions they have on those around us. It's a disturbing reminder that the things we say and do really affect people.<br /><br />This was Ashton Kutcher's first real dramatic leading role and he handled it well. It can be hard to push the image of an actor's character out of your mind if it gets stuck in there. I think Kutcher's biggest obstacle was getting audiences to see him as anyone but Michael Kelso from \\"That 70s Show\\" at the time. He succeeded in my opinion.<br /><br />The high definition transfer of the film looks and sounds great. The picture is clean and clear. All the color levels are well preserved. The 6.1 surround sound disperses the dialogue, audio effects, background noises, and musical score successfully throughout a home theater.<br /><br />Bonus material in this version include four featurettes entitled \\"The Science and Psychology of the Chaos Theory,\\" \\"The History and Allure of Time Travel,\\" \\"The Creative Process,\\" and \\"Visual Effects.\\" There's commentary for the director's cut by co-directors and co-writers Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber. Deleted / alternate scenes and a storyboard gallery are included as well.<br /><br />If you're a fan of this particular movie or ones like it, getting \\"The Butterfly Effect: The Director's Cut\\" Blu-ray is a given. There's no better way to see it than in high-definition. Consumers will be happy thanks to a good amount of special features and the inclusion of two different quality versions of the movie.nes and a storyboard gallery are included as well.<br /><br />If you're a fan of this particular movie or ones like it, getting \\"The Butterfly Effect: The Director's Cut\\" Blu-ray is a given.

B006KX3GXO|3.0|I think that this apps is great for people who should like photography. I really enjoyed the time I spent on this apps I would have even putten this as my favorite app.
0345803485|1.0|As others have echoed numerous times before me - this book is just plain awful.  I don't even feel bad about spoiling the book because I see it as more of a service to people.  Don't waste your precious time reading this book; it is absolute drivel.<br /><br />Talk about suspension of disbelief here.  MY GOODNESS, it is so very difficult to believe that a supposedly gorgeous girl had, at the tender age of 22, never had sex, never masturbated, and never had a boyfriend before she met the other main character, Grey.  In conjunction with these facts, she gives perfect head the first time she gives it to him...and guess what else?? The girl has no gag reflex!  Incredible...  On top of that, she seems to be able to have powerful orgasms at the drop of a hat.  Some scenes are a bit vague but what I gather from them is that a few of the orgasms seem to happen without direct stimulation to the clitoris.  Seriously, this girl just says his name or he fingers her and she can come like no tomorrow.  Oh, and she has orgasms without fail just about every time any sexual activity goes on, regardless of whether it is sex, fingering, utilizing sex toys, or even better, having a wet dream (yes, she has one of her powerful orgasms while dreaming of Grey).<br /><br />And enough with the girl - Grey is just as unbelievable of a character.  He is young, is a millionaire/billionaire (I don't think it differentiates in the book between the two, but needless to say, he's super rich), is extremely hot, and can get any girl he wants, yet he is just SO fixated by this stupid, innocent, naive little girl, Ana.  Not to mention he has a pilot's license, speaks fluent French, and can play the piano like a concert pianist.<br /><br />And this is a minor detail as compared to the brief synopsis of the two main characters I gave, but there are flaws in the context of the book.  Ana is supposed to be a young adult in her 20s living in the United States but the book is rife with British colloquialisms(which I won't repeat here since other reviewers have aptly pointed out specific examples already).  If you still choose to read this book after this review, try to watch for more subtle undercurrents of the story feeling disconnected because of these cultural mismatches in the book.  Also, the whole roommate situation just doesn't feel authentic.  I just graduated from college and have had many roommates in the past, but the personalities and interactions listed in this book just didn't mesh well with what I regard as in line with reality.<br /><br />Bottom line, I've read some good erotic fiction (with great writing nonetheless!) and this is not it - this book may get a virgin's panties in a twist, but I'd pity the woman who can get off on this nonsense.  And if I could give this 0 stars, I would.
0385736002|4.0|Background: Nick Flamel is not who he says he is, not just a bookstore owner, but an immortal alchemyst. Josh and Sophie are just teenagers working their summer jobs, when they get wrapped up in the unbelievable world that surrounds Nick. Thought to be the twins of an ancient legend they begin their journey and the fight to save humanity from the evil Dr. D and the Elders.<br /><br />Review: I have been putting off reading this series and now I feel stupid that I waited so long. This first book was very good and it made me want to jump right into the next one. Sophie is very likable and put together, while her brother Josh is impatient and constantly nagging, so they play well off of one another.<br />When Sophie starts to get treated differently it becomes clear that Josh is super jealous of his twin's abilities and it is a good lead in to the next book. I think the idea of having all myths and legends based in truth for this book is great. The twins come in to contact with some crazy things, immortals, magic, beasts that have not existed in centuries, and many other things. It's a fantasy, mystery, and adventure all wrapped into one book and the story never lets you down.<br /><br />The story alternates between various groups of people, sometimes the twins with Nick, sometimes Dr.D and also Perenelle who is Nick's Wife.<br /><br />Great 1st book, almost done with book 2, also full of adventure!

B005QI4TP8|5.0|New to Florence and the Machine, and quite a convert as a result of this album. (Yes, I admit it - the season finale episode of \\"Revenge\\" with its last few minutes turned me on to this group.) Somewhere between Evanescence, Adele and Tori Amos - great music - powerful and moving, sometimes strong, sometimes subtle (what a background to clean house or exercise to)... and that voice! No lyrics in liner notes, so if you're a lyric-maniac like me, you may need to download and learn, but no regrets!
B0017SWPXY|3.0|The best thing I can say about the book is Stein does have a way of stringing words to create beautiful strands of prose. I also liked the main character, Enzo, the dog, but there was a lot in the book I didn't particularly like. I question the fact it's on the required reading list of some schools, because it is definitely an adult novel. It has some profanity and tells of things like a homosexual couple, the dog watching the intimate moments between Eve and Denny, and a fifteen-year-old who tries to seduce Denny. On top of all this, it expounds a deep belief in reincarnation. Even with all this, I didn't hate the book, because I can appreciate good writing. However, I didn't love the book, either. Taken as a whole, I couldn't give it more than three stars.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Alot of twist and stuff going on in this season , I really hope they make a season 5.AND WHY DID JAX CUT HIS HAIR?

B008FLYM50|5.0|I've been OBSESSED with Marina and the Diamonds for the past month. I started off listening to songs from her first album 'The Family Jewels'. It took me a while to get used to her quirkiness and digest her extremely unique voice, but once I did: I was hooked.<br /><br />So, I moved on to 'Electra Heart' Diamandis' second album. (For clarification Marina and the Diamonds is a SOLOIST, NOT a band; the diamonds are you and I, her fans).<br /><br />My immediate reaction was \\"Dang, she sold out.\\" She went from being a brunette to a peroxide-blonde with massive roots, she went from quirky new-wave music, to Britney Spears pop. I initially lost a lot of respect to her. But I gave 'Electra Heart' a chance.<br /><br />My thoughts on this album have changed COMPLETELY. It is REVOLUTIONARY. Seriously, I have not been obsessed with an artist like this since Florence +the Machine. This girl knows what she's doing, this 'Electra Heart' album is meant to be a COMPLETE mockery of pop culture and American society. At face-value it looks and sounds like what you'd expect from a Britney/Madonna wannabe, but once you read into the lyrics and the concepts, you'll realize you couldn't be more wrong.<br /><br />Give her a chance, every person I've introduced her to has fallen in LOVE with her. Even my metal-head friends who listen to screamo have grown fond of her, this is no Katy Perry, this is no ordinary pop. This is revolutionary, catchy, cheeky, genius to say the least. But PLEASE do yourself a favor and listen to 'The Family Jewels' as well, you'll understand this album much better, otherwise Marina will just come off as a dumb bimbo (which was 100% her intention in my opinion). The album overall can be described as Marina's 'Trojan Horse', she is clearly poking fun at the archetypes that pervade our pop culture: the Teen Idol, the Homewrecker, the Beauty Queen, the Housewife, etc. Take a listen, I promise you will love it.<br /><br />1) 'Bubblegum Bitch' 4/5<br />I cringed when I first saw the title for this track, I thought it belonged in Madonna's new album 'MDNA'. It's produced to be radio-friendly, catchy, bitchy as the title suggests. But it reveals a lot about how Marina sees young girls and the culture surrounding them. You will become obsessed after a few listens.<br /><br />2) 'Primadonna' 5/5<br />The catchiest track in the whole album, meant to be so. Produced by Dr. Luke, this tune will stay stuck in your head for WEEKS. 'Primadonna' sounds like something that Katy Perry would put out; it clearly pokes fun at the pop idols of our time with lines like: \\"Get what I want cause I ask for it, not because I'm really that deserving of it.\\" OUCH! This song is also clearly a follow up to Marina's previous hit from her first album, 'Hollywood'.<br /><br />3) 'Lies' 5/5<br />A wonderful ballad, with a dubstep inspired tune. She managed to turn a sad song, into a pop song. Some call it, the ultimate friend-zoned song. Judge for yourself: \\"You're never gonna love me, so what's the use? What's the point in playing, a game you're gonna lose?\\"<br /><br />4) 'Homewrecker' 3/5<br />One of my least favorites, only because it's the ugliest archetype in my opinion. \\"They call me homewrecker! Homewrecker! I break a million hearts just for fun, I don't belong to anyone.\\" I can already see 12 year old girls singing this and posting lyrics on FB enveloped in the vacuous lyrics without realizing Marina's genius sarcasm.<br /><br />5) 'Starring Role' 5/5<br />\\"You know I'd rather walk alone, than play a supporting role...If I can't get the starring role.\\" My favorite song in the album when it comes to lyrics, it's a wonderful and heartfelt song. Perhaps the most genuine show of Marina's ACTUAL personality and not the 'Electra Heart' character.<br /><br />6) 'The State of Dreaming' 3/5<br />\\"Millions of girls float on their one quote\\" referring to Marilyn Monroe's famous \\"If you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve to see me at my best.\\" speech. This song is one of the least appealing when it comes to sound, but one of the best when it comes to lyrics.<br /><br />7) 'Power & Control' 5/5<br />Too dark to be a radio-hit, but man is it good. My favorite line \\"Think you're funny? Think you're smart? Think you're gonna break my heart? Yeah, you may be good looking but you're not a piece of art.\\" Watch the video, it's great. Definitely my favorite out of the entire album.<br /><br />8) 'Sex Yeah' 5/5<br />Again, this is one of the songs that initially turned me off along with 'Bubblegum Bitch'. Once I listened to the lyrics (these require a lot less interpretation than the others) it was clear that this monster of a song was not to be compared to the common pop of Katy Perry and Nicki Minaj. \\"If women were religiously recognized sexually, we wouldn't have to feel the need, to show our ass-ets to feel free.\\"<br /><br />9) 'Teen Idle' 5/5<br />Any outsider will be able to relate to this one \\"Wish I'd been a prom queen fighting for the title, instead of being sixteen and burning up a Bible.\\" A wonderfully produced tune with great lyrics.<br /><br />10) 'Valley of the Dolls' 4/5<br />Perhaps the saddest song on this album, this song explores the price of fame in modern society. \\"In the valley of the dolls we sleep, got a hole inside of me, living with identities, that do not belong to me.\\" Social commentary on the production of pop stars, who are really nothing but puppets of the labels. It's refreshing to hear a POP star singing about it.<br /><br />11) 'Hypocrates' 1/5<br />A track that in my opinion could have been omitted from the track list without having a major impact on the rest of the album. It carries essentially the same message as 'Lies' and 'Starring Role'. \\"I know you only want to own me, and that's the kind of love you show me.\\"<br /><br />12) 'How to be a Heartbreaker' 4/5<br />Marina's attempt at breaking through the U.S. market and climb the charts. \\"Rule number one, is that you gotta have fun, but baby when you're done you gotta be the first to run.\\" It sounds like pop, it is pop, not the most mind-opening song on the album. It's catchy, but reveals almost nothing. More of a filler meant to make Marina more famous. Produced by Dr. Luke, expect to hear this on the radio very soon.<br /><br />13) 'Radioactive' 4/5<br />Strangely reminiscent of Rihanna's \\"We Found Love\\", 'Radioactive' was actually produced and RELEASED before the latter. One of the poppiest songs on the album, it's a good listen. Not her best. \\"In the night your heart is full and by the morning empty. But baby I'm the one who left you, you're not the one who left me.\\"<br /><br />14) 'Fear and Loathing' 4/5<br />This song was the first tune to have a video released for it on YouTube, yet it's the last song on the album's tracklist. Huh? It seems like the 'Fear and Loathing' is Marina's true concern for becoming vacuous and shallow like the character she champions through 'Electra Heart'. \\"I've lived a lot of different lives, been different people many times, I've lived my life in bitterness and filled my heart with emptiness.\\" This song is the death of the character 'Electra Heart', her redemption and her fall. Back to the old Marina please!<br /><br />15) 'Buy the Stars' 5/5 [NOT IN U.S. RELEASE]<br />BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL song that is unfortunately not included on the U.S. release, look it up on YouTube. A fine ballad with great raw emotion. Some people say she's talking about the Illuminati's influence on today's pop music, who knows! \\"You bought a star in the sky tonight, because your life is dark, and it needs some light, you named it after me but I'm not yours to keep. Because, you'll never see, that the stars are free.\\"<br /><br />16) 'Lonely Hearts Club' 5/5 [NOT IN U.S. RELEASE]<br />A throwback to 'The Family Jewels' era, this song incorporates quirky beats and sounds that make it one of the least mainstream-sounding songs on the album. One of my favorites. \\"Love will never be forever, feelings are just like the weather. January to December, do you wanna be a member?\\"<br /><br />17) 'Living Dead' 4/5 [NOT IN U.S. RELEASE]<br />This is another non-essential track in the album, so I see why Diamandis decided to not release it to the U.S. crowd and replace it with 'How to be a Heartbreaker'. Though non-essential, it's a shame that U.S. fans won't get this tune on this release. It sounds great, lyrics are ok. \\"I haven't lived life, I haven't lived love, just protect me from the sky above. I lay back in a glittering mist, and I, I think of all the men I could've kissed.\\"tta have fun, but baby when you're done you gotta be the first to run.\\" It sounds like pop, it is pop, not the most mind-opening song on the album. It's catchy, but reveals almost nothing. More of a filler meant to make Marina more famous. Produced by Dr. Luke, expect to hear this on the radio very soon.<br /><br />13) 'Radioactive' 4/5<br />Strangely reminiscent of Rihanna's \\"We Found Love\\", 'Radioactive' was actually produced and RELEASED before the latter.

0525952616|1.0|Let me start by saying I loved his two first books and preordered this one. Now, I would seriously like my money back. The first half of the book dragged and the writing was awful. It was like a white paper set to music. At about two thirds of the way through, there is a breakthrough of sorts. With that info, I thought of about a dozen different ways to resolve the core issue (trying not to spoil). AND THEN they force romance. Ri-DIC-U-LOUS. Pathetic. At about 3/4 of the way through, a colleague of mine and I were debating whether to finish it at all. I did, and wish now that I had saved my time.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|This would be an excellent app if you had the ability to store your downloaded music on the external SD card.  Currently the only option is to store data to the internal phone SD card and not the external SD card.
B0011Z78R6|5.0|Less than a half-dozen songs/albums from the 1970's could be truly characterized as bona fide music masterpieces, taking listeners beyond the typical and leaving the mundane and the cliche behind. \\"American Pie\\" by Don McClean and \\"Barracuda\\" by Heart are two which make it on the list. Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" is another. And \\"Hotel California\\", both the title and the album may be the only other. I don't know if I can muster more titles from a decade which saw the rise of idiotic disco music and forever lowered everyone's standards. While most people were dancing to brainless and generic synthesizer music in the late 1970's while wearing open-collared polyester suits, much like today, a few truly dedicated artists were creating music to challenge the listener.<br /><br />The song \\"Hotel California\\", probably the best and most memorable song by the Eagles, has so many levels of meaning and interpretation, it can't be pigeon-holed into being labeled this or that. The singer tells a strange story about when he was driving one night down the \\"dark desert highway\\", either along Highway 5 between San Francisco and Los Angeles, or the other similar highway between Los Angeles and Las Vegas on Highway 15. Although the cover is the Beverly Hills Hotel in the Los Angeles area, the song describes a California-Spanish style hotel, one of which resides in a small truck-stop town about 100 miles southeast of San Francisco. Wherever the song takes place, it's in the Middle of Nowhere, California. Tired from his journey, the storyteller decides to stay at a very strange hotel where there appear to be no lights. He hears the ringing of a bell, like a church. A woman appears at the doorway and leads him in via the light of a candle. There are people whispering and dancing in an open courtyard, some \\"dance to remember\\" while others \\"dance to forget\\". The woman seems like she has some hold over them who appear to be mostly males. At one point he orders wine, and in the most famous line from the song, the \\"Captain\\" says they haven't had the \\"spirit\\" here since 1969.

Many interpretations of the song have been offered by different people, and the Eagles are reluctant to spell it out what it all means, which is the true mark of a great piece of musical literature.

B0088RQ4X4|5.0|I read all the John Carter Novels when I was a kid in the 1950's. I purchased and reread them again prior to seeing this film. I absolutely hate it when the film changes anything important from the book. This film is a major exception. KUDOS TO THE FILM WRITERS! Elements from the 2nd novel Gods Of Mars were intertwined with the original 1st book Princess of Mars to create a strong bridge with a much more mavolent evil group to fight: the Thanes.  Edgar Rice Burroughs would approve, as do I.  Great action, aliens, daredoing and fighting for the damsel in distress.  Also damsel is beautiful and BRAINEY. She is not helpless but does need a helping hand from John Carter.  The movie is great. I am hoping for the 2 sequel movies.<br /><br />The advertising for this movie was horrible.  The books have not been easily avalible for years an there is little recognition by the younger generations who would most enjoy scifi/fantasy.  So what do I see but hazey red posters with a vague figure of a man and the name JOHN CARTER blazened across.  No John Carter of Mars which might give a clue but a name that does not have the recognition value of TARZAN. Disney wait a while and get some decent advertising and try the theatres again.  Also PLEASE do the sequels.

0439813786|5.0|My nine year-old daughter read this book. Here is the review we wrote from her point of view:<br /><br />1931, Paris, France. Hugo Cabret was living in an apartment with his dad. One day, Hugo's dad finds an automaton (a doll that is built to do unique, person like acts), and tries to fix it, but it causes a fire and Hugo never saw his dad again. Now that Hugo lives by himself, his Uncle Claude came in as his only living relative, and took him away from his school and brought him to live with him in a secret room at the train station. Uncle Claude taught Hugo how to survive by stealing food and supplies. One night, Uncle Claude went out and never returned. Hugo tries to fix the automaton and has to get a key for it to work.  But soon, Hugo finds himself in trouble by stealing both food and supplies.<br /><br />I like the book because it's a mystery and an adventure combined. It's interesting and unique also filled with amazing illustrations with loads of details. The author is also the illustrator which I think is interesting. When I first looked at this book, I thought it would take me a long time to read, but I finished in three days, three days of reading an amazing book.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I got this as a FAOTD, which might skew my review a little on the positive side, but overall I am very pleased with this game. I play this game on both my EVO and my Asus Transformer. Both handle the game well. The EVO is a little tough with the small screen and need for very specific finger placement, but my like for the game overcame that.<br />The price seems a little steep for a very simple platform, and if I did not get it for free I would knock down a star for that.

B000VWGYEI|5.0|Those who reviewed this before me referred to this as Elton's first album. Actually, it's not, it's his second. It's a common mistake, though, because this was the first album he released in the US. He released Empty Sky in the UK in 1969, a year before this was released in the US. Empty Sky didn't make it to the US for a couple of more years, so a lot of folks my age think this is his first album since that's the order we heard them in. Anyway, I really love this album. It is more introspective and more complex, both in music and in lyrics, than Empty Sky. These are still some of his best songs, even after all these years. Any Elton John fan who has been limited to his greatest hits type of albums should definitely check this one out. There are real gems here that you won't find on the compilations. In particular, don't miss Sixty Years On or First Episode at Hienton.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|In book one we are introduced to House Stark and, as with most fantasy books, I thought they were the good guys and good guys win. Case in point, Paul of House Atreides in Dune.  Not so with this author.  I like a more concise vision of story telling where the plot advances and the ancillary characters have some point in being a part of the whole. This author has thrown so many characters and sub-plots into the mix that it's hard to keep them all in mind with the few times they give their points of view. With five books read, I cannot imagine the author completing a satisfying ending to all the plot lines in five more books.  While I would love to see where this story ends, I'm not sure I want to wait several years for the next book, and the next book more years after. Congratulations to all who have been with the story since it's inception and waited the many years for A Dance with Dragons.  I don't have enough of an emotional investment in the remaining characters and probably don't have that kind of patience.
B0061Q13V2|4.0|I very rarely read biographies.  In fact I can think of only one other one I've read (that wasn't a school assignment).  I love watching gymnastics and saw this book so I got a sample sent to my Kindle.<br /><br />One person's review said they weren't sure of why she started with the chapter about her sister.  I personally think it was a brilliant move.  It draws you in and laid the ground work for describing who her parents were as people in the next chapter.<br /><br />I was appalled by many of the things mentioned in the book about the world of gymnastics but I can't say that I'm surprised.  Another review I read on here alluded that \\"official\\" book reviews/media sources were stating that \\"she can't back it up\\" or that \\"she was bitter.\\"  To this I would say that I remember hearing mumblings (I think it was after the 96 Olympics) about how \\"not nice\\" Bela Karolyi was.<br /><br />I think that because it is shocking and appalling because people don't WANT to believe it.  People most likely think that: Surely in this day and age this couldn't be taking place in a place like the US.<br /><br />For me it doesn't take a stretch of the imagination to believe.  When I was telling my mother about the book her first comment was: \\"Sounds very European to me.\\"(Meaning reminiscent of the Soviet Union methods in years past).  To illustrate I have two words: Elena Mukhina.  A Soviet Woman gymnast that was pushed to do a tumbling pass that was beyond her capabilities and strength, as well as beyond her comfort.  The result was that she broke her neck.  Granted, she was a Soviet Woman and the Karoylis are Romanian but both places were communists countries at their height and, as such, had very similar views on their athletes.  (Ironically the reason she was pushed to do this was because of entrance of one  Nadia Comneci to the gymnastic forum.  And who was  Nadia Comneci's coach?  Bela Karolyi.)<br /><br />Bottom line is that it really what naysayers think.  It is not so unreasonable to put legislation in to place to protect our youthful athletes.  We protect our child stars: How many hours they can work, laws about their getting schooling, etc.  California also has the Coogan law to help protect some of the earnings of child actors.  Something like this should be considered for child athletes as well.<br /><br />I do agree with the one reviewer that the writing was a little dry in a few spots and not necessarily written with a skill that one would expect of a published book but I found these things easy to overlook because the story is so enthralling.  Don't get me wrong, this book is NOT poorly written.  It's hard for me to articulate exactly what I mean.  The best I can do is say I have read a lot of books, mostly fiction, (I own about 10,000 books) and it doesn't quite have the polish that a professional writer would have. But you know going in that writing is not her profession so I found it easy to overlook.  In my opinion, you wouldn't expect an author to do a cartwheel with the polish and grace of a gymnast; you can't expect a gymnast to have the polish of a professional author.<br /><br />Another person complained about how she goes on and on about her \\"perfect husband.\\"  I didn't find it that bad.  Yes, to some degree I could agree with that reviewer but I found it more sweet.  To me it was like she was trying to convey to the readers all her overwhelming love and admiration for this man into words and no words seemed adequate so she just kept adding more words.<br /><br />Overall, it something everyone should read and hopefully some laws can be enacted to help protect all our young athletes.
1451627297|5.0|Vintage King... and that's as good as it gets. Not difficult to buy into the  time travel premise which sets the stage for all types of Butterfly effect possibilities. However, this is merely a back drop to one of the most wonderful and heart warming love stories you will ever read...and certainly not predicted or anticipated by the title. The ending is both satisfying and memorable and will linger in your heart far beyond the historical account of a sad time not so long ago.

B0036IAYLS|5.0|Even on first viewing I really liked this film. I loved the acting and the style but somehow I felt a certain emotional distance keeping me from labeling it great.<br /><br />But on second viewing, I found myself far more deeply moved, while still being intellectually challenged by the moral, emotional and ethical complexity of the story of a brilliant quadriplegic man with much to give the world wanting to die. Bardem gives a truly heartbreaking, world class performance, and is closely matched by those around him. Director Amenabar also wrote the score for his own film and it is terrific and original. Throughout, there were stylish touches that gave me a visceral shiver. A few simplistic scenes, and slower moments keep me from calling it a perfect film, but it's not far off.

0345803485|1.0|Every once in a great while, (Thank God), a story with a either a ridiculous plot line, or consisting  of some form of erotic fetish or taboo, somehow makes its way into main stream reading, and unfortunately sometimes even onto the best seller list.  It's particularly bad when it happens to take the form of a relationship or \\"romance\\" that most women would ordinarily find severely degrading, dangerous, and above all beneath them.  But that is just exactly what has happened in the wake of this ghastly terrible novel.  In the interest of being cool or whatever it may be, far too many women that I would have ever guessed have just set adrift the boundaries of their pride and intelligence and succumb to all the hype and degradation.  Fifty Shades not only rises to the occasion of being horribly written, insulting and stupid, but just may be the worst book I have ever seen.  Ever since its release I have been relentlessly amazed at the site and sounds of so many seemingly intelligent and well adjusted women, that have just sprouted the true colors of falling for nothing but cheap stupid Mommy Porn.  The more I listen to all the giggling and slobbering about it, the more I cannot help but feel that so many of them simply must be secretly very unhappy, nurturing a feeling of greatly lacking something in their lives, or just long ago gave it all up and have taken to running away with ridiculous fantasy romances like this and Twilight.  (Just for the record, and in for the sake of fairness, Twilight is worlds ahead of this piece of crap in both its literary makeup, and substance.  What does that tell ya?) This book is not just the obvious insult to women of good taste and nurturing love lives, but is also terribly insulting to all men who have always lived under the pretense that the way to capture a fair ladies heart is through honesty, integrity, and above all respecting their intelligence and values.  This book quite simply put, craps all over the old fashioned honor and respect of real courtship, and truly taking the time to allow true love to spawn, and hopefully flourish.  I couldn't help but wonder as I tried to make it through this thing what possibly will be next if something like this can make certain woman act so foolish, and so carelessly toss way their common sense.  A new best seller about mother and son incest that titillates?  How about a serial killer that relentlessly tortures his victim only to see an undying love unfold... This book has opened the flood gates of a whole new direction....All downward...<br /><br /> I could go on and on believe me.  One thing that is good about this book is it is relentless inspiration for describing something rotten in great detail.  Suffice it to say I just don't get it ladies.  When I read the glowing reviews of this thing I cannot help but be left with wondering:  How is it that we men have come to be known down through the centuries as being......So easy?....I'm sorry if I offend anyone with this review. But I am offended by this book. I happen to be a gentleman.  And I come from a long line of gentlemen.  And this book just has be wondering now... Why bother?<br /><br />Avoid....Avoid this book like others run away and hate war, disease, and pestilence.  If this book is your idea of love, fulfillment, and drawing a welling tear, trust me...

B008KRJWEK|1.0|The main problem is the money the game barely gives any money at all so that glue forces you to get them real money for in -game money and the first car you get is absolute crape and when you get power ups they are useless your first car can barely do what any regular car from the 90's could do and this supposed to happen sometime around now so if this reaches glue you better fix this and not demand my money because this is the most crape you have ever given me and I am still a customer after the fail of eternity warriors and also deer hunter is crape with aiming why did you make it so that your hunter is always looking towards the ground also the models for the hunters are crape too just let us make our own hunter because you can't make a decent looking one at all!

People spending this much money should have the real deal<br /><br />Here's a CRAZY IDEA - with a zillion discs in these 'deluxe' editions, WHY NOT HAVE THE MAIN ALBUM PRESENTED WITH PROPERLY NORMALIZED AUDIO AND ANOTHER WITH THE LOUD VERSION - People might actually learn the difference.<br /><br />PS: In general, you're better with a properly mastered CD and turning up the volume yourself
B0089IGUP4|2.0|This record's release came as a pleasant surprise, as I heard no preliminary press about it coming out.  That being said, it is  a disappointment, much of which must be laid at the feet of the production, and what clearly appears to be an attempt to fit this band into a particular format for commercial radio programmers.  The sound, particularly on the first 3 songs, has been smoothed out, as has the singing.  In addition, the lyrics miss the specificity of their other albums, and much of the album seems \\"controlled\\", instead of the passion they brought to bear on their other works.  The songs , and the passion, improve after the first three, rather generic,  numbers, but the sound stays polite.  I can only hope that they will be left alone on their next set, or, they return to an indie label.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a great and awesome game to play once you start plying you wont get enough so get it

It allows you to make your own music to which you feel relaxed and it would be great if they could offer this as a computer program so that you could listen to it there as well. Just listening to this makes me feel relaxed and more at ease when I am needed just a little bit of a meditative state to help and focus through a situation. Highly recommend:)

I highly recommend for those interested though to pick up the Audio book read by Will Weaton, it's so awesome. If you were a video game fan as a kid (or still are now) buy this book (and listen to the audio book). You won't regret it.
B008C20TDG|5.0|I've read a few Paleo/Primal books and I've loved them, but It Starts with Food offers a whole new perspective on the Paleo way of eating. The authors avoid the anthropologic approach, and simply divide foods into two categories: foods that make you MORE healthy, or LESS healthy. It can't get any simpler. ISWT also excels at simplifying all the \\"science-y\\" stuff, letting the reader at least begin to comprehend how certain foods affect our body, in turn making us capable of making our own nutrition decisions. The 30-day program is also a fantastic way to cleanse the body, create new habits, and just let yourself know whether this stuff works or not.<br /><br />Since I read it, it has been my first recommendation to people interested in Paleo or nutrition. It is simple, entertaining, engaging, and concise.
0439023513|2.0|First of all, ***SPOILER ALERT!!!<br /><br />The only reason I gave this book two stars rather than one is because the ending and epilogue were decent. The rest of the book, not so much. The whole thing was a giant spiral of depression, the worst part being that Collins killed off the one character that the protagonist wrapped her entire life around, the one that sparked all of the craziness of the series... Prim! At that point, I was done with this book. Besides that, pretty much everyone dies, Katniss and Peeta are mutilated and never return to their old physical conditions, which is insane because they're 17. And the ties between Katniss and every character left besides Peeta are forever severed. Gale, out. Her mother, out.... Yes, the government has improved but the way it got to that point was just horrible and sloppy on Collins' part. This could have been done so much better. So sad.

I give it 10 stars!:)
B007549W62|3.0|The first half hour of the movie was pretty boring to watch. It got more interesting once the survivors started turning on each other. But towards the end of the movie, the characters just randomly go insane. I get that they were slowly descending into madness, but they all seem to go completely crazy in an instant. Suddenly, they're protecting their enemies and killing their friends for no discernible reason whatsoever. I would have rated the movie higher if the characters' actions towards the end of the movie made any sense whatsoever. Still, the middle bloc of the movie is entertaining to watch. It's worth a rental, but I wouldn't buy it. I don't regret watching it, but it's not the kind of thing I'd bother watching more than once.
B00834R580|5.0|I am not sure how I stumbled on this show but once I watched one episode, I had to watch all the episodes.  I am hooked!  It is smart, amusing, witty, well-acted.  Love it!  Watch it and I promise you won't be sorry about the time spent!  I can hardly wait for new episodes in 2013.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I down loaded this book from Amazon.com to my Kindle Fire. The Author Gillian Flynn did a good job writing this e-book. The style of writing with the introduction of the main characters diary worked and drew me into the e-book even more. The e-book reads very well and you will glide across the pages, which is conformation that is it well written. The story is also well structured moving from each character into their scenes. The plot and pace of the e-book picked up and made me want to turn the page. The story should connect with a wide audience because it has the theme of a bad marriage throughout the e-book. How people will go to great lengths to bring pain and suffering to someone they married is pretty common and strange at the same time. There were large spaces in between words throughout the e-book, and that was very distracting. This version of the e-book needs a little work or the author should look into the formatting issue, if they want to put out a good quality e-book. Overall the e-book is a good read but the e-version lowered the bar in quality and stopped me from feeling like I got my money's worth. I could not help but feel a little cheated. I paid top dollar price for the e-book but did not get the same back in this e-book. I have and would recommend this e-book to a friend.
B001VLXNLU|2.0|I read these books and absolutely love them. Zoey can be annoying but she's sixteen so I let it go. The storyline is great and progresses nicely. HOWEVER! I just started reading the black dagger brotherhood books and noticed quite a few similarities including zoeys catchphrase\\"ah hell\\". BDB definitely came out before these and it was kind of dissapointing to see P.C. Cast got a lot of her ideas from these books.  The vampires have tattoos, some can withstand sunlight, and they're not born vampires. They go through a transition when they're 25. They have a deity called the scribe virgin (Nyx) and a human male who manages to group together with the vampires (Heath). There is also a character who just happens to be called Z. I understand taking inspiration from another book you love, but she straight up used the same ideas. Before, I would've given these books five stars, but I'm so dissapointing in the author it gets two.

B00006AW2M|1.0|I'd like some of what the 5-star reviewers are smoking.  I love the Stones so much, and can't imagine why they would allow such a cacophonous, drug-fueled, me-too attempt at psychedelia to see the light of day.  Oh yeah, that's right, they were all stoned (no pun intended) off their arses!<br /><br />The band members themselves label this album as absolute garbage!  The production values are off-the-chart horrible.  This was the band's only self-produced album (and it shows), and the world thanks their lucky stars for that to this day.  Praise of this album by anyone should be punishable by public stoning (oh God, unintentional pun again).
0062124293|5.0|I love this book. It goes from the hilarious to the most serious parts of a woman's life, from the ridiculousness of trying to walk in high heels to the agony of childbirth.<br /><br />This book is not for everyone. If you are easily offended, avoid this book, as there is a lot of cursing and some sex. If you are looking for a women's studies book, this is not for you either, as this is not a politically correct book about women or anything else.<br /><br />The only real problem is that some of the slang and pop references are very British, so I had no clue what or who was being to referred to.
B007UQ5Z1G|3.0|As a die hard Linkin Park fan, I rushed to buy this CD when it was released.  I've listed to it a few times now....and although I like it, I don't 'love' it as much as all my other Linkin Park collections.  Chester sounding very 'mellow' in this effort, which isn't necessarity a bad thing.  It's just not what I was expecting.  Getting ready to see the band live next week, and I'm sure they will kill it.  If I had to buy this CD over again, I probably wouldn't.  But I love my other 4 CD's, even a Thousand Suns, which some fans criticized.  Still think that are the best!
0811879542|5.0|This is a book that was an Amazon recommendation and I could not be happier about my purchase.  My almost 4 year old son loves this book.  He loves to shake the book, blow on the dots, make the dots bigger etc.  Very interactive and still a favorite after being read dozens of times.

B008KP6ENE|5.0|Ok so here is basically what paper monsters is:<br /><br />1. take the HD graphics of little planet<br />2. add concepts of various platformers (mario bros. donkey kong, little big planet etc.)<br />3. add hidden areas to explore, outfits to buy, additional modes to unlock<br /><br />and you get paper monsters.<br /><br />But that is the simple way of putting it.<br /><br />Paper monsters is basically the perfect child of say nintendo + Media Molecule.<br /><br />the gameplay is simple; move with a virtual stick(or switch to classic pad) and press the right side of the screen to jump. You go through various levels and collect grey buttons, the hard to find gold buttons and the 3 golden paper clips. (Gold buttons are used to purchase new outfits for your little hero)<br /><br />but the gameplay is not just simply that. At the end of each world you will have to face the boss in creative ways (one boss you fight is underwater so you are turned into a submarine with torpedoes to shoot at the boss) and with little things such as revolving platforms, crumbling platforms bomb-able blocks and hidden ares to find more gold buttons and such. Paper monsters adds a lot of variety.<br /><br />So all in all this is the platform for a portable that I have been looking for. A Game that actually wants to be considered console quality in the eyes of gamers everywhere.<br /><br />if more mobile games were this good, I'd probably become an Android/ios only gamer.<br /><br />5/5<br />played on: Samsung Galaxy player 5.0
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I'm a big Kindle fan and used to love being able to continue reading a book on my phone right where I left off on my Kindle. Not any more!<br /><br />I recently downloaded Kindle for Droid version 3.6.0.87, which performs HORRIBLY! It freezes up at every screen. When give a choice between Force Close and Wait, selecting Wait will eventually work, progressing (after 30 seconds or more) to the next screen, where it freezes up again. And again. And again...<br /><br />It just took 20 minutes to open a book! It also won't sync to download new items. Needless to say, I will be uninstalling this turkey.<br /><br />I have a Droid 2.3; Droid 2.0 is supposed to be the minimum for this version of Kindle for Droid.<br /><br />A user suggestion to re-install from the Amazon AppStore did not work for me. (I downloaded the AppStore successfully, downloaded and installed Kindle for Droid version 3.6.0.87 (which took significantly longer than doing it via Droid Play Store. Opened the Kindle app and had the same problem: freeze and force close...)<br /><br />I'm now looking for older versions of Kindle for Droid on freeware sites.
0345803485|5.0|I heard about this book and I was curious so I ordered it I read it twice. I am now addicted and I am waiting impatiently for the third book to arrive . The details are realistic and I think thats what makes it addicting.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Reacher receives an unusual distress call from one of his old unit members.  One of his group is dead and three are missing.  The remaining crew assemble in search of vengeance.<br /><br />The Reacher series simply doesn't get much better than BAD LUCK.  It's great to see Reacher in command, even if it's a bit like the blind leading the blind for a time.  They're a quirky and entertaining bunch.<br /><br />Child quickly raises the stakes as it becomes clear that there's a cabal of criminals and terrorists intent on stealing state-of-the-art military hardware.<br /><br />The pages fly by a mile-a-minute and the ending pays off--in spades.
0316098329|4.0|In all honesty I wasn't sure I was going to read this book.  It seemed just to awful.  The whole idea that a young girl was kidnapped and had a baby by her kidnapper/rapist and how they lived their lives in the room.<br /><br />I am still not sure how I feel about this.  It's not a great book that everybody just has to read, but it is something.  The writer has a great writing style and her insight into how a kid thinks is amazing.  I am torn between really liking it and still feeling a little squeamish about if I could love the child of my rapist.<br /><br />It really just is a story of what a mother wouldn't do to protect her child.  She loves this kid and he adores her.  They are all they have in their very small world and their bond is felt immediately by the reader.<br /><br />Jack, the boy in question is bright and funny and insightful.  You cannot help but like this kid.  There are many twists and turns to their story, but the ending is pretty satisfying.  While it doesn't give us the happily ever after we want after their ordeal, it gives us the hope for it.

0393327345|3.0|I'm a fan of Palahniuk, but I hadn't heard of him until well after I'd seen Fight Club a bunch of times.  Truth be told, I prefer the movie, strangely.  The Marla character was much more fleshed out (thanks to Helena Bonham Carter), and although there were some cuts for filmmaking reasons, I thought the film stayed incredibly close to the book and its ideas.  If I were going to recommend one of his books, this wouldn't be the one, especially since everyone's seen the movie.
B0086DBE62|4.0|\\"Mirror Mirror\\" is a movie that is a cute rendition of the classic fairytale. But what is admirable is that the movie isn't trying to be anything else other than a nice and sweet story. The tone and pace are set perfectly for this kind of rendition. The actors also fit very well into their roles.<br />Julia Roberts is obviously having fun being the conceited queen and has some fun scenes. One could even argue she has the better female role. Lily Collins does very well holding her own but at times seems a bit nervous and uncomfortable but this being her first starring role she clearly shows she has room to grow. Armie Hammer plays his fumbling prince charming without missing a step and sweeps Snow White off her feet.<br />But the best part in my opinion are the dwarves. They each have a whimsical personality that sets them apart and are the most entertaining characters in the film. Nathan Lane, Sean Bean and Mare Winningham do well with what they've got but it would have been nice to see more of them. What stands out most are the lush visuals that are not shy of using vibrant colors and the costumes are quite alluring visually.<br />In short, if cute and campy isn't your kind of humor than maybe wait for \\"Snow White and The Hunstman\\" for a different take on the story. But if you don't mind a silly good time and some very nicely designed eye candy then enjoy this movie with an open mind.

0307120007|3.0|This is an adorable book, but I don't see it lasting long once an infant gets a hold of it!  It's rather flimsy and made of thin cardboard.  Too bad they didn't make it of higher quality and to last!
B0063IH60K|3.0|Too many ads without a consistent way to shut them off. Product sluggish on the Kindle. Like the tap-it-to-move feature. Okay (since it's free)
B0050VFRVG|2.0|I enjoyed this book, but it truly is a kid's book, at least this first one.  It doesn't follow the Harry Potter series in its appeal to adults and kids, I would guess.  But it would be an excellent book for your middle schooler to read.

B005HSL626|5.0|People, the app is great! Don't be cheap about it. They have to make money somehow, and they do it by putting ads in the free version. 99 cent version is for the lazies who gave one star because they can't just tap &quot;Not now.&quot;  Very fun app :)
0345802934|5.0|I've read and enjoyed everything Murakami has published and this was my favorite so far.  I can understand why some criticize it as being boring or repetitious, but to me all of that repetition was like watching rain drops make trails down a window pane - beautiful and zen-like.  I think anyone who isn't cynical by nature will find this book pleasurable.<br /><br />This is a book I will cherish for the rest of my life, and will read many more times.
0385751532|4.0|An excellent book I'd definitely want my sons to read when they get older.  Novel view into the holocaust from an innocent German child.  I listened to it on CD, and the reading was phenomenal.  The reader was an adult but caught the humor and innocence of the child's perspective perfectly.  I saw the film as well, and it loses so much without the mindset and thought of Bruno.  In case you're thinking of renting:  The film added some information that was interesting historically (like the promotional film about the camps), but overall, it could not capture the viewpoint without at least a voice-over.  It was a beautifully rendered film, and Bruno's mother was fabulously portrayed, adding a depth to the film not focused on in the novel. The ending was made much more dramatic, which made the story more unrealistic to me.  Of course visual adaptation can more readily depict the brutality (which was kept minimal but still required in a film based on the subject matter), but the shock of the story could not match the novel itself.
B00881VLCE|5.0|only problem is that it gets locked up from time to time. I love the puzzles.  good selection of free ones.  needs software update to fix the unexpected errors.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Having seen this in 3D Theater, I finally got to watch in on our 65\\" inch 3D TV and still took my breath away! Being able to smoke in your own home makes a world of difference! I actually enjoyed the movie even more!! As usual, I purchased this #D DVD/BD<br />from Amazon.com-This is where I've purchased 99% of our collection of (+- 800 DVD's & BD's, over the past 3-4 years-which averages to around (+- 200 movies a year). This is a great amount of business that I've given to Amazon.com and I've never yet received a coupon/bonus or anything else from Amazon! Not even a discount on purchasing additional movies/DVDs et al. I'm really surprised and disenchanted with Amazon due to this issue!
B00122EX4Y|5.0|I've always been a fan of Mark Knopfler and Dire Straits. I purchased this album on a whim after listening to the short preview clips. I'm very happy I did! These two singers sound incredible together and Mark Knopfler's guitar I could listen to all day long! Songs are very well written. I highly recommend.
0316056863|3.0|Worth the read. I wouldn't call Tina a novelist, but I'm guessing she wouldn't either. I also wonder if having to write short scenes and sketches has made her sort of used to writing longer chapters, since most of them were brief. Conversational and hilarious in the Tina Fey way, making you want to be friends with her just so you can hear the stories in person.

159514188X|3.0|This is clearly one of those books that is actually written for younger readers, the same way that the Percy Jackson books are written for younger readers.  (In contrast to books like Harry Potter, which are written with all levels of readers in mind).  The connections in parts of the book are somewhat tenuous, and it's definitely written in an elementary style.  That said, I think it would be a great book for use in the classroom or for a parent to recommend to his/her young reader (6th grade? somewhere around then).  It might open young students' minds about how little things that they do or say can affect others around them in ways they never anticipated.  I definitely wouldn't recommend it to my adult reader friends, but I've recommended it to my friends who have children and are teachers of young students.  I also recommend to them the audiobook, which is read by two different readers and makes the book a little more dramatic.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|I am in love with this show! Our world being a prison and the thought of shouldn't there be more are elegantly played out in a fun and exciting tale. I love the characters and adaptations of the fairy tales! It is not for everyone, it is going to be over the top and the essential good wins story. I found the story lines intriguing and inspiring in just about every episode. I think it is one of the best new shows in a long time and am glad we are getting a season 2. I would recommend to anyone to at least give it a try.
B001NFTZPM|5.0|it say it was new so i expected to be all new but the box did not look knew but i didn't care about that so much but i will liked it say that in the description but the mask and the 3 discs were new.<br /> but fast shipping
B005J4TLQG|5.0|The movie works on two levels. First of all, it allows those of us who do not live in modern urban London to see a different and sometimes shocking culture of child-thugs. It's also a big scary monster movie.<br /><br />It's all the fun of running away from monsters, figuring out how to fight back, and some great creature designs.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this one.
0060899220|4.0|I think if I wasn't familiar with Anthony Bourdain from television his style would turn me off.  Since I've seen him outside of the context of this book, it seems more wry and less smarmy than it might otherwise.  I'll read another one by him, for sure.
B000SSPL2Q|5.0|(REVISED REVIEW)<br /><br />I have had this before numerous other sets of the symphonies. Listening to it now, it still stands out well. Allmusic did not like it particularly, and the 4th may be a little weak. But it covers tone poems and other works very well. The Lemmink&auml;inen suite is very well done.<br /><br />J&auml;rvi recorded these for BIS as well, but at least the symphonies are very similar, same orchestra. They may be 10 years apart. For the serious Sibelian, I recommend the BIS versions of the Symphonies as single discs, as then you get the other works as well, tone poems and suites, with booklets. The BIS box is only worth getting for a good price, as it has the Kullervo as well.<br /><br />The least known work here is the King Christian suite, the rest are all \\"hits.\\"<br /><br />But don't stop here. I suggest one of the Finns. The Berglund EMI set from Bournemouth is a good deal right now and a V&auml;nsk&auml; mp3 download covers the same works.

B006LSZECO|2.0|I am glad I got the Kindle edition instead of spending the money for a hardback. This book immediately grabbed my attention and kept kept it for most of the book. However, as I reflect back on it, I am not sure why I continued reading it. The characters were not likable, the plot was interesting but not really believable and the ending was horrible. Before I got to the end, I considered reading her other books; I have decided that I will not.

B0089LT8Y6|5.0|Ever since Alex Skolnick rejoined the band with TFOD, Testament has recaptured their earlier melodic sound. This album is no exception. I have been listening to it for 4 days now and I can definitely say without reservation, it is one of their finest. Whoever reads this review, stop right now and download or buy the CD NOW. It really is that good. Old school? Whatever you want to call it, it's incredible. Alex Skolnick really stands out on this album more so than any album he has been on. And what else can you say about Chuck Billy? This guy's voice gets BETTER with age! How is that even possible? Go out and buy this immediately, you will not be disappointed. I'm 43 and bought \\"The Legacy\\" back in 1987 and here we are 25 years later and these guys are still going stronger than ever...

B00479SVBU|2.0|I purchased the player to have the ability to use it as a usb player. It has some great features and by far seems better then any FM transmitter that I have used. I mostly use the AUX out on my player to connect to my AUX in on my car stereo. Within 1 Month the back light went dim and now is virtually inoperable. Of course the warranty is the greatest issue. 30 Days. I will attempt to repair the Backlight my self, but its obvious that they knew it would have problems.
B001641ZFS|5.0|I see that there are some Carmignola-Abbado bashers here, and I welcome them: a true democracy needs its dissenting voices. Also, I understand very well how Carmingola-Abbado's streamlined Mozart could shock listeners grown on more traditional approaches, and unable to open their ears and mind to different views. Take the \\"Andante\\" of Sinfonia Concertante. If your expectation of what it should sound like is, say, the 11:51 minutes of Oistrakh in his 1972 recording ([[ASIN:B00000DOJD Mozart: Sinfonia Concertante, KV 364 in E Flat Major, Concertone KV 190 in C Major, Adagio KV 261, Rondo KV 269]]), then no wonder you will be shocked by Carmingola-Abbado's 9 minutes and find that the music is \\"miniaturised\\" - and not just in duration. And I can very well understand how someone accustomed to more orchestral beef and grandeur in the first movement of the same would find the more chamber-like transparency of textures of Abbado \\"miniaturised\\". De Gustibus non est disputandum.<br /><br />But they are wrong, of course, and others don't need to be deterred. It is only a pity for the Carmignola-Abbado bashers that they remain deaf to the great musical beauties offered by these artists.<br /><br />Like: the transparent and lean orchestral textures that never let the basses go muddy or the horns and oboes covered, the wonderful timbral character of the latter, the rhythmic crispness of the strings, all offering muscularity without thickness.<br /><br />Like: the creamy tone of violist Danusha Waskiewicz, and the wonderfully hushed and intimate dialogues with Carmignola in the two cadenzas.<br /><br />Like: the lively and dynamic tempos in the outer movements, exuding an irresistible (well... obviously not to everyone) joy and exuberance.<br /><br />The Carmignola-Abbado bashing also begs the question which approach is truer to Mozart's indications. Sometimes we are so accustomed to a certain, traditional approach, because it is the way we've always heard it and the way it has always been played, that we fail to notice that these are not, by no stretch of the imagination, the tempos written by the composer. And when an interpreter finally plays the piece at what can be reasonably considered as the composer's tempi, we are shocked. It was exactly the same reaction when the Michelangelo frescoes at the Sistine Chapel were removed of centuries of patina (painting conservators call it \\"dirt\\"): the traditionalists were horrified at the loss of the chiaroscuro, the garish colors - only neglecting the fact that this is exactly what Michelangelo had painted.<br /><br />Well, I will grant that Mozart's indication at the top of Sinfonia Concertante's first movement, \\"Allegro maestoso\\", legitimates the more held back and beefy approaches (and even the good traditional approaches don't lack dynamism and explosiveness here); Still I find Abbado's lean and transparent textures, muscularity without weight or thickness, and sense of exuberant joy irresistible. But the Finale is a \\"presto\\", so anything goes as long as it gives the impression of being fast. But I must make a special case for the middle movement: it isn't by mistake or through slapdash carelessness that Mozart wrote \\"Andante\\" here. From the Italian verb \\"andare\\", to go, to move. To generalize, the middle \\"slow\\" movement is a romantic invention of the mid-19th century. Even Beethoven didn't write slow movements in his symphonies. First Symphony? \\"Andante cantabile, con moto\\". Second: \\"Larghetto\\" - not Largo, mind you, and the 7th: \\"Adagietto\\", not \\"Adagio\\". 5th: \\"Andante con moto\\", 6th \\"Andante molto mosso\\", and 8th tops it all: \\"Allegretto scherzando\\". And even when he writes an outright Adagio, as in the 3rd, 4th and 9th, his metronome indications belie the notion that it is \\"slow\\", as we understand it today.<br /><br />Back to Mozart and his Sinfonia Concertante: ever since the early recordings from the 1950s, the tradition (of which the afore-mentioned version of Oistrakh is also a good illustration) has been to take his Andante more like an Adagio or a Largo, turning the music into a solemn, brooding movement in the style of the Masonic Adagio & Fugue. And there is no denying the beauties of that approach, the moving pathos it produces.<br /><br />But, other than the fact that it is certainly truer to Mozart's \\"Andante\\", there are also many beauties in the more flowing approach of Carmignola-Abbado. I find that it elicits a mood of emotional inquietude that makes it more truly \\"pre-romantic\\" than the more overtly romanticizing of the traditional approach through dragging out the tempo and thickening the textures. But certainly, to hear and be sensitive to that mood of inquietude requires to cleanse your ears and mind of any expectations of  Masonic solemnity and pathos.<br /><br />And it is nothing new, you know; In fact, it is striking how close Carmingola-Abbado's timings are to those of Heifetz and Primrose (but of course, Heifetz was often accused of playing everything too fast, by listeners unable to understand his very special artistry and musicianship, [[ASIN:B000003EQ9 Double Concerto]]). And, at his very slightly faster tempo in the Andante, I find that Heifetz brings out even more clearly that mood of inquietude. But while Carmignola-Abbado's first movement is faster than every version I've heard except Heifetz (but I've heard very few on period instruments), look at the Finale:<br /><br />Sammons-Tertis-Harty in 1933 (not what you'd call brainwashed HIPsters, would you?): 5:56 ([[ASIN:B000BTQG8A Father of Modern Viola Playing]])<br /><br />Heifetz-Primrose-Solomon 1956: 5:48<br /><br />Oistrakh-Barshai Moscow 1960: 5:55 (brainwashed HIPsters, truly? [[ASIN:B000U1PU36 David Oistrakh Plays Doubles]])<br /><br />Carmingola-Abbado: 5:51<br /><br />(And for reference: Oistrakh Berlin 1972 6:08, Harnoncourt 6:25, [[ASIN:B008L450NO Mozart: Sinfonia Concertante, Violin Concerto, Kremer, Kashkashian]])<br /><br />So how's that for, as another reviewer has put it, Carmignola and Abbado's Finale disappearing before you know it? If so, at least there is a long tradition for it.<br /><br />OK, that's only for Sinfonia Concertante, the piece I am the most familiar with and which landed me on this entry in the first place. I'll return later, and in due time, to the concertos. But what Carmignola, Waskiewicz and Abbado offer there augurs well for the rest.

0451169514|5.0|I havent read many Stephen King books. He puts in a lot of detail that doesnt need to be there in most of his books. I read It when it was recommended to me by a fellow book lover. Personally, I loved this book and it ranks up there in the top out of the King books that I have had the chance to read...and I've read both bad and good ones.<br /><br />Some of the reviewers on here complain about the length of this book. I personally dont have a problem with long books especially when all that length builds up a book that you cant put down. The characters in this book are extremely well written. You get to follow them through the most important part of their childhood and their adulthood. This book is long, but i dont think much could have been cut from it and kept the integrity of the story intact.<br />My only real issues with this story are the same things a lot of reviews have a problem with (SPOILER ALTERT). I was not thrilled with the child orgy to get out of the sewer scene. Really? There really wasnt a need for that. I also wasnt thrilled with Bill and Bev sleeping together, Bill cheating on his wife to do so, just for Bev to end up with Ben (whom Bill said should have been with her anyway) and Bill to go back to his wife. The situation makes it seem like cheating is OK because they wont remember it in a couple weeks anyway.<br /><br />Other then taht, the book is great. Scary in places. It holds interest.

0099579936|4.0|Having read a few reviews about this trilogy some of them good, some of them bad and some of them very bad, I thought I would air my views too.<br /><br />Is this the best read ever, definitely not.  Are there any similarities between Twilight and Fifty Shades?  Personally I can't see it unless you count the fact that they are both addictive reads. I have read all three in less than a week.  It took me less to read all the Twilight series.<br /><br />I agree that the sex scenes are badly written and too frequent.  I am surprised that Ana can even walk by the end of the first book.  However I found that by the second book, i had started to skip over the sex scenes because they are immaterial.  The real story is the charting of the continually changing relationship between the two characters and Christian's emergence into \\"the light\\" which although sometimes corny, is both humerous and touching.<br /><br />The fact is, if you are looking for classic literature then don't waste your time but if you are looking for a book to curl up with and escape for a few hours,then look no further.

B003VDZK8K|1.0|With every album released, it appears that Avenged Sevenfold becomes more commercialized and less hard core. I give Sounding the Seventh Triumph (2001) four stars and Waking the Fallen (2003) four stars. With City of Evil (2005), you begin to see Avenged Sevenfold try to reach out to a larger audience, an audience that likes ballads and cheesy metal, which is why I give City of Evil 3 stars. The Avenged Sevenfold (2007) album continues this trend and then some, but, still has some songs that rock. I give the Avended Sevenfold album 2 stars. Their latest release, Nightmare, is a total piece of cheesy garbage and I give it one star period! If you like thrash metal bands like early Metallica and Slayer, then listen to their first two albums Sounding the Seventh Triumph and Waking the Fallen. If your idea of metal is Poison and Motley Crew, then this album is for you! There are people here giving this album 5 stars, which is insane. I think that the type of people that generally write reviews for albums are huge fans of those bands, so, it is really tough to get an accurate assessment on Amazon. Look at reviews for most any album and you will see five stars and \\"Best Album Ever\\" used over and over again. If you think hardcore means intense, fast, energized music, then stay away from this steaming pile of fecal matter. However, if you like metal bands once they lose their edge, start making songs for movie soundtracks, slow down their music so they can sing ballad like wuss songs, and sell out their original hardcore fans for a larger audience of wannabes - then this is for you.
B0072OFM28|4.0|Im keeping it short and hope that someone who created spartacus reads and takes this into consideration. I loved the 2nd ( 3rd ) season hands down. 2 problems I had, why the original nivea wasnt used was a big disappointment. The lady playing her now is awful. That ruined it for me, shes a bad actress and nowhere near how pretty other nivea was. Most importantly, take your hand off the slow motion button. Please it was just too much slow motion in this season. Almost every swing or stab was slowed down. I pray they dont do that again in the next and final season. But if they do, im still going to watch lol

B000I5SY9Q|5.0|I am completely blown away. Every so often we get a movie that defies time and is important.  This is the absolute best movie that I have ever seen where the subject matter was actually revelent and current. Tell Lie Vision Snooze has become everything but objective, relevant  and fair. A must see and an eye-opener for all.
B007Z1FD7M|4.0|After seven years of inactivity, Robert Fripp had the sudden idea of putting King Crimson back in action in a form of a double trio. This idea materialized by the recording of the mini-album \\"Vroom\\" in 1994. After some rehearsals, the newly incarnation of King Crimson arrived in Argentina for a series of concerts that are available here for the first time on DVD. They took the video from the archives and added the sound from the digital multitracks. They had to do some editing on the video and a lot more work with the audio.<br /><br />There is two shows from the same day. It is shot by TV and don't have the same quality as a professional DVD. In fact, it's pretty evident in the out of focus shots that we have from a camera. They have tried to resolve this issue by incorporating some clear shots in those unclear shots. For the audio, we have a 4 channel DTS sound that i would have appreciated more if my home system didn't have distortion noise on one back speaker. I had the same problem with a Pain of Salvation's DVD that has a 4 channel surround.<br /><br />The performance and the set list are excellent on both shows, with some old classics like \\"Red\\" and \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\\", that are still enjoyable to listen after many years. This is a band that have made some very original and challenging music over the years, that made them a band ahead of his time. That's why their music is interesting no matter what period we are looking at.<br /><br />This is not the best way to be introduced to the band, previous DVD are more appropriate, but for The King Crimson fan, this is a nice addition to his collection.

B000MQC9H4|2.0|One of the the dvd covers was in poor shape inside and out. It didn't even hold the dvd in place, it was ripped no the front and it wasn't even taped securely shut.  The overall shipping package was not glued or taped shut and it appeared someone had actually opened the package to check out the contents somewhere during the shipping process. One of the dvds seems to play pretty well but appears to have scratches.

B005LAIHPY|2.0|If you enjoy a mindless pointless story then this might be the movie for you. It seemed an awful lot like a transformers type movie. I think that even some of the sound effects were the same. But overall this is just a plain no frills action movie. All common sense was left behind. Sure the acting captain of a ship will leave the bridge to go fight an alien that has boarded a ship.... yeah right... it is just little things like that that ruin movies making them just plain stupid.

B0087BRHPK|4.0|When I originally heard about this book, I had very little interest in reading it. A boy's coming of age story just didn't hold much interest for me. It wasn't until Emma Watson was cast as Sam in the movie version that I decided to read it, although I did read through a lot of reviews beforehand.<br /><br />Charlie is an interesting narrator. He is not the overly mature voice that a lot of YA authors give write. Instead he looks at things in a very simplified manner. Charlies wants to belong, to fit in, and he rides the line between childhood and adulthood. There is a simplicity in how he looks at things, such as the rape scene some many reviewers had a problem with. Charlie is no older than eleven when a guy rapes his girlfriend in front of Charlie. A lot of the reviews claimed it was stupid of Charlie not to understand what was going on, but I thought it was a realistic event. Charlie had no knowledge of sex, living a sheltered life, and was scared. he knew something was wrong but not what or even why.<br /><br />The supporting characters were interesting, they had distinct personalities Charlies interactions with them felt real. There was a bit of a question as to why these seniors wanted to hang out with a kid younger than them, but in their first meeting it seemed like Patrick and Sam were amused with Charlie's naivety, and he just gradually melded into their group of friends.<br /><br />Charlie does begin to wear thin after a while, and despite the professed intelligence that his English teacher credits him with, there is a question of whether he has not only emotional problems but psychological ones as well. He allows his friends to use him and strives to be anything and everything they want him to be. I actually found Sam's speech to Charlie at the end of the book to be a very revealing look into her character and why she was so accepting of Charlie.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the book, I think the movie has the potential to be even better, although my Hermione Granger love may be influencing me :)
0439023521|5.0|Loved this book, the world Suzanne creates is so well written I immersed myself completely and I really felt for the characters. I would recommend The Hunger Games.
B008F5YDRI|2.0|OK, I so agree w/ another reviewers \\"spoilers\\" ....this film had alot of potential.<br />But if you dislike adultery, boring, long drawn out, non-witty , blah scenes...then you can miss this movie and your life will go on as usual without every skipping a beat. I hate movies who do not catch my attention in the first 20 minutes. Don't get me wrong, I love British movies of all kinds, but this one was just...ummm, boring.<br /><br />The concept, I know was and it was supposed to be metaphorical,but realistically....war is war...it is not pretty, no matter what movies a Country puts out, it will never change views that have been ingrained for thousands of years. This was a vanilla attempt at \\"making a statement\\" that it didn't quite make. All it (movie)  stated to me was, cheat on your wife, money can buy anything, the media will do almost anything (no wait, it will do anything), to align public views w/ it's on agenda, and that it is ok to make a movie this boring and expect people to spend 10 dollars a pop to see it.
B006VZS1EA|5.0|I really enjoyed the story line here. At first I thought it was just going to be about some guy who failed at everything and then in the end realized his dreams and whatnot, but I was actually very touched by the plot and found myself almost crying a couple of times. (I'll admit, I cry fairly easily.) However, the characters were developed significantly well, at least well enough for me to feel anxious at points when they had to overcome problems. And I liked that the main characters were given room to grow, as well. All in all, it's not Rocky, and it's not just digital rock'em sock'em robots, but if you're looking for a cute story of trials and the value of second chances, then definitely watch this movie. =)
B0088RQ4TI|5.0|This was a video download using my Prime account. It was a good movie and my entire family enjoyed it. Prime downloads work well and quality was ecellent over my Comcast internet connection. This was a wireless delivery from my Netgear 3700 v2 router thru our PS3 in the family room. Wouldn't mind seeing a sequel to this movie if they make one. Based on an Edgar Rice Burroughs novel and it is referenced in the movie as part of the plot. Very intriguing.

B004XXIHS2|4.0|In its first section, A Kiss Before Dying tells an absolutely riveting noir tale of a money-chasing young man who finds out that his meal ticket may have ended up pregnant and has some concerns about getting rid of the child. What could any amoral young gold-chaser do in such circumstances? And what follows is a riveting tale of a young sociopath convinced that murder may be the only way to proceed. It's a great tale, and builds effortlessly to a great climax...but all of that only really contains the first third of the book. What follows from there all comes as a result of that tale's conclusion, as investigations come together, mind games are played, and people do their best to learn about people they think they know. Here's the thing about the rest of A Kiss Before Dying: there's nothing wrong with it at all. It's interesting enough, and has at least one twist that's pretty surprising and beautifully executed. But what the first section does is immerse you in the mind of a killer, and Levin's narration does a beautiful job of creating the mind of someone capable of justifying their own actions in any circumstances, no matter how horrible they may be. It's a fascinating, compelling voice, and with the shift to other narrators in the remaining sections of the book, Levin casts aside his most interesting and intriguing character in favor of some who don't grab the reader nearly as well. That being said, the book is still fascinating enough; it just never attains the heights of that first section, and what follows is a lot harder to become as riveted by.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is great to play when u just need something to do. Once u start it is hard to quit playing.
0345803485|5.0|I have read many reviews on this book. You have to look at a book for what it is. This is no Classic Novel, nor is it a book for everyone. It is however a love story. The author makes it an easy read and keeps you wondering if you really want to know what is going to happen next. Ultimately, most of us do. It is a fun book for the die hard reader or a harlequin romance kind of reader.<br /><br />I know people from 20 to 65 that have read the book and loved it. At times, you can't believe what you are reading but you just keep going. As many have said you will either love it or hate it. If you look at it as a fun read I think you will love it.<br /><br />You cannot over-analyze everything. If you are that type of person - this book is NOT for you. If you like a bit of fun and shock - You will love it!<br /><br />Beware - you may want to kill Christian Grey at some points!
0525423281|4.0|LatBND is the story of Dolores \\"Lola\\" Nolan. She lives in San Francisco with her two dads, Andy and Nathan, and her adorably named dog, 'Heavens to Betsy'. Lola is basically Lady Gaga in the body of a 17 year old, she dresses in the most elaborate outfits she can imagine on a daily basis and has a goal to wear never wear the same outfit twice. Much to her conservative gay fathers dismay, Lola is entrenched in a passionate romance with a 22 year old meter maid who doubles as a gritty tattooed rocker. However, the plot thickens when a set of twins reappear in the lavender house next door, one of which is a stuck up ice skater and the other is the titular 'Boy Next Door' that Lola has long known and for many years has tried to forget.<br /><br />  The book resembles 'Anna and the First Kiss' in many ways and it even takes place within the same universe in a time period close to the preceding novel. Anna and Etienne work at the same theater as Lola and make irregular appearances in the book, living in San Francisco because they go to colleges across town from each other. Their presence is reassuring and at times delightful (I missed Etienne, did anyone else miss Etienne?) and never over-bearing or reduced to lazy writing. I especially liked the fact that the book threw a couple of short jokes Etienne's way, humanizing him a bit so that it was clear that not everyone idolized him like a walking god.<br /><br />  Lola is a great narrator and she is very different from Anna. While Anna tried to please everyone and was very sheltered, Lola is more wild and extroverted. She likes making statements and going to concerts and being seen with her older boyfriend. On the other hand she (usually) follows the rules set by her parents and she respects them and what they think, she is a vegetarian, and she doesn't drink or do drugs. Lola wears her heart on her sleeve and you follow her moods and dreams and goals through her constantly shifting but always over the top fashion choices, many of which she creates herself. While I considered Anna to be someone like me or one of my friends, I considered Lola to be more like my younger sister whom I love dearly and occasionally feel the protective need to fret over. The Boy Next Door was charming and likeable, and I think it was interesting that you didn't really get to know him until you learn more about and appreciate his resistant twin sister. In fact, many people in the book are presented in a caricatured fashion and then revealed in deeper, fuller detail, which adds much more emotional resonance to the story.<br />I loved this book and would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Stephanie Perkin's 'Anna and the French Kiss' and also any Sarah Dessen fans.<br /><br />For the full review and more on books by Stephanie Perkins, John Green, JK Rowling, and also Doctor Who and Sherlock, please visit my blog at [...]he creates herself.

B004V01VUS|5.0|I never thought I would so love a fairy tale, but this book was several kinds of wonderful. I use the word 'wonderful' purposefully, because it was full of wonders. This book felt like entering Narnia as a young girl when I read 'The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe' for the first time, without the catered explanations offered by Lewis to carry a child through the story. The story brought out the best of the old tales without shielding the reader from the tragic harshness of them: a cursed prince in the form of a mouse looks for a magic acorn to break the spell, but he just gets eaten by a hawk because hawks eat mice. So what is this book about?<br /><br />  The city of Wall is surrounded by a wall and the city residents have long since steadfastly guarded a doorway in the wall which leads to Faerie. Once every 9 years the people of Faerie hold a market and the people of Wall cross the doorway to engage in trade. You first meet Dunston Thorn of Wall, but mostly the story follows his young son Tristran. As young men, they both engage in agreements for love that have consequences they could not have imagined. For Tristran it was pledging to his love to the lovely Victoria, who asks young Tristran to retrieve a falling star in exchange for a kiss. The star in question landed over the wall in the land of Faerie, and no one crosses the wall. Tristran does.<br /><br />  And so begins an epic journey, first and foremost a quest for a fallen star, which has many formidable pursuers. Tristran finds that Faerie is as dangerous as it is beautiful, and that nothing is as it seems. For one, the star is ... a person: young woman with pale hair, shining skin, and a broken leg from her terrible fall. Despite her adamant refusal Tristran struggles to take the star back to his girl back home, though the complications just keep on coming until a good old fashioned Fairy Tale is told.<br /><br />  'Stardust' is for those who grew up reading the 'Chronicles of Narnia' or 'The Lord of the Rings,' or anyone who can appreciate the beauty and mystery of the world and also of love. This book has an addictive style and pacing, and an excellent story.<br />For the full review and more on books by Gaiman, Rowling, Fitzgerald, John Green, along with reviews on Doctor Who and Sherlock visit my blog crazykenna2@blogspot.comRings,' or anyone who can appreciate the beauty and mystery of the world and also of love.

B005POK858|3.0|why does it says HD on the icon but not in the game , does anyone know why is that ?
B004Y1USV2|3.0|While it's hard to fault the decent effort made by all on this themed album, the way they summarily ditched Jon Anderson replacement Benoit David is indicative of how badly this iconic band has hit the skids.  I would only recommend the one-disc studio cd: avoid the deluxe with the concert DVD.  The live songs are, for the most part, played at half-speed and you're not really missing much by not seeing Yes in concert these days.  Since this was recorded, they've replaced the replacement singer with a fourth-rate neo-prog \\"vocalist\\" who sounds like Neil Sedaka or one of The Chipmunks.  This thirty-year-plus Yes fan has spent his last nickel supporting the downward spiral of standards that this version of Yes has chosen to follow.  Sad, really.

B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Owen Wilson is in modern day Paris waxing poetic about the romance of the city to his unimpressed fiance Rachel McAdams (Mean Girls) while touring with an insufferable pedantic know-it-all. Owen Wilson writes popular but forgettable screenplays and wants to be a novelist like the generation of American writers that flocked to Paris in the 1920's, though no one is particularly interested in his ambitions.<br /><br />  One night Owen Wilson abandons his group to take a walk in the streets of Paris and not surprisingly gets completely lost. He sits on a corner at midnight and gets picked up by a old fashioned car which takes him straight to a party in 1920's Paris. He comes face to face with Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, though at first he insists in thinking that the entire party is an elaborate ruse. Although he comes to accept that the party is really happening and that these people are the writers and artists he admires, at dawn it once again seems impossible that any of it could have happened. But in the coming nights he catches the same car at midnight and meets Hemingway, Picasso, Dali, Gloria Stein, Matisse, and others, talking about their most famous ideas and even getting an assessment of his own writing. Owen Wilson falls hard for a 1920's woman who was Leo's wife in Inception. Meanwhile, in the present, his night time wanderings catch the malicious suspicions of Mean Girl's father, and Mean Girls drifts further from Owen Wilson and closer to pedantic know-it-all.<br /><br />  As someone who grew up admiring the paintings of Dali and Picasso, and was so recently charmed by Fitzgerald, this movie was absolutely fantastic. The cinematography was gorgeous, the music was divine, the acting was over the top and hilarious. For example, Hemingway spoke like he was reading the most dramatic sections of his novels, which my sister referred to as 'Book-Speak', and his constant bravado had me applauding when he yelled, 'Who wants to fight!?' Fitzgerald was every inch the man I imagined and kept calling people 'Old Sport' like Gatsby did. I thought for a second Matisse was Freud but no such luck, it seemed to me a criminal missed opportunity not to feature Freud in a Woody Allen movie. At the end, the movie had a great twist leading to a solid revelation and message for the film, and it ends on a high note. I recommend this film to anyone and everyone, for the great success achieved in atmosphere alone.man I imagined and kept calling people 'Old Sport' like Gatsby did.

B004QOB8SO|5.0|My Review of BBC's Sherlock: Series 2 (No Spoilers, Sweetie)<br /><br />YES! Every episode was fantastic! The writing and stories were even stronger than the first series. As someone who has read some of the books and is familiar with Sherlock universe, I can say that I have never seen a better translation of the mysteries into full length stories.<br /><br />The performances:<br />  Benedict Cumberbatch was brilliant as Sherlock. They take chances with his character and put him in challenging and unfamiliar territory, which is fascinating and compelling. Martin Freeman was fantastic as John Watson. I used to consider him 'Arthur Dent' from that disappointing 'Hitchhikers Guide' movie, but now Freeman is irrevocably John Watson. He balances out Sherlock perfectly. It is Watson's job to show the appropriate situational reactions and help Sherlock in cases, but he also stands up to Sherlock which is just as important sometimes. John was quick to form loyalty to Sherlock, but his faith in his friend is repeatedly tested in this series.<br />  The actress playing Irene Adler (Lara Pulver) was provocative and smart. She owned the role so thoroughly and convincingly that I feel a little embarrassed for Rachel McAdams, who is entirely forgettable in comparison. Honestly I wouldn't recognize them as the same character. The chemistry between Irene and Sherlock was palpable yet tantalizing, because Sherlock is Sherlock and he has no idea how to deal with people, let alone, 'The Woman'.<br />  Last but definitely not least was Andrew Scott as Jim Moriarty. I was impressed with the plans and actions of this maniacal foe in the last series, but when you saw him... well, his voice was a bit goofy. However, when you pick up with Jim in the second series you are more familiar with how he operates and what he is capable of and his detached demeanor becomes downright menacing. In spite of this I found myself excited whenever he was on screen. he is suave and surprising (and dressed to kill).

1936608898|5.0|I purchased 2 copies of this book on preorder probably a half year before it was released, since I had attended a Whole9 workshop 1.5 yrs prior. I gifted one copy to my married children in Israel. Well, what can I say but I was NOT at all disappointed. The book is awesome with a lot of new and updated information but truthfully it is simple. I have since purchased more and have recommended the book to several others who all got a copy and are following their Whole30 too!<br /><br />Following the advise has helped me regain my life at an age when most are having the opposite issue. I went from being a 200+ # woman to coming in now at 135# at 50 years old. It really is simple. It just starts with food!

159514188X|4.0|This book is about a character named Clay Jensen, a Valedictorian candidate and all around 'nice-guy' who finds a package without a return address full of audiotapes. The tapes are from a friend named Hannah Baker who had recently committed suicide, and they tell her story in her own words. Clay is one of 13 people scheduled to receive and listen to the tapes because of his involvement in her death. Many of the people in the list hurt or betrayed Hannah in some way. Clay listens to tape after tape to discover the nature of his scar when he cared for her so much, but too late.<br /><br />Apparently no one taught Hannah how to use a webcam.<br /><br />  I liked the method of story telling and found it very effective. Everything you hear Hannah say is after she had decided to kill herself, and it is a story of heart break and resignation. Everything she says was chosen deliberately to present her case and tell her story. Clay makes the perfect person to react to the story, because he was also present for many of the events described in the book. He offers the perspective of what depression looks like to an outsider, and how the events she presented affected other people. Unlike many of the people in Hannah's life who thought she was looking for attention Clay wanted to help but had no idea how.<br /><br />  The book is called 13 Reasons, but it should be called 13 People. It is about how our actions affect other people and how important it is to listen to and care for one another. It is also about how a suicide affects everyone that person knew and came into contact with, which is something equally important to show in my opinion. I thought it should have gone into more detail about how to get help for those considering suicide, but I am sure there was a website listed in the back or something.<br /><br />Take this subject seriously. There isn't a funny caption here, get help if you need it.<br /><br />  I had the opportunity to listen to this as an audiobook and it is an experience I recommend to anyone considering reading this book. The book follows two characters, Clay Jensen and Hannah Baker, and two different voice actors read their corresponding sections which really gives you a feel for the two voices as distinct entities. As you listen to the short bursts of Clay's reactions to Hannah's story the contrast is glaring and gripping. Though the woman reading for Hannah sounded like she was about 45 for some reason.<br /><br />  The book was depressing, but very emotionally resonant and I think it is an important book for anyone whose life has been affected by depression, self-destructive behavior, or suicide.<br /><br />For the full review and more on books by Stephanie Perkins, John Green, JK Rowling and also Doctor Who and Sherlock, please visit my blog at crazykenna2@blogspot.coman experience I recommend to anyone considering reading this book.

B002SSUQFG|1.0|1. The holes for which the watch band pins fit into the watch are very shallow.  The watch band will easily pop off the watch.<br />2. The watch ran 95 seconds slow every twelve hours.<br />3. The pendulum which winds the watch came loose.  The screw backed out.<br />4. I noticed the spring that holds the tension to drive the watch was not where it should be.  It broke somehow?<br />5. Needless to say, the watch is no longer running slow, it's not running at all.<br />6. The malaysian movement apparently is hit or miss.  Mine was a miss.<br /><br />I was very disappointed in the quality of this Seiko watch. I don't know whether it is the quality of the parts or the workmanship of where it is made.  Either way, no watch should have this many problems especially a Seiko!
B003Z0BWR2|5.0|Another amazing book in The Mortal Instruments series. I love when series books carry on exactly where the previous book left off and this series has appeared to do just that.  No 'Meanwhile... A year later...' just right back where we were.<br /><br />I also very much enjoyed that the author did not spend a lot of time catching everybody up on what happened in the last book. There is nothing worse than being excited to start a new book in a great series and you find yourself reading the same story...  again! Who is going to start a series on the second book? And if a person does do that it's their own fault. This author says just enough to keep you reminded but not so much you get bored.<br /><br />One of the things I have enjoyed most is the author's ability to make you feel as though you are right there.  The details of the place, the smells, the noises... I become immersed in the story.  I also find I am unable to out my Kindle down a lot of the time. I will give myself little goals such as 'At the end of this chapter I will get up to make dinner'.  Then at the end of the chapter I just have to read on and find myself trying to make the same promise to myself at the end of that chapter but it fails again.  Not that I am complaining... This is a good issue to have.<br /><br />I will be starting City of Glass first thing tomorrow.  I am so happy that I started these books at a time when I had two weeks off from work. I would be quite upset if I had to wait until after work to read.
0525478817|5.0|The book is written in the perspective of Hazel Grace, a 16 and a half year old girl with thyroid cancer that metastasized to her lungs. She is on medication keeping tumor growth at bay but she carries around an oxygen tank because her lungs 'suck at being lungs'. Ever since her initial diagnosis at 13 and the plateau in her condition after starting this medication Hazel has been living on borrowed time. She got her GED when it appeared that she would never be able to go back to school but started up some community college classes once she was more stable. In order to get Hazel to 'have a life' her parents insisted on Hazel attending a weekly cancer support group, where she meets Isaac and Augustus. Isaac is days away from having his second eye and his last thread of sight removed because of eye cancer and Augustus had his right leg removed above the knee 2 years ago because of bone cancer. Hazel and Augustus have an 'Edward and Bella' stare-down when they first lay eyes on each other, but as they talk and explore each others lives they have a believable relationship. They have a connection based on mutual admiration and not lust. Neither is delusional about the others circumstances, and both make valid observations and mistakes and jokes and reassurances. They awakened something in each other, it was a boy-meets-girl that was more than just a meeting. They were both human, and I loved them.<br /><br />I thought this would be the story of how Hazel died. That is what I was afraid of, because I liked Hazel. She wasn't bitter, or entitled or stuck in perpetual 'What does it all mean?' that most adolescent protagonists are prone to. Hazel made decisions based on how her actions would affect others, she read poetry and marveled at the beauty of nature, she lived with constant pain and struggled with the question does pain have meaning. She could quote TS Elliot and Shakespeare and video games with flawless ease. In the end, this was not the story of how Hazel died, but how Hazel lived. 'The Fault in Our Stars' is a story about embracing whatever you get of life in the midst of an impossible situation; it is a triumph of humanity in the face of the void.<br /><br />________<br /><br />And Yes I did cry.<br /><br />For the full review and more on authors like John Green, Stephanie Perkins, Jay Asher, JK Rowling, and also Doctor Who and Sherlock please visit my book blog at crazykenna2@blogspot.comhow Hazel lived.

1410427927|5.0|Normally I hate reading non-fiction as when I read I like to read a fake story.... But I gave this book a try and it really did amaze me. It was probably one of the best books I've ever read before in my entire life. I actually used the book for the basis of my National History Day project this year, as the theme was React, Reform, and Revolution in History. I thought this book and topic REALLY tied into the theme and ended up using this topic. Sure enough this topic is highly controversial because she was black and the rights of patients back then. This topic WOWED the judges from all around! From school level to County level, to state level, to NATIONAL level, then I Placed 7th in the Nation with this project. I have seen the HeLa cells, I'm going to the talk Sonny is giving soon and this was just such a FASCINATING story. It's so fascinating it almost seems unreal... like how could anything like this happen? I would definitely definitely recommend this book even if you don't like non-fiction, DEFINITELY read it. Oh my gosh. I'm hoping to see the Henrietta Lacks grave when I go to Virginia in the spring time. Does anyone know where it's located? I know that it's on a family plot, but where is the family plot? I'd love to see it. Love you Henrietta and the accomplishments she's made. Every single person has been affected by these cells sometime in their life time. It's so remarkable. Henrietta,  she may have lost her life, but she has saved MILLIONS of other people's lives.

0142418471|4.0|Will Grayson, Will Grayson is written by both John Green and David Levithan. Each writer tells the story of  their own Will Grayson through 1st person point of view. The stories and the people telling them are very different but the two Will Graysons meet on a night that proves very influential to the course of their lives. WG1 is sheltered and emotionally repressed and WG2 is caustic, angry, and self-loathing. WG1 is friends with the largest, most flamboyant boy in school (ironically named 'Tiny' Cooper), and WG2 has one friend named Maura with whom he reluctantly shares doom-and-gloom judgment and sarcasm.<br /><br />  On the night of the fated meeting of the Will Graysons, WG1 misses out on a concert and possibly connecting with his growing crush Jane and WG2 learns that he will never be with Isaac and that he can never be friends with Maura. After the two Will Graysons meet, they both are thrust solidly out of their respective comfort zones and learn a lot about self respect and respecting others and also about love. While the stories are not parallel, they are intertwined and compliment each other with a fuller truth on what is happening in the story. The different writers and the different narrators really bring this novel from good to great; from pleasant to memorable.<br /><br />  I thought at first I liked WG1 much more, because he had a much more agreeable disposition. WG2 was caustic to the point of burning everything around him. However, it is only when WG1 breaks his own rules and becomes less agreeable do you fully respect him, and when WG2 broke my heart he made me love him passionately and defensively. WG1 has moments of lighter humor and more social interaction while WG2 has analogies and insights that made me laugh out loud with no regard for social conventions.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who has ever fallen in love and anyone who has ever had their heart broken, and anyone with a pulse, really.<br /><br />For the full review and more on books by John Green, Neil Gaiman, Stepahie Perkins, JK Rowling, and also Doctor Who and Sherlock, please visit my book blog at crazykenna2@blogspot.comre on books by John Green, Neil Gaiman, Stepahie Perkins, JK Rowling, and also Doctor Who and Sherlock, please visit my book blog at crazykenna2@blogspot.com
0439023521|4.0|The 4 stars is for the idea and for the possible future that the author describes.  But the story is almost boring, where action does not reach a climax, is predictable, and sometimes things take an unexplicable turn.<br />Still, the idea is great and it makes you think.  Of course it is part of a trilogy, and maybe after reading the rest of the books some things might make better sense.<br />I have not seen the movie, which I think it is good,because it got good reviews so I might have disliked the book more.<br />Bottom line:  Not a bad read, a quick read
0142419400|5.0|Anna Oliphant has the great misfortune of getting shipped off to an American boarding school in France for her senior year of high school by her well-meaning but pretentious father, who is basically Nicolas Sparks. While most people would be ecstatic to spend a year studying in Paris, Anna dreads missing her senior year with her friends, her almost boyfriend Christopher ('Toph'), and her seven year old brother Seany. Things get better once she meets an accepting and interesting group of friends at school, most notably the American-born/British-bred/French-speaking Etienne St. Claire, who happens to be funny and cute and totally endearing.<br /><br />So what is the problem? Is St Claire gay? (No, that only happens to the guys I find attractive) St Claire has a girlfriend, and Anna still dreams about Toph back home. Over the course of the year the two are drawn towards each other through fate and unspoken desire, and the book explores what it means to discover yourself in a foreign place and also to fall in love.<br /><br />Seriously, if you don't laugh out loud five different times reading the first chapter, you don't have a sense of humor. Anna does whine sometimes, but unlike Bella Swan she possesses the strange concept of perspective, and, most importantly, she actually has a personality! She is not merely a mirror to project your own likeness upon to fantasize about the 'perfect' male lead, Etienne. The two have a reasonable relationship, and they even disagree about things now and then. I think I liked the book so much because it reminded me of my time in London: the tense excitement of stepping out into a city where everything is new, missing the little familiarities from back home, and learning how you, yourself, have changed once you returned. I recommend this book to everyone because most anyone would enjoy it, though girls are more likely to embrace the story since it is told from a female perspective. It is a quick read, but it will make you think and dream your own dreams, so it is a meaningful and worthwhile experience.<br /><br />For the full review and more on books by Stephanie Perkins, John Green, JK Rowling, and also Doctor Who and Sherlock, please visit my blog at crazykenna2@blogspot.comm your own dreams, so it is a meaningful and worthwhile experience.<br /><br />For the full review and more on books by Stephanie Perkins, John Green, JK Rowling, and also Doctor Who and Sherlock, please visit my blog at crazykenna2@blogspot.com
B000KKPN5C|5.0|It's not obvious in any picture of this flash, but the flash bulb portion of the flash tilts up so you can do bounce flash with it.<br /><br />For small rooms, this flash is completely adequate. I use it almost exclusively with the OM-400 diffuser (not Nikon). This makes the flash fill the room nicely with out a lot of shadowing.<br /><br />Flash recycle time is very good.<br /><br />Seems like a solid little flash for typical indoor photo situations.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I had a really hard time putting this book down.  There were so many twists and turns, I was anxious to find out what was going to happen next.  Was it unrealistic, yes.  I wasn't looking for realistic.  I was looking for an escape--a great book to keep my attention!  The ending was a little odd, but at the same time it fit with the twisted nature of the whole book.  I haven't read anything by Flynn before, but have already put another of her books on hold a the library. I can't wait to see what else she has to offer!

B007J4T2G8|4.0|Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down.  I kept trying to find what some found so offensive, but never did.  It is \\"different\\", but isn't that why we read, to discover, learn, enjoy, see how the other half lives?  After all, it isn't a manual, it's a fiction novel.  I'm not sure how I wanted it to end, maybe like fairy tales, and that he loved her so much he was willing to give up all of his S/M behavior so they could live happily ever after, on his money!!  Maybe there is a sequel in the works.(well, I just discovered this is one of a trilogy---goody.  Guess what I am fixing to do?  Yep, gotta have the other 2)

B001HN6922|2.0|We received Cars 2 as a DVD rental from another place (outside of Amazon). My 2 1/2 year old grandson devours the original Cars and has watched it perhaps 30 times. He lost interest in Cars 2 in the first 15 minutes. I have to admit it didn't hold my interest either. This is such a radical departure from the original Cars. I think the producer went too far allowing this story line to depart so much from the strong character focus of Cars. Cars 2 also seemed loud, dark, and flashy.<br /><br />This may have been a good video done on it's own but as a sequel I think it fails.<br /><br />We turned it off and returned the disk without watching it all the way through.
B007IX383I|5.0|Every new album by Anathema is different and unexpected, but they keep getting better.  This one is no different.  While I love the older albums like Eternity, I also love this album for the same reasons.  Their music is poignant and strong, no matter if it's the old stuff or the new stuff.  It always says something emotionally  LOUD (not always volume-wise), musically and lyrically.  I find \\"Lightning Song\\" to be one of their top 5, like One Last Goodbye or Inner Silence.  But with every listen, I find more to love about this album.  If I had to place it, I think it reminds me most of A Natural Disaster, but like I said before, every album sounds different.  I can't stop listening to this album, and you probably wont be able to either!

B0007XTOKC|5.0|Elvis is Back! was the first album Elvis Presley released after his two year stint in the army.  Artistically, the album was a triumph on every level.  There was new depth to his voice; his interpretations were increasingly sophisticated; the group was probably the best studio band in the business; the song selection was imaginative and varied, the technical quality excellent.  Most surprising of all, the new album pointed in no one musical direction.  It wasn't unmistakably related to the sound of his previous recordings.  There was no strong country flavor, and only a hint of gospel in the voices of either Elvis or the Jordanaires.  It was as if Elvis had invented his own brand of music, broken down the barriers of genre and prejudice to express everything he heard in all the kinds of music he loved.  This two cd set collects the original album, the non-LP singles recorded at the same sessions, plus tons of alternate takes.  This is the ultimate version of one of Elvis Presley's best albums.

0345803507|2.0|Now that I've read the third in the Grey series, I can officially say, \\"I'm done with 50 Shades, for good!\\" It's definitely one of those book series that is so poorly written and constructed, but it's a guilty pleasure and I just couldn't help but wonder about the characters and their fates! I also see the appeal of the series to the millions of readers who have succumbed to the books--it's hard not to like the idea of a male who adores everything his wife does and thinks she is perfect in every way.<br /><br />In Fifty Shades Freed, Ana and Christian are now married and learning to live with the other's quirks and flaws. But of course, several dramatic turns in the plot threaten their happily ever after. I found the book to be as unbelievable as the second book. Things just didn't add up--Christian completely altered his personality in such a short time, now becoming the perfect husband, with almost no domineering tendencies to speak of? I was entertained by Ana's inner critic, who is pretty amusing. I would only recommend reading this third in the series if you enjoyed the first two books, or if, like me, you couldn't help but be curious about how the characters' stories would end. This book also has a small section at the end called \\"Shades of Christian,\\" which allows the reader a glimpse into the beginning of the first book from Christian's point of view--interesting to read.
B0076UXKDG|2.0|Nikon continues to make very good vertical grips.  However, for the benefit of adding a battery, a couple buttons, and a place to hold the camera in a new orientation - the price just isn't good value.  They under priced the D800, so from that perspective, the total system price is still a great value.  However, I think they misread the market here (and they clearly agree since the product has already dropped $200 in price and seems likely to drop further still).  This is the best grip, but the $100 alternatives are pretty close.  Hard to justify the extra money unless you really want Nikon or really want the incremental best.
B0036T31YY|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie!  Great acting, story, and directing that kept me guessing and glued throughout the film. From it's opening sequence all the way to the very last minute, the film does a good job of building suspense and interest.  This is some clever and imaginative writing that I don't see too often now-a-days. Give it a chance, you will enjoy it!

B005J4ASDG|5.0|Stumbled across this yesterday in a shop and, having been an avid Lord of the Rings fan for many years, immediately bought it. As I already own the original three as well as the complete recordings I didn't expect much. I was pleasantly surprised though - the recording doesn't have that \\"studio\\" polished quality as the score itself, and it's a perfect studying (or, as in my case, driving) companion. I just wish Howard worked on it a bit more and transformed it into a more structured work rather than just a collection of short pieces from the movie that it is.
B001UREJWM|5.0|Let me just start off by saying this CD kicks some serious ass!  If you were ever a fan of the RJD incarnation of Black Sabbath, you're gonna LOVE this CD.  I listen to this and it's every bit as good as the forever classic Heaven and Hell album.  The sound on this CD is just as tight as it was way back then.  RJD's (RIP) voice is as powerful as ever.  When we lost him the metal world lost one of the best vocalists EVER.  Tony's guitar playing hasn't lost a beat.  The guy can still rip it out.  Bass and drums as tight as ever.  This is an incredible CD and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who grew up on 80s metal.  Throw this on, put on some headphones, close your eyes and you'll be in Heaven...AND Hell.
B005GCCJME|4.0|I finally broke down and bought a pair of Crocs because I'm planning a trip to Disney World and wanted a shoe that was supportive and comfortable but that I didn't have to worry about getting wet. It is very comfortable and the sole is very springy.  The down side is you look like you're wearing clown shoes.  I guess it's too much to hope for to have a shoe that's comfortable that's also cute.
0553386794|5.0|Book Title: \\"Game of Thrones\\"<br />Author: George R.R. Martin<br />Published By: Bantam Books<br />Age Recommended: 18+<br />Reviewed By:  Kitty Bullard<br />Raven Rating: 5<br /><br />Review: I seldom read one book out of a series and give a review. Usually, I will wait until I have finished the entire series and then give a collaborative review that sums up the writers complete work. I may be the only one that holds such an opinion, but when I write this I mean it sincerely. George R. R. Martin's \\"Ice & Fire\\" series is not one of those series you could possibly review as a set. My reasons for this assumption are as follows; these books are so in depth so profoundly well-written and so amazingly astute that they simply must have the justice of their own individual reviews.<br />When I started this endeavor I went the route less traveled and actually began by watching the first season on television before ever having picked up the first novel. I actually thought there was no possible way the book could be even remotely as good as the show. Boy was I wrong. Even though the television show follows the book to a `T' there is simply no substitute for the writing genius of the magnanimous, George R. R. Martin. This man has the profound ability to breathe life into his characters to the point that you sincerely believe they were once real. Eddard Stark is the kind of man every child would want as a father, every woman would dream of as their husband and yet he still has a hard edge that denotes a strength unlike any you could imagine. What I love most about George though, is his complete faith in his readers which allows him to take a character like Eddard Stark and kill him just as you're falling in love with him all the while knowing that his many other remarkable characters have captured you so completely in their web that you have no choice but to continue on because you, yourself, have unwittingly become a part of \\"The Game of Thrones.\\"<br />This review must end here because I fear I will give away too much and readers that have yet to embark upon this journey will ever forgive me. I do however, wish the readers to know that once you start you'll never want it to end and you will find that even trying to take a break in between and pick up another book to read is completely impossible. Be prepared to spend a good part of your next few months reading this series and know that it will not be time wasted, yet time well spent enriching and in some cases redeeming your love of great fantasy writing. Now, it is on to book two for me! I'll be back!because I fear I will give away too much and readers that have yet to embark upon this journey will ever forgive me. I do however, wish the readers to know that once you start you'll never want it to end and you will find that even trying to take a break in between and pick up another book to read is completely impossible. Be prepared to spend a good part of your next few months reading this series and know that it will not be time wasted, yet time well spent enriching and in some cases redeeming your love of great fantasy writing. Now, it is on to book two for me! I'll be back!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I like this app very much.  it helps me keep track of my battery life b4 I have 2recharge.  it really works.
B000SLP4SE|5.0|Mark Wahlberg does a great job in this movie. Thought the story line was excellent too. Thoroughly entertaining flick. The first half-definitely piques your interest.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|When I got this ap I wasn't expecting all that this ap has. There's a huge number of Bibles and not only are they free you can download to read offline. There are also a number of &quot;plans&quot; available - 1 year and 6 month Bible reading plans - reading plans for depression, fear of death, dealing with death, youth plans such as those helping to deal with bullying, etc.  I was extremely pleased and surprised and very happy.<br /><br />I like the fact that I can take this ap to church and read my lesson or enjoy the service and I can switch between versions. That is a good thing when we run into questions in Sunday School - having a # of interpretations helps clear confusing passages sometimes when you're discussing topics in class.<br /><br />I just love this ap!  I didn't expect to - just figured it to be yet &quot;another&quot; Bible ap. I highly recommend this ap.<br /><br />Used on my Kindle Fire

1401937268|4.0|At first I wasn't so sure about getting this deck; I had purchased a tarot deck some years ago by Lucy Cavendish, but it didn't contain the Minor Arcana. I stopped using them, not for the lack of the Minor Arcana, but because I wasn't so sure tarot was for me and I didn't really know what I was doing. Fast forward over seven years later, and I decided that I at least wanted to get a user friendly deck that really spoke to my spirt. It wasn't that I didn't have a connection with Lucy's deck, it's just that I didn't know if it was an oracle deck, or a tarot deck and I felt that I wasn't getting the most out of them, which led to misusage and eventually bad energy.<br /><br />Shopping around for a deck was very frightening at first; I was just going to go back to the Women's Oracle deck, because I felt that I wasn't finding a deck that spoke to me on a spiritual level. While looking for some books in Barnes-n-Noble, I came across Angel Tarot cards. They didn't wow me, but I still picked up the box, looked at the art work, put it down and moved on. I decided to do some research on Doreen Virtue, and her Angel cards. What got my wheels turning was a weekly reading video I saw on YouTube. It featured the ArchAngel Michael deck, and everything about the cards seemed pleasant and uplifting. After that I couldn't stop thinking about the different decks. Over the next few days I prayed and mediated, finally I went out and brought the Romance Angels deck as well as the Angel Tarot cards deck.<br /><br />After reading several reviews on Amazon about how large and unpleasant the deck was to shuffle I was instantly leery of the cards, but I decided its always better to experience such things for myself. Once I got home I didn't get to know them right away because I wanted to check out the other deck. Later on that evening I opened the Angel tarot deck and the first thing I noticed was how uncomfortable they felt in my little hands. I was needless to say turned off, I was also turned off by the cards themselves. It was as if they were \\"silent.\\" They didn't speak to me and I felt no connection at all; I kept thinking to myself \\"Great, I just wasted time and money on a deck that I probably wont use...\\" BOY WAS I WRONG!<br /><br />I don't know why I was initially not connected to these cards; but as soon as I cleared the energy and prayed over them, they started yakking away! If anyone does know or have some insight as to why this may have been, please let me know. Learning and something I love to do, and I'd love to get some feedback from a seasoned reader. I started off by doing a three cards spread, and I was so impressed at how accurate each card I pulled spoke to my current situation. I got so impressed with them that I decided to really test the waters and do a Celtic card spread, which is intimidating enough for a beginner such as myself, because I've NEVER had any clarity with reading this particular spread. Well, not this time; the cards were so easy to read, and each position was so on target that it scared the crap out of me! It was as if my closest friend was allowing me to step back and take a look at myself from a broader perspective.<br /><br />Now for the deck itself: The illustration is magnificent, I mean it. Each card is colorful and eye catching, not to mention the detail is exquisite. The Major Arcana is represented by a particular ArchAngel and gives you a little insight as to why that particular Angel represents the card it's illustrated on, via the guidebook. I liked the concept of replacing the Death, Devil, and Tower cards with Life experience, Release, and Ego. It's not that the Death card actually means Death, or the Devil card actually means monster; however we all know that many people, due to many factors take these words to be literal representations. It can be hard for a beginner to restructure his or her mindset to think otherwise. At least with this deck, they can start off with more positive words, that represent the same meanings as the original names.<br /><br />Other names have been changed and I can honestly understand why; again, I'm assuming that she didn't want people to focus on the literal meaning of the original word. A fool is not necessarily a literal idiot, however beginners can have trouble making the necessary adjustments. By calling the card The Dreamer, you do get a sense that this person is eager, untainted, unexperienced, green and full of promise. The Judgement card is has been renamed Renewal; I'm assuming because the word judgement may come across as too harsh, or confusing, or again maybe she just wanted to keep with a positive, more uplifting flow. The only card that I was kind of iffy about the replacement of the name was the Heirophant and Temperance for Unity and Balance, respectively. It could be that when people think of Heirophant they think of one religious denomination instead of a general spiritual aspect.<br />Although, changing the names for a more positive outlook is wonderful it can also have it's draw backs. It can make the learner lazy, and it may keep them from learning how to adjust their mode of thinking, which is what in my opinion makes the Tarot card so unique; it helps us think differently about any given situation or area of life. It can also turn off a seasoned user who is merely looking for a new deck, and sees it as a dumbing down, or a passive aggressive approach to the message the cards can be trying to give.<br /><br />I found the guidebook to be an amazing tool; the despriptions were clear and full, and an additional meaning is offered as well as a description of a type of person the card could represent if needed. This actually helped me read the cards better; offering a wider aspect of why the card may have come up in the first place. I also loved the explanation of why she changed the order of the Justice (8 card) and Strength (11th card). She also explains the importance of NOT dismissing a card that may pop outof the deck while shuffling, which to my surprise always seemed to get to the root of the question I was asking.<br /><br />She used some ArchAngels to represent multiple Major Arcana cards which at first seemed redundant, but every Angel has more than one duty, so it makes since that he/she would appear on more than one card. I also liked the element usage for the Minor Arcana; Air, Earth, Fire and Water. As an earth sign, I felt a particular connection with the imagery displayed on them, but I have a few gripes. First, if this is an Angel deck, why are unicorns, elves, dragons, fairies and mermaids involved? I consider them to be mythical beings, not actual entities like the Angels themselves. IMHO, it takes away from the power and realness of the Angels; almost as if they're being lumped in as just another group of fairytale creatures. I know there are many people who believe in these beings, and no disrespect to anyone who does, but for someone like me who sees them as a cute concept, but not a real force within our universe, it comes across as kind of campy and Tolkien like.<br /><br /> So if there is someone out there who is seeking a way to reach out to the Angels, or someone who may want to get to understand how Angels can assist us, but doesn't relate to the concept of mermaids or, someone like myself who doesn't believe they exist, it could be a turn off. However, I say, don't let the fact that YOU DON'T BELIVE IN THEM, STOP YOU FROM TRYING TO CONNECT WITH THE BEINGS YOU DO BELIEVE IN. My belief is that the beings merely represent the element they appear in. Ex. Mermaids for water, Dragons for fire, Unicorns for air, etc... I also kept in mind that just because I DON'T BELIEVE, it doesn't mean someone else doesn't, and out of respect for all belief and spiritual systems I understand why she put Angels and Elves in the same deck, this deck is for EVERYONE. Again I still think it waters down the concept of \\"Angels\\".<br /><br />Another thing I'm disappointedwith would be the size and comfort of the cards; they're huge, hard to shuffle, and it takes a lot of work to break them in. I  decided that when shuffling the easiest way for someone like myself would be to split the deck in two; shuffle one stack good and proper, do the same to the other stack, bring them back together and do the \\"kiddie shuffle,\\" then cut the deck. It worked and the message was just as accurate, if not more, than it would have been if the cards were a user friendly size.<br />The one thing I do enjoy is the fact that the fairies, elves, mermaids are all represented by multiple races of people. This made me, being a woman of color, feel more comfortable with the fact that she at least understands that many people from all backgrounds will be using this deck, and would enjoy seeing all types of races, and cultural backgrounds represented. Which is why I also understand why the Fairies and Dragons are also used, it's that Universal appeal concept which is again great. It also shows that spirituality isn't just a representation of one being, race, color or creed. However, I noticed that none of the ArchAngels are represented in this way; I guess that would have been too risqué, Kidding!!! :)<br /><br />All and all I really do love this deck, and I find it an amazing study tool and a great choice to actually learn how to properly utilize a tarot deck, without confusing oneself, becoming frustrated, and or feeling overwhelmed. Although the seasoned tarot user may be a little annoyed by the deck's \\"failure to keep it true,\\" a newbie, and or a non traditionalist who isn't caught up in the \\"if it's not broke, don't fix it,\\" ideology will really like using this deck once they've come up with a method of shuffling. Be aware however, once you tap into the angels, and make that connection, don't be surprised if you channel one or two,they pay you a visit keeping you up all night chatting. You'll know them when they arrive; their presence will be strong and soothing, yet awesome and scary (in a good way), at the same time. Simple solution: Thank them for keeping a constant visual over you, paying you a visit, and kindly let them know that you are heading off to bed; after two hours of just trying to tune them out I politely asked them to ssshhhh, and bid them goodnight so I could get some sleep. LOL<br />God Bless, and enjoy!
B0086QS7N2|5.0|this is the Rush band I fell in love with in the late 70's / early 80's! this is the why they are such a great band! trust me, if you love the old hard hitting, well written Rush (like the Moving Pictures days), then buy this album! I haven' like anything they put out the past 10 years or so (+/-), but this album rocks! musically at the top of their game with this album! holy cow, I downloaded the MP3 album expecting typical crappy Rush, but was I pleasantly surprised!! hell, it reminds me of Dream Theater somewhat! Prog-Rock at it's finest right here! if you liked Rush back in their day, then you'll love this album!! buy it now, you won't be disappointed!!
1451627297|3.0|The idea behind this book was a really good one.  I couldn't wait to find out how the world would have been different if JFK had been saved.  Unfortunately, this book was way longer than it needed to be.  I don't know if all the stories leading up to the assassination attempt were necessary or just confusing.  It took a long time before I could really develop an interest in the book.  Once I did, I read it fairly quickly.  The main characters were well developed.  Even very minor characters were well described and interesting.  I felt like a window peeper watching Marina Oswald being abused by her husband.  I don't know if the people mentioned in connection with Oswald were real people or just part of the book.  I also have no idea how much of the information on Oswald was researched and how much was just fiction.  The ending was disappointing.  I wouldn't recommend the book unless the person were really interested in time travel.
B0015DROBO|2.0|The plot was interesting and the characters unique, but the sick depravity of the bad guy really bothered me (which I'm sure was the point). When I sit down to read a book, I'm looking for the beauty of the human spirit in adversity. That's not what this book is about. This book is about the abusive depths the human race is capable of, and the only hope it provides is to encourage us all to no longer be silent and to be vigilant against evil. For me, it failed to conjure hope and instead left me depressed.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|This is a truly haunting film, shot by the wonderful Clint Eastwood, who is maintaining his winning streak that seemed to begin with Mystic River.  The film takes place in 1928 and chronicles the disappearance of a young boy and how the L.A.P.D. grossly mishandle the case.  The events are based on a true story, which make the narrative all the more poignant.<br /><br />Angelina Jolie, not usually one of my favorites, is stellar as the distraught mother, who is put through absolute hell as she tries to find her missing boy.<br /><br />The film really seems to capture the starkness of pre-Depression Los Angeles.  It's a bit corrupt, a bit seedy, and seems a world away from actual civilization.<br /><br />After viewing the film, Wikipedia \\"Wineville Chicken Coop\\" and read about the actual case; it'll make the hairs on the back of your head stand on end.
B001NLKT60|3.0|I liked this much more than the first in the series. The plot, characterizations, and subject matter were more compelling and interesting. Like the first, there's a tendency to wander a bit, but I enjoy books with more meat to them. The first book disgusted and disturbed me. This one gave me thrills and chills and my faith back in humanity. I recommend it.
B007L96VCY|5.0|Paul McCartney was continuing to enjoy his freedom, his family, and his music when he wrote and recorded this pleasant collection of tunes back in 1971.  Paul's world was still rife with acrimony from the tumultuous and very public breakup of his last band.  This did not stop him from not only being creative and prolific, but having a sense of humor as well.<br /><br />Ram seems a natural follow up to his solo debut, McCartney.  Both collections are homespun albums that teem more with musical ideas than fully realized songs.  This, in my opinion, has a certain charm to it.  Like the McCartney album, a lot of the tunes on Ram are fairly short.  \\"Ram On,\\" \\"Dear Boy,\\" and \\"Heart of the Country\\" all clock in at under the 2 1/2 minute mark, yet their whimsy saves them from being throwaways.  Largely an acoustic album, Ram does manage to serve up one hit song in \\"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey.\\"  It's a suite of sorts, and Paul even lets Linda sings a few lines.<br /><br />The bonus disc is a wonderful companion piece to the original album.  It's not second-rate stuff.  On the contrary, it has some lovely playing and writing throughout.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|This woman is amazing. There is nothing her amazing voice can't sing. Her music is so eclectic and fun. Her lyrics can be both fun and serious. I love how she can sing a song like Stronger, where she sounds so bold and daring. Then she can sing a song like Dark Side, and sound so sweet and innocent. The notes she hits on this record are insane. She's got that amazing raspiness in her voice, but at the same time, she has a very soft, sweet voice as well. How rare is that? Over her last few records, she's evolved more as a songwriter, which is fantastic. This record shows that she's really coming into her own. She seems to be a lot more comfortable in the studio now than she used to be. I'm already excited for her next record. It'll take a while, but I'm more than sure it will be another amazing record.
B001AKTZOG|4.0|With \\"Pagan Baby\\" opening this album, CCR sort of misrepresents themselves.  The tune is classic CCR.  Think of the vitriol of \\"Fortunate Son\\" and the guitar frenetics of \\"Ramble Tamble.\\"  Quite simply, the song, at nearly 6 1/2 minutes, rocks.  But it does not at all pave the way for what follows.  The rest of the album, though soulful and melodic, is J. Fogerty exploring other musical passions besides rockabilly and the \\"swamp rock\\" for which he had become known.  The songs on Pendulum borrow their sensibilities from the Stax sound.  There are horns and choirs and tight arrangements.  It mostly works, but it is a very different sounding CCR than the band who released back to back to back albums, all classic, all near perfect, only two years prior.<br /><br />\\"Hey Tonight\\" and \\"Have You Ever Seen The Rain?\\", both wonderful songs, were the hits from this collection.  Not their best effort, but still a solid album.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|This is a fantastic movie although it does not capture the same view as the books it is still exiting and has the same plot.
B0085KGGHI|5.0|Great show.  It's wonderful to see the Stones pay homage to Muddy this way.  They rip through a wonderful set list with the master.  The quality is good; the tunes are great; and the pairing of these musicians is legendary.  Highly recommended.
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is so good I can not even discribe it in words! I love this game so much I became addicted to it!I know you should get it! :)&lt; 3
1466401885|5.0|I have to say this is my new fav book, hands down. I fell in love with Travis's character right away. He has that bad boy exterior but inside he is anything but. I will have to say Abby annoys me a little bit and I wanted to slap some sense into her but after awhile she grew on me. Give this book a chance you wont regret it!
B0086DBE62|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with the mix of reviews.  I enjoyed it. I liked, or had no objections to any of the changes from the original.  Costumes and sets were a treat!  Very entertaining!!!
B000YJ85BI|5.0|This story picks up the relationship between Jane Sagan, a retired lieutenant of Colonial Defense Forces Special Forces, and Major John Perry, of the CDF armed forces.  This was hinted at in the first John Perry/CDF story, Old Mans War.  This story has them together and functioning as colony leaders in a small, first wave seed colony which is endangered not only by their new home, but by many of the races that inhabit space alongside humanity.  I won't even begin to tell any of the story - but buy the book.  Seriously.  This is Scalzi at his best.  The story is told in his usual style which is, well, casual is the best way I know to describe it.  Like he's there talking to you.  You get to like more or less ALL the characters to some degree at least, and you feel what they feel.  It's been a long time since I've read an author I like as much as this one - he handles adventure, peril, hearbreak and courage all equally well, and throws in a large measure of humor and humanity.  The science in this sci-fi is not explored to any extent.  Scalzi is definitely not a hard SF writer.  But her DOES imagine the situations that his science could put people in, and puts you in the world with those people.  More, you simply cannot ask of any author.  Highly recommended, and I also recommend you read Old Mans War before this to get background.  It's not essential but it will increase your enjoyment of this story.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app. I have high anxiety yet I find myself occupied and entranced by layering these relaxing sounds. I get so preoccupied in my customizations that I forget I was stressed out! It would be nice if the app continued to play when its not open, but its still great. I plan on upgrading! Try this app!
B00782O7IY|4.0|I can see why many may not like the movie...after all it is black and white and mostly silent (except for the music)and to be honest it was hard for me to watch it in one sitting especially the first 20 mintues or so but later on I got hooked. Seriously, the first few minutes I was like: \\"Is the whole movie going to be like this?.\\" I came here to check out the reviews and I saw all the 5 star ratings and then I found out that it actually won several Oscars. I then thought that I might as well stick it out and see if it had any redeeming value. I'm glad I did...It's not a fast paced, action ridden movie but in the end I found it to be enjoyable. It's not the kind of movie one might want to watch with buddies while drinking beers and expecting to be entertained right from the beginning of the movie but you might enjoy while watching it alone, with one or a few friends and/or your significant other
B008BM9L72|5.0|Really enjoyed this book (trilogy). There are a lot of critics, out there, 'saying',this book, isn't well written........who cares!! It's a fantasy! Anyway, loved the trilogy & highly recommend. I want more, E.L.James. More, Christian Grey!
B000EULJLU|4.0|10,000 Days I think was surrounded by too high of expectations, and I'm very guilty of that myself. There was so much speculation going into it (decoy albums, fake song titles, a second release in late summer (?), hidden messages, etc.) and all of it was just so far fetched that people were without a doubt disappointed with the final product. But after you let go of what it \\"should\\" have been, and embrace it for what it is, you'll find this to be just as good as Aenima and Undertow. I don't think it surpasses Lateralus, or even Aenima, but its nestled right on the same line as Undertow and Opiate, in my opinion.
B00846REIS|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and found it hard to put down.  I have read it several times looking forward to the next book. I am so frustrated knowing how far October is to the next books release date.<br />The desire they have for one another is so desperate and heartwarming. It is nice to see that one can become a better person if they find the person that they truly love.<br />I hope that she will give him the chance to grow and find she doesn't have to keep running. On the other side, I hope that he won't let others come between them by being over controlling and naive.<br />I hope that the love grows. The thought of they could end up apart crushes me.<br />PLEASE let October come quickly.. I need to continue with reading a great novel.........
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love this app because it wiles great on my kindle fire I think ot is better than where's my water because it is every thing Perry doc. d mater monogram and carol<br />to describe on word to this app it will be awesome. buy it only 99 cents bang for you buck
0070511136|5.0|If you are struggling with sales or just getting started as a salesman, this is your book!<br />Every single chapter of the book is golden, follow the SPIN method and see your sales increase.
B000V1Z8KK|5.0|I found this film to be excellent! It is definitely NOT cheaply made and it has an intriguing story line that doesn't get boring. You will be on the edge of your seat until the credits are rolling. Lots of realistic violence but it doesn't get unnecessarily gory. The language is to be expected from an R rated film, however, there are no sex scenes or embarrassing parts. The main character and his fallen comrad's widow clearly have some affection for each other, but the directors did a remarkable job of keeping to the story and leaving the sex out of it. I really appreciate that. Definitely a \\"must see\\"! I loved it!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is so amazingly clever it is hard to put down as the twists and turns of this woman's (Amy) diabolical mind seems to be unfathomanaly endless. I would have given this book 4 1/2 stars had there been that option because I did not like the ending at all, but I can't myself think of how it could have ended other than several of the fears one has while reading it. I definetely recommend reading this book!
030758836X|1.0|With all the good reviews on this book I just knew it was going to be good. This book is terrible and boring a serious waste of money!
B008IJTFYW|4.0|works good. one thing I didn't like is that for me the timer did not work I set the timer and it is still on the next morning. otherwise so fair so good.
B008MEM24S|4.0|My two boys 7 &amp; 4 are very much enjoying the game. It plays like Where's my Water which they also enjoy!
B005LAII3U|1.0|The original \\"Total Recall\\" still holds up despite being made back in 1990. The special effects are a little awkward at times, but overall it fits the overall tone of the film. It doesn't take itself too seriously, but isn't completely over the top which is perhaps why it still stands up today. Getting your ass to Mars, pulling tracking beacons out of your head through your nose, being hit in the crotch over and over again, and talking to a puppet attached to a guy's stomach only added to its early 90s goodness. So the people behind the remake decided to strip all of that away and throw in a bunch of ridiculous eye candy. It just doesn't feel the same.<br /><br />\\"Total Recall\\" is now based entirely on Earth and we never even go to Mars. The movie makes it a point to bring up visiting Mars as a Rekall option and it only seems to rub salt in the wound. Colin Farrell is now Douglas Quaid/Hauser, Kate Beckinsale is Lori, Jessica Biel is Melina, and Bryan Cranston is Cohaagen. The action movie is so redundant though. Every fight scene seems to feature Kate Beckinsale sliding on her knees and/or running on the wall/ceiling and Colin Farrell taking cover behind something before jumping (usually in slow motion) to another platform.<br /><br />There was some hope that Bryan Cranston would at least make some part of this worthwhile since he's so extraordinary on \\"Breaking Bad,\\" but he's only around during the final act and his performance is mostly forgotten thanks to you being mesmerized by his Donald Trump hairstyle. Usually you can appreciate homage in film and be absorbed in the adventure currently being presented to you. With \\"Total Recall,\\" it's like it's trying so hard to be \\"Star Trek,\\" then switches gears and jumps to \\"I, Robot,\\" then \\"Minority Report,\\" then \\"Blade Runner,\\" then \\"The Fifth Element,\\" and the list just keeps piling up. Wearing your influences on your sleeve is one thing, but \\"Total Recall\\" seems to have too many ingredients in its watered down recipe.<br /><br />While the three breasted prostitute does appear with unclothed breasts (yes, all three of them), it isn't enough to save what is otherwise just a mess of a movie. There is so much unnecessary content thrown in just because it looks cool like the glowing neon tattoos or the gravity switching transportation that has a really lame payoff. When Hauser first meets Matthias (Bill Nighy), Nighy is talking like Hugo Weaving did as Agent Smith in \\"The Matrix\\" films. It probably doesn't help that he greeted Hauser by saying, \\"Mister Hauser,\\" and their conversation that followed felt awfully similar to Neo's conversation with The Architect in \\"The Matrix Reloaded.\\"<br /><br />There was that \\"South Park\\" episode where they say the word \\"s**t\\" 162 times in the span of a half hour (episode title \\"It Hits the Fan\\"). \\"Total Recall\\" rivals that as that word is said so much that it begins to lose its meaning. The original had a countless number of crotch shots and the remake is full of s**t.<br /><br />The final product is this really big, juicy piece of flashy, streamlined, anticlimactic, tiresome, candy coated garbage that is just boring. It's as if the movie borrows from not only the original \\"Total Recall,\\" but several beloved sci-fi films and it never really is able to establish its own entity. Every action sequence is nearly identical to the last while the excessive blockbuster is overflowing with unnecessary content. Kate Beckinsale and her donkey faced acting are around for entirely too long and Jessica Biel is utterly useless. \\"Total Recall\\" is like shoving streamers and sparklers in a huge pile of crap and trying to pass it off as a party; no matter what you do to it it's still crap.<br /><br />The Blu-ray for the Mind-Bending Edition of the original \\"Total Recall\\" is around $10-$12. Buy that, stay home, and be happy or go to the theater, see this, and shove your parking valet's face through the windshield of someone's brand new car because you're so enraged that nobody even had the desire to \\"start the reactor.\\"t nobody even had the desire to \\"start the reactor.\\"

B007UXTG8M|4.0|Shame is very moving. It also presents an accurate depiction of a sex addict.  Although neither McQueen or Fassbender are not sex addicts, at least not publicy, they were able to portray the sex addict in a way that resonating with me (I was in a relationship with a sex addict).  Fassbender's performance was compelling.  When he fell to his knees and went into the fetal position because of the pain he was in from his addition, I was moved, it felt real, I could feel his pain.  I highly recommend this film not for it's \\"entertainment\\" value but for a look into the life of someone who we rarely see or think about, the sex addict.
0060955775|3.0|Quick read that posed some interesting ethical questions. It would be more effective if it weren't so heavy-handed.<br /><br />I didn't hate Veronika as much as other readers did. She's lucky to be so pretty, smart and loved. Yet she has a crisis of meaning. Should she be more grateful for her good fortune? Probably. But, this is nothing new. The theme of unfulfilled youth is as applicable today as it was in the '90s.<br /><br />Whethor or not I liked the story itself, this novel gave me an opportunity to *think*. I appreciated that.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Glad I did not buy this book but instead was given a copy in the school yard. The mother pressing it into my hand explained guiltily that it was \\"mummy porn\\". I thought, ok why not, I like a bit of erotica from time to time. Sceptical but willing to give it a go, I quickly felt my brain turning to sludge as I read the main female character repeating the phrases \\"holy cow\\"  and \\"oh my\\" to all variety of situations. I did persevere but then I realised I had to keep my wits and dignity and stop before it was too late. Life is too short to read bad books.<br /><br />Sure, the sex scenes are titillating, but really, a beautiful young virgin who does not understand her allure and a mysterious controlling Adonis. Please. I'm not saying there is not a place for a book like this, but to make such a fuss about it when it is really just a bit of badly written erotica. Is it that people out there don't know they can get erotica if they want it? You don't even have to endure a misogynist leading character and uninventive dialogue. Maybe it got better after I stopped reading? What was the final \\"holy cow\\" count? Now to make sure Amazon understands what I think of this book so I get no related suggestions!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Couldn't get past 40%. This book makes me want to gouge my eyes out and cry for womankind.<br /><br />The story is awful.* The writing is worse.

0061726826|3.0|I'd vote it a 3.5 if I could. Typical teen romance with a dystopian twist. The setting itself provides a great premise (and would facilitate a fantastic film), but I couldn't help feeling that I would have appreciated it much more as a younger reader. I found the second half infinitely more interesting than the first. Fantastic ending!<br /><br />I liked it enough to want to see where the series goes...
B003VANOFY|1.0|I have had this headset for a couple of months now.  Overall, it is very nice.  It installed easily, the sound is great (I am not a sound expert though), and people I have VOIP conversations with say it sounds very clear.<br /><br />The reason that it gets 3 stars instead of 5 is because in order to conserve battery, it shuts off if it does not receive any output within a certain number of minutes.  This is nice for saving battery life, but when I am receiving a phone call, and I have to turn it on and off several times to get it to reconnect, it makes it difficult to use for phone calls.<br /><br />Update:<br />It is dead already; the battery will either not charge, or discharges in minutes.  Very disappointing.
1400052173|1.0|In medical school, I learned about the connection between p53 and cancer, but to insinuate time and time again that her family deserves money because she had cancer and they took a biopsy of her cancer, is ridiculous.  While this book was a fascinating historical peek at early cancer research, it later became a non-stop whining piece about somebody wanting something for nothing.  Her ancestors did nothing to earn any money.  The researches spent their time and energy and money, yes THEIR money, to develop this research.  I grew quickly annoyed with the non-stop whining.  This overwrought sense of entitlement is what is wrong with some people in America.  What happened to actually pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps and making your own future?

0393061310|1.0|At first, I was interested in this work for a different historical perspective. However, it turned out to be disappointing because of both its superficiality and its wrong and absurd conclusions, one of which is that white people were aggressive and genocidal while the rest of the world's inhabitants were entirely peaceful and never engaged in warfare or genocide (so you see, everything evil in the world is because of white people). By contrast, he positively gushes about non-white achievements in a truly absurd fashion, e.g., stating that because Africans had settled throughout the continent in small communities, thereby reducing the effects of malaria (wrong), that that was \\"an extraordinary achievement\\" (!). Diamond claims that the New Guineans have remained primitive because of their poor agriculture and that non-Europeans were defeated partly because of disease, yet in Africa the natives had good agriculture and livestock and the diseases decimated the Europeans, yet they remained in the stone age through the first half of the 20th century (and in some parts, that is still the case). You can't have it both ways. Also, in eastern Asia, as soon as European culture came into contact with Chinese and Japanese cultures, the latter adopted those advances and incorporated them into their cultures and have advanced to a very modern stage. In Africa and New Guinea that is not the case. Again, why?<br />And when did living in mud huts comprise \\"an outstanding civilization.\\"
B008M34INW|4.0|I watch a lot of movies so finding something worthwhile watching is often hard. After scanning a few dozen titles I reluctantly chose this one not expecting much. In the end, I am glad I did. As one reviewer stated \\"Mel is back!\\". Maybe not completely. He's obviously older and looking a little worse for wear but the unique, strong leading man magic that made him successful is still there. Not one of his best movies by any means but good all round entertainment when compared with many of the current offerings out there.
0465068367|5.0|Some history writers forget that there are readers at the other end of the book they're writing, and believe that reciting gruesome facts is enough to tell a story. Iris Chang understood that she needed to retell the story of the Rape of Nanking so that modern readers would care and be outraged. She offers us heroes too, unlikely ones, especially John Rabe, the German Nazi who had lived most of his adult life in China, and who stood up heroically for the victims of the Nanking genocide. The book offers a stark truth about heroes; sometimes, they end up really getting screwed in the end. A man can be the most ordinary person who engages in one of the most heroic acts of the 20th century, and still end up dying in obscurity, poverty, all of one's heroic acts forgotten by the rest of the world.<br /><br />It's doubly tragic that Iris Chang herself became another victim of the ghosts of Nanking, committing suicide after the book was published, leaving behind a husband and an infant son. After reading this book, which I've had to walk away from several times because of the intensity of emotion and anger it causes for me, I can't even begin to imagine how difficult it must have been for Chang to interview survivors, document their stories, look at diaries, documents and personal collections of photos of the Rape of Nanking.<br /><br />I finished this book learning a few important things besides the details of the history of the genocide in Nanking. If you ever have the opportunity to witness history first-hand, take a lot of pictures, and make sure you get that film (in our modern world, it would of course be digital images) safely into the hands of someone outside the country as soon as possible. This is what some foreign observers did, because they knew that without photographic evidence, nobody in the outside world would ever believe their stories.

B00782O7NE|5.0|I went to see this movie in theaters because I wanted to be able to say I saw a silent film in a theater. But it is so much more than that. The Artist is a love song to the glory days of Hollywood, a time we have never been able to recapture and never will. It is also a history lesson wrapped up in a lot of fun. The only other movie I know of that depicts the troubling and, for some, ruinous time of the birth of talkies in Singing in the Rain. However, the Artist takes it one step further and tells the story in the way it would have been told at the time. The aspect ratio, the cuts, the music, the directing, the scenes, and the silent aspect of the acting all come straight of the period and all are wondrously compiled into a compelling movie even for today's audiences. I predict that this film will be one that film students will be discussing for decades to come.

0525478817|5.0|This was my first John Green book. I have heard mixed reviews on his books and the levels of content in them, so I was a little skeptical before picking this up. The story starts a little slow, not too slow though, and is just interesting enough to propel you into the next chapter. After a chapter or so I found myself not wanting to stop reading, literally! This book is mesmerizing in more ways than one. The characters are all realistic and you are sure to fall in love with each and every one of them for some reason or another, the story is straight forward but still keeps you guessing, and the emotions in this book are plentiful! This is a book I think everyone should read at least once.

B001AQR3IU|3.0|Being a big fan of the book Stardust by Neil Gaiman I had high expectations for the movie. For the most part it went by the book, but some things were different and did not have to be. The way the story begins in the movie is different than in the book and in fact there is a character who is added and not ever in the book, just a little odd. The movie itself is a fantastic adventure with brilliant effects and a superb story. Like I said though, being a fan of the literature I was just a tad disappointed at parts.

0060575913|5.0|I have seen the movie Coraline many times before, but never read the book until recently. I was happy to find that the book and movie are so close to one another, aside from the fact that the young boy in the movie is literally not in the book at all which was a little odd. The book is easy to read, set at a middle grade level, and I found myself wanting more! The world Neil Gaiman creates is horribly magnificent in the way it is creepy and wonderful all at once. If you liked the movie, or like Neil Gaiman's work then you will love this book. If you have never read any of his books or seen the movie then I still recommend this because you will more than likely become a fan based on this book.

If you think the description of this book sounds interesting, chances are you will enjoy the entire book. The story jumps around a lot from character to character, but you will find you actually like the way it is written once you get into it, Neil Gaiman does seem to like that writing style.

1594744769|5.0|At first I was worried that I had picked up the wrong book because the story starts out in a way you would not dare expect after watching the book trailer. It does take some time to pick up on the main story and for you to become interested with the characters, but you will find that this is a process well worth enduring. The story is enchanting and the experience of this book is one of a kind! Why has nobody else made a book that is interactive like this one? By the end of the book I was in love with the peculiar children and wanted to be in their world myself.
B005JE7WKI|4.0|Set deep in the swampy wilds of West Virginia, Tucker And Dale Versus Evil (2010) is a mostly effective spoof of the backwoods horror genre, as a couple of buddies have some deadly encounters with a group of \\"college kids\\".  The gore is deliberately overdone, but the humor mostly avoids being too dumb or heavy-handed.  Seeing the numbers dwindle, as the students bumble around in the woods, is mostly a fun time, although the film has a less than perfect finish.<br /><br />Hillbilly types Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Tyler Labine), are on their way to fix up a cabin in the woods, when they run across a group of students at a general store.  Dale is fascinated by the beautiful Alison (Katrina Bowden), but approaching her carrying a scythe, only manages to terrify her and her friends.  Led by Chad (Jesse Moss), the eight students head into the woods and set up a camp, and are doing some moonlight swimming when Ally trips, and falls into the water.  Out on the lake fishing, Tucker and Dale rescue the unconscious girl, but when they call out to her friends, they mistakenly believe that the hillbillies have abducted her.<br /><br />Ally wakes up the next day, and finds that her rescuers mean her no harm.  She hangs out with Dale, while her friends have gathered outside the cabin.  Proceeding on some incorrect assumptions, what follows is a series of goofy mishaps, that results in the gory deaths of the earnest but misguided \\"college kids\\", and a law enforcement officer.  The deaths include a couple of impalements, and one genius accidentally diving into a wood chipper.  The body count continues to rise, until the plot takes a turn, as one of the students is revealed to have a secret agenda.  When Tucker is hurt, Dale steps forward to rescue his new love Alison.<br /><br />Co-written and directed by Eli Craig, the film gets off to a good start, and moves along briskly.  A backstory involving killer hillbillies emerges as the death by accident ploy has worn thin.  Dale, Alison, and Tucker, make a good team, but with three heroes and only one villain remaining, the writers evened things up a bit, by putting an injured Tucker on sidelines.  So instead of Tucker and Dale gloriously saving the day, we have Dale limply employing some tea leaves, to conclude his grand hillbilly's fantasy.  It's not the most winning of finishes.<br /><br />While great fun, and definitely recommended to fans of backwoods horror, perhaps the large number of bad horror comedies, makes Tucker And Dale vs. Evil appear to be better by comparison than it really is.  Tyler Labine is terrific in his role, and he and Alan Tudyk ([[ASIN:B0000AQS0F Firefly]], [[ASIN:B004ZJZPXO Serenity]]) make a solid team.  The inability to feature them together at the end, seems like a huge missed opportunity.  The rest of the cast does a very good job, particularly Katrina Bowden (30 Rock), who also works especially well with Labine.son, and Tucker, make a good team, but with three heroes and only one villain remaining, the writers evened things up a bit, by putting an injured Tucker on sidelines.

B006GHA9QQ|5.0|To anyone reluctant about purchasing this DVD because of the venomous lashings served out by pedantic Phantom die-hards (those lucky, but aging few who actually saw Crawford and Brightman perform back in the day and consider all else sacrilege), PLEASE, DO NOT ALLOW THEM TO SPOIL YOUR OWN ENJOYMENT! The music and set design have been so completely revamped since the Ramin/Sierra London show (which, although underwhelming visually, is preferable vocally to the Australian cast with the exception of the Giry's) that the lushness and spectacle so treasured in the original comes back full force. I saw it in theatres and was blown away by the dervish of colors, the post-London lyrical adjustments à la Charles Hart, and the character revisions that metamorphosed the Phantom back into his menacing/blackmailing personage.<br /><br />The new production's book almost revolves more around the artistry, the craft, and the importance of music in Christine and the Phantom's lives than the seduction clung to in the original. Their relationship has matured such that music's mutual hold over them is the basis of their union, as well as the reason Raoul is so incomprehensive regarding Christine's psyche.<br /><br />So yes, the story is a tad watered down, but take LND for what it is, not what people delusionally supposed it would be: a good musical.

1936608898|5.0|ISWF is different than most food or \\"diet\\" books out there because Dallas and Melissa Hartwig aren't actually writing about WHAT to eat - their true purpose is uncovering HOW you eat, and HOW what you eat makes your body FEEL, then helping you find the problems in your current HOW, and helping you discover the HOW that is healthy for you.  The WHAT to eat is merely a consequence of that.  The Hartwigs cover how food interacts with your body, how it interacts with your brain and thinking and emotions, and the many ways in which most people's food habits are actually hurting them.  After thorough but understandable and easy to read lessons in physiology, biology, and psychology, they carry the reader right into their flagship program, the Whole30.  Already a highly successful program published on their website, the Whole30 information in the book is deeper, more thorough, and more helpful than anything else they've provided about the program before.  Thirty days of allowing your body and mind and relationship with food to heal.  I'm at the tail end of a Whole30 right now and can honestly say I'm feeling great, have gotten stronger while losing the extra few pounds I gained over the last year, and enjoy both what I eat and how it makes me feel.  The key piece of this book, however, is not even this Whole30 program.  The key which makes this book worth the investment is their instruction for AFTER your Whole30 - how to use the Whole30 to conduct an experiment of one and see exactly how different foods affect you.  You gain valuable knowledge about yourself and how you engage with food, so that going forward you can make choices that are smart and informed for your best interest.  In short, this book is a guide to food and you, and you walk away with the knowledge and empowerment to take responsibility for your overall well being through the food you put in your mouth.  ISWF has a prominent place on my bookshelf.
B001F0WXY0|4.0|Review of the novel itself:<br /><br />I had planned to give this e-book to my son as part of a long-running series of introductions to the classics of science fiction that began with Heinlein juveniles when he was young. I read Dune (on paper of course) in about 1980, and thoroughly enjoyed it at the time; I've picked it up and re-read bits of it from time to time over the years--I still find I enjoy the writing and the world Herbert created, and can open this book to almost any page and just delight in re-reading for a few minutes. Of course, some of the themes seem to fit better in the 1960's than 2010's (e,g., drugs to access special mental powers), and some seem dated even for 40 years ago (e.g., gender roles and re-creation of a feudal social structure), but all in all I enjoy this work much more than other books that re-create an essentially feudal social structure in a high-tech future, and some bits I find more plausible than most modern SF (like the explanation of why there is no significant computer technology, which is a bit of a leap. But it is consistent with human nature and, unlike a lot of SF, not actively inconsistent with computing technology, information theory, etc.). I never really enjoyed the many other books set in the universe of Dune, though I did read the two that were available about 1980. But the 535 pages of paper that were the original \\"Dune\\"--those were great.<br /><br />Review of the eBook and art of publishing:<br /><br />Returning to the subject of the e-book edition, I was initially put off by the \\"Kindle Version Review\\"; but (as that reviewer pointed out) Amazon does not seem to attach reviews to specific editions, so I couldn't really tell if this review still applied to the current ebook. I got the free sample, and found almost none of the errors that others have reported; I spent the money to buy the full thing, and so far (35%, up to page 184 of 474) I've noticed very few problems ... I had Kindle search for one of egregioustypos pointed out by another reader (\\"stulsuit\\", I think it was) and did not find it. All in all, the errors are few and far between (see below).<br /><br />In case anyone cares, the errors I've found by page 184 are several joined words and two other minor issues:<br />* Page 4, italics are missing (this was the same in the GoogleBooks edition, suggesting that the publisher gives the same file to all ebook providers)<br />* Page 42, two cases of joined words: arevaluable and dealingwith<br />* Page 71, \\"iong\\" should be \\"long\\" (an interesting error, as noted below)<br />* Page 106, hypen should be an emdash (\\"heavily armed-slow-pellet stunners\\" should be \\"heavily armed--slow-pellet stunners\\") [Rats ... in the \\"preview your review\\", I can see that my unicode emdash has been turned into a pair of hyphens. Hopefully you get the idea]<br />* Page 176, joined words \\"nosign\\".<br /><br />I actually checked some of these (and a few other things) against my old paperback and the printed 40th anniversary edition (I had to visit a bricks & mortar bookstore); the above are differences between the print and eBook (e.g. the mis-print of \\"Harkonne\\" for \\"Harkonnen\\" on Page 16 is there in both paper and eBook versions).<br /><br />The pattern of errors suggests an interesting theory about the creation of printed books and eBooks: on page 71 of the printed 40th anniversary edition, the word \\"long\\" has a slight gap in the ink of the first letter, making it look almost like an \\"i\\" (though to a human eye, clearly still an \\"l\\" with a gap). It looks very much as if the publisher (a) prints the books from physical type rather than e.g. a phototypesetter (I'm guessing this is cheaper; possibly the type set by a machine, based on a computer file), and then (b) *scans* the printed text to produce the eBook (which seems, to me, odd almost to the point of inexplicability).<br /><br />Overall Summary: I'm glad I got this, and look forward to giving it to my son.
0812993292|4.0|There's nothing surprising in this quintessentially English love child of \\"The Sense of an Ending\\" and \\"Forrest Gump\\", but it is well executed, avoids the worst excesses of tweeness and makes you care about the central figures of Harold and his long estranged wife, Maureen. Harold's impromptu quest to walk from his home in the southwest of England to the extreme northeast seaside town where a woman he once knew is dying, seems at first to be a bit contrived and metaphorical, but Fry grounds his travels in simple experiences that pull his trip back from the brink of absurdity and into the realm of plausibility. As Harold's path meanders northwards his recollections and growth follow a similarly sinuous progress. The way to Berwick-on-Tweed is not as straightforward as it would seem from looking at a map, much as dealing with being human is also filled with detours and digressions. The ending is well earned and quite satisfying and I can see why this first novel was long listed for the Man Booker Prize despite it's conventionality.<br /><br />Fry's distant and clean narrative voice, which echoes the restraint of self that has been Harold's defining characteristic in life, also serves to save this modern take on a pilgrim's progress from the bathos that overwhelmed \\"Forrest Gump\\". This is a gentle book, and although you know that Harold will be redeemed, how he works his way to admitting to himself what is behind the steel doors of his memory is worth reading despite the fact that careful readers will know from the beginning much, if not all, of what he is withholding.

B007R21JJK|5.0|Very nice board, very heavy and solid.<br /><br />Built a system with this a couple of months ago, utilizing an Intel 3750K processor, 2x4GB G.Skill Ripjaws X memory, and a Sapphire Radeon 7850 PCI 3.0 video card hard-coded to GEN3 in the BIOS, along with two system boot drives in a RAID 1 configuration.<br /><br />It's been rock-solid and stable, running Intel Turbo-Boost (set to take the processor up as high as 4.0Ghz from 3.4Ghz), with the memory running in Turbo mode with the XMP Profile enabled, and with the latest \\"official\\" BIOS (F11).<br /><br />There was only one issue, which almost caused me to return the board to Amazon.  When I first powered up the system (before installing the graphics card), I had the monitor plugged into the on-board video output.  There was no video.  The BIOS would boot up, and stop with what looked like diagnostic code \\"Ab\\" on the LED (\\"Ab\\" is \\"Detect SCSI Devices\\"), with the monitor saying \\"No Signal\\".  I couldn't get into the BIOS.<br /><br />At first, I assumed that the board was dead, and I'd have to return it.  Then, some searching on the web revealed that \\"Ab\\" is often a mis-reading of \\"A6\\".  \\"A6\\" is \\"BIOS is waiting for a command from the keyboard\\".<br /><br />A little experimenting revealed that if I powered up the system with the monitor disconnected, got to \\"A6\\", and THEN connected the monitor, I would get video and could work in the BIOS.<br /><br />This was inconvenient, but once I got my graphics card installed and connected the monitor to the graphics card, everything worked as expected.  I considered knocking a star off for this, but decided to treat it as a minor startup transient.

B002VL3R1K|4.0|Mein Kampf is a book that can't be measured by conventional standards. The yard stick that is required to understand this document is unconventional. With that being said, Hitler lays out his whole plan in one work and shadows future dark events in Europe and the world from 1933 as Chancellor of Germany to 1945 as Fuhrer of Germany. Please keep in mind that this is the recipe book that all the world strongest powers such as Germany, England, France, Italy, Russia, United States and Japan would participate and conduct history that would change world and cultural history forever. Hitler shines a little light to us into his childhood as an early youth in Austria and progresses to show and tell us why the German nation shall rule the world. From a literary sense, Adolf Hitler does a deplorable job. Looking at it from the standpoint of trying to convince a broken German society and concoct bigotry doctrine and propaganda, he excels in. This work that should be taught in universities all around world as a sole class to breakdown the true essence of Hitler, postwar World War I Germany and World War II. I will say that this book isn't for the faint of heart, and it's the type of reading that requires frequent breaks to digest the material. This is a message of bigotry and hatred and there's no way you cut it to make any sense. After reading this book, explains why the modern western world is the way it is and changes you as an educated reader and as a person. It raises the questions of the role of government and society that requires you to do more reading and soul searching.

B008ODZEQ0|5.0|By happy coincidence, this movie came out just as I was ordering my sushi kit for home. The story of Jiro, his restaurant, and his staff is one of those great people stories, made all the better by its revolving around food. Artfully filmed with a perfectly accompanying score, you may just find yourself planning a trip to Tokyo after seeing it. A truly wonderful documentary all around.<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />- Rodney

0307887960|5.0|I'm your typical woman. I've struggled with my weight since I hit puberty. Always a little on the chubby side. At my heaviest, I weighed 178 lbs. at 5'7. I slowly worked my way down to 145 over the next two years (the old fashioned way) and felt better than ever. But then, of course, I got pregnant and struggled to get the weight off AGAIN. I've pretty much maintained a weight of 150 average over the course of my life with some peaks and valleys in between. And I'm finally sick of it. That's why I bought this book. I'm on day 4 of the attack phase and I've lost a pound a day since I started. Yes, the first two days are tough. But by day number three, I wasn't even feeling hungry and I felt great! I highly recommend this diet if you need a jump start to your weight loss -- it's definitely motivated me. And I know that if I stick to the diet, I will get down to my jr high weight of 134. I can't wait to be that small again!

B005KTZ05G|5.0|I received my Ezio figure about a week ago, right as I was finishing up the first part of his story in Assassin's Creed II. NECA has done a great job with this figure in every regard. Ezio is extremely detailed, very poseable, and just a great representation of the character overall. I currently have my Ezio perched high above my room on the edge of a shelf; he looks ready to leap down and assassinate any intruders at the drop of a hat :D In fact, my Ezio took a leap of faith the other day, I think I moved one of his legs out of position by accident, but like the master assassin he is, Ezio suffered no harm.<br /><br />This NECA Ezio figure is a durable, highly detailed figure sure to make any fan of Assassin's Creed happy.

B005DTX2R6|4.0|Good book for kids.  This is the second book in the series; however, the story is almost entirely independent of the first book.  (That storyline picks up again in the third book.)  What I like best about it, besides the fact that it's a mystery well told, is the way it explains the legal system to kids in easy to understand terms, but without seeming like it is trying to teach pre-law.  I've really enjoyed reading this series.

1419387243|3.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower has been out for a long time and I finally took the time to read, er listen to it. The audiobook was on sale. Over the years Perks, has received a lot of great praise. It's been a New York Times bestseller, it was a cult hit, lines from the novel have been quoted around the world, and it's even been made into a movie. For all the hype, I have to admit I was expecting something more. It's not a bad story but whatever the message was, it was lost on me.<br /><br />To be up front, this book features difficult teen social situations, sexuality, sexual abuse, drugs and alcohol, and mental health issues. If you are not in the mood to go in depth about these subjects, quit while you are ahead. The story is told through the journal entries of Charlie, a 15 year old socially awkward but brilliantly smart high school student. Charlie starts off the story by taking about the suicide of his best friend. The death is hard on Charlie, and to make things worse, he enters high school without friends. Luckily, Charlie finds some upper class men who befriend him and seem to get who he is. Through these friends Charlie is introduced to some new experiences (cue the drugs, alcohol, and sex). As he goes through these experiences, Charlie reveals more of his past and the reader learns more about what happened to Charlie to make him the way he is.<br /><br />There were two factors that made me not enjoy this book, the narrator is the first and the sheer number of social issues featured is the second.<br /><br />The Narration<br /><br />I strongly recommend reading this book instead of listening to it as I don't feel the narrator did a very good job. The narrator is clearly not 15 years old, and to imitate a teenager he talks in a funny high pitched voice. Charlie's character has a strong sense of innocence about him and the narrator makes Charlie seem dumb instead. After awhile, the narrator's voice wore on me and I regretted choosing the audiobook over a paperback.<br /><br />The Social Issues/Drama<br /><br />There are a lot of social issues in this book and definitely overwhelming at times. Reading a book with this many problems may be fulfilling to some but I'm not among them. I can see how a book about these topics can be refreshing for some but for me it was tiring. I feel shallow saying it but in all honesty there were just too many social issues in this book. Way too much. On top of it, it's told from the perspective of 15 year old who really doesn't entirely understand what's going on. Also, these issues are never really resolved. Time passes and things get better for some of them. In other cases, the problem bubbles up later. With no resolution, the story felt like it lacked plot. The author may have been going for this, since in a way it's like real life, but at the end things felt unfinished.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Overall, I wanted to like this book, I really did. There were so many great things said about it but I didn't really see it. I think the author is talented and he wrote some poetic prose. His story also held my interest but in the end I was disappointed. I don't think I can tell you what the perks of being a wallflower are either.aperback.<br /><br />The Social Issues/Drama<br /><br />There are a lot of social issues in this book and definitely overwhelming at times.

B0076L9W9Q|5.0|This album is good rock 'n roll.  This is one of those albums you can listen to without skipping any songs...for the most part.  I like the 2 ballads, but they are probably my least favorite on the album.  \\"I Miss the Misery\\", \\"Here's to Us\\", \\"Love Bites\\", \\"American Boys\\" are some I listen to over and over again.  Really, this album rocks. Buy it!

B002BX4VEK|1.0|I've been a fan of EP for a long time but I have only his original biggest hits (from the Sun/RCA recordings) in my collection and the Viva Elvis recording which I liked since it provides a modern interpretation of some of his top hits. I purchased this CD after listening to a raw audio of the American Sound studio recordings on Youtube. While the song production is fine on the CD, I feel that some of the recordings have been overproduced. I really enjoyed listening to the raw audio of the original studio session recordings without all the horns, backup singers, etc. and all the other add-on production to the tracks (i.e just Elvis and the Band). The overproduction appears to diminish the urgency and power of his voice on some of the tracks. Also, some of the song ending fade-outs removed his interactions with the band and that disappointed me since it shows on the raw recordings that he is really grooving with the band in the studio (probably similar to live performance). The band that supports Elvis in the studio is good but I felt they were a bit subdued when they should have been just cranking it on a few of the tunes (maybe this was the band standard playing style). Unless you are a diehard Elvis fan, you can skip a purchase of this CD and instead download the individual tunes you really want for your collection. There are other compilations that are probably better. I know that Elvis liked to explore and use his voice on a wide variety of material but I found this CD had too many soft pop/country ballad type tunes. I would have enjoyed this CD a lot more if it had more of the up-tempo R&B style tunes such as Stranger in My Own Town, I'm Movin On, After Loving You, etc. Nevertheless, I'm sure all the tunes on the CD will appeal to some diehard collectors out there. In summary, my favorite tunes on the CD were:  I'm Movin' On, After Loving You, In The Ghetto, Hey Jude, Stranger In My Own Home Town, Suspicious Minds, and Rubberneckin'. As for the rest of the album, well, I'll probably never listen to those songs ever again after the first listen.

B0083GQ2A0|5.0|I have watched most of Liam Nesson's work and I personally think hes a phenomenal actor, and this film in my opinion is another example of that. I have read many of the reviews on the movie as most people didn't like it very much, but I do not agree with them. I will agree partially that the film is portrayed in the previews as an action movie while it is truly not. In reality it is more of a Man vs. Nature film, or a Survivalist film. Even though i wasn't expecting this when i went to the theater (from seeing the previews) i think i actually enjoyed this movie more the way it was made. Liam Nesson is not the only good actor in the film, although I think he was the best, many of the side cast members are good as well in there respected roles. I don't like giving away the entire plot like many of these reviews do, but i will say if you are looking for a good film to watch, I would watch this.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I can't imagine why this book was rated a 4 to 5 star book. I thought it was terrible. No one is that stupid.
B005SZADQS|2.0|This series begins rather promisingly, but by episode 7 I no longer cared what happened to anyone.  Really wanted to like it and gave it as much of a chance as I could. Weak character development, repeated scare tactics that become increasingly less scary.  The re-enactment of Columbine style shooting is in poor taste...still..(hope no one involved ever sees this show) Heard the show was nominated for some awards, though I can't imagine why.  Never get this $20 back.  Darn.
B002VKE1K2|5.0|This one of my all-time favorite horror movies! This is one of those movies that people either love or hate, and if you be patient and keep an open mind then I bet you'll enjoy the movie.<br /><br />PLOT: A average everyday couple begins to expereince paranormal phenomenon in their house, especially while they sleep.<br /><br />PROS: .The movie has a dark suspensful atmosphere that will definitely cause you to look over your shoulder while you watch it.<br /><br />  .The actors are just average people like you and me yet they're better than half the people Hollywood puts in movies today.<br />  .No gore or blood at all until the last 2 minutes of the film yet it is still scary.<br />  .The director had a extremely low budget and look what he did with it<br /><br />  Cons: .The film takes about 20 minutes before anything scary happens.<br /><br />So that's it for my review.  The film is defintely worth your money.<br /><br />Special Features: Alternate Ending (the theatrical ending is better in my opinion but that's just me.)

0345803485|1.0|There's nothing believable about this book. I bought it because of all the hoopla and am still wondering why everyone's so enthralled. The whole storyline is ridiculous and, frankly, disgusting. I have no desire to read any other books by this author. And a movie.., no thanks!!!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|ok so I just downloaded it and I love the Angry Birds Seasons. My favorite season is Halloween so I played the season and I loved it!!!
B003Y5H574|3.0|Crazy, Stupid, Love starts off on a promising note with several hilarious segments that hold the story together pretty well, but halfway through the comedy falls by the wayside as the romance takes over.  Steve Carell and Julianne Moore play the role of a married couple... for about a minute, and then they get divorced and spend the rest of the movie wondering if they made the right decision.  For a while I was laughing pretty hard- their son finds himself so to speak and tells the babysitter that he was thinking about her while doing it, and a \\"relationship\\" between the two of them occurs.  The other side story involves Emma Stone having her own romance which is a tacked on, unnecessary and uninteresting waste of movie time.<br /><br />Seriously, the teenage son having a romance with the babysitter was actually the most interesting part of the movie.  The only other interesting segment involves Steve Carell's character rocking the cradle with a woman he meets at a bar, and when Steve and Julianne Moore's character visit their sons teacher, surprise surprise- the woman from the bar was the teacher!  Keep in mind Steve Carell had no idea she was actually his sons teacher, and Julianne Moore didn't realize the two of them were involved (at least sexually).<br /><br />Other than the babysitter and the teenage son trying to impress her, I was totally bored with this one.  More romance than comedy is a recipe for failure.  I suppose the babysitter falling for Steve Carell was interesting, but was never developed enough to feel like you're watching an accomplished piece of movie writing.  Alright, I suppose the part when everything came to a head and the men were wrestling and fighting in the yard was good.  This is when the cat is finally out of the bag and the entire family finds out who's been having a relationship/affair with who.  Skip it.

B005POK858|4.0|I've been trying to find an Android RPG since the G1 days. Finally, installed this and have been pleased. The controls are simple and intuitive. Graphics are almost exactly like FF3 (FFVI), which is a good thing. Battery friendly, not too graphically intensive, and easy to play for 10-15 minute at a time. You can save anywhere, which is a must have on mobile platforms.<br /><br />Edit: Finished the game in under 10 hours, which included collecting every item and grinding. The skill system is unique and was fun to use. The story was average at best with tons of cliches and standard RPG \\"save the world\\" drama. The game was extremely linear, and there were zero sidequests. The story felt rushed, as travel from town to town was short. New weapons and armor were available in each town, and it usually wasn't worth buying. When you could afford it, it was obvious that you'd receive something better in twenty minutes of playing.<br /><br />Overall, it was a fun game, but had many faults. For a couple dollars, it gets the job done, but don't expect something as well rounded as a console game.

0345803485|1.0|I'm so glad I borrowed this series from a friend and didn't have to pay for it.<br /><br />The horrible, juvenile writing style aside (which many reviews have covered before me), I'm trying so hard to understand what all my friends see in Christian Grey and why they think he's so wonderful. Sure, he's rich and good looking, but he's also domineering, a stalker and VERY controlling.<br /><br />If your daughter or a friend were in a relationship where they were clearly unhappy and crying all the time at the drop of a hat, surely you would advise them to RUN from that relationship? It's a very unhealthy image to give to readers, ie no matter how unhappy you are in a relationship, as long as he's rich, good-looking and the sex is great, stay with him.<br /><br />What do women see in him?

0385535139|4.0|The Litigators by John Grisham is an absorbing, exciting read that I had trouble putting down, and wanted to get back to whenever I wasn't reading it. It's wonderful escapist fare, and I'm grateful. He seemed to have an excellent grasp of his characters and their employment situations, and the way pharmaceutical companies work, enough to be credible and make a fast compelling plotline that moved along very well. Should be made into a movie.<br /><br />I had a few technical issues with it:<br /><br />1)I didn't like the way David was introduced to the other lawyers, Finley & Figg. It wasn't explained more than once that he saw the address on the side of the bus, and that's why he landed there from the taxi. Getting that drunk was too extreme and not credible to me. Other reviewers have commented on this.<br /><br />2)What was most difficult to believe was where David suddenly launched into all the research he had done. This research could have been introduced slowly instead of being dumped at the actual trial. At first, he seemed to be winging it at the trial, and then he showed too many specifics not to have really organized and planned his research by memory. I thought he was supposedly busy at the office doing other work, not just gearing up for the trial although some preparation is mentioned, just not that much.<br /><br />3)The women were portrayed like cartoon characters, especially the two women in the courtroom, admittedly an unnatural situation. It just seemed too extreme from a masculine point of view, a bit too chauvinistic and condescending to the women, except for the fashionable female courtroom star and surprisingly, a sex symbol. (The latter part was not believed by this reader.) The women, except for Rochelle, were not well-described. I would have liked to read more about David's wife, who must have been very intelligent, but didn't get enough credit. It wasn't even mentioned that she missed the best part of the trial where David performed at the end.<br /><br />4) What bothered me the absolute most was where David took out his anger on the blogger with impunity. Bloggers (like me) are unpaid, and we believe we are adding something to the world, and don't deserve to be punched out in revenge for any reason (let alone killed as bloggers are in Mexico). Blogging happens to be serious and useful writing. Lofty Harvard-educated David wasn't even punished! That bothered and scared me, actually, that a lawyer got away with it. And how many people actually were influenced by that blog in the story except David? It's unlikely that the mythical blog had many readers, and to take out aggression on a blogger doesn't set a good example for the rule of law in international societies. Worse, it didn't make sense; the blogger actually inspired David to work harder and say something in the defense after reading a bit of criticism, right? I think the action against the blogger in the story was mean, gratuitous, and unhelpful to bloggers in general, a sphere of writing that Grisham appears not to want to help, oddly enough. Maybe the author should take up a bit of blogging to see what it's like, to see how it is for bloggers, as the more wealthy author Danielle Steel has, for example. (But Dan Brown doesn't blog either last time I checked, so he is not the only author who isn't blogging).<br /><br />5)Makes the point that David doesn't carry a gun, but doesn't go into the virtue of gun control enough, and makes a gun seem like a good weapon to have. Bothered and annoyed me a bit that the opportunity to push for weapon-banning didn't happen. Harvard-educated David should have been been more rewarded for not carrying a gun somehow, instead of seeming snobby, weird, nonconforming, unrealistic or unprepared for not having a gun. But sadly, the gun-toters Finley & Figg seemed to be admired and rewarded with saving their own lives by using guns in the story. David's role could have expanded to include and show reasons why guns don'twork in all situations. Now that takes imagination. Otherwise, the wild west rules, and guns appear as the easy way out. I know editors like guns as solutions, but really, why wasn't David shown to be a hero for not carrying a gun instead of seeming wimpy and ineffective in that way?<br /><br />6) David would have been a better example of a nice lawyer by not getting quite as drunk at the beginning, and not punching out the blogger, and still have appeared realistic and credible. He could have had other faults that were a bit less extreme, less violent and alarming to women, like not wanting to wash his clothes or clean the house or something else, like being afraid to fly to describe why he hardly goes anywhere.<br /><br />7)If the reader knows that it isn't anything like a John Galsworthy book as far as having basic command of descriptions of nature, then it's fine. It's such an urban novel. Could have had more country scenes, apart from the warehouse scene with the toy company officials.<br /><br />8)The variety of points of view jumping all around made me go back and check for POV at times.<br /><br />Overall,from the point of view of exciting action, it was a wonderful story. It set up a fine story and delivered. I admired it and enjoyed it. It deserves an enormous readership, and I recommend reading it. Would make a great movie as well. Makes me want to go back and re-read his other novels again.
B000R8YC1S|4.0|KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, Hunter Willow Jones shares her review of this film with us:<br />I love how creative it is!<br />It is the story of Sara (Jennifer Connelly), who is sick of having to watch her infant step-brother, Toby.  She wishes that the goblin king would come and take him away and unbelievably her wish comes true.  The Goblin King, Jareth (David Bowie) arrives at her house and tells her she has thirteen hours to get Toby back, but she has to go through a massive labyrinth.  If she fails to do so, Jareth will keep Toby forever and turn him into a goblin.  Sara regrets her wish.  So she decides she must go through the labyrinth.  Throughout her journey she meets many friends and near death experiences.  She also learns not to take things for granted.<br />I really like how the movie is creative.  I think having puppets as main characters is really cool.  Jim Henson, the creator of Kermit the Frog, wrote, directed and did the puppetry.  I also like the setting a lot.  It goes with the story line and makes the movie feel mystical.  The set has so many cool ideas.  When Sara first comes into the labyrinth, a worm tells her to go through the wall and take a chance.  It looks like there is no way to get through, but when she decides to go through she finds that there are more ways for her to go.  The best part of the movie is the music by David Bowie.  It is cool to use a famous rock star and rock music to create a different mood in the film.<br />The story line could be more creative because the concept istoo close to Alice in Wonderland.<br />Jennifer Connelly's acting is a little weak.  She only uses one facial expression the whole time.  She doesn't show much range to her emotion.<br />I give Labyrinth 4 out of 5 stars and feel that it is better for kids who are eight and over because the puppets can be a little scary for little kids.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, Talia Rashba reviews this film below:<br /><br />This movie is absolutely fantastic!  It is packed with a ton of action and humor and will transport you into an amazing supernatural world where it is all about the good guys fighting the bad.<br /><br />The story is about a group of famous superheroes that come together to defeat the evil Loki, who has stolen a powerful energy cube that he intends to use to take over the world.<br />The superheroes include Iron Man, Captain America, The Hulk, Thor, Black Widow and Hawkeye. Each one has a unique and special supernatural power that they use to help them do their job. At first, the superheroes fight about being a team but eventually they work together to complete the mission. The Avengers could have ended up being a typical superhero movie but it isn't.  Because there are so many heroes, it is much more creative and entertaining.<br /><br />The Avengers is packed with fabulous actors. Robert Downey Jr. plays Tony Stark, also known as Iron Man.  Just like he was in the Iron Man movie, he thinks he is better than everyone else, but luckily, he is really quite funny so you end up liking him a lot. Captain America (Chris Evans) is strong and serious, and he is always ready to get the job done. Actor Mark Ruffalo plays the ferocious green form known as the Incredible Hulk. He really stands out and takes over the scenes he is in. Superhero Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has some of the most incredible battle scenes and Black Widow, portrayed by the beautiful Scarlett Johansen, is the one who convinces the others to put aside their differences and work with each other.<br /><br />An interesting fact is that actor Lou Ferrigno, who has played the Hulk in almost every film since 1978, is actually the Hulk's voice in the movie. Avengers is written and directed by Joss Whedon who does an amazing job.  He makes sure that there is a lot of humor in the movie and that the action scenes really grab your attention.  The special effects were incredible. The super heroes change from their every day selves into their super natural selves in an interesting and fun way. The fight scenes and explosions are unbelievable.  Also, there is a really neat headquarters for the agency that you just have to see for yourself!<br /><br />Even though it is rated PG-13 I think kids ages 11, as well as all adults will love this movie, especially if action is their thing. I am giving this film a 5 out of 5 stars and recommending that you see it right away!e special effects were incredible.

B00000JPH6|3.0|Do you enjoy the puppets used in the classic Muppet films but wish they had a darker story line?  Well look no further that The Dark Crystal.  KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Julianna Noone shares her review of the film below:<br />This is a Jim Henson film that stars Jim Henson as Jen, Kathryn Mullen as Kira and David Goelz as Fizzgig. This movie is about an elf-like gelfling who is sent by his dying master to find a shard from a broken lamp that will help restore the balance in his universe. This gelfling's name is Jen, and Jen  has some troubles along the way. First off, he has the shard but doesn't know what to do with it. Also the skeksis are trying to kill him so that the prophecy can't be fulfilled and the skeksis can live forever. However, Jen gets some help from Kira, the only other gelfling alive, and the animals from the forest, where the witch Kira lives. I think that the puppets they use are very well designed and detailed so much so that they have anthropomorphic qualities. The cinematography is considered to be cutting edge for this movie, but could have been better, as some scenes in the movie you can see the wires on the puppets. My favorite characters are Kira and Fizzgig, Kira's pet. I like Kira because she is brave and determined to protect Jen. I like Fizzgig because he is loyal to Kira and protective of her. Also even when Fizzgig does not want to do something he still does it when Kira asks him to. My favorite scene is when Kira and Jen touch hands and share their memory with one another. I like these scenes because it is kind of the podlings to share their village with a stranger and because I dislike the scenes that are rude and/or cruel. The puppeteering is phenomenal as expected from Jim Henson.  I hope you guys out there enjoy this movie. I think that this film is for ages 8 to 14, because these aren't your normal Jim Henson puppets, and the dark story line may be too much for young children.  Overall, I rate this film 3 out of 5 stars because while it was well done, the darker storyline just isn't for me.ile it was well done, the darker storyline just isn't for me.

0439023521|5.0|Katniss Everdeen volunteers to be District 12's female \\"tribute\\" to the annual Hunger Games because she can't bear to let her little sister, 12-year-old Prim, accept that lottery assigned role. Katniss knows it's a death sentence, because each district must send two tributes to the Games - one boy and one girl - and only one can survive. The tributes will be trained, placed in an arena with unknown conditions (anything from desert to arctic), and left there until they've killed each other off. That is the ongoing punishment the Capitol visits on its once rebellious districts, and as far as Katniss knows no one has ever challenged the Games and their rules in 75 years. Winning means a lifetime of ease for the winner, and a year of Parcels for every citizen of that young person's district. Since people commonly starve to death in District 12, those parcels mean survival. And at first, Katniss doesn't care if she has to kill the male tribute from District 12 along with everyone else who enters the arena. Peeta, the local baker's son, was kind to her once when it made all the difference; and Katniss's reaction to that is hated of indebtedness. She only hopes that her well-honed hunting skills, learned from her dead father and practiced through years of illegally taking game to feed her mother and Prim, will be enough to carry her to victory. Unlikely though that seems, it is all she has...and then things get worse, as she learns that Peeta loves her and she begins to want him to survive, too.<br /><br />This young adult novel is, like so many good ones in that class, entirely readable for adults as well. It's scary enough so I'm glad I could not encounter it while I was an YA reader myself, quite a few years before its publication. Its first person, present tense viewpoint is one I don't usually enjoy, but in this case that viewpoint works because it gives immediacy to Katniss and her situation. One crisis follows another - at times the story moves almost too fast, as both Katniss and the reader struggle to keep up with what the Gamekeepers as well as her fellow contestants are throwing at her. The one thing I find hard to believe is Peeta's sincere and completely self-sacrificing love for Katniss, which doesn't change no matter how she behaves. He seems a bit too saintly, in that respect at least, to stay credible.<br /><br />A real roller coaster ride of an adventure that has a point, as a good YA novel always does. In this case the point (in my estimation) is that people don't know what they are capable of until survival, their own, hangs in the balance. I agree with the reviewer who says that one must accept the author's premise in order to suspend disbelief, and I can understand why that might not work for everyone. But it did work for me.<br /><br />--Reviewed by Nina M.

B008JH5CVS|4.0|I rented Lockout last night via the Amazon Instant Videos, for only $0.99.  What a deal!  I watched in on my Kindle Fire.  I loved it!  As good as [[ASIN:B000SZK41M Die Hard]] or [[ASIN:B00004Y87O Escape from New York]]?  Well no, but then again few films are.  My all time favorite movie is Die Hard, so expecting anything else to be better than that is expecting a bit much. However, I did enjoy this action thriller.  As my title says, I really think having a super good villian on par with Hans Gruber would have greatly helped this film.  The bad guys were okay, but just did not radiate the cool calm evil that Hans did in Die Hard.  As others have posted, sometimes events were a little bit too much, but the action and humor (one liners) made up for that.  Since I rented this movie my time expires later tonight.  I think I will invite my son over and see if he wants to watch it on my big HDTV via the PS3 before my \\"time is up\\".  At $0.99 Amazon almost forced me to rent this movie.  I will buy it in the future, either from Amazon Instant video, if I can catch it for under $5 or just get the DVD sooner or later and then use a program to convert the film to play on my Fire.
0439023491|5.0|The winner of the Hunger Games normally takes a Victory Tour through the districts of Panem, and then settles into a life of ease back home. This time the Games have two winners, because Katniss and Peeta - the girl and boy \\"tributes\\" from District 12 - both survived, thanks to an act of defiance that Katniss conceived in desperation. President Snow is not going to let her get away with it. He cannot strike at her in a public manner, so he chooses more subtle and possibly even more deadly means. First, he forces Katniss to go ahead with marrying Peeta - who genuinely loves her, but whom Katniss isn't at all sure she loves in return. She just may prefer Gale, her long time hunting partner and best friend, and Snow knows that very well. She'd rather not marry anyone, because she does not want to have children and risk seeing the lottery take one of them to die in the arena. Snow knows that, too. But Katniss cannot anticipate what happens when the President announces the terms of the Quarter Quell, a special edition of the Hunger Games that occurs every 25th year. This Quarter Quell, which \\"celebrates\\" 75 years since the rebellion that the Hunger Games punish, will feature contestants drawn from previous Hunger Games winners. Since Katniss is the only female District 12 winner, she knows immediately that she will go back into the arena. Peeta volunteers to go with her, displacing the only other District 12 male winner - their mentor, the middle-aged and drunken Haymitch.<br /><br />This middle book in the Hunger Games trilogy does have some pacing problems, but none that are not due to its being just that: the center installment in a trilogy. Katniss realizes just how dangerous is both her own situation, and that of her loved ones, gradually during the book's first half. Then she and Peeta once again enter the arena - a different arena this time, of course, and they must now face other winners. Some of whom are old, crippled, used up; but all of whom are wily, experienced, and potentially far more dangerous than anyone they battled during their own Hunger Games. Meanwhile, the Capitol is doing its best to keep the citizens of each district ignorant of the beginnings of uprising elsewhere. For Katniss's world, Panem, is catching fire...and President Snow will do whatever it takes to quench that fire.<br /><br />So far President Snow strikes me as a cliche, almost a caricature of evil. The other Capitol District characters, though, get enough fleshing out in this book to earn at least a bit of sympathy from Katniss; and therefore, from readers following her first person, present tense narrative. What happens to Katniss's loved ones is horrifying, and the sense of danger yet to be fulfilled is the most frightening part of this tale. Its ending is, of course, a set-up for the trilogy's concluding installment.<br /><br />--Reviewed by Nina M.

0439023513|5.0|Twice Katniss Everdeen has competed in the Hunger Games and survived, along with her fellow District 12 \\"tribute\\" and would-be husband, Peeta. Although the Hunger Games is supposed to be a fight to the death with only one victor, Katniss has managed to trick the Capitol into allowing two survivors on the first occasion; and in her second time inside the arena, pitted against other winners from earlier Games, she has figured out how to beat the Gamemasters. As a result, she has become the symbol of the revolt that's spreading through all twelve districts. Now she finds herself recuperating from her injuries in supposedly long destroyed District 13, which actually moved itself underground after striking a deal with the Capitol years ago. Gale, her hunting partner and best friend, managed to rescue Katniss's family before the Capitol bombed District 12 out of existence; but having them safe, Gale and her mother and her little sister Prim, isn't enough to comfort Katniss. She cannot reconcile herself to being the person the rebellion wants her to be. The Mockingjay, in human form.<br /><br />This concluding installment in the Hunger Games trilogy includes more introspection by narrator Katniss than the previous books, but it still has plenty of action and doesn't often lag. The reader goes with Katniss through a painful and at times terrifying journey of self-discovery, and watches her grow up and learn to accept the parts of herself she doesn't particularly like - but needs. The only difficulty I found came at the end, when I could not quite accept a plot twist which is crucial to the story's resolution.<br /><br />--Reviewed by Nina M.

0307352145|4.0|Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking<br /><br />By: Susan Cain<br /><br />So I am a pretty introverted person. Yep, I even took the test (16/20 true), just to be sure ;) and I have to say, I loved this book. It strikes me as odd that people are so obsessed with being extroverted. It boggles my mind most of the time.  The amount of time, money and energy that people poor into making themselves and the people around them \\"extroverted\\" is a concept I simply do not agree with. Now I am not saying we should all live in a little shell as if we are a monk residing in an our own personal abbey, but seriously, to me, there is such a thing as being over extraverted.<br /><br />While reading Mrs. Cain's book I could not help but think our society was better off when our values were emphasized on the \\"old\\" attributes like: citizenship, duty, work, golden deeds, honor, reputation, morals, manners and integrity, than they have become with our \\"new\\"  attributes of focusing on the self  and being an enigma to others. We took great quality characteristics and replaced them with shallow, self serving, all about me characteristics. All I can say to that is I miss the old days and strive to bring my kids up by those characteristic and not our newfound ones that have people so jazzed up.<br /><br /> I loved the quote from Woodbury's 1922 soap Ad \\"All around you, people are judging you silently\\" and \\"critical eyes are sizing you up right now!\\" There is such an amazing amount of truth in those statements even today. Yet, our culture loves to be talked about. The more outlandish you are the more attention you get. It's like we live in a world where the more idiotic you appear, the greater your chance of success in life.  I read the story of Tony Robbins, but I am skeptical of people that jump around and use closed ended statement s to get you to agree with them or their product they are pushing.  It is so clich&eacute; and laughable. It is said imitation is the highest form of praise, but I value uniqueness in an individual.  I don't like people that go around and only regurgitate someone else's opinion or idea about life. Have your own insight and creativity. Be your own man/woman. Stand up on your own coattails. I instantly distrust people who are hoping around, going crazy and running around like a fool who just did a line of coke. I am not impartial either to this. The sales man, the motivational speakers or the preacher. I show no bias. There is something distrust worthy to me about someone who has to put on such a show for his or her audience to buy into what they are selling. I am not saying I want them to stand in front the mike, flat faced with no external emotion, but there is a middle ground to be had and that is where I personally like to see things at. Everyone loves the charismatic leader that draws everyone's attention and speaks just for them alone, but I prefer to rely on body language to see if someone buys into their product or self.<br /><br />The section on \\"When Collaboration Kills Creativity\\" was amazing and insightful.  There is a struggle with both the introvert and the extrovert with group work. Each person has important information and creativity that they can bring into a group situation that would otherwise be lacking.  This section really gave me something to sit back and contemplate. It was worth re-reading to me, especially since I work with a VERY extroverted boss.<br /><br />My favorite chapter's though had to be the ones on communicating with people of opposite type as you and \\"How to Cultivate Quiet Kids in a World That Can't Hear Them. \\" These two topics really fascinated me simply because I have one introverted child and 2 major extroverted children and it seems we do have difficulty communicating with each other. I LOVED Carl Jung's quote: The meeting of 2 personalities is like the contact of 2 chemical substances; if there is any reaction, both are transformed.\\" I could not say it any better myself! I tend to think that my kids and I complement each other in different level and help make up for each other's \\"lacking\\" qualities.  I also, adored the role-playing aspect of this chapter. I have done this with my own children to get them to understand how their words and actions appear to others despite what they are trying to say/convey. It's a standard technique that marriage counselors use themselves to this day and it is enlightening to say the least.<br /><br />I greatly enjoyed this book .I learned so much from it that I know I can apply and take with me when dealing with not only my family, but my friends, co-workers and strangers alike. Although I have to say I don't really enjoy the cover very much and as such thought the book was going to be a very dry read. I am glad I was wrong.

B004JN1D2I|3.0|The first book of the series, \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is excellent.  The story line is intriguing and I found it hard to put down.  Unfortunately, the remaining three books (three very long books) turn into a tedious affair.  To begin, we have Martin's fixation with describing every article of clothing the characters are wearing in every sceen in exhaustive detail (not to mention the plethora of sigils worn that represent various houses).  Then, we have the fact that Martin is really telling at least three maint storylines (the Night's Watch, Daenerys, and the war in Westeros).  We're 4 books into the planned 7 series and there is only the faintest links at this point between the three.  Additionally, Martin has multiple threads being told at the same time, with the result being that you'll finish a chapter focused on one person and not return to them until 5 or more chapters later in the book.  By then, you've forgotten what the heck they were doing and why you're supposed to care.  Martin introduces new characters at will, making it nearly impossible to keep track of who is actually important, who is involved in what, and who is allied with who.  This even get t othe point where he decides to resurrect characters that were killed earlier.  While I enjoy plot twists, Martin puts in so many, with such frequency and seemlys so haphazardly that I'm coming to believe that there really is no plot.  We're just following along a Medieval fantasy version of Richard Linklater's \\"Slacker\\" as the camera jumps from one character to another.
B00479SVBU|5.0|this is a great product.  It's the third one i buy and I'm very happy with it.  Maybe the remote control could be better.

0345803485|1.0|They've said it before and I'll say it again, its the rated R version of Twilight. And by that it means, its characters, its plot are nothing original. The only thing that makes it different from Twilight is its all about sex. From cover to cover. It would have been a unique book had the author been original enough to NOT make the characters ALMOST identical to ALL OF THE CHARACTERS OF TWILIGHT. I mean c'mon. Even the plot where the Ana visits her mom in a very warm state much like when Bella visited her mom on another warm state. Sure Christian is rich, handsome and again, RICH. But beyond that, I wouldn't want to fantasize a man who is very controlling. But then again, I am not aware of BDSM relationships. I'd rather stick with a vampire. (lol). At least that guy knows self control and wouldn't \\"trick\\" nor \\"intentionally\\" harm her girl. I could go on and on but I just can't seem to bring myself the trouble of doing it. Bottom line is, its going off on ebay bec I feel like I've wasted money on something not original.<br /><br />BY THE WAY, haven't the author thought of at least the word TEXTING instead of the characters emailing back and forth?!? ALSO, who else would use the MEDULLA OBLONGATA when you're referring to your sub conscious mind? I MEAN, C'MOOOOOOOOOOOONNN?!?!!!!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey's self-plublished series of 5 interlocked stories about life in a destroyed and desolate future are as entertaining and heart-pounding as you could want.  A couple of years ago there was a lot of buzz and fervor for Justin Cronin's THE PASSAGE, and reading WOOL with anticipation and readerly joy made me wonder how does buzz start?  Because WOOL deserves that buzz.  It is highly readable and full of shocking twists and turns.  And it takes place in a fully imagined and realized world that is rife with detail and intrigue, and it was, up to and including its last page, able to constantly surprise me, which is no mean feat.  Do I take slight issue with a couple of narrative shortcuts to get story out through characters who seem connected only to get that information out?  Sure.  But that issue is very slight.  As speculative fiction goes, WOOL is at the top of the heap - and I would suggest that label is just too limiting for this very enjoyable story (for the 5 books really are just one big tale).  This is just good fiction, period.  Highly recommended.

B006DRVFRQ|3.0|This app works great on my Kindle Fire, but after using it since December I found that my &quot;internal storage&quot; was completely full. I had my Fire purge all data for this program but when connected to my PC over USB I found that there was still 5GB being used! I would give it 5 stars for features and functions, but seeing how I had to manually purge it's data store I had to rate it down.

0345803485|1.0|Holy Cow and Geez?  What a flippin' joke this is.  Not only is it a joke it is a put down on young women.  Because a guy is good looking and rich, you would drop your drawers for him?  The young women of the PNW have more brains that that. I HATED THE 50 PAGES I COULD BARELY READ!!
B007K3JCAE|1.0|This is a great movie.  But I will NEVER buy a product that only offers an ultraviolet digital copy.  In fact, I have stopped purchasing bluray packages that offer the ultraviolet copy.  It is a limited right to use and only if you can access their cloud; it is not a digital copy you can take with you.  Worthless!  I will go for the regular DVD copy and unfortunately will have to give up any hope of having a real digital copy of this flick.

1400052181|5.0|\\"Henrietta Lacks\\" is one of the best books I've read in a long time. It tells the story of the famous \\"HeLa\\" cells, removed from an African-American women with virulent cervical cancer, that proved to be so hardy that they were the first to be reproduced in a lab. But this is most decidedly not a scientific treatise. This is the story of a black family in the 1950's in Baltimore on the eve of desegration. It's the story of a medical establishment that rode roughshod over them in the name of science. It's a story about race, culture and ethics.<br /><br />Skloot became fascinated with the \\"HeLa\\" cells in high school and spent years researching their story. What she tells here, though, is really the story of Henrietta's family as they struggle to reconcile the loss of a mother with the crazy tales they are told about what their mother's cells mean to science. Along the way, we read of numerous examples of medical experiments conducted without patients' knowledge or understanding, much less consent, exposing many of them to serious harm. What's more, these patients were most often the most disadvantaged members of society--poor, black, institutionalized or infirm. The details Skloot provides are truly shocking. At the end of the book Skloot provides a well-written, very clear summary of where the issues of medical experimentation stand today, and it's not what I thought at all. Beware!<br /><br />Rebecca Skloot has mastered the art of writing non-fiction that reads like a novel. The only thing I've read that's as good as this in this genre is \\"Warmth of other Suns.\\" [[ASIN:0679763880 The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America's Great Migration]] One other recent example of this genre that did not come up to the mark was \\"In the Garden of Beasts.\\"  [[ASIN:030740885X In the Garden of Beasts: Love, Terror, and an American Family in Hitler's Berlin]]. It's a rare skill, and Skloot has it.

0765365278|5.0|This is one of the best fantasy novels that I've read in a long time.  The pace is decent, the characters are well done, and the world setting is quite unlike any I've come across, while being familiar enough not to seem too strange. The world is shaped by extremely powerful storms and this is reflected not only in the events, but in the dialogue and verbage used by the characters.  The story consists of a few main threads (one involves some flashbacks), and a couple of minor threads, with some extra parts that are seemingly unrelated, but will be incorporated eventually (not this book) or reveal more about the world. The historical elements flesh out the world more, as well as adding to the story. The book doesn't always switch storylines at each \\"cliff hanger,\\" and this is nice, it removes predictablility. When it does, I really wanted it not to, but I was soon engrossed in the other thread.
B000YJ54DU|5.0|I love all the Jack Reacher book series.  The characters are never boring and always exciting and interesting.  It is nice to pretend there is someone as amazing, calculating, and ethical as Jack out there in the world helping people and righting wrongs.
B007TR1R22|1.0|\\"Where were the sharks?\\" I was lead to believe that \\"The Deep Blue Sea\\" was a thrilling science fiction film about smart sharks killing people. You see, my friends kept referencing a certain scene involving Samuel L. Jackson being eaten by said shark so many times that I decided to purchase the film to see what the fuss was about. So the day came and \\"The Deep Blue Sea\\" finally arrived. I was excited, like kid on Christmas morning excited. After tearing through the packaging, I popped the DVD into my Xbox 360 and gave it my full attention. What I watched was no shark story, but a love story. It was great and all, but there weren't any sharks. No action. No Samuel L. Jackson. My friends had deceived me. But they have deceived me for the last time. This I can guarantee you.....

Dexter was a week whiney pathetic excuse for a man and rachael is an absolutely awful friend.

1586217194|4.0|An exploration of what our brain does without us knowing we are doing it. Those fast decisions that help us cross the road when a car is coming up faster than you expected, and you dash out of the way before you know you are doing it. How do we make these decisions and can we control or do we want to control these fast judgements we make. Also looks at micro expressions that we perceive but don't know we see because of the speed at which they happen.<br /><br />I enjoyed listening to this book, it was read by the author which was enjoyable. The author is very sure of himself and all of the concepts he presents which can at times get a bit old. Some of the book wasn't as engaging as other parts but I liked the opening where snap judgments and science were compared. I'm sure there are also examples that can go the other way where science was better than intuition. I think what I liked most was the part of the book that talked about micro expressions and the expressions we make and how they communicate more to us than what is said. We learn these expressions before we learn to talk they are vital to our communication with others as well as the way we feel about others after we meet them. This is a book I would recommend but not to everyone. There are some people that will really dislike this book because of the discussion about thinking without knowing we are doing it. Those that need to be in charge every moment will not enjoy this book as it is letting the subconscious take over for a while. However, we may be able to use snap decisions and judgments to our advantage with some amount of practice at which point we may be in control of them more than we would know.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|I found this book enjoyable to read. The insight it gives into the range of human emotion and experience in one of the most difficult jobs in the world is fascinating. If one is interested in Amercan history it is certainly appealing and for many it will be of nostalgic value too; but even with little knowledge of events, there is plenty to absorb about these famous characters who have influenced so many lives. There were short parts that I (as a non-American) found  a little laboured, but I had anticipated that in a book written by Americans about prominent Americans. This book has stimulated me to read further by providing perspectives that are not easily gleaned from purely factual sources. If one is even vaguely interested in American politics, or interested in the qualities of those who aspire to high leadership anywhere, I would strongly recommend it.
0307887448|5.0|Ernest Cline delivers in a big way with Ready Player One.  It's a book that I believe geeks and non-geeks can enjoy.  It's a fun and fanastic adventure filled with pop culture references, social commentary and a tales of love and friendship that anyone can relate to.  I read a lot of sci-fi and I think this and Wool by Hugh Howey are the top two I've read so far this year.

031620157X|4.0|So THE WISHING SPELL has officially became my favorite fairy tale re-imagining book. No joke.<br /><br />I will admit, though, that the beginning was very slow. But as soon as they landed in the Land of Stories, the story just sky rocketed. Lots of action scenes can be found in THE WISHING SPELL. But the best part?  Every chapter has a meaning in the story and teaches a lesson to the reader. That's what really makes this story whole.<br /><br />And Chris Colfer is definitely different than other celebrities who have written books. His writing style is very interesting, and he has crafted together a wonderful story that I would go back and re-read any day.<br /><br />I absolutely loved the Land of Stories. In this world, the fairy tale characters that we have come to love (Cinderella, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, etc.) have continued their journey after the \\"Happily Ever After\\" in fairy tales. Cinderella is an expecting mother; Sleeping Beauty has finally been awoken and is trying to get her kingdom in order; all the other fairy tales characters have continued their journey that Alex and Connor get to be apart of.<br /><br />Each character in THE WISHING SPELL has complexity to do beyond belief. Colfer put hard work into their back stories so the reader understands the characters. And each kingdom is purely awesome in this world. I loved it when the twins traveled to each different kingdom.<br /><br />And there was so many twists at the end! But it's not overwhelming (to me at least). Chris Colfer hints about so many things in the beginning, and at the end, I was like: \\"HOW DID I NOT CATCH THAT.\\"<br /><br />Overall, Chris Colfer's debut novel is one not to be missed. I highly recommend it if you're a fairy-tale fanatic!

I've already seen this 5 times, with many more to come.
B008ASLK8A|1.0|Good acting by Downey, Law and others, but terrible direction and storyline. I found it confusing and almost painful to watch the entire film. I'm sorry I did because I would have spent my time better sleeping. Even the 99 cent deal was too much! Free would be too much.
B005LAIH9A|5.0|The film while cliche on many points and seems to find itself wonder how do we entertain our older viewers that were around for the first one, but get new viewers. Honestly, you can't really do both. That is the one glaring flaw of the film. I did enjoy the film for its jokes, embarrassing situations, and well insanity. Oh and lets not forget the return of Stiffler and Jim's Dad. If you loved the original three movies you will like this one for certain.

0061673730|4.0|I have always had an interest in philosophy.  When I heard about this book, I was not interested, but when I started reading, I couldn't put it down.  It handles the complex topics very well and the author makes it very accessable to all readers.  At the same time, the author creates characters that you actually care about.<br /><br />There are parts of the book that can get a little dense and it slows down a little in the middle, but if you have any interst in philosphy, I belive you will enjoy this read.<br /><br />This is obvously not a textbook and it is by no means an exhaustive study on quality, but it is a great way to learn a little bit of philsophy in a fun and enjoyable way.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|English heavy metal legends Iron Maiden released their twelfth studio album entitled Brave New World in May of 2000.<br />Prior to Brave New World, Iron Maiden had a dismal end to the 1990s (a bad decade for metal thanks to grunge and alternative sending hard rock and metal underground) as the band released (I must confess) their two worst albums out of 1995's X Factor and 1998's Virtual XI with singer Blaze Bayley (whom I didn't like). Then after the failure of Virtual XI, Bayley got fired from Iron Maiden and both guitarist Adrian Smith and well known lead singer Bruce Dickinson (whom were key members in the classic 1982-89 Iron Maiden period) had returned to the band. Therefore, Iron Maiden expanded from a five piece to a six piece which now consisted of Iron Maiden's classic lineup (Smith, Dickinson, co-founder/bass player Steve Harris, guitarist Dave Murray (the only other member aside Harris to appear on every Maiden album) and drummer Nicko McBrain) plus guitarist Janick Gers (whom was Smith's replacement) stayed to add a three guitar assault.<br />Next, the band signed a deal with Portrait (a subsidiary of Columbia Records (owned by Sony)) here in the US (while staying with EMI elsewhere), did the Ed Hunter Tour to re-establish themselves and entered the studio in France with co-producer/engineer Kevin Shirley (famed for his work with Rush, Journey, The Black Crowes and the live reissues of Led Zeppelin's work) to work on the first Iron Maiden album with Dickinson since 1992's Fear of the Dark and Smith's first since 1988's brilliant Seventh Son Of a Seventh Son. As a result, I had high expectations for Brave New World.<br />So when I bought the Brave New World CD on street date on my way to college graduation rehearsal in May of 2000, I listened to this disc with great expectations and Brave New World lived up to expectations and then some.<br />We open with the rocker \\"The Wickerman\\" penned by Smith/Dickinson/Harris and this song just blew my eardrums off and is a kick*ss tune. Next is the Gers/Harris/Dickinson penned \\"Ghost of the Navigator\\" which was another winner out of the ballpark. The title track is next and is a great piece penned by Harris/Dickinson/Murray. The Harris penned \\"Blood Brothers\\" follows and is another great track. Next is the Harris/Gers penned \\"The Mercenary\\" which is another great rocking tune.<br />The second half starts with the Gers/Harris epic \\"Dream of Mirrors\\" and this song is just a great song altogether. Next is the Smith/Harris collaboration \\"The Fallen Angel\\" which is another winner. Next is another nine plus minute epic out of the Harris/Murray penned \\"The Nomad\\" which just rocks. Then we follow with the Harris/Gers/Dickinson collaboration \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" which is another winner. We then close with the eight and a half minute Harris/Murray collaboration epic \\"Thin Line Between Love and Hate\\" which ends the album on an epic note.<br />The Brave New World album proved that Iron Maiden was back and they sure as Hell meant business. It debuted at #39 on the Billboard 200 which was their highest position since (the final album with Dickinson until his 1999 return) Fear of the Dark peaked at #12 eight years earlier but the band has continued to outdo itself with the last few studio albums since (Dance of Death in 2003 would hit the Top 20, 2006's A Matter of Life and Death hit the US Top 10 (first Maiden album to do this) and 2010's masterpiece The Final Frontier would crack the US Top 5).<br />In fact, I saw Iron Maiden on the tour in support of Brave New World at what was then known as the Tweeter Center outside Boston and they played six of the album's ten tracks and it was one Hell of a show.<br />HUGELY RECOMMENDED!and is a kick*ss tune.

B00368CQ8C|5.0|My son loves this crane. It has a magnet so it will lift any accessory with a magnet on it. It's on wheels so it easily moves around the track, however, that's not always fun for my son because it moves easily. Good quality and the trains it comes with are fun as well.
0385333846|2.0|\\"This one is a failure...\\"  Not my words.  Vonnegut himself wrote that in the book's into to describe this book.  I think Vonnegut was aware of the fact that this book sucked and made no secret of it... the joke is that people persist in praising it in spite of the fact that it sucks.<br /><br />I had this book on my reading list for a long time.  However, I always chose something else because the critical acclaim for this novel made me nervous.  Do you want a good recipe?  Here it goes.  Critical acclaim = suck 90% of the time.<br /><br />The more the academics and book snobs love it, the more certain you can be that it sucks.<br /><br />Now... Now... Now... I can see you waiving your pinky in the air and yelling that this is a \\"deep\\" book and the message is this or the message is that.  This represents that or this thing represents that thing.  Yeah, I get all that.  But the beauty of it is that I don't care.<br /><br />I don't care.<br /><br />I found the constant use of the phrase \\"so it goes\\" to be particularly poor.  Yeah... yeah... yeah... Vonnegut uses the phrase very time someone dies or there is some sort of reference to death.  Ohhhhhhh... so deep, right?  What masterful thinking, right?<br /><br />Sorry.  No.  It's just dumb.  I've got an idea, how about I write a book and use the phrase \\"so it goes\\" every time the main character takes a dump.  Would that be just as deep and enlightening?  Then some fool literary critic years from now will praise my book as a juxtaposition of the meaningless nature of crapping with the meaningless nature of war.  Perhaps I will win some awards for my work and for my gritty brilliance.<br /><br />Wait a minute... wait just a minute here.... Hey - there is a part in Slaughterhouse 5 when the main character finds his son sitting on a toilet!  Oh my gosh!!!  I think I just unlocked the true meaning of this book!  War is crap!  I'm so smart that I just come up with brilliant analysis at random that takes others a lifetime ofstudy!  Oh... and then there is that part about the latrine at the prison camp!  Of course... of course... I see it all now!!!  And then there is that other part about the excrement being emptied out in buckets from the train... the main character even spends some time with the turd bucket!<br /><br />I figured it out!  I've unlocked the secret of Slaughterhouse 5!  To commemorate this occasion, I hereby write a masterful poem for posterity.  I call it \\"Ode to the Time I Read Slaughterhouse 5\\"<br /><br />I read Slaughterhouse 5<br /><br />The Bee Gees sang Stayin' Alive<br />They made Billy shovel poop out of a train<br />In my arm I can see a blue vein<br />Billy went back and forth in time<br />Hey give me my pencil back, it's mine<br />Billy's son plays guitar on the toilet<br />If my engine gets stuck I oil it<br /><br />You may print that poem out and share its awesomeness with your friends and family.<br />It is a 1st edition all-time classic.  Perhaps even write it on your Christmas cards this year.<br /><br />Still, I give the book 2 stars.

B002FGU45I|4.0|I bought these for my husband for a recent vacation. We both loves the Teva sandals and my husband wore his last pair out believe it or not.  They are so comfortable and usually required no breaking in however this last pair gave him a blister. He normally wears a slip on sandal without a back so I kinda think because he has basically been without shoes this summer other than slides may just be the reason. As of a week later...comfort all around! A great sandal for comfort as well as casual style.

1596912375|5.0|Unlike many of the current genre of \\"Spy Trillers\\", as one of the other commenters stated, this has the feel of a Graham Greene or John LeCarre. And unlike the most negative commentor, nothing is perfect, including opinions concerning the editing and length of a book. As one who favors more editing rather than less usually, my determination is that the editing is fine. I don't detect much \\"filler\\".  What is particularly unique about this book, is that the main characters are both females, a mother and daughter. Most of us, myself included, think of the intellegence business a a male profession. Hopefully, my view that women are the more compasionate and thoughtful regarding their lives, the story is primarily about what happens to those who do their duty, and have to live with it, the rest of their lives. As a combat pilot in Viet Nam, I willl live with my actions, loss of comrades, and the innocents I may have killed the rest of my life. Its akin to Post Traumatic Syndome, a word I did not know existed until recently. People who engage in activities that require dedication and in particular, human activities outside the norm represent a minority of the population.  I think the author touches on the subject of life after that period outside the normal existence, and living, or attempting to live a normal life. In this novel, which is placed inside the real historical world of events, most of the public is not aware, the author has written both a history of the individual being there.<br /><br />My only exception to the authors definition of why someone would turn into a \\"spy\\" misses that some \\"traitors\\" do it for motives that are intellectual. They live in a society or political system that does not appeal to them, and see another system as better, better for the common man.<br /><br />There also is a general misconception about the difference between a spy, such as Kim Philby,Burgess and McLean. They were Britians working for a system, Communism, they believed wasbetter than there own British system. The heroine is this books an \\"Agent\\" of her country. Spies and Agents operate in much the same way. Their tools are deception, and this is where the professionals in this trade are most suseptable as humans after their roles in that profession are no longer needed. Ordinary policemen have difficulty adjusting to life after they retire. In addition to the common negative effects of retirement that nearly all feel, this is particularly difficult to those who lived lives that gave them the sanctioned power of life and death. Pulling a trigger or droping a bomb in defense of your country is not a \\"normal\\" human occupation. Life after that duty is a subject the author  has skillfully written.

0887081770|1.0|So, I got this book in the mail and put it on the shelf.  When it was time to read it, we started reading and then came to several pages that were upside down and our book had missing pages!  The book itself looks very cool with all of the fold-out pages, but it's worthless to us when the missing pages make the story senseless!
B007IXWKUK|2.0|This is a ok book. It's a standard romance book with a  lot of sex . The  second and third book was very disappointing . I would not recommend these books. VERY BORING BOOKWORM13
B008IJTFYW|5.0|What a great app! Very easy to use and the sound selection is wonderful. Being able to layer the sounds, control the volume and set the duration of the app is terrific. Well done!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Its fine. Nothing spectacular but passes the time. My nieces like it tho, so seems to be geared more to kids.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love the movies,  love the game!!!!! Keep the village growing. The colors and graphics are very good. Let us watch some of the movies in the game.
B003XRELEI|4.0|The satire in this book is so sharp and so true, it is really incredible how effortless the writing appears. It says a lot about a book and the way the author saw the world, when you can pick it up almost 40 years after it was written and still relate to most of the material as if it were written yesterday.<br /><br />Breakfast of Champions is precisely that type of book. Both hilarious and morose because it's true, Vonegut's masterpiece is a little too down-to-Earth for comfort, as he shamelessly insults the American (and Earthly) way of life.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|no scratches jus a smear but I love it . no skips and I watch it all the time. ready to purchase more movies.

1582701709|1.0|In Plato's \\"Republic\\" Socrates urges caution on the nature of sophists - itinerant and deceptive frauds posing as legitimate educators - and implores his listeners to be skeptical and rational in the face of hucksterism. Philosophy by its truest definition can best be summarized as a system of shared knowledge. Rhonda Byrne's mendacious \\"The Secret\\" works on one basic contingent: your wallet. It is prefaced with the most erroneous claim that the greatest individuals throughout history (Plato, Newton, Darwin, etc) \\"secretly\\" - there's that word again - embodied this philosophy, which the unfortunate and hapless reader is coaxed in to believing over its terse 170 pages. It is the kind of unsustainable philosophy endemic of a time when pseudo-scientists would have us believe that the cosmos is aligned with human beings and alchemy is chemistry. Despite how overwhelmingly preposterous and commerce-minded The Secret is, it has nevertheless flourished, because of its readership's perennial curiosity with spirituality and their \\"place\\" in the universe. There is nothing wrong with asking the big questions on life and who we are, but there is something grotesque when you consider that these basic human inquiries are reduced to televangelist style fundraising for a very elite few. One can find all the probing moral and spiritual questions in the works of people like Kant, Darwin, Hume, Locke, and Epicurus. Those individuals devoted their entire lives to the big questions of existentialism, metaphysics, nature, and science; this book is not so high-minded. Even if you remove the monetary motives, the core philosophy is still utterly ludicrous. Essentially it's this: if you sincerely want something, and \\"put it out there\\", then you'll get it, but if your desires don't manifest, then through no fault of the method it is your own. This is classical circular reasoning. At the very point of its conception it has its own built-in fail safe clause, which guarantees the philosophy, but cannot guarantee the person using it. Equally confusing as its ideology is its financial success. And therein lies, excuse the pun, \\"The Secret\\". Because it is so terse in philosophical specificity, but so broad in its aims, it seeks to bring its readership into the manifold through suspension of critical thinking and recruitment of logical fallacies. It is breathtakingly irresponsible and stupid. This book is not the result of a considered philosophy, but a flavorless by-product of committee thinking. The Emperor is without clothes.

1451626657|5.0|I consider Catch 22 to be the greatest American novel ever written. And thanks to Amazon it's cheaper to buy online than at a book store. Everyone should read Catch 22, some may not like it because it is very sarcastic and absurdist, postmodern in that sense so it may not appeal to everyone, but I found it original, hilarious and very intriguing.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I love this program.  Connects great with all my documents in Google.  I would recommend this program.  I use it all the time.
B0008ENHUI|5.0|This really is an underrated movie i think, the acting is pretty good and it's a very interesting story, actually very deep. I enjoyed it very much, shipping was pretty quick.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|I've been reading a lot of endurance sports related material lately and this one really stands out.<br /><br />Well written and it seems to give a really genuine impression of Scott and his accomplishments. The book provides plenty of detail and insight without so much fluff or repetition that I've found elsewhere.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B007STBUIW|5.0|This is an excellent example of a great movie which will be enjoyed generation after generation. Universal has spend a great amount of money and time, to ensure that picture perfect for Blue Ray release. The theme music is also one of the greatest movie sound track.<br />Storyline is simple and clear with great acting from all the leads. It is far better from CGI images as compared with modern movies making as all the stuff are real. It deserves a place in all movies lover's home again with this Blue Ray release.
B000003TAL|5.0|These days, people who know me know that I can never shut up about how amazing this band is and how amazing this album is. But I did not always feel this way.  For a long time, I never understood what the hype was about Sonic Youth. I suspect that at the time, my musical senses were not attuned to their dissonant, noisy guitars. But I had always listened to music with plenty of strange sounds so I knew that couldn't be it. Whatever it was, Sonic Youth simply bored me. I had given a few songs of theirs a try and it wasn't working.  Then, one day, I listened to Teenage Riot. I thought, &#34;Wow, what an AMAZING song. If only they could always sound like that&#34;. I listened to that song on repeat forever. Then I downloaded &#34;The Sprawl&#34; and thought &#34;Wow, if only the rest could sound like that too&#34;.  Over the course of the year, I slowly downloaded more songs until I realized I should probably stop half-listening to this album and actually give the whole damn thing a shot. At first, the noise was disconcerting and even frustrating. Sometimes, I saw the noise freakouts as unnecessary. But I was realizing quite quickly that all I was listening to was this album. The days turned to weeks and into months. My life was consumed by Daydream Nation.  Eventually, it became clear to me that Daydream Nation was a masterpiece. Its ferocious attack is unrelenting. Sonic Youth are masters at creating an explosive chaos underneath the structure of a pop song. The songs on this album are catchy and accessible even if it sounds like the guitars are at war with each other. It is, quite simply, one of the greatest records you'll ever hear. It took me a long time to finally come around. But I finally did, and I'm super grateful for it. It's been a blast.
B003HZW26U|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend.  I love animals so I thought, \\"I'll give it a try.\\"  I was not disappointed.  This book had me laughing crying and angry.  But the ending was amazing, showing the circle of life and how all things come together for one great purpose.  Enzo is an amazing dog and the writing style is so unique.  Would love to see this one made into a movie.
B005K17RU0|5.0|thankful for an app that will give me ten days forecast.  would recommend it to anyone wanting to plan ahead
B004WWC9EC|3.0|I am a huge fan of Dan Brown. I love his writing style and his short chapters... it's easy to say \\"I'll read just one more chapter then get back to work.\\"  Before you know it you've finished the entire book.  Dan Brown has a way of grabbing the readers attention in the first chapter.  This book, while the story was good and the writing excellent, was not his best in my opinion.  I felt it was just a little predictable.  But overall an enjoyable read.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|the beginning was OK...but when I went deeper I just couldn't understand...how can a girl be so stupid in this century to take orders...literally every command is taken...what to eat, how sleep and even how to have sex and to top it of the spanking. the girl character is such a make belief. who in their right minds lets a man do that to herself after being so EDUCATED!!<br />THIS SO FAR HAS BEEN THE WORST AND THE MOST PATHETIC BOOK I HAVE READ AND TORTURED MYSELF WITH!!!<br /><br />Wont even think about reading the next book....
0385512104|3.0|This book was recommended to me. I bought it and it sat on the shelf for a year before I picked it up and started to read it.  I just wasn't sure I could get into it. It is a fairly short book,so I finished it quickly.  It was entertaining and heartwarming and educational.  Written from a unique perspective.
B0028R765A|4.0|This film is the next best thing. Although it doesn't capture all of the graphic novel in its entirety - how could it? - it does a great job with those bits that it does. The ending has been changed somewhat, but I thought this had been done in a way that was actually a bit better than the graphic novel in parts (the disaster at the end of the graphic novel does come off as a bit absurd), although Dr Manhattan's decision at the end is ultimately not satisfying(as life often is not )!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|a lot of fun easy too play a lot of fun for all ages just point and touch pretty addicting
B003UESJEM|5.0|This movie gets into many of the aspects of corporate downsizing, mergers and etc. It's really all part of globalization and how it affects workers and even management. Ben Affleck's character is someone in management who is terminated after having worked a number of years for the company. The movie shows how his life is affected as a result. I have had the experience myself and can really relate to the character he portrays in the film.<br /><br />The film covers the effect of the downsizing on the lives of other characters in the film as well. The end of the movie is quite positive and I recommend it for that reason. It can be somewhat inspiring to those who may be going through the experience themselves. Especially, these days with the economy the way it is.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|lots of sound choices, works nice. turned it on and it ran for two hrs without challenge. even allowed my kindle to.&quot;sleep&quot; to save battery. recommend!

0307730697|5.0|Wow! This is a hard book to review, and to read.  It's an emotional rollercoaster ride that will have you laughing, cheering, and sobbing your eyes out. It is an incredible story, and lesson in, - Never give up. \\"FEARLESS,\\" is the story of Adam Brown, small town Arkansas boy , devout Christian, and family man. The story follows him from childhood to adulthood, documenting the unbelievable obstacles he overcame, to not only become an elite SEAL Team 6 member, but an remarkable human being. The story is not focused on the war, although it does play a major part in Adam's story. \\"FEARLESS,\\" is about Adam's struggles to succeed, to become the best of the best. It's about overcoming  drug addiction, the loss of an eye, and having all his finger's severed and sewn back on and the incredible love he had for his wife and children. If Adam's story had been told as fiction, it would be unbelievable, but the reality of it, is awe-inspiring.  I didn't believe men like Adam still existed.<br />Adam's story is also incredibly tragic. If you're brave enough to read it, and beware, it's tough to read, but certainly worth it; it will change you somehow.  Be sure to have a box of tissues for the end, because it is an emotional heartbreaker, and leaves you with an age old question. WHY! Why someone like Adam?<br />Adam's wife Kelley, the author, and the members of Adams brotherhood, many of whom were themselves lost soon after their interviews, have honored Adam well. It was an honor and a privilege to read Adam's story. It's a story I won't be forgetting anytime soon.
B005FISBTO|3.0|Some spoilers!<br /><br />I really love Dexter and, like many other reviewers, have been a fan since the first season.  I think that seasons 1-5 are all rated 5-stars and that the entire cast is great, especially MC Hall, who displays some of the most intense acting chops of any actor, ever.  The writing of the previous 5 seasons has painted a vivid picture of Dexter and his fellow characters, and we know them well.  The various antagonists have always been written brilliantly and the actors chosen have been outstanding in their roles (I'm talking to you, Trinity!).<br /><br />I didn't feel quite as strongly in love with Season 6.  While I agree that the show's regular cast members maintained their 10-star acting performances (J Carpenter!!), and I loved the Brother Sam storyline and Quinn's meltdown, I thought that there were two problems with this season:<br /><br />1. Writing quality.  What the HECK was this season about, really?  Was it about Dexter and God?  Dexter and the Doomsday Killer?  Dexter trying to exorcise everyone of their Dark Passengers, like some quixotic archangel?  Dexter going crazy (hello, Rudy, I missed you)?  Dexter skipping work and being too busy to spend time with his son?  Dexter the Amateur, making mistakes left and right (having poison gas reaction, still attempt to get bad guy -or- oops, someone took my son!)?  Why was Dex sometimes written as a bit of an airhead, instead of being focused and precise?  Was it an attempt to show his personal battle of Good v Evil?  If so, I had too many \\"wait, what?\\" moments (random Midwest bathroom sex with a stranger) to fully appreciate that particular storyline.<br /><br />And the most creepy and eyeroll-inducing aspect of the season... Deb tacitly being given permission to be in love with Dexter, regardless of their lifelong brother/sister relationship, by her one-note shrink.  Ugh.  I hope that was just a momentary lapse that will be ignored (like Rita's kids) in Season 7.<br /><br />2. Colin Hanks was, to me, a confusing choice of an actor for such a major role on the show.  I think I understand the premise behind the choice; namely, they wanted an actor who was able to look innocent and gullible so that he could ultimately have the audience bamboozled.  Instead, this audience-member was bamboozled by the fact that they chose an actor who couldn't live up to the role and reputation of a Dexter foe.  In other words, I thought young Hanks was a dud.  Sorry, but I have to agree with other reviewers who've said the same thing.  I also think that Edward James Olmos was under-used.<br /><br />In all, I think that this season was \\"okay\\", but hope the writers stop trying to reinvent the wheel when it comes to the characters - especially Dexter, who should be developed as a better, and more intense, main character instead of going backwards.  However, as usual, I still can't wait for the next season to start!
B0086700CM|5.0|Love This Game! It keeps you coming back for more.<br />This game difinitely has I way of testing your reflexes &amp; mobility But! Don't take your eyes off the board or you just might run into the boobie trap

B000BBOUU4|5.0|Johnny Deep is one of the greatest actors of all time. And as this movie is more acurate than Willy Wonka, it also has a more sloid story and a more in depth and crazy Wonka. If your a fan of Johnny Deep than this is a must own for youm along with that its a 2 disc DVD set packed with tons of extras. Well worth the price!

B0077SGMXM|5.0|a great game with tons of levels!  hours and hours of fun to be had. I'm just starting to get into the intermediate levels and I'm still having a blast with this game. unlike other apps, I don't feel pressured to buy credits andother useless junk. the game stands on its own and delivers excellent entertainment for the investment.
B004TI5N38|3.0|For most of [[ASIN:B004TI5N38 Zero Day]], the story moves at a fast clip, taking the reader right into the midst of a mystery set in a small West Virginia coal mining town.<br /><br />Four people murdered in their homes sets the scene, and shortly thereafter, we meet Special Agent John Puller, a military man sent in to solve the murders, in cooperation with local detective Sam Cole (Samantha).<br /><br />Before the two are barely immersed in the crime scene, three more dead bodies show up, one in the basement and two across the street.<br /><br />Motivated by the horrific crimes, Puller and Cole dig in, finding clues as they go, but as with most murders, there are no readily apparent suspects or motives.<br /><br />What does an old concrete bunker have to do with what is happening?  How does a motorcycle club figure in to it all?  And what, if anything, does the richest man in town know about what is happening?<br /><br />I enjoyed the interaction and mounting attraction between Puller and Cole, but even as they seemingly grew closer to solving the case, obstacles appeared from the most unlikely sources, including extra layers of bureaucracy.  Who can our hero and heroine trust and what drastic measures must they take?<br /><br />The story sagged for me at times and I even felt bored by the minutiae that cropped up at every turn.  Therefore...3.5 stars for me.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|There are no instructions on how to play these games.  You have to guess.  Some I never did figure it out.@
B008JGSM6G|4.0|The game starts off really easy, but the timed games are worth the download alone. The harder puzzles are a great time killer as well.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|I can't express enough how much I love this show.  Bryan Cranston is a complete master in his portrayal of Walter White.  The descent of Mr. White into the dark channels of the meth business is captivating.  Aaron Paul's Jesse Pinkman has a lot of character development during this season, and I cannot for a second imagine Walter without Jesse.<br /><br />There's a lot of darkness involved in this season, and I have to say of them all season four is by far my favorite.  These characters are incredible, and I only wish I could meet the entire cast and crew so I could shake all of their hands and express how much I love this entire experience.<br /><br />I very highly recommend that you watch the bloopers on this DVD in the special features as well--it's hilarious, and shows just how goofy all of the actors can be.  It will make you want to meet them just as much as I do! :)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|has lots of games but u have to work for more points to buy them. which means playing the same games over and over again.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|When I got the game it seemed preety fun but as soon as I was about to finish a level it would change to a different level????????????:(
B003O86FMW|4.0|Katniss continues to be extremely confused about the two men in her life, Peeta and Gale, while uprisings begin in many districts, the dangers of the Quarter Quell nears, and it becomes clear that the Capitol holds Katniss responsible for the unrest, making blatant threats to all she holds dear. Though she's still not my favorite character, Katniss's obvious bewilderment over the Peeta and Gale situation, makes me feel a bit better about her, if nothing else just to know that she isn't just being cold out of spite. You can't help but like Peeta, the man has few if any flaws, and he continues as such. The Capitol in all their ugliness is finally revealed in this story, and I'll be interested to see how it all turns out in the last book in this series, Mockingjay.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Great game. Just the right amount of difficulty. Almost makes me want to tear my hair out but not quite.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|My friend requested that I buy this movie for him, and I did. Although I haven't seen this DVD yet, my friend loves the movie, and I may purchase one in the future for myself.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|This book has no entertainment value at all. Don't read this book. The creativity that was used in this book is very repetitive... I had a very hard time finishing it, and I will read anything
0525952616|4.0|I can't say this is science fiction so much as a near (actually, really near) future war story.  I know a guy in Boulder, CO. that consults for the military creating a specialized Android OS specific to the US Air Force designed to fly, remotely, jets.  As in F18 type jets.  He told me almost 2 years ago about how they had to have autonomous operations if they were cut off from remote control and much of what I read in this book sounds very similar to concepts my friend told me about over lunch at a restaurant on Pearl street in 2010.<br /><br />2010.<br /><br />So, not so 'near future' as 'tomorrow or the day after' future.<br /><br />As far as this book is concerned.. exceptionally well written.  He's using a Tom Clancy like style and, for a story like this, it works beautifully.  Fast paced, (reasonably) believable characters and an excellent plot line.<br /><br />The only thing that bugs me (and the reason I'm giving this a 4 instead of a 5 star rating) is his trick of getting me to buy the 'whole' story twice.  He did this with his first two books (Daemon and Freedom).  It's effectively a clever selling technique to make more money.  He's not exactly serializing the story like the old SciFi guys used to.  He takes a longer story, finds a good break point in the middle, and prints the first book (1/2 the story) at full price, then the second book (finishing the story), also at full price.  You'll notice this book is a little short.  That's because, I'm betting, he's not done (at least, I hope not.  There were some major plot lines left unanswered).<br /><br />Still, if you like his first two (really one) books, and Tom Clancy's style, you'll love Kill Decision.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0525952616 Kill Decision]]
0547258305|5.0|Graceling is one of my very favorite fantasy novels. It's set in a land with seven kingdoms: Nander, Wester, Estill, Sunder, Monsea, Middluns, and Lienid. In the lands, some people are \\"Graced\\" with a special skill. Their eyes are different colors, and they are called Gracelings. It might be something harmless, like talking backwards, or something dangerous, like killing. Katsa is the niece of the king of the Middluns, and her grace is killing. Or is it? She meets Prince Po of Lienid, Graced with fighting skills (or is he?), who is searching for the reason that his grandfather got kidnapped. She and Po practice fighting often, and eventually, they set out on a journey to Monsea to investigate the suspicious King Leck of Monsea. Obviously, Katsa and Po fall in love on their way.<br /><br />The characters in Graceling are really wonderful. Katsa is a great strong character, struggling with the way she sees herself, and Po-well, I love Po. There are a lot of surprises in the book, so I won't spoil it, but this is a really exciting fantasy. Definitely one of my Top 10 Books. There are two other books about this land, Fire and Bitterblue, which I look forward to reading. You can read Becky's review here.<br /><br />You can read all of my reviews at my book blog, novareviews.blogspot.com.
B004LQGXPA|3.0|This was purchased based on memories of having seen the film in the theater when first released. At the time, it seemed well done and a reasonably accurate depiction of General Patton's activities during WWII. Unfortunately, the memories were better than the viewing of the DVD, perhaps due to having read considerably more history of those activities.<br /><br />In any case, the DVD didn't come up to par and was a somewhat gratuitous representation of Patton's role in the war. While it wasn't a total wash-out, it failed to accurately and fully depict what occurred, avoided all the politics between Ike and Patton and glossed over military operations that were depicted.<br /><br />Not a good buy from this reviewer's perspective, unless for collection purposes.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I like the simplicity of this app. One quick touch and I know all I need to know about the power situation on my Kindle Fire.
B0085776BG|3.0|For what it is, generally good. There are considerably worse depictions. Shows a part of WWII history about which little is generally known by the public at large. Tends to be glossed over in many areas after having read what histories are available on the subject, but is generally true to what occured overall.<br /><br />The focus on a few men involved in this part of the Tuskegee Airmen's role in the air war over Germany is to be expected, but the true intensity of their efforts to be an active part of the war and their deadly involvement therein is lacking. A good story, but just that - a simple story. A bit maudlin in places, which could have been avoided by better scripting.<br /><br />The best aspects of the DVD are depictions of the conditions and equipment that were in existence during the times of the war. Some of the computer graphics utilized leave a good deal to be desired - much too realistic to have been shot by gun cameras and the like of the time, or now for that matter, and, as a result, tend to be \\"cartoonish.\\" Overall, however, film reasonably well done and accurate as to equipment.<br /><br />Not recommended for purchase by this reviewer except for collection purposes.
0345803485|1.0|I know everything must be already written about this book, but I can't stay quiet about it. Possibly the worst book I've ever read. It is so badly written I can't believe they published something like that, and I am even more surprised to know that there actually are people who thinks this is a good book?!? I try to understand: this book MUST be read as a total fantasy. There's nothing real with the characters, nothing. They are taken to the extremes, Anastasia (why did the author choose names like this?!) is an innocent, non-masturbating literature student without and e-mail address in year 2011, and Christian is a billionare at his late 20's. Conserning the kinkier sex I find it hard to believe that this lifestyle is for young people. The most ridiculous part is the thought of a virgin girl having the first orgasm in her life FIRST time she ever has sex with a man she doesn't even know. He he.<br /><br />But seriously, where were the editors? The language used in this book is terrible. This is no literature. Don't waste your time and money on this.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|soo much fun you just want to keep playing.  really great on kindle fire fast downloading . some levels are little confusing but easy ti get threw
0783116934|5.0|Wonderfully acted.  Stephen Rea and Donald Sutherland were awesome in it.  The story was chilling, not just for the serial killer, but the actions of the government.  I re-watch this movie, and make other people watch it when they tell me they haven't seen it.  Worth every penny of whatever you spend on it.
B00CKYHH6O|3.0|this review is pertaining to the blu-ray edition which to me is inferior to the DVD edition. Firstly, the sound, if you are using an HDMI TV and a 5.1 system that uses an optical cable instead of HDMI then the sound will be faint, barely audible, even with your volume up 3/4 or higher, except the title music which is blaring loud!  Since most people aren't rich enough for those fancy pancy 7.1 HDMI systems that is a factor in buying. DO NOT buy this blu ray the sound is horrible! Those giving this thing anything more than 3 stars obviously have the HDMI sound systems.  Second, the video in certain scenes(if you are even halfway observant) is not restored and is quite grainy, this is evident on HDTVs as small as 37\\", my TV. Many areas, specifically in Captain Picard's ready room and areas outside the bridge or scenes deamed by Paramont as \\"Unimportant\\".  Not all scenes are restored, only major ones. Some are downright awful and worse than the regular DVD edition which isn't half bad IMO. and lastly, the menu is horribly loud and rumbles excessively much like the ones on the STO.<br />That said, the actual feature is quite good, though not the best season I just wish the sound were better so I could actually watch it!!! :(
0553386794|5.0|I am one of the people who had not heard about this book until the show aired on television. After season 2 I decided that I would pick up the book and see how it compared. I am happy that I did. It is a well written book and the characters are developed nicely. You get a true sense of how they feel and a look at why they are doing the things they are doing. IF you watched the show first as I did you might find that it feels kind of slow  but if you are a true fan you should not mind.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|All in all I must say that I truly enjoyed reading this book. I am 29 years old and was skeptical of reading a book seemingly geared towards teens. Gotta say I was pleasantly surprised. There was just enough action and romance to keep me going. I enjoyed the characters but would have liked to see them developed a little bit better.
B00322PK2G|2.0|Love everything about this watch except it ticks way too loud!!!! I'm a nurse so I wanted a simple watch with an easy to read second hand, which this watch has and its easy to clean, but I can't handle the ticking. Even my patients have commented on how loud it ticks!

006091307X|2.0|Subversive? Stupid? Both? The Crying of Lot 49 is a satire of something, perhaps itself. Characters and places have silly names, witty parodies engage in absurdist hijinks, and deep down there might be some sort of meaning about the failure of language. Of course, you're not supposed to care about the meaning if you want to enjoy this book. It's a long and clever joke whose only true target is itself. While the creative or inventive potential of this is high, the result just falls apart as it goes on. (But then again, this is supposed to represent entropy probably. It's clever, see, but not very enjoyable for being so)<br />All this said, the one thing this book left me wanting to do most was read another Thomas Pynchon book. His writing (except for in the beginning few chapters) was solid, and the ideas he does communicate are interesting. He's quoted as saying that The Crying of Lot 49 was a mistake of a book, and agreeing with that and wanting to get an actually representative representation of his work, I move on to Gravity's Rainbow. But later. I'm tired enough of The Crying of Lot 49.
B007GEMQ2I|5.0|Came super fast and was easy to build it has a little less of a challenge than the other Lego sets but its still my favorite. It is very big compare to all my other modular builings!

Trust me I get evrything off amazon this is the best thing I've gotten so far!
B005CC0CMC|3.0|I got this knowing that it was pretty cheap $20 for 4 books is not bad at all.<br /><br />Until I got to the 4th book. 100 pages were missing all in one order. I was highly disappointed and had to go somewhere else to buy the book in a hurry.
0812993292|3.0|This book was recommended if you liked reading \\"Major Pettigrew's Last Stand\\" I guess the similarities are old men and England. I enjoyed \\"Major Pettigrew\\" much more.<br /><br />The main character is Harold, an older retired man, who receives information from an old friend/co-worker about her being ill. He decides to write a letter and mail it to her the same day. As he walks to the post--he decides to keep on walking. He is then on a pilgrimage to walk to his friend (hundreds of miles) unprepared.<br /><br />Throughout the walk he regains memories and a better understanding of himself. Some it is very touching and some of it is monotonous. I can't say I disliked this book, but I can't say that I loved it either. It was ok, but seemed to fall a little flat overall.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game is awesome the puzzles are awesome but the thing I like best is the music that is used it is really calming.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is awesome it is like the movie ice age i love it and it as an awesome way 2 use ur time

B007XNAOS0|5.0|I have been listening to this album daily since I picked it up which I wasn't doing with their previews albums so they have been doing something right for me. I love the different textures and the well crafted songs. Everything seems to be where it belongs creating a great atmosphere. When the heavy moments happen you notice because they build them so well. And of course the artwork is beautiful. One last thing: I'm glad some of these bands are learning to power of singing. You can only scream and growl for so long in my book then it's time to mature and learn how to grow out of making niche music tastefully. Everything can be done if it's done tastefully and in my opinion I think this album has achieved that.

1400052181|5.0|As soon as this book arrived,I could not stop reading! The author,Rebecca Skloot,has done her research,and documents Henrietta's life and her story so wonderfully,that you are transported into a time and ways of life that touch your heart. I had been vaguely aware of the HeLa cell strain,but had no idea of the origin nor of the human story behind those cells.They are ubiquitous,virtually involved in the lives of almost every human alive.<br /><br />The story of Henrietta's family is just as deeply touching as her own story.This also raises so many questions regarding the supposed ethics or lack of them when it comes to medical testing,& the breakthroughs resulting from using human tissues in experimental work. Human tissue that has been \\"recovered\\" through surgery or other medical procedures ends up belonging to laboratories that may profit from the cells,no longer considered belonging to the human donor. While Henrietta Lacks' cells were originally freely donated by her doctor to further cancer research,HeLa cells are now bought and sold,leaving her heirs in a limbo of poverty and regret as well as unanswered questions about themselves. As her descendants,they have also been tested and genetically profiled. Thank you,Ms Skloot,for bringing the human factor back to the forefront of genetic experiments!<br />Marie Snow Taber  Clyde,NY
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Curse you, John Green, for writing a book that hooked me so hard I stayed up until nearly 2:00 this morning finishing it. Curse you for writing a book so emotionally gripping that I was sobbing on my couch in the middle of the night. And curse you for writing a book that I cannot get out of my head, one that I am so sad to have finished. By curse you, of course I mean \\"thank you.\\"<br /><br />When teenagers Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus \\"Gus\\" Waters meet in a support group for kids with cancer, they are drawn to each other immediately. Gus is in remission from the osteosarcoma that took one of his legs a few years ago, and thanks to a miracle drug trial, the tumors in Hazel's lungs aren't continuing to grow, although she knows that's just a matter of time. The two are snarky, sarcastic, sensitive, and wise beyond their years, and begin an intense friendship that brings them both joy. Hazel introduces Gus to her favorite book, called An Imperial Affliction (she calls it her best friend next to her parents); their mutual love for the book and desire to know what happened to the characters after its abrupt ending sends them on a memorable journey to track down the reclusive author. Green's depiction of both Hazel and Gus, and their interactions with friends and family, felt totally genuine and moving.<br /><br />John Green is the co-author of one of my favorite books from 2010, Will Grayson, Will Grayson, and this new book is easily one of the best I've read in quite some time, both for the quality of Green's writing as well as the emotions it evoked in me. Clearly, a book about teenagers who meet in a cancer support group is headed in a direction you don't want it to, but even the journey Green takes you on is worth the sadness. I loved this book tremendously and honestly cannot say enough good things about it. It's not for everyone, but if you know what you're getting yourself into, I think you'll agree how much you'll love taking Hazel and Gus into your hearts.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|no really not to bad...fun games for the most part. some lame ones in here but pretty well done thanks.
B004G8QTS4|4.0|There's always an intrinsic coolness in Don Winslow's novels, whether he's writing his series with PI Neal Carey, chronicling the battles between drug cartels, or following a group of surfing friends, as he does in his terrific book, The Gentlemen's Hour. It's a combination of his vividly drawn characters and their often quirky-yet-authentic dialogue, as well as his ability to make you feel you're watching the action unfold in front of you.<br /><br />The Gentlemen's Hour is a follow-up to his 2009 novel, The Dawn Patrol, both of which follow a group of surfers on San Diego's Pacific Beach, which has been rocked by the violent murder of local legend Kelly Kuhio. The case seems open-and-shut: the killer, a wealthy member of a surfing gang, has confessed, and a number of witnesses say they saw him throw the fatal punch. Yet when PI Boone Daniels is asked to investigate the crime to determine whether the charge of first-degree murder should stick, in addition to alienating his long-time friends and the Pacific Beach community, he finds a lot of things to prove the incident wasn't as cut and dried as it appeared. And that's only one of his cases, as he also is asked by a friend to determine if his wife is having an affair. Couple that chaos with a great deal of self-discovery, and it's not all \\"hang loose\\" for Boone Daniels.<br /><br />I love the way Don Winslow writes, and every character in Boone's group is much more complex than they appear initially. Winslow takes the surfer stereotype and turns it on its ear--sure, these characters are obsessed with finding the perfect wave (or any wave at all) and may fall into surfer speak, but they are much smarter and profound than you think. This is a great book, packed with action and character exposition, although at times it gets a little bogged down in background detail. Winslow did introduce a psychotic villain, who I feared was going to derail the entire book, but luckily he makes only a brief (yet annoying) appearance.All in all, I enjoyed this tremendously, as I have enjoyed nearly every one of Winslow's other books. I hope he's hard at work writing the next one!
B008MEM24S|5.0|this game is really fun it is cool how maker monagram and Dr.d and Carl can all talk to Him in the game. also in the came what's accolade about it that it has laziest and Dr.d inventions
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|This is a wonderfully magical and compelling book. If all you know about vampires comes from the Twilight series, and all that you know about witches, wizards, and demons comes from Harry Potter, I'd definitely encourage you to give this book a chance.<br /><br />Diana Bishop is a witch, descended from a long line of witches dating back to the Salem trials. But after her parents were killed tragically in Africa when she was young, Diana has done everything she can to avoid using her magic. (She doesn't think putting a spell on the washing machine to keep it from flooding counts.) Diana is a famed scholar and historian, doing research on alchemy at Oxford. One day while reviewing resources at Oxford's Bodleian Library she encounters an historical alchemical manuscript which provides secrets to the origins of witches, vampires, and demons. The manuscript is enchanted, and somehow Diana is able to break the spell briefly, which brings her to the attention of many who want the manuscript for their own, including Oxford geneticist Matthew Clairmont, who happens to be a vampire. Diana finds herself drawn to Matthew, which causes frictions between witches and vampires long hidden in history to come to the surface, and they encounter many a person (and creature) looking to do them harm.<br /><br />This book really fascinated me. Deborah Harkness created truly vivd characters that transcend the typical stereotypes of witch or vampire yet retain some of the familiar characteristics we've come to know. The story is part epic adventure, part fantasy, with even a little soap opera thrown in for good measure, yet the action and story development never stop. I really found myself wondering what the next step was in Diana and Matthew's relationship, and hope Harkness will revisit her characters in a later story. If you're at all intrigued by this type of book, read A Discovery of Witches. Definitely a terrifically compelling romp.
030758836X|3.0|It was a slow start and I had trouble keeping interest but then it picks up and is a very interesting and plot twisting story! I was very much looking forward to the exciting conclusion but was so disappointed...the writer built it up so wonderfully up to this point and then it seems like they were rushed to finish it and it was this strange, quick ending. Very disappointing. A \\"good\\" read but nothing I'd recommend...
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Growing up, Stephen King was easily one of my favorite authors. Many of his novels created indelible impressions in my mind. (I still have a distrust of clowns thanks to It, and just thinking about The Stand makes me cough.) But my fondness for King has wavered a bit over the last 15 or so years, as I started discovering that as his novels grew in size, his ability to close out a story (from often exceptional ideas) suffered somewhat. Needless to say, I put a great deal of thought into deciding whether or not to read his latest opus, the nearly 900-page 11/22/63, but after flying through it in less than a week, I can unequivocally say this novel should be ranked among some of King's best work.<br /><br />Jake Epping is an English teacher in Lisbon Falls, Maine, who teaches GED English classes as a way to make extra money. In response to an assignment in which he asked his students to talk about a life-changing incident, he learns that Harry Dunning, a handicapped janitor, was injured by his father during a violent rampage on Halloween night in 1958, the night he killed Harry's mother and three siblings with a hammer. This discovery deeply affects Jake, and when his friend, local diner owner Al, shows him a hidden time portal in the diner that transports you back to September 1958, Jake jumps at the chance to go back in time and prevent this massacre. No matter how long you're \\"back,\\" when you return to the present you've only been gone for two minutes, and if you ever go back through the portal again, everything that happened on your last visit resets. Once Al realizes he has a kindred spirit in Jake, he enlists him in the ultimate heroic mission--stopping Lee Harvey Oswald from assassinating John F. Kennedy. But time and history do not enjoy being diverted from their plans...<br /><br />There have been thousands of books written about time travel and the idea of righting past wrongs, but in Stephen King's tremendously capable hands, this concept seems fresh and unique. I kept wondering what twists would come next, but none of them detracted from my complete enjoyment of this book. Almost every character has great depth and they easily draw you into their stories. And when a book of nearly 900 pages reads like a 300-pager, you know you're in the hands of a master. Is some of the plot predictable? Sure, but it's still utterly compelling. Don't be put off by the heft of the book or its subject matter--at its core, this is a story about love, history, and trying to do the right thing, even though it may have larger ramifications. Truly a fantastic book.
B005LAIGOQ|3.0|Watched this twice in one night, with two different sets of family members. Second time through it was easy to see plot holes. Untied, or shabbily tied ends.<br /><br />For me, the basis of WHY just wasn't strong enough. That said, I'd still recommend the show -- it's fun spooky, not gross or so creepy you have nightmares. I'm glad they still make movies like this, since I don't watch the extreme other horror flicks that stick to your bones.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book was frigging awesome! Children of the 80s, especially video game junkies, here is the book for you. Combining the adventure, danger, action, companionship, romance, violence, and fantasy of the best quest novels with fantastic 80s trivia, Ernest Cline has outdone himself with his very first book.<br /><br />It's 2044, and the real world is an awful place. The environment has been destroyed, there's a worldwide energy shortage, nearly all people live in abject poverty, and the only escape is plugging into OASIS, a virtual world made up of thousands of planets, where you can be anyone or anything you want to, do anything you want, even fall in love. Because schools became so dangerous they have been replicated virtually on OASIS, ensuring students pay attention and face no threat of bullying. Like everyone else, Wade Watts uses OASIS to escape the bleak world he lives in. And one day, the creator of OASIS, James Halliday--a highly eccentric, 80s-obssessed multibillionaire--dies, but he leaves one final gift for the world, a series of puzzles and challenges sure to test anyone. But the winner will have ultimate control of OASIS. And the challenges are unlike anything you could imagine. Wade, like millions of others, tries and tries to solve the challenges for years, until one day, he stumbles onto the first clue. And then the greatest adventure--and the greatest threats--of his life begins.<br /><br />I'm a sucker for books about a noble hero on a quest, so needless to say, Ready Player One sucked me in from the get-go. This is a story about courage, friendship, love, good, and evil, with the 1980s and the worlds of classic video and adventure games and anime as its backdrop. Cline definitely lets you get lost in the geekery, but he has created terrific, memorable characters who draw you into their lives, and the action sequences are fast-paced and creative. I can only imagine what a phenomenal movie this would be, but I can say for certain it is an exceptional book. Easily one of the best I've read in quite some time.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is a good as the original, but with the Phineas and Ferb addition, it is excellent! Well worth the cost.
B00338QENI|5.0|Henrietta Lacks was a poor Southern woman and mother of five children who died in 1951 as the result of a remarkably aggressive form of cervical cancer. While undergoing radiation treatment, doctors at Johns Hopkins took samples of her cells without her consent, to better study the cancer. These cells, known as HeLa, became an important scientific and medical tool--they were the first \\"immortal\\" human cells grown in culture, and they are still alive today. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb's effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. But very little was known about the woman from whom these cells came, and her family was unaware of Henrietta's contributions to science for many, many years.<br /><br />The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks tells Henrietta's story and chronicles the struggles of her family, most of whom never had the opportunity to even finish high school, to understand what cells were taken from her and what scientists were doing with them. Rebecca Skloot also gives a great deal of background into scientific research, particularly where cell and tissue study is concerned, and the challenges both the scientific and medical ethics communities face relative to \\"donations\\" of cells taken from patients. But in the end, this is the story of Henrietta's family and the emotions that the discovery of her role in science uncovers.<br /><br />While the subject of this book is very scientific, much of it reads like a novel. It is a fantastic story--sometimes shocking, sometimes heartbreaking--but Skloot gives depth not only to Henrietta and her family, but the researchers who both studied and questioned the HeLa cells through the years. When this book was released last year to tremendous acclaim, I didn't think it would interest me much, but a friend recently recommended it, and I'm glad I was motivated to pick it up. Don't be put off by the subject matter; in the end, this will pique your curiosity and tug at your heart. And you'll definitely look with a different eye at the next medical procedure you have!
B004G600A4|4.0|My adult daughter \\"made\\" me watch this movie, a take off on the Repunzel fairy tale.  I rolled my eyes, thinking this another Disney clunker, but boy was I surprised.  This was a snappy, fun movie with clever, likeable characters and a fun plot with plenty of action, kind of like Shrek without Shrek.  And, not surprising because it was a Disney film, the animation and computer generated effects, were both beautiful and exciting.  This was a good film that a wimpy ending could not even ruin.  When your daugther asks you to watch it, or any movie for that matter, don't roll your eyes!  Especially about Tangled!

3527406018|3.0|This book contains 53 typos and other errors that you'll need to correct, ranging from minor to debilitating.  I cannot fathom why the publisher still has not corrected these in the 6th printing of the 2nd edition (2011), when Griffiths sent them the corrections in 2009.  And the brand new, shrink-wrapped copy that I ordered directly from Amazon themselves didn't even include the errata sheet listing the 53 corrections!  I had to download this errata sheet myself (Amazon won't let me post the link, but it's a simple Google search.)  Bad form, Amazon.  And bad form, Wiley-VCH.<br /><br />With these corrections (that I penciled into my copy before reading), it's an excellent book.  All books have corrections like these during the final editing process; it's perfectly normal.  What's not normal is that the publisher never applied the corrections.<br /><br />I knocked off 2 stars for the missing errata sheet, which could cause unaware readers hours of confusion.

1400052181|3.0|Hi guys,<br /><br />I had to read this book as a part of a summer reading assignment for high school and thought I would share my opinion. I intend for this review to be a sort of \\"heads-up\\" for other teenagers thinking about reading this book because, to me, it read like it was geared towards an older audience. That said, I realize that it has a spot on the New York Times bestseller list and a great deal of positive reviews here on Amazon. I'm not trying to make the point that it shouldn't have these things -- in fact, I have a feeling that I would have rated it higher if I were 20 years older right now. Setting this aside, I just want to give my perspective of this book as a teen reader, so here it goes:<br /><br />I was excited when I first got this book because I'd heard about HeLa cells on an NPR program called Radiolab. Flipping through the accolades, it seemed like the book would be just as engaging as the Radiolab segment. For me, it wasn't. On one hand, the book was very informative; you could really sense the years of interviewing, researching, and other hard work Rebecca Skloot put into writing the book. On the other hand, it was all the details about this process that became the most annoying for me to read. Going back to the point that this book is both a bestseller and positively reviewed here on Amazon leads me to speculate that I'm simply not old enough to appreciate the extensive details about the research process.<br /><br />To help explain what I mean, I'll turn to my personal experiences with writing. I've written a number of research papers over the years and similar to Skloot (though obviously on a much, much smaller scale) each one of these papers took months of research, bus trips to libraries, analyzing primary documents, talking to teachers, and even e-mailing a few random college professors for advice (on a whim). All of this was accompanied with the thorough note taking, draft writing, and proofreading that a lengthy research paper entails. What I ended up with for all of them was a final product that presented a theory and backed it with carefully selected evidence. While reading this book, I felt that Skloot was also trying to present and defend a theory: that it was unethical for a Johns Hopkins hospital doctor to take cervical cancer tissue samples from a woman (Henrietta Lacks) without her consent and subsequently neglect to acknowledge her contribution to some of the greatest medical advances of the century. However, along with this theory were extensive biographical elements regarding how Skloot went about gathering information for the book. I think that, in addition to the age barrier I mentioned earlier, these details weren't particularly interesting or engaging for me because there was no clear pattern to how she switched between Henrietta's narrative and her own. In that sense, I would call the book disorganized. To me it seemed like she was trying too hard to blend it all together, which just made the book harder to read. To be clear, this was not a page-turner for me. I had to take breaks regularly while reading it and scribble a lot of notes in the margins to keep track of what was going on. A comparable scenario would be trying to read one of my papers with all of the details about my research mixed in. It just wouldn't work.<br /><br />I think Skloot's approach was too distracting for me partly because I'm a teen reader who grew up in the \\"Google\\" generation. Because I'm used to having answers instantly, I think I would have enjoyed the book a little more if it were primarily plot-driven. Instead, Skloot spent a lot of time discussing how she came to learn about a given fact from Henrietta's life, the evolution of assorted bioethics issues over time (i.e. consent, profit, morals, racism, etc.), and the specifics of the daily (and honestly pretty mundane) struggles of Henrietta's descendants' lives. While all of these \\"side\\" subjects are certainly relevant, it was easy to get lost intrying to filter/sort all of the information she presented. Heck, I feel like Skloot had researched them all thoroughly enough to write a different book about each one!<br /><br />Regardless of my opinions about the book's format or the intended audience, I believe the book succeeded in its ultimate goal of eternalizing the story of the woman behind the cells. It was very comprehensive and humanizing -- you could get a clear sense of what Henrietta was like. My ultimate message to teen readers is that this book is a long and involved read (not the type of book you'd take to the beach), so don't go in with the same expectations you would in reading the plot-driven Harry Potter series, a moving biography, or an informative Wikipedia article; this book attempts to combine all three qualities with mixed results.

Of note is the,<br />'everything including the kitchen sink' \\"Caravan\\", the hard driving \\"Seven Cities of Gold\\", the song that I can only describe as 'By Tor&The Snow Dog 2012' \\"Headlong Flight\\", the really fun and rockin' \\"Wish Them Well\\", and the beautiful, moving and profound \\"The Garden\\". I can't seem to get enough of \\"Wish Them Well\\" and \\"The Garden\\". I've been a huge Rush fan since 2112 and pretty much love everything they have ever done. I can honestly say that this is one of my favorite Rush albums.<br />  To Geddy, Alex and Neil, thanks guys!

B001RTSPVY|5.0|Season 2 picks up right where season 1 left off.  I don't want to reveal any of the show, but if you enjoyed the first season you will absolutely love the second season.  Walt and Jesse have their ups and down, conflicts and comings together.  Overall, I love this show, and seasons 3 and 4 are great as well.

B006WB7IN8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was very well crafted, a compelling read and, needing to find out how the prologue fitted in, drove me at break-neck pace to the end.
0307474275|2.0|After all the hype, I was looking forward to reading this, but I was sorely disappointed. The plot may have been OK but the poor quality of the writing completely destroyed any potential enjoyment for me. Rightly or wrongly, I immediately dismissed the rest of Dan Brown's books as second-rate rubbish. This is surely a case of 'The Emperor's New Clothes'.
0375842209|5.0|This was a detour for me - not my usual genre of reading material at all. In fact, having read the first few pages, I nearly didn't continue. However,once I got used to the idea of the narrator being Death and having accepted that the opening was a strange one, I persevered and realised that this was quite an extraordinary book indeed. The format was interseting - chunks, peppered with little captions and asides by Death whilst telling a compelling story set in Germany during the Second World War.<br /><br />The characters quickly became real - the gentle Hans, the feisy Rosa and little Leisel, determined and spirited and around whom the story revolves. The background of Himmel Street and beyond is vividly brought to life by its collection of residents, whose involvement with Leisel has a huge impact on her life. Her childhood friend, Rudy, is her ally as they steal from the mayor's wife, Ilsa Hermann, but their relationship is much more than that, deep and lasting.<br /><br />We are led from Liesel's childhood into her teenage years as she is orphaned and fostered by the Hubermanns and are kept on the edges of our seats by the Big Secret - they are hiding a Jew in the basement, Max. Max and Liesel form a very special bond and even after he is forced to leave, he is an ongoing presence in Liesel's life.<br /><br />This book takes off in all directions. We absolutely feel for the characters and see the effect war has on this small community. As Liesel is crushed, so are we, the readers. It's the first book in a long, long time that has driven me to unstoppable tears.
B004TSXUWY|4.0|This is a cleverly written book. The concept, I imagine, will have been thought of before, but to actually formulate it into a workable novel is to be congratulated. S.J. Watson never loosens his grip on events. It is tight throughout and has a surprising and satisfying conclusion.
0307742997|3.0|I love thrillers generally, but this author didn't do it for me...nor, coincidentally, did Steig Larsson.I have to say that by the second half of the book I was enjoying it more, but my concentration lapsed a lot at the beginning. I have another Jo Nesbo to read, so I'll see if he grows on me. I tend not to enjoy books so much when the names are foreign as I forget who's who. I took some time to take the name 'Harry Hole' seriously.

1573226521|5.0|This may have been more of a 4.5-er for me, but I'm rounding up instead of down because it kept me so dang engrossed. I mean, I dreamt this thing at night, which was...well, not so pleasant, actually! It's one of those books where you know things aren't going to end so well, and you spend the entire time waiting to find out how exactly it's going to happen. The book depicts a slow disintigration--of community, of morality, of sanity, and of paradise. It's a mashup of Vietnam War movies, Conrad's Heart of Darkness, video games, and travel literature about unspoiled Edens, and half of it seems to take place in the alternate reality of main character Richard's headspace, which worked really well for me. I can see myself reading this again at some point down the line, and I am definitely looking forward to watching the movie, which I have never gotten around to doing (now I'm glad I waited). I'll definitely be checking out some of Garland's other novels as well.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is a great follow up to &quot;where's my water&quot;, easy to play and a great time passer while I am on the train to work.
0345803507|5.0|I LOVE these books. Best story I've ever read.  I can't wait for E L James to write more stories.  I couldn't put these books down I had to find out what was going to happen next.  Christian Grey is so hot and I found myself relating so much to Anastasia.  Again best books I've ever read!  Now that it's over I don't know what to do with myself.  I can't wait for the movie!  I will be first in line
B003TNM2K6|5.0|The book is always better than the movie.  This movie actually sticks to the book, to a certain extent.  I give it five stars for the acting.  The performances in this are exceptional.  The ending sucks, but the actors did an amazing job.

B004UXUX4Q|4.0|The Descendants is definitely a polarizing film, but such is art. George Clooney won me over, his portrayal of a workaholic real estate lawyer faced with desperate circumstances drove the film. What I liked most about the film is that it wasnt a feel good over the top Hollywood movie filled with frantic tears and screaming. The characters in this film are flawed, yet they dont apologize, they move on and try and make things right. The director respects us enough not to spell everything out, especially with the ending. Its about forgiveness, no matter how much someone has hurt you, its the only way you can heal.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My daughter and I play this together!! She loves it, it can be used as a valuable teaching tool as well! I recommend this for any family, especially if you love Ice Age as my family and I do!!
B0076NKNLA|2.0|My Week With Marilyn is all about Marilyn Monroe's appeal and stardom. The problem is the acting, script and direction is a B+. Michelle Williams is definitely beautiful, but she lacks that amazing charm and charisma that Marilyn possessed. Williams was better in the more melancholic, painful scenes, but it was frustrating, it could've been a much better character study.<br />Even if the film is a true story, it comes off as too much of a school boy fantasy, and the main character can hardly gain sympathy for playing the girl next door and then running off with the lead actress. The direction of the film told the story, but it lacked a memorable iconic moment. Lets get a few shots of Marilyn by herself, or at least some archival footage of the real Marilyn. Kenneth Branagh and Dame Judi Dench were the scene stealers for me, and Julia Ormond was lovely as Vivian Leigh. The movie left me wanting to see the actors actual films, like Streecar named Desire (Leigh), The Seven Year Itch (Monroe) and Hamlet (Olivier).
B0054JZC6E|4.0|tons of games, it is very entertaining, some of the games can be quite challinging, the more you play the more games
1400069289|5.0|Many of us pick up popular neuroscience books with a question at the back of our minds:  How can the content in this book help me?  If this is your main reason for picking up the book, the first part on habits and individuals will be extremely interesting, but you might decide to skip the rest of the book about habits in business and society.  If you did, however, you would miss some fantastic material, also very relevant to each reader.  There are some interesting theories about the elusive success of AA, some original, somewhat frightening, research about Target and marketing, and some truly inspirational stories about change in society.<br /><br />In the latter sections of the book we learn that an important factor in creating lasting change is belonging to a group that supports that change.  As Americans who tend to individualism, this is an important lesson for us.  Another, though never explicitly implied, lesson is that lasting social progress is possible.  Quite good news for those of us jaded and depressed by modern life.<br /><br />Personally, I found this book relevatory about myself and my family.  We suffered with a very cluttered house for years.  When we moved one mile away, I threw out bags of stuff, but the clutter never seemed to dissipate.  When we re-located to the States, we flew over and rented a house, but all of our things traveled by container ship, taking a leisurely six weeks.  When it finally arrived we pulled out a few things we genuinely missed and, puzzled by our own change of hearts, left the rest in the garage.  Reading this book, I finally understood why.  Expecting our things at any time, we hardly bought anything new.  Over six weeks we had generated the habit of living in spacious, tidy rooms.  An expensive way to replace a habit, but by golly, it worked.

B001HN6922|5.0|I Really  Enjoyed this Movie through and Through. the story is truly Thrilling! and keeps you intrigued and Laughing Consistently Pixar has outdone themselves when it comes to a Cars Sequel. the film is filled with wonderful Humor. Fast Paced Racing and unexpected Surprises! involving a James Bond Twist that's absolutely Hilarious when Mater everyone's favorite Buck-Toothed Truck gets caught up in international Espionage meeting two Agents Swift and Sleek Holley Shiftwell and Super Heavy Duty Finn Mcmissile the film has a lot of Good Lessons like Friendship and just because your different doesn't mean you should make fun of someone. a Real Buy! for anyone to own its a Perfect Family Movie! that's sure to leave everyone Howling with exitment and laughs!!

B00275EHJG|5.0|Toy Story 3 is Wonderful Fun and Laughs for the entire Family! its the kind of movie you can never get tired of. as is the usually case most sequels are never as good as the originals but its just the opposite with Toy Story 3 the story is very Funny with a Lot of Heart. and Wonderful Lessons in friendship and how Woody Buzz Jessie and the rest of the gang stick together no matter what they have to face. the Movie is perfect for kids and will enthrall them to the End. Another reason I think its the best One is because Pixar combines Hilarious Humor. Heartwarming scenes and Dazzling New Toys! like a Strawberry scented bear named Lotso and more really cool New Toys its also the most Exiting one because of all the comic action.the film really is a must See For all Fans who want a third amazing adventure starring their favorite Toys! Buy!

B006RED4GA|1.0|I love scary movies, but this was one of the worst I've ever seen.  There is little to no character development, the plot moves at a snail's pace, mysteries are raised and unresolved, and the end is entirely unsatisfying.  Boring, boring, boring.

0345803485|5.0|I loved this book & the other 2 that follow. I have never read books so fast in my life. I normally only read nonfiction...and have not read fiction in about 15 years, but had to see what all the hype was about. After finishing the series, I'm surprised how many negative reviews are made on this book. It's FICTION - it's a made-up story. All the sex is outlandish, but makes you think about the kinkier side of sex. I felt a connection to Ana & Christian - especially Christian Grey. Who wouldn't want this HOT multimillionaire in their life and you be the woman to free him of his demons?  I read the first 2 books so fast & slowed down for the 3rd just because I didn't want it to be over. Some of the story was a bit repetitive, but not completely. It held my interest. I love the way the series ended! If you are debating whether or not to read this book, just hold an open mind & know that it's sexual, the storyline is made up, & simply slip your mind into that of the characters.
B0058VW36U|4.0|Tjis game is amazing, and is definately worh the 99&cent;, but you guys REALLY NEED TO MAKE MORE LEVELS. The levels you have are ingeniously clever and fun, but there are too few. And from the other reviews, it sounds like android already has had an update with new levels! Now that is just messed up! Otherwise though, this game is incredible!

B006GHA9QQ|5.0|Honestly the first time I saw this movie, I was not sure what to think about it.  It wasn't until I watched for the second time that I fell in love with it.  It is different, and not quite what I was expecting, but it is still amazing none the less.  I love the music and the plot twists that happen.  Like some other reviewers have said, keep an open mind.  Don't go in with any preconceived ideas and you will not regret it.
0439023521|5.0|It's been a long time since I started reading a book an have drawn in from the first page. This book is truly amazing, entertaining, suspenseful and romantic at the same time. I absolutely loved it and highly recommend it. Great story!
B007ZBWJXI|3.0|Looking at all the reviews here could intimidate a person into not writing a review of \\"XXX\\". The viciousness of the 'fans' here is amazing. So, let's get this out of the way first: For me Asia was always Downes, Howe, Palmer and Wetton. Always. I'm not saying anything about Payne because I never bought and listened to Payne-era Asia. Except for 1992's \\"Aqua\\" and I think 1994's \\"Aria\\", both of which were sub-par, and it had nothing to do with Payne.<br /><br />I also liked \\"Alpha\\" and \\"Astra\\". Sorry, but I think both of them are good albums alongside \\"Asia\\". Even Mandy Meyer on \\"Astra\\" does a stand up job in the absence of Howe.<br /><br />So what's my problem with reunited Asia? Well, it's not Wetton's vocals--I think they are still strong if a little weathered by age. It's not Howe's playing, though I do agree it's not as aggressive and it feels lower in the mix. Then I get to thinking about Palmer's drumming, and I think it's not as interesting or adventurous or as aggressive as it once was. But for me, the main culprit is Downes. I don't like his choice in synthesizers on these last three Asia albums. His choice of keyboards and synth sounds are, well, cheesy. It seemed to me that he was more careful about keys on the first three Asia albums from the 80's. I keep thinking Downes is out of touch with the latest technologies.<br /><br />So, no guitars the equivalent of Howe's \\"Heat Of The Moment\\" licks. No drums like \\"Heat Of The Moment\\". No synths like the very distinctive \\"Only Time Will Tell\\" (or even \\"Video Kill The Radio Star\\") or \\"The Smile Has Left Your Eyes\\" or \\"Rock And Roll Dream\\".<br /><br />And, the more I think about it, the more I think the band is truly missing it's secret weapon--producer Mike Stone. He is deceased now, but he really knew how to structure the band's music into something great. He knew how to capture the essence of this band and polish up real nice. That's been missing from 2008's \\"Phoenix\\", 2010's \\"Omega\\" and now \\"XXX\\".<br /><br />To me, \\"XXX\\" is no different from \\"Phoenix\\" or \\"Omega\\", in fact you could put all three into a blender and hit random select and they would all sound like they came from the same sessions.<br /><br />The key tracks are \\"Tomorrow The World\\", \\"Bury Me In Willow\\", \\"Face On The Bridge\\" and...and...and that's really it. The rest of the songs are slick and faceless. I don't like the religious bent of songs like \\"No Religion\\" or \\"Judas\\". I don't like the midnight mix of \\"I Know How You Feel\\". So the album just kind of sits there--neither terrible nor great.<br /><br />I expect more from these guys. I've been saying that for three albums now. And don't give me the pat response of, \\"Well you can just listen to the first three albums over and over and over then.\\" Get real, you know this band could be doing so much more than this. The production values are weak--they need a real producer who might understand what sound is needed--someone like Jack Douglas, or Tom Werman, or Ted Templeman, or Robert John \\"Mutt\\" Lange, or Bob Rock, or Alan Moulder, or Flood, or Butch Vig. Somebody, any one of those would do.<br /><br />Okay, fire away, click that negative vote button. \\"XXX\\" is just mediocre work from a solid band. Admit it to yourself before you click.<br /><br />I'm hoping they choose to make another album, but with an establish producer. Reign in Downes please. Somebody tell him he is out of touch on the keys. And could somebody please kick Palmer and wake him up from his slumber--we need more energetic and complex drum patterns please. And will someone unshackle Howe? And, of course, let's give Wetton something interesting and passionate to sing about, not some cliche biblical figure like \\"Judas\\" or some castrated doe-eyed gelding singing about \\"Faithful\\". Let's have some bite to the words next time.<br /><br />Here's how \\"XXX\\" compares to Asia's previous works:<br /><br />1982 Asia: Five Stars<br />1983 Alpha: Five Stars<br />1985 Astra: Four Stars<br />2008 Phoenix: Three and a Half Stars<br />2010 Omega: Three and a Half Stars<br />2012 XXX: Three and a Half Starsnd a Half Stars<br />2010 Omega: Three and a Half Stars<br />2012 XXX: Three and a Half Stars
1610454812|2.0|No dispersions on the SEAL. The book's description didn't give the impression everything going on deals with Christian ideals/values.  The description reads like many other war hero stories that include a goodly amount of background on the hero, but those books then don't seem to be advertised as traditional biographies that are Christian learning plans.  There is nothing wrong with Christian learning plans, but that isn't what I was buying.

0393338827|3.0|I'm not a financial person.  I handle the finances of my family and am a medical professional.  Since Lewis is the author of [[ASIN:039333838X The Blind Side (Movie Tie-in Edition)]] and [[ASIN:0393338398 Moneyball]], I thought I'd be able to follow and enjoy this book.  Instead, I found myself confused.  The Big Short deals with mortgage bonds, credit default swaps, CDO's and many other financial terms that I had never quite understood.  Although I understand them better, I had a hard time getting through this book.  In fact, I stopped at page 181 and gave up.<br />Maybe I'm not as smart as most of the people who read this.  Maybe it's just that I'm not in the financial industry.  I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone who's a layperson when it comes to Wall Street and the financial markets.

B008QE9XD2|5.0|Dark Shadows is a funny, less solemn, version of the original tv show. I'm quiet pleased with it and can't wait to get my copy even through it does have those moments that feel like \\"Stupid funny\\" where I'm wanting to shake my head at a line or scene. Can't tell if I love this more or less than the original Dark Shadows, but this is a favorite out of all of the Tim Burton movies I've seen.
B002VWNIAY|4.0|This review is for the 2009 DVD release.  I won't touch on the film itself.  If you've seen it, you know how great it is; if you haven't seen it, it's more than worth the cost of the DVD.<br /><br />The only noticeable issues with the transfer are small things that I would attribute to the master being decades old.  Nothing that takes away from the film at all, and still much better than some of the imperfections you see watching a movie in the theaters near the end of its run.<br /><br />The only hangup I have is with the aspect ratio which is why this release gets 4 stars instead of 5.  Casablanca was shot in 1.375:1 (sometimes abbreviated to 1.37:1).  'Widescreen' in movies didn't come around until about 10 years later.  This release is in 1.33:1, which is your standard 4:3 non-widescreen TV ratio.  Because of the cropping you lose about 2-3% of the image (depending on how it was cropped).  Granted, you'd be hard-pressed to notice a big difference without watching them side by side, but I would think they could have done a little better with a new release.  The Blu-ray release is advertised to be in the full 1.37:1 ratio.<br /><br />With the exception of the cropping, it's a good copy and I'm mostly happy with it.

0783226888|3.0|The bargain-rack movie for last night was \\"The Jackal\\" starring Bruce Willis and Richard Gere. I found it on the five dollar rack at Wal-Mart. Bruce Willis plays the role of a ruthless, cold blooded and-well paid assassin out to kill a leading U.S. Government official. He required 50% of the money up front and the other 50% when  they read about it in  the news. He's a master at disguises and even I was hard pressed to keep track of his identities as he continuously changed throughout the movie. Furthermore, he was constantly on the move from place to place so as to be nearly impossible to trace. Even his Dodge station wagon was outfitted such that he could wash the outer layer of paint off giving him a number of different-appearing cars. The anti-assassin, so to speak, was played by Richard Gere, an imprisoned ex-irish (IRA) terrorist who was recruited by the FBI to track down and stop Willis from completing his unknown assignment.<br /><br />Interesting Story. Totally improbable, but well done and attention holding. There was lots of suspenseful action and accompanying gore as Willis operated with his super-duper machine gun. Others in the story included Sidney Poitier as an FBI Chief and Diane Venora, a Russian intelligence officer, aiding the efforts of Gere. The acting was rather good. My interest in the plot totally wilted when I found out that the victim was the U. S. First Lady. Why? What was the point? In any case, the story moved along at a good pace. It was well filmed. The suspense was good, but the ending was rather weak. If I had a criticism, the story was just too improbable and non-convincing.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

I have my Xbox 360 connected to some PC surround sound speakers however my wife and stepdaughter don't appreciate the power that I get from this system especially when they are trying to sleep.  So most times I use my headset when watching a movie on it or when playing games.  I sit about 25' back from my 46\\" TV and have a wire running from the surround sound system to my over the ear/noise canceling JVC surround sound headphones.  Sitting back this far I didn't have any control over the volume unless I stood up and went to the speakers to adjust it.  That's why I thought this would help and it does that and so much more.  With the 3 amp settings this little thing gives me great control over the sound I am listening to.  Whether it's music I'm listening to and want a little extra bass or a movie where the voices seem to be a little low normally or a FPS where I blowing sh*t up I can adjust as needed both in volume and equalization.  Oh and since I have a [[ASIN:B00273Z9WM Nyko Charge Base 360 S for Xbox 360]] with 2 chargers on it and it has a USB charging port on the front it is easy for me to charge when needed.  Oh and speaking of charging...this thing charges very fast and keeps a charge very long.<br /><br />Update 8/12/12:<br />Seeing other reviews after mine complaining about the battery life I thought I should update this review a little.  In my application the battery life will last between 5 and 6 hours.  Rechargeable batteries need to be fully charged the first time before you use them then drained fully and charged fully again.  This will help set you up for success with your battery life both in how long between charges that are needed AND how long the product will last.<br /><br />I still love this product.  I don't ever want to be without a mini amp again.
B00425S1H8|5.0|Purchased to interface with lab equipment from Tektronix, Agilent, and SRS. I've gotten it to work with Tek from a Linux laptop (works without any driver installation -- just plug it in!... and I wrote my own software to control the instrument and grab data from it). I'll be trying with Windows soon and the other manufacturers' equipment, but I expect no issues with either.<br /><br />Note that this is a male DB-9 with screw receptacles. Don't expect it to interface with adapters that also have screw receptacles, even if they're female adapters. In the past I've hack-sawed the screw receptacles off so I could plug this directly into a female DB-9 DCE device that also has screw receptacles, but I don't think that's the best solution. Just get appropriate adapters or cabling, it's just a few dollars each and then you can screw things together to better guarantee connections are maintained.<br /><br />The Tek and HP/Agilent equipment I've worked with have male DB-9 connectors (with screw receptacles) and act as DTE devices. Therefore you'll need a null modem female DB-9 to female DB-9 cable there. The SRS equipment has female DB-25 connectors (with screw receptacles) and act as DCE devices. So you need a female DB-9 to male DB-25, but it should not be a null modem cable.

B0024FAR5M|5.0|I haven't got into these new show's playing on tv, like Sons of Anarchy before. One night husband and I fall asleep watching tv. I woke up in the middle of the night totally into a show. I didn't know what show it was till the end of the show. It was Sons of Anarchy.<br /><br />This was around Black Friday. I remember that because husband and I went to Walmart for Black Friday. We always go our own way and meet up after to go threw our findings. Walmart had Sons Of Anarchy for sale for $12.00. Hubby had doubts about the show. He saw one episode on tv and thought it was boring.<br /><br />I told him about the awesome show I watched the other day. He decided we should by the show. Once we got home we played it and he has been in love with it since. He now has the ringtone on his phone. And is looking into buying a motorcycle. LOL  He's always wanted a motorcycle, but the show pushed him into getting one sooner then later.<br /><br />This show is very cool. We are both hooked on it. I can't wait to by season 4 once it is available to buy.

B008645YEE|4.0|Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy ends with \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" and Hans Zimmer returns to bring the musical journey to a satisfactory conclusion as well with a very capable but somber score.  The reference to the Dark Knight is apt especially for this final chapter, but then the story of Bruce Wayne and Batman has always been shrouded in shadows and inner turmoil and Zimmer has labored, along with James Newton Howard, to capture these shadows musically.  This time out Zimmer is without the actual contributions of Howard, but we assume not without his influence and support. And this time the tone is clearly the darkest of the three film scores as left to Zimmer.  This is a dynamic effort with orchestra, synthesizer and chorus, one that clearly matches the dark story on the screen.  It embraces the solitary and troubled soul of Wayne and the chaotic challenge of Bane (and others?) to Gotham City and its people.  There is little semblance of a romantic theme here, indeed even the Batman motif is itself always there but in a shadowy form.  In fact there is not a great deal of new music in terms of themes but there are motifs that emerge with Bane, and those combined with earlier themes are drawn together for a grand climax.  This is a score that works so well on the screen, however many will find it too dark, and at times overly chaotic, on its own.  But it does work and comes to a finale that is a proper and fitting conclusion to the Dark Knight trilogy.  This is quite unlike Zimmer's jaunty music for Sherlock Holmes, and even darker than the scores for the two earlier Batman entries, but it is bold in that capacity and a solid effort.  Well produced and adequately packaged by Water Tower Music.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I originally looked for this book because of all the hype. Then I bought it because of all the funny negative reviews . I wanted to see just how bad it really  was.<br /><br />Simply put, if you have a mild interest in BDSM u will enjoy this book. If u dont- than u won't.. It offers some insight into the emmotional turmoil/guilt/pleasure and other complexities of such intrests.<br /><br />I personally found the way she refers to her subconscious & &#34;Inner goddess&#34; juvenile but hysterical, (u will understand what i mean if u read it). The main man &#34;Grey&#34; is very fantasy like and sorta unbelievable but its a book people- erotica no less! It's supposed to be fantastical. That being said, yes there are some grammatical errors and some repetition (but really there's only so many ways to say some things) and though I did notice it; I found that it didn't bother me. Just go with it and enjoy it for what it is.<br /><br />My subconscious is scowling at me, tapping her foot impatiently to start the next book.. My inner goddess agrees and does backflips as I hit submit review.. ;)

B0008ENIAC|5.0|I had first watched this movie some years back after my mom had recorded it from TV. This movie is truly one of the finest made in the history of American cinema. Joan Crawford plays the title role, a woman who does what she can to succeed in her life. Mildred is married to a guy who gave her two daughters, Veda and Kay. Her husband, Bert, has an affair with another woman, and Mildred goes about getting a divorce. Meanwhile, Mildred ends up with a pile of unpaid bills, and that she must get herself a job in order to keep things going for herself and her daughters. As Mildred is at the police station regarding the murder of her second husband (the one who fell in love with Veda), she describes her story of trying to get a job.<br /><br />Everywhere she went looking for a job, she was told that \\"they were looking for someone with experience\\". Finally, about to give up, she ends up going to a restaurant for a break from her job search (after seeing a \\"Help Wanted\\" sign in the window). This is where we first see Ida (Eve Arden), who is dealing with waitresses arguing over who's been taking whose tips, etc. Mildred says she wants a job, Ida asks if she ever worked in a restaurant before, Mildred says no, so Ida takes her to the back, and issues a uniform and fills her in about the uniform, etc. Mildred then tells that within a while, she becomes an excellent waitress, and is so successful, she ends up opening up a chain of her own eateries.<br />Veda is the character whom lots of viewers love to hate, because she is so unappreciative of the things Mildred gets and does for her. The story goes on and on to a certain extent, so I won't bore anyone with the excesses.<br /><br />I feel that this movie is one that must be in everyone's movie library. The flip side of the disc contains the documentary about Joan, which is excellent to see. The acting is brilliant, and the quality of the picture and sound is very sharp, for a movie released in the '40s. Pick this classic up while you still can.

B005LAIHXQ|1.0|I have seen the movie at the theater during opening day and this review is solely based on the film, not the DVD package.<br /><br />The movie had great acting and stunning visuals but the writing and storytelling is absolute crap. There are so many stupid elements in the story of Prometheus that in my opinion, it's not even worth owning on DVD, unless you're a special effects guru/fan of sci-fi films.  The sets and the ship are amazing, but as I've said, what ruins the film is the story; without revealing any spoilers you see dumb scientists doing dumb things, a huge disappointment of a film.

B001TH16DI|4.0|I not only like to have these extra documentaries for reference, but I'm also a bit OCD and when I upgrade I hate to lose anything from previous formats.  I bought this on sale at Amazon and felt it was worthwhile to go from DVD to BD because of the sale price.<br /><br />I previously had the box set of Original Trek movies containing these six films in the two-disc versions (Collector's or Director's Editions).  I was very interested to see if the BluRay set had everything from the DVD set.<br /><br />First, some good news.  Each of the BD versions has at least one (often more) Bonus Features, in HiDef, which were not on the DVD versions.<br /><br />Next, bad news.  Film I had three BFs on the DVD version which were not included on the BD version.  Also the DVD version was the Extended Cut and the BD was not, nor were there Deleted Scenes on the BD version.  Similar issue for film II -- Director's Cut on DVD but not on BD and no Deleted Scenes (though the BD did have all the BFs from the DVD).<br /><br />More good news.  Films III through VI were not missing any BFs from the DVDs and they all (IIRC) had Deleted Scenes (though I don't remember the DVD versions being Extended or Director's Cuts anyway).<br /><br />More bad news.  All of the DVD versions had a Text Commentary track from the Okudas.  This is a version of the film with popup boxes from time to time with tidbits of info.  I like these text commentaries over audio commentaries because you can watch and listen to the film while still getting extra info.  With audio commentaries, you mostly can't hear the film dialog so you either listen to the film with no commentary or you listen to commentary.  All of the DVD versions had this text commentary but none of the BD versions did (that I could find).<br /><br />So, to sum up -- the BD set has more Bonus Features than the DVD set, but is missing a few BFs and some scenes that were available on the DVD set.  The BD set is also missing the text commentaries fromthe Okudas.<br /><br />And so my end rating is four stars.  The film quality itself is good enough to allow for five stars, so any adjustments I make are based on features.  Although I get some extras here not on DVD, I'm missing others, and my OCD won't let me give five stars for not completely superseding the previous format.

B005LAII3U|1.0|The acting was mediocre. In one scene I even felt an actor was having difficulty with his lines and that's annoying! What's even more annoying is that the main \\"bad guy\\" is a depraved, Teflon-coated, wonder woman who can easily beat the stuffing out of our hero, despite the fact he also happens to be a professionally trained killer with muscles the size of bowling balls. Throughout the entire movie, this wonder woman just keeps coming back like a pesty stalker. Hardly getting a scratch until the very end. I was even waiting for her to start talking like Clint Eastwood! She also enjoyed explaining herself too much and I was really hoping she would get dispatched ASAP because her presence was undermining the entire story!<br /><br />I have to admit I cared about the good guys! I wanted them to win, but unlike the first Total Recall, I didn't care nearly as much. In the original film I desperately wanted the good guys to win! In the remake my feelings were muted. After all the remake has been dumbed-down, which makes it dull. Sure there's plenty of CGI eye candy and plenty of Clone Trooper-type guys in body armor getting miraculously mowed down at every corner. But the story is not edgy in the least! Unlike the original Total Recall, where you really didn't know if the good guys were going to win.<br /><br />And the remake has no message, unlike the original. The original was about mind-bogglingly oppressive corporate greed and as a result you felt a wide range of strong emotions! So much was a stake!<br /><br />I don't like it when a great story is reduced to so many campy cliches! There was great tension building in the first half of the film only to fall apart later! It's so obvious Hollywood focus-grouped the screenplay to death in order to pander to the teen and pre-teen boy segment of the movie going public! Too bad Philip K. Dick will be spinning in his grave tonight. Whoever owns the film rights to his stories should be ashamed of themselves and PLEASE make no more movies if this is the best you can do!

It wasn't what I was expecting at all, but then again not sure what I was expecting..<br />You wouldn't believe the smile  that came across my face when I realized what \\"slam\\" was!! I have quite a bit of poetry I wrote in my younger years, and could totally see myself sitting with Will, Lake, Eddie & Gavin, listening or participating in slam!<br />This book is heartwarming, touching, funny & full of life lessons we all sometimes need to be reminded of!!  Colleen Hoover created an excellent debut novel!!  The story line was full of twists & turns that kept me up late at night, wanting for more of Will & Lake!  I absolutely was smitten with Will's character! He was fun & charming, then responsible and sacrificial when he needed to be!<br />Layken appeared much older than 18 at times, but I guess that was due to dealing with the death of her father.<br />What more can I say without giving too much away!!<br />It was an awesome read that I will probably re-read very soon! I totally connected with the characters and miss being a part of their adventures!

0312330537|5.0|Listened to the whole thing on audio. (Humphrey Bower is a great reader; sounds like Roberts.) I was sorry it ended. Frankly, I could have gone on reading it forever.  Only problem: to whom should I bequeath these thirty-five precious CD's? I would love to meet the author one day, but must be satisfied seeing bits of him on YouTube.  Strange: he was a gangster and an escaped felon, but his humanitarian values are impeccable.  This is something of a confessional novel.  Perhaps his most singular and bracing quality is his honesty.  We should all be so forthcoming about our character defects and missteps.  He rarely excuses himself, but he more than makes up for his criminal life with this forthcoming masterpiece.  I have only one major criticism of a vivid and entertaining work of art: the somewhat embarrassing descriptions of his dysfunctional love life.  When describing Karla and Lisa he rockets off on flights of irritatingly flowery prose he should have excised in this otherwise brilliant song of India.

006197806X|4.0|3.5. Not as good as book 1, but I understand new characters have to be developed. I didn't like the chapters \\"then\\" and \\"now\\" every other chapter. I like when the story flows all the way through. I have some \\"silly\\" questions, but I have to remind myself this book is for teens. Other than that, it was another easy, good read. I don't think it needed to be quite as long as it was and wish more things developed in all those pages, but am hoping the last book ties it all neatly together. And I can't believe I have to wait until March 2013 (esp the way it ended)! CRAP!

I'm hoping it doesn't throw in another male character like the other 2 trilogies out, but I have a feeling....  It kept me hooked; I loved the characters; the story kept moving; lots of action and great love story. And I can't wait to get the second one!
009193768X|5.0|With its' distinctive \\"eau de nil\\" (water of the nile) blue-green cover and subtle gold lettering, this little book not only traces the history of taking tea, but also the history of Fortum & Mason.  There are wonderful recipes like plum and almond tartlets and exquisitely photographed pages with beautiful china plates and tea cups.<br /><br />One interesting fact for Americans is that after the Boston Tea Party in 1773, Fortum & Mason continued to ship its tea to North America to both \\"Loyalists and Republicans alike\\".  Even a war could not stop the Americans love of tea as tea symbolized wealth and status.<br /><br />Fortnum & Mason has long been connected to the Royal Family and in March 2012, Queen Elizabeth II, the Dutchess of Cornwall (Camilla), and the Dutchess of Cambridge (Kate Middleton), spent the day at Fortnums sampling treats and inspecting the Fortnum tins of food being sent to the troops abroad.  The Queen even wore a matching eau de nil suit.  All of this adds to the ambiance of Fortum & Mason as a luxury store which still holds royal warrants as far back as Queen Anne and remains today as the \\"grocers, provisions merchants and tea merchants\\" to the Royal household. This book would make a marvelous gift for anyone interested in the history of tea, recipes for delicious tea treats and in the history of a famous store that has been in London's Piccadilly since 1707.
034580404X|5.0|My wife loves these books, she's reading them for the third time!  She wanted all three, so I bought the \\"trilogy\\" set.

The boxed set comes in a paperboard case, which you essentially get for free by buying all three books at once.
B000001FKY|5.0|It is the favorite of many fans, including myself.  And with good reason.<br /><br />This is one of the best rock albums ever.  I first loved it when I was 11 years old.  It had already been out for more than a year, but was still getting a lot of attention and exposure on radio and MTV.  I asked my parents to get the tape for me and they did.  I also got some other DL albums, but this one remained my favorite.  I didn't understand all the lyrics but that didn't matter.  The music was awesome.  To this day, this album has a unique sound to it that keeps it from sounding dated.  Lots of hooks, melodies, soaring guitars, thundering drums, and 80s hair metal fun.<br /><br />Highlights are, of course, the singles, but the album tracks are just as good (with the exception of \\"Excitable\\", which is my least favorite track on it).  \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\" and \\"Love Bites\\" grew on me over time.  \\"Animal\\", \\"Hysteria\\", \\"Rocket\\", and \\"Armageddon It\\" were early favorites of mine.  \\"Love & Affection\\", \\"Run Riot\\", and \\"Gods of War\\" are catchy and memorable.  I tend to go through phases with favorite tracks throughout the years.  My personal favorite is still always \\"Armageddon It\\", though.  I remember hearing it on the radio in 1988 and playing it on my tape over and over.  The guitar solo in it is one of my favorites of all-time.  I never get tired of it.<br /><br />Today marks the 25th anniversary of this album.  Yes, August 3, 1987.  25 years already.  It's hard to believe that I've been familiar with it for 24 years.  It is a part of my childhood.  The album holds up well, still sounds fresh.  The album took a few years for them to make, and they were trying to make the Thriller of metal/hard rock.  They succeeded.  It really is.  Anybody who enjoys rock music should own this.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|I'm reluctant to post reviews slamming books - I realise people have different tastes.<br />However, for this book I'll make a special exception.<br />The quality of the writing here is so bad, it beggars belief that anyone would bother to publish it.  Let alone that it could become a bestseller.<br />The author repeats the same juvenile ideas and phrases over and over and over... I would think even a 14-year-old who this was written for would find that boring and insulting.
0439023491|2.0|This trilogy was recommended to me by some very intelligent people in my own age bracket (late 20s-early 30s), so I decided to give it a try. I liked Book 1 okay. It was a fast read and I kept turning pages to find out what happened to Katniss and Peeta (even though Peeta was kind of a pansy).<br /><br />Book 2 starts off pretty slow. One of the hardest things about writing fiction is knowing what to narrate quickly in paragraph form, and what to flesh out into actual scenes with action and dialogue. The author is spectacularly bad at this in Book 2. Important scenes (like Katniss' first meeting with Gale after she gets home, and Peeta's marriage proposal), are just glossed over and explained in 1 paragraph. Then, boring details like Katniss trying on all her wedding gowns take up many pages. The love triangle is becoming juvenile and dumb. We don't understand why Katniss cares about Gale, since he is a secondary character that the reader barely gets to know.<br /><br />(*Spoilers*) I was hanging in there even after it was announced that Peeta and Katniss had to return to the arena. When all of the old victors got together and started training, I thought that the book was finally going to take off. The victors were going to band together and defy the Capitol. I was waiting for an awesome showdown that ignited a rebellion. When the tributes just started killing each other like it was a regular Hunger Games, I wanted to throw the book across the room. This second Hunger Games plays out exactly as the first, almost word for word! Again we have the fancy clothes and make-up, the chariot rides, the interviews, and an arena only slightly different than the first. Again, most of the tributes are faceless throwaway characters that are killed \\"off-camera\\" so Katniss does not have to deal with them. Katniss and friends continue getting gifts parachuted in instead of having to survive by their own devices. There's not even much hunger this time, since there is plenty in the arena to eat. I can't believe the author just rehashed the original plot and thought we readers would buy it!<br /><br />The book leaves the reader with many questions that are never answered.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book is AWFUL.  At the beginning of the book the sex was hot, but even that got boring towards the end.  The main characters are not at all likable.  I felt like I was reading a silly teenager's diary.<br /><br />1. For a \\"brainy\\", literature student, who makes several references to her high GPA, Anastasia Steele comes off as an idiot.  She ought to be intelligent enough to realize that Christian Grey is a, moody, abusive, control freak.  He's allowed to do all sorts of debasing things to her, but she can't even touch his chest or stroke his cheek.  Ana has to call him \\"Sir\\" or \\"Mr. Grey\\" even after they had sex 6 times in one day.  He spanks her if she rolls her eyes at him.  It shouldn't matter how \\"beautiful\\", \\"hot\\", or wealthy the guy is.  Another annoying thing about the book is that Ana says \\"holy f---\\" often.  Can't she come up with more creative phrases if she is purportedly an avid reader?<br />2.  Her sassy \\"inner goddess\\" and judgmental \\"subconscious\\" are irritating.<br />3. Christian Grey is a 28 year billionaire.  Not millionaire.  A billionaire.  Think about it.  His net worth is over 1,000 million dollars!  E.L. James does not give any information about how a 28 year old becomes head of large corporation - especially a 28 year old with serious emotional issues.  It would be more credible if he was a tech geek like Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook or Larry Page of Google.<br />4.  If you choose to read this book, you will get very tired of reading about Ana biting her lip, her whispering shyly, people murmuring, Christian growling,...<br /><br />Don't waste your time!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is my first review.  I felt compelled to write it after finishing Wool 1-5 & 6.<br /><br />I'm sorry I have to say this, but if you are looking for a deeply depressing, dark, ugly book, Wool is the series for you!  And bonus points if you're a Democrat, according to Howey we're responsible for the end of the world.  Woot!!<br /><br />A word of warning though:  This is not SCIENCE fiction.  It's social fiction about the ugliest dystopia a disturbed mind could ever think of.  If you buy it expecting to find science, you will be deeply disappointed.  As I was.  There is mention of a nanotech plague in book 6, but it's more figurative than described in any detail.<br /><br />Wool is great stuff if you want to be depressed, to examine the ugliest side imaginable of humanity, to wallow in hopeless misery of being trapped in an underground prison where the only escape is death (granted, there is one exception).  Lock up that gun though, you might have an urge to see what bullet tastes like, just to stop the misery while reading this book!<br /><br />Howey is a skilled writer though, he does weave a somewhat interesting tale with good character development.  That's about the only positive thing I can think of to say about this series.<br /><br />I came to Wool through the high reader ratings and thought I'd give it a try.  Having being sucked in, I even purchased and read #6.  But I'm done.  The sky is blue, my kids are happy, life is still good.  I feel so much better now I've stopped reading the sad tale.<br /><br />Frankly, I'm amazed the series garnered such high reviews.  It makes me think that either the Amazon ratings system is rigged or the human condition is much worse off than I ever imagined.<br /><br />Unfortunately I happened to read this series while on my family vacation in Fiji, and my memories of my kids playing on the beach will forever be tainted by Wool.<br /><br />However, if you're the obsessively depressive type, I you will absolutely LOVE this book.  For that reason, and the irony of joining the crowd in awarding this book with such a high rating and join in perverting the system, I award this book 5-stars.<br /><br />So with that, congratulations for reading an actually honest review of the book.  Those who disputes this review are probably either dystopia fans, lovers of deep melancholy, the chronically depressed, or fanboys looking to mislead others.  Or probably some combination.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review.  I hope you've been convinced to move on, there are far better books to read.  I wish I could get my money (and my vacation) back...
B007C4ZJ0S|3.0|A great deal is made of Gina Carano's prowess as a mixed martial arts \\"superstar\\" and very little about her suitability as an actress.  That she did her own stunts is less impressive because it is to be expected from someone with her background.  Casting her in a feature film where she's allowed to utilize her expertise and not much else is nothing short of a gimmick.  This project was fabricated solely to showcase her talent.  It was populated with no less than six \\"names\\" in bit parts to help give her and this film some credibility.  The story is paper thin and easily summed up in a single sentence with the tagline: why bother.<br /><br />I was not impressed.<br />The problem with this film is that the person with the most screen time should have been allotted the least.  When Carano isn't beating the crap out of someone, the film stalls.  She has no charisma, no natural charm, she doesn't evoke mystery; she simply stands there and recites her lines by rote.  A lamppost could spark more interest.  It was annoying how little effort she put into the non-action sequences.  Not that she was entirely to blame; this movie was little more than a bunch of fight scenes strung together.  Nothing about this movie surprised me.  In the end, I was glad I checked it out of the library rather than waste any money on it.<br /><br />I won't say it was the worst action flick I'd ever seen, it would have had to work a lot harder to gain that distinction.  Instead, it was merely all right..............and blessedly short.
B002WYJHBA|5.0|Who can watch those Leave It To Beaver type shows, see how everything always works out, and not crave some part of that?  Although Toby Maguire is the lead I think it's Jeff Daniels who sells it best.
B00004RJ71|5.0|I love this movie! It is one of my all time favorites. I just dont like the directors cut because I dont speak spanish and there arent subtitles like the original cut I have seen. I would strongly recommend this movies to anyone.
B003Y5H59C|5.0|I have always been a fan of Spader, not so much of Gyllenhaal (either of them), but this movie was excellent.  Whatever inspiration Gyllenhaal tapped into to get this performance she should always do.

B002UZCJP2|5.0|I have always been a fan of Bruce Willis and scifi and this movie does not disappoint. It is more cerebral than action so don't expect the thrill-a-minute Bruce Willis movie.
B008MZU8R0|5.0|The 7:20 of \\"Headlong Flight\\" is worth the full retail price of the album.  The instrumental break with its little vocal intro, \\"oh, I wish that I could live it all again,\\" at 3:50 gives me chills every time.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have never written a review before.  However, I felt compelled to do so in this case. I borrowed Fifty Shades of Grey from a friend and it took me almost a week to get through it.  The writing was very poor, the characters and story seem straight out of the Twilight series.  The main female character, Ana pushes too far to fast.  And she act like she is twelve, she keeps referring to him in her head with her full name.  The sex scenes are laughable.  I have read much better short stories with more developed characters and better sex scenes.

B008CP93S0|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Did I watch it to the end?  Well yes, I like my endings, but I fast fowarded it through about 20 minutes.  It's not that it was too vulgar or that I am a prude.  It is just a really bad movie.  I like the actors, just not this movie.

B004SIP9B0|5.0|Just as every American knows where they were on 9/11, every Brit knows what they were doing when the news came in that Princess Diana had been killed in a car accident in Paris. Heck, I was a thirteen year old New Zealander and I still remember running home from my grandmother's house (having seen the news report on television) to tell my parents what had occurred. It was a shocking, confusing, upsetting time, and for anyone who remembers the media circus in the wake of the princess's death, \\"The Queen\\" provides a fascinating look at what might have been going on among those who were affected by it most.<br /><br />In 1997 the British public elected in a new Prime Minister by a landslide majority; he was Tony Blair - young, popular, and with republican sympathies. In many ways he was the polar opposite of Queen Elizabeth II in nearly every respect, and their initial relationship (at least as it's depicted here) was rather cool. Yet not long after Blair officially accepts the position, a much greater news story sweeps the country: Princess Diana has been killed in a car accident. Yet her death is just the background for the central dynamic of the film: the tentative alliance that forms between Blair and the Queen, and the questions that arise surrounding the nature of grief, and how it should be displayed.<br /><br />As the public begin to grieve their loss, they grow increasingly frustrated by the silence emitting from the royal family. Though the Queen insists that she must attend to her grandchildren and maintain dignity by not indulging the media, the public clamors for a more shared display of regret. They want flags flying at half-mast without understanding the protocol behind it. They want televised eulogies from every minister, celebrity and royal family member in existence. They demand that the Queen \\"lead the people in grief\\", whatever that means. They gather en-masse at the gates of Buckingham Palace to light candles and lay flowers for a woman they'd never even met.<br /><br />The Queen is baffled by it all, stating: \\"we do things quietly in this country, and with dignity,\\" but in doing so, seriously misreads the mood of her people. Blair on the other hand, steps up to the plate, coins the term \\"the people's princess\\" in his eulogy and increases his own popularity. Witnessing the growing antipathy toward the Queen, he tries to advise her to address her people, only to be met with stubbornness and pride. Something has to give, and Blair knows that the longer it takes for the Queen to make a public statement, the more it will seem as though she's simply bowing to public pressure.<br /><br />At the time it all happened, I really had no idea of the furor surrounding the actions (or inactions) of the royal family until much later after the event. Only by watching this film did I really begin to grasp the circumstances of that time. One suspects that most of the frenzy was whipped up by the media who needed a scapegoat for - if not Diana's death - than at least the aftermath, but the royals' inability to judge the needs/wants of the people was a serious oversight on their behalf. The film shows remarkable restraint in providing an impartial look at the events of those sad weeks, presenting the backstage events as they (may have) occurred, and thus allowing the audience to reach their own conclusions as to what should have happened regarding the public and the palace.<br /><br />The film concentrates mainly on the relationship between Tony Blair and Queen Elizabeth, specifically Blair's changing attitude toward the Queen; initially finding all the pomp and circumstance rather silly, getting immensely frustrated with the lack of cooperation from the palace, and finally delivering a final impassioned speech in the Queen's defense that is the closest the film gets to taking a side in the whole affair. (And as the Queen astutely points out afterwards, the reason Blair is so sympathetic to her plight is that he knows all too well that the public could turn on him just as easily - as indeed they did ten years later in the wake of the war on Iraq).<br /><br />Helen Mirren won the Oscar that year for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth, and it's not difficult to see why. Capturing the mannerisms and speech patterns of the Queen without making it look as though she's trying too hard, Mirren presents a woman who is both strong and fragile, determined yet easily-led, wise in certain circumstances but foolish in others, witty and yet detached - in other words, a fully formed woman struggling with a PR challenge that she can't fully understand. There's a lovely moment in which the Queen is by herself out in the countryside (her car just having broken down) and she's facing away from the camera, allowing herself to cry over the ordeal for the first time. We're not sure why - is it for Diana? For the way she's been treated by the public? But whatever the reason, she eventually composes herself, and her face resettles into its dour \\"game face\\". Right in front of your eyes she goes from a woman to a Queen.<br /><br />Michael Sheen (who has played Tony Blair twice before in [[ASIN:B0010X73Z6 The Deal]] and [[ASIN:B003N9ASF2 The Special Relationship]]) is clearly quite at home playing this particular character, and James Cromwell provides quite a scathing rendition of the boorish, thick-headed Prince Philip, whose main contribution to events is to give his wife consistently bad advice. Alex Jennings is a nervy but surprisingly sympathetic Prince Charles and Sylvia Syms gets some of the best lines as the Queen Mother (\\"nobody tells me anything,\\" she snipes at one point). Wisely, Princes William and Harry are out-of-focus for the entirety of the film, appearing only from behind or from a distance. It's a respectful portrayal of the two individuals who were undoubtedly hurt the most by this entire ordeal, and director Steven Frears is mindful of their privacy.<br /><br />Speaking of whom, the real fascination with this film is how director Steven Frears and writer Peter Morgan manage to make it so darn interesting. Considering all it really involves is various people watching news reports, discussing things in conference rooms, attending press conferences and uncertainly moving from one place to the next, it's quite remarkable that the whole thing remains so rivetingly fast-paced (ironically, their shared DVD commentary is deathly boring). Replicating speeches that were said and outfits that were worn, as well as using stock footage and newsreels that aired at the time, all provide a sense of authenticity and immediacy. Little bits of trivia are peppered throughout (the Queen cannot vote; she was a mechanic in wartime) and though some segments can feel a bit heavy-handed (the symbolism surrounding that stag!) it remains a film that's fundamentally about topics not many people can resist: the lives that go on behind closed doors, the one-sided relationship that exist between leaders and followers, the frenzy of gossip and the media, the manipulative tactics of public relations, and of course - those royals.<br /><br />As a companion piece, try following this up with the identically named docu-drama [[ASIN:B00342ANSA The Queen]], which explores more of the challenges that Queen Elizabeth has faced during her reign.ll that the public could turn on him just as easily - as indeed they did ten years later in the wake of the war on Iraq).<br /><br />Helen Mirren won the Oscar that year for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth, and it's not difficult to see why.

B00785P2QC|5.0|this game is fun and it doesn't get boring you get to decide on your own and make it how you want it I play it every day because its so exciting to see what is next I give it 5stars.
B0002J4X1Q|5.0|We have enjoyed playing the video games.  We enjoy watching the movies, too.  Even my kids like to watch zombie movies.  I like to spend time with my oldest daughter watching movies and this is one she picked out.
B004Q7E0TA|5.0|I usually do not read real life stories, however, after watching an interview on Ellen I decided to buy this book and I am really happy I did. This story was so real, I could almost feel the pain coming off the pages while I read it. It followed Portia's life as she went from an Australian model to an American actress and all her struggles in between with her weight and knowing herself. It was so sad and yet enlightening to read. I really do recommend this to anyone, especially someone going through a time in life where they are unsure of themselves. I just loved this so much!!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I love this book, I read it in a day and started it again, I won't compare it to 50 shades but it's good in its own way.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love this game. its great for the kids and for people like me who like angry birds or any games.
0307959856|5.0|4.5 stars.  I may be in the minority, but I loved this book!  Perhaps it is because this is the first PD James book I have read (I have plenty of her other books here on my shelves, just haven't gotten to them yet).  I don't normally go for \\"fan fiction\\" at all (I rather dislike it, to be honest), but James is true to Austen, true to the characters.  While I never once felt like I could be reading Austen's work here, I don't think that was the intention.<br /><br />The mystery is cute and of course involves the irritating Wickham and Lydia.  All of Austen's Pride & Prejudice characters either make an appearance or merit a mention and the entire experience, I felt, was immensely satisfying.  All in all, I'm glad this is the first James book I've read.  If this little book was this good, I can't wait to read her famous mysteries!
030758836X|3.0|This was my first Flynn book. I thoroughly enjoyed this book until the end. Are you serious? What a lazy ending! Very disappointed and I hope her other works don't end the same.

B007ZBWJXI|5.0|\\"XXX\\" is the brand new 12th studio album by legendary prog/melodic rock group \\"Asia\\". \\"XXX\\" is the third album since the band reformed under the original line up of John Wetton (v,b), Geoff Downes (k), Steve Howe (g) and Carl Palmer (d) - also marking their third studio release under Frontiers Records.<br /><br />Much like its predecessor \\"Omega\\", the new album explores the straightforward melodic rock/AOR sound of \\"Asia\\" which was introduced on their second album \\"Alpha\\". As expected, the songwriting is based on a multitude of keyboard melodies and supporting harmonies, robust bass lines setting the tone of each song, the guitar leads and colorful rhythm parts of Howe and Plamer's inventive selection of patterns all making the material so unmistakably \\"Asia\\". One has to mention that Wetton's vocals are also in prime form, thus all elements seem in place for another great \\"Asia\\" studio offering.<br /><br />\\"XXX\\" opens on the intense and pompous \\"Tomorrow the Word\\", followed by the melodic \\"Buy Me a Willow\\", the protestant \\"No Religion\\", the sweet- sugary \\"Faithful\\", the reflective/dramatic \\"I know how you feel\\" and the slick \\"Al Gatto Nero\\". Indeed it is melodic rock highlight after melodic rock highlight for this quarter making \\"XXX\\" easily one of the most cohesive \\"Asia\\" albums to date, engaging the listener into a barrage of AOR highlights. There is no filler on \\"XXX\\" while at the same time there is no surprise in store for the experienced fan; it is \\"Asia\\" doing what they do best playing first rate melodic rock with an underline of prog.

B008J05EL8|1.0|Charging your customers four ninety-nine for a font package that should have been a part of the app is just plain greedy.  I will never buy anything from this developer again. Good luck getting new customers with your greedy business strategy.
B005DC68NI|5.0|I'm going to make this review short and sweet: 'Let's Get Digital' is a helpful guide for any of you out there trying to make the decision between querying for a book deal or going out on your own and self-publishing. David Gaughran obviously knows his stuff, as to why self-publishing via kindle is the way of the future (he even has the stats to back up his claims) to plenty of success stories from his fellow self-publishers. Buy the book. It will guide you step-by-step, right up to formatting and finding someone to sketch out some professional cover art. This book has everything you need to navigate the waters of self-publication.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|my 3yr old loves this game. the only downfall is that it takes so long to do anything. guess it'll teach us patience. it would be cool if they gave little facts about the critters
B003YL4LYI|1.0|I invested my time and money in all 5 books, only to have the characters I cared about, killed or thought so and rarely heard from again.<br />  Storylines were not completed and ended with someone killing the ones in power and taking over, that you never knew was alive. BOO, HISS<br />  The first 3 books were good, the next 2 were not
B008B37CB8|4.0|Did anyone buy this 2012 reissue yet?<br />Is it the same as the RYKO CD?<br />or is it more like the original LP?
B000AYEL6U|5.0|From the first time seeing this movie I was in love. The characters of Margaret Hale and John Thornton are intriguing and wonderful to see. The music is perhaps my favorite part of the movie. I am a huge fan of Martin Phipps and it is sad to see that not many of the movies for whom he composes have available soundtracks. North & South is a beautiful story of a young woman whose father moves the family to a northern town in England where she is confronted with the many differences between her former home and where she now finds herself living. At first she sees Milton as a cruel, cold and harsh place filled with money-loving people who care nothing for the workers in their workshops. But as her friendship with one of these men progresses, she is able to see some of the beauty of the town, and she begins to understand the character of the man she first knew to be unworthy of her friendliness.<br />I highly recommend this movie for anyone who appreciates a good plot, gorgeous scenery, and the sweet romance that blooms between the two main characters. It is a movie worth watching.
B0086700CM|5.0|I play it all the time I'm addicted to this game. If I could I would play this game all the time.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|This isn't as close to the book as I would have liked, but was an acceptable deviation from it. It kind of combines Princess of Mars, with God's of Mars, though of course the Thern involvement is 90% different than the books. Kind of weird that Deja is a scientist! But I didn't read the books and didn't watch the movies because of her, but because of John Carter and Burrough's Mars.<br />Strange that it didnt do better in the theaters, which means probably no future installments. It is a very enjoyable Sci-Fi/Fantasy action movie.<br />UPDATE; I see that many more reviews have been added since I first wrote mine and the average score has increased. Its funny that this did so 'poorly' in the theaters. Hopefully the filmmakers will see that its really a popular movie after all and reconsider a sequel. Maybe if they didn't only define 'success' as what makes them a fortune. If a movie pays for itself after a year (I don't really know if this one has) and also provides a modest profit, why wouldn't that be good enough? Studios should be in the business because they want to serve the public in this way, not just for piles of profit.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love ttlhis game it is very addiicting and gives u something to do when u are bored. I. am very happy that I got this games and u should get it too.

1469984202|4.0|I believe this is one of those books that I would've found to be much better if I had read it a little faster. The storyline was great and the writing was great. The book is actually broken down into 5 books, the first book I really liked and left a cliffhanger at the end that prompted me to buy the collection and I have to say I was a bit disappointed reading the 2nd book which is probably why my reading slowed down, I was so bored with the 2nd book but then the 3rd book started and I was sucked back in.<br /><br />This about life in silo. An underground silo. If you are sent to 'clean', you are being put to death. You can't even talk about the outside. Those in charge are ruthless.<br /><br />I'm trying to word this review without including any spoilers but I can't. I don't even want to talk about 1 specific person without giving away too much so you'll have to read this -like no other- book for yourself and draw your own conclusion!
B008GXHOFW|1.0|I could go on about how many things in this game are bad. But for now I'll just make a short list.<br /><br />- first of all, the graphics are not that great<br /><br />- the game always lags and there are tons of glitches<br /><br />- every time I play the game for longer than 15-20 minutes it freezes, shuts down, and crashes my whole kindle. Making me loose all of my progress and I have to start the game all over again. (And this has happened many times)<br /><br />- Finally,  !!!SEVEN BUCKS FOR THIS CRAP!!! REALLY GAMELOFT, REALLY !!!<br /><br />This game is a waste of money and time. Don't buy it.

1250004217|5.0|Julia Jarmond, an American Journalist living in Paris, is asked by her boss, Joshua, to report on a roundup of Jews sixty years earlier on July 16th,1942. Thousands of Jewish parents and children were arrested by French policemen, by orders from the Gestapo with the approval of the French government. The Jews were first held in a Parisian building, the Vel' d Hiv but eventually transported to Auschwitz where most of them died.<br /><br />Julia learns that an apartment her French husband, Bertand is remodeling for them to live in was once inhabited by a young Jewish family with a daughter, Sarah and a son Michel. As the police arrest the family, Sarah hides 4 year old Michel in a secret room and promises to return for him. She hides the room key in her pocket.<br /><br />Julia's research fuels a strange determination to find Sarah if possible. She also discovers that few French citizens remember the shameful events of that day.<br /><br />Meanwhile Julia's marriage to Bertrand becomes strained because of unexpected events. She slowly learns of his families secrets that especially affected the older generation, whom she loves.<br /><br />The book chapters alternate between Sarah's story and Julia's until the time when Sarah disappears. Readers will hope and wonder if Sarah rescued her four-year old brother from the secret room and if Julia will ever learn the full story.<br /><br /> Every one needs to remember the terrible events of those holocaust years.

0375869026|5.0|It was by luck that I came across this book. Apparently ALA lists this as a good audio-recording for young listeners. I wasn't able to get it on CD, and I'm glad that I ended up reading the actual book. I didn't even use the restroom until I'd finished reading! Not exaggerating. Half of it is told from the main character's point-of-view, while other people will also have their side of the story included. The author is skilled at giving each individual a unique voice and background. From an educator's perspective, I like that this book is very readable for elementary children without it sounding simple and juvenile. I will be buying this book for my 4/5 classroom!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|pretty good games. however it would be better if there were some instructions. I still haven't figured out some of the games
0061692042|5.0|Count me as one that is a little surprised by the negative reaction of some to Ford's latest novel. I'm chalking this up to the possibility that the Bascombe series caters to a different part of the Ford persona, and that those readers that come from Independence Day to Canada are disappointed by the \\"other\\" Richard Ford. The easiest transition would have been from the first novel, A Piece of My Heart, or the brilliant short stories of Rock Springs.<br /><br />I will also disagree with those who believe that Frank Bascombe was a more hopeful figure than Dell Parsons. They are both quintessential Ford people. Dell experiences more severe headwinds which are the plot elements that make this a significant work for galvanizing the author's feelings concerning the importance of maintaining a pragmatic balance in solving the puzzle of life. This is the central theme of Canada. You could certainly argue that the real Dell may not have fared as well as the fictional one, but this is a novel, which is always a work of the imagination created for the purpose of sharing ideas about human interaction and circumstance.<br /><br />I've always found Ford easy to read. The cadence of his prose appeals to me in a  personal way with characters that have depth and nobility. He has always displayed a certain callous edge to what are otherwise compassionate protagonists, meaning that highly charged emotional episodes can be accurately observed as significant events followed by a philosophical interlude in which the character regains perspective, becomes pragmatic, forms a strategy for survival. If understated, Ford expects the reader to infer the pain, rejection, loss, and misery with the understanding that the goal is to overcome, focus on the situation at hand, and try to move on. He uses Berner as the example of what happens to really good people every day when they lose hope and Dell as the example of one who could put the past and it's harrowing tale of abandonment behind. The factthat the siblings are twins indicates that Ford clearly understands the thin line that separates these perspectives.<br /><br />I really cannot say more without revealing plot, but from a prose point of view, Richard Ford is at the top of his game. He still has a lot to say, and I'm listening.
B007X4ECLY|4.0|What we have here folks is a future cult classic.  This is the type of film schwarzenegger would have felt right at home in.  I have to say Guy does a great job in the role of Snow.  You could tell he was in on the joke, he did everything but wink at the camera.  I enjoyed everything about the film except for a poor CG chase scene.  It was a terrible sequence and should have been left on the cutting room floor.  Other than that this film had it all, great one liners, great action and even a little romance.  I can't believe I'm going to say this but I enjoyed it a lot more than Prometheus.  This film will fit nicely on my shelf next to Soldier, Total Recall and Escape from New York

B007VLHP9K|5.0|Finally, after a long wait, Sony has put to brucknerophiles these great editions of the symphonies 6 to 8, and as a great bonus the audio of fourth symphony. Impossible to miss this great box (and with good price). The seventh, a summit in symphonic music, is played with pride and depth of the conductor and orchestra. The end of the first movement, with the Celibidache voice is unique! The bonus is tremendous: With almost 80 minutes Celibidache makes a majestic, quasi infinite reading of this masterpiece. Some think it's very slow and long, but this symphony, like all good things of life should be savored without worrying about time!
0785152458|1.0|So i bought this comic unknowing that there was a spinoff hit girl comic that they recommend that you read first. Only problem is hit girl is not available in hardback so i do not have access to it because i buy all my comics in hardcover. and the end of this book say that there will be 5 parts to the story.<br /><br />swell Mark Millar I would love to read part 2 but quite frankly i cant and until i do i will not be reading any more because i feel like i missed something that may explain all the crazy that hapened in this book.<br /><br />The book felt rushed and it leapfrogged a few stories that never got explained.
B003Y5D776|5.0|I do a bit of online gaming on my iMac, and needed a device that provided a microphone interface (the iMac I have doesn't have a microphone jack). Pretty much every recommendation I received was to get a USB sound card, and I tried 2 before I settled on this one. The problems with the ones I tried were that after an hour or so, people on ventrilo would complain that my voice sounded robotic and garbled. This would last a minute or so, and then things would go back to normal. After some research, this seemed to be a long known problem on the mac. One of the websites recommended using the iMic, as it was reported not to have this issue. So far, for me, this has been true (maybe around 10 hours online so far, so would assume it would have happened by now).<br /><br />The sound produced by this device is very clean, and I have no complaints with the quality. I believe it's stereo only, not simulated surround. But it is sufficient for my needs.<br /><br />I have no idea why the iMic works, and the previous USB sound devices I tried didn't. But that indeed seems to be the case. So if you were having the same problems I was having, you might want to give this device a try.
B003K1EYM6|4.0|I almost gave this thing away when I found that it would not work with my New iPad (3rd Gen) and USB flash drives, or with CF Card Readers. It also failed with several SD cards with an indication of too much power required. I then discovered that it does two things very well: Retrieving photos (even RAW format) and videos via USB directly from my Canon EOS 7d to my iPad, and transferring videos and photos from my iPhone 4 to my iPad. It allows me to select the photos and videos that I want to transfer and my iPad displays them (even the RAW Canon images) in all their glory. It does the same for images and videos on my Sony Cyber-shot HX30V when a micro-USB cable is substituted for the mini-USB cable, and does so without the compression loss of Sony's Play Memories Wi-Fi app. The second connector that is supposed to read SD cards is worthless since the iOS upgrade that limited power to external devices. Bottom line is that this kit only works with self-powered devices, but is so handy to use with my EOS 7D, Sony HX30V and iPhone that I'm glad I did not give up on it. I'm told that it works with most other Canon and Nikon cameras, but you need to read more reviews to find out if it works with yours.
0307341577|5.0|I could not put this book down.  I was going to take it on vacation and started it a couple days before my trip.  On the second day, I sat for a couple hours in the afternoon, just devouring it until I was finished.  The character development is great, the plot keeps you guessing till the last few pages, and it is just an extraordinary trip!  Unfortunately, I will have to find something else to read on vacation now, and it surely will not be as good as this book was.

B004DI7HZ6|2.0|I am at the 52% point, reading on Kindle. If I finish the book, I will amend my review. Daughter says that the full read felt, ultimately, worthwhile for her which was enough provocation for me to download it, but my sensibilities are staging a rebellion at just past the aforementioned half-way mark.<br /><br />Another page of text describing how the protagonist, Diana, does nothing other than passively accede to the commands of another character (be it her beloved, his mother, or someone else,) to eat, drink tea, exercise, bathe, sleep, or don yet another monotone outfit is hard to take.<br /><br />Did you ever play The Sims, in its early days, on PC? Without employing cheats, you'd spend SO MUCH time meeting your character's most basic needs on Maslow's hierarchy that the game just ran out of fun quickly. That's what's wrong with this story, in part. Discounting covering her physiological needs, this character does nothing. And she COULD do some really cool stuff, seeing as how she's purported to have an über-supply of witchly potential.<br /><br />When the other reviewers say that nothing happens in this story? They're not kidding. After a protracted set-up (which you naively tolerate, on the sad assumption that it's required before the action takes off,) the action never takes off. At all.<br /><br />edit: I finished the book. At 55% on the Kindle, readability improved from \\"trying\\" to \\"passably interesting.\\" This is because a) the two main characters fooled around, b) a new character FINALLY transcended the shady glances Diana's detractors had been shooting at her up until this point and beat her up, and c) Diana was permitted one usage of avada kedavra...oops, I mean she got to do one cool magical thing.<br /><br />This change of pace allowed me to proceed without imploding. Also added were a jangle of peripheral characters who interacted in awkwardly disjointed paragraphs, which had me thinking \\"what? huh?\\" and re-reading to make sure I hadn't overlooked thetransition.<br /><br />Then, bam, the book ended with the expected \\"tune in next week,\\" and I was done.<br /><br />If I loved this book I would want to own a hard copy. I don't though. Daughter and I would both consider reading the next installment on Kindle, were it not offered at the rip-offish price of $14.99...wait...it just went down $2. Maybe I'll hold out a while longer.<br /><br />As for this review, I don't think I'll change my rating. I'd give it another 1/2 star, but there isn't one, and 3 is too many. Overall, this was not a novel in which I could lose myself.  You can't when you read every page actively wondering \\"Where was her editor?\\"<br /><br />(My best takeaway from this experience is that daughter and I will occasionally spot a horrific navy blue turtle neck with half-length sleeves in a catalog and say \\"Diana would wear this.\\")
1936891026|5.0|Steven Pressfield does an excellent job of exposing the battle between paralysis and action in the act of creation and how all the stakes escalate the more deeply and passionately we feel about the art we are attempting to drag from our soul into the physical plane. An encouraging address of the personal resistance people face in the creative process and a guide to acting like a pro until you are one. It felt like an AA meeting. These were shameful things you just don't talk about. The exposure of our deepest fears of failure and success were inspiring in light of his nearly 4 decades of working on his craft before reaching success. He concludes that it is our love for the thing that calls to us that will see us through.

B003YL4LYI|3.0|I was hooked after the four book bundle and felt committed to the story.  Until a Dance with Dragons.  I was very disappointed.  Nothing happened with my favorite characters, and apparently, no one is safe from a horrible death.  With the possible exception of the villains of the piece.  They, somehow, manage to survive whatever justice is placed in their paths.  It is with dread that the reader will conclude there will be Others in Kings Landing very soon, since anyone who can possibly derail the apocalypse loses their lives.<br /><br />Brave Arya is just sliding into the role of sociopathic serial killer.  Why, when this is supposed to be an innocent child?  We are treated to the training of an assasin, child version.  Cercy walks down Central Ave and somehow loses her dignity and her claws?  And where is her justice for the deaths she has caused?  Nowhere.  Jon Snow performs the task of statesman, savior, generalisimo, all around good guy, and is horribly betrayed.  Meanwhile, everyone is still on their epic journey with no end in sight.<br /><br />Jaime and Brienne disappear with no indication of how she escaped the rope at the end of the last book.  Tyrienne is a joke, a 180 from the man he was as hand of the king.  And the dragons turn out to be dangerous monsters.<br /><br />I sat up for days trying to reach a place of some kind of rational pause, and it never came.  Somehow the world has gotten larger, more people and races are added, and it is all improbable.  Every rule of character and story development was flushed.  And worst of all, I can't seem to care if there is another book out to continue with slogging through the muck and mire of too many useless characters emerging at center stage, main characters dying (only the good guys mind you), and sea voyages of endless pukefests.<br /><br />It was a jumble, tangled, unfinished, wasteful of a reader's time.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I will not go into discussing in detail the obvious flaws in this story. Everyone who has read these books knows at this point that the story is unoriginal, badly edited, horribly written and ridiculously repetitive. I have little room to go into detail about this because I too found guilty pleasure in finishing this trilogy. Guilty pleasure does not equal a well written original best seller. How the books reached that status, I will never understand. What baffles me the most is how wives and girlfriends everywhere are insisting that they want their men to act more like Christian! They want abusive, sadistic, controlling men to dress seductively and beat the crap out of them in the bedroom(and sometimes in public). I can understand how they might confuse him with spontaneous and attentive but for the life of me I do not see how they would want a man who is so seriously broken. Maybe it is the money. I don't know. Bottom line: Twilight was better.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|It does not just stink, it's the worst piece of rubbish. Good I did not spend money to read the first few chapters, there are better books to buy and support talented writers.<br />This book is a piece of stinky sh1t -- lame characters, horrendous writing, NO editing, constant repetition of actions: biting lips, biting lips, biting lips, having sex, having sex, having sex, releasing the inner goddess, releasing the inner goddess; ahh, need I go on, or did you get it?<br />I love reading, I read anything I can get my hands on, but this garbage does not even deserve my time, I won't finish it.<br />To understand the level of this book just take a look at some 5-star reviews -- the worst grammar, the worst vocabulary, or one single sentence about how great the love story is behind ... umm, behind what? Behind the horrible writing? Behind the publisher's greed? Behind the human inanity and stupidity?<br />Shame on the publishers, who thought it their duty to infect the already half-dead minds with the worst kind of diarrhoea.<br />Read good books, run from this garbage.

B006LSZECO|4.0|This is the second Gillian Flynn book I've read. The first, \\"Sharp Edges\\" left me feeling icky. I started but couldn't finish \\"Dark Places.\\" Then FINALLY I got the notice that this book was waiting for me at the library. I liked it, but as stated it left me feeling unsatisfied. I just wanted something to happen at the end, for that girl to get what she deserved and for the guy to...well...I'm not sure what I wanted for the guy. What I didn't want was for them to breed. It was good. I will reccomend it, but I won't fawn over it like some of the other reviewers here.
B003B0D2QU|1.0|I think Mr Obama says it best by replacing business with book.<br /><br />I'm always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart. There are a lot of smart people out there. It must be because I worked harder than everybody else. Let me tell you something -- there are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there.<br /><br />If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you've got best selling bool -- you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen.

1594745692|5.0|This fully functional tarot deck manages to be something more than just a gimmick through two things:  Ms. Graham's smart writing for the instruction manual, and Mr. Kepple's faux-60's styled artwork.  Seriously, give a look at the extra images here.  Gorgeous design work, from the box to the cards.<br /><br />The interpretations (and instructions) are, as mentioned, fully functional... though keeping in character with a zombie apocalypse.  A tough job, which Ms. Graham pulls off beautifully.  There are only two small notes (neither important for those familiar with tarot):  Cards coming up reversed is not mentioned at all, and the suit \\"pentacles\\" is replaced by \\"hazards\\" (with, naturally, a biohazard symbol).  As mentioned, neither is a big deal to someone who has used a deck before, but might be noted for someone coming to tarot for the first time with this deck.<br /><br />This is a great gift for someone who is a zombie or tarot lover, and an AWESOME gift for someone who is both.

B000FC2L1E|5.0|Today I finished the Voyager by Diana Gabaldon, third book in the Outlander series. After I clicked my Kindle off button I sat there feeling as if I'd digested a huge multi course dinner. This is a very long book, over a thousand pages in print and 1751kb and I never tired of the story. That's saying a lot. As a speed reader, I've a bad habit of skimming but not with Ms. Gabaldon's books. The imagery and thrills, kept me riveted turning page after page. I didn't want to miss a word and at the end I wanted to let it digest. It's been a while since I'd read the first two books and I worried about picking back up the story line. A needless concern. In the Voyager, Ms. Gabaldon weaves a beautiful story that reminds the reader where Claire and Jamie have been in the past and leaves us satisfied at the end.<br />In the Voyager, Claire, and her grown daughter, discover Jamie did not die in the killing fields of Culloden. Torn between staying with her daughter or traveling through time and space she finds a way to return to Jamie. Her adventures in a divided Scotland and a daring voyage into the unknown for the love and passion weave a spell binding story not to be missed.<br />[...]

038572179X|4.0|Readers who've objected to this book -- and those who do tend to object rather strenuously -- have focused mostly on its ending, which they have found, at the very least, unsatisfying, and at worst a betrayal of their good faith in a sort of literary partnership with the author. You know, \\"You, kind sir, write the book, and we will be carried away by your brilliance, insight and gift of language -- but you'd better not go too far.\\"<br /><br />McEwan, in \\"Atonement,\\" went rather too far for readers who expect linearity and those who get especially attached to their characters. Without revealing what the author does at the end, let's just say that it involves a truly omniscient twist that some regarded as nothing less than cruelty.<br /><br />But guess what? Life can be cruel. And this author knows that, and for this reader's money, has crafted a stunning work of fiction that reveals much about our human predicament. For one thing, if McEwan is correct, it does turn out that perception really is more important, or at least AS important, as reality. A child's perception, in \\"Atonement,\\" wreaks havoc in several lives. In my own life, I can point to several people whose perceptions damaged me in the extreme. In a couple of those cases, the person in question realized the mistake and took pains to correct it, mitigating or reversing the damage they'd done. In a couple others, the person involved maintained -- against all evidence to the contrary -- their rightness, even though they were brutally wrong. I have lost at least one relationship and one job because of a single person's perceptions, and in both cases, those perceptions had nothing to do with reality.<br /><br />That's why I have defended and even championed this book over the years, recommending it many times to friends and colleagues. In addition to calling attention to the vagaries of perception, it just happens to be beautifully written. And yes, the characters are so wonderfully and completely drawn that when their \\"true\\" fates are revealed, we feel the loss as gut-wrenching, almost intolerable.<br /><br />But I suspect that was the author's intent.<br /><br />If you value true honesty in your fiction choices, and if you are a reader inclined to take things more philosophically than strictly emotionally, I think you will find great value in this book.n their \\"true\\" fates are revealed, we feel the loss as gut-wrenching, almost intolerable.<br /><br />But I suspect that was the author's intent.<br /><br />If you value true honesty in your fiction choices, and if you are a reader inclined to take things more philosophically than strictly emotionally, I think you will find great value in this book.

0618918248|4.0|This book is written along the same lines as Christopher Hitchens. Mr. Dawkins does dwell more on scientific aspects and he does a good job on refuting creationism.  But creationism seems so ludicrous if one has a minimal knowledge of geology and paleontology. There are some parts of the book where Mr.Dawkins does ramble (too many words and overuse of scientific jargon) and equates science with life itself - as if all can be explained or appreciated from a scientific viewpoint. When not meandering scientifically he does bring up interesting positions. The surprising quotation from Barry Goldwater (on page 39 of my book) is an excellent example.<br /><br />When Dawkins tries to explain morality via natural selection I feel he is on shaky ground - once again he falls into the error of searching for \\"all the answers\\" within a scientific paradigm. His proposition of a need for God with the childs belief in adults is interesting. Children have an innate disposition to believe both the rational and the irrational as a survival mechanism. This belief carries into adulthood and becomes replaced by God with all the nonsense surrounding religious dogma. His discussion of child abuse and religion is informative. Religion indoctrinates and stifles the growth of children. Children brought up religiously are immersed in a cult which is protected under the guise of religions freedom. His discussion of the Amish was a case in point (page 328- 331). People have a very difficult time letting go of their religious beliefs - they become rejected and ostracized by their religious community.<br /><br />A favourite quote from Voltaire (page 306): \\"Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities.\\"
B005K17RU0|2.0|the app works fine on HTC EVO LTE for current temp and 15 day outlook, but I have had a heck of time loading radar. I am responsible for 26 people ay work and when we have bad weather, I need to be able to see what is going on outside. the radar doesn't work in good weather much less bad. so after 1 month of trying to get this app to load, I'm deleting it. I'm disappointed I paid for it.
B00881VLCE|5.0|this game is exactly like putting an actual puzzle together,  minus the scattered pieces. if you are an avid puzzle doer I strongly recommend this app.
B00005K3O4|5.0|Comedy, science fiction, horror, low budget, bad acting...perfect! Can someone tell me why we don't include these movies in the Academy Awards?<br /><br />\\"What are you gonna do with those pies, boys?\\"
034580404X|1.0|I was so looking forward to reading these, but what a disappointment.  I have nothing against erotica, but this was boring, repetitive and poorly written, and what little story there was could have been told in the first book.  If this is today's idea of literature, I feel sad.
B007KDFWRG|5.0|As i could of guested most of the bad reviews for this album are from hard core Derick Trucks band Fans.to bad for them, that they don't get it.I saw both Derick Trucks Band,and Susan Tedeschi Band live band back in 2009.they were both good on there own but this is with out a doubt better, and live is the best way to hear them. the DTB could get more than a little boring sometimes with long jams that got a little to experimental for me.and Susan's band stuck a little to much to the album versions of the songs.the best part  of the show was when she came out and sang with his band.the band got titer and she opened up.that's what you get here.yes mikes a great singer but the DTB did not give him that much to do anyway.there using his songs and this is much more song grounded material.and those who think this is a jam band it's not this is structured soul music.and the sound quality is way better than those so called get live albums from the seventies.i  should know I'm 53 years old.this is the hottest band in the world right now. It's some of there fan's who need to catch up.they know what there doing. the more i listen to it the more i get why they did it that way.my favorite song on the record is the title track Everybody's Talking.the took something long forgotten and gave it new life,but that's true of all the covers on this record.just keep listening and every track will grow on you.they will teach you that this is how it should be played.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I tried to read this and couldn't finish it. What is all the hype? I think it just goes to show you don't have to be a great writer to become a rich writer. Was it the bondage that grew everyone's attention or what? If someone wants to read very well written erotica..than Selena Kitt is by far one of the best out there. I'm still stunned...
030745455X|5.0|Best set of books I've ever read. Girl who played with fire, and Girl who kicked the hornets nest were the best ever. Both super, last one the best. I thought the Grirl w/dragon tatoo started very slowly with family descriptions, then exploded into a super wild read. I'm sorry the author passed on, I want more.<br /><br />I've also been reading Joel Rosenberg, great also. First set of 5 was super, next, the 12th Eman and Terahan Initiative are even more capturing. The third one is supposed to come out in the fall, and I can't wait!<br /><br />Mr. Bob
B004SBQGHS|3.0|with the new update the game had to be uninstalled causing the loss of ALL previous saved game play. love the game but that pisses me off
B00884GR0W|5.0|I love this app. Its just like Minecraft. But way better. I cant quite get to Hell yet but when I do I'm making a house there and staying there.
1401229921|5.0|It's beautiful stuff, lee's pencils are extraordinary, in fact his truly shines in its penciled form. If you loved HUSH or even like it a little get this book! And if you at any point in your life love Jim Lee's work and need some artistic inspiration get this book! I would love to see more unwrapped book of other artists.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a really fun app. also it is a good app to the the kids I babysit interested for hours!!!
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|A great game as games go.  Just one word of warning: when you install the update, it installs fresh.  You'll lose all your history, including high scores and levels you've unlocked.  The warning you get is that it needs to uninstall as part of the reinstall; that's not explicit that it will destroy all your history data, but that is in fact what happens.  I figured it might, and went for it anyway.<br /><br />To me, the data loss was really no big deal: I let my kids loose with it, allowing them the satisfaction of of getting a lot of high scores; but I bet that this will tick a lot of people off.  It is enough to lose a star or two on this review.
1400069289|3.0|This is certainly a well researched book, but that's the problem. I bought the audio version and I'm still trying to get through it. The book is 400 pages - it's too much. The stories are endless -- and exhausting. The author would have provided a better service to both himself and the reader (listener) by sharing less.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I got the notice that i needed a app update today.<br />It got to 3% and ran my usage up to half of my monthly limit. The the update froze and stayed that way for 8 hours. Amazon sucks.<br />I have now removed all Amazon apps from my phone as they seem to not care about how they use data and time it takes. Jeff Bezos you used to stand behind and in front of your company. Not so much anymore.<br />I absolutely would run from Amazon and its app store and find more reliable places to get you apps from.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved fifty shades of grey and was sad when it was over and I found this that was good as well. Can't wait for the next book in Oct. Sad we have to wait found myself not being able to put this book down. Good read
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very fun app lots pf games to choose from.  earning points to unlock new games is a great time killer. my three year old loves it mist as must as I do.
0439023521|5.0|Brilliant.  I love it.  I was hooked from page one and every time I make the mistake of reading the first page again, I end up reading the whole thing again.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|I'll add this thought. Those of you criticizing the acting might want to keep in mind since these are Seals portraying Seals it could just be that's how Seals are and they're not \\"acting\\". Which is otherwise called realism.
0345803485|1.0|Unreadable.  For all the reasons other reviewers have outlined and more.  If you can borrow a copy, you might try wading through this drivel, but please, please don't spend any money on this \\"book\\".
B007VT6QSI|5.0|come on!!! are these personal comments neccessary?? he's 18, multi-millionaire, his albums go to #1 all around the world...he chased his dream. i can't get over how some of you can hate a complete stranger and all he's doing is being an artist and making music he likes!! lay off the hate!!<br /><br />ok, now to the album...his new single 'as long as you love me' is beyond good!! i've been addicted to it and i'm very proud to help him get those 10mill. views on his vid over on youtube.  picked up the album over @ bestbuy and the 3 songs i personally like are: as long as you love me (I think it's his best song!! he worked with michael jackson's producer on invincible rodney jerkins. no wonder everyone can't stop listening to it!! all around the world and one love. again, i did just buy the cd, so i'm still getting into it. but if you like pop music, give his album a try. i personally love the beatles, michael jackson, but i'm willing to give anyone a fair chance. and he seems like a decent young man to me and he co-wrote just about everything on the album. just shows how talented he really is. no wonder it went #1 everywhere!!<br /><br />if justin is out there reading this: i'm VERY impressed with all your success!! i can't get over how hot your new single is, so you have a huge fan in me!! best of luck in everything you do!! the music industry needs artists like you, who can explode everywhere and still set a good example to their fans. and your vid rocks!! i still can't believe that vid got 10mill+ views in just 3 days!! he wanted everyone to check it out and that's exactly what everyone did!
B00127RAJY|5.0|Let me start of by saying that I am not an athlete or a big fan of exercising- I will never be one. At 13 years old, I was almost 160. When I got to high school, the pounds started shredding off and I was at 130. After high school, I gained it all back and started this DVD when I weighed roughly 150. The first day that I started this workout, I definitely took my time with it. I think it's a great idea for everyone to watch the DVD through at least once just get an idea of what you'd be doing. I didn't push myself as hard the first day because I wanted to get my form correct and learn all of the moves. Day two- I was already sore! Every part of my body was hurting but I was so motivated to continue working out because I felt like I was starting to see results. Push yourself a little bit everyday and you'll definitely see yourself being able to do the whole workout without stopping. I am currently on day 5 and have lost a good 3 pounds along with watching my calorie intake. A really good trick that I had learned watching Dr Oz was to eat a banana before working out- this is a really great energy booster and the nutrients and vitamins aren't bad for you either! I will be beginning Level 2 of this workout DVD in another couple days when I started to feel confident that I am ready to move on. Even though it does say 30 days, it's best to go at your own pace. Some of the moves were difficult for me to do but since I've been working it little by little everyday, it's definitely starting to get easier. I love this workout DVD and wished that I had gotten it sooner. I'm so ready to get the flat stomach and toned muscles that I've been wanting since forever.<br /><br />Starting weight: 150<br />Days on workout: 5<br />Current weight: 147<br />Goal weight: 125<br /><br />UPDATE!<br /><br />I have now moved onto Level 2 after going 7 days on Level 1 of this workout. Level 2 is INSANELY challenging! The first day, I actually quit after 7 minutes. Today is actually my second dayand I've improved. I'm trying to not push myself too hard since I did do some damage to my knees at work- I quit after 21 minutes. Now that I think about it, I should've just finished it! (Lol) I did weigh myself today and I have lost a good 4 pounds! I'm extremely excited about the scale giving me all this positive feedback but what's even better is that I actually see a difference. Another thing I've been doing when I quit in the middle of Level 2's workout is going back to Level 1 and doing those exercises. I'm easing my way into Level 2's moves- so while I'm not quite completing it, I'm still shedding calories by exercising to Level 1 (I hope this makes sense).<br /><br />Days on workout: 9<br />Days on Level 2 Workout: 2<br />Current weight: 143<br />Current weight loss: 7 pounds<br />Weight loss goal: 18 pounds left!

B001ANYDAO|5.0|Outliers was a tremendous book that displayed many different \\"famously rich figures\\" and dug deep to find out the reasons to their success. Gladwell describes how our IQ does not define us as a person or our success in life and that their are many other circumstances that come into play. Being at the right place at the right time definitely has something to do with success but Gladwell also touches on how we put ourselves in those situations by who we surround ourselves with. We cannot control who our parents are (nor do I believe we would want that) and we do not control were and when we live. If your father is Albert Einstein I am sure you will be AMAZING at math but not just because of your IQ, but because of the nature factor of having your father as Albert Einstein. The book brings up a subtle notion of Nature vs Nurture.<br /><br />Amazing book and tremendous read, not all statistics but more of short stories and reasoning behind success.<br /><br />MUST GET!!!
B000L53D4O|5.0|This walker did wonders! I bought this for my 10 month old son because I noticed he was starting to attempt to walk and I thought this could help. It did! After just a few days of using this walker my son can walk all by himself! He's all over the house now. He doesn't really need this anymore, but he likes to push it around, or play with the toys on it. I would definitely recommend this. It's cheap, and gets the job done. Whether it be for entertainment, or helping your child to walk on their own.

B007LNJ4YW|4.0|Hard to believe but Beach House, the duo consisting of Victoria Legrand (yes, niece of THE Michel Legrand) and Alex Scally, have slowly but steadily growing their fan base ever since their humble debut album, now in the meantime already 6 years ago. 2010's \\"Teen Dream\\" was very well received, both critically and commercially, in the indie-music scene. Now comes the band's 4th album.<br /><br />\\"Bloom\\" (10 tracks + 1 hidden track; 60 min.) starts off with an entrancing \\"Myth\\", and that song sets the tone (and tempo) for the entire album pretty much. When listning to the next track \\"Wild\\", which is probably the most readily accessible tarck on here, I couldn't help but think how majestic and large that song sounds, and frankly most of the album. It feels like singer-lyricist finally has the necessary confidence to show ambitions that were not readily apparent before this album. It's hard to pinpoint highlights as such, as the album truly plays as a unit, rather than a hap-hazard collection of songs. Please note that the supposedly 16 min. closing track \\"Irene\\" is really a 5 min. song, followed by 8 min. of silence and then giving way to a 3 min. hidden track, which is a pretty weak song actually, so for me the album really concludes at the end of \\"Irene\\".<br /><br />In all, the slow but steady rise of Beach House continues with this album. \\"Bloom\\" sounds more polished, more ambitious, and grander than any of the previous albums. I had the good fortune of cathing Beach House in concert at the 2010 Coachella festival, touring in support of \\"Teen Dream\\", and that set was one of THE highlights of the festival for me. I can only imagine that they sound even better now. Meanwhile,\\"Bloom\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
1846554071|4.0|Aomame stepped out of a taxi onto an expressway and walked down a service stair into the world of 1Q84. And she began her journey in search of the boy she had met as a child.<br /><br />As in other novels, Murakami proved himself a master storyteller, taking the readers through twists and turns into a dreamlike world. A world with two moons. A cult that turned violent. A leader who abuses young girls, including his daughter. A novel about chrysalises and \\"Little People.\\" A teenage girl with a mysterious past. The mood and feel are similar to those of The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle and Kafka on the Shore.<br /><br />However, the dialogues undermined the storytelling. When one character echoes the others, we could attribute it to the quirks of that individual, in other words, characterization. But when every character echoes others, then the dialogue annoys and detracts from the story.<br /><br />Murakami tells the reader that Tengo is a math genius but he didn't convince me. A math genius is unlikely to teach cram school. But the main issue is that Murakami didn't show that his protagonist is a math genius. If Tengo solves a somewhat difficult mathematical problem, for example, then I would be more convinced.<br /><br />Leonard Seet<br />[...]

B0051BNRTO|4.0|I love Nick Hornby. His novels aren't serious and deep, and he obviously isn't trying to win a brand-name literary prize or reach the pinnacle of the literary pecking order. He's just very good at the basic job of a novelist: creating characters who are real that his readers will care about and involving them in a realistic plot that reaches a satisfactory conclusion. Here his main character is Annie, a 39-year-old woman living in a nowhere seaside town in the north of England who wonders how she ended up spending the last 15 years of her life with Duncan. Duncan is a dweeb who teaches at the local college and obsessively chronicles on a website the life and lyrics of Tucker Crowe, an American rocker who bailed on his career at the height of his success promoting a album entitled Juliet 22 years earlier. The story opens with Annie and Duncan on a Crowe pilgrimage in America: to the home where he was born in Bozeman, MT; to the house in Berkeley where Crowe's Juliet lived; to the Minneapolis bar bathroom where he decided to call it quits on music. They return to England to find that a promoter has mailed them the demo of a new Crowe album called Juliet Naked, and after their different takes on the album -- Annie's reasoned thumbs down and Duncan's delirious thumbs up -- go live on the Crowe website, havoc ensues. Duncan falls into a relationship with a new colleague and Annie falls into an email flirtation with Crowe. If a woman had written this book, it would be marketed as a contemporary romance, and that's what it is. Hornby leaves out the cute stuff that's required in a rom-com, and the finally-getting-together scene happens off the page, but he delivers the obligatory happily-ever-after.

B005KDWUFA|5.0|Purchased this CD after purchasing Special Edition of CD,DVD and Book. I bought it as a back up ANNNND I wanted the CD Photo! LOL. On the special Edition, CD was fine but I was disappointed in the quality of the so-called (cardboard) protective covers for CD and DVD. If you do not place them into their protective sleeves with the album title against the folded-in edges, they can easily be scratched and damaged.  DVD was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!  Not the song selection, and their voices were wonderfull as usual, but the filming and editing were not good.  On closeups, the boy's heads (just above the hairline) was consistantly cut off.  Too many shots of the audience and orchestra, too much camera jumping around on the film clips. Also, the book was not that great.  Some beautiful photos but I guess Carlos just wanted himself to be known as a \\"Ladies Man\\", how boring!  Out of 21 photos,there are 9 photos where he is surrounded by 6 women,4 women, 3 women, and 2 of 1 women.  The flirtyness on stage is ok, but after a while it just seems sleazy, certainly not classy. I think he needs a new writer who can write something funny, sexy, but ELEGANT.  Some of it just seems inappropriate, (Not in this performance) as when they are singing \\"Everytime I Look At You\\" when Carlos sings the verse \\"and with you lying next to me, feels like I can hardly breathe\\" his actions seem to take away something of David's tenderness on the following verse \\"I close my eyes the moment I surrender to you.\\"  So,as I wrote, somewhat disappointing for a special edition that was pre-ordered and cost over $100.00. So, even though I stand behind the above opinion, I still love Il Divo and am looking forward to the next album release!!!!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have tried other apps that have similar sounds but this is the first where you can custom combine them which I love.  Also love how they display the sound options, visually nice but also easier to find than my other sound app. Wish some of the sounds were not so repetitive, like the cat purring is so short, as it repeats, it doesn't sound real.  Still think it's a great app.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|the game is fun for my son. it is easy to understand and fun to play. he really enjoys it!

0060245867|5.0|This was the first in a series of laugh-out-loud books beginning with \\"If you give...\\"  If you give a mouse a cookie, or a moose a muffin, or a pig a pancake and so on. My children loved them all, but this one is one is my favorite. It makes a great gift, too.
B001OD6HO0|4.0|Love this first album of hers, ended up finally caving in and buying it on vinyl so I could listen it on my turntable. Only complaint would be that it's the clean version...they insert scratching sounds to cover up provocative words.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|All the components and controllers work as advertised, both the usb 3.0 and the eSata ports are good. It came with BIOS revision F6, and at mobo revision 1.1, that's enough to make it work with any newer BD Processor. Very happy with the purchase.
