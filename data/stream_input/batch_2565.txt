B00AZRBLHO|1.0|I'm sorry. This was recommended by several fellow security folks as required reading but I can't stand things written in the present tense. They just make no sense to me. I can't read it. I know, this sounds flaky and arbitrary on my part, and it is, but the present fad for present tense is not to my liking. Had I known it was written this way I would not have bought it.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|First of all I have to say I'm a huge fan of James's blog, but this has been the first book of his that I've read. He cuts through all the bull and gets right down to the nitty gritty. I really wish I would've had this book when I turned 18. This is basically a guide on how to live your life filled with lots of useful information. The big wake up call for me is that he said that the future is everyone being either temp staff or entrepreneurs. I for one plan to choose myself.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I don't get it!! I'm sure this wasn't the original ending Sylvia had in mind, somehow along all the book release date pushback, someone got greedy from the success and gave us an awful 3rd book just so they can make money from 2 more. I loved the first 2 books so much and I have read many Sylvia Day books, I'm a huge fan! Can't say how much I am disappointed with this one that I had been so anxiously waiting more than any book ever! It's as if someone else took over the story, stretched it to thin, on things that didn't matter to the reader like so much of Megumi and other conversations with ppl that had me yawning so much of the time. I hated Eva in this book, it ruined everything for me, she's so not deserving of Gideon, and why was she thinking of Brett in that way, she's supposed to love Gideon but then she agreeing to see Brett like if Gideon doesn't matter to her,  then her not wanting to marry him was sad, for dumb reasons I must add, oh and the wedding so uneventful I was falling asleep, this was supposed to be \\"Happily ever after\\" 3rd book or so I thought. I have to Say tho Gideon Cross ruined me, their is no other book boyfriend like him ever!<br /><br />The way the book ended does not entice me to read a 4th book, I'll wait for review's of the 4th book if she makes up for this disappointing 3rd book, I just might read, I still love you Sylvia Day, still my favorite author! I'd like to think it was some sort of pressure from the publisher to stretch it out this way I know your original ending would of been a big hit!!!
B009NY43NY|3.0|I started this series years ago. And every year I couldn't wait till the new book came out. I loved the idea that so much excitement was happening to such an unlikely heroine. This book fell flat for me. I was satisfied with the outcome of Sookie's life but felt nothing. That was so disappointing to me. I felt so much love for each of the characters as they evolved in this series, but honestly I don't have any memorable moments when I think about this book. The subtlety was gone. It was worth the read to end the story, but I would have never read beyond the first book if it fell as flat as the last.

B008J2GAKU|5.0|Scott Snyder has crafted a master piece that surpasses the works of Jeph Loeb, Frank Miller, and Grant Morrison. In this thrilling mystery Snyder actually creates new batman villains that are actually as interesting(if not even more interesting) as the classic villains. This one book gives us insight into Batman's first mystery and has a good cast of characters both old and new. This book also leads directly into the major Batman crossover Night of the Owls. This book comes highly recommended to all comic fans and if you don't like this I suggest you seek therapy imeadietly.

0345535421|5.0|If you haven't read [[ASIN:0553386794 A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1)]] then you need to stop, get that book and read it first.  So much of this book is set up in the first book, you are doing yourself a disservice by not reading it first.  That and this review will spoil that book if you keep reading it, but it will be as spoiler-free as possible for A Clash of Kings.<br /><br />At the beginning of this book there are 5 kings in Westeros.  Joffrey Baratheon, Stannis Baratheon, Renly Baratheon, Robb Stark, and Balon Greyjoy, (he's not a king at the very beginning, but he will be shortly.)  Jon Snow is on the wall, Sansa is still betrothed to Joffrey, Robb Stark is fighting in the forest, Jaimie Lannister is still in captivity, Danaerys is still wandering the free cities, and Tyrion Lannister is still making his way to King's landing.<br /><br />This second book mostly has to do with the war between the 5 kings.  It is heavy on battles, strategy, and also character development.  The moves made by all of the parties involved are central to the story, but George R.R. Martin does such a good job of weaving the tapestry, that you are not confused by what is going on at all.  It's really a very readable story even though its nearly a thousand pages long.<br /><br />What Martin does better than anything else in this book is establish characters.  He lets us peer deep into their thought process in order understand what motivates them and even to maybe root for certain characters that we may not have otherwise rooted for otherwise.<br /><br />Another masterful entry into the \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" series.
B00005K3LU|5.0|The first of a series is always the best.  Willis is funny and always pulls off his deeds of destruction.
0553386794|5.0|I got this book after watching season 1 on DVD.  I loved the show and decided that I would read the books before watching any more seasons.<br /><br />The TV show follows the book extremely faithfully.<br /><br />Whether you have seen the TV show or not, you will love this book.  The chess game that is the Game of Thrones is so engrossing you will literally spend hours that you didn't plan on getting lost in the world of Westeros.<br /><br />The story begins in Winterfell, home of the Starks.  The king, Robert Baratheon, is coming to visit Lord Eddard Stark to ask him to be his \\"hand\\" who will handle most of the ruling of the seven kingdoms while the king does whatever he wants.  In the case of King Robert, it's whoring, drinking, hunting, and some more drinking.<br /><br />While the king is in Winterfell, someone pushes Bran, one Ned Stark's son's out of a window.  Then the intrigue begins.  I can't get too much more into the plot without giving it away but there is mystery, murder, love, lust, intrigue, battle, honor, and treachery.  Just what every good book needs!<br /><br />Martin has created a world where not everything is as it seems.  Nobody is safe (and I mean NOBODY) and not everybody is what they seem.  Have we seen the real enemy, or is there something else at work?  You constantly have to be on your toes because you really don't know what to expect.  Even when you know some of the events are coming, you figure that the protagonists will figure a way out of them, or will they?<br /><br />The book is in the fantasy genre, but fans of any genre can read and enjoy this book.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Great story. Denzel was great as usual. His portrayal of his character was awesome. So much of the real life comes through, if you've ever lived with an alcoholic. Becomes the real hero in the end.
034554398X|5.0|I have to admit, the first half of this book was hard to get through.  Until about page 500 or so, it seemed that the book was going to be about the about the main characters just wandering from place to place.  They all seemed to lack direction and I thought this train was going off the rails.<br /><br />At around page 600 everything changed.<br /><br />I mean everything.  To even touch on the events would really give away the best part of the book and the series so far.  i will just say that everything changes.  The stakes change, the players change, and the game changes.  Martin took a world that we already were getting to know and turns it on its ear.  I can't really say much more about the book itself other than READ IT!<br /><br />The top-notch character development in the book really what sets this series apart.  You really feel closer to characters such as Robb, Catelyn, Arya, and Sansa Stark.  You become impressed with Danaerys Targaryan (if you weren't already) and you start to maybe have some different feelings toward characters such as Sandor Clegane and Jaimie Lannister.  While Tyrion Lannister remains everyone's favorite imp.<br /><br />The second half of the novel is one you may wind up reading in one sitting.  Martin more than makes up for the seeming lack of direction in the first half of the book that it seems like the hits will just keep on coming forever.  Looking back on the entire book, the first half was necessary to set up the events in the second half and really couldn't have been written any other way.  This is what makes Martin a true master of his craft.  Instead of being light on set up and getting straight into the action, he spends about the same amount of time that other writers would spend on their entire book just setting up what is to come.<br /><br />In the mean time, you feel like you are taking part in this epic tale.  You are right there living all of these events that Martin goes over in detail.  Not to mention all of the history of Westeros that he covers throughout all of the books.  This world could potentially be the size of the Star Wars universe with all of the groundwork that Martin has laid.ory of Westeros that he covers throughout all of the books.

B005LAIHRC|5.0|This movie is fun.  You just have to watch it expecting that!  Its a romantic comedy, it's light, the music is GREAT, especially if you are of a certain generation!  I have seen it 4 or 5 times in the course of that many months and I will watch it again soon.  Would recommend to anyone who just wants to have fun watching a movie!

1781162646|5.0|I had been waiting for this book for several months now and had high expectations as I always do for any Stephen King novel. Although this isn't a long novel like King's other works, he creates an amazing story and setting with less than 300 pages. This was one of the coolest and fun stories I have read by King because of its simplicity. It's one of those books that you don't have to put weeks into it before you get to the good part. I got this book the day it was released and finished it the next day. It starts off interesting and doesn't get stale throughout the whole novel. Even the parts where Devin (the protagonist) is going through all the details of what one must do when they work for Joyland. All of it was interesting to read. If you think that because of its lack of pages there will be no deep character development boy are you wrong! I foolishly thought this would happen and luckily I was wrong for underestimating King's ability to make you care for the characters since this is what he does best. Although Devin's friends that he lives with during the summer are not very developed, Devin, Annie and her son will grow on you and you will begin to feel the pains that they feel.<br /><br />I pictured this book being a fast, fun and cheesy read and instead I came across a fantastic story that left me feeling incredibly sad and happy after I finished reading it. Although the story centers around the mystery of a serial killer who has murdered a woman in the amusement park known as Joyland (Devin's workplace), you quickly realize that that is only a side story in something much larger; the painful process of growing up and the ability of coping with death. I would encourage anyone who likes King's other works to purchase this book. It is very cheap here on Amazon and it will give you hours of entertainment. In a way I suppose I liked this book because we can all relate to Dev in many ways. We all know the difficulties of accepting hardships that are inevitable and, in-case you forgot, I can assure you that Devin's extraordinary adventure in Joyland will freshen up your memory. Thanks Mr.King for another fantastic adventure!in-case you forgot, I can assure you that Devin's extraordinary adventure in Joyland will freshen up your memory.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I am in love with this book because one, I can tell if a book has too little detail and this had just enough two, I really enjoyed how riordan made sure Percy or annabeth didn't get to much attention I recommend this book to people who like mysteries but also mythology.
B008JFUP0I|5.0|It was truly an all around perfect movie. I loved it and this is coming from someone who had only seen bits of pieces of the other 5 movies. Can't wait for 7, hopefully The Rock comes back or I'll be disappointed.

B006C1DH92|5.0|I didn't really think there was much you could improve with the addictive Fruit Ninja Game but this adds a second mode that includes a progressively more difficult series of varied challanges that add a great deal of interest and variety. And yes, the narration / quips included to sound authentic enough to be very pleasant.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I considered Hosseini's first book, The Kite Runner, one of the best three or four I'd ever read, but this one was, for me, a real let-down. The multigenerational span of the plot is way too huge for easy reading, especially when most of the characters have names difficult to remember for a native English speaker. The author's style was difficult to follow: fairly frequent shifts, for no apparent reason, from past to past perfect tense and back again, frequent shifts of point of view for no apparent reason and with no transition to ease the way. In a nutshell, the book follows an interesting tale, but it would benefit from a good dose of expert editing.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|One of the things I like most about this app is what I tend to think of as a hidden feature: The build in music player and songlist creator which I have taken to using more often than the default Kindle music player because it is easier and less buggy to build playlists in.
159463176X|5.0|Khaled Hosseini is one of the most brilliant writers I have read who takes you on a reading journey you will never forget. From THE KITE RUNNER to the gorgeous and powerful A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS to his most current book which I just finished yesterday, AND THE MOUNTAINS ECHOED, his descriptive writing and his ability to develop characters which stay in your mind forever, makes his books a MUST READ. In THE MOUNTAINS ECHOED, this book brings you into the Afghanistan of today while starting at an earlier time of Afghan history in which you have wealthy families in Kabul living in splendid homes with great wealth and then as the book progresses to the war times in Afghanistan with the characters journey alongside the country's history and you experience their pain. The anguish of a brother losing his sister and the love he has for her hit me in my own relationship with my own sister and the joy you feel when you overcome that distance. Mr. Hosseini has written, AGAIN, a powerful book and takes you to Afghanistan to view a picture of characters which are so different from the destruction of war and Taliban killings you read in the newspapers. I can hardly wait for his next book.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|I can use it for everything from timing how long I spend doing certian activities such as exersizes or finishing a task to use for time-outs with different timers allowing for different times for different ages of child available at a single touch, to blocking out 2, 5 or 15 minute segments of time to work on a given chore as is recommended in some productivity methods. It includes several handy preset timers which can be editted, In fact every timer you create can be given a customizable name, catagory, icon, &#34;ringtone&#34; or alarm, settings as to screen flashes if in silent mode and so on. If I had to make any complaint it is that if you allow it to flash the screen, it can make it take a second to get back to end the timer but I just don't use that feature in my case and can see how it would be vital for some other folks.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book can kind of drag on and on and on. It is definitely not the most interesting book in this series.
0671449028|5.0|my grandchildren enjoy the book and have named all the characters used to to descibed their bed time routine.  It is sturdy and seems to be holding up to a 2 and 3 year old.
B008IGANGO|4.0|It was a pleasant diversion to go back and watch the premise from which the ever-popular, long running TV series was spawned.  Being a DEVOTED, M*A*S*H enthusiast, I was interested to see how many of the characters and episodes of the subsequent TV shows were &#34;sketched out&#34; within the context of the origiinal movie.  Although I never saw it when it was released back in the early 70's, I thoroughly - and perhaps more so - enjoyed watching it now....having seen every TV episode no less than 8-10 times!

I took a mythology class in college, but I think I learned more about Greek mythology through this series than in that class.  It inspired me to look up some of the things that weren't described in detail and learn even more.  This is a great book for kids and adults alike and includes a lot of great historical information.

I am indeed no physicist, carry no Academic degrees anyway but think apparently exactly like them! If you get this book (I Highly suggest Everyone does!) read Every single part, meaning it has not only a Forward, Epilogue and Afterward but there is a really cool interview in the very back.  Making Krauss' book superb is the Index!  How complete!  I will cherish, wish he'd make a hardback!

B0070UFMOW|4.0|I purchased this Fiio to drive my Audio Technica ATH-M50 headphones off an iPod classic. I have a pretty good ear for sound quality, and have been into audio equipment for over twenty years. I used this with a line out from my iPod classic bypassing the internal amp to the Fiio E17. Actually I couldn't tell a difference between the Fiio amp and plugging them straight into the iPod's amp. Apparently the built in iPod amp isn't as \\"horrible\\" as people always seem to claim. Granted the Audio Technica's that I am using are only 32ohms, and I suspect that is probably the max you would want to drive with just the straight iPod. So if you have higher impedance headphones, you would probably need the Fiio or some other amp. The amp was very clear and no distortion I could detect from my listening, and the bass and treble controls are a nice feature as well. I didn't have a need to test the DAC portion of the Fiio, so I can't comment on that portion of the product. If I had a need for a DAC, I might have kept the Fiio. As it stands I returned it because for $130.00 it didn't improve sound enough over the iPod to warrant the money. It didn't down grade sound either though. And I'm sure it would probably play louder before distorting, but for how loud I listen the iPod does surprisingly well. So bottom line if you just want a headphone amp for your iPod classic and your headphone are in the 30ohm or lower range, you may not see much if any difference in sound quality. IF you have a smaller iPod nano or especially shuffle, I don't know if they have as powerful an amp as the classic or not.

B00BEXB18M|4.0|I'm not going to waste your time with some essay about how long I've been a fan etc -there are enough of those in other reviews- I bought the album so clearly I'ma fan of the band haha.<br /><br />Anyway, this album is definitely more rooted in a hard rock vibe than traditional thrash metal. Songs are more radio friendly than usual, but its clearly a megadeth album.<br /><br />The Good<br />+ There is some thrash here<br />+ Standard megadeth political topics come up<br />+ The bonus songs on the limited edition are a must, ESPECIALLY the live performance of Countdown to Extinction<br />+ Not full blown melt your face thrash, but fun to listen to. Great driving music ya know? It pumps you up yet its relaxing<br />+ Some of the experimental tracks are really good, and a nice treat I think to even the most purist of fans. An example would be the Blackest Crow. Lyrically, its OK but the sound mix is great and something I wouldn't mind seeing more of.<br /><br />The Bad<br />- Mustaine's writing is not what it used to be it seems. A majority of the songs on this album have simple rhymes that seem... elementary. It's like he went out of his way to make them super simple when where Mustaine usually shines is his ability to write with a broad lexicon or complex words rather than simple, more pop like setups.<br />- This feels more like a side project for Megadeth than a full blown album.<br />- This album doesn't seem to have a unifying theme to it, but maybe I'm just missing it.<br /><br />The Neutral<br /><br />-/+ Dance in the Rain features guest vocals by David Draimen of Disturbed/Device. I was not looking forward to this track but to be 100% honest, you can BARELY tell he sings in it, at all, and its briefly at the end. It works. The track is serviceable. The song content is great.<br /><br />-/+ I didn't like the title track at first, but then I started thinking about it differently and I find that its a good cruising song or something to listen to when I'm workingin the shop. Give it a chance and I think you'll like it when you accept that its a rock song and not a metal song.<br /><br />-/+ The artwork is pretty cool, but I don't find that it fits with the albums tone. Kind of a bummer for me.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br /><br />Its a solid album. If you are a fan, get it. If you want to pine for the good old days 30 years ago move along- this one is not for you. Mustaine can't sing like he used to, and at this point in his career creativity is a good thing. If you're hoping for the next Rust in Peace, you need to get over yourself. That era has passed. Like it for what it is instead of hating it for what it is not.<br /><br />The Neutral

B0090KZDSK|2.0|I was disappointed that it feels like the story is being stretched way too thin. I skipped many of the sex scenes (which is most of the book) because I was looking for the story but never really found it. I have really liked this series until this book but feel it hasn't really gone anywhere. I have read online that there will be two more books in this series which I find frustrating because I originally thought it was a trilogy. Not sure if I will continue with the next book.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|Great product. Excellent presentation, the movies i a good one.<br />The quality is excellent and the 3d is really good.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved the characters in this book.  I work with cancer patients and I thought the author did an excellent job conveying a more accurate depiction of how at least some patients may feel.
B008NEMN0K|5.0|Very good product.<br />The image quality is really good and the presentation is ok.<br />The 3d effects are really good
B000FCKC4C|5.0|The author combines his use of fable with an underlying spiritual theme. It's about living your dream and finding yourself. Would definitely recommend.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game I will play for hrs on end. The times I am doing nothing I am playing this game.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was definitely a page turner! I didn't see the plot twist coming and it sucked me in even more!
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|The twists and turns in this were completely unpredictable and created a great level of suspense! The story was great and the acting phenomenal.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I had heard of this series for months before I read them. I wish I had read them sooner. Very engaging and easy to read.  i couldn't wait to go to book 2!
B00899F0G8|5.0|I would be lying if I didn't say I love this series.<br />I watched one episode and was addicted<br />This psychological thriller will keep you coming back for more!!
B0089LOKHG|5.0|I hated that I finished the series. It was a wonderful dystopian series worth reading. I only didn't like the rapid resolution in this book. It seemed rushed.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|Puzzle are not obtuse and fit well within the story. Challenging, but not so you have to stop and Google the solution every other one.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|I really enjoyed this series! It ended too quickly but is an awesome dystopian series. If you enjoyed Hunger Games, you will love this.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This game is so much fun. I play it everyday and it is great. although sometimes it is a bit slow playing on line games, but I think that is a personal problem. it is a very fun game And what is even better is that it is free! Buy it now before it becomes a paid app. 5 stars! Keep it up gameloft!
B009O2XY12|4.0|Please send out an update for the kindle.  I've been waiting for a while.  it hasn't. been updated since Nov 2012.
B0011NVC98|3.0|I can forgive the liberties taken with a fundamental piece of history.  I can forgive a stretched and naked Ray Winstone.  I can even live with Beowulf s****ng Grendel's Mother, instead of fighting to the death.<br /><br />But, I can't be the only one who's spotted what has to be an \\"in-joke\\" by the scriptwriters, can I?<br /><br />Beowulf fights and kills Grendel.  He tracks down Grendel's Mother to her lair, and instead of killing her, she seduces him and allows him to escape with a piece of treasure.  Grendel's Mother ought to be no less hideous than Grendel himself, and equally brutal and venomous.  Here, rather, she's a naked Angelina Jolie.<br /><br />So, what is the item with which Beowulf escapes?  A golden, carved traditional Norse drinking vessel.<br /><br />If we take this at face value, it seems that Angeline Jolie gives Ray Winstone the perfect  horn...
B009NY43NY|3.0|Lets just say...I stumbled on to this series and didn't invest any $$$ on the books...free thru the library....except this one...shame on me!  Overall just disappointed...and not what I expected for the ending of the series!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Love these puzzles with a story line. The only complaint was it seemed too easy to defeat him at the very end. Pretty menacing and then....whoops! It's over.
1909313033|5.0|I loved this little book that captures all the loveable qualities of the pug. A must have for all lovers of this awesome little dog.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i just love the mines ziplines and ginet seliton monkey ohh the forest mines are so cool ur in a minecart lean collect cones
B00AK57N00|5.0|I figured id give this game a try and I am happy I did. It is a great game when burning time at work or stuck on the train. Pick it up you wont be disappointed.
B005HV6YO8|5.0|This album sums it up.  25 years of Sting. A nice long CD to enjoy loud or just play in the background
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This was an excellent ending to a wonderful series and I have enjoyed reading it, especially the ending more than once.
0807014273|5.0|I feel everyone should read this book to get a perspective on their own life.  His own story is an example of how one can find meaning in their own life.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It is not very good because it does not allow some other apps to download but I have bin lookin for a facebook app and it works to.
006114665X|3.0|For anyone interested in the deep background history of middle Europe before WW I  this is for you... Having read the Guns of August, which is much more readable, I wondered about some paragraphs that seemed nearly identical,particularly in the early chapters.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|Piano Guys always gets me a good mood.  Keeps my eye on the blessings I have in my life and gets my boys dancing on the active songs.
B008OOYALE|5.0|love this game. wish we could get the other versions of this game. dragon story fairy tales and more. dragon story Easter.
B006YTTVHO|1.0|Don't like it. To basic. I guess I was just expecting more. Might try another book by him. Glad it was free
B000KKJXGM|5.0|The book arrived in the condition I expected. It has the printed size type  which my wife needs for reading. which is why I ordered this copy.
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|I guess I did not read well enough before ordering. I am not on facebook and never intend to be, and it seems like you need to be for this game.
B000HF0ILY|4.0|Not as good as &#34;Outlaw Josey Wales&#34; but what is? Very well done beginning to end and one of Eastwood's best.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|It was okay read.  I would have liked to see at least somewhat of a progression.  I really didn't see much difference between second and this book.  I did like to read about the characters and some of the interaction between Eva and her friends.  But other than that I think the next book could do with less constant sex and more relationship between Eva and Gideon. I guess the most of what I got out of the book is that Gideon is ready to move on and have a more committed relationship, Eva is still trying to play both sides of the fence. Not real mature one of the two.  Don't know if I will continue with the next in the series..getting quite pricy....just have to wait and see how long the next book is before it is available.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|Stille on of the best sci-fi movies ever made and will always be timeless. Much better without narration although one can turn it on.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This is a series that keeps you wanting more...What will happen next I wonder? Waiting will surely be painful. Intrigued much.
B00AK57N00|5.0|This game is really easy to get going, but slowly gets more difficult, with the platforms changing sizes, and the wind and gravity.  It's a fun game, and would be great for little kids, or teenagers with too much free time.  It's fun, and addicting.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|The only issue I have with this game is losing track of the time. I love the graphics and soundtrack and the game is just super fun. it has unlimited replay value.
B00B99KJR0|3.0|The core game mechanic is the familiar falling-gem match-3, but this version pastes on some claptrap about collecting pieces of Victorian-era luggage.  I'd rather play Candy Crush.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I do not understand why Amazon does not enable sharing of highlights to FB or Twitter using the android app as from the standard Kindle. Moreover, on finishing a book one does not even get an opportunity to rate it. It is as though Amazon actively discourages communication among users. There is also no way to drag a highlight from one page to another. Because of these serious drawbacks, I give the app a generous two stars.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This application is a great time saver.  The battery can be checked at a glance.  Well worth having on the Kindle Fire.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Very entertaining. Finished in record time. First person shooter has a new meaning. I'll get my wife to read it next.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app gives you a few different styles for the alarm clock, it let's choose a different ring tone, and you may even personalize your ringtone with a song already downloaded onto your device.  I have found this app helpful for waking up on time for school, and for other activities.  Great app, does exactly what I want it to.
B00992CF6W|3.0|needs updates bad. if it had updates it would be a lot better I have over 2 stacks of iorn.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app gives me everything I need to track my local weather. The graphics help illustrate the actual weather conditions.
B00571F26Y|5.0|While this book makes sense to me, I wish I could stick to a wheat-free diet. Should be required reading for all Americans. Look around you. I mean, I watch Judge Judy every day and am convinced that most ALL Americans are suffering from wheat addiction simply by looking at their bloated abdomens and awful skin. STOP EATING PROCESSED FOODS, please.
B00BLGXL3U|5.0|I like this director and had wanted to see this movie for a while, but was put off by some bad reviews. When I got around to seeing it though, I found that the movie was excellent.<br /><br />Visually beautiful to watch, excellent acting and an compelling story that isn't dished out in child portions.
0446310786|5.0|I need the book for a school assignment and so much more out of reading it. It's a wonderful book regardless of the purpose of the reader.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Wasn't so sure at first on this one but it's awesome... It is a bit gruesome but the cinematography, acting and story lines are all captivating if you aren't bothered by the subject matter. Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys Criminal Minds or the like.
1863514260|5.0|Great book-good color photos-good detailed advice on color choices, and techniques for her projects-Anyone interested in needle painting should check this out
0770435726|5.0|Interesting twist on deceit and alter egos. Great descriptions of European travel. Great audio version! Could be a perfect summer indulgence!
B005P4P966|5.0|I love this show so much, that I can't stop watching it. Seriously, I have really never even heard of this show and all of a sudden I have watched ALL the seasons in a two month period.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Very fast paced and entertaining. True to spirit of original stories, altho details are obviously modern. Good acting. I really enjoyed this program.
0345529057|4.0|A more in depth read than I would have liked but I still like it and I would recommend it
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Such an entertaining television show... Unique to what is currently available. I'm definitely hooked and will be back for more when Season 2 comes out.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|This movie was a lot funnier than the trailers led me to believe.  Elizabeth Banks is hilarious, and a truthful portrayal of pregnancy
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Not as good as the others I have played, not very interesting as far as STORY lines go.  But the graphics are great. Won't stop me from buying more G5 games
1426209584|5.0|If you are a Bird Watcher,this extraordinary Book is going to spark in you the wish to travel and watch these beautiful Birds.<br />The book has fantastic photography and is well writen, you must have it
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|The hunger games is the dead horse that has been beaten. I was really excited to read it. But it's just kinda meh now. I already know the story because this is one of the trilogies people didn't care about spoiler alerts.
B00ACFL69C|5.0|I never liked Matthew McConaughey for the very fact he was the go-to guy when it came to being a heart throb in romantic comedies. All the girls seem to fawn over him but I never thought he was such a good actor. I can't watch 'Failure to Launch' because he is in it, despite Zoey Deschaunel's hilarious presence. However, in this disturbing but (in my perspective, also hilarious) movie, Matthew shows a crazier side to him. Sure, anyone who's bothered to watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation can see that he could deliver an odd personality when given the chance but rather than the hilariously wild man he's demonstrated before, this movie gives him a chance to show that on-the-edge kind of guy where anything can make him tick, and he's completely unpredictable. The chicken leg scene is a delight (watch the movie and that scene will make you rethink taking a chicken leg ever again). With the help of the actor who portrays (sorry, I don't know this actor's name) Ansel, this movie comes out to be comical. Without the aforementioned, I would be a little unhinged. I think this movie is one of those films that either you love it, or just plain hate. Personally, I love it.<br />I bought this movie on Amazon Instant Video and for the price being paid, I enjoyed it. I even watch it again (sometimes twice in a row). :)
B005LAIII0|5.0|This movie has to be seen Blue ray... no other way.<br />One of the most inspiring stories I have seen.
B0035XVVDY|5.0|I don't want to give anything away with this movie. So, I'll just say this: great acting and directing all around! Watch this one today!
1419705849|3.0|Its good as a long chapter book. I would not call it a middle school book. It has very good cartoons and a good book for the reluctant reader.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|I started to watch the movie a few weeks ago, and couldn't get past the first scenes of a Maserati racing through city streets, driven by a black man with an older bearded white man in the passenger seat. The dialogue in French with English subtitles made it even more difficult to latch onto the plot. I started again a few weeks later and became entranced with the story of Philippe and Driss.<br /><br />The real story starts to unfold when Driss is seated along a wall in a sumptuously decorated lobby, the only black man among an array of better dressed white men. He becomes impatient, storms into the inner office and insists that they sign his paper indicating that he had applied for a job, so that he could show it as proof in order to get on public assistance. He is told to come back the next day, and is hired on the spot to become the caregiver for Philippe, a wheelchair-bound wealthy paraplegic. All we know about Driss is that he has recently been released from jail after doing 6 months for theft and has been kicked out of his family home. He has no prior caregiver experience, but he is young and strong and does not treat Philippe like a pitiable invalid.<br /><br />Driss soon learns all of the daily tasks that he needs to perform to bathe, groom and feed Philippe and there are many humorous moments along the way. He never treats Philippe roughly, nor does he treat him like a frail old man. He makes mistakes, he curses unabashedly and he has a sense of wonder and awe at the rich, privileged world he has been plopped into. One day, when preparing to take Philippe for an outing, he refuses to take the wheelchair-accessible minivan and insists on driving the powerful, sleek Maserati instead. Philippe enjoys watching Driss' boyish excitement at piloting such a macho car, and they enjoy many rides together.<br /><br />Philippe also has a cadre of other assistants, including a secretary, house manager, business manager and gardener. Initially they all are very skeptical about the loud, crude, big black man that has moved in; however his boyish charm and enthusiasm soon weave their magic on them, and they learn to accept him. He adds so much life and humor to what had been a sad, quiet place. He teaches Philippe to find humor in his situation and even to laugh at himself from time to time. The backstory of both characters is revealed through many outings, adventures and conversations.<br /><br />Without revealing any more of the plot, I will just conclude that this is a joyful love story on many levels. The unlikely pairing of a rich, white, cultured handicapped man and a poor, uneducated and uncouth black man creates a unique relationship that benefits both men. \\"Intouchables\\" is based on a true story; otherwise you would not believe that such a rare relationship could develop and thrive. Their lives are forever changed for the better.l about the loud, crude, big black man that has moved in; however his boyish charm and enthusiasm soon weave their magic on them, and they learn to accept him.

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game is super fun and a really great time killer my friend showed this to me wonderful time so many different things to add on just an all around fun game
B003DTLUFO|5.0|Shopping on Amazon, I am always weary that I will come across bootleg, however this was not the case. Great figure, 3 faces to use, versions of the hair with and without the flame, a gun, a sword, multiple arms and hands, and good props for dynamic in air or on ground poses.<br />Looks great and the OVA it comes with is just as good as well. The DVD also has many language subtitles which I was happy with.<br />I would definitely recommend for anyone that buys anime products.
0307730697|5.0|Very moving story about a true hero.  Very deep story about courage to overcome addiction and other of life's hurdles.
B0057R5G6E|5.0|Great blue-ray collectors set of the smash hit &#34;Jurassic Park&#34; trilogy. Extra features abound, along with all new interviews and new thoughts about this amazing series.  Get it soon!
B0001AP12G|5.0|I've purchased every Kanye album on the release day except this. Finally have added it to my collection. He is one of, if not the, most influential/greatest artist of our time. &#34;Love your haters, they're your biggest fan.&#34; - KW
B006S08RLU|5.0|...this movie.  It is cute, funny, touching, well written and acted. It will probably always be in my top 10 favorites simply because it has all of the things I look for in a feel-good movie.  Don't let the subtitles deter you.
015206057X|5.0|I have purchased the Ten Little Fingers and Ten Little Toes for three of my great-grandchildren and it is a favorite.  The other books are great also.  One great-grandson just loves my cat and I sing a song I made up about my cat and his antics and Carter just loves the song and it soothes him whenever he is upset.
B003PIS5XI|4.0|WOW!! haven't seen this one in years, kinda cheesey but still a fun movie to watch, grandkids loved to watch it, had to watch at least three times in one day.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This is a great funny & clean family movie, great for kids!  My kids, ages 6-12, love this movie, as well as my husband and I!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Makes searching the web easier and web browsing faster. It is so easy that my 50 year old mom can use it.
B00428LIXO|3.0|good entertainment for children. A fun game, publishes various sounds, colorful. quality made. child happy. price is too high, it may cheaper.
B0051QIGP4|3.0|...but this is a pretty good song. Might find some others that I like. If I were 15 years younger, she might be the shizzle. lol
B00BUADSMQ|2.0|The action is one thing, however the humor of the older Die Hard films was taken out to be taken more serious approach in this one. It suffered and has many flaws about it but there isn't any funny moments. Again his famous phrase is cut short.<br />No I won't swear but I swear that the director has no idea how to handle this type of film.<br />Another point about it is that it's not in America, John isn't an CIA agent.<br /><br />I would so welcome the director from the first Die Hard to get these back on track.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|I like this game. The only thing is that you will need to add friends to battle with for first place. Its fun to win every week,  but it gets lonely at the top. :) I also like the new powerups they have in this game.
B00A0NOF7G|3.0|I enjoyed it,but it was too short of a story for my liking. I prefer a much longer and suspenseful book.  Parts of it was predictable
0062082353|5.0|God Bless Chris Kyle and all of the other hero's who have sacrificed and served to protect out great country.  I highly recommend this book!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love it! This is an awesome series and I can't wait to read the last book. I recommend this book to anyone
B000B8QEYC|3.0|...as I used to be. Still, it's good. And it's part of a collection. Gotta get it if you have the rest.
0786956291|5.0|Great box, a must-buy for everyone who wants to pick up Dungeons & Dragons.<br /><br />Great and fun content, could've countained more information about the races and classes.
B0038YWPZS|4.0|This movie is one of the great ones for me. I was happy to add this movie, but had a disappointing moment. If its called Limited Keepsake Edition you would expect to receive what is advertised... I unfortunately received a Dvd and nothing else. Be careful who you buy this from. Other then that - I love the movie.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I liked the movie but so much was left at and to much of nothing was put in.. it's a ok movie not one of my favorites.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Is it even possible for Clint Eastwood to disappoint?  I thought this movie was incredible.  Just when I think Clint can't do any better than previous movies, bam, he knocks it out of the park.  See what I did there?  I will watch this movie over and over without ever getting bored.
B00BWJ6JO4|4.0|The movie is n Line with &#34;Lord of the Ring&#34; excellent movie, I will wait the next (again a trilogy...!)
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this book!!! Sylvia Day is brilliant. She never disappoints. I think this book is better then the first 2, and I can't wait to read the next 2. So many emotions throughout this book. When an author can pull you into a story, and make you feel like you belong there, then you know it's a great story.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|There are still a few simple things I would like to see them add but overall it's a very good running app.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the most amazing game I have ever seen. It is like both the XBLA edition and pc. It is also like the piece edition. Thank you mojang!!!
B000DZIGDU|5.0|Great acting and characters-I never realized all the details of what the military actually sacrifice for US when they are away.  What and who they leave for so long and the strength of all involved. This movie should have won awards based on the incredible performance by Jamie Foxx.
B00CW665VI|4.0|This book was awesome and was told from a guy's point of view (the main character, Drew's point of view).  There were some part that literally made me laugh out loud and Katherine Brooks was just built to challenge Drew's every move in the book.  I read the sample first and I couldn't put it down.  I knew I had to get it!  It was a great read!
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Wish I could get those 3 hours back! Horrible movie, don't waste your time. The movie jumped all over the place. It didn't make sense throughout the whole movie.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is a great little app and really works well. Much better than the small battery icon that comes as standard. Really recommended.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Welcome this game is epic!! it's awesome and it has cool sell shaded graphics it's fun and for hardcore people you can turn aim assist off
B0085YOD1A|3.0|Does what it claims to do--makes a nice notification about the battery life.  Also displays the health of the battery.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|good fun game to play when you are bored with life it has some depth and is pretty good for a free Gama.
1781162646|5.0|If there was ever a book written for the summer, it would be JOYLAND by Stephen King. It is a beautiful, quietly riveting, multi-faceted work that holds your attention from the jump and evokes the sounds of Ferris wheels and the smells of popcorn and cotton candy from its first pages. There aren't any sentient choo-choos heading toward oblivion, clowns hiding under bridges, or dads going insane in out-of season tourist hotels. But the storytelling chops that those books and so many others exhibited are in full-on and full-bore display here, should you decide to step right up, ladies and gentlemen, and jump on board.<br /><br />JOYLAND is difficult to classify by genre. Though it is published under the venerable --- and absolutely indispensable --- Hard Case Crime imprint, it is not exactly a hard-boiled work, though there are elements of detective fiction within it. It is additionally a coming-of-age novel, a mystery, a romance, and has a touch of the horror and supernatural. King spends the first third of the book setting up a worn but beautiful set of dominoes into an unforgettable pattern.<br /><br />It begins in the summer of 1973 in a fictional North Carolina amusement park known as Joyland, a scant three miles from the equally fictitious but incredibly real town of Heaven's Bay. The story is narrated by Devin Jones, a college student who is on the cusp of having his heart broken by his girlfriend, Wendy Keegan. Note well: the early days of Joyland, where we get to know Devin and watch his relationship with Wendy go slowly off the rails, contains some of King's best writing to date by far --- and all without a hobgoblin in sight. Would I be wrong to put forth the proposition that most of us would rather face down a pack of vampires in Jerusalem's Lot than relive the loss of that first deep love? It's all right there in the first third or so of the book. Fortunately, life gets in the way, and for Devin, the prospect of working at Joyland and learning the art ofthe carnival serves as a buffer to the long-distance dumping he receives from Wendy.<br /><br />There are things to learn about the Ferris wheel, the games of chance, the carny lingo (known as \\"the Talk\\") and \\"wearing the fur,\\" the most dreaded job in the park. It is the latter where, ironically, Devin excels --- the hairshirt analogy may or may not have been deliberate on King's part, but there it is --- and he spends his days entertaining children and his lonely nights listening to Doors records. For a bit, anyway. Joyland, however, has an almost mythical mystery attached to it, one that attracts Devin in an irresistible way. It involves a funhouse and the long-ago murder of a woman whose restless spirit seems to manifest itself as it seeks someone to see that justice is done on her behalf.<br /><br />Yet the primary story of the novel involves the living, from minor yet unforgettable characters who wander into and out of the narrative, to a young, extremely ill boy and his mother, who slowly but irrevocably enter Devin's life and change it forever. By story's end --- a scant year or so after it begins --- everything has changed for Devin, and, as he demonstrates in the book, he feels the tug of those events some four decades later.<br /><br />JOYLAND is presently available only as a physical book and audiobook. This might seem like a publicity ploy, and indeed, that conclusion crossed my mind when I first learned the news. However, the story contained therein is one of those properly told on a page or by an actual voice; as each page turns, it is hard not to hear the sound of waves and the happy chatter of children, even as the frequently bittersweet events unfold. Even if you have never read a book by Stephen King, for whatever reason, you simply must put JOYLAND at the top of this summer's reading list.<br /><br />Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub

B004J4WLB4|5.0|An internet friend suggested this book... Hesitated but I bought it anyway. Once I started reading the first three chapters, I just had to keep on reading until I was finished.<br />It is good because I began to roll with the character. I adored her imperfections, strength, and passion. I hated guts and hard head at times. A heartfelt story of a little girl protecting her vulnerable self from getting anymore emotional wounds while she bounces between homes in the foster care system.<br />I thought however, that Victoria's character became disconnected in the end of the story, though it did not ruin the story. The ending was fairytale-ish and controversial. I spent days debating that IF the ending were true, happening to a real Victoria, consider the maternal choices that she made.. would she have my blessing or should I resent because I feel that her character knows better.
B007XIC1GI|3.0|It was interesting to learn about who Marilyn Manson really was. The book revealed things that quite disgusting to me.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|It was a little hard for me to follow at first.  When I got a bit into the book and got used to the style it was easy to keep track of.  I really did enjoy the book.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|This production is the best Phantom of the Opera ever!!!  Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess are amazing! I could watch this production everyday!
B004GCPJDQ|4.0|I was a little worried about this purchase because of the photos showing the wear that appears on the bottom of the battery pack. While this is purely aesthetic and does not affect the functionality, I've had my iMac approximately three weeks (one of which I did not even use the mouse) and a wear spot has already started appearing on the bottom of the battery pack.<br /><br />The concept is great and convenience is fantastic. If a little wear on the bottom doesn't bother you, definitely pick up this stylish and eco-friendly tool for your Magic Mouse.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This is the third book in the Crossfire novels.  I was highly disappointed when I heard many people were leaving one star reviews for this book after realizing the author was making this a five book series.  I feel that Sylvia Day has hit it out of the park again with the third book in the series and am more than excited to realize that I as a reader will be getting not one but two more books about Gideon Cross and Ava.<br /><br />This book picks up right after \\"Reflected In You,\\" and Ava is still trying to wrap her mind around the fact that Gideon killed for her.  The one person she needs to lean on is doing everything he can to keep his name cleared and that means taking extra steps to make people believe they are no longer a couple.  As they struggle to remain apart and hide their relationship all the people around them continue to make things harder for them.  Ava has a mother who still feels that she needs to track her daughter and her father just found out all of her secrets from when she was a child and it has left him devastated, fortunately for her she still has her best from Cary to lean on when he's not bouncing between the two people involved in his love life.  Gideon is dealing with Ava's ex-lover, his own ex-lover who refuses to move on from him, a news reporter scorned and looking for revenge and his own nightmares that still have not gone away.  Gideon and Ava have to learn to lean on each other and find their way out of this storm.<br /><br />*Gideon: \\"I look at you, angel, and I want you so badly.  I want to be with you, listen to you, talk to you.  I want to hear you laugh and hold you when you cry.  I want to sit next to you, breathe the same air, share the same life.  I want to wake up to you like this every day forever.  I want you.\\"<br />*Ava:  \\"He was taking me on a journey that had an unknown destination and I had agreed to follow him blindfolded.  It wasn't about where we'd end up as a couple, because that was never in question.  We were obsessed, dependent on each other in the unrelenting way of addicts.  Where I would end up, who I'd be at the end, was what I didn't know.\\"<br /><br />Ava and Gideon's love affair continues in the book and I flipped through the pages of this book just as fast as the others.  They may think they have found a happily ever after but there are still so many unanswered questions.  Where will the next book lead these two and who will be involved along the way?  I hope everyone will choose to ignore the one star reviews that are directly related to the fact that the author chose to continue the story past three books.  Take a chance and read this amazing book and rate it yourself.  I was truly happy with every page and rated this book a 4.5, I am highly anticipating the return of Gideon and Ava in the next book in the series.sessed, dependent on each other in the unrelenting way of addicts.

B005J3IEZQ|5.0|What do you say, a fantastic read, couldn't put it down. Learnt so much from it, interesting to learn how the Apple business started out and operated.
B008RF0M9O|4.0|I love my Sony MDR v6 headphones, but the ear cushions fall apart only after using for 6 months.<br />these replacement cusions fit right and look great.<br />They aren't as soft as the original, they are a little more firm, but still comfortable.<br />Also the lining that covers the actual speaker is thinner than the original,sligtly transparent so you can see the speaker.<br />Not sure if that changes the sound quality or not for the price $7-8 I can't complain.
B002WWKZJK|5.0|Vastly funny romp. The young Winwoods are full of mischief and always up to humorous larks. One scrape after another. Horry is a vastly different heroine for Heyer. Wanted to shake her many times during the story.
B00AZMFJYA|3.0|It may seem paradoxical to review a summer popcorn blockbuster movie for fans of serious cinema, but even we need our big budget action movie fix now & then. I'm not writing this for diehard Trekkies because they've already seen it and will buy the DVD--just look at all the glowing five-star reviews here.<br /><br />And for them I'm sure it is a 5-star movie. But I bet most of them haven't seen Kurosawa's [[ASIN:B000G8NXYG Seven Samurai (The Criterion Collection)]], the mother of all action movies, or Preston Sturges' [[ASIN:B001712130 Sullivan's Travels]], or possibly the scariest of all action movies, [[ASIN:B007Z9QP3K Das Boot]], or the sublime [[ASIN:B00005JLEU Spirited Away]], or...thousands of other great movies.<br /><br />That said, my spouse and I have seen all the Star Trek TV series and movies--along with [[ASIN:B001MM28JG Galaxy Quest]], the very funny sendup of both Star Trek and its cast and its most avid fans. We've also seen all the Star Wars movies. And TV series like FarScape, Babylon 5, Battlestar Galactica, Continuum, Lexx (the most un-Star Trekish of all TV scifi series), Game of Thrones, Vikings, everything Joss Whedon has ever helmed...so we are big fans of scifi/fantasy stuff.<br /><br />My spouse & I saw Star Trek/Into Darkness last night at the local cineplex in 2D from ideal seats. And both as Star Trek fans (though not superfans) and as movie buffs, we were underwhelmed. Wasn't bad, wasn't great, wasn't memorable.<br /><br />A fair comparison would be with Joss Whedon's [[ASIN:B008NCSZQ8 Marvel's The Avengers]]. Avengers delivered all the popcorn thrills & chills that STID does, but with much more memorable characters, screenwriting, mise en scene, AND without stealing most of its ideas from other movies.<br /><br />In a way you'd be best off seeing STID if you hadn't seen any Star Trek movies or TV episodes, because this is big budget fan fiction, full of references, characters, and even plotlines from other movies--mostly Star Trek, but at least one action sequence from Star Wars. I'm not griping about Kirk/Spock/Uhuru/Scotty/Doc being there. I'm griping about the movie rehashing old Star Trek shows instead of giving us something new and worthy of a series reboot.<br /><br />On the plus side, we get Benedict Cumberbatch, the imposing Brit who stars in BBC's modern day retelling of Sherlock Holmes. When he's onscreen the other characters become kind of transparent (metaphorically speaking). And STID's casting is OK. Chris Pine's Cap'n Kirk certainly inhabits the uniform with the same bravado (and less hamminess) than his predecessor. Good Spock. Zoe Saldana's Lt. Uhuru is an improvement on the original. Less successful were Doc and Scotty.<br /><br />But the real problem is that experienced Trek viewers have seen this movie before, one way or another. In a country with 310 million people, surely one can cook up an original Star Trek screenplay. Whedon took just as heavy a load of backstory and made an original movie out of it. Abrams has not.<br /><br />I don't understand why this doesn't bother the Trekkies writing reviews here more than it did. The last straw was weaving the original Star Trek TV show thems music into the thunderous but unmemorable orchestral score for this one, during the closing credits. It was jarringly mismatched to the contemporization of this movie.<br /><br />Unlike others here, I preferred the first Star Trek series reboot movie with the same main characters. It seemed less derivative and more fresh start-y.<br /><br />But regardless of whether my spouse and I liked it, should YOU get the DVD and see it?<br /><br />As I said, if you're a Trekkie completest that's a no-brainer.<br /><br />If you're a Trekkie-light kinda person like my spouse and me (saw all the previous Trek stuff but don't go to conventions and don't live & breathe it), prrrrobably yes. Just don't get your expectations up too high.<br /><br />And surprisingly, I think it'll work better on a TV screen thanin the theater. I realize this is counterintuitive when it comes to big budget action movies. But JJ Abrams shot it for the TV screen: seems like half the film is count-the-pores extreme close-ups of people's faces. This is fine on a TV screen, which supports close and medium-distance shots best. In the theater--even from our ideal seats--it was sort of invasive. If you're planning on seeing it in a theater, I'd recommend sitting towards the back, contrary to where I'd sit for a movie really designed for the theater.<br /><br />My favorite scene in Avengers was where Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow is talking to Loki when they have him imprisoned. He doesn't realize she's actually interrogating him to find out what he knows that they need to know. The scene is subtle and rests on Johansson's low-keyed but considerable acting talent. I mention this because there's nothing like this in STID. STID puts everything in bright primary colors. Apparently they didn't have a big enough budget for subtlety.<br /><br />Another recent big-budget sci-fi blockbuster, [[ASIN:B003EVWDR0 Avatar]], was not a film my spouse and I carry around in our hearts like we do truly great movies, but overall it was considerably better than Star Trek Into Darkness. More original screenplay, more interesting visuals, more engaging storyline. Except for Benedict Cumberbatch and his character. He was more memorable than his counterpart in Avatar, I admit. He was also more memorable than his counterpart in Avengers. He really has a compelling presence.<br /><br />Note that I'm not comparing Star Trek Into Darkness with, say, Let Me In, the wonderful American remake of the similarly named Swedish vampire movie, starring an amazing 12 year old Chloe Grace Moretz. Or with the True Grit remake. You could say both those films have different audiences.<br /><br />But this film's audience--outside diehard Trekkies--is the same as for Avengers and Avatar and other blockbusters that aren't scifi even. Against them, and outside any commitment you might have to the Star Trek franchise, this is just an OK movie. I don't think the cast is to blame for this. It's the director, who just isn't as good a movie director as Cameron or Whedon.<br /><br />I have more specific complaints but I promised a no-spoilers review, so those must wait. One hint though: Benedict Cumberbatch's character's name doesn't fit him at all. Seems like a minor point, but get enough of them and they start to add up to breaking the fourth wall. At least all the characters play it straight--no nudge nudge wink wink moments in the film. That would have been the kiss of death.<br /><br />Lastly, though, the movie ends on a SEQUEL COMING SEQUEL COMING note, so if you're planning on seeing the next in the series you'll need to see this so you know what's going on. Just see it on DVD instead of in the theater, with a computer or smart phone handy to tide you over the slow parts...in the theater.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! Please don't make me wait another year to learn more about Eva and Gideon,and Cary!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like this app, I find it very fun and I love horses not to mention the awesome graphics!
B00CW665VI|5.0|First off: this story being told from the guy's POV - GENIUS!  What a guy he is too - full of himself and a player without remorse.  That he had no intention of getting caught by any woman just made it all the sweeter when an unwitting female catches his attention and that female really doesn't want a jerk like Drew Evans.  That female - Kate Brooks - she's actually Drew's match in every way and once he realizes it......he is both intrigued and challenged.  Kate for her part: very intelligent, unassuming, and engaged to another guy.<br /><br />I love the evolutionary process Drew goes through that takes him from major jack-off-player who won't spend more than one night with a woman........to the committed man in love who fights for the woman he knows he has to have in his life.  It's a VERY painful process and we lucky readers are with him (and his thoughts) from beginning to end.<br /><br />This story entertained me as much as WALLBANGER did......and that was an equally wonderful story.  This book is definitely one I'll keep and reread at least once a year - it's that special.<br /><br />Highly recommended.......if you're looking to laugh your head off, become outraged with how Drew thinks, feel sorry for the jerk when things don't go his heart's way.......and finally........cheer him on when he manages to find a way back into Kate's galaxy.  This story takes the reader through all kinds of emotions.  Wonderfully written.  Thank you!
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|My wife asked for the CD but I am the one who likes it. His voice is still good and the songs are new but.with an old feel. I recommend it for old Rod Stewart fans!
B00140PK6O|5.0|I bought this for my elderly mother, who is an Anglophile.  It's a sweet, gentile story, with enough action to be exciting.  Acting is superb, as are the costumes and settings.  Gaskell's stories are subtly witty and insightful, and this is a good adaptation of several of them.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|George R. R. Martin's character's are highly relatable and the drama and action never stops. Game of Thrones is a top-knotch medieval fantasy story and it's incredibly difficult to predict the plot twists.
B0034JKZ86|2.0|It is very disappointing to received a copy of a movie rather than an authentic disney dvd, the quality is poor and I am sad that Amazon sells these illegal copies
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I received the book the day it was released and looked at the reviews.  I almost returned based on all the criticism.  I don't know what everyone is upset about???  The book was AWESOME!!  I, too, thought the series would conclude with this book but am happy there are more to come.  This book brought new characters, built on old characters, and made you want to read more but not in an 'angry that I have to wait a few months kind of way.'  Overall, excellent...you will not be disappointed.
B00CC1JXYE|4.0|Good quality and fit.  Automatic functions all work when opening and closing cover. Civer does not add any additional bulk.
B00AK57N00|5.0|Fun time waster. You swing on a rope and try to land on a small target the closer you get the more points you get.  Wind and gravity change some times to add to the challenge.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Please give me more. I enjoy this story. It wrapped up so many unanswered questions.  Now if you are new to the series you can't start here. You will be forever lost and totally pissed.  But if you are a follower you will know how good this book was and some of you will be shock and will just scream I told you. I was shock and had to heard I told you but it doesn't matter being shocked is what made it soon very good.<br /><br />More more is all I can ask for.  I missed the wolves and I'm looking forward the birth of Mercy plugins.
0399159347|5.0|The Husband's Secret<br />by<br />Liane Moriarty<br /><br />My &#34;in a nutshell&#34; summary...<br /><br />Three women whose lives entwine and unravel because of a secret letter written by one husband.<br /><br />My thoughts after reading this book...<br /><br />What a book!  This is my first book by this author and what an introduction!<br /><br />Tess, Cecilia and Rachel...seemingly different unconnected lives but the way this author reveals their connections is unbelievable.  Tess...dealing with a dishonest husband...Rachel...dealing with the years old unsolved death of her daughter...Cecilia...dealing with a mysterious letter from her husband that will change the lives of everyone.  A letter which he tells her not to open and which she opens anyway.  Oh me oh my!<br /><br />I was...and you will be...entranced with this story and the way the secret is revealed and the unbelievable way that everyone is affected.<br /><br />What I loved about this book...<br /><br />I loved so many of the characters.  From shy socially inept Tess to the lovely principal of Tess's son's new school...there were so many fascinating characters.  My favorite part of this book was the EPILOGUE.  The way the author explained the what might have beens was sheer perfection.<br /><br />What I did not love...<br /><br />Of all the characters and situations that they were in...I didn't like Tess's husband Will nor did I like her cousin Felicity.  I also did not like Cecilia's husband,  John Paul...who is the cause of everything that happened.<br /><br />Final thoughts...<br /><br />I found this to be a deeply fascinating book.  I loved this author's writer's style.  I loved this book!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This was a free app of the day. It's much better than a different app that i paid for previously. I actually use this app.
B00AK57N00|3.0|Today's free app of the day for June 9, 2013 from the Amazon app store is Mr. AahH!! from PONOS.<br /><br />This game is a simple jump from one platform to the next until you lose all your lives.  There are different colors on the platform.  Depending on the color of the spot you land on, you get fewer or more points.  That is about all there is to the game.  Younger players or much older players wanting a simple and easy game to understand and to play will probably like this game quite a bit over those wanting a somewhat sophisticated challenge.<br /><br />I, however, found the game to be rather repetitive after playing a few times.  This game would have probably been somewhat better if there were more features added such as moving platforms or hoops that you have to jump through.<br /><br />I reviewed a game from Amazon's app store last year called Polara which is another timing based game which I enjoyed much more than this game since it involved more elements to avoid than Mr. AahH!! does.  I would recommend that game instead over this one.<br /><br />And I want to mention that even though AndroidTapp picked Mr. AahH as one of their best game app picks for their monthly picks last month, I still think this is not one of the best apps out there.  AndroidTapp has not reviewed many great apps such as Super Stickman Golf, Sudoku 10'000, Polara, or Gunman Clive, so they need to figure out why they are overlooking several great game apps and recommending an average one like Mr. AahH.<br /><br />Since this game is just OK and becomes somewhat repetitive and lacks game playing elements that would have made the game more fun, I am giving this app 3 out of 5 stars.
B004Q7DQLS|4.0|I thought the premise was engaging and the book kept you enthralled throughout the entire process. Would read another of these books from this author.
B002RI9ZUE|4.0|This  well written book shows  how a young, brilliant American student gradually loses her sanity while trying to escape the stereotypes that American society in the early sixties wants to impose on her. She wants to be herself, but becomes the victim of men in particular (but not only). Although this theme is not especially original,  the description  of  her feelings,  her emotions, and her growing insanity is particularly vivid, precise and convincing. We see things from her point of view, with the help of a very concrete style and rich vocabulary.  This book has helped me to realise how and why  mental illness can entrap even a very  intelligent person, into doing terrible, self-destructive  things against her own will, eventually leading her to try and commit suicide. The young woman is caught inside &#34; the bell jar&#34; of mental illness lust like a patient who becomes the victim of  a physical disease such as cancer. However,  treating this type of disease seems a daunting, perhaps impossible, task. This book reminded me of  &#34;Family Life&#34;,  a moving  film realised  by Ken Loach  in 1971 on a fairly similar theme,

B008JJM88Q|5.0|I fell in love with Akinator online ages ago. Having the mobile app is the best and worst thing to ever happen to my phone. I've wasted quite a bit of time on this app already. It's a great conversation piece at the pub. This game is mind blowing. It's ridiculously hard to fool the Akinator. I got this as the free app of the day, but had I known it was a mobile app beforehand I would have paid full price anyway. I love Akinator!  &nbsp;
B00BY8DIT2|2.0|Love Bonamassa.  Love Hart.  Love their first album together.<br /><br />Don't love this album.  It lacks soul.  It sounds like they squeezed in two days from their respective touring schedules, casually knocked out a few tunes, and turned it over to the producer to finish (whose glitzy add-ons - notably horns - make the uninspired covers sound even worse.)  That may not be the case, but it sure sounds like it.
1451627289|4.0|I bought this just because of the topic. I've never been a huge Stephen King fan, but I still read his books. I didn't know what to expect of this book and was pleasantly surprised.<br />My only complaint is it starts to get slow in the middle. He could have cut out maybe 100 pages and it would have still be a good book
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|It is great to be able to hear the songs from the show.  Have it in my car and enjoy every moment of listening to it.

B00CB4ET0K|5.0|This is a great game! I recommend this app if you like war. It's way better than<br />The first frontline commando. You should totally get this if you like war!!!<br />IT'S GREAT!!!!!!!!!!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I got this app as the free app of the day but I would pay full price in a heartbeat. Not only does it have a great selection of sounds, you can mix and match as many as you want! I have tried quite a few white noise apps but this one has by far the most features. On top of the mix and match you can control the volume of both individual sounds but the overall volume as well. App includes binaural beats too! I'm a nanny so this app comes in handy for naps on the go. Turn it on and stick it in the stroller head rest and boom, insta-sleep. Don't bother with any other white noise app, this is all you'll ever need!
0345505387|4.0|i've recently read the first book in the outlander series, and got this as something to do on a Friday evening. Well written, the art is fantastic.
0375869026|5.0|Beautiful story...great read aloud for a family, ages 10-13..a lot of opportunities for discussion about compassion, empathy, and kindness to others.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|Just started to play and was asked to review already.  The game is straight forward, you drive a car and collect gas and coins.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The story is quite simple but makes you read quickly. The sex is boring after a while as there is no new ideas. The characters seem to be confused and do not stick to what they really want.
0307951529|5.0|great book! wonderful examples on ordinary people that identified a need that could be fulfilled and a simplistic way to deliver! Highlights key points at the end of each chapter. Very well written and fun to read.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|I guess now I know that there will be another part to this--but I didn't when i ordered.  Anyway, pretty good as to the book--which I read 30 years ago--sometimes, a little too much computer graphics, and the story line is a little uhmm, wavy.  But, as a long time Tolkien fan, very glad to see it put into film--although it should have bee done first!!!  Ian was very believable as  the young Bilbo.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|this one kind of does the stephen king wrap it up at the end thing.<br />happily ever after and all that jazz.<br /><br />the first one is why there's all the buzz.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Good movie,  had to buy it after watching it via Netflix.  Love that this copy came with a digital copy.
B001I45UFC|5.0|I gave this book five stars become it is that good and more. If there were more stars I would give this more.<br />What I like about this book is the adventures that happen in a world other than our world. I love how time is so different in Narnia. I love stories where good over comes evil, and all the wrongs are put right.<br />What I dislike about the book is that it ended...They were kings and queens and lived a long time in Narnia and than they went through the wardrobe and once again where children.<br />I think anyone who is young at heart and who loves adventures would love this book and would look forward to reading the next book!

Hearing the album on vinyl is such an incredible experience and while the master isn't as great as the digital version, it certainly is still better than 99.9% of all other albums I've heard on vinyl.<br /><br />As a track by track review, not much can be said that hasn't already been said so instead I'll just rate all of the songs out of 10 and say my favourite part of it.<br /><br />Dark Fantasy - 10/10<br />Gorgeous - 10/10<br />Power - 10/10<br />All of the Lights - 10/10<br />Monster - 10/10<br />So Appalled - 8/10<br />Devil in a New Dress - 6/10<br />Runaway - 10/10<br />Hell of a Life - 9/10<br />Blame Game - 10/10<br />Lost In The World - 10/10<br /><br />Highlights: Production throughout<br />Runaway.<br />Nicki Minaj's verse on Monster<br />All of the Lights' interlude<br />Chris Rock's skit on Blame Game<br />Kanye's verse on Lost in the World

B005S9EK5Y|3.0|I expected more. The singing was inferior except for Jackman. I thought the beginniiing of the movie was dark and dirty. I  I hate dark movies like the latest Batman. The second part did not belong to the first part.

Even though it was a good idea for a Superman story I just could not get a feel for the story. The drawing looks to be newspaper like and felt the story was outdated and the characters shallow. I cannot recommend buying this book.

0765325950|4.0|Note: I originally wrote this review for TarValon.Net and it was published in their newsletter, the Tar Valon Times.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />Like all fangirls/boys, I obsessed. For years. Repeatedly. What did I want in the last book of the Wheel of Time? I had an inkling that good would win in the end, but I had no clue whether my favorite people would survive, which caused endless brooding over months and years.<br /><br />I live in a semi-reality where a fictional character is basically a lower ranking real human. Lan Mandragoran's life was more important to me than vanquishing the Dark One. And what about my favorite Amyrlin? Egwene became undiluted awesome as of Knife of Dreams and I was eager to read her conclusion. And what about those Reds at the Black Tower facing off against the male channelers? Let the Aes Seduction commence. (I know. I am sorry.)<br /><br />I had a thought to wait until the ebook released a few months later, since almost all the books I read are ebooks these days. That thought lasted about four seconds. Waiting months was unbearable (#firstworldproblems). I decided to responsibly wait until my housemate finished her copy and borrow from her.<br /><br />Release day arrived, happening to coincide with my day off. I swiped the book from her while she worked, cackling at my villainy. When she stopped working and expected the book back, I actually moaned at the pain of separation. She took pity on me and we drove to Barnes and Noble, where I happily forked over $25. I haven't paid so much for a book since...the last Wheel of Time book came out (also bought on release day after swearing I would wait until paperback).<br /><br />The experience was worth the price. I can't remember the last time I was so constantly delighted reading a book, and I read about two hundred books a year. So there's your disclaimer: I'm a Wheel of Time fangirl of the most addictive variety. Sincerely and without irony, I consider myself a Brown Aes Sedai. I have three shawls and wish I had more. (It's like shoes. You need a formal, an informal and an extra to lend a friend, plus others to match your mood.) I have strong opinions about fiction and criticize when I see it but overall, I am on the book's side because it brings me such joy.<br /><br />So. Let's get to the actual content of our last Wheel of Time book. It's a sign of my Brown Aes Sedai-ness that I didn't understand what people meant when they spoke of long chapters and said, \\"Wait until you reach chapter thirty-seven.\\" Titled \\"The Last Battle,\\" it was abnormally long for a Sanderson novel but consistent for a Jordan novel. About eight million pages in length, chapter thirty-seven went on and on and I didn't realize this until I'd finished and flipped back after hearing people gripe. I was in the moment. I had no idea when chapters started and ended; I just wanted more story. It worked for me. Let each chapter be novel length, so long as the pacing works. Pacing is more a Sanderson strength than a Jordan one, a fact for which I've been grateful in these recent books--though it's worth noting that Knife of Dreams was reasonably well-paced as well.<br /><br />Brandon Sanderson's writing has improved. His dialogue is more natural, he uses fewer exclamation points and his characters don't refer to each other by name on every page anymore. That irked me in the last couple Wheel of Time books and in his own books.<br /><br />Even so, we had some stilted sentences in this book. For instance: \\"The other five were all Wise Ones, naked--as was Aviendha--after the manner of sweat tents.\\" We've long known the manner of sweat tents, so that was unneeded. The sentence itself had awkward syntax. The reading could have been smoother.<br /><br />However, in honesty, these are nitpicking points. I rarely had style issues with A Memory of Light. I should also confess that my faith in Sanderson's writing ability is immense and The Way of Kings is my favorite fantasy book, bar none.<br/><br />One of the first things I did upon receiving A Memory of Light was flip to the last page. I didn't want spoilers but I wanted to confirm what I'd hoped would be the last sentence of the series. It was. I was pleased. Back to the beginning.<br /><br />I am not a fan of Wheel of Time prologues. I remember two prologues I loved: Eye of the World and Knife of Dreams. The former gave us that rare glimpse of the Age of Legends (and sexy beast evil philosopher, Ishamael). The latter gave us Galad's triumph, shocking news about the royal family of Seanchan and other excitement. Besides those two, I look upon these prologues as laundry I must fold before I get to wear my brand new awesome outfit. That laundry, it takes a long time to fold.<br /><br />I could have done without almost the entire prologue. Isam's part was important-ish, though the Samma n'Sei felt dropped into the plot without notice. I liked that they did something with the Aiel male channelers, but I wish they'd shown up sooner. This was a terrifying, sad way to re-address that thread but by only bringing them in at the end, when it's not truly important to the overall scheme, it seemed extraneous.<br /><br />The Forsaken tea party served to show that the Dark Lord pushed Graendal into a new, uglier body. Mazrim Taim became a newly minted Forsaken, M'Hael. Other than that, all was predictable. Demandred leads an army of evilness, check. Moghedien hates Moridin, check. Moridin is cruel, apathetic and in charge. Check.<br /><br />The Talmanes plot bored me; I didn't feel anything was significant about it except later on in the book, where Nynaeve marveled at Moiraine's ability to heal Tam's Thakan'dar wound years ago. Leilwin/Egeanin and Bayle Domon have never been my favorite characters but Leilwin's assistance to Egwene throughout the book was resourceful, so I guess that part was okay. But all in all, not a fan of the prologue.<br /><br />I enjoyed the pairing of Pevara and Androl throughout the book. Pevara was always my favorite Red, though we've met few up close and none so nice as Pevara. She's an obvious favorite. Teamed together with Androl, they explored a new bonding experience, freed the Black Tower from our new Forsaken and generally were awesome. We saw more into Androl's character, a free spirit rolling through life, excited by new experiences and willing to try most things once. Before, I only remembered him as some random male channeler with a gift for gateways. I enjoyed the innovative ways he employed his Talent, snapping open locks with mini gateways and such.<br /><br />One of my main wishes was to see Moiraine return in glory. I was not disappointed. On the edge of my seat, I watched Moiraine command a room of kings and queens, of Aes Sedai and the Dragon Reborn himself. As a young Accepted, she witnessed Gitara Moroso's fatal prophecy hailing his rebirth. From that moment, she devoted her life to finding the Dragon, to helping him lead the world and save it. This was her moment. The most infamous Aes Sedai is returned in full and hallelujah. We've only waited a decade.<br /><br />I admired the usage of the Aiel in the contract, to make them the enforcers of the Dragon's law. Although they live by their honor, everyone knows not to screw with an Aiel. Having left the Waste, their new place in the world fits in perfectly with this new Age. One imagines that in time, Aviendha's viewing will come true as they fade into that remnant of a remnant, forgetting ji'e'toh. And then, time for Ghoetam under the tree of life, for Mosk the giant, for giraffes and the Mercedes Benz. And then, time for channelers to re-emerge. Time for the Aiel to be reborn as servants of the Servants. Time for the Dragon.<br /><br />I wanted, irrationally, for Rand to have his hand back. Of all the horrors he's faced, I fretted most over his lost hand, what this would do to his confidence after the author pulled a George R. R. Martin and he couldn't sword fight. The scenebetween Tam and Rand, sword fighting, was a beautiful moment. You can be outstanding at something and still fail if your fortune takes an abrupt nosedive. You can stop failing if you stop feeling sorry for yourself. You are able to do wonderful, awe-inspiring things but they require that you stop giving up and start trying. We would see this theme again: you never give up. He needed his father (or Lan) to teach him this.<br /><br />I wanted, wildly wanted, Lan to live. Other characters, even my favorite characters (he is #5) could die and I'd be okay. Two of them ended up dying and I loved their deaths. The despair I felt at the concept of Lan's inevitable demise broke my heart. I wished he could see a renewed Malkier. I wished him triumph against impossible odds. So it's no surprise that when I read Rand say, \\"There is a dear friend who needs us,\\" my eyes turned wide and my mouth dropped open. They remembered, they remembered him! A hundred thousand men added to his army of six thousand soldiers doomed to death at Tarwin's Gap and I broke down for the first time in my reading.<br /><br />On release day, I sat across from my housemate at a pub, each of us reading our own hardback copies. I was a hundred pages ahead of her. I tried to disguise my feelings as I read on but when those gateways opened at Tarwin's Gap, my composure shattered and I was left gasping, attempting to disguise what I was feeling so I wouldn't spoil her, holding my hands over my face, wiping away tears. She thought a character had died. I was unable to correct her assumption for at least five seconds, blubbering, shaking my head. I finally blurted out that it was a good thing, not a death.<br /><br />Lan is a character I always wanted to triumph. Harsh and serious, I wanted Nynaeve to soften him, make him happy. She couldn't do that if he was dead. They'd just scratched the surface on his potential for happiness after decades of unending, mountain-heavy duty. I needed to see others honor him for his unbending core of morality. They did across the entire series, but never so much as in this moment here.<br /><br />Padan Fain's end was disappointing. His literary value was in his chaotic contributions to the story. Throughout the series, he popped up randomly, screwing things up in unexpected ways for all. I expected him to play a gollum-like role in the story. His death was anticlimactic and he contributed almost nothing to the plot. Disappointment.<br /><br />Perrin. What exactly was his purpose in this book? I thought perhaps he would, as a blacksmith, remake the seals on the prison. I guess not. He guarded things from Tel'aran'rhiod and brought the wolves. I suppose the wolves were important. (You know what I would have adored? Hopper returning with the Horn's blow. I guess we can't have everything.) Still, I couldn't help but feel something lacking in Perrin's passages. I didn't like the Cyndane factor and all his Dreaming talents seemed stumbled upon and therefore not earned.<br /><br />Did you ever trust Lanfear/Cyndane? Anyone? Actually, I like 'Mierin' best. It sums up who she really is: a curious, selfish human who accidentally broke the world with her Age of Legends research and kept breaking it through her own twisted need for power. Her tunnel vision was her fatal flaw. She could have been redeemed so many times. Every member of the Forsaken could have been redeemed, but they held something more important.<br /><br />For Mierin, a woman helpless in her obsession with a man who would never appreciate her, it was power. She dreamed of an unattainable world where she could not be denied and all would fear her, so she would never be laid low again. She turned against Moridin when he put her in her place, lowest of the Forsaken. She had always been blind to anything that did not serve herself, as all the Forsaken were ultimately for themselves. Those who believed in serving others rather than just themselves were on the opposite side of the battlefield.<br /><br />Mat had my favorite plot line throughout the book. I was always upset when his part ended, flipping ahead to see when his next part started (while attempting to avoid all spoilers; I just wanted the page number so I could anticipate Mat's next turn). I liked how he handled the Empress, may she live forever, and how she handled him.<br /><br />I wanted the glorious moment where Mat would sound the Horn of Valere. I guess I'll have to re-read Book Two for that one. But I cried when Jain Farstrider came back to help Olver. It was perfect; almost enough to make up for the fact that Mat was no longer the appointed Hornblower. I'll admit I forgot about that convenient return-to-life-by-balefire-takebacks plot point all those books ago. Well played, Mr. Jordan. Well played. Anyway, this need to see Mat sound the horn stemmed out of a wish to see him appreciated by the Seanchan as valuable and legendary. In the last book, they started looking on him as a military genius and he solidified that here in a celebrated fashion.<br /><br />I loved that Tuon (I really don't want to call her Fortuona) and Egwene didn't get along. They aren't supposed to. They were my two favorites, now that Verin was gone (no one can top Verin for me) and they despised each other. It was fantastic. Each was true to her character and culture. Tuon and Egwene would never be friends. Tuon was a stuck up, narrow-minded bitch. It served her well as the Empress, may she live forever. I wish I knew what happened next for Mat and Tuon.<br /><br />I always wondered just what the Flame of Tar Valon might mean. All the other titles the Amyrlin trails behind her are comprehensible. The Flame of Tar Valon was more esoteric than functional--until now. While I'll admit to not being 100% enthralled on the repeated 'Flame of Tar Valon' notion Egwene thought to herself during her sacrifice (though, hey, do what you gotta do if it helps you make peace with your own end), I was entirely bewitched by her death. The Wheel of Time began with Lews Therin giving all the Saidin he had and more, going explodey and producing a mountain in a major element of the world's Breaking. The series ended with Egwene giving all the Saidar she had and more, going explodey and producing a column of crystal in order to heal the world's fissures created by balefire.<br /><br />We have balance. We have beauty. We have a character who started as a young teenage girl, unsure of her place in the world but knowing she was something more than everyone expected of her. She was kidnapped by the enemy, she became an apprentice of the Aiel and she was thrust into a position she didn't wholly want. She led the rebel Tower and was arguably one of the best prisoners of war I've seen depicted in fiction. \\"Honey in the Tea\\" from Knife of Dreams might be my favorite chapter in the whole series. Egwene wore the shawl with strength and majesty. She gave her entire being to ensure the world's safety. You cannot ask for more from an Amyrlin or from any person. Would you sacrifice your existence to save everyone else's, or would you pass that role to another? Her sense of duty was every bit as strict as Lan's or Rand's. She did what needed doing. Epic. Win.<br /><br />Bao the Wyld, who would slay the Dragon, was finally revealed as Demandred's front persona all the way from crazysauce Shara. He gave some comic relief in his fixed attitude of the beast on the mountaintop, shouting to all, over and over. He also provided one of the most captivating questions during the Last Battle: who would slay this beast? For every single attempt, I felt it could happen.<br /><br />Admittedly, less so with Gawyn, that halfwit of a Warder. I used to love Gawyn. L-O-V-E love. I think the anticipation of will-they-or-won't-they captivated me more than the numbskull he became after bonding and marrying Egwene. His actions throughout this book seemed uncharacteristic to me. I was disappointed to find him so irrational and unhelpful. His last conversation with Galad was poignant, though, where he admitted that, as always, Galad was just better than him. It's been an issue for him his entire life and it's why it took so long for him to man up with Egwene. Fitting that it would be what he clings to as he dies.<br /><br />Because Gawyn failed and died, I felt Galad had a good chance of killing Demandred. After all, he was the most gifted swordsman ever, right? He beat the Lord Captain Commander. He beat everyone he ever met. He would avenge his brother and all would feel just in the world. But Demandred had centuries to train at swordsmanship and Galad was so young. He was not ready. Seeing him defeated, I accepted that fate for him. It felt true. But who was left to rid the world of the terror on the mountaintop?<br /><br />As a writer, you learn to set up expectations and fulfill them in unexpected ways. An unexpected conclusion is exciting. Still, those unexpected ways must be intuitive and natural so the reader accepts the plot's course as plausible. Of course Gawyn would fail. Of course, in hindsight, Galad would fail. But take the most badass Gaidin of all time, who trained his entire life to die in honor. A man held in the highest esteem for his valor, for his persistence and excellence as a warrior by all who meet him. A king who is a nation all unto himself. A living legend who would raise an army just by walking through town after town, without saying a word. (Nynaeve redeemed herself forever in my eyes when she dropped Lan off on the opposite side of the world, telling him to march the whole way to his battle.) Set him up against the most terrifying Forsaken, except at times Moridin, and see what happens.<br /><br />\\"I am the man who will kill you\\" is as epic as it gets. Lan remains my favorite Gaidin of all time.<br /><br />Finally, we have Rand's conclusion.<br /><br />I wanted Rand to somehow live, though I'd have been okay with his dying, too; it was just a hopeful preference. I'm still not fully on board for the perplexing body switch but my instincts accept the situation anyway. I wanted him to live and he has. I am so glad he has two hands again. I hope he is able to raise his children, live in peace and see his contract fulfilled by the people of Randland. Also, pretty face. Just sayin'.<br /><br />Since he laughed at the end of The Gathering Storm and found serenity within himself for his part in the world's fate, he has been twelve times less irritating. He had to get over a lot of insecurities, frustrations and angst. He had to become a man ready to give up everything to keep goodness in this world.<br /><br />And really, that's all it takes. Strive for goodness and goodness remains. That is how he defeated the Dark One: he refused to admit defeat. He kept hope for the world and hope was all that was needed. Robert Jordan wove the message throughout the whole series. Darkness was never in control. That was just a lie told by the Father of Lies.<br /><br />I was thrilled to see, \\"I win again, Lews Therin,\\" pop up in the last book twice. \\"I WIN. AGAIN.\\" The timing was perfect. It's been with us since The Great Hunt and it is one of my favorite lines. The Dark One seems to have constructed this recurrent slap in the face to make Rand doubt his strength. Another deception. It's hard to turn that taunt aside after hearing it so long and often, but that is what the Dragon has to do. He has to succeed in every turn of the Wheel. He has to see the Light concealed within the dark. As the Creator told Rand, \\"HE IS OF ME,\\" a nice cameo from a major player we hadn't heard from since The Eye of the World. Good and evil are two sides of one coin but it's a lucky weighted coin with advantage to the good guys. Evil becomes the master only when goodness is no longer championed. Wielding the blade Callandor helps, too.<br /><br />Every Darkfriend in this series fought solitary battles at the mercy of Darkfriends crueler than they were. They could fall at a moment's notice. The Dark One never forgave and never sympathized. Every Darkfriend lived with terror always in the background of their mind because they believed mankind was ultimately wicked. They did not recognize the sheer power of goodness and therefore could not benefit from it.<br /><br />This concept of perseverance through darkness struck in powerful fashion when we saw the hundred thousand and six fighting at Tarwin's Gap. The entire Borderland converged upon the hope of taking back their land, of fighting against the ever-gaining borders of the Blight approaching from their own backyard. They witnessed an overwhelming darkness as it consumed their homeland, closer and closer every year. Finally, they came together to say that it didn't matter that they would lose. It did not matter that they would die.<br /><br />What mattered was that they fought against the evil and never gave up hope. As the Aiel said, \\"'Till shade is gone, 'till water is gone, into the Shadow with teeth bared, screaming defiance with the last breath, to spit in Sightblinder's eye on the last day.\\" We do not admit defeat to evil. We hear from all sides, \\"I WIN. AGAIN. THE FIGHT IS OVER.\\" And we answer, as Rand did, that it has not yet begun. There is light if we search for it. Our mere refusal to let darkness win saves us.<br /><br />Thank you, Robert Jordan, for giving us this testimony.eld.<br /><br />Mat had my favorite plot line throughout the book. I was always upset when his part ended, flipping ahead to see when his next part started (while attempting to avoid all spoilers; I just wanted the page number so I could anticipate Mat's next turn).

Just sayin'.<br /><br />Since he laughed at the end of The Gathering Storm and found serenity within himself for his part in the world's fate, he has been twelve times less irritating. He had to get over a lot of insecurities, frustrations and angst. He had to become a man ready to give up everything to keep goodness in this world.<br /><br />And really, that's all it takes. Strive for goodness and goodness remains. That is how he defeated the Dark One: he refused to admit defeat. He kept hope for the world and hope was all that was needed. Robert Jordan wove the message throughout the whole series. Darkness was never in control. That was just a lie told by the Father of Lies.<br /><br />I was thrilled to see, \\"I win again, Lews Therin,\\" pop up in the last book twice. \\"I WIN. AGAIN.\\" The timing was perfect. It's been with us since The Great Hunt and it is one of my favorite lines. The Dark One seems to have constructed this recurrent slap in the face to make Rand doubt his strength. Another deception. It's hard to turn that taunt aside after hearing it so long and often, but that is what the Dragon has to do. He has to succeed in every turn of the Wheel. He has to see the Light concealed within the dark. As the Creator told Rand, \\"HE IS OF ME,\\" a nice cameo from a major player we hadn't heard from since The Eye of the World. Good and evil are two sides of one coin but it's a lucky weighted coin with advantage to the good guys. Evil becomes the master only when goodness is no longer championed. Wielding the blade Callandor helps, too.<br /><br />Every Darkfriend in this series fought solitary battles at the mercy of Darkfriends crueler than they were. They could fall at a moment's notice. The Dark One never forgave and never sympathized. Every Darkfriend lived with terror always in the background of their mind because they believed mankind was ultimately wicked. They did not recognize the sheer power of goodness and therefore could not benefit from it.<br /><br />This concept of perseverance through darkness struck in powerful fashion when we saw the hundred thousand and six fighting at Tarwin's Gap. The entire Borderland converged upon the hope of taking back their land, of fighting against the ever-gaining borders of the Blight approaching from their own backyard. They witnessed an overwhelming darkness as it consumed their homeland, closer and closer every year. Finally, they came together to say that it didn't matter that they would lose. It did not matter that they would die.<br /><br />What mattered was that they fought against the evil and never gave up hope. As the Aiel said, \\"'Till shade is gone, 'till water is gone, into the Shadow with teeth bared, screaming defiance with the last breath, to spit in Sightblinder's eye on the last day.\\" We do not admit defeat to evil. We hear from all sides, \\"I WIN. AGAIN. THE FIGHT IS OVER.\\" And we answer, as Rand did, that it has not yet begun. There is light if we search for it. Our mere refusal to let darkness win saves us.<br /><br />Thank you, Robert Jordan, for giving us this testimony.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The wait was too long.. yes the ending was a bigger WHAT! In need of more drama and hoping all stops for the love ...
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I bought this for my nephew and he really loved it. it is crazy wild. he spent hours playing with it and still picks it up years later.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I don't know who I should be more upset with Sylvia Day or another author (who did a great job with hers) who started the fad of the \\"trigolgy books\\", but I can tell you that I am finished with the Crossfire series.  Very disappointed in it.  Not only was the story line lackluster,(really after so times of the characters reacting to everything the same way, it gets quite dull) you finish the trilogy ONLY to find find it isn't over yet and Day is working on another book in the lives of Eva and Gideon. REALLY!!!! To paraphase Sylia's ending note to the readers \\"This REALLY SHOULD be the end to this series.  I totally agree with the others who didn't like this book.  If you liken yourself to the mouse that runs around in the wheel over and over again or to someone who gets trapped in a revolving door, then by all means--knock yourself out and spend your money on another Crossfire book. :)
B008CPZNL6|1.0|I really like Flipboard and use it regularly on my iPhone 4S. I have been very disappointed when it stopped working on my Kindle Fire in March 2013. Why isn't the new 2.x version available? Either Flipboard doesn't know what's wrong or Amazon doesn't want it to work. #fail on both of you.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Read the book first so I could watch the movie.  Enjoyed both however there are alot of differences in the book and the movie just to let some of you know.  Overall, both were good
0756405890|4.0|The prose of this book is beautiful and unpretentious and simple. The music and poetry is lyrical and stays in my mind after the read. The story is addictive. I read a hundred pages the first day and read the rest of it (over 600 additional pages) the second.<br /><br />The character of Qvothe is fascinating in many ways; he performs, he analyzes, he learns, he lives. He is brilliant--a character trait which often fails to live up to its claims but definitely works in this case, thanks to the aptitude of the author.<br /><br />I love the singing and I love the academic slant. The characters are memorable and don't push to be seen or loved; that is why they are seen and loved (or hated in a couple cases).<br /><br />The author's sense of humor is shown numerous times throughout the books, causing me to laugh out loud more than once. Even better, he weaves in plot twists I absolutely did not anticipate and loved. That earns even more respect when I'd already decided it was an excellent book.<br /><br />All in all, most fans of epic fantasy fan will enjoy this book. I don't usually make that claim and I'm rather picky.<br /><br />My only problem is that I hate Denna, the main love interest. She's irrational and I just can't like her. I suppose that puts me in the ranks of the females in the books, because she doesn't have any female friends and usually just gets along with men. I find her thoroughly unlikable and I hate the way she treats the main character, whom I love. She doesn't deserve him. At least she knows it. I'm not an ounce sympathetic to her.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This is a very good looking charger. There are a lot of detailed reviews here on Amazon so I am not going to bother repeating. It is a great product as of this writing. It works perfectly and looks good doing it.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I like the books but I'm disappointed that the story didn't end with BOOK 3. Let's stop with the three and four books for one story it's annoying.

B00B6CQIO8|5.0|Seriously??  What is not to love about Downton Abby?  The purchase came quickly and was as described.  High drama, British accents, war, pestilence and romance.  I must retire to my fainting couch to fan myself....
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|After waiting excitedly for this conclusion to an already thin story line, I was very disappointed to read page after page of uninspired, boring sex scenes and endless \\"I love you\\", and \\"I can't live without you\\" drivel.  No plot to speak of, zero further character development, and a most unsatisfying ending- oh wait- there was no ending...Boo, Ms. Day.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Can't put the book down. Looking forward to the movie and seeing how close the book is to the movie.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Great show - ready for season six. Worth downloading to get the episodes I missed because they were pre- empted for sports events.

1451627297|5.0|This is one of Stephen King's best works.  Read it or lose out. Your choice.  His &#34;Gunslinger&#34; books are excellent in their own way, and his horror is the best, but this book is unbelievable in its scope, history, and with its love story that defies time itself it actually obliterates the mold.
B006BZ8WAI|5.0|Love the way they have experimented with Dub Step on this album. Can't wait for their next album due out soon. If your a Korn fan, it's a must. Nicely dark and haunting.

0062014536|3.0|I loved all the books in the trilogy. However, I was very dissapointed with the ending. It felt very unresolved.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Works great - go to Kindle via pc, laptop or tablet, choose your title(s), pay if required to do so, and Amazon effortlessly transfers the book, et al to the android device.  In my instance, it is a tablet.  No pain, no strain!
B002QBS9KE|5.0|The headset works great until the eartips break off...<br />Easy to replace and restores headset to new condition.<br />Better fit for my ear.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|This show was action packed and never let up; yet also never felt contrived.  Great acting and storylines, I loved it even though I don't usually like police/crime dramas.  It was a seven season ride with a satisfying conclussion....although I would love a TV movie set 3 years or so after the finnish to catch up with the characters.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|this app does exactly what it says. after taking the time to calibrate, I have precision timing regarding battery life. I had absolutely no misgivings about buying the pro version after trying the free one.
159463176X|2.0|Hosseini's first two books were excellent, so I eagerly looked forward to his latest effort only to be very disappointed.<br /><br />He jumps from several different narrators in different time frames so it is extremely difficult to follow.  It's hard to figure whether you're in present day or 50 years ago.<br /><br />It would have been so easy to do it in a normal sequence and would have made more sense.  Also, the different narrators span 3 generations which made it unnecessarily complicated trying to figure out how each character is related.<br /><br />He used several editors on his first two books.  Too bad he didn't employ one this time.  He wouldn't have made these amateur mistakes.
B009LMTDL0|2.0|After decades of hearing what to do, Sheryl shows us the proof in her accomplishments. We do hear that finding the right partner is not only helpful, but necessary for those wanting family and career.  Otherwise, her message is soldier on.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book has a lot of surprises for the reader.  It keeps you on your toes: just when you start thinking, &#34;Well, haven't they<br />found the gun yet?&#34; the gun turns up in a surprising way . . . or did it?  I was fascinated with the manipulations of the court<br />trial.  Goes way beyond the usual drivel of dialog you often find in legal thrillers.  Way beyond.  And by the time you get<br />to the end, and you say, &#34;Wow, that was a great story!&#34; you find there are more surprises to come.  Read it and enjoy it.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Really helps to see just how much time I have left on Kindle especially when you are on a road trip.
B000O14VAU|5.0|yes its derivative, yes its predictable, yes its werewolf romeo meets vampire juliette meet in the matrix, etc but i just had fun watching it.  every time i am hung over i will watch this and enjoy it.  if bill nighy is in something, you watch it, you love him and that is that.  oddly, kate beckinsale has the worst english accent of all time, and she is british...does that sum this film up completely? yes.  yes it does.
0425263924|5.0|This is the best book in the series! H-O-T!!! The story is obviously not finished. I literally couldn't put this down until I finished it. Entwined was the perfect title since Gideon & Eva were entwined throughout most of the book. Great story. Hot sex. A little mystery. I'm on the edge of my seat for the next book!
B0060MYK7G|5.0|Just as good as #1 and The Tudors.  Now we need a series that starts with Edward, Mary & goes through Elizabeth Tudor.
B00AE4OGCU|4.0|very well written especially when you think it was translated. Kept me on the edge of my seat and could not put the book down
B00942G4UA|4.0|Makes you definitely reconsider your food choices. Seemed relatively balanced in its reporting, although you end up walking away hating the big guys and wanting to support the local farmers. I liked the short, quick format that gives you the important information you need, without bogging you down in the complexity of the issues that can easily become &#34;inside baseball&#34;.
0756404738|5.0|Love the books so far my only complaint would be the long wait between books. All well, just hope Mr, Rothfuss doesn't do a &#34;Robert Jordan&#34; on us.

B00009NQQO|5.0|I was a bit nervous about the semi mixed reviews.  I can only assume that the success of the suction is dependent upon the type of shower/bath tub you have.

B00C33M2EE|5.0|These guys are sooooooo phenomenal and I listen to them a LOT! Glad to have a DVD and their music. When I'm listening to their music without benefit of the video, my mind's eye sees the video anyway. I think that's a phenomenal job with the video work and is just as important as the actual music.<br /><br />Love the cello! Love the piano! Love the video. Thanks guys for this truly wonderful-in-every-direction piece of art.<br /><br />Earleen
B008Y1YKE4|4.0|I viewed this over the weekend, twice, and enjoyed it quite a bit. It's smart and kinda British in its cultural values and style. I am an American but am accustomed to British entertainment in movies, radio plays, and TV shows; I found it easy to watch, and got all the \\"in\\" jokes, I think.<br /><br />This movie is based on a family of Santas who have the hereditary title passed down through the male line of the family. The family is obviously intended not as an ideal family, but simply as a normal family with normal family dynamics that children in the UK would be familiar with. This makes it nicely accessible for them.<br /><br />The energy of the story is very good, the characterizations strong and funny, and the ideas engaging. Visuals outstanding. I embrace this movie's contribution to the Christmas movie canon.<br /><br />What didn't I like? All the elder Santas were very self-centered, and that was a little jarring (too much like ordinary people, sadly), and there was no concern for the fate of the reindeer team. Even in an animated film, I find carelessness toward animals disturbing. That I would change, for a fact, were I re-making this movie! It doesn't have to be saccharine, just some kind of reasonable sop to the conscience; children and adults both need that, I think.<br /><br />It still succeeds, though, even with the perceived flaws. In the end, the self-centered older men get a waking-up for themselves, get it together as a family, and resolve their crisis in a way that embraces them as adult men with a sense of justice. I find it a strong creative effort and worth your time. If you are worried about it, watch it before your kids do, and make up your own mind. Frankly, I think it is a future classic. Let's call it a modern take on things!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great show---entertaining with romance, intrigue and almost always a cliff-hanger at the end.  Can't wait until Season 4 begins!  Love it!
B004T2QZL8|1.0|it stinks because if u uninstall it and try to install it again all your data is erased. I HATE IT NOW!!!

B009KS4XRO|4.0|This is a great game and fun to play.  It tends to freeze up if you enter a room with over 100 or more players, though.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|This film was \\"dark.\\"  And I mean literally.  So much action took place at dark that it was often difficult to even see the film, much less what was going on.  The plot was very predictable.  Love Tommy Lee Jones, though!
B00AH34AUQ|3.0|These 3 releases are all pretty good albums(shows my age....) but they could have been skillfully whittled down into something that could have been mind blowing and fantastic follow up's to the 2 previous blockbusters.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia day's lead characters have been dealt a bad hand, they had a very difficult set of events in their life, book one gave us some inside to their story, but also a light in their tormented life came to shine, the light that only true love, and a strong desire for one another and the most beautiful tormented love affair starts to develop, book 2 dealt with problems and solutions still the love affair raw, and needed, Sylvia day delivered 100% , and again in book 3 first two chapters, have me on me knees, heart pounding and silently crying as I read the long awaited installment, again emotions stronger, and the story line continues to develop introducing us to a deeper side of the life of the characters involve and around Eva Trammel and Gideon Cross, writer manage to keep us at the edge of emotions,  love making  and transportation were in check, and with a sassy side, so well known as Sylvia Day's style of writing, I did enjoyed every chapter to the max, from the touching way she developed chapter one and two, to the last emotional chapters of book three, Sylvia Day didn't came short, she delivered a strong mature reader book, enchanted, romantic and sassy with a very strong touch of Kinkiness, yes, I love her style of writing and this is a must read book!.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|At the first listen I wasn't all too sure I loved it....but it grows on you in a serious way. They've (or he) really evolved with this release and its a refreshing change.<br />Though I wish it wasn't this number of years between releases.....
0756405890|5.0|Let me start this review off by saying that I am wary of high fantasy novels. And by wary, I mean that I usually run for the hills whenever anyone recommends a high fantasy series to me. There are a few reasons for this:<br /><br />1. Many high fantasy authors try to reach the height and depth of Tolkien's gorgeous prose, story, and characters. And they crash and burn. Because they are not J.R.R Tolkien.<br /><br />2.For some reason, authors think that writing high fantasy gives them the license to take one hundred pages to clear their throats. It seems like most high fantasy novels are at least 700 pages long, and there are always around fifteen books in the series...cough...Robert Jordan...<br /><br />3. Almost all high fantasy follows the same storyline. The exact same one.*<br /><br />*Except in George R.R. Martin's books where everyone just... Dies.<br /><br />Now, as far as complaint number three goes, there is a reason that so many high fantasy novels are exactly the same, with a few shades of nuance here or there. Willa Cather once wrote, \\"There are only two or three human stories, and they go on repeating themselves as fiercely as if they had never happened before.\\" One of these stories is the story of the archetypal Hero. Joseph Campbell wrote about the archetypal Hero in his renowned book The Hero with a Thousand Faces. Campbell explored many of the texts that have survived throughout the centuries--the stories of heroes like Gilgamesh, Odysseus, and Beowulf--and found that the important myths of different cultures around the world have many unifying aspects and share a similar structure. Campbell called this \\"monomyth,\\" and summed up the story of the Hero, writing:<br /><br />\\"A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man.\\"<br /><br />So very many high fantasy stories follow this model. And I'm not saying that is a bad thing, as I find it fascinating that so many stories from different cultures and parts of the world follow this structure. It's just not something I'm necessarily willing to read all of the time. Then I recently read Patrick Rothfuss' The Name of the Wind, a book that takes the story of the Hero and turns it on its head.<br /><br />The Name of the Wind is a story within a story. In a tavern over the span of three days and nights, a Hero agrees to recount his life story to a scribe. This hero, named Kvothe, is an adventurer, musician, arcanist (something akin to a sorcerer), and a killer of kings. \\"I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings,\\" He says. \\" I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs to make the minstrels weep. You may have heard of me.\\" Kvothe grew up in a traveling troupe of performers, and after his family is brutally murdered by supernatural beings, he decides to attend the land's University, in order to learn a type of magic so that he can avenge his family.<br /><br />This plot sounds incredibly similar, does it not? Kvothe ventures forth on a journey to defeat the supernatural, make a name for himself, and win the girl. And yet, with the way that Rothfuss structures his book, the reader knows that Kvothe will go on to do great things, but his journey to those great things is filled with many tongue-in-cheek twists on Campbell's monomyth. My favorite example of this is when Kvothe seeks out a wise, mentor figure (see: Obi Wan Kenobi, Merlin, Dumbledore, etc.) whom he knows can teach him a powerful form of magic. Kvothe is so desperate to become this man's pupil that he pulls an incredibly dangerous stunt, in order to prove how far he will go to learn from this man. Instead of being impressed and taking him on as a student, the man says that Kvothe is much too unstable and reckless to learn his type of magic and leaves. In this way, Rothfuss subverts reader expectations throughout much of the book.<br /><br />Kvothe is aware of the myths in his own world, and subverts many of them while telling his own story. He says at one point, \\"I am a myth... A very special kind of myth that creates itself. The best lies about me are the ones I told.\\" Because of this, The Name of the Wind is a breath of fresh air in high fantasy, as it plays with the very ideas and structure that comprise the genre itself. Rothfuss is a very talented writer, with a wry sense of humor and a flair for storytelling. So thank you, Patrick Rothfuss, for breaking through my high fantasy cynicism. I'm off to request the sequel, The Wise Man's Fear, at my library now.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|It just doesn't work at all. When I go into the app it just glitches and then ends up automatically closing. Since the month that I've had it, I haven't watched a single video.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Very detailed, and very helpful for my vocabulary. Thank you for bringing this helpful app. This has help me a lot.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Great graphics, life like fish. You just want to play all the time. Great family game. Told my whole family about it.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|(Quote)From the moment I first saw him--saw through his stunning and impossibly gorgeous exterior to the dark and dangerous man inside--I'd felt the pull that came from finding the other half of myself. I needed him like I needed my heart to beat, and he's put himself in great jeopardy, risked everything--for me.<br /><br />I fell right back into Gideon and Eva's world and their relationship. They are now dealing with the ramifications of what Gideon did to protect her in Reflected in You. They are trying to pull the pieces together but still have to keep it a a secret to avoid any further complications. Their passion, their need, their witty rapport, and their love shine through in each encounter. They both still have situations and people from their past encroaching on their thoughts and lives.<br /><br />Eva is still independent and determined to stay that way. But her devotion and love for Gideon is obvious. She seems stronger now and more secure. She is trying to push past her demons that left her broken and move on. And she understands that Gideon is working to make progress too. But she is still hesitant to jump too far too fast.<br /><br />(Quote)I was the one person who knew every dark, tormented secret he had, and I loved him desperately anyway. And he needed love more than anyone I'd ever met.<br /><br />Gideon is still protective, controlling, devoted and sexy as h**l. His intense need for Eva is not in question. He wants to possess her, protect her, and keep her close. Gideon still can give me goosebumps. He is so dominant and alpha, yet also vulnerable, tender, and broken. I love how devoted he is to Eva and how he does everything he can to make her happy and safe. It is like his whole existence now depends on her and it is incredibly hypnotic and intense. He still has an edge of mystery and all of his secrets have yet to be revealed.<br /><br />\\"I look at you, angel, and I want you so badly. I want to be with you, listen to you, talk to you. I want tohear you laugh and hold you when you cry. I want to sit next to you, breathe the same air, share the same life. I want to wake up to you like this every day forever. I want you.\\"<br /><br />\\"You own me Eva. Wherever I am, whatever I'm doing, I belong to you.\\"<br /><br />There are still mysteries and secrets coming to light and nightmares to face. Typically, they are faced with challenges that they have to overcome. Their communication is improving, yet they still have differences in opinion on how to proceed with their future. But we are seeing them work more together instead of second guessing each other. So we have seen a lot of growth with these characters throughout the series.<br /><br />(Quote)If souls could be mated with wishes, our would be inextricably entwined.<br /><br />Most of the supporting characters were back and had their own stories and dramas unfolding: the Cary, Trey and Tatiana triangle; Mark and Steven, Megumi, her parents, his family, Corinne, and Magdalene. And her ex Brett the rock star added more complications.<br /><br />As much as I adore these characters and their relationship, I still am a little torn. Part of me is glad there will be two more books, but the other part of me was ready for their story to be complete with a big HEA ending in this trilogy. Even though I enjoy them together and liked being back in their world, this story was a little slower paced than the previous two books. But there was still some drama, secrets, definitely some sweet moments, and lots of sex. Sometimes it seemed like the hot sexy moments overshadowed the story a bit, but they were intense, passionate, and adventurous. I enjoyed the progression of Gideon and Eva's relationship and seeing the softer side of Gideon. I did like this installment of the series, but maybe not quite as much as the first two. But I did enjoy it. I love Gideon and Eva...and Cary. I was really happy with some of the events that happened. A few things, especially some of the secrecy and hiding kind of got on my nerves. There were a few times it seemed to get caught up in other secondary story lines. And there were a couple of things that seemed a bit out of place in this book, but are probably building up to be more important in the next book. The ending seemed a little abrupt and I guess I was not quite ready for it to end. But it did leave it open to add some drama to the beginning of the next book. And I was thankful it was not a big fat ugly cliffhanger. I am looking forward to book four. There are still some unanswered questions and obviously more drama left to unfold. I do really enjoy these characters and Sylvia Day's writing style. She draws me into their world and I am totally invested in this couple.<br /><br />Thanks to Sylvia Day and Sullivan and Partners for providing me with a copy in exchange for an honest review.
B003G4W49C|5.0|One of the most unique and disturbing reads I have read in a long time. With a plot twist I should have expected... but didn't. I never saw it coming. And I see most coming from a mile away. Mixed with some interesting scientific, psychological and social concepts. Not your typical read. Moving to Speaker for the Dead next.
B00CHNKJFO|4.0|My only complaint  is how some tables are amazingly  easy to rack up millions and some tables  are virtually impossible to get something going on. Otherwise a perfect  game.
0425263924|4.0|I really enjoyed the fist 2 novels and had been waiting for months for ths one to come out. I have to say I was a little disappointed with this one. Just a little too much lovin in this one and I think there could have been a little more story, instead, it is going to be drug out into a 4th book, and who knows how long before that one comes out. I was really hoping the story would have been completed. I wouldn't mind reading another one of course, because I love the story, I just really hate waiting so long for the next one to come out. Either way, I will be waiting to hear when the next book in completed so I can order it immediately. I found this series much better than the 50 shades books.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|This book once again kept me interested. A lot of people are complaining about the cliffhanger ending and yes it was a cliffhanger, but that just means this isn't the end of Eva and Gideon, we get at least 2 more books of them!!!! I read a statement from Sylvia on Facebook which she says it is not about the money that she is making more books. Even if she was, we get to read more about Eva and Gideon!!! I don't see why everyone is so mad about this. And people are mad about the price of the books..yes they are more than the average book but so was fifty shades! It happens... It is a good enough book that I guess I'll pay the price for the book. Just hope the next 2 books come out quick because I want to see what happens in the life of Eva.
B0002X314C|3.0|This CD did not grab me like some of his songs had in the past.  I need to really take more time to listen to the entire CD.
B008TMA1LY|1.0|I was frustrated by how impossible it is to play the game without paying for it. I definitely understand giving incentives to users to pay- that's how the game makers make their money, and if I feel like I'm getting a good enough service I'm happy to pay for some things. But calling this a &#34;FREE&#34; app and then making it so difficult to play without paying money bothers me.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Still working on it, but it's a pretty solid read so far, with plenty of good solid facts and narrative.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I used to play this several times a day until the update. now it seems like a pioneer gets sick constantly and I cant keep up with it despite making medicinal items constantly. basically changed everything I liked about this game its very frustrating I'm a level 56 and I'm seriously considering uninstalling.
B0063M22QO|5.0|It had lots of tile set ups to keep it interesting. They highlight the open tiles to make it easier to find them.
B00000FC5H|5.0|I really enjoy this CD!  These songs are from the 80's when they were hot!  I like EW&F!  Old time classic R&B music
B00CW665VI|5.0|What a fun,enjoyable read,with great characters. I couldn't put it down,smiled and laughed out loud.  I will recommend it to my friends.
1781162646|4.0|Once again, one of my favorite authors has felt the need to convey his political views in his latest novel \\"Joyland\\". I loved the book and read it in a couple of days but I could care less about Mr. Kings political views. Please don't make this a habit.
B001N1DPDE|4.0|Great Knife. Sheath has some issues as stated in the other reviews.  I took it out for a 3 day backpacking trip and didn't notice the weight on my belt.  The snap retention that is rivited into the nylon loop pulled through on the second day.  I have a tek lok on order that should resolve any issues.  The main portion of the sheath is good.  The knife itself is excellent.  It took a beating and maintained a good edge.  The knife showed up with a very sharp edge.  If it wasn't for the sheath this would be a 5 star knife.
1449410243|5.0|I am a cat owner and they amuse me constantly.  When I got this book for my birthday, I couldn't put it down!  The humor is dry, imaginative, and to the point and the illustrations are great.  I bought three the day after receiving mine and gave them as gifts.  All loved the book.
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|This CD was not as good as the previous one to me.  I expected more from this CD and kind of disappointed
B005S9EKCW|4.0|I didn't watch this movie, but I saw on commercial and<br />Golden Globe Awards + Academy Awards Shows moments<br />of their best work.<br /><br />I thought it was the first musical movie that wasn't<br />boring/obvious.There were some obvious moments,<br />but that clear out of the way when the actors try to<br />portray some individual scenes. I like how it's organized<br />correlate with this girl's story.<br /><br />I gave this as a gift.<br /><br />T. M.
076115678X|5.0|I loved the first book, and this one is great, too, since available hair products have changed since the first book came out.  I also liked the fact that more types of curly hair are described - especially since my hair is one of the new types described, and full instructions for cleansing, styling, etc. are included.  Anyone with curly hair can benefit greatly from this book!
B0010Z32OA|5.0|wonderful movie. while Claire Daines may not be a typical Hollywood beauty she most assuredly has a smile for the ages.
B00BESNKB8|2.0|You would think that with such stars As Russell Crow, Lucy Lui, and others this would have been a much better movie.<br />Well it's Not! I did not like this movie at all. I don't mind stupid plots, but a movie has to give me something; Characters I care about, good special effects, good music, good acting. I got nothing from this movie. Again, I did not like this movie
B001ANSSDC|5.0|So many people suffer with mental illness and this book inspires hope for those that are afflicted. Love and acceptance are great healers! Quick does an awesome job introducing realistic, quirky characters who seamlessly drive the story of redemption, loss, faith and acceptance...
0545091020|5.0|I listen to these books.  The reader was very good.  The story<br />was great.  It reminded me of the great depression my Mother<br />and Dad used to talk about.  It brought up emotions,about our<br />government, and the control they seek.  The idea some people<br />have everything, some barely survive, Some don't survive. Its all<br />in the experience of the reader. Good Book!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Sylvia, Sylvia, Sylvia. Not only was this book so disappointing, I will probably never read a book by her again. This book so so crammed full of people and situations, you just didn't give a damn about, that I could not wait till the end.  And what a disappointing end!  Why did she even put Megumi in this book?  This book did not have twists and turns, it had ramblings of someone trying to finish her homework! She has milked her readers with this book and has definitely taken us all to the bank! First book ever have I wanted my money back!  Ever!
B00992CF6W|4.0|Okay so I love minecraft and stuff but we have been waiting for the update for three days after I phone got it. if it takes this long to get a update I am going to just buy a I pad because it will update. if I have to I will downlode the update on my kindle because its so stupit how long we have been in alfa. Monjang and Amazon need to get it together and get that update. Wye should get it when iphone and them get it. its not fair for us. that's why u don't get 5 stars
B00992CF6W|5.0|i love this game but i saw the new update and it would be nice if u hade it for kindle fire
B00992CF6W|4.0|Look I know you want an update well it's coming.it's already updated on ios and android so yeah.it has buckets servers cake eggs and...in game options!
0525478817|4.0|It was a really good book ; it took a bit to get into it, but once I did I read it quickly.
0375842209|5.0|This book was recommended to me by my niece who is a freshman in college majoring in English. I am an avid reader and a middle school English teacher and had somehow never heard of it. From the first page, I was confused and considered not continuing to read. I pushed on and the book became more and more interesting and intriguing. I recommend it to anyone just for the unusualness (real word?) alone.
B008YCMM2A|2.0|Yes, I read where Miles stated this group was hot, and too bad they never got to the studio, as they were a road band.<br /><br />Then we have this Sony issue,  this Bootleg series , volume 2. This record is just terrible, and in my opinion Miles would have never let it go out the public as an indication or documentation of this band, if indeed he felt this band was so hot.  The recording that the europeans made on these evenings were terrible, so terrible that apparently Miles never heard them, and apparently didn't know he was being recorded.It is nowhere near as good as booklet vol. 1.<br />I purchased the album because I am a Miles fan, and have about 90% of all of his recordings. I read a review of the bootleg, vol 2 in an English peridical called Jazz _____,  and the magizine had a whole article on this recording, made sometime after &#34;In Silent Way &#34; , and rated this a must have, 5 star product.  Nothing could be further from the truth. I am even suprised that Chick, Jack  and Dave Holland allowed this poor recording to get out to the public. I guess all is fair when record producers try to made some additional money, and oput out a poor product, when the quality inspector, Miles Davis, is dead.
B00CWX1HPA|2.0|I was about to order this Blu-ray version of the Battlestar Galactica pilot when I noticed in the Product Description that it is in French. Like most U.S. Amazon customers, I do not speak French. This disk has English subtitles, but I can't read subtitles and watch the picture at the same time. Many European movies have multiple language sound tracks, but the Product Description for this one indicates only French.<br /><br />All the reviews presented here are for the 2003 DVD release, and are fine for that movie. I own it, and am very happy with it. But unless you understand French, or have no problem with subtitles, you probably won't be happy with this one. Amazon should have taken greater pains to ensure that customers know about the French only sound track before deciding to purchase this movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It`s cool but I can't join other kindles but I can join iPhones and ipod touches I give it 5 stars so they would change it
B009JZTP4Y|3.0|I'm a Star Trek fan. I've recently been rewatching the entire original series from start to finish. When Netflix wasn't working the other night, I decided to watch the first movie, which I'd never seen. Aside from solid performances from pretty much everyone, the only reason it wasn't disappointing is that I'd heard it was disappointing. The pacing was terrible, the plot was about 2 degrees removed from a Season 2 episode (&#34;The Changeling&#34;), and the costumes were actually so goofy that it was literally distracting.<br /><br />It only gets the 3-star rating because it was the first attempt at making a Star Trek film and it led to Wrath of Kahn.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is amazing and it updates on its own I had it in 0.6.1 and today it turned into 0.7.1 alpha it's awesome
B009EAO38C|4.0|Great fun to sit and listen.  All covers, love the cello pieces, still has a pop-ish feel.<br />Three more words.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is NOT about \\"my opinion is right; their opinion is wrong\\".  I sympathize w/ the 1-star reviews.  I do.  I easily could have been one of them.  However, the low reviews are clearly due to one thing: Not pushing through Part 2.  The 5-star reviews (obviously) are from people who pushed through part 2.  Consider that... 1-star: stopped in part 2.  5-star: read the entire omnibus.  If a review says \\"it's all about people walking up/down some stairs.\\", that is part 2.  Here's the breakdown.<br /><br />Part 1: A genius short story, which easily stands alone.  If you like part 1, you should buy the Omnibus; it IS worth it.<br /><br />Part 2: A lot of stairs, a lot of questions, a lot of seemingly illogical plot devices.  A lot of pages.  A lot of character development.  It's not the most interesting read, but without it, parts 3-5 would not have the impact they ultimately do.<br /><br />Part 3: Drops the workhorse that was part 2 for a more intriguing plot.  It reminds you of what grabbed you in part 1, and the pages turn more easily.<br /><br />Part 4: The answers start to come.  The seeming inconsistencies of part 2 are revealed to in fact be creative plot devices.  You suddenly begin to recognize, that this is not the \\"interesting concept\\" short story of part 1, nor the \\"hum-drum sci fi\\" you thought you had in part 2, nor the \\"curious\\" book you thought you had in part 3... this is a classic.  THIS is where the 5-star reviews begin to make sense.<br /><br />Part 5: This is where you lose nights.  Downright maddening.  You'll go to work tired until you finish part 5, and the night you DO finish part 5, you'll be exactly where I am right now: anticipating one last tired work day, as I write a 5-star review, because I can't bloody sleep until I tell everyone to read this damned book.  Emails, Facebook posts, all that.  I've told family, friends, and people at work about this book.  I can't tell you how grateful I was to read that ending.  Howey, thank you for not blowing it.  Rock solid.<br /><br />If you like part 1 (which really is brilliant), you WILL love this book... provided you don't let the pace in part 2 get you down.  Do it.  You'll thank me.<br /><br />You're welcome.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Pretty cool game. I did not expect to enjoy it. Much more than a hidden object  game.  I can't wait to play the sequel.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|I am so sad that this is the last season!! I don't know what I will watch next! By far this is the best of show!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I as well as many others waited and waited for this book. I thought &#34;Ok, the wait will be worth it&#34; when the release date for this book was pushed back again. I hate the way it ended. I didn't like some occurrences in the story. I feel like this is by far the worst of Sylvia Day's books that I have read. I am not disappointed by the fact that she has decided to make this series a quintet but with this book she could have done a whole lot better. I am not sure that I will bother with reading the rest of the series when ever it is published.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I love this game. It has a kids safe mode so everyone can be a God! A total must-have. You should get it.
B003QSMCKO|5.0|My daughter still loves this move. It's very inspirational and one of our favorite &#34;Disney Princess&#34; movies! I think my daughter has seen this move 20 times.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like the game very much if your reading this and you don't have the game yet your going to like it even my dad likes it it kicks other games butt but not minecraft
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love !!!!!!!! This game. the new update 0.7.3 is amaizing you now have the moon andd the sunYou can play creative or survival. In creative there are no living things and your items are never-ending . In survival you can fight epic monsters kill helpless animals or even strike gold in a mineshaft. Mojang should add minecarts and boats wolves and endermen. I hope this was  helpful. ;-)
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Very entertaining.  Keeps you engaged watching the tree being restored.  I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes match 3 games
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|Cute. A good time waster.  Makes you think and use logic. Kids seem to love it too<br /><br />Wish there were more games like it
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this app is really fun and addicting. I play it every day but I really wish they gave you more coins. you don't have to buy them with real money but you must wait for them instead. its still really fun though. download this app!!!!!
B007VDN1PA|5.0|I bought this item on March 29, 2013 from DBROTH via Amazon. I selected Saturday shipping and received it the next day.  This scanner is very easy to use, right out of the box.  No PC is ever needed, as long as you have somewhere to view the scans (like a TV with a card reader, a tablet, etc.) However, if you are like me, and you have lots of slides to scan, you'll want to dump them onto a hard drive and/or somewhere in the \\"Cloud\\" for safe keeping. (P.S. Don't trust a hard drive or memory card. It may fail, or if it is damaged, stolen or lost in a fire, you'll lose your photos. Get them on the cloud via a backup service or other online storage quickly, so you'll never ever lose them!)<br /><br />Since I received it, I have scanned over 2500 slides.  They take only a few seconds for each one.  Maybe 10 seconds from the time you start putting the slide in, until you remove it.  I was not looking for perfection with the scans, and I don't think this device can give you that.  The only \\"problem\\" I had with this is that the exposure can be too bright or too dark sometimes.  You can control it in the settings, however.  But with 2500+ slides to scan, I did not want to take the time to adjust the exposure for each one.  Ultimately, I was looking to relive the memories on these images, not to view them as if I was there.<br /><br />Once I dumped them onto my PC, I brought them into Picasa and touched up many of them.  It did a pretty good job of compensating for the weakness of the scanner. But again, I was not looking for perfection for 2500+ slide. I just wanted to get them digitized as quickly as possible.  Speaking of Picasa - a little trick you can do is add Tags to each image. So you can add a tag of the name of each person in the photo (or a location, object, etc). Once complete, you can then do a search for any photos with the tag for a certain person and see all photos they are in at once.  It saves the tags as part of the image file's properties, so you can evendo a search in Windows Explorer using the tags.  (ie, type in the search box: \\"tag:adam\\".)<br /><br />The screen is no bigger than the slides, so it isn't much better than holding it up to a light to see what it is.<br /><br />I also had an issue with some of the slides getting wedged into the slot.  Apparently some slides are a bit larger than others and I had to push them down hard to get them to go into the slot all the way.  Then, because of them being recessed into the unit, they were hard to get back out with my fingers.  I found that keeping needle-nose pliers with me during my scanning made it much easier to remove the stuck slides. I had to use it a lot.  You may not experience this, but just thought I'd share the tip about the pliers in case you do.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this scanner to anyone looking to get their slides digitized as quickly as possible, and not too worried about having the highest quality scans.<br /><br />I did not use the negative scan feature, so I can not comment on that.  But for my purposes, this little guy was well worth the money!
B0016JBCJW|2.0|When, and if, you watch this movie, play close attention to Jason Schwartman's character. What is he doing? You could ask this question in every scene. His poses, his expressions, his mannerisms seem to be just to make sure you know this is a Wes Anderson film. At the end, you will ask, why is he in the movie? What was the point of his character? The credits may give a clue, since he was one of the principle writers. Why not add himself to the cast and get two paychecks?<br /><br />This is dumb, meandering mess of a film. The sex scene in the beginning is harsh and unnecessary. Brodie is good and brings some dimension to his character, Anjelica Huston is great as always but on the whole, thumbs down.
0812550757|5.0|I highly recommend this book. I devoured this book. It's captivated, relate-able and very touching. This was the first sci fi book I read and now I'm hooked.

B00969PR18|4.0|This app is great, works much better than Mapquest on my Kindle Fire HD. I downloaded the US package (cost 299 coins) and installed the state's I needed. It takes a while to download but the offline maps are great. Finally can plan our trip hassle free.

B009NX61JY|5.0|A sweet movie with a gentle message. Bridges and Strassand make a believable couple. Sweet, if predictable, ending. Another of Barbara's 'ugly duckling' to swan movies.
B0063GORYU|2.0|I used to play this all the time but no longer.  Tooooooo many ads and I don't like the fact that I have to be signed into Amazon to play this on my Android

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|cannot put the kindle down. Will there be another????? What will become of those two? Passing the word to all
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|This movie is not just a movie. It challenges your thoughts and entertains your emotions at the same time. It is smart, magical, and satisfies that itch for something different to invest your time into watching. Very fulfilling and well told, without the sappy romantic rubbish in most movies. It is clear, doesnt jump around a lot, and is extraordinarily action-packed. I loved the mystery in it- it was perfect, not confusing. Makes you want to be a part of every world that this movie depicts. A masterpiece it is.
B006ID6NDQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Especially that it is a true story and you learn so much about how things were for those who went through this horrible time in history.

0385349947|5.0|We're educated, we're ambitious, and we're dropouts.<br /><br />  Lean In is peppered with solid references, some so interesting I actually read the footnotes in detail and looked up some of the sources. She comments: \\"The pipeline that supplies the educated workforce is chock-full of women at the entry level, but by the time that same pipeline is filling leadership positions, it is overwhelmingly stocked with men.\\"  Ms. Sandberg could have made her book bleak, but that wasn't her intent. Rather, she's seeking to motivate women at all career levels to aim for their best. She says: \\"This book makes the case for leaning in, for being ambitious in any pursuit...I do not believe that there is one definition of success and happiness.\\"  Great point, I thought, and one that set me to thinking about the concept of lean in. What does that mean?<br /><br />  I am a corporate dropout having left employment on November 10, 2004. I started my own business in the fall of 2003. I aimed to grow the company quickly, to leave my job, and I did. Nine years later I've sold that original company, founded two new ones, expanded and added new divisions to my businesses. I've been offered various jobs over the years, including one that I in turn offered to my husband; he was a much better fit, anyway. Bottom line, I've never looked back. The entrepreneurial world is my place.<br /><br />  Upon leaving the brokerage firm I worked for in 2004, the HR people never called to do an exit interview. My boss, a man that only appreciated females with loose morals or with 36 X 24 X 36 measurements, certainly didn't question it-he'd never expected me to excel anyway and probably, should he recall me today, wouldn't believe I'd yet done much. Oddly, someone did notice, though. Two days after I left, I received a call from the corporate headquarters. Assuming it was about benefits, I returned it and was surprised to hear the young marketing team lead on the other line. I'd met him a few times during my training, but honestly I didn't assume he'd remember me. Thinking back, I should have-I stuck out obviously among my training class of 30 given I was both the only women and the tallest. He'd only just heard that I had left and called to learn why. He sounded genuinely concerned. Was it my work environment, he queried, his voice creaking with the fear.  Perhaps he worried I'd file suit against the aforementioned Neanderthal boss known company-wide as a pervert. No, I said, scowling. What had they overlooked, he asked. Nothing that I could think of, I assured. He then offered me a job at Corporate in marketing. I didn't want to move out of state; he offered to let me do some sort of a territory option; but I just wanted to go, I said. Puzzled, he seemed genuinely alarmed that I just wouldn't consider other options within the firm. Finally asked:<br /><br />\\"How have we failed to support you?\\"<br /><br />  At the time, I just wanted to be done. Before quitting, I'd spent a year of mornings crying daily as I drove to that job. Fact was, I hated it. I was bored, too. I was ready to tackle something on my own. But reading Ms. Sandberg's book brought back the memory of the marketing guy's very pointed question: \\"How have we failed to support you?\\" Recalling the young woman of 10 years ago, I wondered about the course and direction of my life. If I had not always possessed the entrepreneurial urge, and I believe some people do and some people do not, what would have happened to my career? Why on earth would I have stayed with that firm? Had I missed something being young and perhaps impetuous?<br /><br />  Even looking back with the benefit of 10 years behind me, I still struggle to find any advantages in staying there. What if I had chosen to have a baby during those years? Once my maternity leave was over, why would I have bothered to go back? Honestly, the job had been a sad creativity suck and a constant battle. I recall spending inordinate amounts of time avoiding the break room as the Branch Manager/boss often lurked there (he apparently drank a lot of coffee because he milled around in there a lot...) or cringing at the expectation that I suffer through yet another beer drinking event-aka vendor-sponsored golf outing. These occurred at least weekly during spring, summer and fall. Worse than spending the afternoon receiving unsolicited advice from drunken golf experts, were the weekly confrontations with the Office Manager (read: Head Honcho of the secretarial staff aka all women besides me). This woman believed it her duty to strictly enforce make certain that I followed the corporate women's dress code. She found me particularly lacking in the leg-covering department. Admittedly, I bucked the \\"Pantyhose Policy\\" often. I could not stand that requirement. Ladies, we are not talking about options for cute tights, or even patterns, we are talking only nude, tan, or beige hose, including for trouser socks, every single day. Yes, the manual/Bible even listed the approved shades.  Her reasoning: I was to set a good example for the other women of the office, all of them a generation older and evidently teetering on the precipice on non-compliance should I lead the flock all astray with my defiance!<br /><br />At 27 I interpreted the message as:<br /><br />\\"Good girls play nice, tolerate much, and wear panty hose.\\" At 37, I still do.<br /><br />  So, there I was, the island in the middle of the brokerage sea. I had always felt like that; like a little island hoping not to sink when the big waves came. I had to fight all the time. I longed to do more! I knew I was more! I was young, female, and ambitious. Sandberg comments in her book: \\"Professional ambition is expected of men but is optional- or worse-sometimes even a negative-for women.\\" I lived that culture once. I was not administrative staff like all the women and not a man like all the other brokers. So, thinking back to the gentleman's question, did I get the support I needed to stay, much less grow or excel-well, hell no.<br /><br />Here's the kicker; that lack of support, or whatever you want to call it, was equally lax from both genders, too. Ouch.<br /><br />Today, I'm in the throws of finishing my third book, a book about how to strategically evaluate grant funding aimed at entrepreneurs. My manuscript is due to Wiley by May 31st. It's early as I write this, I couldn't sleep well, and so I'm up. Maybe I'm cranky and tired. Maybe I'm seeking a diversion from the writing I should be doing. Or, maybe it turns out I have quite a bit to say on this topic.<br /><br />  Ladies, if haven't, didn't, or currently aren't feeling the support you need to grow in your career, I cannot say I am shocked. As you know, I never did. However, if you are not getting what you need right now, at what cost are you staying in the status quo? Like me, will you drop out? Or, will you suffer drudgery with a job you hate for the sake of working? Will stifle your uniqueness and your gifts to stay in a so-so job where you'll never rise about a certain level because \\"it just won't happen here\\" or that's \\"just not the culture\\".  I hear you; I've been the only girl in the Ye Olde Boy's Club, too.<br /><br />Ms. Sandberg raises some important questions and she has certainly set me to thinking.  I cannot total the number of conversations I've had with women my age that have dropped out of the professional world remarking: \\"You know, if that's all I'm going to get out of working there, then I might as well stay home with the kids.\\" And, so they do.  Of course, some women desire to be full time parents, so it's great they have the choice. I suspect others do want to achieve professionally while co-raising children with their spouse, but the business world just wasn't rewarding. Without quality opportunities to contribute and be challenged, staying home made sense. A career just wasn't worth it, if that `was all there is'.  Still, something is missing. I feel it.<br /><br/>Here's where things get interesting. I receive a call a week from women seeking part time work. I know many of these women; they are friends, colleagues, clients, friends of friends. I even get queries from women around the country that I'm connected to simply by social media. Linked In appears to be quite the habitat for would-be freelancers. These callers ask if I have any work, saying: \\"Just something part time, you know, maybe just 10 hours a week?\\" Sheryl Sandberg's term is Lean In. I'll borrow from my callers and use Dialed In. \\"I'd don't want to have to work too much, but just like even to stay dialed in, \\" is the refrain.<br /><br />Uh-oh. That's a problem for me. Now, I am looking at this person not woman to woman but as business owner to potential contractor. You see, that comment sounds very, very wishy-washy. It says to the potential client or employer: \\"I want you to give me something because I have a need I want to fill and I'll fill it with your job, but I'll do it at my leisure, not at your deadline, because, really, I just want something for me but I don't care what you are trying to accomplish.\\"  Some of you might be offended about what I just said, but I say it from experience; I have contracted women who start off with this phrase and it has not worked well. The level of commitment is not there to merit the desired compensation. Sorry, but it's a fact. This `dialed in' phrase sounds to a client/employer as if you don't want to be committed, responsible, or dedicated. It's like sticking a toe in the water, but telling everyone you went swimming. You'd didn't, you just got one foot wet.<br /><br />When I hire a contractor, I do not necessarily need 40 or 60 hours a week, or even a month. However, for whatever amount of time I hire, I do need 100 percent. I hire talent and expertise because I am either swamped or I simply don't possess the skill and you do. When I hire a gift I don't have, I need it and I'm counting on the person to show off that skill and get the work done well.<br /><br />Some readers may now deem me harsh. But, the need is not about me; it's about my client's needs and their goals. Still, some of you will say that no, you don't want to commit, thank you. But I ask you, why? Your time is precious, why use it on something `just 10 hours a week' if you don't care?<br /><br />  Ladies, be present, even if it's part time. Be all in, not just occasionally dialed in. If you're interested enough to try something, why not do it well? I'm not suggesting that you replace your family life, work full time, or start your own company. But all in does mean letting you shine. Make this part of your life matter, too.<br /><br />Know what you want. Know what you're good at and where you could get better. If you're in the corporate world, ask for what you need, don't wait for it to be offered. As they say, `it ain't happenin', at least not in my experience. If you're interested in politics, by all means, gather a talented team and run-now! If you are a stay at home mom that wants to freelance, decide on your services, be up front about your available time and commit with the level of seriousness of the business owner. Why? Because you do own something serious; no matter where you are in your career, you always own brand YOU. Keep it polished.<br /><br />Finally, I liked Ms. Sandberg's book. It reminded me that I need a checkup in my own commitment level. I'm evaluating what I want professionally and where to best focus my talents. I'm thinking of developing a couple of skills that need a brush up and trying out those that have potential but are untested. I'm asking myself what I asked of you: Where do I need to lean in and stop dialing in? There are clearly areas of my life where I need to fully engage or move on. I recognize when I'm not offering myself fully and abundantly, and it shows to others, too. I encourage you to read the book and consider your own personal and professional lives. Ladies, we've got this! We have to ask and aim for what matters. Don't accept so-so when you want awesome!/>Here's where things get interesting.

B00AKEMHCA|4.0|This game is a really fun app, it contains the old, and the new towers so you get to have fun and expirement with new towers, while enjoying the old ones,following with new tracks, new features like the store, the agent house, and a new trophy room, where you can see your accomplishments. the only thing that makes it four stars, is a personal opinion. But I think it gets boring after a few weeks. Then its fun to play it ever so often when your bord or when your not in internet connecting areas.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I like the part where they are transport from the Space ship to another planet and back. the Space ship Enterprise was so futureric. The plot of the movie was always good. The whole series also remind me of the good old days.
B0089AD8IO|3.0|These weren't as good as I thot they would be...maybe as the<br />series went longer they got better but were a little hokey for me.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I play lots of apps, some better than other, some are real garbage and some are good time wasters. Since I downloaded this game I have consistently played it. Over and over again. It is fun, the controls are spot on (and intuitive), responsive, looks great and can be played in short burst. Also no IAP which automatically garners 2 stars right off the bat.<br />If you like the shooter genre genre. Then the buck stops right here. I'm looking forward to a sequel and more from the developer.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was chosen for my Book Club and I think it was a wonderful choice. It was so interesting: learning the other side of the law. It was compelling and riveting. I lived those moments with that Mother as she went through the task of arrest and courtroom drama. The author explained the procedure to a fault. I would recommend this good to anyone.

B007REV4YI|4.0|Skyfall must count as one of the best of all James Bond films. All the standard elements -- exotic locales, just-barely-possible action sequences, and a super-villain -- are there, handled more excellently, in cinematic terms, than in any other Bond film I can remember. And the villain this time (an excellent performance by Javier Bardem) is genuinely scary, and less unbelievably ambitious than most Bond villains: rather than wanting to take over the world, he has the more modest goal of merely destroying the British intelligence service. Sex and violence are of course part of the mix, but here they aren't gratuitous or graphic enough to put many people off. The characters of Bond and M are given more depth than usual by having to face the consequences of their own aging and the unresolved complexities of their relationship.The supporting performances are good-to-excellent, with B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Marlohe particularly memorable as a Bond girl who can actually act, giving a compelling performance as a dazzlingly beautiful woman barely suppressing her near-hysterical terror under a mask of sophisticated seductiveness.Many fans will also find it interesting that, though there is a new, genius-level Q, there is less emphasis on razzle-dazzle technical spy gear than usual. Indeed, one motif of the film is Bond's reverting to old fashioned kit like a pocket radio transmitter and a plain old automatic pistol.Technically, the film is of high excellence, and the DVD transfer (I'm speaking of the standard DVD by MGM, I haven't seen the Blu-Ray) awesomely vivid.All in all, I'd say five stars if you're a real Bond fan, three if you aren't, and four for the rest of us.
1451695195|5.0|When my husband passed away in 2011 I became much more curious about the after life that we read about in the Bible.<br />This is the second book I have read on the subject and I do probably feel that it reinforced my beliefs since he is a man of science and a neurologist.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|The effects are very impressive and I like how they go back to young Kirks youth on earth a bit and develop the family history for background.

031603441X|5.0|Keith Richards may be the only living icon who could write such an unflinching and insightful account of his journey and make it as joyful and honest as his music. With each chapter, the reader sees a new line appearing on his face, but somehow, just as when he takes the stage now, the patina of age and experience is a triumph.
147674355X|5.0|I came across this book after reading a review of Sylvia Day's new book that said, skip that one and read this!  I'm sure glad I did.  The book is great - and there's actually a very compelling storyline beyond Dean and Sky's romance.  5 stars!
B007REV4YI|2.0|I'll keep it short because it'll get buried beneath all the other reviews, but here goes - Skyfall isn't a bad movie, persay. But like the world it portrays - one where the terrorist genre is changing, lurking in the \\"shadows\\" - Skyfall doesn't do anything interesting in its act of revisiting a classic genre. The fighting scenes are sparse and uninteresting, the romance quick and bland (without spoiling it, it jumps in to the film as suddenly as it exists), and the \\"bad guy,\\" as it was, could not have been any more useless.<br /><br />Its cardinal sin is that it tells, not shows - it tells you the villain is scary, that Bond is amazing, that the world is changing. But the villain does all of his activities either before the film starts or off-screen, Bond's personality is a hundred times more muted than his Casino Royale self, and the world is just gunshots and accidental victories. If it could prove to us that its core premise was worth believing, this movie would get more than two stars. As it stands, I'm not entirely sure I'm not being generous.
B00BZAJMWG|4.0|{3.5 stars}<br /><br />An interesting combination of qualities: Some will call it a winning one; some will call it otherwise.<br /><br />SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK doesn't quite work as a conventional comedy because it just *isn't all that funny. As a drama about mental illness, it falls short because it tries too hard to be funny, and the lead characters are such stereotypical bipolars. In either case, the scenes of violence are horribly fake. As a kind of funny-serious social satire on how everyone, along with the society they create and inhabit, is nuts, this film works VERY well, even if it does take some time to develop.<br /><br />The first half drags and is a bit unfocused; moreover, it seems overwrought with acting, script, and directions that try a bit too hard to portray crazy people. I found it very frustrating but soon discovered that it provided good set-up for the second half. There is also some nice and subtle foreshadowing here regarding the craziness of Pat (Cooper)'s family and all the other supposedly normal people in the film. While Jennifer Lawrence (as Tiffany) over-acts--just as Cooper does-- it helps to elucidate the less stereotypical side of her in the second half. Her script--see the line I've used as my title--and entire character contribute a great deal to this film. The second half is also sometimes repetitive and unfocused, but the whole theme really shines through, and it could not end any better. Tiffany and Pat's dance scene is riveting (and I'll admit, pretty funny).<br /><br />In the end, it's fitting that a film about craziness follows such a crazy structure.<br /><br />*Many obviously disagree with me on whether or not this film is truly funny. I'm just calling it as I see it.

0865479410|5.0|It's kind of ironic that our pursuits of happiness often result in increases of misery. Relentless striving for lives full of positivity, good cheer, security, and success has paradoxically derailed many from the path of happiness. (What's wrong with this picture?)<br /><br />Shedding insight into this self-help paradox, the author Oliver Burkeman points out that:<br />\\"There is something about trying to *make ourselves* happy and successful that is precisely what sabotages the attempt...Through positive thinking and related approaches, we seek the safety and solid ground of certainty, of knowing how the future will turn out, of a time in the future when we'll be ceaselessly happy and never have to fear negative emotions again. But, in chasing all that, we close down the very facilities that permit us the happiness we crave.\\" (pp. 103, 135)<br /><br />Maybe it's time to consider a new kind of happiness with a different kind of path?<br /><br />That's exactly what Burkeman proposes in this brilliant gem of book. He suggests a counter-intuitive approach to happiness (whatever that is), which arises through embracing negativity:<br />\\"This kind of happiness has nothing to do with the easy superficialities of positive thinking--with the grinning insistence on optimism at all costs, or the demand that success be guaranteed. It involves much more difficulty--and also much more authenticity--than that...If a fixation on positivity is the disease, this approach is the antidote.\\" (p. 211-212, 9)<br /><br />This antidote to the unrealistic happiness promised by the self-help \\"cult of optimism\\" entails developing \\"negative capability\\"--the ability to tolerate the existential givens of groundlessness, failure, insecurity, uncertainty, and, yes, even death. Burkeman takes us on a tour of how the Stoics and Buddhists have developed this ability, and also shows how the rest of us can do it too:<br />\\"For the Stoics, the realisation that we can often choose not to be distressed by events, even if we can't choose events themselves, is the foundation of tranquility. For the Buddhists, a willingness to observe the `inner weather' of your thoughts and emotions is the key to understanding that they need not dictate your actions. Each of these is a different way of resisting the `irritable reaching' after better circumstances or better thoughts and feelings. But negative capability need not involve embracing an ancient philosophical or religious tradition. It is also the skill you're exhibiting when you move forward with a project--or with life--in the absence of sharply defined goals; when you dare to inspect your failures; when you stop trying to eliminate feelings of insecurity; or when you put side `motivational' techniques in favour of actually getting things done.\\" (pp. 207-208)<br /><br />So, cancel your membership to the self-help cult of optimism and start subscribing to life-as-it-really-is. And, be prepared to find happiness (or some approximation thereof) where you least expect it.events, even if we can't choose events themselves, is the foundation of tranquility.

Thanks, Robin!
B008KP6ENE|5.0|got this free as free game of the day but would totally be worth the .99.  Flash backs to the days of Mario bros.  jumping on bad guys; moving platforms and transporting down pipes.  graphics are much better though; characters are so colorful and cute.  lots of checkpoints so you can always put it down and come back later.
B0082Z447U|4.0|I really enjoyed the book!  The story line had real mystery and suspense.<br />I also like the old world charm of that time period.<br />If you enjoy reading the old classics of Dickens and Austen, you should enjoy this as well.

193700788X|4.0|This is the last book in the Sookie Stackhouse series and although I haven't been as enthusiastic about the past few books in the series, I still wanted to finish reading it and see how things were resolved with all of the characters.  I really enjoyed this book and it came at a perfect time for me because I was feeling in a bit of a reading slump, especially around fiction.<br /><br />These books are such fun and easy reads for me and I quickly devoured this one.  I found it to be very similar to the others as far as expectations.  There was the usual details of Sookie's everyday life described and I found this nice because I knew what would happen when I read the book.<br /><br />One thing that was different about this book was that it wasn't written entirely from Sookie's perspective.  There were portions that involved other people and were used to make a part of the plot more mysterious and add suspense.  I enjoyed these as they weren't too long and they got you wondering what was going on.<br /><br />I've seen a lot of reviews and many people aren't happy with the ending.  I won't give away any spoilers but I didn't feel as strongly as most about Sookie and her relationships. I think maybe I haven't been that involved in the series and one of the relationships seemed forced and out of nowhere.  But at the same time it was realistic that Sookie didn't want to jump into anything serious.<br /><br />Overall I really enjoyed this book.  I'm glad the series is wrapping up and I did find satisfaction and closure.  It also made me want to possibly start watching True Blood again which I haven't seen in ages.  So the enjoyability factor was high for me and I liked how things were wrapped up and nothing was left unanswered at the end.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Great movie saw it in the theatre. Had to see it again. Highly recommended. Great from beginning to end. That's ALL
B007UQRW62|5.0|I'd forgotten what a masterpiece this movie is.  And the box set was great!!  While some of it is frivolity, like the umbrella, the book that came with it, alone, justifies the price.  It was interesting to read about each of the actors, and key production personnel came to create or be involved with this film.<br /><br />The extras were interesting as well.  I put it in thinking I'd watch the first five minutes and ended up not turning it off until it was finished.<br /><br />The quality of the movie, played on our 65&#34; screen looked and sounded great.  I've never bought a box set before as it always seemed like an inflated waste of money, but I would definitely recommend this, even if you are just a moderate fan of the movie.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|I was not thrilled with this film. Don't really know why. Maybe because I just watched Parker which was much higher Octane than A Good day to ....<br />No Father/Son chemistry in this film

I love their videos, their humor, and the variety of music they offer.  I can't believe the fullness of sound with so few instruments - mainly piano, cello and percussion only.
B00756GRUE|5.0|This watch is a very nice chronograph piece that has a bold look that is distinct with blue trim color.  It is a fairly big piece on the wrist, but not too big or over-sized...for me it's just the right size.  It looks bold but not overpowering.  The Seiko quartz is very accurate, and one of the main selling points for me was the solar power feature.  I've owned automatic watches that lose their accuracy over time, whereas this watch should not since it is quartz and solar/battery powered.  My wife owns a Citizen eco drive which is also a great reliable watch, however, this Seiko was cheaper than any comparable Citizen I could find.  The only negative is the date display which is very small and looks to be deeply recessed in the face of the watch...a shortcoming that for me is a non-factor.  Overall I'm very happy with my purchase, both with the product and the price.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|PLEASE WRITE MORE. I COULD NOT STOP READING. THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT NOW? Five stars all the way!
B005KDWUFA|5.0|Great new songs by this group.  I love the interpretations of some &#34;newer&#34; songs.  Some really really great ones on this album.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|The whole family loved this movie. The grandkids always want to watch it on family movie Fridays. Grandma & grandpa...? Yes , we liked it also, but with our 15 year old min-pin starting to go down hill, we can not watch it again right now. A tear jerker.<br /><br />It does make me want to read the book about the real Hachi.
1401937519|5.0|Whenever you think that you've got life problems, or feel stuck in a rut, or feel like life isn't fair, pick up this book. I do cry when I read inspirational books, but this book didn't make me cry. It made be grateful, sad, empathetic, courageous, and determined about my own life in turns. This book is about life lessons, the ones that really matter. It's a good one for older kids (high school age) as well as for adults who have forgotten how to be grateful for all the blessings in our lives (and who doesn't do that from time to time)? Highly recommended as a reminder of gratitude and all that life offers us daily!
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Bought as a gift for my father.  He was thrilled with with the Blue Ray and digital package.  He was happy and that's all that mattered.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and bought it for my daughters.  Sheryl provides a great perspective from her experience as well as observations for the educational community.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I've only had this app for a week, I really like it. I like that this app also lets you know exactly how much time you actually have left before you need to recharge your item. In my case, my Kindle.. I may change my mind down the road. But for now, I'm quite happy with this app.
193700788X|4.0|I really enjoyed Dead Ever After and I was happy to see the series end. The last few books have been underwhelming, so my expectations for the final installment were quite low. However, I found Dead Ever After to be a wonderful conclusion that ended the series on a good note.<br /><br /> I'm not quite sure why I've seen such negative reviews, although I'm sure it has something to do with who Sookie ended up with or who she didn't end up with. I won't spoil the book or the conclusion, but I was happy with the result. I have always thought there were 3 characters I would have been happy to see Sookie end up with and I would have also liked to see Sookie alone. Either way, it doesn't matter because I wouldn't rate a series or a book lower because I'm bitter about the heroine's choices. It's not like Sookie ended up with some new guy that showed up on page 200, which is probably the only instance where I'd be a little upset. After all, 13 books is a long time to get to know the various people in Sookie's life and get to know Sookie herself. Sometimes she's alone, sometimes she isn't. And sometimes people surprise her.<br /><br /> The adventure in Dead Ever After was crazy, as always, and involved mostly all characters from earlier novels. I've always loved how Sookie ends up in the middle of a crazy plot and has to figure out why she's involved, who is behind everything, and who to trust. Somehow, it hasn't gotten old in 13 books. But perhaps it helped to know this was the last one. I really enjoyed how Dead Ever After jumped from scene to scene in certain areas so that the reader was aware of a plot, but not necessarily who the people were behind it. It made for an interesting read as far as the mystery was concerned.<br /><br /> I loved the overall feeling I got from the book, which was that Sookie always had friends, no matter what happened. Whenever she found herself in a bind and people started to suspect her of terrible things, she had the support of some amazingpeople and creatures who were willing to help her. I couldn't believe Sookie would get arrested when I read the synopsis, but I actually loved that part because of how many people stood by her. As the last book in the series, I thought that really showed me what Sookie has achieved in her previous adventures in the last 12 books.<br /><br /> Sookie is such a wonderful character and the other supporting characters in the novels have been wonderful, too, even when the plot was lacking in some of the previous books. At the end of the day, I thought Dead Ever After was a great conclusion to an amazing series. It's lighthearted, entertaining, and full of awesome characters and the last book fit the rest of the series perfectly. I have no complaints. I'm not sad to see the series end, even though I'll miss Sookie and her crazy adventures.<br /><br /> I highly recommend the series to fans of paranormal books. For an adult paranormal series, it's a lot less raunchy than other popular series and it's quite humorous and entertaining. It's a great paranormal series for fans of YA because it doesn't get quite as \\"mature\\" as many adult paranormal romances, despite the impression the HBO show True Blood gives. At the same time, it's definitely adult and deals with mature themes. Sookie Stackhouse is a pretty memorable character who stands out in fiction and I'm definitely a fan.<br /><br />Review originally published at Love, Literature, Art, and Reason book review blog<br />http://meganm922.blogspot.com/2013/05/reviewdead-ever-after-sookie-stackhouse.html<br /><br />Source: I purchased a hardcover copy of this book.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I waited 7 long months for this book and I'm not disappointed!! ! Fortunately I read Sylvia Day's apology on her website before reading the book so I went into reading knowing there will be two more books! However I am not complaining because no matter how impatient I get a little part of me likes looking forward to something especially if that something is Gideon Cross!! Okay about the actual story ! I really liked it the only drawback I had was with all the DRAMA!! Jesus it was like never ending !!! I wanted to throw something!! Lol and i have sooo many questions left unanswered it was kinda irritating!!! I swear to the heavens if Gideon did anything with that Corinne I will go postal!!! As why I gave it four stars well that's simply because I loved Gideon's and Eva's story from the beginning! I really hope they can put everything past them and find their HEA!
B005WUHAX8|5.0|very nice but did take a while to get use to the cover over the screen, made texing a bit difficult at first
B004QOB8SY|5.0|Absolutely Incredible! It keeps getting better and keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way through! Waiting for season 3.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I loved The Maze Runner. It had such an interesting concept that kept me on my toes the entire time. I loved the way it was executed -how I was trying to figure out the world the same way as Thomas, the main character. The fact that all of the kids had limited memory meant that the reader and the characters were unraveling the mystery as we went. Each new piece to the puzzle was examined by all of the characters in the Glade and by me, the reader, too. I just loved this aspect and I think it's what made the story even more engaging.<br /><br />The Maze Runner was a brilliant novel and I highly recommend it. I almost don't know what to say because I knew literally nothing when I started the book and I think it added to my own reading experience. Thomas, the main character, woke up in box with barely any memory other than his own name. He had no idea how old he was, where he came from, or where he was. The box was opened and he found himself staring at a group of other kids and teenagers in a place they called the Glade. They wouldn't tell him much, kept using strange slang he was unfamiliar with, and each Glader had a different job. They sort of set up their own society in the middle of a maze. They were given supplies by the same unknown entity that gave them a new member in the box each month. And they all had one focus: figure out the maze so they can all go home. Even though none of them had any idea where home was or what home was like. They knew nothing outside of their own society they built for themselves.<br /><br />Thomas knew right away he wanted to be a Runner -the one job that required you to go into the maze and attempt to figure it out. Thomas's presence led to strange happenings in the Glade and broke the normal routine that the kids living there relied on. Order was incredibly important and Thomas shook that order up, partly due to his drive, but also due to circumstances beyond his control. The doors to the maze closed each night and opened each morning and walls inside of the maze were thought to change each night as well, making the maze virtually impossible to solve. Especially because there were terrible creatures living in the maze that attacked and killed whoever they came across. If a person got stung, he would go through what they called the Changing and wake up a little less normal with haunting memories that faded over time.<br /><br />I can't give any more of the story away without ruining awesome moments. The premise was stunning. The book was one big puzzle/mystery, but also one with action, character development, and survival. And quite possibly a post apocalyptic story, if the characters memories were correct after the Changing. And on top of all of that, the story was also dystopian. Someone created the maze. Someone was watching the kids. Someone was giving them supplies. And someone was taking away their memories. But who?<br /><br />I've seen such mixed reviews about this book and I honestly don't understand the negative ones. I thought The Maze Runner was so unique, creative, and awesome and it was also well written with likeable, well developed characters. Perhaps the only thing that is missing from this story that The Hunger Games and Divergent (the two books it is compared to) have is a romance. But I don't think there was really a place for it in The Maze Runner. There was a hint of a romantic connection that I don't think should have been explored anymore than it was in the book. I can't think of any other reason anyone would not finish or love this book if they are fans of other YA adventure, dystopian, or post apocalyptic fiction.<br /><br />I will definitely continue the series and I highly recommend the book.<br /><br />Review Originally Published at Love, Literature, Art, and Reason Book Review Blog<br /><br />http://meganm922.blogspot.com/2013/05/reviewthe-maze-runner-by-james-dashner.html<br /><br />Source: Kindle Library Lending
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|The world that Ms. Singh has created in this series is so amazing. I have read every book and have been awed by the story line and all the characters and have not been disappointed.  I was always intrigued when Kaleb first came in the picture and wanted to know his story. To have been a protege' of S. Enrique you knew he had to be unemotional and cold. It is really hard sometimes for an author to take this type of character and make him lovable but Ms. Singh has done it. Kaleb is still cold but as the story develops you get to understand why he has to be this way. His love for Sahara which he considers a defect in the Psy world is the only thing that keeps him sane since he could practically take over the whole world.  I would recommend this book to anyone who love the tortured hero and a strong heroine. You could read this as a stand alone but if you do you will not understand the PSY/Changling world. Thanks Ms. Singh for another amazing book. BTW if you love this series read her Archangel series.....you love them!

B00338QENI|4.0|I had little knowledge about stem cell research before reading  this book. It also made me angry because the family was treated badly, by the medical establishment..  Interesting and informative. I think people need to know about what happens to their body parts after surgery,(umbilical cord, tonsils, appendix ,etc.)
B00D2K40WY|2.0|Fun game, but it could be better.  It needs more dresses and makeup choices. This game is a little boring, but for first timers it's cool. Can't play it a lot or you get too familiar with it.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|Loved it.  Can't wait for the next one. I really was surprised with the death of Jon Snow. Great book.
1611138434|5.0|This was a very compelling book about a horrible subject told through the innocent eyes of a child who has been lovingly protected by his mother from how terrible their situation really is. I listenend to the audiobook version, and found the narration, done by several different voice actors, to be excellent. The main narration is done by a child's voice, and the story can be listened to by all ages because the worst parts of the story are between the lines - the unspoken autrocities that the child doesn't understand, but an adult hears more than is said. Well written and thouroughly thought out, I found the story to hold together well - even the parts where Jack uses big words in some parts and more immature language in others. He has obviously been taught well by his mother, and yet still does not fully understand much of what he knows. Like the game he plays called &#34;parrot&#34; - he can repeat large sections of what he has just heard on the TV, but doesn't have any idea what it is they are talking about. I recommend this book!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it the only two things I don't like are the controls and how long it takes the Amazon app store to update the app so please take that as the only 2 bad things about it ENJOY IT
0425263924|5.0|This series is going gangbusters.  I loved this story and it fit right in with the previous books.  I don't want to do any spoiling so I'll just say that I am glad that this doesn't have quite the cliffhanger ending that the last one did which makes waiting for book four a little easier.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I love this show.  The auto-tuning is a bit much at times.  However, the characters develop into real people with interesting personalities, the plot twists are often welcome even if foreseen, and the music makes me weep with emotion.  Let me be your star, indeed!
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|I games; simply put, amazing. I love the fact that you can take to your team! I play both on my kindle and my S4. love it.

B00B5HQKNI|5.0|The Bond films really jumped in quality with the reboot with Daniel Craig as Bond, and each one has gotten better. In this one we have London itself under attack, and we see terrific scenes of destruction in the tube and in Parliament. Javier Bardem is one of the most sinister villains ever.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's not updating to the new update but my brother got the update. This is horrible my friend got it too I just hope I can
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Brendon Coyle does an excellent job in creating endearing characters, good storylines and sound morals.  You have Dorcas, the strong independent woman whose love is socially forbidden, young Jenny who is innocent and sweet, her father Mr. Timmens who is an independent thinker and kind-hearted man, and crotchety Zella who has a unique story to tell.  These plus many others tie together numerous enjoyable stories that only get better with the telling.  A definite keeper in my librabry!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|This book was not her best. The story did not pick up till the last chapters. I was disappointed.<br />Don't know if I will continue this story. I feel this book was not worth 9.99.
B00BLGXL3U|4.0|This study of the early years of a fictionalized (dare I say it?) L. Ron Hubbard (Scientologists are after me now!), seen through the eyes of a primitive (Joaquin Phoenix)  who goes on to be the spiritual leader's right-hand-man, is captivating. The movie does not move beyond the early '50s, but it's a fascinating look at the culture of the time and puts forth a persuasive scenario as to how such a bizarre cult could have gotten started. There is a group nude scene in the middle of the film that manages to be shocking and titillating, even in this day and age. Philip Seymour Hoffman is brilliant as The Master.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Well because mojang is still working on Mac Windows Apple anidroids and kindle fire relax they are working really hard
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This app is simply the best I've seen so far. It does not appear to hinder any other app. It takes the guess work out of findng how much charge is left on the battery.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|At first it took a moment to get the hang of this but after some practice it becomes a challenge that is. The kind of heart thumping mind tingling on my edge toe curling fuuuuuun.. if u like temple run you'll love this
B00BHU9BV6|4.0|I guess in Tolstoy, difficulty keeping track of the characters comes with the territory. Confusion is increased by the means by which this production is framed: we start out with a proscenium, and the conceit is we're watching a stage production, but we go on to have the story set in all kinds of naturalistic settings, with transitions always harkening back to the stage-play notion. I had a hard time remembering when we were in Moscow and when in St. Petersburg. But about a third of the way through I got the hang of it, and enjoyed it. Keira Knightly has one of those faces that looks so familiar, but I checked IMDB and couldn't identify anything else I'd seen her in. She is a beauty to be sure, and a fine, nuanced actress. What brought me to this film was the presence of Ruth Wilson, with whom I am in love, thanks to her work on the British detective show Luther. Here she plays a completely opposite character, a vain, preening, foolish flibbertigibbet. She brings a nice knowing satirical edge to playing this princess. The dance scenes are stupendous.
B000060P79|5.0|Simple Plan is my favorite band in the entire world (tied to some others, of course), and this is one of the few albums that has every song this good. I know every single song from this album. I've heard every song from beginning to end and I think this is especially a gold mine. This is a must-have and a top priority to any fan of rock. If someone ever told me they dont like Simple Plan, i wouldn't care, although i would ask \\"Are you crazy? Simple Plan is the best\\". You have your opinions, I have mine, and its best for me not to care if someone thinks Simple Plan is bad. Again, they're my favorite (mainly because I can tell who Pierre, David, Chuck, Jeff, and Sebastian are). Here is the review for this album:<br /><br />Actually, every song is a 5/5. It's that SIMPLE.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|This was a surprise. I expected the movie to be bad, but as soon as I saw Ethan Hawke I knew it couldn't be bad. At the beginning it was slow, but it picks up. The plot is original, so you don't feel like you are having dejavu like with the millions of possession or haunted house movies. It is creepy in an unique way, instead of going for the loud-noise-sudden-appearance technique of all horror movies nowadays. It plays with your mind, kind of like The Exorcist did. I am glad I gave it a chance because, even though I am a huge horror movie fan, I have been very skeptical about horror movies lately because of the garbage that I have seen come out.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|If everyone had been reading on Sylvia Day's website, they wouldn't be shocked that the story didn't end at with Entwined! I am beyond excited that the story didn't end with this book and can't wait to read the 4th and 5th books! I love Gideon and Eva and can't wait to see their relationship develop further. It would have been silly to end the story here!! I was mad about the way it ended.. sure! But I was mad at how Reflected ended too. lol! I just hate when they end.. that's why I'm so excited there are more books coming in the Crossfire series! I'm ready to read the other books right now! I can't wait to see what happens next with Cary and Tat, Cary and Trey, Corrine, Elizabeth, Ireland, Eva's parents, the BIG wedding, Deanna, oh and of course BRETT! And just want is up with Lucus's wife?! Oh and there's Mark & Steven... and where is Megumi?? Stanton.. Lacey.. Magdeline is being sneaky.. There's soooo many ends left open! Sylvia wrote another steamy book and the next two will be just as awesome, I'm sure! I will be watching her website, waiting for the release date of book 4... I'm even pumped to find out the TITLE of the newest Crossfire book!!!!!
B002BCNK1Q|4.0|My dad was taken with this movie when he watched it on cable TV, so I decided to give it a shot. It was not surprising to me that he liked it; lead character Walt Kowalski's (Eastwood) love of tools and respect for hard work is right up his alley. A Hmong family moves in next door to Kowalski, and while he at first wants nothing to do with them, due to his distrust of other races, he is drawn into their world, and becomes a mentor to an awkward teenage boy in the family. Ultimately he gets involved with helping the boy stand up to the Hmong gang that is terrorizing him. Kowalski's efforts to teach the kid how to be a regular guy, Detroit working-class style, are a bit jarringly corny, but the drama builds engrossingly. Ultimately we wind up with a religious message, which could be off-putting, but comes across as real and inevitable. Ahney Her deserves special mention as the boy's sister Sue, a very intelligent teen who has adapted well to the U.S., can relate to Kowalski and is primarily responsible for bringing him round. She is so likable. Hope we'll see more of her somewhere.
B004EBT5CU|2.0|Adele is a respected musician in pop music lately, especially since pop music is crap nowadays. There are a boatload of reviews of this CD that have a positive rating. However, I am not one of those people. Adele is praised for working hard and not just popping out of the blue and making a garbagy song and peaking it at #1 like ridiculously garbagy artists like Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Ke$ha, Justin Bieber, ETC., but I think this album is just whiny vocals (one thing in music I try to avoid) and misplaced lyrics. I also try to avoid seeing the ridiculously creepy album cover which shows a majority of her face. Rolling in the Deep is one of the worst songs ever. Overall, I don't like Adele's music, but she is praised by me for not being a complete gullible mess in the music industry.
B0000AI44Q|4.0|This 2003 release by Neil Young and those grungy guys of Crazy Horse is a solid (but not super) collection of songs that basically tell a story. This concept album features some nice riffs, and even-flowing and smooth songs throughout. I've always loved the band Crazy Horse, and this album (while not their best) manages to hold my interest. To be frank, it's an acquired taste, so listen to this one several times. The bonus DVD is excellent.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I used to have this app when I had an iPod touch. I immediately looked for on the Kindle Fire HD. It's a great app. Use it daily
B000SZDMES|4.0|On this CD Ellington teams up with Charles Mingus, which already makes it pretty much worth the price. This is early '60s Ellington, at a point where people had pretty much stopped paying attention to him, but the man kept on writing and playing. '60s Ellington has a certain sound to it; I would describe it as sounding like each chord has one too many notes in it. Not that it sounds bad--it's intriguing, but strange enough to be appealing to only a select audience. The title of the album is of course very evocative, and the music does give us that noir feel that it's a hard, complex world out there.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think this a fun game for little kids to learn about responsibility. And it teaches them in kind of an misunderstandable way... for instance they talk about tack and paddocks... like any little girl or boy would understand what that means... so I rate &quot;My Horse&quot; 4stars.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|One thing,maybe two,that I don't like,red pudding,and it has an eye!But beyond that it was a good game.Don't get me wrong,their is a couple things that would have made it better.
0739380338|5.0|I know series is have to in but I wish that this winter went on a little longer. And that could have been at least more about what this group of kids were able to do. I enjoyed it very much in the Me on the edge of my seat. And I enjoyed it very much on CD.
1440503257|4.0|I received this book as a gift and have tried out a few of the recipes. Some of the more basic HP food items were pretty easy for anyone to make--I tried Rock Cakes, Ice Mice, and Treacle Tarts. They were simple enough and the directions were easy to follow. Some of the recipes are definitely on the more difficult end of things, though, and there were a number of items I would never eat or make. But for anyone who loves the HP series, this is a nice addition.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Yes this is a toy, and not what was used on the real show, but the sound effect are good.  In my eyes the pen tips are kind of useless, but still a fun thing to mess around with.
B00BJDARGO|5.0|Excellent product, the concert is very good, great video and audio quality.  There is also an adequate resolution since it is a blueray disc.

0307711773|5.0|this was the first book in the series. And it introduced me to new and in more interesting people. I enjoyed it very much testing of how it was on CD. It made me able to read a book in my own way.
B000002G26|5.0|thank you the movie is on wonderful condition. I love it I listen to it almost everday and I can't get enough of it.
1451697686|4.0|This book gives new meaning to the old saw \\"Use it up, wear it out, make it do, or do without.\\" Though the author has gone beyond the call of duty in her own life, she is realistic. Achieving absolute zero is not quite possible. Re-thinking everything you do and coming up with ways to do them differently calls for re-tooling your life. I want to reduce the amount of refuse in my life and will implement some of her ideas. However, I won't freeze bread in pillow cases or ask the butcher to stuff ground beef in a glass jar. I can feel good about cutting back on disposable water bottles, paper plates, cardboard, and the like, but what bothers me more than that is electronic trash, or e-waste, like  televisions, computers, laptops, printers, tablets, and smart phones. Taking the old laptop to some recycling center doesn't necessarily mean that it is disposed of safely. The innards can end up in a toxic dump somewhere in the world. It's something to think about while concocting homemade hair spray, which by the way, isn't very effective, as I happen to know.
B00APUTEBG|3.0|Basic action flick with a touch of thriller.<br /><br />Don't expect to be wow'd. The story/plot could have used some more development to make it feel more complete at the end.<br />There are a few spots of &#34;I wish there was more explained here&#34; or &#34;Oh, thats all they are going to say on that?&#34;<br /><br />Again, a basic action-ish movie with a semi-thrilling twist. Something to have on in the background while you game
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|the first season of lost girl. Fat up the rest of the series and made it very interesting and Me enthralled. And coming back for more.
B009A87Z6U|3.0|Q of S has its problems, but direction isn't one of them. Apparently I'm in the minority, but I actually enjoyed the direction of Marc Foster. The film is gorgeous to look at. I like the quick-cutting style, it makes the movie more intense, and the movie's many frenetic action scenes are handled very well, in my opinion. In particular, the sequence in the opera house is an absolute stunner and unlike anything else in any Bond film. Craig and the rest of the cast is excellent.<br /><br />I thought the film could have used a bit more humor, even though Bond is bent on revenge. But the problem lies in the story. It is barely intelligible. At times was a real struggle to try to pinpoint exactly why something was happening. For example, at one point an associate of Bond was locked in the trunk of the car, and I have no idea why. Things blow up for no reason. With the film's slim running time of only about 1:45, I felt like they could have utilized a few minutes here and there to solidify and flesh out the plot a bit.

B00BUAEYVK|3.0|I won't go into a dissertation of the movie since that has already been spouted off here.<br /><br />My wife and I are huge Die Hard fans and 1 thru 4 were all good films.<br /><br />#5 a good day to die hard left us disappointed with the total lack of the typical die hard film. Their was so much potential to this film and it was never pursued. The plot was as if someone who had never been involved in the franchise wrote it. The producers and the director left too many holes and never developed each scenario into a more intricate challenge that could have elevated the film. What you saw in the previews of the film were never used. Everytime we expected a die hard moment it turned out totally flat. It appears they made this film to just try and make money and never took it seriously enough to make it entertaining<br /><br />We know it is a Die Hard film<br />We know that everywhere John goes huge messes end up happening<br />We also know the deeper he gets the more the bad guys want to kill him<br /><br />But this film just didn't build up.........and the ending was bland. Looks like Die hard just died............

B00007GZR5|5.0|If you don't get this movie after 3 viewings, you probably never will.<br /><br />Two very life-important quotes from the movie:<br /><br />1. \\"Sometimes when you win, you lose.\\"<br />2. \\"The real hell is your life gone wrong.\\"<br /><br />Live your life by these two sayings, and you'll do pretty good.
B00BEXB18M|3.0|I am a huge Megadeth fan and have been since the 80's. I would rank this album toward the bottom of their list and here is why...<br /><br />Megadeth albums have always had one or two things going for them and in a few cases both. 1. They have guttural power with creative riffs and have moments of unrelenting drive. 2. They are produced well and mixed well making certain moments throughout the disk seem greater than the sum of its parts. The early albums had a ton of power and rage but lower production value (which is why the remixes are worth listening to). Rust in Peace (far and away their best album) had both power and production value along with Countdown, Youthanasia and a couple others. Then there are the albums like Thirteen and Endgame that have moments of power and interesting riffs but very high production value making them worth owning.<br /><br />Unfortunately this album does not really know what it is.  It's production value and flow as an album are not great. In fact Thirteen was a much better sounding record. In addition, it lacks any real power either lyrically or musically.  It is a lot of filler and not a lot of killer. Lastly, Dave's kind of transition to &#34;holy man&#34; is a little too evident in a couple of the songs for me (those of you who read his biography know what I am talking about). It is hard for to take lyrics seriously which talk about &#34;being all heaven can see,&#34; and &#34;Come with me and I will free your soul,&#34; from a guy who has made a 30 year living whipping listeners into a dark, speed metal frenzy. Now I know people change, but Dave has lost his edge...at least on this album.<br /><br />So, why do I still give it 3 stars? Because it does have glimpses of power and some interesting riffs both in Kingmaker and a few songs deep into the disk. Also, this is not a bad sounding album...it is mixed well but again, it really does not flow as an album.<br /><br />My suggestion is to preview a few songs, definitely invest inthe digital version of Kingmaker and maybe check out a couple other tunes but don't spend the money on the whole disk or entire digital album. You will spend most of your time skipping over tracks.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I have to say I agree w/a lot of the reviews. What a disappointment! I was so looking forward to this next book, but it was a waste of my time. The story didn't go anywhere, it was rather dull in fact. This story could of been concluded very nicely in this book, instead it was dragged out w/a lot of dribble. It just seemed like the book went on and on with no real purpose, and never really added anything. And the way she left the story line end, I can see it ending in a couple of different directions, but because of how Sylvia handled this book, I don't think I even want to wait around for another. I would love to see a happy ending for Gideon and Eva, but after wasting my money on this book, I just don't think it's worth it! Sorry Sylvia, you took a good story and ruined it by dragging it out trying to make more money. You could of ended perfectly with this book!
0449014509|5.0|this book Me on the edge of my seat for a very long time. And I enjoyed it very much I was thankful it was on CD. I hope the next book in the series will come out on CD. At this time it's only in book form. If it only comes out in book form the series will end for me here. I won't be able to find out what happens to Percy Jackson and all his friends.

B009MYARIK|5.0|Perfect beach book.  I found it laugh out loud hilarious.  The conversations and texts between Fliss and her sister, Lottie, were great.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|I know that it has been said many times before--however--the adaption from book to movie was not good.  I wish they would have taken time to develop the characters more and not combined two characters (from the book) into one.  The story is such a good one and I wish they would have stuck closer too it.  If someone watches the movie who has not read the book, I am sure they will enjoy it.

B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Kaleb is the bomb!! LOL, do people still say that?  No matter, you get my meaning.  I fell for him from the beginning of the story.  I always felt that Kaleb was one of the bad guys, but it just goes to prove that it's hard to judge someone without knowing their background.  What makes them who they are?  At first it's hard to tell what Kaleb wants with his stolen prisoner.  Is it good or bad?  Then the truth slowly unravels and we see the whole picture.  He has \\"obsessive possessive madness\\" towards Sahara and he knows it.  He doesn't make an excuse for who he is.  All his decisions are centered around her.  She's his everything, his only defect in his Silence.  I love his total unbending commitment.<br />I didn't think the author could pull off better stories than she's already given but she has blown that theory out of the water.  This is one of the best!! I must read it again!
B00CL68NOG|5.0|This was really funny. I think I saw some of my self in this picture scary. They seem to have gotten a lot of their family issues worked out during this trip. But I think in the end he realized his Mom is not always wrong.
B00514HDNW|3.0|A good book, the psychology was spot on, but the \\"horror\\" book wasn't even scary. It had a good plot though, and was starting to enjoy the end of the book when he gave himself up and became a self proclaimed legend.
B00C5ZORES|2.0|I normally only buy specific songs but I decided to just download the album this time to give my playlist more variety.  That was my mistake.  I got it for &#34;My songs know what you did in the dark&#34; because even though the name and premise is kinda stupid, it is pretty darn catchy.  Seriously though, After this album, someone needs to save rock and roll because Fall Out Boy sure as hell can't do it!
B00CW665VI|5.0|What a wonderful surprise!  This book was fascinating from page one, all the way to the end.  It was also absolutely hilarious and had me laughing til I cried.  Unique in the best possible way.  I am a book junkie, and this may be the most enjoyable one I have read....ever!!

B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|Mr. Tough has written a well researched book that looks at how children succeed and what it takes to help them do so.  I highly encourage anyone who is interested in making this world a better place for our children to read this book.  We must, as a society but certainly as individuals, begin having the hard conversations about the impact of poverty on our children.  We can change this.  We can make a difference.
B008RZF2I0|4.0|When I heard about the singer replacing Roy Khan, I couldn't have been more excited for an upcoming Kamelot release. This one seems to have everything everyone loves about Kamelot, but Tommy K. makes it that much better. Great stuff..
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|This is a B movie action film. Cardboard characters with a lot of action. This could have been Steven Seagal's come back film. Its that bad! Do not rent this film its that bad. Watching it for free is a waste of time.

B008VSIAN2|5.0|Threshold has always been a great example of progressive melodic metal done right. This album is easily my favourite start to finish of all of theirs that I've heard (which is admittedly not all of theirs). Great hooks, great riffs, accessible melodies, with enough teeth to stay on the metal side of prog. I'm a bit less of a fan of the replacement singer, but he's still fine, and at times reminds you (esp due to harmony arrangements) of Jon Anderson of Yes.<br /><br />Well worth the admission price, imo.
B004DF3S7A|5.0|I loved this music and Rod's style. Makes for some special moments. His interpretation adds just the right tone to evoke fond memories.

B004SH40BQ|1.0|I used this product with my classic iPod, syncing it with my bluetooth speaker in the car.  It drained the battery in 20 minutes.  Thought maybe it was because the thing was new.  So I recharged my iPod fully, and tried again.  But once again, it completely drained the battery after just a few songs.  This is worthless.
B007V65R54|4.0|This is a very interesting read whether you are a math person or not. Silver gives many examples from everyday life and writes in a very relatable and easy to understand fashion. I enjoyed it cover to cover.
B008Y79IUE|5.0|Great performances all around, solid directing.  Right up there with many of the top drug culture movies.  Jennifer Connelly performance is tops...
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I was looking for a way to charge our mobile devices in the car. My wife and I each have iPhones, and I have an ipad.  I purchased this product based on the specs and reviews. I have not been disappointed. I have tried charging two iPhone 5 at the same time, and I have tested charging one iPhone 5 and one iPad 3 at the same time. Both scenarios have worked great. The unit itself is smaller than I expected based on the feedback of other reviewers. It is not tiny, but it isn't as big as some others have made it out to be. Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase and may be purchasing a second one for my wife's car.

B007REV4T8|5.0|Considering that the James Bond character has had so many movies (23 to be exactly said), once again Daniel Craig did a great job, compared to my all time favorite Sean Connery. Although  (for the 007-fans) you get a strong feeling that this is the end of the long living James Bond episodes. I miss them all.
0770437400|3.0|I knew going in about the format since the book was supposed to be a bit of a homage to the Good War book.  I really liked that book and I like zombies so I thought it was a good bet.  Most of the stories were interesting but after a few I came to realize that almost all of the \\"interviewees\\" were male.  I think less than five were women.  It's like we would have nothing to do with a war at all in this day and age.  Nothing to do with surviving it or coming up with a plan to survive or participating in the battles or anything.  So, I guess I would just be sitting at home waiting for the men to take care of things?  That totally ruined the book for me.  During the zombie apocalypse, I will be totally kicking some butt.  Why would he leave out 50 percent of the population?  Kind of weird.  Anyhow, like I said, halfway through after realizing that women weren't really in this book, I totally lost interest.  I read it but it was more of a \\"yeah, whatever when is the end\\".

080214473X|5.0|I am not one to shy away from difficult subjects, but Mark Bowden's Black Hawk Down is one of the most disturbing books which I have read in recent years and it is disturbing on so many levels, the loss of life, the senselessness, the clash of cultures, the fact that the necessary time was not taken to learn the essentials lessons from this, but instead a rush to put the past and Somalia behind us.<br /><br />Black Hawk Down is an account of a battle fought on October 23, 1993 in Mogadishu, Somalia and as Bowden says \\"it was one of the most one sided battles in American history.\\"  The Rangers and Delta fighters were up against unbelievable odds.  As Bowden states the loss of life for Somalis was catastrophic .  \\"Conservative counts numbered five hundred dead among more than a thousand casualties.\\"<br /><br />Bowden's intention was to create a book which read like a work of fiction, but was the true  chronological story of the events of the day.  He interviewed many of the survivors  and he took the time to find out about individual personalities of those involved, so he was able to give the book a very personal feel.  Bowden also took the time to explain the interplay and relationships between various forces as The Rangers and the Delta Force so the unschooled reader could understand.  Noteworthy as well is his interviews with Somalis describing both their actions that day and their attitudes.<br /><br />Once I picked up this book I could not put it down.  I became very involved in the lives of the people fighting and I felt a deep sadness for their losses.  There were so many individual stories which took hold of me.  My one wish was that Bowden had included a list of people and the beginning of the book which I could refer to.<br /><br />I would recommend to any one who enjoys war stories with the caution that it is also deeply troubling.

030789701X|5.0|As a collector of guide books, particularly hardcover books, this was an instant buy for me.  This guide books is very well laid out. Much better than the previous edition that only included Dawnguard and Hearthfire. The paper has a slick premium feel despite its thinness.  I should have bought two as I know this volume is going to get a lot of use as I finish my current play through with my Dragonborn Khajiit.

The end just ruined it all for me!!
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|Beware! The top reviews are old, and this no longer includes a 2nd disc. Extras are still there, just not all of what used to be.<br /><br />The images should be up-to-date; it comes with a 20ish pg booklet showing artwork and some thoughts from Anno, and the disk.

1781162646|2.0|If you've read Heart's in Atlantis, you may feel like this book has a similiar quality of the Atlantis book, told as a memoir.  That's where it stops.  I never write reviews, but I've been waiting for this book since Neil Gaiman did an interview with him a couple of years ago, where we found out he was writing Joyland.  I felt like it was a good idea for a book, but would have been better told if King elaborated on all the characters.  It felt like a, what where they, reader's digest condensed versions?  Yep, that's it.  I want the whole King story.  I want to say he condensed it for \\"hard case crime\\".  Who knows. No King universe references, I didn't catch anything from dark tower which left me dissapointed.  Lastly, the book is written very well.  I loved all of the characters, but in my opinion, I don't feel it was written in his true \\"voice\\".
B00821OX98|4.0|I enjoy a good &#34;disaster&#34; movie or show, and this one has been fun to watch. The story line pretty solid, the writing is mostly good, and the actors are great!  Now and then there are some cliche moments and even cliche characters, but I still think it all works well.  I'm almost finished watching the 2nd season, too, and have really enjoyed it.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I love all nalini's books, She is fantastic.<br />Also again with Heart of Obsidian she can say so many things with her characters without saying the words directly. Good Job!<br />Highly recommended to all Paranormal Romance lovers!

B004KPX5GC|1.0|Our first paid Amazon downloaded movie.  A great show for the first two hours, then the show stopped every 30 seconds to load.  Great idea On-Demand Video movies.  On high speed cable this product is of no use.<br /><br />We would love to rate the product but can not since we are unable to view it to the end.<br /><br />Amazon get's an F.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|Fast paced action, strong performances from Tom Cruise, Rosmumd Pike, a tightly written story that keeps you wanting more.<br />Cruise portrays a man who has no acceptance of wrong only what is right.  His unswerving determination to find out who has ken lives for an evil purpose without mercy for the wrong doers, keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|This was the perfect chick flick with a bit of suspense! Josh Duhamel was an incredibly hunky hero in this movie, and Julianne Hough was the perfect love interest/heroine.

B0027MJU00|5.0|After reading this book, I've become a Gillian Flynn fan (I have all her books now). That woman knows how to write a good, gritty story. And she's gutsy to include the nasty and dark stuff in her novels. I like that in a female author. This book took me a lot longer to finish because I refused to skim through it and skip chapters. Each character has a story about them. The devil worship is heavily mentioned throughout the novel, leading up to the night and what really happened near the end. I kept going to be after one in the morning because I wanted to know what was going to happen. There were a lot of surprises and lies that build up to the finale of the novel.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
1490313370|5.0|I really don't want a Jewish guy with overgrown hair, a wild intellect that doesn't work the way you'd expect it to, and a healthy disrespect for college to be my role model.  This is because I'm a Jewish guy with overgrown hair (I'm now smart enough to get semi-regular haircuts, GREAT for my dating life), a wild intellect that doesn't work the way you'd expect it to, and a healthy disrespect for college (I'm terrible at Jeopardy, I suspect James is too, which is why he keeps harping on Charlemagne's birth).  Nobody wants their role model/spirit guide to be like them.  Familiarity breeds contempt, that's why it's always the black/native american guy giving the white guy advice.  It even works the other way, in The Mask of Zorro, who do they get to give Antonio Banderas advice?  Anthony Hopkins.<br /><br />But James won me over by being so incredible and so human.  That comes through in his blog and his other books, so I'm not going to talk about that.  This book is one big sales presentation, and it's the best sales presentation ever.  It's better than that amazing sales presentation where you heard \\"an iPod, a cell phone, an internet communications device\\" and your heart started to beat faster.  This is better than that because what James is trying to sell you is you.  And you are the best product ever.  Like any good salesperson, James has anticipated all of the things that stop you from believing in you-and his 45 years on this planet have given him enough experience to dig deep into the dark crevices of the human soul.  The part that eats too much cake.  The part that hates the Kardashians.  The part that read Twilight as soon as the kindle iphone app came out because it wanted to know what all the fuss was about and was too embarrassed to go to a bookstore (an internet communications device!  I can't be the only male who has done this).<br /><br />James' wife Claudia does yoga.  I've been to her blog, and take Castor oil baths to help me recover from workouts once a week.  Yoga is, historically a branch of Tantra.  Tantra is about using the world around you, your material senses and experiences, to achieve spiritual insights.  Through all of your objections, fear, self doubt, procrastination, and pain, this will return you over and over again to become the ocean.  To charge what is infinite and endless in you into something better, something that will reverberate and make a difference in the world.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this guy has done some pretty great stuff.  It's unfortunate, because it's difficult to read these words, live in this world, deal with your tragedies (I have mine, as I'm sure you have yours), and feel dis empowered.  This is a jar full of fireflies that shines brighter every night.nce a week.  Yoga is, historically a branch of Tantra.

0142420891|5.0|I read and quickly fell in love with If I Stay years ago. I never, ever expected a sequel, which made me sad, and when I saw that this book was actually going to exist-not just in my imaginary perfect world-I jumped for joy! I didn't know what to expect, as I refused to read much on it before I actually picked it up, not wanting to raise my expectations to unreachable heights. That turned out to work splendidly for me, as every part of Where She Went was wonderfully different from how I pictured it could be.<br /><br />I was immediately drawn into the storyline, as Adam's and Mia's lives have changed so drastically from the end of the first books. Three years have passed, and they've grown up, each starting to decide what they want to do with the rest of their lives and acting upon it. The pages seemed to fly by, and before I knew it, the book was finished.<br /><br />I love the writing style of this book, full of imagery and great detail. I could really picture everything that was going on, as well as see how Adam was feeling and know exactly why he was feeling that way. The descriptive prose was really touching, and it wasn't in large, daunting paragraphs that are hard to swallow, rather concise sentences.<br /><br />I really loved Where She Went. It was a fantastic book that continues the story and fought its way into my heart. I know that fans of the first book will like this sequel, and newcomers should start with If I Stay, or else risk being completely lost. I give this book 5/5 stars.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|No matter how I felt about the characters in this book, it was not enough to smooth over the disappointment I felt after reading it.  The release date for the final book in this \\"trilogy\\" was pushed back so many times I had finally given up on it.  Then low and behold...she finally -actually released it.  It's much shorter than the two previous books.  I felt that given the limited pages offered up to continue her story- she spent far too much of that precious space repeating scenarios from Bared and Reflected.  We read those books already- how about expanding on the plot not repeating it.<br />Maybe the Crossfire Series didn't rake in as much as FSOG so she needed to squeeze a little more out of us?  Well- sorry, your tactics suck.  Selling me another book for $10 that greatly repeated the previous ones with very little new story content sucks even more. I have to say; sticking it to your loyal readers by letting them know that it's gonna cost yet $20 if they actually want the rest of the story that they naively thought they had already purchased...that is just bad business.<br />I won't mind borrowing the last 2 titles from a friend (if anyone gets it)- but I will not purchase them.
0142418471|5.0|I bought this book a while ago and decided that it was finally the right time to read it! I love John Green (and have been meaning to read more of his books, as otherwise I feel like a bad nerdfighter) and I've read some of David Levithan's work as well, so I figured the two together was nothing short of amazingly awesome.<br /><br />And I was right! Thankfully. I loved the story just from the first few pages. What with Tiny and Will Grayson's hilarious description of his only friend and his life and general, I couldn't get enough. Then I figured out that the other Will Grayson spoke in alternating chapters (which I happened to like reading more, if only because I liked reading it all in lowercase . . . ) because I didn't actually read the back before buying this book. Yes. I have a horrible habit of doing that, but it makes everything more interesting when I know I'll like the writing and have absolutely no expectations whatsoever. Except, you know, for the fact that there'll be two Will Grayson's in there somewhere.<br /><br />I think that everyone, at some point, has wondered what it'd be like to meet someone with the same name. It'd be a completely odd and weird and wonderful experience, because on paper they are you, but if real life they're definitely not. I liked how the novel dealt with that, with all of the characters problems (and they all-even the minor ones-had flaws. Yay! Because I hate it when they're all perfect) and with high school. And that musical. It sure was something.<br /><br />This book took me only a few days to read because it was so completely enjoyable. It made me laugh, gasp, cheer them on, want to throw things. Everything that a book should do and then some. I like it when a hilarious book can also have some really great messages thrown in there. And have amazing plot twists.<br /><br />You should definitely check this book out! Everyone. Go go go!
0062127241|5.0|i remember going to a concert in 2002  and saying to my friend that the two things that make a Who concert great is 1) if Roger gets mad or 2) if Pete starts to pontificate. This is a book of pontification (in a good way). One can't always believe everything he says as fact, but it is always the truth at the time of a great artist.

And it was a great story. Hope, love, horror. But, always lovely.<br /><br />My fave. Just so you know my second, and have a bit of a guage on which to assess my assessment, it was Kiss of Snow (contrary to many so-so reviews).

0062059963|1.0|In The Elite, sequel to The Selection, I was struck once again by the gorgeous cover art. Unfortunately, staring at the cover for several minutes was one of the high points of this novel. To give Cass credit, there is visible improvement between her first novel and this one. The writing is better. There is at least a sense of connection throughout her writing, a marked improvement from The Selection which lacked any connectivity whatsoever. The vocabulary and grammar usage is still childish and awkward, but no longer painfully so. Cass earns points in my book for stylistic improvement. Not major points, but certainly a few.<br /> The plot of The Elite focuses once again on America, a seventeen-year-old girl chosen as one of the possible future queens of fictitious Ilea. The introduction to all Cass's characters having been established in the previous novel allows Cass to move past the mundane in this second installment. Much to my disappointment, the majority of the story was still focused on the America-prince relationship and all the petty jealousies thereof. Yes, this is in spite of the fact that most of this particular plotline had run its course in the first installment and there is very little left to tell. This makes the majority of the story tedious at best; at its worst points, the narrative was downright unbearable.<br /> However, the story does have its moments. The reader learns more about the strange political structure and history of Ilea, which is certainly the best part of the book. As mentioned in my last review, the juxtaposition of American ideals and the restricting caste system of Cass's fictitious country makes for a very intriguing combination ripe with possibilities. These possibilities are unfortunately hampered by the characters themselves, most of whose intellects are such that at times I felt like screaming. Case and point: when America asks her best friend and rival love interest about why people might want to steal books from the palace, he suggests that they're using them as kindling. Completely seriously. And America takes this as a very viable suggestion. Really? Come on. The sheer stupidity of the characters makes any kind of complex plot structure impossible. This is necessarily very frustrating as a reader, especially with the massive potential that is Cass's political setup.<br /> Overall, I'm definitely not crazy about it. The Elite is better than its predecessor, but the poor writing, frustrating characters, and petty plotline are serious weights in the con column. Cass does get points for her unique setting and for some stylistic improvements. If you read the first in the series, go ahead and read this one, too. If you haven't, take a pass at something a little more worthwhile.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I couldn't wait to get this book, but was so disappointed at the ending. It seemed unfinished, like she had a deadline and just couldn't finish in time. I do like the way the characters have come along and love the trust between them, but just can't get over the ending.

B009GFEOY8|4.0|It took a couple experimental shots, but this film really does work.  The colors aren't as bright and vivid as the original film.  A bit more faded and on the sepia side even.  However, if you enjoy that type of aesthetic you will end up with beautiful shots with this fully functional film.  Just make sure that as soon as you take the picture you put the polaroid into a dark area (your bag, a drawer, etc.) immediately.  Turns out overexposed if you don't.  This may be an obvious point for some users, but I had always thought that polaroids didn't need to get hidden away after the shot was taken.  With the Impossible Project film, it appears that it does - at the very least, it helped with my shots.  All in all, well worth the purchase; I'm on my third pack now!

0446401307|1.0|Having read and enjoyed previous Harry Bosch books I was amazed at our poor this book is.  As stated in previous reviews the book is very short, the writing is incredibly basic, the characters are very shallow and the main story very weak.  I would be embarrassed if I was Michael Connelly for producing this book and if I was reading it as my first Harry Bosch book I would certainly not buy another one.  It really seems like a student of Michael's has written this.

B008S80OU2|5.0|The Blue Oyster Cult Box set, reprising all albums up to &#34;Heaven Forbid&#34;, is worth the price of admission for the DVD alone. The grainy but memorable concert footage was an interesting flashback to the halcyon days when the band was a top seller and was performing and selling out in the huge arena settings. The down-loads of the early 70's concerts was also a great plus if not a great purchase on their own. I hadn't thought of the King Biscuit Flour Hour in years. If you have vinyl that's been played to death as mine have this it the treat you've been waiting for. Enjoy
1594204217|3.0|I first read him in \\"Botany of Desire\\".  It's a book I've reread.  In \\"Cooked\\" he covers a vast territory and while maintaining an overall scheme still manages to dig down and present nuggets you come upon almost by surprise.  The overall surprise for me though is his apparent assumption that many if not most people don't cook their own food.  I am not a culinary genius nor even that adventurous but all my life I have liked trying new things both the cooking and the eating of them.  In this regard I found \\"Cooked\\" a very satisfying book though I suspect it might be less so for either an expert cook or for the person who doesn't expect to ever have to cook their own food.
0763644765|5.0|This book is the bomb. My son picks it up and looks through it every single night, and I literally laughed out loud the first couple times I read it.<br /><br />He obviously can't read yet, but he acts out what's going on on each page. Ie, he gets worried when the baby has to go potty but doesn't know what to do - says \\"mmm ooo\\" on the page where he's saying that, yawns on the sleepy page and claps on the happy page. I love that the baby is gender neutral so you can read it with a boy or a girl. My son also already knows what to do on the potty, at 16 months. He sits on it before bed and in the AM and almost always does some business there (I think that's a combination of reading this book with him and being at daycare with older kids).<br /><br />Bottom line, this book is very kid-appropriate, and funny for adults too.

0375507256|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I started reading this book.  After a few pages I found myself mesmerized by a true rarity these days...someone who actually knows how to use words to build a mental picture, a personality, a setting!  In this age of four letter words and junior high level plots, it is refreshing to immerse one’s self in not one, not two, not even three different worlds but more and have each as separate and engaging as the first.  The plot lines are intriguing traversing time and space, each intertwining becoming an integral part of the next:  Mr. Ewing suffering a long sea journey being &#34;assisted&#34; by the diabolical doctor and ultimately saved by a runaway slave.  Mr. Cavendish and his hilarious and heroic exploits at the &#34;prison for aging citizens.&#34;  The enlightened &#34;fabricant&#34; Sonmi-451 who proves that a mind thirsting for knowledge can rise above artificial genetic engineering to become a free thinking martyr. The story of Zachry and  Meronym…the list goes on.  This book is a treat for the mind.  It is very well written with a huge cast of individual but recognizable characters.  Yes, I have seen the movie and was intrigued by it.  It was also very well done but only scratched the surface of what is Cloud Atlas.  It was like the appetizer setting the stage for a full banquet!  Enjoy!

0425263924|3.0|Hot sex but the story was a let down. A few great moments but dragged on. Would have liked to have learned more about Gideon's past. Missed opportunity.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I found myself laughing out loud at times and when I was reading I had the voice of Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory in my head.  Would highly recommend this book.
B008476HBM|5.0|I loved this story. I liked the characters. I love the romance part of the plot of the story. I would recommend it.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|Finding Pride by Jill Sanders is a wonderful romance. It warms the heart. Follow Megan as she buries her brother, escapes an abusive husband and begins a new life in the small town of Pride. The flawlessness and complexity of the characters makes them seem all too real. This is an amazing story of overcoming personal tragedy and an abusive relationship to find that life gives second chances. Megan is a strong and lovable character. All of the characters in this book are very well developed and the story is brilliantly crafted. I highly recommend this book; I give it a 5 out of 5 stars.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I was surprised when I started reading this book Didn't realize it has such detail to it. It keep me interested to see what was going to happen next.

B000Y7U98W|1.0|Because of Trainspotting (which I admit was a great film) Danny Boyle has gotten funding time and time again to make a series of bad moves that keep getting worse.  The Beach started out ok, then goes off the deep end and looses all sense halfway through.  28 Days later was just plain stupid, and then Sunshine came out, which is even stupider.  I won't go into great detail, as I have wasted enough time on this film already, but I will say this:  Obviously, he was trying to make a mash-up of 2001 A Space Odyssey crossed with Aliens with a little Event Horizon mixed in.  Seriously, watch those three films, and you will see Boyle does nothing but bite these films in an unflattering and totally obvious way.  His films are consistently gimmicky and poorly thought out.  There is very little, if any, Science in this so called Science Fiction film.  Character development in this film is weak, and the plot is just plain idiotic.  Easily one of the worst movies I have sat through in a long, long time.  I have no idea how this film gets the positive ratings it gets...but then again, people like to be spoon fed Michael Bay's trash too, so go figure.
B007THA4FI|2.0|It was an interesting book not at all what I expected. It was 500 plus pages. It took awhile to get. Into it. So many characters to try and keep up with.  It easily could have been two books.  Very graphic language. I found that distracting.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I was overwhelmed at first of the mixed reviews I have read on this book.  I loved the first two books and I did not waste time to pre-order the third “installment”.  I was keeping in touch with the story by way of Sylvia Day’s website, and yes, that shows how eager I am to get hold of EWY.  I learned of EWY not being the last book of Angel and Ace’s story thru that website.  I am therefore, not surprised to learn that there will be more.  Though I must share, that some reviews were really true, as I myself have some qualms on where Eva and Gideon’s story is heading after all.<br /><br />I would like to start of that I love and hate both Eva and Gideon on their disputed immaturity.  I have loved how Eva has grown up by not dashing away the minute there is a threat to her comfort zones.  Instead she has learned to collide head on with those threats and be able to learn lessons piece by piece on how to understand Gideon more.  I applaud how she managed to stay afloat and sane with all the trust issues going around her, both with Gideon and her family.  However, I also detest how she acts so naïve when it comes to Gideon.  She can read what her mom, Cary, Brett, and dad’s intentions are a mile away.  But how could she let Gideon be manipulated by those women.<br /><br />I loved how Gideon was the one who wants to settle down and I couldn’t agree more with his reasons.  As Eva believed Cary is her anchor, I believed Gideon thinks of her that way too.  This time around Gideon selflessly gives the love that Eva yearns for.  He openly says the word as well.  It may be growing on him.  Probably because Eva says it more and more in this book, which sometimes made me think, she is just saying it for loss of words and missing the meaning of it altogether.  The sad part on Gideon, as a very manipulative and powerful person, he always succumbs to Corinne’s scheming works.  To make it look worse, he always leaves Eva when doing that.  As Eva told Angus, “I should have married you instead of your boss”.  Angus was always there to catch Eva whenever Gideon feels the “need” to toss Eva out of his unfortunate circumstances.  Although I agree with Gideon's reasons for wanting to get married, understand as well Eva's apprehensions with all those unanswered and unresolved complications in their lives.  How can you marry a guy, who cannot sleep beside you?  Who tosses you out at the first cry of his ex-es?<br /><br />Nevertheless, I will be waiting for the next book of Eva and Gideon.  I got hooked with their story and don’t mind the additional nuisance adversaries to keep the love and bind between them stronger.  I just hope there will be less sex moments between the two just to prove that they are growing to love each other more.  I hope the next book will focus on a more mature and responsible Eva and Gideon willing to share all their dark secrets with each other and being able to triumph over them together without getting too much under the sheets... or on the couch... or in a limousine.

B005ZCXPP0|5.0|This was fun to watch and now I want to find out what happens next with the Avengers. I would recommend this movie for good family entertainment.
B0017U7PT6|4.0|I honestly do not understand the hatred surrounding Roland Emmerich's 10,000 BC, as it is a very entertaining and well-made adventure movie that takes us back in time to a world of discovery, superstition, and an epic quest for survival and love. I don't know if I was the only one to pick up on this, but the action in this movie was very similar to that of Avatar, which I seem to notice every day as the most un-original film ever made. 10,000 B.C., while its script may not have been award-worthy or truly memorable, the visuals, action sequences and awesome scale were enough. Roland has always delivered when it comes to disaster films, as he is the master (ID4, Day After Tomorrow and 2012), but he also has his more subtle and very memorable films as well, for being different (The Patriot and Anonymous), even if they didn't have a liking by everyone. But it's 10,000 B.C. that is his most interesting film because, well, it was successful, and different. We can speculate and determine some specifics of what life was before the death of Christ, before the building of the Pyramids, but after the Cavemen left their caves, but we don't know much, and his vision of this truly lost world is very incredible. Of every blockbuster released in the past decade, this was among the best half, honestly. Not even half of Michael Bay's films are as good as 10,000 B.C., specifically the Bad Boys movies, Transformers sequels and The Island.<br /><br />All-in-all, when counting in the great visuals, superb musical score and good directing with the decent script and alright acting, 10,000 B.C. is a good, entertaining movie that's ultimately an underrated gem. It's not for everyone, but it is a good movie
B0037QGRZG|4.0|I got this as part of a retro movie night set for another's Day she loved it - At first I had considered getting all the regular versions of the movies but now I'm glad I got a blu-ray. It looks much better on the projector.

B007T7MIR0|1.0|Majorly sucks .doesn't do a damn thing.<br />Gave it 1 star, because you have to, in order to write a review. Just doesn't do anything, bit ask for more $$$ for the promise of doing something.

From ''Time To Pretend'' to ''Kids''  to the end song ''Future Reflections'' it keep me on my toes. Awesome Album. I listened to this by the ocean in florida with the sunset. Surreal Experience man.
B00D2K40WY|3.0|It is good game! The one thing I do not think is good is you have<br />to pay for the full version. If you do not know if you should get it or not<br />I would try it! I think the age limit is for GIRLS 9 &amp; older! Some o the dresses are<br />are very bad
1451695195|5.0|I thought it was an excellent book.  Some parts of it were a little &#34;deep&#34; for me on the medical end of it, but he had a novel way of describing his experience!
B009R659L8|4.0|Anything by Mary Higgins clark is phenomenal!!  I recommend this book to any one who loves mystery!!  A must read!
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|When you get right down to it, Altucher isn't saying much that differs from ancient advice on the life well-lived. But he's presenting it at a time when a reminder is desperately needed by those for whom the wisdom of the ancients has been drowned out, and he's presenting it in a voice that engages us without condescension. Read this book for the help it can give you in leading a more real and courageous life, read it for the laughs, or read it for the jolt you need to get out of your rut. Just read it already.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I am very disappointed with this book (and it looks like I am not alone on this). I found the ending very insignificant!  There were so many loose ends.....I read the book on my Kindle.  When I got to the final chapter I realized that there was no way that this story would be ending in this book!  Another point that has not been addressed....why does this series run parallel with that of another author????? Anyway,  I will not be purchasing any more of this series.!
B005FMB8X6|5.0|There are plenty of reviews of the \\"Discipline\\" album and have been for many years, so I won't go over that again here.  What I will do is review the 5.1 surround content and the actual \\"sound\\" of this jewel.<br /><br />All of the tunes sound GREAT in 5.1 and the mixing is VERY well done.  King Crimson isn't a band that uses too many electronic effects that really lend themselves to panning around all of the speakers like, say, a Floyd album might, but the 5.1 still does this album justice.<br /><br />The sound is \\"usually\\" laid out as follows...<br /><br />Drums and bass (mostly) come out of the mains.  Fripp's guitar is panned to the rear and Belew's is up front.  Belew's vocals come out of the center speaker, while the other vocal part (usually the harmony) comes from any of the other speakers.  Sometimes it's the mains.  Sometimes the harmony is on the mains and the rears.  It's ALWAYS done to nice effect and the mix is CLEAN.  I can crank it to around -10 DB on my system, which is as far as I'll dare go and there is absolutely ZERO hiss or noise - only the sweet sounds of KC doing their best (IMHO) album EVER.<br /><br />If something happened to my copy of this DVD, I'd buy it again without a second thought.  The CD that comes with it is well done also.<br /><br />One thing I forgot to note - It's not mastered loudly.  There's plenty of headroom.  If you want it cranked, you certainly have that option, but the mastering engineer leaves it up to you.  5 stars...
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|That was great but i can't believe i have to wait for more. I waited so long for this one i had to reread them. That sucks i guess I'll have to read them all again but in all honesty im glad it's not over i love Eva,Gideon, Cary and all the other characters so keep writing Sylvia but hurry lol.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|A different kind of ani movie. Very well done. Story a bit weak, but I enjoyed it. Something for everyone ok for pre-teens and above
0307700879|3.0|This was a fascinating story of how four lost souls, who had suffered from the war, managed to come together.  Their lives intersect in an old villa in war-torn Italy.  Here Hana, who has been beat down, both emotionally and mentally, brings her anonymous and unknown English patient.  Caravaggio finds his way to the villa, who has also suffered wounds from the war.  Then Kip, the Indian sapper camps out and will slowly join their group.  Each is consumed with a private misery and dark secrets.  Before long they discover their past life has been intertwined with the others.<br /><br />In some ways this was a hard book to read.  The author describes things with words which I have almost never seen used.  Such as \\"the heart is an organ of fire.\\"  Also describing the desert as a \\"palace of wind.\\"  The characters are well developed with the author showing their background, the war-time experiences and how they managed to come together at the villa in Italy.  Maybe because this book is about something which I obviously cannot relate to, it may be more difficult to understand.  Hana has suffered greatly watching so many men die, she is afraid of personal committment and getting involved in a relationship.  Caravaggio too has war wounds and lost his sense of trust.  He would rather just shoot up on morphine, than have to face up to life.  Kip too has suffered from losing his mentor, Lord Suffolk and his secretary, who showed him a close friendship and camaraderie, which he had never experienced before with English people.  Then of course, Count Almasy has many secrets and a hidden past, which he will disclose in the book.  The story is fascinating, but having first watched the movie, may create expectations for the characters, which are not going to be the same.  Otherwise I would recommend this book for something different.  The author has a writing style all his own.  That makes this a very original novel, like no other.
B0034G4P26|5.0|The folks at Aarman studios never fail to deliver!  This is a great film that shows what great effort was put into making it.  The Blu-Ray really makes the animation look amazing!

B009MFKO3M|3.0|I loved Tame Impala's first album.  But this album didn't seem to strike a chord with me.  I was a little dissapointed for sure.  Still a great band, but I just wasn't sure about this one.
B00D2CYU2W|3.0|I was not all impressed with this movie.  Though the acting was superb by both Michael Douglas and Matt Damon, it just seemed boring and going nowhere.  The director and production staff seem to focus on the setting and having enough glamour and glitz to go around.  Of course that was what Liberace was all about.  Still I felt there was no real story to all of this.  First the meeting between the 2 men, then all of a sudden they are in a bedroom scene and then they are going for plastic surgery.  This movie just jumps around, with no continuity.  Also Damon did not come across as a young man with his wrinkles and all.  I felt that Douglas did a great job both on and off the stage as Liberace.  He was very convincing.  I could do without all the sexual scenes and reference to acts which I know homosexuals do.  Must we be bombarded constantly with gross behavior and language.  Maybe I am asking for the stars, but I am tired of watching movies which always focus on sex.  I am surely in the minority, as that is probably why most people go to see this kind of movie.
B000RGSOQY|5.0|Marry Me is an awesome album.  It's a wonderful debut from an artist who keeps getting better with each new album.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I dont write reviews but wrote this one because of all the bad ones, I almost didnt buy the book. I would say read the book and make your own conclusions. I liked it and didnt think it was a waste of money. Im fine with going on with the story.....will buy the next one whenever it comes.
B00CL50LEC|5.0|Surprisingly warm and engrossing love story.  The movie takes the grand theme of love conquers all into the zombie zeitgeist.  I am not a zombie fan, but I loved this movie.  The sound track is absolutely outstanding and really adds to the movie. Any movie than can move a 45 year old man and his 15 year old daughter is an instant classic.
141659521X|5.0|As always Vince Flynn does not disappoint. Mitch Rapp takes you  on whirlwind adventure full of twists and intrigue. I love this author and his characters and cant wait for the next one.
B00BYISQTO|5.0|This band always delivers.  Although it is different from their previous works, this still carries the sound that The National fans have grown to love.  It does feel, a bit more somber though.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|The movie is witty and charming with clever humor.<br />The music is terrific. This is my 12 year old's favorite movie.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The same words are repeated over and over to describe sexual interludes. Also to repeat the same words over and over to describe sex, which E.L. James does, becomes unforgivable. Anastasia's lip biting and Grey's consistent passion in response to this and his \\"hooded eyes\\" is were two of my biggest complaints. I'd handcuff and whip James with a feather if I could for this. If you have the same meal daily it can become boring. Nothing changes and even their kinky sex stays the same. Grey puts on his jeans and ties her up and she whimpers or loves it. The nipple pulling and elongation is a nice touch however and I think maybe a lot of people may be very repressed and need some instruction and this book and her previous two would work well to loosen up people who don't have much sexual expertise and who are very repressed. I had written some sex scenes sometime ago and had given them to a professor. He promised to read and share with his agent. He was known for this at my school. They were written as part of a larger story and part of a novel. Some time later I saw his new novel had some of my language in it.<br /><br />The point is that I thought, Oh my, E.L. James got hold of my sex scene because the nipple pulling and elongation were the words I had used referencing that with the nipple pulling causing twinges from the uterus. I still have this stuff on my computer with the original dates too. Either neither of us is that creative or we know similar things. I'll go with the latter because how likely is it that she knew the same professor I knew or perhaps she was in the class? Who knows?<br /><br />I got through the first two books quickly and think the first was the best. I do believe more character building is in order for all three books. I especially disliked the third book where in the climax (forgive the pun) James switches the POV (point of view) without ever having done so in any of the other books and up till this point, not in this book either. Suddenly we are in Grey's mind and seeing through his eyes. The problem is that we already know all this stuff through Anastasia's eyes and giving us his POV is just to make James' work easier so she no longer has to create anything new. I also take issue with the blank pages, for example, not James's words, but she'll put the sentence, Mommy was a junkie and then there are two blank pages following or Domination gave me control over my world and then another two blank pages. The third book was especially problematic because half way through she has becomes pregnant with her little \\"blip\\" and then within the next fifty pages she's expecting her third child.<br /><br />I did like the mystery scenes and chase scenes. The whole premise of rich boy - poor girl gets the world from rich boy, is a bit overdone and is clich&eacute;' although maybe James feels she is reaching for \\"every girl's dream.\\"are in Grey's mind and seeing through his eyes.

0345495004|1.0|I mistakenly thought this book was about Frank Lloyd Wright's personal history and what was behind his great design. I had no idea that it was a fictional account of his &#34;affairs&#34; which offended me!  I would NEVER recommend this book to anyone!!  Actually threw it away for the filth it was!
B00AEFYX4U|5.0|I loved Rango and could not pass up this deal when I saw that the Blu-Ray was being sold for under $10.  It felt like a steal at that price.

B006XF5BTG|5.0|I have always read a lot of books for training and felt at some point disappointed and unmotivated because there is so much information that one doesn’t know which one is correct and also sometime they contradict each other.<br /><br />Finally, I found this book in amazon and started to read it.  What really got my interest at first was how the author explains that He has trained for a long time and that he has experienced for himself a lot of training and diet plans; therefore he has the knowledge necessary to help anyone in this area.<br /><br />I have been using the diet and training plan from the book for 3 months and I already can see the difference.<br /><br />I have to say I am really happy with the results.<br /><br />I recommend this book for anyone who wants to train, it really works.
B0089LOG02|5.0|When I started this book, I couldn't put it down until I finished it. Vivian & Molly&#34;s parallel lives were very interesting. I liked the feel-good ending also.

B0015346OM|5.0|This is easily one of the best military books written in a long time.  Bowden goes above and beyond in this book, giving insight into an insane battle by interviewing people on both sides.  What a read!  I HIGHLY recommend this book, especially if you're a fan of the movie.

B00CL68BK2|4.0|Did not know if I would like it, but it turned out to be enjoyable.  Worth renting for a night.
B00BEXB18M|4.0|I'm 37 which puts me in the age range most of you reading this probably are.  I really like Megadeth a lot with some serious love towards certain albums but, let's face it, they flip flop from trying to appeal to two different groups of fans (the thrash purists that insist upon a spiritual successor to Rust In Peace and those that actually dig the tunes with vocal melodies).<br /><br />Count me in the latter group.  Of course I loved the Marty/Menza years but have felt that their post-Menza/Friedman era albums have tried too hard to impress the thrash purists (with exception to the phenomenal The System Has Failed which was a Mustaine solo album re-branded Megadeth at the last minute when he reactivated the band after a short hiatus).<br /><br />Is the title of Supercollider hokey?  Yes.  Are the lyrics to the title track hokey?  Yep.  Is it catchy?  Yes it is.  It's fun in the same vein as \\"Crush 'Em\\" was off of Risk which I actually liked (I can't fault Dave for trying something different to see what happens) (Devin Townsend pulls it off every album and he's generally praised for it).<br /><br />Are there actual heavy tracks on the album or is it radio friendly?  There's a bit of everything on here.  I bought the Best Buy version with 14 tracks (2 bonus and Countdown live).  I'm really happy with this album.  I still like The System Has Failed best but this one is growing on me fast.<br /><br />I'm giving it 4 stars because it fits in the same writing style we saw on Youthanasia, Cryptic Writings and The System Has Failed.  If you dug those you'll find this one a fitting complement.  There are a couple of tracks that just piddle around doing diddly squat (Burn, Off The Edge) but even those albums have some tracks that feel like filler.<br /><br />Highly recommended unless you can't appreciate melody.

1476734941|5.0|Whether weight loss is the main goal or simply a by product of attaining a healthier life style this is a pretty easy way to achieve either.  Once you have tried the 2 day out of 7 fast for a couple of weeks, you find yourself more conscious of calories everyday and even eating fewer out of habit.  Even if you simply cut or eliminate sugar you will see a change.  It is worth a try and I recommend that you keep busy and away from the temptation of food on the fasting days.  Also, drinking a lot of unsweetened green or herbal teas on those days works for me.
B00BGIC4I6|4.0|Love all the cameos.  We enjoyed this movie.  Quite funny.  Worth renting.  Spend the few bucks for it, you won't be disappointed.

B00CL68NOG|4.0|Funny and entertaining with a sweet message for mothers and sons.  A very mild PG-13.  We saw it with our children (ages 11 and 13) and thought it should have been rated PG (not PG-13).
B00CL68NOG|3.0|Worth renting I guess.  Spent the money on it only to find it for free on the plane ride home the day.  Not happy about that.

Im not prone to change favorites but I this book may change that.<br /><br />There is nothing I can say that hasn't already been said over 100 times here.<br />Bravo!

014017821X|5.0|More vivid, real, and confronting tales you won't find. Angela Carter sure can create lasting images for a reader.<br /><br />Whether you want the images contained in this book stuck in your head for all eternity - that is a different question.<br /><br />Woman and beasts are the themes of this work, and Carter explores several angles including, woman as, with, saving, slaying and being rescued from foul and fair creatures.<br /><br />Ultimately really cool (but not for kids)
1623420148|5.0|An amazing book - I read it fast and enjoyed every minute.<br /><br />For some reason Drew reminded me of Tony  in the NCIS TV series. They seem very similar (in a very good way!)<br />This was a refreshing male viewpoint of a romance done superbly. Writing mostly in the present tense and in the personal narrative form is hard to do and pull off. Kudos to Ms. Chase for doing it so well.  It's very clever how she pulls you into the story as if Drew is telling this just to you, gauging your reactions and calling you on them - absolutely brilliant!<br /><br />Ms Chase will have a very long line waiting for her next novel to be published - and I will be in it!<br />Thank you Emma Chase for a great read.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A literary piece you will remember for a very long time.  I read it weeks ago and it remains so fresh in my mind & heart!  I was sorry to read THE END!  Please screenwriter out there make this a movie!  Cannot wait to read more of Ms. McKenna's works.

0670026638|4.0|I couldn't really say enough in praise of this extraordinary vision of time and its folding relationship between past and present, but I will admit that a restaurant (as described) that works hard to \\"refine the palettes of their Campbell River neighbors\\" is one that's more familiar with the art of painting than the art of food. Does the copy editor not know the difference between \\"palette\\" and \\"palate\\"?<br /><br />And while the tech guys and gals are extremely clever to engineer a jump to a footnote that's almost automatic (cursor up to the line with the footnote and it usually lands Right On the Footnote rather than at the head or foot of the line - remarkable!), why are the Roman renderings of kanji (Japanese) characters 1/4 the size of the main text and, if a letter with a diacritical mark is included (for example, the ä in Obachama - except the \\"a\\" should have a straight line above it rather than an umlaut - it doesn't seem to exist in my letter sets), that letter is 1/4 the size of the other letters in the word. That's consistent in the text and in the footnotes. Bummer!<br /><br />I tried increasing the size of the text, but the weird smaller-sized lettering persisted no matter the general text size.<br /><br />Still, I'm not giving up on this free-flowing representation of a teenage Japanese girl with a suicidal father (at times herself suicidal, but not really) who's writing about her experiences in a down economy - at least for her family - and the writer on the coast of Canada who's found the teen's diary in a zip-lock bag on the shore, an apparent piece of flotsam after the earthquake and tsunami in Japan.<br /><br />The \\"palette\\" vs. \\"palate\\" question would usually be enough for me to immediately say \\"Feh!\\" and return the book for credit, but I'm giving this one more of a chance.
0156027321|1.0|I cannot believe how many people are calling this a faith-affirming story!!<br /><br />In a nutshell, the story begins with a boy who is confused about three different religions.  He questions the validity of Christianity saying God does not make any sense sending His son to suffer for us.  The story moves along with the boy appearing to become more faithful.<br /><br />In the very end however, the boy is clear when he asks which story you prefer, and then basically insinuates God is about a good story, and not truth.<br /><br />The author wrote this story rather cleverly to confuse adults and children, but make no mistake this story was not to reaffirm faith, rather, the idea that we believe in good stories.  Soooo disappointing. Just a waste of time and money to watch this movie if you're a Christian.

B004LWZVZC|5.0|What a Great movie! James McAvoy had a very hard job as the defense attorney, but his acting was superb! Robin Wright also did a superb job! The movie was sad, but so very good.  So glad I have this to add to my collection!!<br /><br />Rhonda

B001QWBM62|5.0|This thing is awesome. The sound quality is great and it's pretty easy to use. Don't skimp out on sound quality it's more important then the video!!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I laughed out loud many times and snorted twice… she is as talented a comedic writer as any of her other callings. JFTR- I will be quoting .
B004A8ZYZE|5.0|I got a lot of good ideas that I'm already using (and evangelizing). A great follow up to his previous books. Well worth the read.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I downloaded this game onto my Kindle Fire. Works well for me and is a good game for Solitaire fans in my opinion.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was looking for a good Post Apoc book/series when I ran into Wool. It first grabbed me because of the ambiguous title. Wool? But there were so many positive reviews that I had to give it a shot (and because of it being an indie author...although I don't think you could classify Hugh that way now)<br /><br />The book opens with lots of description. Not of what I anticipated; the what/where/why but more of the who. We learn of the characters and the very picturesque setting but the real story unfolds a few chapters in. Because of the unusual setting, it's hard not to have a hundred questions as the place is described. Why didn't they do this? Why did they do that? How does that work? But you really have to relax and let the story be told. Again, because of such an original piece I was more than willing to.<br /><br />What I thought was going to be a world driven piece ended up being a well balanced character AND world piece. It is as fantastic as the awards and reviews say it is. Really a must read whether you like post apoc or not.<br /><br />I already know this will be one of those books in 5 years that I won't recall whether I read it as a book or saw the movie....and that's a great thing! That's how real the world became.
159514188X|2.0|Luckily, I borrowed/downloaded this for free from my public library and read it on my Kindle.  The unique dual narrator format of this novel was compelling and original.  I was hooked from the beginning but by the third \\"tape\\", I started to get rather annoyed.  I just couldn't get over the fact that Hannah's character was downright annoying.  As a middle school teacher, I've met plenty of students like her.  In fact, when I was in middle school myself, I often found myself thinking: \\"I should just kill myself\\" like Hannah did-- for pretty trivial reasons.  I think many (especially female) teenagers probably have thought this at least once in their lives.  Most are not serious about it.  Those that are-- unfortunately, their \\"reasons\\" are usually much deeper and are so much more tragic than Hannah's.  This is probably what bothered me most.  Yes, she was whiny and snarky, but that could have been overlooked if we could've experienced her story in a different way.  The very fact that she orchestrated revenge tapes, however, cause me to lose so much sympathy for her.  As a middle school teacher, I've unfortunately, experienced many teens who are depressed and write to me about wanting to end their lives.  And these are serious threats, ones that prompt swift calls to parents, guidance counselors and/or children's services.  All of these teens, however, have experienced such severe trauma, some adults wouldn't have been able to handle it much less someone at the age of 13.  Kids who have experience emotional or physical abuse, been homeless, watched a loved one die tragically.  The lists goes on, and the reasons are incredibly sad.  I hate it when I see first hand how cruel the world can be for some children.  This is probably why I couldn't stand Hannah.  Her life, while not perfect, would look like a cake walk to some of my troubled students.  (She did seem to be ignored by her parents, and yet her parents weren't her top two reasons?  Huh?)  Yet, in over ten years ofteaching, I-- FORTUNATELY-- have never had a student commit suicide.  I feel like the idea of Hannah is a slap in the face to my students who have had to overcome real pain and struggle and yet soldier on despite these issues.  Both my father and my grandmother were alcoholics who killed themselves.  I grew up knowing that suicide is one of the most selfish acts you can commit, in most cases.  I have read other, one or two star reviews, of people who have also experienced suicide of a loved one or thought of suicide themselves.  I don't think this is a coincidence.  I skimmed through so many of the five and four star reviews, and I couldn't find one where someone had first hand experience with losing someone to suicide.  I imagine, if they did, that they too would find that this novel almost mocks it.  I don't think the author intended to make light of a serious topic.  And I know many teenagers and adults were compelled to read this novel and loved it.  I just hate that this piece of \\"realistic fiction\\" seems too far from reality.  Real teenagers in cities across our country cope with MAJOR life problems, some better than others.  Hannah is just the WRONG character to spread any kind of message.  Please read responsibly.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I loved the Oregon Trail game itself but from the beginning had troubles the app mechanics. For instance I had about 10-15 friends but couldn't get to their neighborhoods to collect work hearts. Wasn't able to sign in using either facebook or the game site itself. All of that was frustrating but the final straw was when the game kicked me back to the beginning for the third time. Each time I had reached a high level in the game and had a lot of time invested.<br />So, since I can't count on the game to pick up where I left off at any given moment, I am quitting the game and deleting it from my kindle altogether.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Exactly what I wanted.  Bought for my daughter but wish I got it for myself instead!  Great color.  A must have for the less than graceful iPhone users like myself and my daughter.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Really enjoyed this one.  Kept me interested and wanting to find out what was going to happen next.  Very good characters.  I have read several Harry Bosch series and just really enjoy them.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I love this book. It was my first novel that i have ever read. I recommend this series to any child looking for a great read.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I gave this a high rating because I've read this book in softcover and have it in softcover - my purchase was more because I wanted to include it in my eBooks library and because I am a avid reader - a friend turned me on to this trilogy and I am very thankful that she did
B004TI5N38|4.0|I think I have read just about all of his books.  He really writes well and keeps you entertained.  Again, I had my husband read this one, too.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|This was an awesome movie. I'm very glad that I bought it will be going to see the next movie for sure.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love it because it can be played alone!  I don't have to reach a score before I stop.  It is intertaining!
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|jurassic park is a good game and I thought there was nothing like it but I've downloaded the 129.0 Mb thing like OVER 5 times!but is still good though =)
0321544080|5.0|Very good read here. Written in a fun and succinct manner. Very good insight into McNally's process for enthusiasts and pro's alike.<br /><br />Doesn't get tedious, just gets straight to the point.<br /><br />Those new to photography might want to keep this on their reading list for later... Or if you buy now just don't expect the typical tutorial/guide like format. But once you're well into photography you'll really appreciate this book.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love it because I can keep up with friends and family.  See what they are doing, share what I am doing1  Find new things to do!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have all 3 versions of this computer xbox and this 1 when I made my first world I said:holy crap its beautiful.my friend has the update with spawn eggs and talking and buckets of things but I don't have that for some reason!!! love this game &gt;=D
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I love Gideon Cross and absolutely do NOT mind that we are getting another 2 books to this series.  If you love Gideon and Eva, then you'll enjoy this book, a continuation of their story.  Was it my favorite, no!  But I liked watching not only their relationship grow, but also how they have personally evolved.  Eva has grown up a bit in this book.  She's not the overly jealous/whiney girl and finally believes Gideon loves her.  Although, not much drama/angst happens in this book, I do believe it starts setting up big things for the rest of the series.  I personally can't wait for the next book to come out and if Sylvia Day wants to write another 10 more books about Gideon I'd gladly read them.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I started playing this game on Facebook! I was so happy wen it came to Kindle! I play it every day on my kindle Fire! I enjoy trying to beat my Facebook friends without having to sign on the computer!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is really cool I love it I wish it would load a little faster though but its worth the wait!!
0385535147|4.0|John Grisham has written another best-seller.  While it is no \\"The Firm\\" or \\"The Pelican Brief\\", Grisham has put the pen to paper to produce what we have long come to expect - a first rate novel.  There is little doubt that Grisham is the \\"king of the legal thriller.\\"<br />This is a somewhat different path for Grisham.  By his own admission, research is light for this book and, thus, paragraphs are longer.  This does distract from the book slightly however, it does not distract from the story that much.  \\"The Racketeer\\" is definitely a very good read and it is very hard to put down.  Moreover, it is one of those books that always keep you guessing, and it is hard to figure so good luck on that one.  How do we know who the murderer is?<br />Malcolm Bannister is a small-time lawyer for a small-time law firm.  Their firm does not have a high cash flow with an excess of billable hours.  Malcolm stumbles across a real estate deal that seems to all officers of the firm like a fine opportunity.  This changes over time and Malcolm is out of his territory.  He gets snagged by the FBI on a sting of the whole bunch and he gets the maximum of ten years, which is the largest sentence handed down with the exception of the main culprit.  Malcolm is bitter.<br />Malcolm is an ideal prisoner and lands a job in the prison library.  He also does a little jail-house lawyering.  And, he does a lot of research.<br />Malcolm works out a way to get out of prison using Rule 35 (sorry, I can't give any details here).  He has to convince the FBI of his story, though.  Needless to say, he does convince the FBI, and the story takes off from here.<br />If one is a Grisham fan, they will have to read this book.  If one is not an avid Grisham fan, they will want to read this book.  This is the first Grisham book that I have read in a while and it was well worth the read.  It's not the best book in the world, but it is probably one of the better thriller books out there right now.  Let's give him 4-stars for this one.<br /><br />Cam
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I have used this app for early a year, and it takes care of me every morning whether I like it or not!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|there is an update for ios.why don't they have it for any other tablet. even the aneroid users get it

B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app makes it easy to access my facebook account. I is easy to use and I would recommend this app.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|The makers of the Quell series have done it once again...a gaming masterpiece. Some really refreshing twists while keeping the feel of the game familiar.
B0047T70VW|3.0|The author has created a very interesting environment but some of his characterisations just don't ring true. For a post modern world some of his characters use language and have cultural traits going back to the 1920s (e.g Malay Chinese having multiple wives). Perhaps it's the steam punk style? Regardless the majority of characters are not that likeable.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|It provides good information such as percentage of battery life remaining and time remaing in hours. I would recommend this app
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Very surprised how fun this game is for a free game. Reminds me of excite bike from Nintendo<br />. Hours of entertainment.
B000FC13MM|5.0|This is one of those books I got when I was 11, loved passionately, and never stopped loving. Read it.
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|This app did not give instructions on how to play the game. It is not intuitive to figure out. I would not recommend this app
B008Y6YIXM|5.0|Love this movie! Unfortunately I had to buy it to watch it tho... Was very pissed off that Amazoon, Netflix, and others did not offer it as a rental. Pretty stupid! Therefore I had to buy it to watch it. The movie was worth it as it's far better than most BS at theaters these days, but should be able to rent it!!!
B000FC12L4|5.0|This book is more than compelling. The world is dense. It is intricate and mesmerizing. Lirael is the heroine every little girl should meet.
B004WR125O|2.0|The UWF-1 seems to hang and stops working.  It gives you a connection error and requires a restart.  It only works for a short period of time then repeats the whole thing again.  I finally decided to buy the TP Link TL-WN722N High Gain Wireless Adapter after searching internet for comments.  So far it has been superior in performance and has a lower price.  I bought the TP Link at Fry's for $19.  Save your $30 and use it to buy the TP Link TL-WN722N..
B00127RAJY|5.0|Just completed my first 30 days. Saw improvement in my body shape after two weeks. Have lost 8 lbs. without changing my diet..
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game. Creative solutions. Had a great time playing the app with friends. My kids even enjoyed trying to figure out how to escape the rooms.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|If I would be able to get out of this; I would give this a 5 star.But getting out of the game is possible maybe I would be able to get out.
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|This is a great example of why 40 something and older get less repect from the younger crowd. I would not reccomend it.
B002ZIABPO|5.0|This band is killing me. The sounds and rythms of their style make me feel like being in trance. I love them.
1577314808|5.0|I love this book even though it has been around a few years. The wisdom in this book is great!
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|I wanted to see the new movie, and read a review that it was important to watch the two previous movies.  I had seen them before, but it has obviously been years.  To see them together within the same weekend, was SO enjoyable.  Treat yourself..watch these two...then go to Before Midnight.  It's a great love affair.  Each of them is important to see how the story unfolds. I absolutely love them.  The first could stand on its own...but these second one is essential before seeing the new movie.  Great acting, great directing. Must see!
B003N0XDT4|4.0|It meets my expecatives. Great sound quality and it works with my Galaxy S3. It's ok for the price it is sold.
0807014273|5.0|This book is not only inspirational for those in the field of psychology but also for basically everyone. It describes the authors life journey and how he survived concentration camps and it will inspire you to review your outlook on life.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|if you like Les Miserables then you have to own the movie. I love this movie. This was a good buy.
B003DXS3O6|5.0|This album is, for me, the best of The National and with the Violet color is something very special. I can listen to it for hours and hours. I love it.
B0083Z614S|4.0|I was absolutely delighted with this book.It was a joy to see the happiness which the garden brought to the children,also the description brought the garden to life.
B00BG08FKK|4.0|if you like Les Miserables then you have to own the music. I love this music. This was a good buy.
B007LNJ3YS|5.0|The best of all Beach House releases. Enjoying it so much. Sound great on my turntable. One of my greatest buys.
B000FFJ85I|4.0|Not like your old school AFI but still good. Originally purchased it for a few songs and ended up enjoying the whole album.
B00005ASOC|5.0|this was an uplifting story about a kid who wants to make something of himself and i don't think he has the advantages that some others do.
B009NY43NY|5.0|The ending was not what I expected but it I can understand why it ended this way.  I would highly recommend this book expecially if you have read the entire series.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Enthralling story, excellent  prose, a true pleasure to read. From the moment I started reading I found every spare moment I could to progress in the story.
B00177YA1K|5.0|this was a good movie and it was back when will smith was cool and everybody thought he was a good guy who did nothing wrong.  and we liked him in this movie and in Independence Day before it.  men in black was good too.  it was not as good as the first one but as far as sequels go it was good.
B0042XA2U4|5.0|I missed watching the entire movies so I purchased the book.  What a great way to get through the greeving process.  I would recommend this book.
B0028IDXDS|4.0|My baby would not take a pacifier (from birth to now, 6 months) yet had a very strong suck/chew desire.  A friend (pediatrician) gave us one of these as a shower gift.  My son LOVES it.  He chews/sucks on it from all angles and it sooths him like nothing else. The pacifier is very well attached, I inspect it daily and it is not loosening or wearing at all.  We ordered this second one so we would have a spare.<br />Highly recommend! Buy it! It’s the best 15 bucks we have spent.
B00008G8M4|5.0|innocent fun and exciting.  back when will smith was cool and squeaky clean.  also like him in men in black.
B008X9Z37A|3.0|Protects okay but does not have a way of staying closed. If I dropped it it could easily flap open and bust the glass. Should of went with the Otter Box
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is fun got to plan or u will get stuck never though game will be fun. Got to keep playing. This game is is fun this game is fun
B009EHDU7U|3.0|I quite liked it, it was a gentle, fun story, &#34;imaginatively&#34; weaving a variety of 20th century events into one man's long life.
B00AAQHP66|4.0|Ordered this for my 14 year old and was awed by the photography. Have more respect for surfers now.<br />Not a bad movie to watch with your kid(s).
B00992CF6W|5.0|if u just a kindle fire first app to get (minecraft pocket edition) if you think its way to much for a game its very worth it
B006LSZECO|5.0|this book definitely lived up to the hype. i didn't think it would, but i thoroughly enjoyed it. i will look for other works by this author.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I enjoyed the puzzles and search features of this game and<br />I Would say that  Overall it is a good game
B00992CF6W|5.0|Oh my God, I don't know where to start!! This app is............ AMAZING!!! The bed try app ever! I got my kindle fire for Christmas and I had no clue amazing games like this existed! Please buy it and it will be worth every cent you paid for it! Aries out!
B00422LESO|3.0|this is a classic example of chick lit. it has a decent story line and the characters held my attention, but i wasn't vested in them.
B008I3RARW|4.0|Actually this app is a bit disappointing. I was not happy with the app's controls and graphics overall. I think app urgently needs update. That would be great if you can release it ASAP.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is very entretainig and fun to play. Thank you Amazon for ofering the game. I look farword to playing for many hours.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love this series! Totally missed 're ending coming this time. Wow can this woman write a book! Can't wait  to see what she comes up with next.
B008OOYALE|3.0|This app is pretty good, but it is also a copy of dragonvale(which I think is better). Overall the game is fun, but it takes a long time to load on my kindle fire. Hope this helped.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I think it's great .you can see how full your battery is and that amazing!<br />And I'm amazed.I've never seen such a great app like it before.its ,just amazing. It's SO amazing that the only way to explain it  is amazing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awsome but i wish it would update faster for kindle i putting five stars for it to be fixed im still on version 0.7.1
B009R659L8|3.0|I figured it out before book ended. Not a cliff hanger. Not one of Higgins best. Might be a beach read but not a good mystery.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|There was a passable plot, reasonable acting, and fantastic action. Willis seemed genuine. The plot twists were predictable. The car stunts were way over the top amazing. But by the end, we were expecting a smoother treatment, better flow. I think the editing is the weakest point.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The first book was great this one was awesome now it's time to finish with mockingjay with I imagine is fantastic!
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|It is obvious QOTSA - but really really fresh.  My wife thinks it's a big departure from older QOTSA.  I agree and disagree - but we both love it none the less!
B00992CF6W|1.0|Amazon if you don't update soon I will never buy anything from this place again. I mean it. If you value your customers you would put the dang update on already! I am not the only mad customer here!!! UPDATE NOW!!!!!!!!
B005LAIHPE|5.0|Maybe it is a little &#34;out there,&#34; as I have read in other reviews, but I watch action movies to &#34;escape,&#34; and you can certainly escape with Battleship.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|This is an album that shows a progression of Deep Purple.After all these years they can still put out great music, an added plus is Bob Ezrin's production. He did for them on this album what he did for Kiss on Destroyer, lifted their sound to a whole new level.<br /> Just buy you will like it.
1400034205|3.0|I  found this smooth but rather dated and empty. Not a interesting as I had hoped from Maugham, more's the pity.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|Tom Keifer is an underrated talent ,I saw Cinderella about 15 years ago . He came out on stage and it was clear he was sick and not feeling well. Sung his heart out, great show. He is a great singer songwriter and I heartily recommend this album.
0425263924|5.0|It was hard for me to go into this book with a clear head since I had read some of the reviews before I received my book.  I didn't know what to expect, but I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed it; not as much as the first two books but SD did not disappoint me.  I am now in the process of re-reading it so I can enjoy it on my terms.  The only request I have is that you not make us wait as long as we had to wait for this book.  That I can understand and agree with people's frustration about.  It shouldn't take an author that long in between books.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|a great beginning to the Star Trek story. A time line changed and history may never be the same. Great!
B005SCSL56|5.0|It was  a really good book and I actually feel bad for the evil queen. I also think it was adventurous and full of imagination!!!!
B002C949KE|5.0|Very valuable research that can help you become aware of the common mistakes in your daily life and, also, valuable tips for business too.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I am not usually a fiction reader, but it caught my eye since I also havea 14-year old (only) son.  Good read, fairly realistic, and gripping.  SPOILER ALERT!!!  I was disappointed that we didn't have resolution at the end, but life is like that sometimes.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This is definitely the best alarm clock app out there. I love the equations and customization that Alarm Clock Xtreme offers.
B003UYUP58|5.0|Probably tells the lay reader more than he can assimilate; however, still valuable in explaining the complexities of the disease and the dedication and tenacity of researchers in unlocking these complexities.
0679805273|5.0|I give this book to all my friends as they graduate college! I absolutely love it! It's perfect for graduations!
B00BHU9DUK|3.0|Great direction, staging, sets, scene changes, etc.  Swore it was baz lurman - very innovative in a way that really helped tell the story.  Knightley's perpetually scunched up face and general lack of appeal pretty much killed it for me, though.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I am so sorry I wasted my money and my time on this latest by Sylvia Day which can barely be called a novel. The first half was spent rehashing everything we read about in her prior book. She merely retold what we already knew. Then the ending was very poorly left as a hook to sell her next book.<br />I won't bother reading it. I'm done with Sylvia Day. She is obviously milking this for the money.
B008U7ZPHS|4.0|These book series are a great source of 1. entertainment 2. information on Greek/Roman mythology. The plot is captivating and it submerges you in the world of Greek/Roman gods while enjoying a good adventures book. Particularly recommended for teens, but a good read at any age.

B00CW665VI|4.0|SERIOUSLY, if you haven't read this book, you are missing out. I really don't remember when it was the last time I laughed so much.<br /><br />Drew is an Adonis in every sense of the word. He thinks he is a fallen version of God or Zeus himself. I love the way the writer wraps ups in his egocentric, self center, chauvinistic, cocky personality and still I couldn't hate the guy. All to the contrary, I was attracted to him because above all, I was able to connect with his human side, his weak side, with the side of his heart that it humble, and caring and protective. SIGH!<br /><br />What I also liked A LOT was that his counterp<br />art Cate, instead of being a crying, martyr, victim, moping girl...she was as strong, self secure, intelligent and witty as he was. Fortunately, the writer keeps us interesting with the banter between this two hard headed Lyons (well, Lyon and lioness) which made of this book a fortunate winner.<br /><br />Kudos for the writer, this was very smart and funny writing. I hope there is a \\"To be continuing\\"...on this one, I'd like to know what's next for them,
193700788X|2.0|After my anticipation about the last installment in this series, I was left considerably deflated at its conclusion.  Seriously?  It's as though Charlaine Harris cobbled together random, superficial bits and pieces in her rush to reach - and deliver - the end of the series, giving the impression that she really couldn't be bothered to end things properly, didn't care what happened to the characters moving forward (with so many drifting off into the ether), and was, quite simply, more interested in just ending it.  Beloved, well-known characters were suddenly two-dimensional and in the periphery, making the occasional (somewhat pointless) cameo - being included for the sake of it, rather than adding to the story.<br /><br />Such an incredibly disappointing end to a series that I had so thoroughly enjoyed - definitely a fizzle, rather than the magical bang I'd hoped for.
B004EPYZXU|2.0|It was 1974.  The year I graduated High School.  I remember it well.  Elton John had big hits, like Rocket Man.  Nixon resigned in disgrace. The Vietnam war ended (and Lo and Behold, contrary to military propaganda, the commies DIDN'T take us over!)  Everything was recorded on 8mm film.  And Kennedy's words were still hanging in the air,  \\"We choose to go to the moon in this decade, and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because we want to expose our astronauts to some pretty scary stuff.\\"<br /><br />And the rest is history. . . NOT!!!

B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I first became aware of Jack Reacher (Lee Child) via the film trailer. So I looked it up and decided to get the first novel.<br /><br />I thought it had some good twists and story line. My only problem is that I'm not sure that anyone, in today’s society, can be that far off the grid and still be effective. No driver’s license. No credit cards. No money. Buying (used) clothes when the ones you have get dirty.<br /><br />OK, all that aside Mr. Child has a good imagination and the story follows a well thought out plot. The characters appear to be real life. Good and bad in the same person. Reacher's mind is sharp and analytical. Able to figure out who the bad guys are and thwart their plans. The person(s) who go after Reacher better kill him because they will lose if they give Reacher half a chance...

0425062651|4.0|I like the book.  I dislike the seller.  They have proven to be untrustworthy.  The book was not &#34;new&#34; as I expected when I ordered.  If it was &#34;new,&#34; as claimed prior to them sending it, this was the worst handling of a shipment I have ever seen.  The binding was so damaged durring shipping that the book fell appart within the first 50 pages of me reading it.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book is a great story that shows the struggles of two characters to survive the most deadly event in the country of Panem.  The characters show true emotion and an exhilarating adventure makes you never want to stop reading. Suzanne Collins does a great job of capturing the interest of its readers and I am excited to read more books by this author. I would recommend The Hunger Games to people of all ages that enjoy an exciting action adventure with a hint of romance.

B0027MJU00|5.0|I like Gillian Flynn quite a bit.  I really enjoyed both Gone Girl and Sharp Objects!  But, when reading the summary of this book, it just didn't grip me.  The thought of a \\"kill club\\" sounded a little too unrealistic and desolate to me.  But a year after finishing both of the others  I finally downloaded this one since I was in between my book club books so thought it would be a quick read to hold me over.  And I've been raving about it since.  I'm not sure I liked it MORE than Gone Girl, but for such a different feel, I definitely liked it as much.<br /><br />It's also done in her traditional rotating perspective chapters, and that worked very well for this novel, but this had flash-back chapters from prior to the murders which was very intriguing (especially seeing back in the mind of someone you knew was killed).  Once I realized that we were back on the actual day of the murders, I couldn't put the book down!  (now, I do admit that it probably took me longer than it should to realize that I had been reading flashbacks of that day for a few chapters).<br />I love how all of her characters are flawed.  Every one of them.  There's no one in this cast that is \\"pure\\" and I really appreciate how she can take such an honest, human approach to her books.<br /><br />The tone is dark and has the feeling of a thriller, but not a fast-paced, heart-pounding kind.  The suspense is there from the beginning, but not in the normal way.  We already know the outcome.  The slaughter of the family has already been done and the murderer is in jail.  But as the story unfolds, there are so many more layers that keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />I really have very few complaints about this one.  It was definitely gritty and bloody at times - so maybe it's not for the faint of heart, but none of it seemed gratuitous to me.  And (small SPOILER through the end of this paragraph), I was a tiny bit disappointed in the ending.  I mean, EVERYONE had a motive.  There was someone new that I predicted to be the \\"actual\\" killer at each turn.  I was also partially convinced at times that Ben was the true killer, but maybe it was somehow through different circumstances than made public.  So, when it was over and the killer revealed, I was a little upset that I couldn't have really predicted it no matter what.  I would have liked it to have been someone that if I thought hard enough and focused on all the tiny details (which I wouldn't have anyway), I COULD have guessed prior to the ending.  But, then again, if it was at all predictable, I probably would have complained about that also.  My disappointment with this one was different than Gone Girl, though, which upset me because it didn't really HAVE an ending.  This one was a very definite conclusion and we got our answers, but maybe not in the way I was hoping for.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this.  It was an awesome page-turner.  I love books that make me want to read instead of doing anything else productive!
B009ZUZ9FW|5.0|Previously having a fair grasp of C++, I thought I should briefly take a look at programming in pure C.

0425263908|3.0|I guess I should start with a full disclosure that I am not a gluttonous romance novel fan anyway, but I didn't love this book.  I read it based on STRONG recommendation from a couple of friends, so I gave it a shot.  And I felt like it was way too similar to 50 Shades (which I also didn't enjoy too much).  I'm sure a lot of others have made that comment so far, and I realize there are basic differences, but the rich aloof guy and the relationship that appears to circulate around just good sex with very little other intimacy made it too much of a copy-cat story.  I wasn't invested in the couple and did not feel that they had a believable relationship outside of a basic sexual infatuation.  There was no depth.  And...I'm not opposed to shallow books, but I didn't find myself eager to continue reading with such a flat narrative.<br /><br />I didn't feel like there were any original thoughts or anticipatory moments.  I guess it was entertaining enough, but just didn't grip me the way I was expecting by such high reviews.  I'll give #2 a shot and see if it gains enough momentum for me to finish out the series.
0307346617|1.0|It's a piece of highly overrated s***! It started off interesting and now I regret buying it. I lost all my excitement for the upcoming movie. What a disappointment.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|So I did enjoy this book more than the first, but I didn't feel like the plot separated itself enough from the other highly sexual romance novels that have become popular lately.  The storyline was a little too predictable and their \\"true love\\" wasn't gripping or believable enough for me to finish the series.  It was definitely a sexy book, but the actual story is lacking pretty much all depth.<br /><br />The storyline of the concert and incident after the concert were forced.  There's no way the situation would have progressed like that - it was a silly forced \\"twist\\".  As for the ending with the big \\"reveal\\" from the detective, it was very trite and way too obvious.  As was the revelation of Gideon's past.  Was anyone surprised by that transparent plot point?  I know that there is a place for this type of shallow romance novel, but it's not for me and I won't be finishing the series.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|When I heard that Khaled Hosseini had written another book, I was excited. I thoroughly enjoyed the first two. I was not disappointed with the third.

I am sad that I have finished reading it.

B008BU75IQ|5.0|I think Archer is one of those authors you either love or you hate.  If you love him, like me, you'll love this book.  The plot as usual is intricately woven, the villains easy to hate and once again he uses his signature hook at the end to get you chomping at the bit to get your hands on the next book in the series.<br /><br />If you don't like books that end leaving you hanging then this is probably not for you.  If you don't mind that...get it, it's a cracker.

B00CLL1UY6|5.0|Sebastian: Christoph Fischer<br /><br />Courage is defined as the \\" the quality of mind or spirit that enables a person to face difficulty, danger, pain without fear. But, it can mean even more. Once that initial fear or obstacle is defined and the person overcomes that hindrance, drawback or impediment, something has to take over to keep them going. Handicaps are defined as conditions that restrict a person's ability to function physically, mentally or socially. If convinced by others that you are incapable of handling specific situations or brainwashed into thinking either by listening to the voices of others or low self-esteem that you cannot embark on the career of your choice because of your limitations, then your whole life will be dealing with one handicap after another.<br /><br />Sebastian is a uniquely crafted story that has many layers and characters that often appear to have many flaws. Each character striving so hard to find a place in the world so filled with hate, prejudice and the threat of war, that they often overlook the simple things in life like family, joy and just love. Sebastian is a young teenage boy who likes so many others does not dwell on an injury when there are more important things to concentrate on. However, not focusing on the pain in his left leg and hiding the fact that the leg was infected cost him more than any young teen should have to endure. This accident that caused his injury and the final result was his leg was amputated causing his family to feel that he can no longer contribute to their family business, not able to run their family grocery store and limited, as one doctor would say to few careers. Vienna, Austria is the setting and the loss of his leg had nothing to do with his brilliant mind.<br /><br />Parents that seemed on the outside to be happy yet when you pull apart the many lawyers of Franz and Vera Schrieber, what you mind find will surprise you. Franz, the owner of this grocery store has many responsibilitiesand feels the pressure of having to not only provide for his immediate family but his elderly parents who reside with him. His son's accident although represented a weakness in the child and although he cares for him he neglected visiting him in the hospital leaving his care to his invalid mother and grandparents.<br /><br />With his father's family living at home, his friends and the many employees that would come through their door the author graphically depicts pre-war Vienna, the struggles of so many families, the lives of many people during the time of the war and the end when the Monarchy was taken down. Just how would this man manage to fend for his family and find time to care for his wife and son? Responsibility can be defined in this case as \\" Involving personal accountability or ability to act without guidance or superior authority: a responsible position within the firm.\\" Franz treated each day and his family more like a business and was so concerned with his wants and needs he overlooks what is happening right in front of him. Vera, his wife is the definition of a woman who has no idea of what is happening in the world around her, current events elude her and working in the store and greeting customers when needed her only outlet for interacting with people. The author's research into the war, the government of Austria and the arrival of technology and the changes some were trying to make are extensive. Many people do not understand change, Vienna like many other countries embraced a class system and often those employed as household workers had to be of other faiths in order to work in certain homes. From the Five Star author of \\"The Luck of the Weissensteinters,\\" comes another five star novel, which deals with many of the same layers, themes and ideals. Sebastian focuses on a family that needs to embrace their identities as individuals, prejudice among their own and others, fears, deceit, lies and even betrayals and hope.<br /><br />When Sebastian istold about his infection from a rusty nail and the fact that because it was not treated the end result would be losing his leg, we wonder how he will deal with the news. Vera, his mother is fearful that when told the young man would not be able to handle the news, not sleep and requests the operation be done that night and not in the morning as the doctor suggested. Convincing the doctor the young man goes through this operation only to prove that not only he is resilient, smart and courageous but will not succumb to his illness and hopes to attend school and take his exams.<br /><br />Vera, as well as the medical situation that lingers throughout the story that takes twists and turns along with the plots and subplots to help define a character that goes from being weak to growing an inner strength and beauty. Sebastian's story is the story of his family, the women who enter his life and the war that surrounds and defines them all. Living above a grocery store reminds me of growing up in the South Bronx, in a small apartment with my grandparents, sister and parents over a grocery store, beauty parlor and candy store. Picturing all of these people in this enclosed environment brings to light just how difficult the times were and how this young man who only wanted to bring some joy into the lives of others was only embraced by one person, his grandfather the original owner of the store. Sebastian's injury did not affect his mind, ability to learn or his will to succeed. His grandfather, Oscar was his champion and was there for him every step of the way tutoring him and making sure that his lessons were done and that he would pass his exams. Testing him, teaching him the material gave not only Sebastian the impetus to go on but his grandfather a reason for getting up in the morning. His grandmother, Rebecca had a bad back and were ability to do anything was limited as was his mother Vera whose conditions changed on a momentary basis. Leaving the hospital put a strain on his family as his mother wanted to devote her time caring for her son whose leg would require more surgery and she took blame for the complications.<br /><br />Vera needs an ally to bring her out and show her she can do more than just take care of the store and deal with problems. Enter Mathilde and her family who seems to have influence in many important places. Suggesting she join a women's group whose goal is to help women understand and fight for the right to vote and voice their opinion, Vera agrees but stands to the side the entire time. With the help of Theresa, Mathilde's mother in law, she begins to thrive in many different ways and learn more about herself. In walks what is supposed to be relief and help but turns out to be more than Vera can handle. An eighteen year old girl named Ingeborg is sent to work in the home and where needed in the store. Hoping to become more than just an employee she bides her time, endears herself within the folds of the family and eventually hopes to replace Vera in Franz's bed. But, Vera might be naïve and not suspect anything until her friend Mathilde enlightens her and what happens is right out of a soap opera. Replaced but not really knowing why Eva comes to work for the family and Sebastian is taken with her But her secret is well kept as to why she was discharged from her past job and the situation heats up until she leaves and is replaced by Margit and her mother. Here is where the story gets really hot and very interesting as Vera's friends will help change the dynamics of her life and she becomes involved in séances, the afterlife and communicating with the dead.<br /><br />The primary cast is Jewish and the questions raised are many as the family needs to cater to people of many nationalities, lives are unsettled and a country is about to undergo many changes. WWI is about to begin and so many men have enlisted, are fighting for their country and the war has caused Sebastian to have to step up before his time asFranz is drafted and on the front lines fighting. Each family member seems to have his/her own agenda and when Oscar passes away leaving them without his wisdom and guidance Rebecca and Vera are left to deal with the store, Franz's absence and Sebastian. But, Sebastian decides for himself with the help of a special nurse where he wants his life to go and school is not an option it is his choice.<br /><br />As things changed and Eva left and a mother and daughter came to live with them Sebastian soon came to fall for Margit and her mother, although depressed, loud and abusive at times found her way into the family on a limited basis.  With her mother hiding her own treasure, her distrust for the Schreiber family and people in general the plot takes on a different tone as the war is in full swing, the draft has lowered its expectations as Sebastian has now left what was a great position in a library to have to teach school. People are cruel, no allowances for his disability made and the family seems to becoming unglued as Eva reappears, Sebastian and Margit have a child but then things change.<br /><br />Joining her two friends and others in a séance Vera thinks that her husband is gone, her job now to care for her granddaughter and when both the mother and grandmother disappear without due cause or any hint she is left to deal with the fallout. Just where did they go and how did they get there takes the reader on a remarkable train ride from Vienna to Galicia where we learn the probable fate her Markit's father, who is now living in their home, what their feelings towards the Jewish people are and the history behind what happened in Poland, Russia and to the Jewish people. But, the times are changing and Piroska, Markit's mother decides to venture out on her own with the help of some of her husband's contacts to find out where he is and if he is coming back to her. What she learns is quite startling whether she believes what they tell her remains to be seen. Finding her way back to her daughter, where they were staying would only be a stop gap for her search is never ending, she is relentless and her feelings for her husband regardless of what he is doing overpower her.<br /><br />An ending so dramatic and heart wrenching you won't see it common and characters that are so true to lift you will definitely identify with many of them. Betrayals, lies, deceits, family loyalties tested, the human spirit quite fragile and an ending that will surprise the reader and a group of people so courageous, filled with hope that their journey back to Vienna would be successful. Sometimes a miscommunication can change your life. Find out how when you read this outstanding novel.  Courage: What's your definition?

B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I really enjoy this app because I had raised tropical fish for a living many years ago and also worked at the Steinhardt Aquarium in San Francisco.  I had downloaded this app on April 17th and almost got to the end.  I woke up one morning and the app had disappeared off of my devise.  I was very disappointed of course do to the fact that I only needed to collect a few more fish.  I don't care for the fact that they make you buy algae and coins or pearls when you first start the game.  Otherwise the game is a lot of fun and enjoyable.

B004LWZWGA|5.0|This movie is the best movie than The Dark Knight. I own this movie and I am glad I got it. Why because when it came out to theaters I got to go see it and it was worth seating in the theater for like almost three hours it was worth my time. Anybody who enjoys the DC characters like Batman and your trying to build or finish your movie collection of DC don't forget to add The Dark Knight Rises its radical!
B00BY9GQHM|4.0|The biggest one is that you can purchase a Jack-in-the-Box for $25K points and game says you will get back $15K for every scene where you find it - well it continually paid only $10K everytime. Others would have noticed this glaring error too and this should have been fixed since release date! Poor testing at base!
B0034G4OYA|5.0|I love this movie when it was advertised on TV a lot I was really hoping to go see it in theaters but I never got the chance to see it. So for my birthday in march I got the movie and it was worth it. Why because its really funny, charming, happiness, and will make the whole family smile and laugh. It did to me and I am only 16 my two little brothers really like it too. Its a great buy don't forget to check it out!
B00BQ1D7X4|3.0|The album seems to be stuck in a sonic groove that is pervasive in nearly all of the songs.  It's a down-beat and grind that resonates with little exception.  I appreciate the AIC vibe which is also very prevalent, but to me the album doesn't rise up and out of it's own fuzzy and murky groove.  There are a few songs that incorporate changes in tempo and beat but the overall style is a more hardcore grind with monotonous tempo.  It's great that AIC is still making music but this sounds a lot like Cantrell's solo stuff - which isn't all bad.  To be clear: I own every AIC album and all of Cantrell and Staley's side projects. This is just my humble opinon.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I finally got this movie! You guys would love it. I got to see it in theaters and it was great! This movie is pretty funny, sad, and there are some scary parts but there not bad at all but maybe for the little ones. Any way you should try to get this sometime or if you have it and have not watched it yet don't forget to you would like it.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|I was surprised about how quickly the CD got to me, and I thoroughly enjoy much of their music. I highly recommend this product to anyone, especially those that have not listened to the work of The Piano Guys!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Awesome game...buy it and try it, you wont be disapointed!! Worth the 199, truly unique and rewarding experience. Do it.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|This was a fascinating read! I thought I had read about asl kinds of mental problems, but this was something so different and absorbing to read about.  The ending was so unexpected.  It was on my all time favorite books, and I will continue to recommend it.
0800141660|5.0|My favorite movie
B006IGZWB2|5.0|I tried to watch it on tv put couldn't figure out how - so I purchased  it but didn't get to watch it?
B00D2K40WY|1.0|wants you to buy other ones! If you want to see and use the other models, you have to buy them. Lots of pop ups.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was soooooo disappointed ...felt ripped off by one of my favorite authors ...I felt like this installment was very confusing and all over the place...it was nothing but a pointless read with a few hot sex scenes ..don't think I'll be wasting another 10 bucks on this series , soooooo not worth it....:/
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This season was great.  I am left in suspense on what happens to Matthew.  All of the seasons have been great.  I love all the characters from the house maids to the main family.  I love the British grandma.  She is hillarious!  I cannot wait until season 4.  We have a long time to wait (January 2014).  I wish the season was like other TV series.  I would watch all year.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|This album was worth buying song 1 and 3 where very good and the rest was nice easy listening over all I was impressed
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a really awesome game but you can't update it's cause I really want the 0.7.1 update to come out for tablets,and kindle fire because I try to update it with my kindle fire but it hasn't came out for tablets,and kindle fire.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game is so realistic its unbelievable. I wish it was easier to earn diamonds though. and also the horses get tired so easily.
0425263991|5.0|Heart of Obsidian is dark but never bleak, perfectly hot and steamy, beautiful and powerful in the storytelling. The MCs (whom I won't name) are the stars of the show, with plenty of cameos to satisfy fans of the series, and the book contains enough answers to tie up long standing plot lines and enough questions to reassure us that we'll be visiting the Psy/Changeling world again soon.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I bought this app yesterday and I love it all it needs is more weapons from world war two and the graphics are amazing!!
B00992CF6W|2.0|I would've gave it five but New update is terrible. Can't play multiplayer because realms are never open. Mojang fix this please!
B0035JRUZQ|5.0|I have always liked this movie. It is a John Wayne Western directed by Howard Hawks. This one has a little humor that he began putting in to his later (1960;'s) westerns.  Wayne and Mitchum make a good partnership and with James Caan and Christopher George it is just a fun western. I did not and would never win any awards but is a fun movie about an aging gunslinger who choses to help his old from, Mitchum against some unruly characters, Christopher George and Ed Asner. Great fun.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I've had this game on my amazon kindle fire . The pros is you have alot of stuff from the pc version .the cons is that if you have it on kindle fire for amazon u don't get the update, only the 0.6.1 alpha. And they released the 0.7.0 on Friday and I haven't got it . Am I ever gonna get a update??
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This calculator is easy to use; it provides all expected math functions; the display and keys are sized right for easy viewing.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is great dont get me wrong . It's just that the updates are slow in coming. Im still waiting for 1.7 update. Other than that this game is great. I highly recommend this to you to play.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|The waiting times are frustrating on a busy schedule. As well as having to use crystals to purchase some Dragon types such as Sun and moon dragons.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Excellent story. I watch Castle and love it. I needed to see it Richard Castle could actually write - he can!
B00D2K40WY|5.0|It was the coolest make up game I'd ever tryd and I was speechless. But I think it needs more beautiful dresses because it doesn't have  all of the dresses<br /><br />Love jim.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|Jonasson's creative exploration of the exploits of The One Hundred-Year-Old Man in present time are interspersed with his adventures throughout his earlie life.  These inform / remind the reader of historical events in an intriguing way.
B009C7JS14|5.0|I think it should allow you to do more than one place it only lets you do to unless you want the $1.99 one.

B002BU0DPE|5.0|the PS3 Ear Force PX21 Gaming Headset purchased from Amazon has been exactly what i expected and is satisfactory in all respects. would recomend it to anyone looking for this type of item.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I've always been a fan of the paranormal as well as fantasy stories so I decided to give this book a try. I was instantly sucked into Sophia Parson's world. She's the town weirdo, the outcast, but you can't help but root for her cause. She's got plenty of things to deal with, including her strange abilities and a mysterious new man in her life, Charles. This book is well written and leaves you wanting more. If you love the paranormal, fantasy or romance genre, 'The Forever Girl' has it all. I can't wait to read the next book in the series.
B003G4W49C|5.0|The Ender quintet is a series of books, of which I have read 2. Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow were both excellent.
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|After I finished watching Beautiful Creatures, I was filled with so many emotions and feelings. Words like terrible, mediocre, ruined, disappointing were a fews of the words that kept on cropping up in my mind. The film adaptation of Beautiful Creatures is a disgrace, a mutilation of one of my favorite books.<br /><br />  This film took so many of my favorite elements from the novel and completely cast them out the window. The gothic tone and emotion that were evident in the novel are lacking in the movie. Where was the suspense, the danger of the casters? This movie didn't feel like the book at all because it discarded so much. This movie was more of a sappy love story than the dark, paranormal tale that the book was. Instead of being dark and gritty, this movie was extremely cheesy, cliche, and ridiculous.<br /><br />  From the get-go, I was kind of annoyed with Alden's accent and it struck me as extremely fake. People from the South don't talk like that at all, it can't help that Alden broke from his accent and acted without a several times during the movie.  He isn't a terrible actor but I'm not sure if he was right for the role of Ethan. He doesn't look 16 at all and he can't pass for a high school student at all. Alden portrayed Ethan in a melodramatic way that made the Beautiful Creatures feel so sappy and cheesy. There were one or two moments where I could tell Alden really got into character and those short moments are where he briefly shined.<br /><br />  One of the biggest problems with this movie is the script and the plot. The director, Richard LaGravenese cut some of the best dialogue and scenes from the book. There were so many times when he put in jokes that were just so not funny. The dialogue in this movie isn't much better and I feel like LaGravenese should have just lifted dialogue from the source material. There were so many unnecessary changes that this mutilation didn't even feel like Beautiful Creatures. The ending of this movie was executed so poorly and was pretty illogical. Once again, if the director had bothered to stay true to the novel, this wouldn't have been a problem. The book has a far better ending that is fitting and an ending that actually makes sense.<br /><br />  Don't you think, a director of a book adaptation should read all of the books in the series he/she is adapting? LaGravenese admitted in an interview that he didn't even read all of the books which is beyond ridiculous. How can you expect to make a good adaptation if you can't spend some time devoting yourself to the series? It's like trying to build a building with only bricks, you need the cement and other materials to help complete the job.<br /><br />  The acting from Alice Englert who portrayed Lena did an okay job of portraying her. Her portrayal wasn't spot-on but it was a lot more consistent than Alden's. The real stars of Beautiful Creatures are the seasoned adult actors: Jeremy Irons, Viola Davis, and Emma Thompson. Irons truly gives his portrayal of Macon his all and it is quite evident that he captured Macon's essence perfectly. Irons's performance is truly memorable and is by far the best performance in the movie. Davis and Thompson are great but they can't compare to Irons's solid performance.<br /><br />  Beautiful Creatures doesn't flow well at all from start to finish. Most of the movie runs at a sluggish pace and I kept getting so distracted because the movie didn't really capture my attention. I suffered through the movie in hopes that it would get slightly better. It became a teensy bit better but not much better in the 2nd half of the film. This is a movie that had great potential but it was executed so poorly. I really hope that Warner Brothers doesn't even think of making a sequel because it was that bad. As a fan of the book series, I'm extremely disappointed and repulsed by this mess of a film. I can't believe that the authors were involved in makiso poorly and was pretty illogical.

B0031RAOVY|5.0|I always like this movie and when we changed cable providers, I did not have it recorded it anymore, so I ordered it.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|A rare look at REAL heroes doing the nation's urgent work. An unvarnished look at the sacrifices of our extraordinary warriors and their families. By far the best weapons handling and personal movement I have ever seen in a film. A very engaging and emotional film with true gravitas. If you want some escapism, ruined Hollywood style, this isn't it. Real Americans should see this movie and then thank every veteran... after they have contributed to some of the many veterans support organizations. The less than 1% that serve deserve our support, not just our gratitude!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|AWESOME!If u lug gun apps:first get weaphones then get this.ive tried tons of gun apps and none of them are even comparable to weaphones.get it seriously. its ONE OF THOSE APPS THAT LAST A CENTURY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0010SEN18|2.0|I didn't find this helpful at all. Lots of specialized techniques that aren't applicable in daily life for the amateur/hobbyist.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I love the story line that she is following in the Crossfire series however hat eht ending of this book.  Not even sure what to be looking forward to in the next book.  With the other two books there was the basis of a plot built at the end and this one just seems to leave you hanging.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The plot was different and precipitated a great deal of introspection on my part.  I kept asking myself what I would do.  Ultimately,  I felt fully engaged in this story, wanting to know what happened next.  Very interesting read.

125000098X|5.0|Archer is always a great storyteller and this is not different.  Couldn't wait for this followup in sequence to come out and he didn't disappoint.
B00BSBXZDY|4.0|Very good movie... Great graphics... Great message... Every age will enjoy this movie... Something new even when is about characters that everyone believe in when we were younger... Message: Believing is important and everybody deserve a sencond oportunity.
B002RI9MWA|5.0|I bought the book after hearing a review of the movie, during which they praised the book, & I read it first. It is written in an unusual style - a story within a story and is a quick read. This is a very timely reminder not to judge people by their race or religion.<br />The movie is a bit different but is an understandable cinematic way to tell the story & is also excellent.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|fun reads! no literary genius but great page turners. i like this series it's exciting and absorbing action and suspense
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|Sure, I came into this with a preconceived notion that they couldn't do much more with Arnold than what's already been done, but this movie sets our man into a perfect role, and character. he readied his town, without outside help,( as usual), and the movie provided a classic standoff with Arnold and the chief criminal...c'mon, if you were ever an Arnold fan, you'll watch this. The only downside was &#34;welcome to Somerton&#34;, (talking about Arizona),...being from, and still in AZ, I thought &#34;okay, great, I'll see some familiar landscape.....well, the credits say, &#34;filmed in New Mexico&#34;...but, nice job making me think of Arizona all the time! This movie is worth a look.
0307346609|5.0|Max Brooks takes a very unique approach to his book on the zombie apocalypse by doing it as an interview style follow up after the war is over. I thought this approach was great. His weaves an intricate story that touches upon various themes many of us can relate to.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|I don't know how they created the disaster events in this movie, but I'll tell you what, it put me right there in the middle of it all. Incredible drama, revealing the quest, and hunger of people, stricken with disaster, to fight to live, and push forward. The realism is very accurate, and not for the faint of heart. And in the very end, the light which shined into the small plane, had an almost divine appeal to it.....recommend this!

B004ZRV3AU|5.0|When you figure out how to use it properly it works every time.. And for the price I've already made back my money by selling things I made with it.. Thanks
193700788X|3.0|Wow how disappointing this book was to me.  It was very rushed at the end and was a sad way to end the series. You have to read it if you have read the others but will be sad to find out that a few more books could have been written to end this series instead of wrapping it up in 300 pages.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I really enjoyed this book as I enjoyed the first book in the The Selection trilogy.<br /><br />I find myself mildly impressed with the writing. I found the books easy to read and each page drove the plot further. There weren't unnecessary scenes that failed to build characters or further the journey of the competition.<br /><br />I usually am not impressed with flip flopping love stories, but America seemed genuinely confused in her feelings and frustratingly inept at figuring it out. She kept me turning each page wanting to see where she ended up(and with who), and I found myself changing who I cheered for several times throughout the read.<br /><br />The setting seems like this book is a vapid read intended for boy crazy teen girls, but I definitely see parts where this book strives to be more meaningful. As a dystopian novel this book is in part a commentary on politics and other serious topics, but does not directly confront any construct besides societal class systems. I think this book touches on moral righteousness and mentions justice a couple times, but those topics are not fully formed. I expect/hope the third book will touch closer on these topics.<br /><br />The ending was encouraging and hopeful, it left me excited and impatient to start the third of the trilogy.<br /><br />It was a little weird/arrogant that at the end of the novel Kiera Cass again implies that we would be up all night reading her book. She ended The Selection with a comment under Acknowledgments about saying \\"in case you're really busy or tired because you stayed up late finishing,\\" which wasn't a big deal, I thought it was funny at the time and moved on. Finishing The Elite with \\"I hope it made you have unbearable feelings that you find yourself tweeting about at 3:00 am\\" made me roll my eyes. I thought it was a bit weird that she makes that joke twice.
0439023521|3.0|The book was sealed and looked to be in perfect condition. The only complaint I have is that I paid for 4-6 days of shipping for nothing for it still shipped as normal shipping. I didn't get it in time for what I needed it for, which is upsetting. Other than that, the book itself was good.
B004U52VPS|5.0|The kids like this game but they just set it up and play by their own rules.  They have fun with it.

0765342294|3.0|I think this book was written in the late 70's more for a young age group. It deals with a starship trooper kind of theme. I hear the movie is coming out November , 2013 this year. Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley star in it. I bet I will enjoy the movie more. Not really my kind of story but an ok read.
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|Great disc! Combines some of the sounds from the last 4 albums (heavy blues, harmonica, wa-wa guitar, etc.) and is a great LP rock album!

B008US4PBY|5.0|Purchase this item in order to use an Xbox360 controller on a PS3 system, works like a charm. I was even able to map my 360 controller to work as if it was on an Xbox360.  This is the first devise, Cronus has an extreme version that does a bit more with mods and mapping. I found that if I wanted, I could upgrade this via the companies web site to the extreme version with what I believe would be a firmware upgrade. Which I thought was great.  This item also connects to a Wii, PS3, XBox360 and a PC. One note if you want to use a wireless controller you will need a wireless receiver.  So far I like it, if I decided to upgrade to the Extreme, I will add to this post.

B00BI73CVI|1.0|I did not like it at ,  It had  a great cast so I wanted to watch it but I was very disappointed.
1476733953|3.0|The book reminded me of a Lord of the Flies type environment in a post-apocalyptic underground silo.  I took away a star because the book is sloooow until the last 150 pages (500 page book).  I almost stopped reading halfway through because the story build up to events that happen later was rather dull and uninteresting.  The last third of the book was exciting so I'm kind of glad I stuck through it.  I took another star off because of the lack of character variety.  Almost every character was depressing and had some sort of psychological baggage, which you can argue is because of their environment.  They reminded me of that person that you don't like to talk to because they always talk about something depressing or negative aspects of their life.  I can only think of a couple of characters in the book that weren't candidates for anti-depressants.<br /><br />[spoilers] I don't about anyone else, but it was really hard for me to overlook the big picture of their situation while they were fighting over a lie to keep their society in order.  I kept thinking so you're angry the system is lying to you, but does it really matter if you can't leave anyway. I just saw it as a minor issue compared to the bigger issue of a toxic world on the outside. The author addresses my issue at the end, but it was hard to get behind the main character's motivations from the beginning knowing this.

The film is perfectly appropriate as a PG film and is along the same lines as the Lego Ninjago series in term of maturity. My 6 year old son loves this film and loves the Batman Lego kits. I find the film fun to watch as there is a lot of Lego humor. I only give it 4 stars because, let's be honest, it's a well-made, feature length commercial for the Super Heroes Lego sets.
B008673ZAQ|1.0|I just don't get it.  Why is this a best selling author?  I can think of one word to describe her books:  shallow.  There's no plot, no premise, and nothing to sink your teeth into.  Sad, really.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|this was a super cute movie. My husband and I could totally relate. If you are watching past seasons of LOST and haven't gotten to the end, don't watch this b/c it gives away the ending. Ruined it for my husband.
