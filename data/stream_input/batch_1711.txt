B0018QQQK8|5.0|The Lucky One is a good story.......for guys as well as girls.  All the classic parts of a story are there.... The good, the bad, and a plot that has the various parts interacting.  Mr. Sparks developed the characters in such a way that you can easily visualize them and the various settings.  I would definitely recommend the book to anyone............
B001FQFFMG|5.0|I thought the sound of the music was fantastic. The storyline moved along. I am a new fan of Johnny Cash but I love the stories he told in his songs. People need to understand that you can't fit someone's long life into 120 mins its just not possible. So people stop whining and appreciate the movie for what it showed us about his love story with June Carter. This is what the movie was really about love and him overcoming his very own trials and tribulations in his life.
B000FC1K66|1.0|Had to read for book club but could not finish it, it centered around an older woman involved with a teenager.
0316212377|2.0|I have followed Mr. Banks faithfully since his first book and have never before found him quite so lacking in ideas and character development. Feels like he was on a tight deadline so a lot of the things he was developing in the book get truncated at very awkward, disconcerting or simply silly ways. This book, unlike his others, is almost not at all about humans (or non-AI aliens). It is all about the Minds (his notation for the uber-developed AI's that embody the ships of the Culture) and other AI-like entities. The problem with making it about the AIs is that it feels a lot like a cheat. They are all-seeing, all-powerful and when all else fails they cannot die since they just transmit their Mind elsewhere. Mr. Banks' naming convention around the Minds was an interesting construct for communicating how the Minds are so awesome they don't have to take themselves seriously. Unfortunately in this book he takes it way way farther than what is reasonable and you end up skipping pages and pages of 'email' headers with a long list of nonsensical or tongue-in-cheek names whose Minds then only appear for one or two sentences.<br /><br />The core (and really only) story line: a super advanced civilization has voted to be Sublimed, passing into the mysterious beyond where high-tech folks go when they are bored of the 'real'. No spoiler here that just days before this event that has been planned for 2 generations is to take place, it is suddenly put in jeopardy because it turns out their main religion was possibly a farce. Big ho-hum. The Minds involved ask themselves \\"why are we even getting involved?\\" (I echo the question, though my answer would have been different: 'don't'). Even the Gzilt in the know (the race about to be sublimed), also wonder if it is worth it to make any fuss about this since a large percent of the population already thought their religion was bogus anyway. In any case, this 'threat' to the sublimation leads to a cascade of bloody senseless killings that are accepted and non-intervened or revenged by the Culture since The Minds are only focused on finding the Truth, all morality and justice be damned. I kept waiting for one of the author's truly excellent human or humanoid characters that are able to bridge the guileless Minds and human spirit, creating compelling story lines. If not, then at least some plot twist so I could start caring. Maybe some end-of-the-universe risk. Nah. How could I care about a few trillion beings either staying in the Real and living the awesome carefree, scarcity-free life of an advanced civilization or going into some eternal spiritual paradise. 6 of one, half a dozen of the other. Hard to be stressed either way. And btw, they could have it both ways and some go and some stay.<br /><br />The one developed human character is basically taken along for a ride, and unlike other successful unwitting heroes, she never really rises above just being at best a silent passenger and at worst an anchor around the awesome avatars and Minds dealing with the situation. The author creates 2 characters that I thought had great potential and then bafflingly ignores, abandons of kills off without any further development. One is a really neat bodyguard android that has a flaw in his systems and thinks it is living in a simulation. I thought that was a promising premise. he does one heroic deed, then spends the rest of time asleep and finally get woken up to be killed off immediately. The second was one of the Minds, Caconym, one of the few which are actually more than just a silly name and a bunch of bold letters on the page, that gets a little bit of interesting character development at first and then completely disappears.<br /><br />There is a third character worth noting that would no doubt be in a tie with Jar Jar Binks as one of the silliest creations in sci-fi dom. It is a 'familiar' named Pyan. We never really understand if it is a pet, a tolerant reincarnated second cousin, a machine or what. Itis a small carpet-like thing whose sole addition to the story is to have 2-3 word non-sequiturs. Why is it there at all? why should we care?<br /><br />If you have never read a book by this author, do NOT start with this one, or you will probably never pick up another one and his earlier works are well-worth the read. [[ASIN:B007K4K8YC Surface Detail (Culture)]] is a great story that deals with deep and interesting issues like virtual slavery and torture. It is well-written and the Minds play a good role but are not the flawless excessively and annoyingly sarcastic Gods they play in this book.<br /><br />I look forward to Mr. Banks going back to writing books that will make me savor every page and sadden me when I reach the end rather than this one that made me skip pages and wonder when it would finally end.

B00004Y3OU|1.0|The DVD was not available for use with our DVD player.  It was foreign or for other countries usage.  Very disappointed that it did not state this when I ordered it.<br />Love the movie and wanted it but was concerned to re order.
B00887490Y|4.0|This is a raw look at a dying town that's been hit by a series of mysterious disappearances. Children have been vanishing practically out from under their parents' noses. We see the fear piling on top of the economic depression that has struck this town. There are the cars up on blocks in front yards full of junk - the suspicious, careful exchanges among the patrons of the local diner - and the general bitterness that's settling like volcanic ash over the town.<br /><br />After some twists and turns, this movie does provide a resolution to the mystery, albeit a rather improbable and partial one. Along the way, you're sometimes not sure if you're being projected into a dream or if you've just been taken to another level of stark reality.<br /><br />However, it's not the overall plot that's really important here. It's the atmosphere that draws you in, and individual harrowing scenes, such as the town nurse's grueling pursuit of the snatcher's van.<br /><br />Above all, I appreciated \\"Tall Man\\" for its courage in photographing women as they look in real life, rather than as the finished products of Hollywood make-up departments. The women featured in this film look out at us, unpainted, unvarnished - raw in their emotion - and therefore singularly beautiful.

B0043JDUNS|3.0|I'll start off by saying I love comics. I own them, I watch every cartoon and movie about them (within reason), even down to Voltron. Yes Voltron.<br /><br />The loved the first Iron Man. It was a good and fun movie that launched this franchise. This one however, I'm not a big fan of. Lots of action and humor, but it was just good. Not great, not bad either.<br /><br />Should you spend a couple of hours watching it? If you have Netflix or Instant Video, sure go for it. Its free. I wouldn't suggest you invest in buying it however.<br /><br />I can go into a lot of details about Plot, and stupid things in there, but take it from an Iron Man fan that its just Meh and not worth more than few bucks.

B009HV2JT8|4.0|This was an excellent vampire movie.  I read reviews that said it's not close to the book...who cares?  This movie was action packed, plausable (as plausable as a vampire movie can be), and very well done.  I plan on adding this to my collection right next to Van Helsing and Underworld.
B0096PAA6E|3.0|This CD is mastered so loud it nearly blew up my cars speakers the first time my iPod shuffled to one of its songs.  I'm disappointed that such a talented artist was given this kind of treatment on a release.<br /><br />Other than that, there are some good songs on this new Gary Clark Jr. CD.  \\"You Saved Me\\" is the stand out track for me.  \\"Travis County\\" and \\"The Life\\" are terrible.
B00622B3MY|2.0|Pixar has rivaled, even surpassed the best that Disney, Dreamworks, and Blue Sky Studios has to offer. The only studio that can rival it in brilliant, smart, fun, family-friendly cartoons is perhaps Studio Ghibli.<br /><br />But Cars 2 is Pixar's first misstep. An unnecessary sequel with little humor, cliched characters, poor voicework from Larry the Cable Guy and Owen, and lots and lots of \\"cheese\\".<br />It's one of those mindless parodies of James Bond that has to come along once in a while.<br /><br />Having said that, kids love this movie, and I'm sure they don't care about plot holes, poor characters, and Duex et Machinas!<br /><br />In summary: Cars 2 is a lemon, but KID'S WON'T CARE at all! They'll love it!
0439023521|4.0|I purchased this book after hearing so much about it, and I began reading it to my sons on a long car ride.  Soon the entire family was captivated by the story and every one of us wanted to keep going, until I was losing my voice.  My sons still go back and read it over and over.  While the second and third books in the trilogy were good, this one was great.  It deals with some very dark and disturbing ideas while allowing the main characters to maintain their humanity.
B00005JNS0|4.0|Nobody makes cartoons like Pixar!<br />If The Incredibles, Finding Nemo, Up, Toy Story, and Wall-E aren't the greatest computer-animated films ever made, blending humor, heart, and smart entertainment, then I'll eat my hat!<br /><br />Cars could also be added to the list, as it seems that young boys between the age of 3-7 cannot STOP watching it! However, when all of the above films are 5 star triumphs, Cars drives smoothly into a 4 star spot.<br /><br />The reason: Cars is a STRICTLY American film. It's set in America (the most American part of America) and has all-American characters.<br />Living abroad, I can tell you that it does not have as large an appeal to foreign audiences.<br /><br />However it makes up for that with some of the most memorable characters (Lighting McQueen, Mater), family-friendly humor, and some roaring racing sequences!<br /><br />An excellent cartoon for the whole family!
B00866H7SS|4.0|I liked this book but found myself comparing it to Fifty Shades of Grey constantly. It was goofed in its own right but I think I needed a bigger gap between reading the two. I did find the relationship with Gideon and Eva intriguing but I also found myself hating him at times. I am looking forward to the last book and this bizarre attraction

I have to say I loved reading this book and cannot wait to read the rest. This is not your ideal story of romance by far it keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering where the relationship between Christian and Ana is going to go next!
B009KHDT0C|2.0|I am a HUGE fan of the original TV soap opera Dark Shadows.  It aired from 1966 to 1971 and was groundbreaking for daytime television.  I used to hurry home from school to watch Dark Shadows.  It was American Gothic with brooding atmosphere and that famous spooky music.  It was not played for laughs.<br /><br />Fast forward to this lame attempt to cash in on Dark Shadow's good name.  It should never have happened.  Johnny Depp's Barnabus Collins was ridiculous in the white pancake makeup.  It was not funny, even though it tried to be.
B0030B0S2Q|5.0|In addition to the masterful acting and great performances, I really have to credit the writer(s) of this script with the important philisophical and societal statement they make about the future psychopathic behavior of the privatized corporation controlling deep-space exploration and operations.<br /><br />What we see portrayed in the film is really horrific. That a for profit company could master the science of manipulating human beings, duplicating them, and treating them like robots.  And making those robots think and feel they are human, only to violate, crush and shatter the existence of each and every one, on schedule, without end, from here to eternity.<br /><br />There is a seemingly endless list of the evil and psychopathic behavior the modern corporation is capable of and actively pursues and accomplishes.  Most of these were categorized neatly and convincingly in the documentary \\"The Corporation\\" in 2004.  But the scary and probable future evolution of this evil in society is chillingly and effectively portrayed in this fictional film.<br /><br />- a robot with an all too advanced human interaction (custom designed emoticon faces and voice tones, no less) specifically designed to manipulate a human so completely as to isolate them from the rest of humanity and micromanage them to a optimal production point from their birth to their death<br />- a mass produced human droid mix making individual REAL human beings irrelevant.  Why use real human beings, or give them any shot at these positions when robots are so much safer, cheaper, more consistent and of course, most importantly, more obedient and expendable?<br />- A completely manufactured life story and identity in a series of videos, and other stimuli, to hypnotize a human like being into thinking and feeling real when they are not.<br /><br />The level of psychopathy and evil described here and portrayed in the movie is so massive, so unthinkable, it is really quite stunning.<br />But at the point near the end of the film that you catch on that he's not really human, he's not really going home, this has all been an expertly manufactured charade, for the sake of production and profit, you feel spiritually violated, disgusted and horrified at the inhumanity corporations have made us collectively capable of.<br /><br />Folks, this is a scary and all too realistic future glimpse into our society, the way it is and the way it is headed with corporations running things with unchecked power.  If humans are irrelevant for space exploration and fuel missions, why stop there?  What's to say that what was going on down on earth during the same time period of that film wasn't even scarier?  What other professions, functions, geographical regions, etc. did corporations (or in our current tense WILL corporations) decide individual humanity doesn't or shouldn't have a role in and shove us aside?<br /><br />What if it's decided that more perfectly manipulated and manufactured humans are the only ones fit to serve in Congress, to be policemen, to be teachers?  And each one with an iphone in their pocket, and an earpiece talking to them with Gerty's voice, guiding them along the perfectly optimal corporate manipulated path to make their makers rich?<br /><br />This also brings to mind the movie \\"Surrogates\\" with Bruce Willis.  Gee, if we can all be perfect, better, and invincible, living through a robot who can be or look like anyone we want, why leave home, why leave bed?  Just let THEM do it all for us!<br /><br />Modern technology has accomplished some awesome things, but we are on the threshold with run-amok technology with no limits and no checks, of losing our humanity, our privacy, the quality of our lives, and genuine freedom.<br /><br />This film helped give an excellent glimpse into that scary future, and I hope among the other revered qualities of the film, this topic and that glimpse are discussed and taken seriously.<br /><br />Oh and on an artistic note, the musicscore by Clint Mansell is the perfect musical accompaniment to the insanity the main character is put through.  A seemingly progressive upbeat piano melody, reminiscent of hard work and progress, haunted and interrupted by occasional off key aberrations signifying the insanity of the situation, eventually overtaken by the spooky space tones, signifying the realization of being perfectly controlled, isolated and eventually discarded.  Bravo.

B0016492BW|4.0|Well, having been a fan of this film for a long time and through different DVD and now Blu-ray copies i must say that the movie does look better yes, BUT this is a \\"CUT\\" version and that is my main complaint.  The Blu-ray edition finds the mistaken beginning of \\"DENTIST ON THE JOB\\" REMOVED!  To be a true edition of the film and a \\"complete\\" edition this should not happen!  Why for many years over several VHS and Multiple DVD's present it in it's original form only to cut the original beginning completely from the movie?  I mean it was ok in the ultimate editions and such on the remasters to (in my opinion since it sounds very slightly different) re-dub narration, but to remove part of the movie?  Who OK'd this?!?!?!

B002VH7P4O|5.0|I have the Beatles catalogue or portions of ...... in every audiophile form that it has ever been released ..... early 60's mono and stereo recordings, various British, German and Japanese recordings from the 60's through to this decade and now this format.<br /><br /> I came upon the release of this USB release a couple of years ago.  I was extremely skeptical.  How could the Beatles catalogue possibly sound better on USB  ....... particularly since I had experienced it so thoroughly on all previous formats from many diverse sources ?  I firmly believed that this USB release could not be superior.<br /><br />Well, over the past couple of years I kept returning to a variety of reviews testifying to it's sonic superiority.  I gradually started to consider it's purchase.  I convinced myself that even if it did not sound better .....  the green apple with a USB stick as it's core sure looked great ..... and ..... that in the very least ..... it was bond to become a collectors item of some note. I finally took the plunge a few months back now ...... and ...... I have not ceased to be amazed by the incredible sonics that this little green wonder produces ..... on my desktop and my dedicated stereo system.  I am still beginning to hear things that I had never heard before ...... minute details ......  rich textures ......  fantastic decays ..... and ..... the background is totally black allowing the Beatles wonderful, timeless art to come forward in to a much larger and richer soundstage.<br /><br /> I thought that the Mono Masters on CD were great and I loath the CD format ...... I am a vinyl guy ...... returning to vinyl 10 years ago after having listened exclusively to CD for 17 years.  Now, I am very curious about the upcoming vinyl releases pressed from 24-bit, 192 kHz files.<br /><br />Will they be better ?  I really don't know. They certainly are getting ..... as can be expected .... a big pre-release push. If they are better ..... I will, most likely,  be gettingthose as well.  However, at this time ..... it is hard to imagine that they can be better.<br /><br />In any event ..... if you purchase this little green wonder ..... you are, very likely, not to be disappointed.

B005721W9O|5.0|I am a Star Trek fan, and I had read that this movie was an outrage to all that is Star Trek.<br /><br />I have to disagree with that. I felt that it took an interesting turn. What would happen if actors had to LIVE the roles they play on TV? (okay, there was a Twilight Zone episode that asked the same question, but it wasn't funny.)<br /><br />It also begs an interesting question... since our TV transmissions DO go out into space... what would real aliens think of them? Would they know that so much of it is fiction? Would aliens even have fiction in their lives?<br /><br />What would they think of game shows? Comedies? Cartoons? Would they be able to tell the difference between a news show and a political opinion show? Maybe we should be more careful about what goes on the air!<br /><br />Back on earth we tend to believe what we see on TV, and a Star Trek Universe looks pretty inviting (except there are no bathrooms on Starships). We also tend to think that actors behave in life like their characters. This is sometimes a point of contention for movie stars who are trying to shop for groceries! \\"Galaxy Quest\\" explores these issues in a gentle but touching way.<br /><br />Here we look at the \\"reality\\" of a sci-fi fantasy universe. Only, it's just as unreal, but the characters have to take some of it seriously because they are stuck in it. Its like looking at the reflection of a mirror. Wonderful stuff!<br /><br />The characters, well, they're just so funny and sometimes so sweet. They could not have a better cast!<br /><br />The film actually does play with our emotions. Although it is a comedy, some of the characters die (not who we expect) and it is very touching and sad. Some characters are tortured, and that is painful to watch. It's because as silly as everyone is, we like them and feel for them. When the \\"chief engineer\\" gets the Beryllium Sphere working again, he calls his team for a group hug.

B008GVD6D8|4.0|I enjoyed this book much more than I thought I would, and found I didn't want to put it down. As a fifty shades fan, I was a little disappointed by the crossfire novels to start with, but as I say, I did like this one, and found myself eager to discover what happened next, after the story finally took off from seemingly copying the fifty shades trilogy. I will be recommending this book to everyone I know.
B004EPYZSK|2.0|I was intrigued by the title of this film because it combined the Wild West with Sci Fi. How could it go wrong? Westerns are fun. Sci Fi is fun.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I don't remember much about this film except that Daniel Craig had something stuck to his arm, Harrison Ford was angry about something, the aliens looked like rabid dogs or something, and there were space ships that looked like dragon flies on steroids.<br /><br />The problem was that I fell asleep about 30 minutes into the movie and woke up 30 minutes before the end.<br /><br />I tried watching it again the next day, and the same thing happened.<br /><br />So, I guess I could call this a good sleeper.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I was very impressed by not only the quality of their music, but the wide range of genres. I will definately be looking forward to any new CD's they bring us.
078689136X|5.0|Best if you read all books in the series.  Great reading. A little romance with a<br />detective story. Hard to put down once you start reading.
1401216676|5.0|I really enjoyed The Killing Joke. The story and artwork are really well done, but the thing that struck me most about this comic is the color work by John Higgins. I love all the bright colors like pink, purple, yellow and green used in almost every panel (except for the flashbacks). It gives it an almost trippy and psychedelic feel that fits the story perfectly and that's what really makes this comic for me. If you are like me and are wanting to collect only the best Batman stories, like The Dark Knight Returns, Year One, The Long Halloween, Dark Victory, etc., then this is definitely one to add to your collection.
0786891416|5.0|Its great to know the people you read about.  Need to get all four books before<br />starting to read the series.  It was great reading and being able to go right to<br />the next book without waiting for them to arrive at the house was outstanding.<br /> The two characters are great together. Can't wait to start the fourth book.
B009NQKXYK|1.0|That was just about the worst sci-fi movie I've ever seen.  The special effects were great, but that's about it.  The plot was awful and horribly slow - like watching paint dry.  Skip this movie!
B0014DQSGW|4.0|I needed a light movie to watch and this one was perfect.  Sandra Bullock it always a treat to watch.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|The Marwear item I purchased for my new KindelFire HD is great.  Love the color and the ease for use. I would recommend anyone to purchase any items needed for their Kindel Fire from Amazon.com. Easy...peasey!!
B009SJ47XA|5.0|I've been a fan of this show since the beginning, which was only last year. Unlike when I was in elementary school, I admit I'm not big on anything horror related anymore: it's either all shock value and no plot, or tasteless. But this show has an amazing story line, plenty of twists and turns and surprises in addition to the scary elements that many crave. The premiere of this season, just like the last, did not fail to impress me.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|creative and fun. good job Rovio.  only bad thing is the in-app purchases for inventions. this is a really great app
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is awesome and very addicting the game is very fast pace and fun. My husband and three grandsons play it all the time. I have it downloaded on my ipad, Kindel and smart phone.

B004V5A7K8|4.0|Well worth free, and I would certainly pay a buck or two for it. It's not the best Breakout rendition, but it is quite well done. Give it a try.
B008Q09K2U|3.0|Nelson de Mille has long been one of my favourite authors and I find it sad that to me his novels have become more formulaic and commercial as time has gone on.  Two of the major attractions of his work in the past have been his characterisations and wit, both of which I found markedly lacking in this novel.  Fast paced and plot driven, admittedly still reasonably entertaining, but a marked come-down from his original works.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is easy to use and to read.  The best calculator app for Kindle that I found. I love it.
B006VJMZXY|5.0|I loved this whole series. Really interesting to re-read the same piece of history from the differing perspectives of the women involved.
B008NAFU9A|5.0|Rebecca Hamilton's writing always flows. This book was a treat. It's very short, as the description says, so the story and romance are really compact, but Hamilton made it beautiful and believable.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely adore Pinterest. It is hands down the most frequently used app on my kindle. In fact, Pinterest is the only social network I use frequently.
1610454812|5.0|Fearless is a great story about a person who doesnt know how to quit. Adam overcame some adversity when it came to addicition and pushed forward with his life and his goal to become one of the most elite war fighters in the history of the teams. It was nice to know his human side. The side of him that is caring and loyal and how he showed real commitment to his wife & children and SEAL brothers. I bought the audio book and really enjoyed it and then bought the hardcover book and got to put a face on the people in the story. The story is full of all kinds of emotion. You will laugh, you will experience pride for Adam's successes, and hurt when he has moments of weakness. You will hurt for him when he is injured and you will admire him for his faith in GOD and his willingness to make time to teach kids in Sunday school. I know, it dont make sense for an elite warrior such as Adam to to be teaching Sunday school, but if you read the book and get to undersand Adam...its makes perfect sense. I can honestly say that after reading the book i wanted to be a better person. This was one of the most inspirational books i have ever read. I have got into books like LONE SURVIVOR and AMERICAN SNIPER and THE RED CIRCLE, which are outstanding books with stories of great men doing amazing things, but this one strikes a different nerve. These men are truely giants and should be looked up to by all of us, but they are all the kind of guys that would rather go un-noticed and remain humble low-key. They have served our country and some like Adam have paid the highest price, leaving behind family and friends and deserve to be remembered and respected and NEVER forgotten.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|final fantasy titles have always been top notch and worth every penny ever since their first one on the nes. i gladly dropped the cash after playing it on a friend's device. this is a real game. anyone who is weary of the price can go back to farmville or angry birds.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|When my pal, Sheryl, showed me this game on her Kindle Fire, her fingers flew through the first 4 or 5 games.  It couldn't be simpler - connect dots of the same color until you fill up all the spaces in the grid.  The first board is 5 x 5 and I zoomed through all 30 levels with a perfect score.  At 6 x 6 there were a couple of levels that I didn't connect up perfectly on the first try.  As the boards moved up - 7 x 7, 8 x 8, 9 x 9 - it took more tries, but I finished them off in short order.  That was the first 'pack' of 150 levels.  In the next two packs, I ended up with 4 levels that I couldn't crack for days, but I finally got them done.  Now I'm two thirds of the way through the 'Jumbo Pack' - 10 x 10 to 14 x 14 boards.  These are tough and you have to be really creative to fill the board completely.  I've been playing for 2 or 3 weeks and I hope that when I finally solve all of the last levels in the Jumbo Pack that I'll be able to find more packs.  This is a free game and I'd pay for a key and new packs in a heartbeat.  Even my mom and my mother-in-law have tried it and enjoyed playing the game.  I'm going to have to get back at Sheryl for introducing me to such an addictive way to use up all my spare time.
1423140605|5.0|Leo wasn't sure what he expected to happen. Sure, it would have been nice to fly into the Roman camp upon the Argo II with the Roman's missing hero, Jason, and other members of Camp Halfblood to be welcomed with open arms. Instead, everyone looked at them like they were starting the next world war. But that wasn't Leo's fault. He couldn't help it if the Mother Earth, the goddess Gaea, was still bent on revenge. Leo also didn't like how this quest seemed to be putting him into impossible situations. Leo feels completely in control around machines. But why does he feel like he has no control over what will happen in the future?<br /><br />Piper has seen the future and she doesn't like it. It always ends the same --- Jason, Percy and her end up dying in a dark and abandoned cavern. Piper recognizes that her charm-speaking abilities can help her out in a pinch, but how do you charm-speak your way out of death? Plus, it's not like Jason would be grateful or anything if Piper saved his life. He seems extremely distant to her and somehow locked in a battle of wills with Percy. Piper wasn't sure what to expect on this quest, but it sure isn't turning out the way she thought it would.<br /><br />Percy had enjoyed his time as member of the Roman demigod camp, but boy was he happy when Annabeth showed up with Leo, Piper, and Jason on the Argo II. That happiness lasted for about a second as, inexplicably, the Argo II started firing on the Roman camp. Percy and his friends managed to escape, but now Percy is feeling the weight of two potential wars on his shoulders. Not only does he need to stop Gaea from destroying the world, but Percy also has to think about the Romans attacking his beloved Camp Halfblood and destroying all the Greek demigods. Good thing Annabeth is at his side, although if his dreams are telling him anything, that won't last for long.<br /><br />Annabeth knew from the beginning that the quest to stop Gaea would basically mean certain death. Ever since the Roman and Greek demigod camps became aware of each other, the gods seemed to have split personalities. They were essentially worthless in trying to fight against the Mother Earth. Not only that, but Annabeth's mother, Athena, had told Annabeth to avenge her. Normally Annabeth would gladly comply, but there was just one little problem --- every demigod that attempted to avenge Athena had perished trying. Time, as always, is running out and everyone working together may not be enough.<br /><br />THE HEROES OF OLYMPUS series has grown in depth and complexity, and Rick Riordan has handled it like a pro. There are many characters to juggle, but everyone has an important role and all their actions and storylines fit together seamlessly. The one aspect I've enjoyed immensely about this series is that Riordan has chosen to have multiple narrators. Each one brings a breath of fresh air to whatever is happening and their unique perspectives keep things interesting. And don't worry, there is much, much more to come!<br /><br />Reviewed by Benjamin Boche
0385344325|5.0|Another Reacher novel. I like them all but I would rate this one somewhere in the middle. As always a good, quick read. Its nice to read about Reacher in the Army again.
B008KMHFJY|2.0|I liked the way the story got moving quickly and set up the characters with a hint that there was more to them. However, like other reviewers, I found the violence a real turn-off, especially because Travis' behaviour has all the hallmarks of a wife beater. Terrible story line for a YA audience to then normalise his violence and possessiveness and make it seem ok - it's not, even though she inexplicably, repeatedly torments him.<br /><br />Ultimately Abby and Travis are too dramatic and self absorbed for my taste - can you imagine spending time with them? What a tedious and selfish pair they are, treating treat their friends like indentured servants. And the ending... hard to get there but it was worth it for just how inappropriate it was.<br /><br />IRL advice - if a man smashes up a room because he can't find you and viciously assaults someone for talking to you, it's not because he really cares, it's because he's an insecure, violent narcissist who will make your life a misery and most likely turn that violence on you. Run away as fast as you can!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|it is worth the $2 for sure. there are no glitches and great graphics! i cant wait for the sequel.
B00009RDG9|1.0|What a waste of 2 hours!  If I were Tommy Lee Jones (the only reason we purchased this in the first place), I'd consider this a stain on my r&eacute;sum&eacute;.  The acting (even by Jones), the dialogue, and the direction were all sub-par.  \\"Rambo\\" rip-off scenes were all over the place.  (Only, they weren't even as well-executed as those in the aforementioned series, if that tells you anything.)
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|if you like angry birds you will love bad piggies it is really fun because you can use your imagination and creativity in the game
B004W2UBYW|4.0|This was a well done, clear view of Steve Jobs.  He was not idealized or vilified-just presented as is.  Kudos to Mr. Jobs for allowing this kind of biography.  Most biographical subjects don't see themselves clearly so object to even handed views.  Perhaps this clear view was his most attractive characteristic.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|fun to play so far.  I really like the hidden objects. they are nice and the puzzles are fun too.

B0077SGMXM|5.0|Like many others, I'm hooked. I have spent a bit too much time playing this, but I have enjoyed it all. Only once in quite a few games did it freeze. Not enough of an issue to complain. Thanks for the cool app.
B0001US62I|5.0|If you have not seen this movie and want to, which you are recommended to do, see it for the performance of Robert DeNiro. De Niro has developed a style of acting over the years, which, while otherwise excellent, is recognizable, and at times detracts from the character he is attempting to portray on film. Sometimes he appears to be unable to shed those New York mannerisms, inflections, which, while he remains one of the major actors of this generation, an audience viewer can spot a mile away.<br /><br />In his portrayal of Louis Cypher, all those mannerisms and traits, all those de Niro-isms, are gone. De Niro's character is bone-chilling, blood-curdling, and eerie. This was a part in which he apparently totally and completely immersed himself, both off and on camera. Alan Parker, the brilliant director of this film, has said that de Niro was so unapproachable and eerie on the set that he decided to just allow him to direct himself when the cameras started. De Niro himself says that his portrayal of Cypher was his imitation of Martin Scorcese. If true, that comment is enough to change one's opinion of Scorcese.<br /><br />This is not to say that the supporting cast doesn't measure up. On the contrary. O'Rourke gives one of his best performances; Bonet also gives a break-out performance. The other characters, though minor, are convincing and strong.<br /><br />Filmed on location, Parker does a great service to give us a glimpse of what New Orleans looked like prior to Hurricane Katrina. One can't help but wonder what neighborhoods portrayed in the movie are still standing.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Robert De Niro, you will love this film.
B005PK56TA|4.0|Overall, I really liked this season.  The actors did a great job delivering their characters.  It became addicting watching the episodes.  I think I watched the whole season in a few days!  The writing of this show is also very good although there are some scenes that were probably not necessary.  It became very sexual and graphic with some parts.  I guess the gore and sex goes with the horror territory.  It probably would have been worse on HBO or Showtime.  Despite that, still love the show, even so much more than the second season!  Wished the writers would have continued with the original storyline and cast for the second season.  : (
B0025X4OYI|5.0|The spectrum of musical styles are rounded up in Ray Charles' way. He pulls, pushes and twists the rhythms and phrasing to produce \\"new\\" pieces that are stamped \\"Ray Charles\\".
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|Being a Blu-ray of FOX, I expected a better quality in the presentation!<br />(technical qualities of the film and disc are 10)
B000062X90|5.0|at first i wasn't going to write a review because there is already over 80 reviews so why bother.  then i saw this is for sale at $5.99!  and i had to write saying if you're into guitar rock, great harmonies and intricate riffs, this cd is a must own.  the remastering is surprisingly good and the bonus live material sounds great, with great performances.  i saw this band several times during the early 70s and were blown away by their performances;  especially on my favorite song \\"Phoenix\\".  great liner notes are added to this package.  the bonus material is from a promotional ep, \\"Live from Memphis\\".  anyway, i really can't find any fault in this cd.  and at it's price, it's well worth buying.  you won't be disappointed.
140120841X|5.0|Nice print and great gift for someone who loves graphics novels.  My girlfriend loved this novel so much she read it in one sitting with out &#34;messing&#34; up the pages.  Great collectible.

B009VB97EY|1.0|I do not get the hype over this movie.  My husband I rented this last night thinking it would be kind of cheesy and fun and get us in the mood for date night.  Boy were we wrong.  The characters were unlikeable, and we didn't really have a reason to root for any of them.  The dancers were all drug addicts.  The acting was horrendous.  The dancing was upbeat and fun, but all other scenes were completely depressing.  This was not the fun movie we were expecting.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I just finished reading the book, \\"Emma\\" by Jane Austen and I immediately had to watch the movie. BBC did an outstanding job with this adaptation. The character portrayals were spot on and the acting was stellar. This is probably my new favorite Jane Austen movie.
B007OWRBJK|5.0|Pete Townshend's book is a touching and authentic account<br />of his inner and outer life. Felt blessed to be included<br />in his amazing journey. Love the book and the man!
B0045XICB2|4.0|It's part of the saga. U have to keep up before the final movie. Same characters  No big surprises  and, they finally had a change in scenery
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Fantastic - Cornwell wrote another spectacular story.  Must read if you have enjoyed other books written by this author.  Read in one sitting.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I couldn't put the book down and I'm on my 2nd time rereading it! I wish there were more books with Christian grey
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Beautiful Disaster is a beautifully written book.  I couldn't put it down and was sad when it was over... It was that good.  It was suspenseful, funny, dramatic... Everything a good book should be.  There were a few bad reviews that I had read before purchasing the book... I'm glad I didn't let those sway me away from the book as I didn't find them to be the least bit true.  I anxiously await Walking DIsaster.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Prior to purchasing the eBook, I was a huge fan of the Game of Thrones tv series on HBO. After one season of the series, I was hooked so I decided to give the books a try and have not been the least bit disappointed. I am still on the first book as each of the books are long, but I have no doubt I will continue trucking until the very end!
B00000889Y|4.0|I can't think of another band quite like the Cramps. They were a fusion of rockabilly, punk, rock and whatever else that came to mind at the time. Totally raw and uninhibited, wild and fun. I feel lucky like that I got to see them in concert once (a show in San Francisco, with the Method Actors opening; great pairing!), and I still crack a big smile when I think about the Cramps live concert clip in the film \\"Urrgghh: A Music War.\\" What's he doing with that microphone???!!! They were a brilliant band. And oh yeah, this compilation, \\"Off the Bone.\\" Very good for the most part, but I find myself skipping a few of the weak remakes of songs like \\"Lonesome Town\\" and \\"Fever.\\" Their version of \\"Surfin' Bird,\\" however, is killer! Many other fun, rockin' tracks on here too, including classics like \\"Human Fly,\\" Garbageman,\\" Drug Train\\" and \\"Goo Goo Muck.\\" But perhaps my favorite track on here is the final one, a live version of \\"Good Taste.\\" Love that guitar; makes me shake and shimmy every time. I'll say it again: there was no other band like the Cramps. Enjoy this music!
B00005JLEU|5.0|This movie is just enchanting.  The animation and music kind of made me tear up when I first watched it.  I can't really say what specifically makes it great, but I love the surreal story and the artistry in the music and the animation.  It's my favorite Myazaki film.
B00003CXRM|5.0|As Delmar says in the movie, \\"Come on in boys the water is fine.\\" Yes, it is both from a spiritual point of view and as the best all-around movie that I have ever viewed. This is a story of conversion. There were many. The most dramatic conversion is near the end when Everett, who is like our modern day pagans, sees the prophecy of the blind old man come true. The blind man could see, and  unlike most secularist, like Everett, who cannot and will not.  One senses if this story would continue that Pete and Delmar would live out their lives peacefully, but  Everett will \\"back-slide\\" because he will always struggle with matters of Truth and matters of Everett.<br /><br />Paul Clark
B000L53D4O|5.0|I bought this second hand, and after a rocky start, this is my son's favorite toy.<br /><br />When we first bought this, my son couldn't use it very well, since when he pushed it, it just wasn't sturdy enough. He was around 10 months when we bought it. After about a month of using it while crawling on his knees and pushing it, he finally was stable enough on his feet, to stay standing/walking while pushing it. Now the moment we set him down on the floor, this is the toy he goes for. He will spend hours, going back and forth between practicing walking by himself and then pushing this while he walks. He loves to ram it into things, including the dog, but since its so lightweight, nobody gets hurt.<br /><br />This is definitely great for when your little one gets more stable on their feet.
B007Z8ZKS2|4.0|Really good book and made me cry..... makes you think about life in general ... hits home hard... try it you will love it
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I used to collect DVDs, but when Blu's came out I pretty much felt cheated.  I have been extremely selective on my purchasing of Blu's.  The Alien Anthology has all the bells and whistles!  I am really impressed at the level of work that went into its production.  The case and contents look fantastic.  The features and content of the Blu's is beyond impressive.  I highly recommend it as an addition to your collection.  It is fun to watch the director and extended cuts.  It is everything Aliens...the good, the bad, and the ugly..lol
B007JMW46U|5.0|I'm only on page 20 or so, but I'm already loving this book. Very well written (obviously) and I've been dragged into a great story very early in the book, so hooray!
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Keep in mind tha I am a big fan of Bob Dylan. That said, I think that \\"Tempest\\" is an album created in the same style as \\"Modern Times\\". If you took a liking to \\"Modern Times\\", the new album will please you as well. The way I see it, the songs on both albums remind me of songs written in the 30's or 40's. Except for the fact that they're new albums by Bob Dylan today.\\"Tempest\\" is one of those rare albums that are so good, that you can just push the start button on your chosen medium (CD player or Itunes or what have you) and let it run all the way through.No irritating og boring fillers here. Only supercool top Bob Dylan quality all the way. Another album from one of the truly great ones.
B000I52LUO|5.0|Fantastic psychological thriller with Christian Bale doing what he does best:  amazing acting.<br />Bit of trivia:  I was shocked to find this movie was actually filmed in Spain.  It's supposed to be set in a west coast City, and as a Southern Californian, this sure fooled me.<br /><br />Great script, acting, directing, music - you name it, this movie's got it.  If you're a fan of psychological thrillers like I am, you are sure to agree this is one of the better ones.  A+ from me.
B0089AF2DS|5.0|There is a reason why they gained a following.  It has been their progression from another Doom and Sludge Metal band to true musicians, writing the music that makes sense to them. Reading interviews reading up to the release, and listening to the composition of Blue, no one should have been surprised or caught off guard by Yellow/Green.  Musically, it flows wonderfully. One of my favorite releases by anyone in a long time.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|My friend met Adams family at one of the seal compounds and recommended this book to me. I remember it coming out but after his recommendation, I bought it that night. It was finished a week later. I already want to read it again. The title of this review are the first words that come to mind that describe the book. The spirit of Adam Brown will amaze you and to see the hardships and adversity he defeated is simply incredible and not to mention inspiring. Read this book if you want a good read.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|Once again, this is another great Jack Reacher novel -- very intriguing plot, lots of action, and just can't get enough of him.
B006RXQ2CY|5.0|This was a compelling movie about the royal life.  Mirren wore the crown exquisitely with her commanding performance.  At times funny, then other times sad.  This is the second time I have watched the movie, and I enjoyed it all over again.  The queen rules!
B00866H7SS|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK COULDNT;T WAIT TO GET PART 2 THANK YOU SLYVIA GRAY I LOVED THE STORY LINE IT WAS BETTER THEN FIFTY SHADES
1449410243|3.0|For those of you who read The Oatmeal and already own \\"5 Very Good Reasons to Punch a Dolphin in the Mouth\\", this book is a little disappointing to me. I thought, similar to the last book, the content would be new and old comics from The Oatmeal's site. I'm just letting you know that the comics are ALL about cats. ALL cats. Which I don't really think was made clear since the last book was not all about dolphins.<br />Overall it's pretty good. But not my favorite. It kind of feels like Matthew Inman was rushing to get this out because a lot jokes for the new comics are repetitive.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The ending is great. Definitely recommend all three books! I couldn't put them down! Mockingjay was my favorite of the three!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|The story flows perfectly through-out the book and keeps the pages turning rather quickly.<br />The characters are heartfelt and yet full of angst that brought me back to my years in high school. Highly recommended!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is my first review; I don't ordinarily submit reviews. I enjoyed this book so much that I decided to do so.<br /><br />First, it was a &#34;seductive&#34; read. I found myself thinking about the story and looked forward to returning to read more.<br /><br />Once I finished the novel, I continued to think about it (extremely unusual for me). I am a voracious reader and had proceeded  onward to read another 2 or 3 books. I kept finding myself drawn to this book.<br /><br />I read it again, registering nuances that I'd missed the first time. I thought that I was done, and put it aside.<br /><br />However, the siren's song continued, luring me for yet another read, where I once again found material I missed.<br /><br />I found this book to be a great read, with enough complexity of characters and thought-provoking issues to keep the reader well-engaged.
B008EQIEWS|3.0|Then movie was okay, but not nearly as good as the first one. It does make for a good rainy day movie though :-)
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I love this app so much. it works great and dose not lag AT ALL. It helps me sleep and take Mg mind off things. But you have to download sounds if you want them. I would recommend this app to anybody who has trouble sleeping........
B006LSZECO|4.0|I recommend this book to mystery lovers.  Many twists and turns. I took me a little time to get into the book but once I did, I did not want to put it down. Not sure about the ending though....
B0086700CM|4.0|I love how you can buy new charecters and boosts without real money but coins you collect in the game!!! But on my kindle fire if takes FOREVER to load and start the game. Other then that I like this game......
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I couldn't put this book down until I reached the outcome.  This book alternated between past/present storylines.  I became so concerned for the main character with her past abusive situation that I had to skip the chapters concerning her present life to discover what happened to her in the past.  I recommended this book to several book clubs and of course, family members.  Haven't heard back from the book clubs - yet.  My family members however, felt it was an excellent read.  My Mom said, \\"I am reading it as the author intended and not skipping chapters.  It is very hard to do, but I will do it.\\"  Enough said - I cheated.
030758836X|1.0|After reading so many good reviews for this book, I decided to give it a try. IT WAS TERRIBLE. I don't understand how two people could be so psychotic and manipulative. DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON THIS TERRIBLE BOOK!!!!!!
B007FG9LIE|2.0|I was very upset at the extremely vulgar language in the book. Completely unnecessary  it ruined the book for me. I think there should be a rating guide to determine if I would purchase. I would not have purchased if I had known the language used.
B00992CF6W|5.0|great job but it needs minecarts and rollercoasters to get to your houses to put in house for transportation come on
B003YFIYKG|5.0|Great read, helps set the scene of what happened to all the races of tyria and most importantly the culture and animosity between the races. A sad tale......
B000001ELR|5.0|Remastered series-Having thoroughly worn this thin on cassette back in the day, I hadn't heard it in years. Wow! Brings back memories of being stuck in rural Kentucky at the Grandparent's for that summer armed only with a single speaker cassette deck, this tape I bought with lawn mowing money, and a slew of c batteries to run the bloody thing. Never realized(by comparison)how good these tunes were. Great sound blah blah......never did understand why they reshot the album cover with Bruce-another lead guitarist that didn't play on the original recording. And the gawd-awful monochromatic brown. The blue and glowing eyes was a brilliant move visually, esp having returned from a bucket of tripe 'The Elder'.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app works very well and It is easy to change locations. An excellent app that I would highly recommend.
B003WUYRGI|3.0|Perfect naked girls facts!! Like bare, nude, naked, strip, boobies, boobs, boobie, striped, and more! Also private parts.<br /><br />  FOR BOYS ONLY<br />  Agent x
B007THA4FI|3.0|A common thread among the characters appears to be the need to cling to relationships, resentfully, for fear of being alone.  Who appears to be the happiest, most together, person in the town meets his demise early in the story. There are some funny moments but the ending is dissatisfying. Self-absorption seems to derail any chance of a life well-lived in Pagford.
B008OOYALE|5.0|this is clearly the best kindle game ever.<br /><br />this is the best kindle game I don't know what any negative is for
B0055SWM08|5.0|Peaceful yet challenging game.  sound effects not too intrusive.  Enjoyed the new move restrictions and redo options available at each level.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|i love defense games. several choices in the shop. i also like graphics. i like game creators like glu and com2us. i enjoy these two. check em out.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is a very good story taking off from the first book and I will look forward to the third book.
B000MKD9P6|4.0|Awesome, even if it is one-sided, view of the fashion world at Vogue magazine. Streep is amazing and should have received an Oscar for her performance. You should see this movie!
B009JZV466|5.0|The Good Wife is one of my favorites but I missed some episodes and am catching up.  The plot action and acting are great. Seeing it in HD was a plus. Using Amazon.com was quick and easy and I will continue to use it and recommend it to my friends.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I used alarm clock extreme while having my house remodeled to wake me each morning. It was very helpful. Thanks alarm clock extreme!
B009KHBDUU|4.0|I think they did a good job of keeping the silly campy nature of the tv show in the movie.  I really enjoyed it!
0316228532|1.0|After reading all of J.K. Rowling's books (and sometimes more than once) I became an enormous fan of hers. Ms Rowling's panache for character development in her Harry Potter series was so impressive and captivating that I couldn't wait to read her new novel Casual Vacancy. I wish that I had waited and waited and actually never bought the book. Simply put, Casual Vacancy is the worst book I have ever read. There is not once shred of goodness in this book at all. Walt Disney once said, \\"For every laugh there should be a tear.\\" Well, Casual Vacancy is nothing but tears. Even though, Ms Rowling is known for her keen sense of character development, there is not one character in the book that is likable or has any redeeming qualities, much less a character that the average reader could relate to or give empathy. I had high hopes for this book, but those hopes were dashed after about the first fifty pages. I actually thought that the more I would read, the book would get much better. Instead it became more difficult to get through and, of course, the ending was the worst. I am shocked that Ms Rowling would write such a second rate novel when her other works are first class.
B008YZXYY2|4.0|-- i like the full raucous guitar sound of n&uuml;-metal but never the lazy vocal delivery of bands like Slipknot and the like thrash, dead, doom or brutal metal... what's the point of screaming and gaging as if these 'singers' are deep-throating some big thing in their mouths? vocal remnants of Corey's foundations with Slipknot are here of course, sparely, but it's clear that his Stone Sour project has given him the right venue to develop himself as great vocalist, with much, much better full songs, musically, and as a whole-artist... Saw him in Mexico City last friday, before the Deftones and Marilyn Manson, and he was awesome, the best of the bunch, no doubt: \\"Absolute Zero\\", \\"A Rumor of Skin\\" and \\"Taciturn\\", from this new recording, close to the end of a one-hour set, were very well received highlights... if you like n&uuml;-metal, as of Godsmack or Disturbed, you will enjoy this one... very much!
B00846REIS|4.0|Very Very similar to Fifty shades of Grey..a fun easy read!!<br />Looking forward to reading the next in the series
0316228532|5.0|It must be difficult to decide to do a completely different book after receiving such acclaim for the Harry Potter series, but I think J. K. Rowling did a wonderful job.  This was completely different from Harry Potter and there is really no comparison.  This book's characters reminded me a bit of the characters in Ruth Rendall's books, though perhaps not quite as quirky.  They all had their issues and problems and even though other people may have thought certain people were a certain way or had perfect lives, we were able to see into their lives and to see the issues and problems they all were grappling with. I found it a very good read. I think a potential reader needs to put Harry Potter completely out of his or her head before starting this book and then it can be enjoyed on its own merits.  Well worth the time.
B009ZQJ1G4|2.0|Meh. If you can't find a better sci fi movie then determine how severely you need a sic fi fix. This one might be better than nothing.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|It's rare for a film execution of a novel to be anywhere close to being as good as the written tale. It's almost unheard of for a film to outshine the book that inspired it, but with incredibly insightful direction (aided of course by an excellent screenplay and solid performances from the entire cast), David Slade has done it with Eclipse. Though I've now read all the books in the Twilight saga, I'm far from a &#34; Twi-hard&#34;; I did find them reasonably entertaining, though a bit tedious and tiresome: a lot of mental thrashing before a final culmination. Eclipse was the best of the bunch and I feared its ruin once transformed to cinema (remember how Curaon destroyed HP3?), but not to worry: Slade's thorough grasp of character and story, and meticulous attention to detail makes Eclipse the movie a great roller coaster ride from its grisly start to its finish. Bella is never more likable than she is here, saying her &#34;last&#34; goodbyes to her Mom, enduring &#34;the talk&#34; with her dad (played brilliantly by Billy Burke), torn between her obsessive love for charismatic Edward and her overwhelming affection for volatile but oh-so-warm-and-vital Jacob. Standout scenes are numerous, but in addition to those aforementioned, some highly memorable moments include Jacob showing up in the school parking lot, Bella meeting the wolf pack, the Cullen's prepping for battle, Jasper's  story, and the snowstorm scene, especially the exchange between Edward and Jacob, and, of course, &#34;the kiss&#34;. With action and romance, spookiness and suspense, this one has something for everyone--including a kick-bu** soundtrack!--and can be enjoyed even if you haven't read the books.
B005UBNKZG|4.0|I'm a noob when it comes to building computers so I don't have much to add.  But I will say that while I don't have any problems with this CPU, the stock heat sink/fan doesn't keep my CPU cool and the MOBO alarm goes off regularly.  Mine will occasionally run 50 degrees Celsius plus in idle.  Save yourself some time and order an after market CPU heat sink/fan with the CPU.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game it's so fun. I mean I get on it and I can't. get off it.you shod get it:)
034580404X|5.0|Great product!
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Um...I had most of the boards completed in this version as of last night, but today my progress was completely wiped! I love the game, but this ducks!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Definitely a very good game. Challenging! But, don't. take my word for it! Try it yourself! YOU'LL. BE GLAD YOU DID!
0425263908|5.0|This book kept me enthralled right from the start.  Couldn't put it down.  I don't understand why people are bashing on it, comparing it to 50 shades.  Personally, I loved 50 shades, and I loved this book, too, and I'm glad that both were written.  And frankly this book seemed the more honest and polished of the two to me.  It's a hot emotional roller coaster of a love story with really steamy sex scenes.  What's not to love?
B0086700CM|5.0|fun and it is very fast paced and keeps you guessing after every restart you have. never the same run and nice upgrades in the store
B004LE7PCM|5.0|Sherlock Holmes is still excellent reading, despite his, its<br />age, and despite some very bad films based ont it.<br />Good English, good plots and all with a dash of sense of humour<br />who can resist it
B001CVKUO2|5.0|Amazingly deep and powerful album. Buy it now! These guys are great on this 2008 effort, and have a new one coming out soon. They are even better live.
B005ZTFPFQ|4.0|100 games for 10 dollars is a good deal, more than some more expensive atari collections. needs horizontal view, otherwise good.
B00785P2QC|3.0|It is okay. It is very similar to the Sims City cam for your PC. It is good for passing the time when you don't have your PC. You run out of energy pretty fast and have to gain investment points in order to build certain necessary buildings that help to increase your population's happiness. In fact they make you do reviews and a lot of FB post to gain some of those investment points. It takes forever to gain those points in order to move forward in the game.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|knife is pretty sturdy and thick for incase i need to split wood! its also sharp enough to shave my face. i have the knife in my backpack. emergency backpack for when i need to bug out. good knife all around
B0064NTZJO|5.0|It's undoubtedly one of the best films of the century.<br />Probably the best film about a retard since Forrest Gump.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I believe and this has increased my faith.  I have had seen evidence  of gods hand often in my life.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I was a little confused at the end. What story happened. In the beginning there is mention of an uncle that talked a lot of the sea?
B005LAJ23A|5.0|I'm not usually a fan of zombie themed entertainment, but this series is really excellent and thrilling. There are some gory parts, but definitely exciting and has had some interesting plot happenings.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|If your like me and love, passion and hot sex you'll love this book. The story line is ok. The Author knows how to describe the love scenes. Oh how I enjoy this book. I have read it twice already.
B004SBQGHS|3.0|Was great, but now crashes every time I try to open it, since the latest update, on the galaxy s2
0525478817|5.0|This is one of the best books ive ever read  it is quite a teer jerker. i fell in love with hazel and augustus from the start. it gave me a new outlook on life
B009NQKXYK|3.0|Prometheus had such great potential.  I can't describe the complete storyline without revealing too much information, but suffice it to say that the concept is a fairly unique spin on its topic.  The problem with the movie is that they tried to put too much character building into the story, and despite the effort they even fail at that.  I didn't care about any of the characters, so when things happened to them I didn't really care.  I wanted more meat in the story.  The \\"twist\\" at the very end was predictable, and I would've loved it had the movie been better; but as it stood I just shrugged my shoulders with a loud \\"Meh!\\"  Worth watching if you have the spare time and like sci-fi, but if you're looking for a great revelatory movie, this isn't it.
0316228532|3.0|I just finished this book. I bought it on September 28 and finished it on Nov 3. So, if it took me that long to read it, that means I am doing other things at reading time. Like looking up reviews of chip clips on Amazon. Which, of course,  means the book is not interesting enough to get me off the computer doing worthless activites to go and read it. Lots of characters, and I didn't really care about any of them, long and boring.... It wasn't terrible - but nothing to write home about either. I never would have picked it up if it wasn't this author. I was not expecting another Harry Potter - but it's really hard to believe this was by the same person. I would have read it no matter what - just to see what she wrote next, out of curiosity, but I would never tell someone \\"Oh - you must read \\"Casual Vacancy\\", it's so good!\\" It's not that good. I am glad to be done with it, when I read a book I truly love - I don't want it to end.
B001K3EXTA|5.0|this film places the viewer in the  midst of 20's gold coast long island. visually stimulating. very close to the novel.
B00979CS50|5.0|As a long time Neil Young (and Crazy Horse) fan, I have come to expect, even on his best albums, a mixed bag - for what makes him great (his willingness to cast absolutely everything aside for the sake of inspiration) is also what makes him frustrating (see Greendale, his last record with Crazy Horse...an album with considerable potential that came out sounding like a first draft in bad need of an edit).  With his newest, Psychedelic Pill, however, the inspiration comes across undaunted with very little of this aforementioned downside.  This is a passionate, positive album from a band that still sounds inspired and even hungry into their late 60s, and shows us, as Leonard Cohen did earlier this year, that getting old is entirely optional.<br /><br />Psychedelic Pill opens with \\"Driftin' Back\\", a long trance-jam meditation that never sounds flat or boring, and even feels somehow too short at 27 minutes.  The lyrics - which decry the sorry state of MP3s and consider the merits of a \\"Hip hop haircut,\\" whatever the hell that is - seem improvised throughout, but they are not the point here...the here-to-eternity instrumentals are, and they more than make up for any forced rhymes.  The title track, a short, celebratory stomper that's simple but not slight, follows, with frenetic speaker-to-speaker transitions that give it a fuzzy, hallucinogenic quality.  The third song, \\"Ramada Inn\\" is one of Neil's all-time greats, a simple paean to love over time with a few amazing (and deeply moving - almost devastating) chord changes.  The extended solos here are, again, never, ever boring, and sound as fresh, loud, and inspired as anything Neil has played in ages.  The first disk ends with \\"Born in Ontario\\" a joyous country-rock chugger that tells Neil's story much more succinctly - and perhaps effectively - than he did over 490 pages of his recent autobiography.<br /><br />Disc two is no let-up.  \\"Twisted Road\\" picks up, both lyrically and musically, where \\"Born in Ontario\\" leavesoff, celebrating the past without lamenting its passing, and then \\"She's Always Dancing\\", replete with more impassioned soloing, provides an answer to the bitter-sweetness of \\"Ramada Inn\\" by extolling the virtues of being in the moment, \\"Out on the edge,\\" where there are \\"No ties to bind [us] down.\\"  Next, \\"For the Love of Man\\" provides a simple, soft respite, but is by no means a throwaway, its lovely piano and ambling pace giving it the qualities of an old-time spiritual.<br /><br />The album ends with the excellent \\"Walk Like a Giant,\\" a song as epic lyrically as it is musically, and that's saying something.  (I first heard it on his recent tour, and told my wife and friend, five minutes in, \\"This is a damn great song.\\"  They both said they were about to say the same thing.)  There is lament here - \\"We were ready to save the world/ But the weather changed/ And the white got stained/ And it fell apart/ And it breaks my heart/ To think about how close we came/ I want to walk like a giant on the land\\" - but there is also, if only in the sheer, unceasing joyousness of the musical delivery, hope, as though Neil is saying that we didn't quite make it even while showing us that we still can.  \\"Walk Like a Giant\\" is a contender for my favorite Neil track of all time, and that is also really saying something.<br /><br />I've always maintained, when looking at Neil's recent work, one must judge him in relation to his 60s peers - in which case he almost always comes off better.  Psychedelic Pill, however, stands on its own merits as one of the best releases of 2012, no matter who you compare it to.  This album rocks in a way that is both thrilling and moving, and there are no let-downs, no moments where one might say, \\"If only he had done this...\\"<br /><br />And while there is no new ground broken here - Neil and the Horse employ the same simple, loud, repetitive structure that they always have - their old, hallowed ground is revisited with such gusto, such enthusiasm, thatthis makes no difference, and everything sounds new, fresh, and...well, groundbreaking.<br /><br />Psychedelic Pill is the work of a band not so much reclaiming what they always have been, but celebrating it.  And I am happy to be a part of that celebration.
B0058PJ6NE|2.0|omg that was like gigidi gigidi go haaa u probably like youtube so don't get if you r smart I'm mean Wat's the point???:0&trade;=)
B0073O8BOS|5.0|Awesome band. Saw live, great music to drive to and to share with friends or at a party. Put on your headphones and kick back with this group.
B008PNBU30|5.0|I loved it, best Three Days GRace album to date! i recommend it to anoone who listens to Alt Rock music.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|This game is done up very well in my opinion. Control is excellent for me and graphics are good. I was waiting awhile for this to finally reach my kindle fire. If you like final fantasy your going to enjoy this, Ignore the stupid reviews. I cant wait till the day amazon actually  monitors them.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Ken Follett has emerged as one of the not-to-miss-authors of<br />the grand saga genre of historical novels. This Book One of the<br />Century Trilogy conveys a vivid picture of early twentieth<br />century life in the coal mines of Wales, in pre-revolutionary<br />Russia,and in Europe and the USA, and traces the lives of a cast<br />of fascinating characters as they weather the harsh conditions of<br />life through the Great War 1914-1918. It whets the appetite for the<br />next novel in the trilogy. A great read, both entertaining and<br />educational.
0316228532|2.0|I know J. K. Rowling will write other books.  Her talent is exceptional!  This was just not my \\"cup pf tea\\".  Unfortunately, this hit close to home as to how society and teens react today.  I won't read a sequel.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|This book was really good! It is like the Hunger Games but is more romantic and mostly for girls. I would say this book is appropriate for ages 11 through 14. Matched is just as good as Crossed. You should read Matched first of course. It is lead into the beginning of Crossed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The storyline and characters were captivating. Once I started reading I couldn't put the book down. Its a very compelling story that keeps your interest. I'm looking forward to reading the second book.
B0050N65LU|5.0|I love all seasons of Bones, but Season 6 is really great because it is when Bones and Booth actually get together which if you are a fan, you have been waiting for!!  In the episode \\"Hole in the Heart\\" Booth and Bones are brought together in a time of grief. If you have never watched Bones, I recommended starting from the beginning so you can get to know the characters and how everyone fits into the puzzle. The cast is fabulous and the stories are fabulous.  ENJOY!!!!
B008GXHOFW|1.0|I need help whenever I open this game it goes straight back to the menu. do you know what is wrong?
B00316DDWW|5.0|I listened to this album on a chance recommendation from a fellow drum student on Facebook and was hooked immediately. That was two years ago. I still love it today. It never gets old.<br /><br />Being a fan of early / mid life Rush, King Crimson, Marillion, other progressive rock bands, and missing true statements in rock music, this is a breath of fresh air. Judd's drumming is fantastic, not just playing along but leading the band through tunes. I love how they morph between swing beats and heavy rock in Change, play crazy latin funk in Caudal Lure (had to look that one up, it's the way snakes attract and attack), and so much more.<br /><br />Ian Kenny's voice and lyrics are powerful and extremely well put together.<br /><br />Everything about this album is perfect. I can't wait for the next release.<br /><br />And if you want a heavy trip, Themata is an awesome complement.
B009DP9D6A|5.0|Love the album. For anyone that is a Deadmau5 fan or anyone just starting out, you'll love this album!! I would recommend the album to anyone that has a taste in music.
030758836X|3.0|Most novels lean more towards character development OR plot, but Flynn is a master of both.  She takes the foibles of the male stereotype to the nth degree.  The sophisticated humor is spot on.  The plot twists and the suspense are also superb.  Up to the point of the exodus from the cabin, I was enthralled with the author's expertise.  From there (perhaps harkening back to the latter part of that other novel set in the Hannibal area--HUCKLEBERRY FINN--that also loses momentum at the end) I was disappointed.  The machinations of plot took on the unbelievablility of the absurd.  The reader suffers through the development of Nick as a character, and then the novel ends abruptly, as if Flynn got tired of weaving plot sequences and took an easy out.  A comic character (is that Nick?) usually is fraught with woes until the denouement where he is in some way redeemed.  This conclusion has no redeeming quality, no justice served, no satisfying finality.  Amy is a dark character who never evolves, never is outed.  Where IS a denouement?!
B008I43DYU|5.0|I would recommend this app its worth .99&cent; I use it for my bills my job everything its great it has &pi; +=&divide;&times;
B008F5YDRI|4.0|This was an enjoyable \\"feel good\\" movie. Ian McGregor was good as usual..... good movie to kick back and enjoy a glass of wine with. I had not heard of it before a friend suggested it. A well kept secret.
0689815816|4.0|When I was in Kindergarten we learned this chant, not from a book bit from a teacher, and it was lion not bear, but otherwise was a beloved story that I loved to participate in. We would sit in a circle and slap our knees to the beat. We must have done it once a week, all together, because thirty years later I still know it. So happy to find this book and to pass it along.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|We love to play the lower levels with the grandchildren. The harder levels are great to play in the evenings while the TV is in use.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Whether you like castle in the sky, spirited away, or even howl's moving castle more, you still cant argue that this is most likely miyazaki's most beautiful film that he has ever made, the story is unlike any other animated movie ever invented, it's about a warrior who one day get's a herendus mark on his arm from an orc god that has become a demon, and he end's up leaving his village to find the great forest spirit to lift the curse, while a growing war between the human's and the forest rage's on, with the forest being led by san of the wolf tribe, who's a human that was raised by wolf's, as the war goes on, people get greedy, violent, and in control till the point where the forest spirit end's up destroying most of the inhabitin's, the whole story is filled with lot's of quiet moment's and intense scene's that can even be pretty disturbing for young viewer's, the music is some of the most emotional heart-acking pieces of REAL MUSIC since titanic and platoon, and the dvd is also very greatfull for putting the trailer in there as a specile feature, you will not regret picking up this movie, it's one of the greatist movies ever made, period!!!!!!!!!!!
B005FLX2IQ|3.0|The quality of the audio is good and also the performance of Peter verygood exhibition.<br />The cd is arrived quickly to destination
B009KHBDUU|3.0|I generally like Tim Burton films and this movie is no exception. It's a movie I would watch again. I used to watch Dark Shadows when I was younger and wished they had been truer to the original. In any event I still highly recommend everyone to watch this version.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It can be a pretty tough game at times or it could be super easy but it's still really addictive! Great game and works well on my Fire!
B007THA4FI|4.0|This is a very well written book with fascinating characters and a very interesting storyline that pulls you in right up until the tragic end. This is book is not for you if 1)you need happy endings 2)you need any sort of happiness in a book 3)you're expecting Harry Potter or any sort of fantasy. This is a sad look into the lives people leave, the secrets that they keep and how they can be destructive.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a super fun game and great as a time-killer. It can get pretty tough and for some reason, I almost always end up dying on the rocky area though I'm not tilting my Fire. Still, it's a fun game that will keep you coming back when you've got spare time (or want to procrastinate) .

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It kind of bugs me a little that people are complaining about you having to pay for coins. It's a coin dozer game. It only makes sense that you only have coins that you earn... otherwise there would be no point in the game and it'd just be mind-numbing. It is free. In fact, the coins regenerate after awhile so the game STAYS free. Yes, it takes awhile but with the right bonuses the regeneration time shortens and the regeneration limit increases. It's a simple, fun coin dozer game. It is what it is and it's good.

B009RI4FRU|1.0|this piece of crap is terrible the actors and writers should send out refunds to the poor saps that rented it
0374533571|5.0|I love this book! I have actually laughed out loud at times and cried at others. Pat is such an endearing and earnest character. I don't want to finish it because I don't think the next book I read I could enjoy as much as I've enjoyed this one! I want to continue on Pat's journey and spend more time with him and Tiffany and Dr. Patel. I think I know how it will end, which isn't to say it's predictable; I think it will end just as it should (Pat will get his happy ending, it just won't be the one he thought. Which is just how silver linings and life works, right?). The problem is, I just don't want it to end! Matthew Quick makes you care so much about his characters that you will just want to curl up with this book and spend more time with them. And by the end of the book, I predict he will leave me wanting more.<br /><br />I didn't actually buy this book on Amazon. I bought it at Target for 20% off the cover price, but it is cheaper here, so I recommend buying it here. So Buy it! You will not be disappointed!<br /><br />UPDATE: After finishing this novel, I can tell you there were a few surprises, but it did end as I thought (and had hoped), but even so, I was still crying by the final page. A satisfying and enjoyable read for sure!!

B009NQKPUW|4.0|Short summary: stunning visuals, weak story, weaker science. Still, as this movie was shot in 3D, I am happy to own the Blu-Ray if only as a beautiful demo of 3D. The Amazon instant video gives up much of the visual impact beyond the loss of 3D. The picture quality of the streaming version is not even close to the Blu-Ray. This is a blow to the one true strength of this movie.

B007THA4FI|4.0|I spent the first hundred or so pages waiting to run across a character I could care about.  I kept thinking, \\"What is she DOING?  Where is this GOING?\\"<br /><br />Slowly, though, I found myself being pulled into the story.  Rowling is brilliant at plotting a story.  This whole story revolves around the \\"butterfly effect,\\" where one small event causes another, and then another, and seemingly unrelated people and events forever change the lives of others.<br /><br />I did feel that Rowling was a bit self-consciously going for the \\"adult\\" at times, where subtlety and understatement would have been more effective than the explicit and gross.<br /><br />It's tough not to compare this book, as different as its subject and audience is, with the HP series.  When you are reading one of the Harry Potter books, you are transported to a different world--the writing is almost transparent, the medium (like floo powder) that simply takes you where you are supposed to go.  In this book, you are constantly aware of the author's voice, and the writing is often clunky and jarring (sometimes intentionally, I suspect).<br /><br />So, no, I didn't love it.  But there was still a lot to admire about the novel, which ultimately DID make me care about the characters (many of them, anyway).  And, in the end, I liked it.  I hope that in her next book for adults Rowling relaxes a little and lets the story unfold without so much embellishment that distracts from the story.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King, the master of the macabre, did it again. Taking a page from history, he spins a tale of time traveling to save the life of President John F. Kennedy. A masterfully told tome, as only King can do. What a concept; to travel back in time to change the course of history. The hero of this story meets many unexpected trials and tribulation on his evenful journey. King brings the early 60's to life, recalling much of the culture of the time, in a masterful way. I was there and I remember; a much simpler time. The sorrow and shock of loosing a beloved President. A time of turmoil and stress as the Cold War heated up. The reader will be very surprised at the twist ending. Don't read the last chapter until you have read Chapter 30. \\"Dancing is life.\\"

B005LAII7G|4.0|In the future, The judges enforce the laws in Megacity One, a densely populated city brewing with crime and chaos. Dredd [Karl Urban] is ordered to work with a new Judge [Olivia Thirby] to see if she has what it takes to do the job. What seems like a routine call to investigate a double murder at the Peach Trees housing projects suddenly turns into a fight for survival for Dredd and his partner for the day when the drug lord who owns the building Ma-Ma [Lena Headey, in a very memorable and seductive performance] closes off the building locking the two Judges inside with nowhere to go and being marked for death. Now this is the Dredd movie we should have gotten the first time around! Relentless in its tone and very violent, This movie harkens back to the good old days when action movies were about one thing only: good action. The 3D in the movie is very good too as the slow-mo induced scenes are captivating in 3D. Karl Urban and Lena Headey [especially Lena Headey] are so great in this movie that it's a joy to watch the movie whenever either one of them are on screen. I admit that i didn't know what to expect when i went to the movies to see this [being that i was very dissappointed with the 1995 movie] but i am glad that i gave this movie a chance because this is the best pure no-frills action movie i've seen in a long time. This movie feels like a genuine attempt at a Dredd movie and i think that Judge Dredd fans who love the comics will be pleased with this movie. Unfortunately, like the 1995 movie that came before it, This movie has failed at the box office [earning even less than the 1995 movie did] and it's a shame that it did fail because i would've loved to have seen a sequel to this movie with Karl Urban reprising his role as Judge Dredd. Here's to hoping that this movie does better on DVD and Blu-Ray because this could really be the start of something great
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This author is dangerous. He changes the reality of our lives. Fear him and his damnable talent.

1558908846|2.0|In Megacity One far in the future, Crime is out of control and it's up to the judges to control the streets [which are essentially police officers with the added power of also being able to find people guilty and sentenced on the spot in addition to arresting or even killing them if neccessary]. The most fearsome judge, Judge Dredd [Sylvester Stallone] fights crime on the streets until he himself is framed for a murder he didn't commit. Now, on the run with the help of a petty criminal he judged [Rob Schneider, who is out of place here], Dredd must clear his name and find the person responsible for the crime. The first 15 minutes are very well done and Dredd is introduced in a highly memorable fashion. However, Dredd unfortunately removes his helmet [along with the rest of his trademark outfit for much of the movie] and after this, the movie no longer feels like Judge Dredd but instead feels like any other Sylvester Stallone movie. This movie could have and should have been much better since Stallone seems perfect for the role of Judge Dredd. The action is ok [and never lets up] and the special effects are decent for the time this movie was made. The acting, while pretty poor at times, is salvaged somewhat by Armand Assante as Rico Dredd the movie's main villain and by the lovely Diane Lane [she makes good eye candy in this movie making the movie a little easier to digest]. In a way, this movie probably should have had a different storyline as this just seemed too inevitable that this movie was gonna be a generic on-the-run movie. I should also say that before the release of this movie, i like many others in north america, have never heard of Judge Dredd so basically this movie made me aware of the character. If you are a Dredd fan who loves the comics then stay far away from this movie as this movie will make you mad. A couple of months ago, a second unrelated Judge Dredd movie was released, simply titled Dredd.

B008JMKN4Y|3.0|Beautiful Disaster has an interesting premise, but the writing lacks maturity.  Too much emphasis has been given to assigning nicknames to the characters, rather than giving said characters depth and definition.  I struggled to get through the first chapter or two, simply because the writing itself was not very accomplished.  However, despite the lack of quality writing skills, I eventually grew to care about the characters and found myself wanting to know what happens with them.<br /><br />While this author is not going to win any awards for the writing skills used in penning this book, the characters are interesting enough to keep the reader interested.  If you're looking for an easy read, Beautiful Disaster will keep you entertained, but probably won't make you want to read it again.
1780540655|5.0|This Calendar really tells the story of MJ. Beautifully depicted! I checked for the perfect MJ calendar, and \\"This Is It!\\"
B0070Y46UY|5.0|As a mother who screens everything her 13-year-old daughter reads - or still valiantly tries to - I was SO GLAD that her curiosity was piqued enough by the movie trailer to ask to read the actual book. Through the years, we'd gone through a number of survival stories: \\"Hatchet\\", \\"A Week in the Woods\\" - and among them, more intriguing and less likely, the abandoned-on-a-desert-island tale: \\"The Cay\\", \\"The Island of the Blue Dolphins\\", \\"Swiss Family Robinson\\" ... of course, \\"Robinson Crusoe.\\" Apart from the very important growing up themes of self-preservation, adaptation and loneliness, the giving over of one`s destiny to a higher order forms an important understory in all of them. \\"Life of Pi\\" drives up the steak - oops, I meant \\"stake\\" somewhat. As said daughter is currently (already) quite taken by the philosophical themes presented in \\"The Life of Pi\\", I can honestly say this book was timely - and for all time. This book will not work for those looking for non-stop action: there are parts which drag along, exactly as life would, of course, if the situation were real. Rather, the book thrives on tension - both surface and spiritual. This is a book that will generate much thought and discussion through the years. Although it may seem rather incongruous right now, I chose for us to read Louis L'mour's \\"The Walking Drum\\" (previously reviewed) at the same time, in this case for the philosophical as well as middle-school history aspects. I would also suggest Edgar Allan Peo's \\"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket\\" for comparison. Said daughter's review (and minor mis-readings related to who ate what) follows:<br /><br />\\"'Life of Pi' by Yann Martel is an amazing, wonderful book that does, indeed, as the author says, make me believe in some sort of Holy Being.<br /><br />\\"When sixteen-year-old Piscine Molitor Patel, known to all as Pi (or 3.14), and his family and their animals from the zoo move from India to Canada, they go on a ship called the *Tsimtsum*. What they don't know is that that trip will change their lives forever.<br /><br />\\"The boat sinks and Pi is the only survivor. Well, the only *human* survivor - one of the animals from the zoo also survived: Richard Parker, one of the Bengal tigers.<br /><br />\\"This story is just *amazing*. To be honest, I never heard of the story until I decided to watch 'Hotel Transylvania' with a friend of mine. One of the previews before the movie was the movie version of the book, and both me and my friend decided that we simply *must* watch it as soon as it came out. I later found out that it was also a book, and got it at the library.<br /><br />\\"The story is both simple and complex - a boy's whole entire family dies, he is the only survivor except for a tiger, and he and the tiger survive for 227 days. No one believes his story, even though he has evidence of scratches and bones because it's too impossible. As one character says, 'In the experience of this investigator, his story is unparalleled in the history of shipwrecks. Very few castaways can claim to have survived so long at sea as Mr. Patel, and none in the company of an adult Bengal tiger.'<br /><br />\\"Yet, the story is hopeful and just awe-inspiring - Pi and Richard Parker are never friends, in the whole entire book. Yet, they both care for each other, and Pi always remembers Richard Parker. Pi loses his father, mother and brother, he watches Richard Parker eat a hyena, zebra and orangutan alive. He is forced to become a meat-eater, despite the fact that he has been a vegetarian his whole entire life. He goes blind for a few days, during which he meets a fellow castaway who is also blind with a French accent, but Richard Parker eats him. His sight returns, and he and Richard Parker are swept up to a botanically-impossible island. They finally arrive in Mexico, where Richard Parker decides to stay. Pi himself is rescued, 227 days after the ship sank.<br /><br />\\"Tell me, does that not make you believe in some DivinePerson or Persons?\\"
B003NFM3JU|4.0|To fully enjoy a movie the picture and sound are critical. This is especially true for Disney's, A Christmas Carol. I first saw this on IMAX in 3D and was very impressed. I later watched it on Netflix and enjoyed it, but the experience was not quite the same. While the story, animation, and voice acting were very good, much of the emotional impact of the story was lost at home without the engrossing effects of a six story three dimensional image and 10,000 watts of sound.<br /><br />However, I recently purchased a 3D TV and decided to pick up this 3D blu-ray. After watching it with the surround cranked and the glasses on I found the experience to be close to that of the theater. One drawback was that the aspect ratio was set at 2.40:1, which is the standard for widescreen cinema. As a result, the \\"black bars\\" were present at the top and bottom of my tv. Normally I wouldn't mind this, but the IMAX screen ratio is 1.43:1, and so to fit the full IMAX image into a 16:9 tv the black bars should have been present on the sides of the screen. As a result, there were times where I felt that I wasn't seeing everything that I should have been, similar to watching a widescreen film that has been cropped to fit a 4:3 TV. I'm not sure what the film's optimum aspect ratio was intended to be, but I'm inclined to think that 2.40:1 is not it.<br /><br />There are some original interpretations of the story and dialogue, and after reading some of A Christmas Carol, it seems to stay pretty true to the book. The chase scenes did get a little tiresome. I found myself wondering how much more screaming I could listen to, or how Jim Carrey managed to carry on like that in the studio. I think George C. Scott was a better Scrooge and other renditions took on a creepier interpretation that I thought worked better for the story, but this is a Disney film created in part for children, making it all the more appropriate.<br /><br />Overall I'm very happy with this purchase, especially on blu-ray 3D. The story is timeless, the voice acting is very good, the music is phenomenal, and the 3D effects are awesome. I think that the 3D is critical to fully enjoy this movie, as it doesn't quite hold up on the animation, voice-acting, and action alone. If the image filled the TV or was set at an IMAX ratio I would be inclined to give this 5/5.

1469984202|5.0|\\"WOOL: The Omnibus Edition\\" (Parts 1 through 5) by Hugh Howey<br /><br />4 ½ out of 5<br /><br />*Be aware of possible spoilers*<br /><br />There is no shortage of post-apocalyptic dramas and adventures.  Nor is there a shortage in post-apocalyptic dramas involving life in a bunker or some other vast underground structure.  Hugh Howey's offering is to me a unique venture into this realm.<br /><br />WOOL 1 starts out with the highest authority of law in the silo, the sheriff, committing the highest offense in this world: wanting out.<br /><br />Part 1 is very depressing.  It tells the story of Holston and his dead wife Allison, the last to be sent out for cleaning.  Cleaning was the corporal punishment.  It meant death.  The outer world was desolate and toxic to life.  We have no idea why, only that for generations and generations it has been this way.<br /><br />Believed to be the last remaining humans on the planet are the few thousands that live below the ground in this vast structure.  The only view that these individuals living below ground have of the world is the video display in the upper cafeteria of the barren hill and dilapidated city outside of their world.<br /><br />This is what they go to clean.  As time goes on, the sensor arrays become foggy and opaque with the grime thrown around in the outside world.  People start to become weary as the view becomes grimy and soon a cleaner, a criminal, will need to be chosen.  Holston is the criminal in this case as Allison was years before.  But why?<br /><br />That is what part 1 explores.  Why would two intelligent, seemingly well-put-together individuals want to go out to clean and subsequently die?<br /><br />The story flashes to years earlier where the two began to uncover oddities in the fabric of reality they have always known.  Signs begin to point to a world that is not as bleak as everyone is apparently made to believe.  Eventually these discoveries drive Allison to the point of wanting out, to risk her life for an idea.  It was a decision that broke her husband causing him the same desire.<br /><br />WOOL is wholly depressing and simultaneously alluring.  The characters are all well-written which only tends to make the story even more bleak, more hopeless.  How do these people continue to survive in a landscape that would drive many of the steadiest of people to go mad?  Their survival is captivating.<br /><br />I wasn't immediately drawn wholly in, which is my criticism.  I wasn't overly surprised in part 1 either.  Maybe it was just me.  I pushed through the beginning as Hugh did make the story interesting enough to hold my curiosity and read forward despite the depressed nature of the dialogue.  Part 1's ending also didn't surprise me in the way I would have wanted.  It's me being picky.  I saw enough clues in the reading of part 1 to easily see what was going on.  Hugh may not have been trying to surprise anyone, rather point out the façade making my critique possibly an unfair one, but it is how I felt.<br /><br />The true page-turning of the story didn't start to happen for me until near midway in WOOL 2.  A new Sheriff is needed.  Enter: Juliette, the mayor and deputy sheriff's top pick to replace the deceased Holston.  Juliette is a greaser, the lowest on the social structure within the silo.  She's a mechanic in the lower levels.  It is Juliette that really gets things going as her nomination is not a welcomed choice by the increasingly suspicious IT group, and you soon find out that there is far more about the world that people are purposefully not letting out.<br /><br />WOOL 3 through 5 continue this journey with an explosive opening for 3.  Where WOOL 1 and 2 were interesting, but slow, WOOL 3, 4, and 5 were much quicker, more compelling and caused my wife a lot of headache as I found it very difficult to put the book down.  I am now fully vested in this saga with<br /><br />I would certainly recommend picking this one up.  And I definitely look forward to the next chapters.  Hugh Howey did well overall on this.<br /><br />The breakdown ratings (out of 5) per episode in the omnibus:<br /><br />WOOL 1: 3 ½<br />WOOL 2: 4<br />WOOL 3: 5<br />WOOL 4: 5<br />WOOL 5: 5

B0034DGPEU|4.0|I read this for book club and at first was a bit confused on the characters and will say it's one of many books that could use a character list.  It's another reminder of the cruelty of slavery and yet there is a lot of love from Mama Mae, Papa and Uncle George (all slaves) to keep us going.  I was unaware of the Irish indentured until now.  There are still many questions I have that the author may have intended like what's the story behind Rankin, the land manager who seems to be the main antagonist to me.<br /><br />Some of the story seemed predictable but there are enough surprises and side stories to have kept it a page turner once I got to a certain point.  Besides what happened to the heir apparent, there is a lot of the usual and unwanted sexual happenings rendering biracial families.<br /><br />Our dear Lavinia, the Irish orphan who finds herself thrust into this interesting group knows nothing of America much less slavery has to find a way to realize and understand who are her allies and foes and she's smart enough.  This is her story.

B0020TS5LU|3.0|A wealthy English industrialist invites a score of friends and relatives to a shoot at his country estate, during the course of which he manages to threaten and infuriate a number of them, by withdrawing support for their business plans, canceling the allowances of relatives and abusing nearly everyone, That night, he's murdered, and the following day a quirky detective shows up in order to sort things out, gather everyone into the same room, and identify the guilty party. The traditional English drawing-room murder mystery.<br /><br />Except when it's done by Robert Altman. Altman brings all his skills and quirks to what would otherwise be yet another overly affected episode of Masterpiece Theater, making it into something very different. You've got the gorgeous Altman photography, for one thing, with long, involved scene that move through house, turn corners, and have dozens of characters entering and exiting. The effect is one of being inside of a stage play, and when it works, it works very well. But you also have Altman's more annoying filmic tics to deal with. The mood of the movie moves from solemn to slapstick and back again, and you're never quite sure what you should be feeling. Everyone is quite tense following the murder, and who should show up to investigate, but a comically bumbling detective inspector played by Stephen Fry, accompanied by a suffering- but deadly serious- sergeant. In the end, we, the viewers, know who did it, and why, courtesy of a confession freely given to a total stranger, but the guests and the police never do find out what happened, at least by the end of the movie, so far as are allowed to see.<br /><br />What saves this film and makes it worth watching is the collection of outstanding performances by leading English actors in a wide range of roles. There's Maggie Smith as the vituperative old aunt, a role she really owns in modern cinema. Michael Gambon doing the old industrialist. Helen Mirren as Head of House. Alan Bates as Jennings, the tortured, alcoholic butler with a secret that eats at him. Jeremy Northam doing a fabulous job singing his way through his role as Ivor Novello. Frank Thornton, late of &#34;Are You Being Served?&#34; as Mr. Burkett. The list goes on and on, with one superb performance after another, the sole exception being Bob Balalban delivering yet another wooden, stereotypical performance.<br /><br />So why three stars? Well, as entertaining as it is at times, it just doesn't really hang together. At the end the viewer has the feeling that they've been flipping back and forth between two different versions of the same movie, one a drama and the other a farce. Fun, yes, but also somewhat unsatisfying.ennings, the tortured, alcoholic butler with a secret that eats at him. Jeremy Northam doing a fabulous job singing his way through his role as Ivor Novello.

1608201236|5.0|Fifth and last in the Adrien English gay mystery series revolving around Adrien, a writer of mysteries and the owner of a bookstore, Cloak and Dagger Books, specializing in mysteries in Southern California.<br /><br />My Take<br />This is the last installment in this series. And I am miserable! Even if Lanyon does provide an online Christmas interview with the two of them on his website. I just adore Adrien and Jake and I will miss their adventures...hint, Lanyon, hint, hint...<br /><br />Lanyon brings in the three major loves of Adrien's life---Guy, Mel, and Jake---and provides an opportunity for each to battle for Adrien's affections, to say good-bye. Lanyon is rather clever in how he presents everyone's arguments, forcing Adrien to consider the qualities he's looking for in a partner. Forcing him to realize who has those qualities in spite of everyone!<br /><br />I am going to miss Adrien's snark! I particularly enjoyed his responses to Dr. Shearing's comments!<br /><br />\\"The scar looked perfectly normal---if you were a cadaver or related to Frankenstein's monster.<br /><br />\\"Anyone who finds white support hose sexy needs to check in with...<br /><br />\\"It's hard to go wrong with grilled cheese...but somehow they managed.<br /><br />\\"And they're off! I kept a polite expression on my face while her mouth galloped along yards ahead of her brain.\\"<br /><br />Tip to anyone having remodeling done: Don't trust the construction locks the contractor installs. They all use the same key!<br /><br />There's a sweet, erotic paragraph which plays right into the music sub-theme in Dark Tide. You'd think it would be hokey, but Lanyon plays it just right.<br /><br />The Story<br />Adrien insisted on coming home early instead of staying on at his mom's place after his open heart surgery. He's pushing everyone away, wanting his privacy, and the chance to think. Only, the bad guys are just not cooperating. Someone keeps trying to break into his bookstore and being put on hold by 9-1-1 just isn't working for Adrien.<br /><br />Worse, he's not allowed to work for six weeks and Natalie is swamped at the bookstore. Nor do any of the temp agencies want to send anyone...too many murders at Cloak and Dagger Books! Wait'll you get a load of Ms. Pepper...eek!<br /><br />When the skeleton is discovered under the floorboards of Adrien's new acquisition...well, it'll take more than a bad ticker to hold Adrien back from investigating.<br /><br />The Characters<br />Adrien English suffered from rheumatic fever as a teen and after events in [[ASIN:1937909263 Death of a Pirate King (Adrien English Mysteries #4)]], has had to undergo open heart surgery. Tomkins is his pushy cat. His overprotective mother, Lisa, married Councilman Bill Dauten, which brought three stepsisters into the family: Lauren is getting a divorce from her jerk of a husband; Natalie is the middle child and is working for Adrien at the bookstore; and, Emma is the youngest and horse mad. Especially for Adagio, a fourteen-and-a-half-hands-high Arabian. Warren is Natalie's boyfriend whom she uses to threaten the family.<br /><br />Former-LAPD Lieutenant Jake Riordan is hanging out his shingle as a private investigator. He's realized that he has compromised his honor as a cop because he was hiding his sexual preferences and has quit the force. He also came out to his wife Kate, a fellow cop, and his family (Danny is his youngest brother). He is considering a job offer as a sheriff in Vermont.<br /><br />Mel Davis is the boyfriend who dumped Adrien some years ago. He didn't want to get too emotionally invested in \\"a cardiac cripple\\". And Adrien's life expectancy is much better now. Ted and Jean Finch are still shopping their mystery book featuring an Adrien-like detective. Paul Chan was Jake's homicide partner; he's still attending the writing critique group at Cloak and Dagger Books. Ms. Pepper is awful enough to make Angus look good.<br /><br />Henry Harrison claims to be a tourist from Milwaukee interested in historic buildings. Fernando is the foreman of the construction crew rehabbing the space next door to Adrien's bookstore. Dr. Shearing is the therapist on Adrien's cardiac rehab team. A typical doctor. Doesn't listen to a thing you say and simply assumes you're like everyone else. Is it any wonder some of their patients slack off? I'd do it just to be pissy.<br /><br />LAPD Homicide Detective Alonzo is a first-class jerk. Jay Stevens was the clarinetist and leader of the band, the Moonglows, back in the mid-1950s. Seems he had a lucrative sideline as well. Now he's the skeleton under the floorboards. Nick Argyle was the detective interested in Stevens' life back in the 50s. Dan Hale owned The Tides bar in Malibu, was rumored to be connected to the mob, and had a thing for Jinx, Jay's sister. Professor Louise Reynard taught art history in the 50s. Guilliam Truffaut claimed to have been with the Resistance during the war. His daughter, Evelyn, didn't think much of him. Chris Powers is the son of a senator with his own political plans. Jane Powers is his mother.<br /><br />The Cover<br />The cover is the night with a sliver of a moon with, I'm guessing *, a naked Jake pushing through the waves.<br /><br />* It's a guess because the model just doesn't look like Jake, but then he doesn't have the scar from the surgery either, so he wouldn't, technically, be Adrien either...?<br /><br />The title is perfect. It's Jinx's diatribe about fear, gut-wrenching fear, Paul Kane's actions in Death of a Pirate King, the struggle Jake has had all his life, all the things that make people do what they do---The Dark Tide \\"dragging them like an undertow\\".waukee interested in historic buildings.

B003MC5N28|5.0|This is a definite book to get.  It has been my favorite book for the last year. It has a very interesting plot.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Somewhat fun but can be slow/boring.  I can be very time consuming.  You do not have to think playing this game.  I enjoy playing this game when stress or tired. This game brings back happy memories from my childhood.
1423140605|4.0|This book even for a guy my age was entertaining its a good morning stater everyday and a good read before sleep each night keeps your dreams interesting and well worth the little you pay for it. My appreciation goes out to Mr.Riordan, but I will say the only thing that I don't like is that space between books in the series leaves a lot to be desired
1476712042|2.0|I liked the book, sort of.  Abby (the \\"heroine\\") was WAY to moody and for all the people Travis was beating up over her, he should have just hit her instead.  One second she was sleeping with him, the next she was ignoring him.  And despite the description, Abby is no good girl.  She drank her self half to death through the whole book and dressed like a slut.  She wore a cardigan twice and the rest of the time she was in tight jeans and mini skirts.<br />I liked Travis, but I didn't like the codependency aspect.  In the first few pages he sees her and then all of a sudden he needs her by his side or he can't eat.  He won't go ANYWHERE without her. And she was codependent on him as well- she wanted him to agnst over her.  She liked that he chased her and wanted to give but if he said ONE wrong word she shut him down.  She broke up with him by simply leaving after she slept with him.  Everytime Travis tried to move on, she inserted herself back into his life.  If he was with another woman she would pout and storm off.<br />My biggest problem with the book is Abby's best friend America.  Anytime Abby got hurt, so much as someone bumping into her, she would rush to her defense.  She protected her like a mother bear.  It seemed she was just as codependent on Abby as Travis.  She broke up with her own boyfriend (Travis's cousin and roommate) if he stuck up for Travis in any way (and someone needed to stick up for the poor boy.)  In one scene after one of the many break ups of Abby and Travis, Abby went to his appartment and he came home with another woman.  America lashed out at Travis and started hitting him because he hurt Abby's feelings.<br />Everyone loved and gushed over Abby, despite the fact she was a complete bitch.  If anyone is in a relationship like Abby and Travis, or Abby and America, or Abby and Parker- they are in a very bad relationship.  It seems to me Abby was the one who needed reforming, not Travis.  Travis could have done MUCH better than the whinny little Abby.little Abby.

B002LINIFI|4.0|humorous as well as heart-warming. . .<br /><br />This is a US version of the time-honored romantic stereotype of the saintly fool, a retarded person with a heart of gold--put into the distinctively US setting of 20th-century history. Wherever he goes--and Forrest seems to be wherever history is made--Gump brings his innocence and goodness.<br /><br />Worth watching.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I honestly couldn't stop reading! There were so many unexpected twists and turns, and I really developed feelings for the main characters. They live in a horrible world, under hideous laws. A lot of people die gruesome deaths. You'll have to read the series and see how they deal with it... it really is an amazing trilogy. I highly recommend it!

My favorite author is back on track again with a great novel.  I felt Patricia Cornwell was getting back to what originally made me check eagerly to find out when the next one was coming out.<br /><br />If you have read this series in the past, and gave up on it, come back and read this one.

B0028N72A8|4.0|This otherwise remarkable short history of Google gets some points deducted for its hubris-laced introduction, which starts off with this opening line:<br /><br />\\"Not since Gutenberg invented the modern printing press more than 500 years ago, making books and scientific tomes affordable and widely available to the masses, has any new invention empowered individuals, and transformed access to information, as profoundly as Google.\\"<br /><br />I almost put the book down right there. I love and use Google almost daily, but seriously? The company was only seven years old at the time this book was published. The arrogance of this statement taints the origin story of one of the global economy's leading companies.<br /><br />If you can stomach or ignore the introduction, The Google Story is a fine read.
0316228532|2.0|I'm having the hardest time reading this book!  Oh, it's written well, but unlike Potter's world, a world in which we want to dwell in this is a world you are indifferent to at best and dislike at worst. We are use to compelling and interesting characters from J.K. alas there are none here!<br />If I had checked this book out from the library instead of buying it I would have returned it by know unfinished!
B006ISJQ1W|4.0|I bought this because of it's star, because when Johnny Depp makes a movie it's usually a slam dunk. I've never seen a Johnny Depp movie where his acting disappointed. He's made better movies but I'm glad I bought this movie. I really enjoyed this.

0345803485|1.0|I only read this book because it was a best-seller.  Now I'm ashamed of having read it because it is not only immoral but also illogical.  For example, how can a girl with a future -- a possibly bright future -- get involved with a man who treats her like dirt? Also, how can a student with a high GPA have a vocabulary limited to Geez, Double crap, etc.? And how dare an author repeat herself so much? Thank goodness I only bought the first book.  I really wish I could get my money back.  Then there is the time I spent reading this \\"literature\\" -- or should I say pornography?
B000E1MXSW|4.0|Very good and well acted. Gives a very good picture though it focuses a bit negatively maybe. Being a nun is really a calling.

B005I6EVUG|4.0|There are a great many things to like about this cover. It's lightweight, has a nice feel and a vibrant color, and even provides a certain degree of protection. Plus, it has the pocket at the side for notes. I do wish it had a clasp or elastic around the front or something so that you don't have to worry about the cover opening in your bag and exposing the Fire screen. And since I have a tendency to fold back the cover, I do worry about the spine, which feels like the least sturdy or well-built part. But only time will tell.
B000UJ48O0|5.0|I purchased this box set two years ago and it remains one of my favourite TV show box sets for sheet ingenuity of design.<br />Yes, my first 2 boxsets came shattered. The acrylic housing just couldn't take coming all the way from the states to England but Amazon were very good at replacing it for me. On the third delivery, the box was fine and I was extremely pleased!<br />The lenticular cover is lovely, thoughtful, understated, relevant to the show and telling of the feel of it.<br />The book is great, (my main gripe is that opening it has worn away the print of the fold between the cover and spine) and has an exclusive interview with Josh Schwartz, lots of photos of the cast and the episodes (perfect for a show like this) and episode descriptions. The disc print has been redone, numbering them all, but retaining the colour coding of the individual sets. I am pleased that the complete Atomic County episodes were included, as this was the main reason I bought this set. These short webisodes were a sort of spinoff from the main show, but fans will get a real kick out of it.<br />When so many boxsets today suffer from a lack of design and feel cheap, this OC set feels every ounce as opulant as the world it features.
0316228532|2.0|The only good thing about this book is the language. JK Rowling can write. She could write about raindrops and I would read.  However, I think the point of this book is that Rowling wanted to make sure people knew that she could write an adult book. She did. It's just not a good one. Flat, uninteresting characters, and a VERY predictable plot. I wanted to like this book. I knew it wasn't HP. I didn't want it to be HP. And I am very disappointed.
1439175640|2.0|The book has pages backward. The edges of the leaves are badly cut. I expected a better quality product. The product is new but has manufacturing faults. Likewise were correct at the time of shipping.

B002U6DVQM|3.0|I've had to admit this before, but I don't know much about the creator of 8 ½, Federico Fellini.  I've certainly heard of him for decades, but until recently, I had not seen any of his films.  I recently watched AMARCORD, and found it energetic and evocative, but kind of empty as well.  A man looking back on his childhood with clear memories of how he FELT, portraying events in the over-important manner that kids think about the things that happen to them...like nothing is more important.  I enjoyed the film, but didn't quite understand the fervor.<br /><br />8 ½ caused many similar feelings for me.  It's filmed in gorgeous black and white, and it's even more of a dreamlike experience than AMARCORD.  On the surface, it tells the story of a famous Italian film director, Guido (played by the really terrific Marcello Mastroianni), who has perhaps had some sort of minor breakdown or creative collapse, and has gone to a spa somewhere in Italy.  Presumably, he has gone to get away from it all for a while, but he is surrounded by producers, critics, actors, who are all ready for him to start his next film.  It's clear Guido has no clear idea of what his film is about, except it is clearly meant to be autobiographical...yet he isn't sure what he's saying with the film.  Guido doesn't exactly have writer's block...he's got TOO much inspiration.  Seemingly, he desires to cram his entire life into the film, making it an homage to the important women in his life, and perhaps an apology.  While Guido clearly knows a lot of men...it is the women who have been important to him and who he has treated poorly throughout his life.  He remembers his mother, the village prostitute (very different than the village prostitute in AMARCORD), his many girlfriends, his wife, his sister, his current mistress.  They are all different.  He clearly has affection for them, and they mostly have some for him as well...but are frustrated, angry even tormented by his poor treatment.  They have offered him love, and he has given much less in return.<br /><br />The story is intermixed with numerous odd fantasies that Guido has.  He imagines scenes such as living in a harem with all his women, who are happy to share his attention.  He remembers scenes from his life.  Each piece he conjures is like a little absurdist piece...ridiculous and revealing.  But Fellini has even filmed his \\"normal\\" scenes like some crazy dance sequence...camera swirling, voices coming from all directions, extreme close-ups.  So even Guido's \\"real life\\" feels dreamlike.  The spa is an odd place, apparently real, yet somehow fantastical in its operation.  The movie set being built for Guido is a huge launching pad for a spaceship...yet we get absolutely no idea how a travel into space has anything to do with the movie Guido is apparently creating.<br /><br />8 ½ explores (in my mind...I chose not to read any essays before throwing my thoughts out there) the crush of fame, as everyone around him is drowning Guido in their own demands.  It explores the psyche of a man who can't be faithful and/or can't return love.  It explores the creative process itself.  It's a film about a guy making a film about a guy who makes films.  Mastroianni is certainly a stand-in for Fellini himself...the film must surely by auto-biographical to some degree.  It feels too specific not to be.<br /><br />The cinematography is splendid.  The editing feels way ahead of its 1963 time.  The performances all nicely balance realism and an over-the-top cartoonishness...suitable for the circus-like atmosphere of the proceedings.  The music is appropriately loud and insistent.  We sense Guido is in a pressure cooker, and all these loud, sweaty people, loud, brassy music and swirling cameras are keeping him off balance and ready to explode.  Even in his calmest moments, and there are many, Guido is thinking, thinking, thinking.  How will he meet the demands of those around him...and why should he?<br /><br />The movie wasadmirable...yet for me it left me only bemused, not really entranced.  The character of Guido is simply too unlikeable.  He's charming as can be...but Guido (and thus, Fellini) is guilty of too much navel gazing and (as one character says near the end) assumes that people will find his life interesting.  Yes, Fellini is a beloved director and ground-breaking filmmaker...but exploring what a jerk he is and how tormented by his own fame is a bit of a bore.  I was unable to get through the film in one sitting...it took me three chunks of roughly 45 minutes to get to the end.  I feel dreadfully shallow saying this, especially about a film that is practically popping with energy and creativity.  But for me, the shallow philosophizing (really, just the director trying to excuse and ask forgiveness for piggish behavior) just doesn't make it compelling.<br /><br />I viewed the Criterion Blu-Ray.  The picture is splendidly crisp.  Dialogue, strangely, often seemed slightly out of synch with the actors.  Not sure if this isn't from the original.  But the subtitles are HORRIFIC.  I've complained about Criterion's subtitles before...they insist on white subtitles even on black & white films, with little or no outlining of the letters.  This has been a pain before, but 8 ½ has many scenes with significant swaths of white, and I found myself having to pause from time to time just to squint and read the subtitles.  Criterion does such a great job with so many other aspects of what they do...why for goodness' sake can't they do better with the all-important subtitles?<br /><br />8 ½ was worth seeing.  It's a classic and it's an important part of cinematic history...thus, I feel I've checked off a film on the list of \\"you can't be a true movie buff if you haven't seen these films.\\"  Yet it felt a little too much like homework for me to give it a ringing endorsement.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely love pinterest...I have learned so many new things to do and to wear and to cook...It is so 'nice to have a place where we can see such interesting things, and get others opinions of the different items on<br />this site...I am so glad I found this...Whoever is responsible , I thank you!!!

B003TJR2HS|5.0|Handy little item although very pricey. If you need an extension for your iPhone this is the best item. Should be less money!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very challenging in the later levels. fun brain teaser type game. good for spatial recognition, planning ahead, etc. also has a timed challenge if you want to see how fast you can go.
B009329ZF2|4.0|Not a bad movie, good action and special effects. The story was not bad. The way that the movie ended leaves open the possibility of a BATTLESHIP 2.
B00992CF6W|5.0|According to my 10 year old son, it's worth it just for the fact that you can save your work.  It's really great.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I loved this game! I can't wait until part 2 is released, great story, graphics, and challenging without being too difficult. I had to force myself to put it down to go to work or sleep. I highly recommend it!

B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Only commenting on the quality of the box set. Awesome deal for the price (Though I got it for $19.99 using a $10 Amazon past promotional credit), The Blu-ray in 2D picture was amazing, I can't comment on the 3D side since I do not have a 3D TV, though I plan on it later on during the holiday season, the special features are plentiful, haven't watched all of them, a bunch of deleted scenes, including the extended ending, which I prefer, since it shows more on (Spoiler Alert) the last battle. Overall, very happy with my purchase, and quality of the box set and bang for your buck on what it offers, even at the $29.99 price range.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|This app has probably the most beautiful UI that I've ever seen. It's a great way to view news and your any social networking sights you use. I'm never going to look at Facebook mobile on my kindle fire through the web browser again! :D
B008BSPQ3E|5.0|I love box sets of bands that I have enjoyed over the years.  For me, I am not a total Peter Gabriel Fan, but I really liked the albums So, Us, and OVO.  Us was probably my favorite, but I never would have listened to it if it was not for So.  Many box sets are disappointing because they release the old CD and usually not much more.  Some other reviews have suggested more songs that have never been released and that would have been nice, but I am sure there are legal reasons or something like that.  Anyhow, the first thing I like about the live music is that there is both a DVD AND and CD version.  I really get frustrated when bands want you to purchase both separate.  Overall I have really enjoyed the set.  The box itself is medium quality.  The book is a little on the light side of material.  I was hoping for more pages.  It is not as bad as some of the disappointing U2 books and does provide some good insight into the music.  Overall I give the set 5 stars for what it is.  As far as any major complaints, I only have one.  The set comes with vinyl versions of So (who listens to vinyl anymore).  But that is not the complaint.  The complaint is that the two bonus songs, Courage and Sagrada is only on the the vinyl.  What am I supposed to do, go out and purchase a record player?  Come on.  By the way, this comment is in no manner to dis anyone who is into vinyl.  It is just that the majority of folks do not listen to record players any longer.  After reading this review, you may wonder why I rate the box set 5 stars.  I think that overall for $100 bucks it is a decent set, well put together, and rewarding overall sound.  MAD
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I LOVE this game! You don't even have to really buy like 10 games at first you need to get the game where you brush the teeth it gives you 19,500 points for just one game. ITS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008ANFRG6|5.0|I have to say this, and many may disagree with me.  This is the best Vai music to date.  The positives - Steve Vai has always been way out there with his beliefs and jargon but this is the first CD in a while that really is true to his music.  Here is what I mean.  Some of his stuff and weird sounds, screaming, deamons, chains echoing, strange lyrics, and just overall a weird funk vibe.  Finally, he has come out with music that is just music.  There are no weird sound effects and hellish sounds in the background.<br /><br />The positives: Creamsicle Sunset, Mullach a' tsi, and Sunshine Electric Raindrops are phenomenal!  The best Vai ever!<br />John the Revelator, a redone song aboslutly ROCKS!  The song is a wall of sound and has to be followed up by Creamsicle Sunset just to let the brain relax after so much rushes at you.<br />Vloorum and Gravity Storm are very fun rock tunes.<br /><br />1. The Story of Light<br />2. Velorum<br />3. John the Revelator<br />4. Book of the Seven Seals<br />5. Creamsicle Sunset<br />6. Gravity Storm<br />7. Mullach a' tS&iacute;<br />8. The Moon and I<br />9. Weeping China Doll<br />10. Racing The World<br />11. No More Amsterdam<br />12. Sunshine Electric Raindrops<br /><br />Any disappointments - Who and the heck knows what the Story of light is supposed to be about and how all of Steve's weird thoughts form a story with the actual music.  After reading the story of light liner notes - I have to say that Steve has kept the weirdness about him!  However, I must admit that the bonus material is fun to listen too.  Steve seems like a down to earth kind of guy.  As far a musical disappointments, the reading at the end of the Story of Light (the first song) ruins the overall music and listening pleasure of the very first tune.  Not complaining but the first half of the song is so very cool, then turns strange/boring/unenjoyable with the reading.  This is just an opinion and may not be shared by all.<br /><br />The result overall, when you get down to the music, is that this CD is just plain awesome.  Warning, trying to listen to other music after listening to this CD is difficult because the overall sound quality is totally awesome as well.  Way to go Steve.  MAD<br /><br />UPDATE: After several months of listening, this album still rocks.t down to the music, is that this CD is just plain awesome.  Warning, trying to listen to other music after listening to this CD is difficult because the overall sound quality is totally awesome as well.  Way to go Steve.

0064471837|5.0|Sabriel was a great read, I keep it when I move to read again! It's a throwback for me because I remember reading this book in middle school, and loved it then as well. I had the book on tape, which sadly isn't as gripping as the novel itself. Maybe I'm biased, but I feel like reading the book would be better.
B008GVD6D8|4.0|The book got better as it went on. Can't wait for the next book. It was nice it was about love in the end.
0525952926|4.0|This book, in hardback, is quite heavy--I have a difficult time reading in bed or at the fitness center.  It is quite full of characters and, like all his other books, complicated.  Don't know if I will read the third installment.  I don't remember this being a problem in Follett's previous serial books.

076115678X|4.0|Every curly girl should own this handbook!<br /><br />As a professional hairstylist of over 30 years, I find it extremely helpful in educating my clients with curly hair.<br /><br />The only section that I dispute is the one with the homemade recipes for 'treatments'.<br />They do not work. Hair does not absorb oil, but it clings to the outside of the hair, a process know as 'adsorbtion'.<br />It does not moisturize the hair, so gals, leave the kitchen ingredients where they belong, Carmen Miranda wasn't right after all.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|it was so so so so fun the policeman and dog are almost real and its so cool how you have to go quick.
B004LWZWGK|3.0|I saw Dark Knight Rises at the movies (twice) and on a bootleg DVD. I had to watch it 3 times to fully understand what was happening. Overall, it was a disappointment, but it wasn't the worst Batman movie (Batman and Robin still has that dubious distinction). It wasn't even the worst comic book movie of the summer of 2012 (Amazing Spider-Man).<br /><br />At 2 hours and 45 minutes, the movie was way too long. I nearly fell asleep watching it. It could've been condensed to 2 hours. Batman's voice sounded hoarse, like he needed lozenges. Bane's voice sounded even more ridiculous-it was a cross between Darth Vader and a James Bond villain. Bane was also too small- he wasn't much taller than Catwoman.<br /><br />Alfred was annoying throughout the entire movie. We get it- he doesn't approve of Bruce being Batman. He said the same crap in the first Nolan movie. As for Bane, his plot to destroy Gotham was similar to Ra's Al Ghul's plot in the first movie. I wish they were more consistent with Bane's comic book character.<br /><br />SPOILER<br /><br />After Bane pummeled Batman during their first confrontation, he tossed him into the pit. Bane didn't kill Batman because Batman didn't fear death. He feared being left in the pit while Bane destroyed Gotham. The pit was set up in a way where a person who wanted to escape had hope of escaping, but ultimately couldn't. In the pit, Batman randomly met some old philosopher dude. Batman's back had been broken by Bane, but after the old man punched the vertebrae back in place, he magically healed (even for a comic book movie, this was ridiculous). Batman then did some push-ups and sit-ups and was suddenly strong enough to fight Bane.<br /><br />During the final confrontation on Wall Street, the cops and Bane's minions were fighting each other like gladiators. Batman was winning his second battle with Bane when Miranda plunged a knife into him (which for some inexplicable reason didn't kill him). She then revealed that she was Ra's AlGhul's daughter Talia and that Bane was her protector when she was a child. Catwoman, who had been a morally ambiguous character, helped Batman by shooting at Bane. Batman then used the Batjet to dispose of the bomb over an ocean. He then faked his death and donated Wayne Manor to some orphans. He was last seen in France. Alfred saw him and acknowledged, but didn't say anything to him. Batman deciding to retire and move to Europe is inconsistent with his character.<br /><br />I'm not the type of person who complains just for the sake of complaining. Many people complained about John Blake/Robin's character, but I found him to be interesting (though he definitely had too much screen time). This movie didn't live up to the hype, but it wasn't garbage. That's why I gave it a 3.
0425263908|2.0|I read the first of the 3 books and decided not to purchase the 2nd or 3rd.  If you've read the \\"Fifty Shades\\" series, these books are almost an exact duplication with only the names being changed.  Same type female, same type male--unusually young to be so wealthy, control of the female, etc etc.  I think the only missing part was the playroom which figured prominently in \\"Fifty Shades\\".  I enjoyed \\"Fifty Shades\\" but didn't want to read simply a duplication by a different author.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I was so excited that JK Rowling had a new book...until I began to read it. Too many story lines to try to keep straight.  Lots of local British dialect to decifer. Far too many needless f- bombs for my taste.  I am only 3/4ths through the book. I keep hoping if I keep reading it will get better but so far that is not the case. Harry,Ron, Hermione... where are you?
0143034901|5.0|Engrossing, captivating, spellbinding, masterful. There aren't enough superlatives to adequately describe just how good this book is. Reader, you won't be disappointed!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Good writing, but a far cry from book one and two. Seemed to drag on and I just wished for a little more romance from those two. Seemed so distant from how they were. Ending seemed rush and forced. Could have been so much better, but this book fell flat.
B005FISBTO|5.0|I love Dexter! Everyone's favorite serial killer is irresistible. I had to force myself not to watch the entire series in one sitting.
B003GX5CWY|4.0|Exciting testosterone driven movie.  Arnold'd pumped up lot's of macho and gunfire.  Good final showdown between Dutch (Arnold) and the Predator.
B005J32Y6Q|4.0|This film captures Flatley at the end of an extraordinary career - bringing Irish dance to millions.  It is little wonder that the reviews of the \\"flatty\\" version are not as good as the 3D.  I have watched both and the gap between the two is significant.  If you want to watch this film, beg, borrow, or go to a neighbor's to see it in 3D.  It is almost like watching a different film. The music is extraordinary. The feeling of being there in the audience is so greatly enhanced.  Flatley's onscreen time is diminished, but his dance ensemble is truly superior.  If I could have one wish, I would ask that the special effects were not so pronounced.  They distract from the dancing.  But, all in all, a wonderful experience.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I would rate this book a five, the best I have read in a long time! At first I was kinda thinking I don't want to read this because I am not into porn but the book isn't like that. Yes it does have sexy parts but not bad, kinda like a love story but with a good story. I read all three books in less than two weeks, then I was sad because I finished them and wondering what I am going to do to find another book this good.
B0090P98Z4|3.0|Game is super ugly and yet it's so laggy on Kindle Fire. Also it's freemium so at a certain level you're gonna wanna pay real life money to get better equipment and survive. fix game and 5 stars.

B0000026HG|4.0|Great requiem recording for the price.  The orchestra sounds a little lean but is still formidable.  The Kyrie (my personal favorite because I like the fugue style here) is taken at just the right tempo to make this movement shine.  The only point of contention I might have is that at the very end on the last chord I seem to hear a clarinet playing and holding a note that sounds like a major 3rd interval and then the player slides it down to a minor third to \\"correct\\" it, making the error even more noticeable.  Other than this, I love the entire recording.  I keep it in my car all the time.
B007T8BYWE|5.0|If you've tried any of GabySoft's FlipPix Art series, you probably understand why these puzzles are so popular. The apps contain picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid have to be colored or left blank according to numbers given at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture. Solving the FlipPix Art puzzles is a marvelously fun way to develop and practice logic skills. These kinds of puzzles are known as nonograms or griddlers, and they're extremely popular, with entire websites devoted to them. Each puzzle consists of an array of tiles, each of which is either filled or empty, Your goal is to determine which tiles are filled and which are empty.<br /><br />In this puzzle type, the numbers measure how many unbroken sets of filled-in tiles there are in any given row or column. For example, a clue of \\"2 4 1\\" would mean there are sets of two, four, and one filled tiles, in that order, with at least one blank tile between successive groups.<br /><br />If this isn't clear enough, don't worry, the FlipPix app includes an excellent tutorial to get you started. Puzzles come in three grid sizes:<br /><br />1. 5x5 grid. These are pretty easy, and they're great for beginners. There are up to three hints available, but you probably won't need them.<br /><br />2. 10x10 grid. These are much more challenging, and they're my favorite size. In a few of these, I had to use some of the hints.<br /><br />3. 15x15 grid. Brutal. I have yet to finish one of these without having to restart the puzzle a few times.<br /><br />For any grid size, you're only allowed two errors. On the third error, you have to restart the puzzle. In the Options menu, you can set the puzzles to ignore errors, but where's the challenge in that?<br /><br />FlipPix is one of those game concepts that would be clunky and awkward on paper, but plays beautifully on a computer or tablet. If you're not familiar with griddlers, give FlipPix a try, and I'm betting you'll be hooked on these puzzles.<br /><br />One tip for beginners: It's just as important to determine which tiles are empty as which tiles are filled. For example, if a row or column is a \\"1 1 1 1,\\" if you know the location of some of the filled tiles, before and after the filled tile will be an empty tile. Finding the empty tiles will help to find more filled tiles, and so on. It's an iterative process. Also, try to solve as much of the puzzle as you can before using the hints. If you use a hint early in the going, the two random tiles that are revealed may not help you very much. If you'll solve as much of the puzzle as you can before using a hint, the revealed tiles are much more likely to help you complete the puzzle.<br /><br />The model plane is a P-51D Mustang, one of the finest US fighter planes of World War II.<br /><br />The puzzles ran perfectly on my Kindle Fire HD.<br /><br />Note: The descriptions for the FlipPix puzzles indicate that the download is about half a megabyte. However, after the initial download, another download of about 10 MB is required, so make sure that you have that much storage space available.e tip for beginners: It's just as important to determine which tiles are empty as which tiles are filled.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game I even have the game on my phone and I am only 8 but I still love this game.
0385535147|4.0|This is not a great novel but for a quick read, it's fun. It starts of with a plausible, credible beginning that sucked me in. I won't go into the plot to the degree others have, but you get the idea. I felt it slowed a bit in the middle to the point that I almost tucked it away. Then the ending, not a killer climax, maybe not even credible, but nonetheless, in a Grisham way, brought me back in and proved satisfying. Enjoy.
B00112GVFO|1.0|Pretty much the perfect example of what is wrong with Hollywood movies today. Shifts effortlessly from one cliche to the next with no surprises, character development or sensible storytelling. Even the music is predicable. If you like explosions, this movie has them. If you are looking for anything else, look elsewhere.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I enjoy the starting variety of puzzles, and the feature of changing the number of pieces, so I can replay a previous puzzle. Found I had to return to the app store after an update ( which I didn't request), which stopped the app when I wanted amusement post-Hurricane Sandy.
0525953728|2.0|The majority of this book is the author patting himself on the back.  I wanted to like this book and the man who experienced the mission first hand.  I found it a dragging story.  Yes the men that performed this mission are well deserving of the highest of praise.  However, this seems like someone who was disappointed in not getting enough praise telling people why he deserves more.  In many parts of the book he talks about how the team members aren't looking for applause, but I can't believe that the author feels that way.

030758836X|1.0|A lot of opinions about this book. Why? It epically fails the 40 page rule. Dreadful self-absorbed cardboard 'characters'(that's being very charitable) described very woodenly- with not a whiff of charm or style (or discernible skill). Good god people have a lot of time on their hands to wallow through this muck. How do you stay wake? The beginning was appalling- offering absolutely no incentive  to recommend continuing. Who could get to the supposedly dreadful end? Life is much too short.<br /><br />We are trapped in an era of ineptly produced fiction that, like reality television and 'vampire' movies/tv shows and America's Got Talent! and Katy Perry, that carries the implicit message-you're doing just fine. yes you're totally miserable but look-you're not nearly as bad off as these geeks. And that's what they want you to think. They're just amazed it was that easy to lull everyone to sleep.<br /><br />If you don't demand better quality you'll never see/read/hear it. Toodles!

B0027BOL4G|5.0|I first saw this documentary on PBS and was horrified and sickened at the lengths corporations will go to to increase their profits.  Most of us have likely seen undercover videos over the years of the torment animals endure their whole, and usually short, lives for human consumption. There is so much more to be learned by watching \\"Food, Inc.\\" ... so much more than I ever imagined was happening in the food industry. Personally, as a former fan of chicken, watching the part focusing on that particular industry was extremely disturbing.  Images and sounds that are hauntingly unforgettable.  Would be hard to think that anyone who watches this will not be affected.. it is very informative and eye-opening. Thank you, Amazon, for having this available.  When more are aware, perhaps changes will be made...

B006ZS81GG|5.0|I really like lana del rey- talented, soft, melancholic depressed kind of voice yet with essence. Helps to break up the predictable mainstream music dominating the radio. Apparently she had a bad SNL performance but i enjoyed her recordings

1401322786|4.0|I don't often read books but was interested after seeing author interviewed on TV talk show.  I found it easy and interesting to read.  It is an uplifting book that reminds us of our human and spiritual elements.
B008K6DU4Y|1.0|Wont work on Kindle Fire HD.  It opens videos but kicks out with no error message after about 10 seconds.

B00846REIS|4.0|If I had not read the 50 shades trilogy this would be a lot better! Its a good book, but I felt like it was trying too hard to be like 50 shades. I'll read the next book in this series.
B007IJDXFK|5.0|Weather Systems is my first Anathema album. I have to say that it did not take but one listen to be totally and completely overwhelmed with emotions from the past, present and future.<br />Future? Yes, the future.<br />Track 9 - \\"Internal Landscapes\\" takes me into the type of mentality and struggle my parents, myself and anyone in their last moments of life will most likely experience. To me this song is incredibly touching and emotional.<br />\\"Untouchable, Part 1 & 2\\" seem to talk to me directly. These 2 songs could very easily be the soundtrack for my last relationship and to how it ended, almost 3 months ago (9/12).<br /><br />I suppose, my masochistic enjoyment of, and possible addiction to Weather Systems is based on nothing but my attachements to personal life experiences, which to me is THE REASON for searching this type of music. To be in touch with my feelings and struggles in life as well as all my successes, is imperative. Additionally, my interpretations of Anathema's insightful lyrics and musical exactitude, take me deep into melancholic and destructive battles within myself. Total mental health depends on your ability to face every single emotion your mind throws at you. Never be afraid to deal with that.<br /><br />This is why listening to \\"Weather Systems\\" needs to be a temporary experience. A short stay with sadness, emotion AND depression. Always enjoy everything in moderation. But beware of addiction to your melancholic nature, you may find yourself unable to stop listening.<br /><br />All my love to Anathema and to all of you who are fortunate enough to live harmoniously with your feelings.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|no problems whatsoever. this is a great app and is very useful. syncs with all my devices seemlessly. wouldn't change a thing
B00913P6G0|5.0|Album is nice!!!! This is the best hip hop album this year.  I listen to this album daily. Kendrick  Lamar style is different.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|Special Effects are awesome and 3D was top notch, story's a bit wack. Could have been a whole lot better.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn's GONE GIRL is a most important novel about America; she makes you think back to Bellow, Updike, and Didion in their primes.<br /><br />Disguised ingeniously and maliciously as a suspense thriller about a \\"sociopath,\\" GONE GIRL is the Profane Comedy of ever-more-mindless, wired-up America, no country for old (or young) loners in which being Original is a Sin and the already enormous, quickly growing Court Of Public Opinion, run by schlock media ever more expert at playing games primates play, is becoming the de facto law of the land. And even worse, the blaring herdspeak is becoming \\"reality.\\" As to this Vanity Fair, there is no sanity there.<br /><br />After inevitable, sour disillusionment has set in once the hopeless dream of Flawless Romance has invariably gone bad, Flynn's \\"sociopath\\" concocts a perfect spousal crime in that perp's all-too-plausible quest to impose a penal continuation of ideal marriage according to Hollywood's endless succession of \\"light romantic comedies\\" and the rest of the relentless and business-profitable love-dream huckstering in all the other familiar venues. It's a journey into the ghastly. You might have a dark dream in which Bram Stoker rewrites \\"the Bickersons.\\"<br /><br />Flynn is merciless in her disgust. Unspokenly, her savage, pitiless, resigned satire is an inspired riff on the Scott Peterson schlockfest of the previous decade, and like great jazz Flynn's story is immensely more insightful than, as well as different from, the original version. It becomes a Big Story.<br /><br />In Flynn's novel, the wife, Amy Elliott Dunne, disappears. Evidently she is pregnant. The husband, Nick Dunne, Must Have Done It; The Husband Is Always Guilty, isn't he? (Nick has a cleft in his chin: recall the old ditty, \\"Dimple on the chin, the Devil within\\"; the Devil has been \\"Old Nick\\" for centuries; \\"Dunne\\" = Done). Now in their thirties, both Nick and Amy have lost their writing jobs in the \\"futureland\\" of Manhattan after the Internet destroys the paper-publishing business in no more than a decade. Nick's sister, Go (Margo), also in Manhattan, has also lost her job, hers having been in the Financial Sector during the Great Recession. As the novel opens, the marital magic is long gone from the marriage of Nick and Amy as they live in a \\"bank-owned, recession-busted, price-reduced mansion\\" in a development of largely empty houses. Nick and Go run a tavern, The Bar, which they bought with the last of Amy's trust fund.<br /><br />The Perfect Crime in GONE GIRL is strictly contemporary. It entails a careful, complex scheme of entrapment of the other spouse sprung by attracting and masterfully manipulating the media to create a nationally devoured melodrama played out on millions of screens through superb, unerring novelistic stand-ins for the usual suspects--I can't help thinking here of Barbara Walters, Nancy Grace, Dateline, and on and on--in which that errant spouse becomes Guilty In The Court Of Public Opinion which in turn rouses the Homo sap primates en masse which in turn makes Local Law = Politics.<br /><br />GONE GIRL dramatizes not the \\"wisdom of crowds\\" but the stupidity of crowds.<br /><br />GONE GIRL is an enrapturing, dismaying and spot-on Comedy of Disgust, of Species Contempt, that is finally and necessarily a drama of self-loathing, the only possible escape being the Grand Cackle--sometimes enough to bring tears of laughter to your eyes--during Flynn's inspired satire and parody.<br /><br />Better yet, Flynn tells her story through her two major characters, the Dunnes, neither of whom is more than a little reliable, in a tour de force of modern verisimilitude; like such masters as Faulkner and Kurosawa in, respectively, LIGHT IN AUGUST and RASHOMON, the truth comes out through somewhat dubious or at least parochial and conflicting testimony and only with the active imagination of readers or viewers who must act as jurors of sorts, sifting and weighing the direct and implicit action of the novel as well as their own reactions, especially when the tale draws to a close and the comedy has become more bitter than sweet.<br /><br />Apropos: in GONE GIRL there finally seems not so much an ending as the reaching of an impasse in the Love Story, a dark State of Nature in the Gender Wars, the standing of \\"romance\\" on its head. Flynn couldn't be more up-to-date and prophetic in step with the primatologists of today who, along with others, are rather coldly reviewing human nature and \\"relationships.\\" In short, natural selection is hardly the perfect engineer, is it?<br /><br />The backdrop of GONE GIRL is drop-dead on. Flynn's wired-up America of today captures much in the Grand Surround: the Great Public has been relentlessly primed for exploitation by a comparatively small sector comprised top-to-bottom of utterly callous media schlockmeisters and their parasites such as \\"celebrity defense attorneys\\" and \\"personality journalists,\\" all of them empowered by the instantaneous ubiquity of TV and the Internet and trained by production types in turn trained by richly rewarded scientists and researchers who have demystified pop art by radically improving empirical understanding of how to manage Public Opinion: Potential concert pianists who became button pushers; no mere concert halls for them: All the world's a cage of super chimps with reliable reactions, a captive audience facing through the bars a stage upon which the schlocksters enact stupidly simpleminded dramas and then laugh all the way to the bank.<br /><br />The Ellen Abbott Show (might she be something of an amalgam of Nancy Grace and Greta Van Sustern?) begins the National Melodrama, attacking Nick, and the vast audience of super chimps jumps up and down through the instigated emotions: outrage, pity, anger, and so forth, but always within an instant of becoming converted groupies should the Guilty One Prove Innocent or Ask Forgiveness. Nick, condemned on all sides before entering any courtroom, hires celebrity lawyer Tanner Bolt. (Should you Google \\"Tanner Bolt,\\" you'll discover that it is a company specializing in anchors, which Tanner certainly does, e.g., anchors like Grace and Walters. Flynn is perhaps the first true Googler as a novelist when it comes to helping you track down allusions, understand wordplays, and similar: for example, who is \\"Madeleine Elster\\" and why does Amy refer to herself by that name?)<br /><br />To say much more here would be to commit the spoiler sin. Besides, once you've found out whodunnit and wha'happened, you'll find Flynn's fierce satirical energy underscored and thoroughly satisfying. Indeed, a second reading is most rewarding.
B009AJD5E0|3.0|Trailer was great and the movie was just okay. Better writing but nodays not too many scifi movies that come out
B00992CF6W|1.0|Minecraft is the all time worst. They just want your money. If u already bought it, try to get a retund. Did u hear me? TRY. If u cant, just like i said minecraft just wants your money.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Lots of twist and turns.  Well written but it seemed like the author didnt know how to end.  To bad.  Very dissappointing ending.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I absolutely LOVE Sylvia Day! This book was even better than the first!! I just can't get enough of Day's books!! I can't wait for the third instillation!!
B009OYSFDM|4.0|Just a few episodes in and we are enjoying Arrow.  It has the typical DC comics darkness and the actors are believable. The update to modernize the setting is good without sacrificing the core of the Green Arrow Mythos.  In all, worth your time and money so far.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|I found this book very addictive to read. My wife complained that I refused to put it down. I can't wait to move on to the third book in the series. In response to a few bad reviews for the Kindle version, there are a few typos in the Kindle version, but they in no way make the book difficult to read. Most people probably won't even notice the typos. Also, there have been several people complaining about the Epilogue coming after then end of the story. That's where an Epilogue belongs. This is not a defect with the Kindle version.<br /><br />Overall, fantastic book with great story momentum. It really keeps the pages tuning.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|This movie tries to act oh-so-sophisticated. But the story is a half-hearted attempt at a prequel. The script was inane. The acting was overdone. The only valid conclusion possible is that David is most definately a relative of Ash (Alien 1979). Wow, down to the severed head and everything. That's as good as it got. This film stinks on ice but it sure cures insomnia.<br /><br />Better off not even viewing it and just watch Alien and Aliens once again. Sorry Ridley...
B007THA4FI|2.0|A complicated story with too many characters, quickly revealing itself as the author's thinly-veiled social commentary instead of an entertaining fiction novel.  Harry Potter fans will be disappointed with this piece of work.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game not only does it include my favourite mythical creatures it also is made challenging by many different goals that need to be completed.
B0081BU42O|3.0|As a fan of Ian M. Banks culture novels, I eagerly awaited this book, but did not like it as much as most others. I found the parts of the book where the culture's coherence was frayed most interesting; a ship going native, the people of the culture being relegated to mostly an afterthought while the Minds in the ships ran the show and composed strategy, with humans being a kind of necessary sanity ballast but not really major characters.. In terms of evolution of the diffuse reality of the culture it was, I think an important step forward. And the culture's role as peace keeper, moderator of other cultures was interesting as well. But the plot was less compelling and several things went unexplained or plot points were unfinished. I will continue to read Banks' culture novels, but I think he is experimenting with what culture is and what it might become. In that sense this felt like a transitional book; musings that may coalesce into a better next book.
B000OZ0NXA|2.0|For a first novel I guess it's not horrible, but it did not meet my expectations based upon the reviews that I read before purchasing. For me, there was way too much extraneous detail. This story could have been told just as effectively in about half the number of pages.
B009LAP7OE|5.0|This is perhaps one of the best shows on television today.  I am so glad I got Season 2 for my Kindle Fire because that way I can watch whenever I want and not have to wait for a week to see a new episode!
B009NPM5Y2|4.0|I was skeptical that this movie would just be another Glee with music from the 80's. I was wrong. I was joyfully singing along to my favorite music from high school. Great musical.
B007Y612KA|4.0|If you're up for an adventure and like the 1930s 40s era this is a great film for you. Despite the whole movie being filmed in all computer graphics, it does not take away from the feel of the movie. An overall fun film for everyone to watch.
B005J2V74C|1.0|I was really hoping for something good out of this buzzy little indie horror film.<br /><br />What I got was boring and uninspired and less scary than an actual episode of Syfy's Ghost Hunters.<br /><br />Pass on this one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The next update is going to have the nether and zombie pigment I cant wait. I hope all the multiplayer glitches are fixed too.
B00913DPW2|5.0|I don't usually like point and click games but I did this one.  It was hard. The puzzle pieces were elusive but the walk through and spoilers got me through. I am looking forward to more games from Synthesis.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|There are few bigger DeMille fans, but at this point, I have to admit that I have been in denial. There isn't another Word of Honor, Charm School or Gold Coast left in him. This story could have been done in fifty pages and figured out by a fourth grader. The rest of this boring and simple waste of ink was spent with John Corey being reduced to a wise guy and nothing more. Not a detective, husband or anything else. Brenner was completely and utterly wasted. Kate? Reduced to one word answers. Honestly, his own characters should sue for malpractice.<br /><br />I think I will go re-read Nightfall, his last truly excellent work.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is really cool how I can choose any game and plyay it and they are all fun... it is also fun to see who is better me or my hubby lol
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Proof that Mumford will be around for a while as a mainstay player in the Newgrass genre. Solid tunes, great album all the way around.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This was a superbly well written and Directed movie that should appeal to all audiences. Visually breathtaking and solidly acted with just the right amount of campy humor that transferred well from the comic strips. Each actor played their characters very well and interacted with each other effortlessly. A follow-up movie will be well worth waiting for.
B007SGM084|5.0|It's truly a love story.  Love at first sight. Once I started reading I couldn't stop. Irregardless of what two consenting adults do behind closed doors....they were truly in love with each other. I really admired Ana because it wasn't about his money and power...she was genuine.....Christian saw that in her and knew she was the type of woman he needed to help him with his \\"fifty shades\\". I do think the pace of the story was too fast which made the story appear to be more of a fantasy. I would have like to have seen the main characters played out in more detail.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Call me a simpleton, but I am a fan of any kind of match-three type game.  They're good time killers, whether you have 3 minutes or 3 hours to waste.  The backstory that game makers concoct to differentiate one or the other are largely irrelevant, but Call of Atlantis goes all in with a detailed backstory that takes quite a bit of time to get through, initially.<br /><br />Once you get into game play mode, it's a very nice looking, sharp board with great graphics, high quality background music and good special effects.  The $5 cost definitely went into making a game that at least looks as premium as its price tag implies.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it's let down by a few quirks that mar the experience.  The game's crashed on me twice now, both times in various parts of the introductory portion.  During game play, it's impossible to make more than one move at a time.  This may sound silly, but in my preferred Jewels-type game, you can keep making moves while other sets of three are blown off the board; this allows for faster gameplay and the ability to 'stack' matches one after another, creating some interesting and otherwise inaccessible matches as game play progresses.  Here, you have to wait until each match is cleared before input is restored.  Grid spacing is also not ideal for the sausage-fingered among us.  I had several instances of swiping items only to have them spin in place, mocking my very competence as a player.<br /><br />Perhaps the most troubling issue I've discovered so far is that there's no way to exit the program.  Sure, you can exit the game to the main screen, and from there, there's another exit button.  But it doesn't work, at least not on my device (Galaxy S Showcase w/ version 2.3.5).  I had to hit the home key, then go into task manager and kill the game.  It's also a bit of a memory hog, apparently.  While it only shows 33 MB of memory used when I go to close it, it must use more because upon exiting, my entire home screen is missing and has to re-load.  It shouldn't be an issue for most users but for those of us loaded to the gills on older hardware it may present a problem.<br /><br />Is it worth $5?  Not really.  The graphics are great and sound quality outstanding, but it's simply too buggy and gameplay too restricted to be my #1 go-to time waster in this genre.  For that, I return time and again to The Treasures of Montezuma 2.  It graphics aren't on par with this game, but it exceeds this in all other respects.<br /><br />UPDATE: I've upgraded to an HTC Droid DNA and all the issues I experienced on my Samsung Galaxy S variant, detailed above, do not occur on this phone.  Only the \\"one move at a time\\" issue remains, and it can be rather frustrating.  So I've added a star for playability on the new device, but it still falls short of being my go-to match style game.as to re-load.

B009GEEMLY|5.0|This movie was amazing. Carefully incorporates and ties together so many characters dynamically. There is action throughout and humor entwined together.
B006VGGAC4|4.0|Loved the book. Would have given it five stars except some portions could have been a little shorter as there was such detail, on and on, that it became a little boring at times. But, all in all I was really surprized and would recomend it for sure. Sure gives you an insight into bodybuilding and makes you look at movie making in a whole different light. I'm sure glad I am not a movie star. God saved me and the world when he made me \\"not a movie star\\" Let Arnold do it.

B002LAM7PI|5.0|Had trouble viewing...when it finally showed my children enjoyed the movie. It was a great Halloween treat. I definitely suggest it.
B003CN5SAY|5.0|I've been a nip/tuck fan since it began. I was totally enthralled with the entire final season. Couldnt have asked for a better ending...
B0015DYIH2|5.0|the book was very well written. love how it ties everything together. cant wait to see breaking dawn part 2 in theatres soon.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Great Show. Love the characters and the story line. Wish the episodes were longer. Cannot wait for the next episode.
B007SGM084|4.0|Although this trilogy is full of dream-like situations, it truly isn't believable.  I guess it is a nice change in \\"romance\\" novels, but I found myself saying \\"yeah right\\" a lot. So, dream a little dream.....
B007QPFGJW|5.0|How much better can Jo Nesbo get with his writing/plots? I have read and re-read all of his books and am always sorry to arrive at the last page.  I am hoping there will be another Harry Hole story and soon. If you have not discovered this superb author, get one of his books and you will understand what all the hype is about regarding Nesbo.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|This book was all right but not her best work. The plot was a bit contrived and not very interesting. I was never sitting on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happens next.
B007EECSFA|5.0|\\"The Secret Keeper\\" is another display of Kate Morton at her finest.  The twists and turns in the story had me commenting out loud! I am eagerly awaiting the next novel from this Australian writer. Please don't keep us waiting too long.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Delightful movie, great performances by Dame Judith, Maggie Smith and ALL the others.  Colorful, set in India, humor, sadness, all rolled into one.  A statement about aging yes, and yet a statement about all ages and the gifts and strengths brought by all.  I loved it!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this every day.  The ability to \\"work math problems\\" as part of the snooze feature is a real plus.  Beats the heck out of my alarm clock.  I've tried a few other alarm clock apps but keep coming back to this.  (It is on my Kindle Fire.)
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I never have a problem connecting to facebook with any of my games on my kindle fire. you must have it blocked in your settings
B004Z98B1M|5.0|It is easy for me to relate to this picture - I'm old  with all that entails. I needed to feel needed - so now I volunteer at the hospital - at the information booth I get to tell people where to go, at the wheelchair station I push people around, and in pharmacy I get to push drugs - I think Ed Asner could relate to that.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|David Mitchell is a brilliant author.  His books are challenging but worth the effort.  I was totally immersed in this book from the beginning.
B006LSZECO|3.0|A mystery written in his story/her story style. The reader gets engaged in the husband's story as he comes home to find his front door open and his wife missing under mysterious circumstances. Soon the reader gets to know the lives of the couple from his perspective. Taken right from the headlines, we all wonder if he did it, and where the body might be hidden. Then, the wife's perspective comes into play--full of twists and turns, fast paced. A good pick for your book club, will lend itself to great discussion points.
0385737955|4.0|This was a great read! It reminded me a bit of Hunger Games but was definitely different. It had a similar feel though. I enjoyed the mystery and suspense of the book and it was nice that it was not too violent or filled with swearing since it is targeted mostly for young adults. I am in my thirties and definitely enjoyed it. I'm now 100 pages into the Scorch Trials (2nd book) and have already ordered the Kill order and Death Cure. I recommend this to anyone who enjoyed Hunger Games.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|It was an average book. But glad to read about a true American hero. Another written verson of G I Jane.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is so fun I love it if only it was the free app of the day you should get it I give it five stars.
B00138EVDK|5.0|This is what I consider \\"Classic Kansas\\". If you like hard tunes with tight harmonies that take you to another time and place.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Most of these games are fairly interchangeable but I really enjoyed this one because it the graphics are great and the progressive difficulty made it enjoyable. The music did get a bit repetitive but the controls to turn it off were simple. I played this games straight thru twice and I still play it when I need a little down time.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|interesting and readable  book ...photos  it kept moving.. dont cha love the title?? i would recommend to my friends.. a nice read.
B0012GMV4O|5.0|This is one of the first souther rock bands that I had an LP of. Yes I said LP. I have been a fan of Mountain ever since. Personally I believe that Mountain could hold their ground against any of the better known bands of that era.

030759565X|5.0|I must admit that I constantly use the recipes from the SK blog, so I was bound to like this book.  But I was also very happy going through the book that there are a wide variety of recipes and that most of them can be changed a bit so that it's really a book of starting points for even more meals. I've had the book for a few days now and am through 10 of the recipes, the butternut squash galette was outstanding, and most of the recipes were incredibly novel and easy to make. I plan on buying many copies of this book as holiday gifts, I would absolutely recommend.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Excellent sequel to the first book. Ken Foliett has been and continues to be a outstanding Author. Get this book if you read the first one....You will not be disappointed. He continues to weave facts and history into a story that is impossible to put down! Ken
B0098VXE50|4.0|Kept my attention, ran a little long in places, but a good twist on the fairy tale.  In a letter grade, I give it a B-
B0090EHVMC|5.0|This movie is really fun and the kids absolutely love it. I have three boys 6,4 and 2 and they all equally enjoy. There is a positive message in it and none of the bad guy type stuff is anything I have to worry about them copying which is great.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Absoultly loved this movie. I thought that it was great that we actually have a prequel. I wonder though if we will get a movie that explains the Predators aspect.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Interesting movie,great cinematics, but left a lot of unanswered questions.  I guess they'll be answered in the next movie.<br />The Alien Triology were more mysterious and nerve racking<br />Mr King
B007OWRBJK|1.0|It`s that time of year. Run out and buy the paperback and on a chilly evening place it between logs in the fire place and insert match. I normally do not care for autobiogs and this one ranks among the bad. Book is misstitled \\"Who Cares\\" is the feeling you are left with after reading.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|Used this app to find a bed & breakfast. Great setup with pictures and reviews that gave you information that really helped. Will use again for our next vacation.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this is a very very fun game if you are looking to a fun addicting game this is one you are looking for
B0045HCJKS|5.0|DVD came on time and was perfect. The movie was good and Yul was creepy- even considering how old the movie was.
B009GENZ12|2.0|I rented this on amazon and I thought it looked like a great thriller.  The first 20 min. or so isn't bad.  The suspense was great, I thought.  It didn't last too long before it got confusing and I had a hard time understanding what was really going on.  So, I don't think this is that great of a thriller.  I wouldn't recommend it.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|There was quite a bit of action in this last book - but it seemed to me that the characters - especially Katniss - were very wooden.  In the first two books they came alive and we could identify with all the characters.  That was gone in this book.  The plot was a little predicable too.  Don't think the characters would have put up with that stuff in the book.  But still a good read.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|we love this game.  its so fun and addicting. my nine year old can sit for hours! going to get hubby in on it too!
B00846REIS|5.0|I thought that Fifty Shades was good until I read Bared to You! All I can say is WOW! I couldn't wait to read Reflected in You and it was equally good!
0446547646|2.0|I won't bother anyone who happens to read my review with a further summary of the story. There are already so many well written ones posted that there's no need for another one.  What I'll try to do is write down some points that didn't sit well with me. Maybe those who haven't read the book won't be able to fully understand my argumentations -  sorry about that!<br /><br />Any book written by Sparks is an absolute \\"must\\" for me. I love the atmosphere he usually creates and I think that his plots are usually interesting, usually offering some twists or turns that characterize his story lines and his heroes/heroines are usually interesting personalities. However, nothing of this happened in this book.<br /><br />ATTENTION: Spoilers!<br /><br />Firstly, there were several \\"spiritual elements\\" involved in the plot. No matter how expertly Sparks handled these elements, unfortunately I'm not a big fan of \\"paranormal\\" and \\"spiritual\\" elements. Especially if these are fundamental to the plot. For those who have already read the book, I'm referring to the \\"man wearing the windbreaker\\". His interference was essential to the plot, a fact I didn't appreciate at all. Who was he anyway? An angel of revenge? A ghost? On the other hand I could easily \\"forgive\\" any spirituality around Tuck and Clara, which was very nicely put and full of atmosphere.<br /><br />Secondly, I'm not a very religious person. More specifically, I do believe in God but I'm not somebody who could quote any verses from the Bible.  However, if I recall the religious education at school correctly, God was always referred to as being forgiving. Hence, I had a difficult time with the sentence that implied that God took a life for a life. Especially if taking into consideration that Dawson was involved in a deadly ACCIDENT, which according to Tanner wasn't really investigated properly.  It was an accident - not a murder.  So how could the \\"man wearing the windbreaker\\" decide that Dawson's life was less worth than Alan's? Again: What was his role? A ghost? Angel of revenge? What?!<br /><br />Thirdly, I thought that the villains were badly elaborated. Yes, they were essential to the plot but I didn't really understand their driving force, nor did I grasp their motivation. OK, they were evil - fine but why exactly? And what - did they just wake up one day being bad? What exactly made them bad? Did they realize it? Did they fight being evil?<br /><br />Dawson: The poor guy. He was born into a \\"difficult\\" family but tried very hard to make the best of it - without success however. It just didn't sit well with me that an accident destroyed his life.  I would've expected a book with such disposition towards Christian literature to give him a second chance during his lifetime and not in his afterlife. What about absolution? Forgiveness? Mind you it was an accident!<br /><br />Amanda: She met the love of her life when she was very young but she didn't grasp it tightly. OK, her parents intervened and terminated Amanda's and Dawson's relationship but what did she do later on, when she matured? She didn't chose to meet Dawson again but preferred to get married to Frank only to think on the day of her marriage that it would be Dawson to whom she would get married to!!??  Know what?! If she really loved Dawson wouldn't she try to find him before marrying somebody else? Isn't this immoral? How come Dawson was \\"punished\\" and not Amanda?<br /><br />Finally, I thought that the ending of the book and its epilogue weren't complementary. Furthermore, I was disappointed at the glimpse I caught at Amanda's life or what she chose to do with it<br /><br />All in all, I'm not sure I can recommend this book easily. It surely had its good moments but I think the bad ones prevailed. What a pity!!Alan's? Again: What was his role? A ghost? Angel of revenge? What?!<br /><br />Thirdly, I thought that the villains were badly elaborated.

0316228532|5.0|I have to be honest I had only read the first Harry Potter book, and thought \\"if I was ten years old I probably would have really enjoyed that\\", but I haven't been inclined to read any more.  Curiosity moved me to buy A Casual Vacancy, and I'm so glad I did, I couldn't put it down, initially it seems to start like the typical AGA SAga, set in an English village, but it's so much more than that, darker, but there are some seriously funny  moments, and the many twists in the plot, before an in your face ending, don't sant to spoil it by saying more.  The characters are great, so totally beleivable and of the age.  I'm almost inclined to try a few more HP books.
B0096DFBZQ|3.0|Fun but hard to control. Especially for younger ones. The graphics are great and appealing to the eye. Would love to have the original pac-man game.
B008OOYALE|5.0|The one thing I like most about this game compared to other story games is the fact that nothing expires if left too long. Unlike restaurant story or pet shop story where something will go bad or get sick . Not everyone can play these games all day everyday. Some people work for a living and try to raise a family. A+++ in my book!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book, i literally couldn't put it down. However, it reminds me of a generic brand of 50 shades of grey. It is still a good book and i recommend it to anyone who liked 50 shades of grey.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This match three game has incredible graphics, designed for steady, but fun gaming.  It keeps you glued to your phone or tablet.
B00846REIS|5.0|@ first thought it was a lot like 50 Shades but then after getting into their stories very good.. both partners have demons they fight with ! A must read book !
B009FOBZL0|4.0|Solid disc.  Really enjoy most of the songs.  Especially the tracks with Mick Jones.  If you like The Wallflowers you will like this disc.
B004LROUNG|3.0|It has been awhile since I had read a Grisham novel.  He has gotten s good bit better since he began.  He has excellent, interesting stories.  His style is like a good story-teller sitting by a fireplace telling a story.  His writing style is not what I would call highly literary, meaning that he does not make much use of figures of speech or go very deep into his characters' psychology. Nor, does he make much use of non-standard elements of style such as punctuation or incomplete sentences.  He just tells a straight forward story.  But, he keeps me turning the pages!!  Good work, John.
B0049U4NQO|5.0|I get these books on kindle and book copy very good books. If you like these books get all of then
B009JNXK88|4.0|It's a fun 8bit game kind of like Splosion Man where you go through a level killing scientists. The controls are about as good as you can get on a touch device but still hampers the game play some. If this was on Xbox like Super Meat Boy which I think is similar in gameplay and graphics I would probably buy it again.
B000TO0TCQ|5.0|I read all Alex rider books very good I get all new books when they come out  You will like them
B009PMEEY2|1.0|For some reason this app caused my Fire HD to overheat dramatically, it would shut completely down. I called Amazon and asked for a refund, which I received.<br /><br />I've had the iPhone and iPad version of Azkend and it's a fun game. It just doesn't play nice with the Fire.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Witty and sarcastic John Corey is back on another assignment. A little gory at the end of the book but I think it is realistic to the culture DeMille is writing about. Highly recommend it based on the plot, action and wit.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very easy to understand quick and fun My granddaughter and I each download game and compete with each other great fun
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I'm very impressed with this cover. It has a nice feel to it and it's very well made.  I'm using it with my Kindle Fire, and while at first I had my doubts whether or not it would fit into the elastics, I was able to get it in.  My Kindle feels secure and looks great.  The top flap will flip open a full 360 degrees and it can also be used to prop up your Kindle if you're watching a movie. There's enough room in the inside spine to clip a stylus and it will still close perfectly.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who is careful with their Kindle.  If you have small kids that use it, or are accident-prone you may want to get a zippered cover that offers more protection.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|Must read for any halo fan. Gives great insight into the master chief and his beginnings. Also recommended the rest of the books.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Okay let's begin with hero movies, back in the days of Superman with Christopher Reeves. Great movie, no doubt. In the last decade Hollywood has put out more superhero based movies; some are good, some are bad. All Marvel heroes are tied together at some point in the comic world but in a movie? How would that work? So many characters, so little time to give each one their spotlight.<br /><br />Problem solved by simply watching this movie. The movies Thor, Iron man, The Incredible Hulk, Captain America all had ties to something that was boiling in its pot. We got a glimpse of it every time a new hero movie came out. Each movie had done very well in their own making but the Avengers takes it onto the next level. It is time for all who can defend the Earth to come forth. Thus they do but not so easily and no one thought it would be so easy. None of the characters lose any of their aspects in this movie and it even expands a little more on them.<br /><br />Joss Whedon had a hand in this movie which doesn't mean anything to some people but he has created masterpieces before and this is another example. I have never sat through a movie entirely wanting to listen to every word, nothing bored me in this movie. When the climax came it was glorious. They actually did it and made the Climax exactly how it should have been.<br /><br />The movie was the best I have seen in a long time. I bought this movie and it is 1 of 2 that I have bought in the last year. It surpassed my expectations and drove me into the internet to find out more and more information on the heroes.<br /><br />I am not a comic book reader but this movie was able to fascinate me into that universe. The only problem with this movie is that it ends.
B009KHCT94|3.0|It was no Rocky Horror, but it's okay if you like camp and have some time to kill. The Nazis were a little weak and ill-prepared, considering they had the expertise to build a civilization on the moon with 65+ years of preparation to conquer Earth. Think Mars Attacks and Space Balls....
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I absolutely love this game! its amazing! it keeps me completely entertained no matter where I am. whether I'm home, in study hall, or in the car :)
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Excellent cast ,as well as well written. The best modern on screen \\"Hulk\\" to date. One of the best \\"comic\\" movies made yet!
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is the best game out there it is amazing I could spend 20+ hours playing it<br /><br />MINCRAFT=ME ADDICTID!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Ps.now just make a formula 1 2012 game and I bet you millions of people will buy it.
B009JNXK88|4.0|Thanks amazon for making it free I loved this game on ios and now its time to start over on fire great stuff.
B008M4MB8K|3.0|The viewable content of this package is nearly identical to the 25th anniversary 5-disc set.  None of the movie versions or extras have been improved in any way (it was rumored that \\"Dangerous Days\\" would be upgraded to 1080p for this release - not true, it's still 480p).<br /><br />No content was dropped, which is a good thing (I'm always mystified when a new release comes out with less content, especially when what was dropped was of value).  All commentaries, featurettes, etc. remain.<br /><br />New to this package are about 1,000 still photos.<br /><br />The artwork has changed dramatically.  It's packaged as a \\"36 page hard cover book presentation\\", and now comes on 3 BD discs rather than 3 BD discs + 2 standard DVD's, so the contents have been re-arranged somewhat.<br /><br />If you don't own BR at all, this would be an excellent package to buy.<br /><br />If you've bought BR in the past, you have to decide whether the minimal changes are worth your money.
B00A11AN6O|4.0|This app is great I love the picture viewer definitely replaces the standard gallery app. Make more original apps amazon!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Great game!!! Cant put it down!!! I recommend it to everyone who needs a game to help pass the time, good luck trying not to get addicted.
1619692368|2.0|This review is for the audiobook:<br />I enjoy Ellen, I love watching her show and her past comedy concerts but I think she should stop writing books.  Ellen has had a lot happen to her since her last book and it would have been great to read about that. But Ellen can't seem to do that or purposefully chooses no to.  This isn't  really a memoir nor is it really a comedy cd.  Like others have posted a lot of the anecodotes she refers to can be found on her show.  The difference here is that on the show she was going through the comedy routine complete with inflections, tone, and timing.  So what we are left with is Ellen essentially reading off jokes that fall flat without the comedy dressing.  While this was okay the first time around it isn't fun the third time around.  This type of \\"memoir\\" is common with comedians who inject a little nonsense and comedy in the midst of telling their tale.  Ellen's style of comedy has always been her ADHD way of tellling jokes but it really only lands when she's on stage telling these jokes.  Not playing narrator.
B004KPQK2S|5.0|I've seen this movie at least 5 times.  It is so heart warming.  It is one of my \\"go to\\" movies when I just want to sit and smile.
B001UG56ES|5.0|This is a incredible movie, with adventure, drama, the whole works. The music is great, the scenery is dominating, the dialog is a little lacking, but cowboys are loners and do not talk much (until they get a few beers or shots in them), so, its quite \\"right on\\". You have to watch it several times to really \\"get it\\", just as any great movie (I have watched \\"Easy Rider\\" hundreds of times). This movie is long, but I never got bored in it.  The aboriginal spirituality is facsinating, the love story, the jealousies, the grip the young boy has on you is overpowering. It is a keeper for my movie library.
B007M45PMU|5.0|This is a really unique and quality album. The lyrics and lyrical styling are really special. Love that this \\"local\\" band is really hitting the airwaves.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have had the You Version Bible App on my phone for almost all of the year and a half I have owned my Android phone.  I just added the app to my Kindle Fire and love it even more. The screen is so easy to read and I carry that now instead of my \\"real\\" Bible to church.  I do still carry a notebook for sermon notes. You can make notes and bookmark pages or passages in the app but it's a bit more complicated than just quickly writing down a point you want to keep.<br /><br />There are so many versions of the Bible available that you can find exactly what you want - or easily compare passages in different versions as you read and study. I especially like the \\"reading plans\\" that are available.  There are different studies and reading plans of different lengths to meet all your needs.  I am just beginning my 2nd \\"Through the Bible in One Year\\" plan.  I would recommend the Bible App to anyone.  It's great!
B004HAG40O|5.0|I listen to this album nonstop. Not sure how it took me so long to get on board to The Decemberists! Excellent tracks esp 1, 4, 6 & 7 which are my personal favorites. Enjoy!
B007Y5IAV0|3.0|the case was in bad shape like it was tossed to the floor to many times the cd is fine theres no scartches
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|This is a fun kids movie that is actually quite touching when you see a mean man become vulnerable and start to see what is really important in life.
B0000549B0|3.0|A black comedy that I found HUMORLESS, for the most part. IS Elwood Dowd (JAMES STUART) MENTALLY ILL, an ALCOHOLIC or BOTH?? In reading the reviews, I was glad to read there are others (not many) who don't like this film either. A grown man who is so obviously detached from reality that sees, talks to and is accompanied by a 6 foot invisible rabbit--his only friend????? This movie has always been represented as a funny classic everyone should see. I was GREATLY DISAPPOINTED! BORING!
B000V63CI0|5.0|i have both albums and working on his other album. since i heard 2 outa of 3 ain't bad . i really like his music. i will keep buying more albums.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Excellent finish to the series ....I was very pleased with the ending, phenominal writing by Suzanne Collins, I look forward to her other books
B005HJU7HA|5.0|It brought back old times.  I loved the Hound of the Baskervilles. Some of the stories I have never heard of.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|you may not understand this book at first. once you get into it though, it is hard to put it down.  it is about  a girl in the future. the world has blown up so now there is only twelve districts  left.  there used to be thirteen districts, but district thirteen rebelled. as a reminder, the capitol made something up called the hunger games. the hunger games is where two kids twelve to eighteen get called to the capitol to fight to the death. in this book you will find a brave girl named Katness Everdeen. even though she is brave she also doesnt always fallow the laws.  who will get picked? will get picked(I already know, but...) will Katniss, will Prim, a younger sister of Katness, of could someone elts. ypu have to read the book to find out.  parents, this is not as inapropret as you  might think. it is full  of loyl people, evil people and geeat skill. dont turn this book down when you get a chance to read it.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|I enjoy watching and this movie over and over. I think it was a worthwile purchase. I enjoy it each time I watch and if you have children they will like it as much. I can't wait for Part 2 to come out.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I bought this to protect my kindle from anything hitting it landing on it ETC. I did not need one to hold it in a certain position so I can read. I am perfectly capable of holding it myself. I have no problem removing it from the case to charge it either. It works for me,especially for the price.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I have read all of Nelson DeMille's books and enjoy all of them.  The Panther not only kept me guessing the outcome, I learned quite a bit about Yemen, the CIA, Homeland Security and how all of the different bureaus work or don't work together.  Yemen is a world little of us really know about and after reading Mr. DeMille's description, I don't think I will be visiting any time soon.  I really like John Corey's wit or sarcasm, whichever term you desire.  I like the fact that he has a great sense of timing and bravery.  Sometimes in the description of John Corey, you don't expect for him to be as smart as he really is or quite as bold and brave as he always turns out to be.  That's why this character is fun to me.  I don't think I will ever get tired of reading Mr. Demille's books.  Thank you!
B0078XHAB4|5.0|Beautiful easy read, lovely from beginning to end. Recommend this book .<br />Good story line, very easy to get into
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books.  Loved everyone of them.  I thought that her latest book, The Bone Bed, was a little weak.  I enjoyed reading it, but it seemed to me she was too formulaic and it just wasn't as exciting as some of her other novels in the past.  Regardless of this, I do like her style and I particularly enjoy the descriptions of Kay Scarpetta's job as coroner.  Thank you Ms. Cornwell.  Keep them coming.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Definitely did not expect some of the events but a great read and very enlightening. I am sure there are many who can put themselves in the character's positions and emotions.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I don't collect a lot of apps for my Kindle Fire but this app, a way to access Pinterest, really got my attention. It's very easy to use and lets me pin my latests enthusiasms wherever I go. I've certainly used it five times more than any other app on Kindle.
156224003X|5.0|This an excellent and interesting book. it has tips for the new and old musicians. Tips about attitude and discipline!!! I recommend this book!!
B000Y96EWK|5.0|Its unusual that any trilogy of movies turn out good fun with all 3 attempts. We can't wait till the legacy movie comes out dec. 11th...its going to be added to our library immediately.
B009VB97EY|5.0|I thought this movie was great. The actors were perfect and oh so steamy. Lots of fun moments and a good look inside.
B000Q7B8FS|5.0|Great fun movie....make sure you have a good sound system for all the bourne movies....action action action and a lot of fun.
B0094OLFUW|5.0|The XX has not let me down yet. Their music is super sexy and always full of emotion and longing.
B008OOYALE|4.0|i really like it. its fun entertaining, and doesnt freak out on me. i can leave it for a few days and it doesnt matter i really love it.
B008NAFU9A|5.0|Great little story.  Lovely addition to the first book, enriching the world.  Characters were very well-written for such a short story.  Looking forward to seeing more of Ophelia.
0810996596|5.0|Excellent Book, Great pictures of some rare and one of a kind Horror Items and Movie Posters. A must for any Horror or Science Fiction fan. Just wish there was a little more on the history and value of some of these rare items.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was very well written, very interesting, makes me have a better understanding of what our service men and women do for us
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|Just buy it. You won't regret it. This movie is great if your looking for some action and a great story.
B0058YPGSY|4.0|Very good buy, but you really need to watch from season on to really appreciate this show.  I hope the writers don't run it in the ground.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This was a big help in preparing my first book for release on Kindle. Clear and concise, easy to understand. I highly recommend it if you're formatting your book for distribution on Kindle devices.
B007WKEM8C|3.0|The book itself is fabulous and I'm really excited about all the new recipes, but the Kindle edition needs some serious editing. I bought the Kindle Edition mainly to read in my Kindle Paperwhite, and it is not pretty.<br /><br />Some issues in the Kindle Edition:<br />* light text in areas such as recipe lists and blurbs before recipes is nearly impossible to read<br />* some of the text should be centered, but the first line is off-center<br />* some text runs into the images at the beginning of a recipe<br /><br />The content of the book is wonderful, but after dealing with the Kindle version I wish I had bought the hardcover.<br /><br />Whoever was in charge of formatting the ebook edition needs to clean up their code and issue a correction. You're making Deb look bad!
031265068X|2.0|I was going to try to review the book on its merits and stay away from the ethics and integrity of Marc Rich, but there were sections of the book where I was completely disgusted with Marc Rich's `money first' and `I'm above the law' mentality and his flagrant disregard for the laws of the United States. Trading oil with the hostile Iranian government while they held Americans as hostage was treasonous and criminal, even though Rich never stood trial.<br /><br />I thought the book started off very interesting when the author covered Rich's early career and the early history of oil trading. Once the author covered the Iranian hostage crisis, the book went downhill fast. The author either had severe MAN LOVE for Rich or Rich paid the author for a powder puff PR piece. The author treated this alleged criminal with kid gloves, throwing Rich softball questions and avoiding touchy subjects. The book even went as far as having a chapter that explains how Rich's criminal actions actually helped the US and Israel. C'Mon man!! Give us a break.<br /><br />It is still hard to believe that Monica Lewinsky's boyfriend actually pardoned Rich. As an American citizen, Rich allegedly disobeyed laws forbidding him from dealing with South Africa and Iran, yet Rich hid behind the paper shield of being a Swiss corporation. He should have been held accountable and stood trial. If he was acquitted, so be it, but at least he should have stood trial. Bill Clinton had his head screwed on backwards for this one.<br /><br />The author did an excellent job of writing a major puff piece for Rich, unfortunately it is the reader who gets cheated out of reading the real truth about Rich.
B009G8GRX6|4.0|Muse continues to make good music. Really enjoyed this album. Different sound but they pull it off nicely. Overall good album.
B003K16P3M|5.0|This book is brilliant. It help you to understand certain things and the characters are so relatable definately one of my all time favorite books.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|John Corey never ceases to make me smile and LOL!! He is zany but brave and smart when it comes to danger!  Just my type of book.  Gotta love Nelson DeMille too for making John so lovable! It a long book but a must read!!!!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this is a great app. I use it constantly. I always know how long my battery has until it dies! I love this!
B004GYY714|4.0|I wanted to be able to play local and not so local radio stations with my Kindle Fire in places you can't get reception or don't have electricity for a geezer radio like in the bathroom while getting ready.  It also has great choices of podcasts.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Love Jack Reacher.  He is the best character going. I look forward to all the Reacher books. One thing about Reacher is you never know what's next.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|The story is rich with futuristic and fantasy world details. The narrative kept me engaged and moved along nicely. It really wads fun ride.

B0077DN4DS|4.0|This is an excellent movie...little over the top I understand from folks who were familiar with that part of the NY scene. In any event, the embellishments only helped to make the movie more riveting. But like lots of movies of that era, it has an ending which you have to \\"guess\\" what the point was, therefore I had to demote it to four stars. Some people like that sort of thing, find it \\"artsy,\\" but I prefer closure. Maybe someone can tell me what the business at the end of the movie was all about...apparently, even the Director said he didn't know.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was an excellent read. Once I started it I found I couldn't put it down. The book gives the reader insight not just into the raid itself in Islamabad, but the joys, frustrations and hardships endured by America's heroes. Be prepared for an all-niter once you begin reading.

B004J4WN0I|5.0|Atticus O'Sullivan is the last of the Druids. While he looks 21 thanks to his herbal blend of Immortali-Tea, he is in fact 2100 years old.<br />While O'Sullivan would prefer to lead a simple life, selling his herbal blends and new age books, he has been hounded for his entire life by the Celtic God Angus Og. Atticus has in his possession a magic sword which the God Og has  coveted for almost 2000 of O'Sullivan years.  Atticus is tired of running and likes his life in Arizona and his current friends. Thinking it is  time to make a stand, O'Sullivan is in fact being manipulating by other powerful Celtic Gods and giving him no choice in the matter.  A rousing start to a new series, filled with action, adventure and whimsical comedy!

B0034G4P8A|5.0|Probably the thing I enjoyed the most about this movie, apart from the luscious visuals, was that the storyline seemed to follow most closely the traditional Norse myths that I learned when I was young. Fantastic.

B003XYERRM|4.0|A well-written book with excellent historical background.  It holds your attention and gives a more  balanced picture of Richard III than is customary.  He is not [\pictured as the evil \\"crookback\\" of  the Tudors.  It is a little long but none the less it is fascinating.<br />  Arden Frederick

B008Q09K2U|4.0|I enjoyed this book,not one of his best but kept me reading.I have read all of Nelson's books and was happy that he wrote some new ones. A little more at the end would have been good.

B003TSEEDY|3.0|This book seemed short, however it was the first book that I read on my new Kindle Fire, so that may have been why.  I mostly downloaded this book for the quotes in the book like \\"we accept the love we think we deserve\\".  I have not seen the movie yet but I will most likely compare the book to the movie.  All in all it was a decent read, I got a little sentimental on it.

B005LAIHY0|2.0|The movie may have been able to stand on its own if it hadn’t tried to cash in on Alien. Like most movies none can match the first and this one created a hype that was non existent. If you want this movie expecting to see how Ripley’s nightmare started you’ll be seriously disappointed. If you never seen or cared for the Alien movies but like SciFi and Darwinian theory you may enjoy it. Personally I’d like my money back.

B0076DCT2G|4.0|It has been a few years since I read a John Corey book...and I was not disappointed. He is in fine form as his usual wise-cracking self. It is a little embarrassing when you are at the gym and start laughing out loud at some of the dialogue. I also enjoyed learning more about a country that I knew little about, Yemen.  The historical facts alone made this book a good read. Again, as usual,the FBI does not get along with the CIA and neither of them really get along with the former military/police detectives...but that only adds to the fun of the book.  The only part that I thought we got cheated on was the ending.  There is no telling of how they got out of the country to reunite in NYC.

B0076DCT2G|3.0|I'm a huge Demille fan. Especially the John Corey series. I found this book a disappointment. I usually like the dry humor of the character, but found it to be aserbic in this book, not really witty. Also, I found much of the dialogue to be very repetitive. Not much action, and a not very intimidating villain. I almost felt like the whole book was just a setup for yet another book.

B00A1ZW1JC|5.0|Best performance from Andrew Lincoln. Nobody is going to be able to watch this episode and not get at least teary eyed. This is the best episode so far of season 3. This episode makes you wonder what the rest of the season is going to be like.

B003AVPV1O|3.0|It does the job. Intended for a mirror display it worked however the display was poor in quality. It was showing fine and did the job however the quality in the display was bad. For the inexpensive price, you get what you pay for and it does the job and it is not a complete waste. Do not purchase if you are searching for a high resolution, high quality display.

B003Y5H4YI|3.0|This worked as a straightforward spy thriller.  The aftermath did not work for me.  Be careful not to read any spoilers or plot summary about this one.  Trying to imagine how you would react in the same situation is the whole fun of the experience.  It needed much more on the 2 older men and less on the older woman.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I had actually purchased many of Jillian's other DVDs prior to finally jumping on the 30 Day Shred bandwagon - however, while she says that the workouts are \\"around 30 minutes\\" on the others - they are more like 45 & sometimes I just don't have that kind of time - so when a friend of mine said this workout was only 20 minutes, I thought it would be great on those days that I can just barely fit in a workout!<br /><br />Now, I am not in tip top of shape so I have not moved up from Level 1 & at times, I do have to take a little bit of a break even when she says not to - but, after just a week, I have been able to keep up much better and do most all of the exercises for just as long as she tells you to - so I know that my body is getting stronger and building stamina, if nothing else - so, if you feel like you are going to die, just take a break & believe me - if you keep with it, YOU WILL quickly find yourself not needing to break so often.<br /><br />I have not looked thru the other levels workouts, but I am sure that they are even more challenging than Level 1 & I look forward to the day that I build myself up to take them on!

B0083SBM7Q|5.0|This was a great deal with both the DVD and Blu-Ray, with none of the nonsense that normally comes with these things.  I don't need a digital copy with all the DRM involved, etc, just give me the movie, and an extra copy in DVD so I can watch it when I don't have a Blu-Ray player handy.  This gave me exactly what I wanted with nothing I didn't at a price that was very reasonable.  I'd recommend anybody looking for a copy of this file buy this version.  Oh, and it was a great film by the way....if you haven't seen it yet I would HIGHLY recommend it.  Joss Whedon does a great job bringing all these heroes together and not letting any of them outshine the others, each having their own unique and compelling backstory.  If you are a fan of superhero or action movies at all, pick this one up.

B004G5ZY7E|5.0|Exciting story, great characters. I couldn't put it down, and I can't wait to see the movie version. This was the first Harry Hole novel I'd read, and I immediately downloaded another when I finished this one. It didn't reference old stories, so it seems like it wouldn't matter what order you read them in.

B009ZQBZZE|5.0|I loved The Cape, but every episode, I saw it as..not quite being mainstream enough to survive.  Sure enough, it didn't.  The Arrow on the other hand I think can appeal to anyone, comic book fan or not.  In fact, for many watchers, I'm fairly confident that its just a well crafted action series with some attractive women, bits of drama here and there, wealthy family power struggles, secret societies, etc etc, all the stuff that should make a successful series. The fact that it happens to be based off of a comic book character is meaningless, except to those who are probably thinking \\"how the heck did they make Green Arrow cool?\\", because he really really is cool in this series!

B008QE9VJI|4.0|Being a fan of the original 1960's series - but even more of a fan of the 1991 remake series on NBC, it took a couple of viewings for me to \\"get it\\". Depp is not bad as Barnabas. He is missing a certain intensity, depth and clarity, but<br />overall Depp has enough of a command of the character to carry this movie. There is just too much background, family history and missing character development to try to pack into one movie. Critical plot points are glossed over, missing or not fleshed out enough for us to to really get involved with Barnabas, Roger Collins, Carolyn and David the way we should.<br />I love the porcelain doll effects on Angelique - totally amazing. I also love the Liverpool segments in the beginning.<br />Maybe a 3hr movie would've translated better, but I give Tim Burton and Depp very high marks for decent film....

B003ZWTGKU|5.0|One of the most exceptional productions I have ever seen. Truly one of my favorites. All roles and superbly cast, the production itself is classically beautiful, like a watercolor, and the singing is excellent. Kaufmann is the most complex and compelling Werther I have ever seen. Truly a production which will not disappoint. As a classical musician, the state of the arts can prove rather disparaging and this production always renews my faith in how important it is to create and tell beautiful stories which transcend time.

B004DI7HZ6|4.0|If you like sophisticated stories about witches, vampires and magic, you will like this book. Although, there are parts of the book that drag on a bit, it's generally well written, entertaining and flows well. There are a lot of characters to keep track of, but the author does a nice job of keeping the focus on the main characters througout. It's a unique love story that will leave you wanting more at the end.
B00846REIS|5.0|Sylvia Day's trilogy makes for satisfying read. Not as pornful as 50 shades, but has all the perfect components... handsome rich guy, sassy girl and a somewhat suspenseful plot
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Unlike many, I had never heard of The Hunger Games until it was being advertised.  There's always danger in book-to-film adaptions, but for me, simply but this was a entertaining flick.  Somewhat teenie-bop, but (of course) the subject matter wast pretty serious and the effects visually stimulating enough to keep my attention.  Looking forward to seeing part two/three in the coming years.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome everyone should get it you play tons of games and there all great I love it and you should to
B004RKXNDU|5.0|i got the book Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy after seeing the new movie. I enjoyed the film so much I had to read the book. It is wonderful. George Smiley is a character you grow to care for and want to know more about. The cold war setting brings me back to my teen years and is most interesting. A great story of how spies really work and live. I highly recommend it.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I have not seen the director's cut yet. It feels like the theatrical release may have left some of the plot on the cutting room floor. Perhaps I was expecting too much of a film that is primarily action and effects, but I thought it was marketed as more of a science fiction piece.  The effects did not get in the way of the story, but the story could have used some help, if felt a bit too minimalistic for my tastes.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|After seeing The Avengers 5 times and still liking the movie, I finally purchased a copy.  Before the first viewing, I couldn't imagine how a movie could use all those super heroes and do any justice to a decent storyline.  After seeing the movie, I was impressed by the acting, writing, and the special effects. The editing of the film was superb.  I would see it again (in fact, I have!), and I would invite my friends over for a movie night to see it together.  The Avengers was a fun action film, full of surprises, and what is not to like about a happy ending?
1469984202|5.0|Just finished the Wool Omnibus and will next read its prequel First Shift Legacy and then start the Molly Fyde stories.

B008220B0C|3.0|Certainly part of the charm of this documentary is the personality and charisma of Katy Perry herself.  Some will be disappointed to find out that this is not a concert film, although there are significant clips taken from various venues during her 2011 world tour.<br /><br />What we see primarily is a lot of backstage activity and show preparation interspersed with short interview clips from those closest to her.  While certainly the film has the self-promotion feel, it doesn't duck the trials and tribulations of being a star.  The interviews do not include any with Russell Brand, but we do get to see Perry's reaction to their final breakup.  It isn't pretty and yes the show must go on.<br /><br />There isn't a heavy dose of Perry's early life, although there is a smattering of clips of her as a teenager performing mostly religious songs.  Perhaps most surprising is that she was able to extricate herself from the cultural isolation imposed by her travelling preacher parents.  Even if you aren't a big fan, you won't be bored.  Still this is a film aimed at Katy Perry's target audience and I suspect they will enjoy it.<br /><br />I watched this on the 2-D Blu ray but there is a 3-D version as well.  The video comes with 1080p resolution and a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  The video quality varies somewhat, primarily because of a variety of original material.  The concert footage is first rate, complete with colorful razzle-dazzle like Perry herself.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and is first rate as you might expect.  Plenty of surround and excellent bass for your subs.  Here is a list of extras:<br /><br />\\"Last Friday Night\\" Full Concert Performance<br />\\"Waking Up in Vegas\\" Full Concert Performance<br />Grandma: An extended scene of Katy with her grandmother.<br />The Grammy's You'll Never Take Away From Me: Grammy preparation.<br />California Dreams Tour: Behind the Scenes (1080p): A six-part feature.<br />DVD Copy.<br />UV Digital Copy.

B0087ITC56|4.0|After a series of mainstream action flicks, Denzel Washington stretches his acting chops again as Whip (really?) Whitaker, a seasoned pilot for a regional airline.  Whip is so good at what he does, that he also manages to bed one of his flight attendants (stunning Nadine Velazquez) and gets plastered the night before seemingly without consequence.<br /><br />Hung over as he is, he straightens out by polishing off warm beer with a couple lines of cocaine as a chaser.  I don't know if that works in the real world but it does for Whip.  Some of the TV ads give the impression that Whip is a hero by pulling off a Sullenberger landing maneuver (he does) but is being hounded because of a small amount of alcohol was found in his system.  Make no mistake this guy was hammered and should not be flying.<br /><br />Still with the help of a little vodka, he manages to control a doomed airliner saving the vast majority of the passengers.  Unexpectedly once the NTSB/FAA begins their investigation, Whip feels invincible and doesn't slow down.  Washington performance stands out of course.  He plays a realistic drunk and seems to have all the facial tics, bobs and wrinkles on full throttle.  Washington gets plenty of supporting help along the way.  Kelly Reilly is a reformed druggie that gets involved with Whip after a hospital meet.  Brian Geraghty is Whip's born again co-pilot. Tamara Tunie is the supervising flight attendant and longtime friend.  Bruce Greenwood is Whip's union chief.  Melissa Leo is the lead federal investigator.  Don Cheadle is his lawyer and John Goodman brings some needed comedic relief as Whip's \\"Goodtime Charlie\\" supplier.<br /><br />It all works, including the great flight scenes leading up to the crash and some well-placed rock classics.  Director Robert Zemeckis must be the go to director when it comes to simulating plane crashes.  Remember the dizzying ocean ditch in \\"Cast Away?\\"  \\"Flight\\" is a first class drama filled with excellent performances that follows an extraordinary opening sequence.llows an extraordinary opening sequence.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Demille has written many great novels in the past, as well as turning to action over the last few years.  Like many action writters I've read recently, he gets better & better. The protaganist, John Corey is very funny, spitting out smart alec comments on every page.  I laughed out loud at many of them.  The husband and wife teaming works well.  I learned more of the mid-east in this book.  The action is tense and plentiful.  Buy it, you;ll like it.  On Kindle...

B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I find this game fun and frustrating at the same time. The combinations of parts will allow different stars to be earned based on said combinations. The various functions of pieces cause different effects when tested. It is definetly puzzle-lovers need to download.
B0031R5K72|5.0|Loved it from start to finish. Beautifully written and very touching. Thoroughly recommend this book you will not be disappointed.
B009329Y30|5.0|For the most part, anytime I watch a movie based on a book I read, I end up walking away disappointed, but not with this one. I really enjoyed it, and I thought it was very sweet. I love seeing characters from my favorite books brought to life. The story itself is unique, which is of course what you would expect from Nicholas Sparks. I definitely recommend it, in fact I'll probably end up owning it, which says a lot!

B003O86FMW|5.0|I Loved Hunger Games but for some reason the more I read of Catching Fire the harder it was to put down.  I read the last half of it in one day because I just couldn't stop reading it til the end.  Now I'm on to the last book of the series. What a great story.  Kept me on the edge of my seat. Loved it.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Kept your interest until the very end.  Excellent read! This was my first experience with this<br />author and I will now read her other books.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I liked this game at first, but it moves a little slow for me and seems to require very little skill, which may be good for some people looking for a diversion with very little thought process required.  Once you've expended all your coins, you have to painstakingly wait until they build up again (or you can buy coins by trading in prizes, or use actual money -- though how ridiculous is that to spend real money just to play a game with no real prizes??)  However, as you build up your prizes, you can earn more coins, but it takes a long while to reach that level, and by then I will be bored with this game.  I hope they modify it so it is a little faster-paced and the coins generate quicker in the beginning.  I would think they'd want to build up their fan base by keeping your interest in the game early on.
B008Y1YJZY|5.0|My family loves Arthur Christmas.  I am making it a tradition to watch this movie every year because it is so cute and has such a good message.  Arthur is the kind of hero that you want to cheer for, and when he triumphs, you feel so proud, and when he falters, you really really want him to get back on his feet.  The humor might be a little big for some of the younger kids, but the quality graphics and general sweetness keep them engaged.  For older \\"kids\\", you will appreciate the humor a lot more.  High quality.  Amazing.  Brilliant.  Fabulous...need more adjectives.  My family's new Christmas Tradition.  I love it that much!
B009JNXK88|3.0|It is a good and fun game. But how can they say its free for today, when its always been free through the Google PlayStore? I think they just mark a price on otherwise free games, just to have a FAOTD.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Book 3 of the Fifty Shades trilogy is awesome. I started reading it immediately after book 2. I'm sad that this is the last book (for now!).. I want to know more of Mr Grey! I recommend reading this book.

B001EC2ISA|5.0|Michael Keaton's performance as a ghoulish exterminator of questionable character is amazing in this offbeat, ( Tim Burton) comedy/horror flick. If you like Tim Burton this is a must-see, early work of his. Great cast, including Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis as the recently deceased ghosts trying to rid their beloved home of the new owners. Jeffrey Jones, Catherine O'Hara and Winona Ryder are wonderful as the quirky new family that have invaded their sanctuary. An unusual and entertaining haunted house film with ghouls, monsters and the ever threatening sand worms?!!!
0143117009|5.0|The book proceeds in a measured and even-handed way. It is by no means a diatribe or one-sided argument that ignores other sides of the story. In the initial example of the Bitterroot Valley in Montana the author shows a willingness to look at all sides of the situation. He has chosen a place in the United States that does not have many prospects for job growth whatever the politics happen to be. It has costly environmental problems due to past practices, particularly concerning the mining industry.<br /><br />My one criticism is that the book could have been more succinct, a little less didactic, but perhaps that is largely unavoidable given the author's stated purpose. A most interesting part of the book concerns those examples from history that show one society as a microcosm, analogous to what planet Earth has become for its inhabitants in this day and age. Questions naturally arise that are pertinent: How was it that the Easter Islanders cut down their last trees? What were the conditions that led the southeastern Polynesians living on three small islands to get to the point of too many people with too little resources?  How could the Anasazi of Chaco Canyon have averted collapse due climate change? What brought about the collapse of the Mayans who at one time numbered in the millions? How was it that the Vikings were so set in their ways and did not take a lesson from the Inuit in the face of climate change?<br /><br />On a personal level, it's not hard to see how development keeps subtracting open space, crowding out those free and unfettered places where one can just innocently take a walk. It also seems evident that the more people that crowd this globe, the fewer freedoms individuals will have. At least if we are to live peacefully, having more and more people means more and more rules. Implicit is the fact that there is a point beyond which crowding causes more contention over the inevitability of scarce resources. Yet, despite limits that keep staring usin the face, the reckless development and the exploding human population show little sign of moderating. The author states that he is cautiously optimistic. But the focus on economic expansion without regard for the future is now so strong that it seems only disasters can create the climate for changing the political will, which is now way too preoccupied with short term benefits.<br /><br />In the section he devotes to modern societies, his four examples include Rwanda, the island of the Dominican Republic and Haiti, China, and Australia. In these examples we can see how environmental problems can have dire consequences. In Rwanda, he makes the point that over population causing contention for scarce resources not ethnic hatred brought on genocide. Despite the political repression in the Dominican Republic, the dictator Balaguer recognized the urgent need to protect the country's forests and took drastic top-down action, differentiating his country from Haiti. China has at least taken some action to control their population. The economy of Australia suffers as a result of bad environmental decisions.
B0012DP8A6|5.0|Love this movie. The staging is great and the  characters well played. Love the way the story is told through the girl singing trio setting up each scene through some really upbeat 60's style R&B tunes. The movie is a mix of comedy and horror. Truly well-done play on the original non-musical B flick of the 60's.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is a very enjoyable film -- the actors are great and the \\"aging boomers\\" are all so different. A little romance, a little comedy and, yes, a little sadness . . . I highly recommend this film!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was well written and kept my attention throughout the story line. At times, the book seemed very predictable. Flynn does a great job developing the characters. I would recommend this book and enjoyed reading it.
B009JNXK88|4.0|This is definately an 8-bit style game. It is graphically pleasing and has good retro music. As the FAOTD it is severely above par. I check out the FAOTD almost every day, but only download a couple a month. I would consider this a decent game for a lot of people even at regular price. The smooth, easy to master controls are a plus.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|As usual Ken Follett has written an amazing story.  His characters give us an insight to the impact of class divisions.  I could not put the book down.
B009IKPOUO|1.0|This is a boring album. I dont care to listen to the talking during production and the music is just plain; nothing catches your attention so you keep skipping to the next track hoping for something better which doesnt come.  \\"Home\\" from the Wiz is BEST when sung by Diana Ross.

B007PFD90G|5.0|Salman Rushdie's third-person memoir is truly riveting. It avoids the boring tedium I have discovered while reading other memoirs (Martin Amis' Experience is truly horrible), and, as should be expected with Mr. Rushdie, it tells a powerful story. Details about his early life are not monotonous, and you really get a feel for where the author came from and how his opinions developed. It may be one of the best memoirs of our day. You will not be disappointed.

B000SO7OMA|5.0|This concert experience is truly the one I treasure more than any other and is one that I rewatch frequently. Loreena McKennitt is my favorite musical artist of all time and this is to date, her only full concert DVD. How fortunate then that \\"Nights from the Alhambra\\" is such an incredible performance. First of all, the setting and the atmosphere place Loreena in a venue that so epitomizes her world music style, the Alhambra palace in Granada, Spain. Loreena is rightly the centerpiece in this majestic venue, and in my opinion her alluring and captivating beauty on this night far surpasses even the visually exhilarating scenery in which she performs. The music itself is somehow more entrancing and ethereal in combination with the visuals. Loreena plays numerous songs from what was her more recent catalog, mostly \\"The Visit\\" through \\"An Ancient Muse\\". Included is the song, \\"Raglan Road\\", which does not appear on any of her albums and is probably the highlight of the show! Loreena vocals are clear and beautiful, and she shows off her versatility on the accordion, harp, and piano. If you are familiar with Loreena McKennitt, then you understand how wonderful her music is. If you are not, then this concert is a perfect starting point because she is every bit as good live as in the studio.

I especially love the way the author not only has you wondering about the two main characters but she also does a great job developing the supporting characters as well.  The book ended giving me just enough to temporarily satisfy me while eagerly wanting to know more.  I cant wait to continue with their developing stories.
B0026145WK|5.0|This is a fun ride and Liam Nelson is absolutely awesome!  If I get kidnapped, I want him to rescue me.
B009329Y30|3.0|When the preview first came out, I really thought this movie would be a dud and it looked like there would be a lack of chemistry between the two main characters.  But my granddaughter told me she thought it was awesome and I should watch it, so I did.  It is really good and has a different way of telling the usual boy meets girl story and the chemistry is great between all the characters.  If you like touching memorable love stories, then you will like this.  This goes a little slow in the beginning but don't give up.

Just means more fun to ddo them again!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Love this character, but in this particular story just too busy trying to tell us that there are bad muslims out there.  I think by now we all know that all the various groups within the muslim religion that don't like us are very real.  He just spent too much time on that and the story got lost.

B00886XQO0|3.0|I hooked these bad boys up and got into some Team Deathmatch on Battlefield 3, and.. Yeah, these perform pretty much the same as any other headset on Battlefield 3 because, the game is so noisy. So, after playing for a couple hours and playing with the settings (even though none of them helped in this game), I decided to switch over to Call of Duty Black Ops and give Hardcore Team Deathmatch a try. And first game in, I went twenty-five and zero on Launch. Mind you, I have not touched a Call of Duty game in months, so this even impressed myself. And I've had other headsets in the past (turtle beach hpx, audio technica ad700 [both powered by the astro mixamp], tritton ax pros), while they have also guided me through the game by sound-whoring --listening for footsteps/reloads/knees crunching-- they were never THIS helpful.<br /><br />For the record, I enjoy playing with my sound settings on \\"loud / surround sound headphones,\\" and I tend to crank my volume to the limits because, my ears are made of some type of freakness. So, I would say that honestly, I could hear the difference in these headsets when compared to my old one(s). Or maybe the fact that I stupidly paid $300 for a pair of headphones had me thinking they gave me \\"superhuman hearing\\"? No idea, and now you're confused as well. Bye.<br /><br />P.S.<br />Truthfully, you are paying for some Black Ops II decals and a headset overloaded with presets you will not use (except one). If I had to suggest an alternative, obviously the $300 rival of this headset would be the Astro A50's. But, my personal favorite setup are the [[ASIN:B000CMS0XU Audio Technica ATH-AD700 Open-air Dynamic Audiophile Headphones]] powered by the Astro Mixamp Pro with the AntLion Mod-Mic attached. But, that's just me.
B003B02O14|3.0|Unlike Grisham's other novels, this one had weaknesses leaving the reader with too many unanswered questions.  The biggest of these questions had to do with a basic premise of the book:  Why did she wait until the end of the story to do what she did?
B009NQKPUW|3.0|i gave this movie a 3 star not because of the beautiful 3d evironments throughout the movie,but for the many,many unanswerd questions that left alot of fans hanging.first off,i am a huge ridley scott fan and as with most people who have seen this movie and have read the many reviews about it,it was obvious that the story left alot of us scratching our heads.ive seen this movie about 5 time already and must have gone through every scene with i fine tooth comb and i have to say this is one of the most mysterious movies ive ever seen by far.let me just give a few examples(although i can give at least 10).(1) when all the scientist went into the cave in the pyramid there were some kind of water/liquid flowing from the roof and on the ground.two of the scientist test there hand gauges and the temperature in the room was -12 degrees(thats very cold).what ever that liquid was it should've been frozen solid not running like  a river in the tropics.unless it was'nt water it could've been some other liquid or somthing.because we all know that water freezes at 32 degrees.(2) what was that metal storm that came out of no where?thats not nothing natural in nature and it appears that as soon as they entered in that room the storm started (i think that storm was a trap set by the engineers for protection).(3) while they were walking in the tunnel we see david use his fingers and picked up a green slime on the wall and smelled it and said\\"impressive\\".what was that green slime?was it the same black goo/infection that infected the engineers?and what was it doing on the wall?i have so many questions to ask about this movie.my conclusion it this,ridley scott tried to make an alien prequal but he purposefully made the movie this way to leave it up to the fans and audience to make our own interpretations instead of just making a movie thats plain and straight to the point.i read that he is in the process of makeing a sequal that will be release in summer 2014.hopefully he will answer some, maybe not all of the many questions we all have about this movie.
B000IDGBWU|5.0|Dirty Dancing is a movie that you can always count on to bring you back to memories of the 80's when it was first introduced. The dancing style was so risque for the time they portrayed, the 60's. Overall a great movie.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I am not a Stephen King reader.  I found this quite interesting, well-researched, did hold my attention and took me on a journey to my own past.  I was excited to see that Mr. King had considered dedicating the book to Jack Finney, one of my favorite author's (Time anad Again) who takes another mature approach to time travel.  This is not a kid's book nor would you find it at Comicon.  It is a good read.

B004EPYZUS|4.0|Mission Impossible-Ghost Protocol(released Dec/11)is a heart thumping adrenaline ride and I think is one of the best of the MI franchise so far.The film never stops from start to finish and the cast is simply brilliant:Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt,the IMF team's leader,Simon Pegg as Benji Dunn, an IMF technical field agent and part of Hunt's team,Jeremy Renner as William Brandt, IMF Secretary's chief analyst and former IMF field agent,Paula Patton as Jane Carter,a member of Hunt's team,Michael Nyqvist as Kurt Hendricks,a Swedish nuclear strategist,Vladimir Mashkov as Anatoly Sidorov, a Russian intelligence operative following Hunt and his team and others.<br />The plot finds Ethan in a Russian prison,while an IMF team outside loses some nuclear warhead codes.The film from here revolves around their recovery of those codes and the identity of the man who wants to put the world on the brink of nuclear war.The team frees Ethan and they start to work on getting the identity of the terrorist out of the Kremlin,no less.The mission goes awry and when Ethan is escaping from the Kremlin a gigantic explosion rips away a good portion of it.However during his escape he spotted the man responsible for the bombing,and who will be looking for those all important codes.<br />The mission has gone sour and Ethan and his team are officially disavowed by their government(Ghost Protocol)and are on their own.Their trail leads them to Dubai,then on to Mumbai,on the trail of the man looking for,getting the codes and trying to reacquire them from him.The team cannot stop the inevitable nuclear warhead launch but Ethan and team do manage to stop the detonation of the warhead on San Francisco,just in the nick of time.The film ends as the team reunites in Seattle,and meets up with Luther(Ving Rhames),who is cleaning up the nuclear warhead mess from the bottom of San Fran Bay.Ghost Protocol has been lifted and the rest of his team agree to go onwards to more missions.<br />This is truly an excellent film from start to finish.Cruise is on top of his game and his supporting cast is also.It's too bad Ving couldn't have been involved in this one,like the previous three,but the rest of the cast more than made up for his absence.Cruise's climb of the building in Dubai is heart stopping,as all he has between him and a death drop are a pair of suction gloves;one of which gives out part way up.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include two deleted scenes and a look at the gadgetry of the movie and the sandstorm sequence.<br />This is a totally cool and high speed romp through yet another MI film and one of the best so far.Cruise and company have this down to an art form now,and if they can maintain the consistent quality they have up to this point,I see and long and successful future for this series.Highly Recommended.4-4 1/2 stars.t film from start to finish.Cruise is on top of his game and his supporting cast is also.It's too bad Ving couldn't have been involved in this one,like the previous three,but the rest of the cast more than made up for his absence.Cruise's climb of the building in Dubai is heart stopping,as all he has between him and a death drop are a pair of suction gloves;one of which gives out part way up.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include two deleted scenes and a look at the gadgetry of the movie and the sandstorm sequence.<br />This is a totally cool and high speed romp through yet another MI film and one of the best so far.Cruise and company have this down to an art form now,and if they can maintain the consistent quality they have up to this point,I see and long and successful future for this series.Highly Recommended.4-4 1/2 stars.
B009NQKXYK|5.0|This was the beginning to all of the old aliens movies.  For an artist to go back to the beginning of an evolution that was trying for mankind was near impossible.  The movie was great with visual needs to satisfy alien fans and the audio was fantastic.  The movie explained so much what created the xenomorph and had a different direction far from fans expected.  Great choices for those actors and actresses picked for the roles they played in Prometheus.

B0013LKFVO|3.0|I tried this in a couple of different flashlights, a regular 2 D cell, a big 6 cell Maglight, and a Rigid, rechargeable battery pack light.  In all of them the light was good, but not great. It certainly wasn't as bright as the regular bulb. I was a bit disappointed and switched back to the regular bulb. I'll probably use this in something I use often, but don't need bright light for, like my dog's flashlight leash.<br /><br />It's nice that the same bulb will work in any flashlight though.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This is one of the best written stories that I have read in a long time (content not punctuation).  It absolutely draws you in from the first page.  I agree wholeheartedly with most of the 5 and 4 star reviews.  Excellent development of the story lines and with the characters.  I was so glad to finally read a story that was not dumbed-down to the 6th to 8th grade reading level that is almost a requirement in the \\"bestsellers\\" of today.  For those reviewers that found it hard to piece things together or found the pace too slow, it is not really your fault, you've grown up with a vast morass of simpleton writing over the last twenty years that requires little thought and imagination.  This book is not one of those.<br />I retired two years ago after a 22 year Marine Corps career.  Because of where the Marine Corps has been for the last two decades I am pretty well read on conflicts in the Middle East throughout much of its history.  I found myself drawing several parallels with our real-life conflict history (all the way from the crusades to present day) with the battles and wars of the book.  In each situation, religion, politics and money are inextricably linked and so few of those involved understand even a fraction. In this book we are given a chance to peak behind the curtain and see the machinations of the 'power brokers' along with seeing the eventual price that those schemes extract on the many.<br />If there is a book two I will buy it in about as much time as it takes Vaelin Al Sorna to dispatch an enemy with a sword.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|To begin, I am a huge Nelson DeMille fan.  His latest book, \\"The Panther\\" is another of his masterpieces.  I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.  I couldn't wait to read it, and then I was sorry it was over so soon.  There is something for everyone in this book.  The action is non-stop and the situations are realistic. I was intrigued with the descriptions of the cities, souks, and people throughout the book.  In every 'fiction' book, there is real truth and knowledge, and this story is full of fascinating history and observations.  The story refers to incidences in past books DeMille has written, but one does not have to have read them to be involved in this one.  If you like the off-beat humor and sarcasm that only Nelson DeMille can write, you will love this book!

So I bought it and am glad I did.<br />This is like Oliver Stone meets Peckinpah meets Scorses with a lot of Pulp Fiction .<br /><br />The story line starts with the Mexican Cartel and I found this very realistic.<br />It moves on to Pot, this too is done very well.<br />Through in a crooked DEA Agent (Travolta) and Benicio as a Cartel honcho and it is a perfect fit.<br /><br />The real story is the two men and O.  One is a Seal, the other did UC Berkeley Business Admin and Botany.<br />If you despise violence stay away.<br />But if you appreciate realism this is the film for you.<br /><br />HARD CORE

B009JNQ86Y|5.0|Another great album by Ellie Goulding.  It took a few plays for me to get used to it, because it definitely has a different sound than \\"Lights.\\"

B000FA5STS|2.0|Baldacci almost struck gold with this one. But..... The narrative starts off at a fast pace. Got my interest going quickly. Then the first surprise came up. Good One! Hadn't thought of that possibility. But then the book keeps going, and going, and going, and going, with plot reversal after plot reversal....to the point that it is difficult to remember how one got to where the book is. This book could have been  shortened by half, or turned into two books. The thing is just too darn long, and never comes to an end.
0316044695|2.0|Ill give it two stars because it really is a good story. But i almost dont want to finish the last 50 pages because it is full of FOX NEWS diatribes. Every other sentence is a bash against liberals. Ive read these types of books before and i understand most of the military likes republicans, im totally fine with that. But i question the accuracy of this story now, it sounds like something written by Fox News as propaganda. Just tell the story and keep it moving, no need to trumpet the GOP.
0316228532|4.0|This isn't Harry Potter.  True enough.  But, Rowling builds a layered picture of family life in small towns.  Politics, drug abuse, sports, bullying, obsessive compulsive disorder, the private lives of parents and teenagers, domestic violence, betrayal, surprising love and morality are all in these covers.  As always, Rowling is a fine story teller.  I live in a small town in America, and I can see her characters around me.  It's not a fantasy and it's not really for children.  Take the book on it's own terms.
B007SUW24W|5.0|Best CD I've bought in a long time, love it!!!<br />Such fun to listen to in the car and sing along!!
B009JNXK88|4.0|I'd give this 3.5 if I could-giving 4 to make up for an undeserved, unfair 1-star I read.<br /><br />This is a fun little game, lots of levels, and charming- though I imagine it will get very repetitive- but most mobile (and many actual 8-bit) games do. It runs great, the look and sound are great; I like it.<br /><br />That said, the controls are a problem. I get the old school aesthetics, but a touch screen makes for a terrible controller, and that's all there is to it. It works, but you'll undoubtedly screw up many times due to accidentally hitting the wrong direction or button, or the home button on your phone, etc. That adds negative frustration to a game already kind of about evoking a different kind of frustration (remember mega man?).<br /><br />Secondly, a less significant issue, the ghosts. They are user-defeatable, yes, but with them turned on you see EVERY attempt, it seems. This gets very confusing, and in a game requiring snap decisions and key timing, that can spell disaster. You can always turn ghosts off altogether, but the feature could still stand to be improved.<br /><br />Add options to select how many ghosts appear on screen (and maybe make them more transparent), and the ability to control the game with user-mapped keyboard presses (allowing for Wiimote/hard keyboard control) and icade style controllers, and I wouldn't have complaints-and I'd definitely play it more. As it stands, I'll keep at it, but I'm not sure for how long.

B0076DCT2G|3.0|John Corey is presented here as the star when we'd like to find out more about Kate Mayfield. Hard for a male author to do, granted, but great authors do a better job of character development in long books. Corey's views are obsessed with Muslim prejudices. We therefore never find out about Mayfield's thinking, unfortunately. Corey is presented here as a one-dimension hero I find hard to believe. This felt like a rush-to-publish job, rather than a great story to savour. Just skip to the action in Part VIII and you have the whole sand box. Peter Fyvie.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|We love this game! Its addicting! Are there new puzzles to look forward to? Can't wait! Keep up good work!
0316228532|1.0|I would NOT have purchased and read all the Harry Potter books if she had written this one first. I managed to get as far as page 53 and took it back to the library. It was boring and the use of foul 4-letter words was offensive. The X on the front of the book is a definite rating.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I'm a long-time DeMIlle fan and look forward to each new release. The story line is good, but the John Corey humor would make it worth while even it it weren't. Definitely male humor, but my wife laughed out loud too. Now I just wait on the sequel.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Very interesing book. It has lots of twist and turns. I never could predict what was going to happen next.The plot was unusaul. I have nver read one like it so it peeked my interest.
0307744434|5.0|My review will be short and sweet encouraging you to read this book. There is nothing a reviewer can say to prepare you for the magical journey you'll take between the covers of The Night Circus - it lives up to all the hype that surrounds it.  It is dreamlike and quickly becomes a book to escape into rather than to simply read.  The home base of The Night Circus is set in Victorian London but the circus itself meanders round the world in its black and white motif; always opening at dusk and closing at dawn.<br /><br />The principal story is of a challenge between a girl and boy but this often becomes secondary as the reader is left to wander the magic and mystery housed in the myriad of tents of Le Cirque des Rêves, the Circus of Dreams.  The boy and girl, Celia and Marco, are bred and charged to carry on the rivalry of their adoptive protectors and instructors but are not known to each other.  They eventually figure out who their adversary is but only after an attraction between them starts to blossom.<br /><br />This is an enchanting tale that is vivid in scope and ethereal at the same time.  It's bound to become a modern day classic in the manner of The Life of Pi.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Prometheus is the reason I gave up watching movies.<br /><br />Short and sweet - the visuals are fantastic, the story line seems original, the editing is ridiculous bad, and the acting is better suited for a B movie.  If there is nothing better on TV or you are a movie honk, this may be a good rental at the going rate; otherwise, wait for RedBox to run it for a buck to ease the disappointment.
B009GN6DT4|5.0|I love E.T. who don't and the digital copy is great for my kids to watch and take with them on the kindle fire. E.T. phone home. :)
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|this game has awesome graphics, upbeat and soothing music and great gameplay. I highly recommend it for all age groups...my 5 year old loves it as do I.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I LOVED this book and quickly devoured the whole trilogy.  The writing was a tad juevenile, but since that was the target audience i didn't mind.  I wasn't expecting to enjoy these books as much as I did.  I don't usually read this genre, and I was pleasantly suprised by the depth of the characters (especially since there are so many).  The concept was bizarre and brutal, but so well done that you could imagine yourself in such a world.  Everything turns out the way you want it to, yet it is not overly predictable.  All in all a great, addictive read!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Horrible life, tremendous outcome! The acts that Jaycee survived are absolutely unspeakable. I admire her courage to share her story with others, so much to be learned by all. A major eyeopener!!
B0066WJLU6|4.0|Nice, simple interface, and I love the fact that it turns on immediately and off when you leave the app. Sharp love the multi-color screen option... great for lighting dark spaces without blinding yourself. Only complaint is how it sends to stutter when changing orientation? Other than that... Great light!
B002BI6SMI|4.0|Taken is an action packed movie and does a great job at keeping you at the edge of your seat.  A classic revenge story with excellent acting by Liam Neeson.
B007QPFGJW|3.0|This was my first read book from this author. I could relate to some of his locations, but otherwise a fairly good writer
B007THA4FI|1.0|I read for entertainment, this book is very depressing. I loved the Harry Potter books but this one is to much like watching the news or reading the paper with the worst kind of news. I didn't finish this book, I couldn't.
B009VB97EY|4.0|The dance numbers are spectacular and the guys are hot. The story is a little weak and there are some boring moments but the dance numbers more then make up for it. All the guys are very talented and are really hot strippers. Highly recommended.

1475143389|4.0|Michael's book is written in clear, simple language.  He explains what to do -- and also what won't work -- to get bigger, leaner and stronger.  I'm excited to try his recommendations and see where they can take me.  Download the free PDF with specific workout plans.  He reached out to me to answer any followup questions I had -- and he got back to me within hours to respond to my questions!

B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Beautiful Disaster by author Jamie McGuire is a contemporary Young Adult Romance set in Eastern University.  Although this is categorised as YA, don't let that deter you. It reads like an Adult Contemporary Romance. Essentially, this is a story of two young adults, who for many years have been trapped in the vortex of life, forced to live in the shadow of their families' expectations and type-casting. Until finding each other, neither believed they could be anyone different.<br /><br />As we meet Abby Abernathy, you see an intelligent, worldly wise, yet immature woman trying to reinvent herself. She's recently moved to Eastern, and on appearances, blends in with the other `cashmere-wearing' Freshmen. Abby, with her dark and infamous history,  feels as though she is finally walking somewhere without the whispers of presumed familiarity of her past. She has left behind chaos, attempting to find order and stability.<br /><br />Travis Maddox - even his name engenders a picture of arrogance, headstrong and `bad boy'. He is the tattoed, `hot' University Hero as well as the undisputed, self-confessed man-whore. Yet, when he meets Abby, he is suddenly relieved by her lack of adoration, and her complete rejection of his single-minded attention. He can see the potential of real friendship and possibly love, something he has never experienced with a girl before.<br /><br />Together, these two are messy or as the title suggests, a `beautiful disaster'.  It is the story of their growing friendship, their struggles with change and acceptance, with many funny situations and heart-felt moments. Travis is intelligent and driven to succeed, and as the story reveals, very devoted and somewhat overbearing. Abby's smart and determined, and with her intelligence and wit, breaks down the barriers that Travis has built in self-protection, allowing him to be `real'. What ensues will occasionally cause you to cringe, but often laugh and sometimes cry.<br /><br />This is not an easy book to read, yet it was extremely hard to put down. Incredibly well written, it is filled with angst, irresponsible teenagers, heart-ache, forgiveness and pain. Simply put, love is not portrayed as cutesy and sweet, but as hard, tough and full of complications and compromise. Perhaps - real?<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster is passionate, gritty, and a very compelling book. On first read, I was annoyed by the see-saw relationship between Abby and Travis, as well as the immaturity of most of the characters. Having said that, on second reading, I loved it. The characters are only teenagers after all, so should be forgiven for being immature and selfish behavior. I look forward to the long-awaited sequel Walking Disaster, a story told in Travis' POV.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Very entertaining, my kids love it. They fight for the phone to play it. Highly recommend for anyone that has kids.
B0083P1QUM|1.0|Could not get 1/4 of the way through this book and I've read all of the prior ones. Too wordy, disjointed and boring. I'm not sure what happened to Patrica Cornwell but I hope she regains her former style because this was extremely disappointing.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this book and can't wait to see the movie!!!!<br />I couldnt put this book down..<br />Read it in 2 days
B003G4W49C|4.0|Very entertaining book, and a quick read. Has much deeper issues at play in the plot, oh and it has a fantastic ending.
1400052181|4.0|The story of HeLa by Rebecca Skloot (The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks) is a very interesting book that combines the personal story of a family with a discussion of the science underlying cell culture. The book describes many of the scientific advances that HeLa was associated with such as developing techniques for transferring cells around the country. In doing so, it highlights the importance of sterility in doing this (explaining how one cell culture can readily contaminate another). HeLa cells were also important for developing the hybridoma technique of fusing different cells, for the initial mapping of chromosomes, for developing the polio vaccine.<br /><br />Some of the things that doctors used to do with patient's tissues were rather shocking before the present day; not only performing experiments on them but also doing various procedures to people without their knowledge. In this context, HeLa cells featured very much in the development of the ideas of privacy and the notions of IRBs and so forth.<br /><br />Overall I felt that the book imparted a lot of useful scientific knowledge and I found it really amazing how this one cell line has made such a huge impact on biological research. Of course I was wondering if these types of studies could be done today -- and, of course, the answer is no.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I've read all three of the book and am very pleased. They keep you wanting to know what's coming next.
B0081BU42O|5.0|A fine continuation of Mr. Banks's Culture series.  I enjoyed this book as much as any of the previous ones and it resembles Excession as much as any of the others IMHO.  I loved Excession as well.<br /><br />If you are not familiar with the Culture, I strongly suggest starting with the other books in order of publication as much as possible.  This will enhance the pleasure of reading this book.<br /><br />Most of the fun to me is the exquisite detail and quality of the prose used to set the scenes and describe the action.  Not a quick commuter read but worth the effort.
B00447L4JG|5.0|This movie is so cute and entertaining.  It also arrived when it was supposed to without any problems.  I would recommend this movie to both adults and older children.
B008FSCNTK|3.0|I love Diana Krall and own everything she has ever recorded.  This disc was a disappointment for me.  The execution was excellent as always, but the selection of songs left me wondering what she was trying to do.  This is not typical of her style and with only a few exceptions most of it was boring.  She even sounded bored by the whole thing.  The whole effort comes across as though she was trying too hard to come out with something new and different.  Since her appeal has always been based on the American Songbook, her audience has an expectation based on her identification with that genre.  This is not that.  I hope it finds new fans for her, but for those of us who have been followers all along, I don't think this set is going to make it.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|This was a good read from Croach. The story held my attention and if you like to read stories that keep you wanting more than I would suggest Pines to you. I did like the story however I didn't expect the radical twist at the end. That made the story not quite as good for me but I will give Crouch another try for sure...
B009CPES4I|4.0|This started out a bit heavy but wound thru lighthearted and cheeky as it introduced compelling characters and delved deeper into their humanity - like Slumdog Millionaire meets Cocoon.  We enjoyed it.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kate Morton does it again...so many wonderful characters.  This one is a page turner-I can't wait to find out what's going to happen with everyone...:)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The third book is still just as good as the one and two.  Keeps you up reading way past bedtime.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|This is just a fun maze of a book to navigate.  On one hand, the ending could seem anti-climatic, but stepping back and looking big-picture, it's nicely appropriate and absolutely true.  Loved the humor throughout as well.
140132634X|5.0|This is my first experience with Mitch Albom's writing and I loved this CD recording of \\"The Time Keeper\\"--a sweet, gentle, thought provoking story.  Very well done and the music at the beginning is so lovely as well.
1476712042|2.0|I didn't dislike this book but I did expect more to happen.  It was predictable and really didn't have much of a direction. I was hoping that their lives would expand and grow but they didn't, at all.
B007EDYN36|3.0|Just finished reading the book and I have to say Peter is one tortured soul. The book, sad to say, is rather dogmatically laced with a \\"woe is me\\" victim mentality throughout. To be fair, Peter is equally disparaging with himself at times, but the vitriol and venom he throws towards his ex-bandmates, ex-wives and business partners is appalling and embarrassing at times because it comes off like a 9 year old emotional child. I mean, you'd think for a guy who is 66 years old - who has been through cancer, two divorces, near suicide, a second chance at fame and fortune would be a changed man for the better. But no, Peter is the victim of bad fortune time and again. It's everyone else's fault he chose to take drugs, cheat on both wives or pay little attention - much less understand how to manage his music career or personal finances. He's down right delusional half of the time! LOL He does say that he's grateful for everything he's got in life, but then turns right around and starts with the tortured \\"poor me\\" routine again and again.  It does get rather tiresome after 300+ pages.<br /><br />In a nutshell, I think \\"Beth\\" is both the single greatest and worst thing to happen to Peter Criss. On the one hand, the song became a huge hit for Kiss, while on the other hand, that same success gave Peter a false sense of reality of himself and his abilities; one that he got swallowed up in. In the end, that destroyed him personally, spiritually and financially. One things for certain, his ex-wives and bandmates are certainly going to hate him after reading this book. At a boy Petey! When you burn the bridge, man, you burn it all the way down to the pulp! LOL<br /><br />Don't get me wrong here, I am a fan of the original KISS, and when it all comes down to it, I DO think each of the original four members brought something very unique to the table. I mean, there was definitely a time when Peter could actually play his instrument well. Kiss Alive! is a perfect example of Peter at his best, before fame, drugs and womanizing and crashing cars took over!<br /><br />If I could ask Peter anything after reading his book, it would be...<br />Well man, how 'bout it? Is it everyone else's fault you screwed up your life? Or is it your own inablility to face reality and take responsibility for your poor choices?<br /><br />A decent read, but I could've done without some of the very personal stories regarding his ex-wives and their performances in the bedroom! TOO MUCH INFO at times! lol I applaud PETER for his honesty, but damn, he opened his entire brain for the world to pick apart here! He made need a frontal labotomy after this is all finished. LOL
0786962984|5.0|This remake is based off the late 70's early 80's Dungeon board game which I feel had the best dungeon layout (maze) and creatures\treasures. They also improved it by placing various helpful charts on the board itself and made things a lot easier and less of an effort to do (such as keeping track of unbeaten creatures).<br /><br />This is basically a game of getting loot and making it out of the Dungeon with enough of it to win the game (before the other players do). Your hero enters a room, fights a monster and if your hero wins you get a treasure. When you have enough treasure to win the game you must head back to the entrance and make it there alive. .<br /><br />This is a great fundamental introductory to Dungeons & Dragons for kids.<br /><br />It teaches two things. Strategy and basic math. If you have kids (girls and boys), they will all have fun playing it. (Its not just a boys game). Pictures on the pawns depict female elves, wizards etc and my daughter loves it.<br />The pictures for the monsters are well done too. Snakes, Spiders, Orcs, Werewolves, Dragons....<br /><br />There is also optional solo rules for single player gaming.<br /><br />Other reviewers complain about the cheap quality but I didn't really think so. Based on certain other products maybe so but I simply didn't see it. Our cat chewed on a player pawn and nothing happened to it! The board is solid and folds out and all the cards and artwork are top rate.<br /><br />Highly recommend this game and its very well done.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|A Post-apocalyptic wasteland. Check.<br />Remnant of humanity oppressed and ignorant. Check.<br />Huge government conspiracy. Double check!<br />This collection of stories, while solid science fiction, reads a lot like a mystery/political thriller.  With details told through flashbacks revealing secrecy and conspiracy, I have to describe this story as LOST meets The Fallout Video Game series.  Hugh Howey is my new favorite author, how this guy isn't everywhere is beyond me!

B001NLKT60|5.0|Usually, sequels are half as good as the original. This sequel is at least as good, and moves even faster because we know many of the characters. Excellent read. Now I am on to the third book!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I kept waiting for her to get her come-uppense. So I very disappointed with the ending. I did not finish the book with a good feeling. I wish I had read it hard copy instead on my Kindle, I'd throw the book away.
B009NQKXYK|5.0|Another great one by Ridley Scott. This keeps you guessing and portrays the ultimate sacrifice when going where humans were not meant to be.
B009JNXK88|4.0|Well worth the money they are asking. The other reviews are accurate in comparing it to the other games. It ran great on my  fascinate. Great pixel art and the game flows well. Good mix of timed (stars) and completion objectives. (stars)
B007FEZQF8|5.0|This is a great series. I highly recommend it to anyone who love apocalypse style comics and definitely to anyone who loves the series.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|This is a great product that works as advertised.  I was able to move files without any problems between my Kindle and PC so that I could upload them to my Android phone.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|It was not Alien, but the comparisons are probably unfair. As a film in it's own right it was ok, but not one that stuck with me afterwards. That's my main \\"test\\" for whether a movie is special to me. It can have all the great acting and all the great effects in the world, but if it's not still on my mind the next day, it's a three star at best.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|One of the best Scarpetta books yet!  Couldn't put it down.....Read it in its entirety on a road trip! Fabulous....already waiting for the next one!
B005721W9O|5.0|Great movie. High profile cast and great dialogue! Alan Rickman, Sigourney Weaver and Tony Shalhoub at the top of their comedic game.  Hysterical and worthy of unlimited viewings. Don't miss owning this classic!
B007MFLFMI|5.0|I bought this because it was a big Depeche Mode fan many years ago and have been on an electronic instrumental kick lately - listening to a lot of Solvent and Lowfish. I listened to the previews of the songs on Amazon.com and just loved the sound of it so I bought it and can't stop listening. Not a lyric on the entire disk - not that I hate lyrics - but if you don't like instrumentals this probably isn't for you. I love listening to this while power walking - nice consistent, rapid beat.

B007THA4FI|1.0|Rowling's attempt at writing for adults was incredibly disappointing.  Repetitive, boring.  I expected more.  I won't be purchasing any future novels.
0525953728|3.0|Nice read about how Seal Team 6 gets chosen, how they train, and some of the missions they go on. Nice info on the type of gear and stuff they use. Details are limited as expected and although camadarie and team work rule their decisions, these guys seem to live solitary lives when they are not on a mission. The story on the raid to get Bin Laden was pretty much the same as shown on 60 Minutes. No drama once the chopper rotated down and was saved. Nice hearing he took one in the head after all the pain he caused.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Hi have now read 4 of 5 of the Game of Thrones series and love it!  Great character descriptions and since it takes place over many years a lot of wonderful character development too.  I don't have HBO but look forward to buying or renting the DVDs of this series.
0679746048|5.0|Sharp. That is the best word I can use to describe this book.<br /><br />Before I go on, KINDLE EDITION PLEASE! It takes a month for books to reach my doorstep. That seems like a lifetime after the instantaneous gratification of ebook delivery.<br /><br />I saw the movie before I read this book, and this is one of those rare instances where both the movie and the book are equally good. So even if you've already watched the movie, give this book a go- you'll be glad you did.<br /><br />This book is written in more of a freestyle fashion, where the writer's voice is strong and events don't necessarily happen in chronological order. But Kaysen is so dry in her dark shade of humour, and events are told in such crisp detail that I enjoyed every page. My only complaint is that this thin, large print book was finished in just two short sittings. I could have stayed with Kaysen for a lot longer.<br /><br />\\"Girl, Interrupted\\" succeeded in all the ways that Sylvia Plath's \\"The Bell Jar\\" failed.

B005EWDA9M|1.0|One would think that a book this popular would at least be passable. But right from page one, this book is flaw after flaw. If you want to do yourself a favour, check out the numerous one-star reviews posted on 1Q84's other listing: [[ASIN:0345802934 1Q84: 3 Volume Boxed Set (Vintage International)]]<br /><br />This book is full of boring and repetitive introspection. We are repeatedly bombarded with minute (but superficial) character details. Everything from the character's appearance to their mental prowess. And just in case we miss this mind-numbing deviation from decent story-telling the first time around, Murakami repeats the formula on almost every page. 1Q84 read like the unpublished slop of millions of budding teen writers worldwide. Eager to share everything that's unimportant, breaking every \\"writer's rule of thumb\\", while simultaneously skimming on any semblance of an interesting plot.<br /><br />Needless to say, I didn't even finish book one. And at $10, this is the first time I'm asking Amazon for a refund.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|If you were a teenager in the 80's and 90's then this is a movie for you. We watched, we sang, we danced, it is awesome. All the Actors sing with their real voices and Tom Cruise knocks it out of the park as Stacy Jacks! Some of the songs they sing sound better than the originals!! Loved Loved Loved this movie!! I even bought the soundtrack too!!

0345803485|2.0|Really too many \\"Holy shits\\" and other non-holy staff there... Chapters... oh really chapters? Did this book had a structure? What's the point in chapters like this?<br /><br />Characters are too unrealistic... I will agree with other reviews... a teenager could think of the character of the Grey... The character of the Ana is also unbelievably weak...<br /><br />But I should say that I read till the end wondering how she should finish the story... thus two stars, because I could read and finish the book.<br /><br />But is this really a bestseller? I had better views on the readers... or how much does it cost to list a book as bestseller?<br /><br />With my busyness buying a bestseller is a way to save time on reading the reviews and researching before... now I'm lost...

B0083P1QUM|5.0|I like the Kay Scarpetta books; I like her character.  She is strong, competent, and human.  I didn't want to put the book down and found myself reading late into the night to uncover the latest development.  The plot is intriguing and although there are several doors opened as to possible villains, I never even considered the who who turned out to be evil.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This series is a must read! The Mark of Athena was even better than the last book! I was unaware that there were 2 more books being written for the series, so I thought this was the end. It was a better sweet moment. Because i love his books, but I thought I wouldnt have to wait for anymore. Oh well, just have to wait for another 360 days for the next book! Hope you enjoy.
B008K5T5AI|4.0|I'm not sure this is Banks best, but nevertheless held me enthralled for two weeks.  I do love a good long read. However, warning, you have to have high levels of concentration for this one.  I found I could only really read a chapter at a time, then let it float in my awareness, then often as not going back to re-read sections. Definitely looking forward to his next Culture tome.

B00688628M|5.0|Band of Brothers is one of the best mini-series ever made! It's the story of Easy Company from the Army's 101st Airborne Division and their battles across Europe during WWII. Damian Lewis is fantastic as Lt. Winters who leads Easy Company against the Nazis. Donnie Walhberg and Ron Livingston also do a great job in their supporting roles.<br /><br />I love the individual stories of the soldiers and especially the interviews with the actual vets for each episode. Band of Brothers was produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks and has the quality of \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" but with 10 mini-movies.
0316228532|3.0|The Casual Vacancy was a very difficult book to read. I say that based on  storyline, not the actual writing. Ms. Rowling has a beautiful writing style and can tell amazing stories. However, in her first book written specifically for adults, she tells a very depressing tale of a town at war with itself.<br /><br />As I starting reading this book, I was really confused by all the character introductions. There are a lot of characters in the this book and it is difficult to keep everyone straight. I was about halfway through the book before I obtained a full grasp on all the characters.<br /><br />There aren't many appealing characters in this book. When you think you like someone, he/she will do something horrible; not a lot of redeeming qualities in the town of Pagford. However, Ms. Rowling was able to capture the small-mindedness of a small community. Judgment and prejudice runs rampant throughout Pagford. You feel the animosity felt by all.<br /><br />The hero of the book is the deceased Barry Fairbrother. After his death, he is practically sainted by most in Pagford. His friends want to continue his dream, whether they believe in it or not, and his enemies want to destroy it. This ongoing battle brings out the worst qualities that Barry would have hated.<br /><br />It is so sad on how badly the children are treated. The abuse is very difficult to stomach. The truly innocent do indeed suffer the most.<br /><br />Be prepared that this is a very depressing and sad book. There really isn't anything uplifting in the end. I'm not even sure that any of the characters learned any lessons. They will keep wallowing in their own judgment and misery.<br /><br />In the end, I found this book really difficult and depressing. I won't say that I was disappointed. It was beautifully written but I just didn't appreciate Ms. Rowling's choice of storyline.

B004SJ3BCI|3.0|This seems a little sensitive. Trying to adjust the distance isn't that easy.  One of the levels seems impossible to get through. You should be able to adjust the length that you can pull the birds to get more force.
B004SMDJ9U|4.0|Well, let me first get started by saying this show is a great show. It has the mysteries that leave you guessing till the end, but still has that soft touch that makes you feel warm on the inside. Why I didn't give this show 5 starts was because in a'lot of the episodes it got very cheesy, and it just turned me off to the show. Except, I do recommend it for the people that love mystery.

B0087ITC56|5.0|Moments make heroes not lifetimes, and Denzel Washington's performance of Whip Whitaker in \\"Flight\\" proves that. While Whip may be a great pilot he's a human being with a lot of problems that take up as much room in his life as his heroism.<br /><br />Washington's Whitaker is a pilot who we seem from the outset has a lot of problems in his life, an ex-wife, a drinking problem, and a bit of cocaine habit which all might not be so bad if he weren't an airline pilot about to board a flight he's piloting.<br /><br />The flight starts off rocky, Whitaker takes off through a rainstorm and powers through it to clear air, with a bit of lying to the control tower about what he's doing, the rest of the flight is uneventful until the plane starts to malfunction and to save the plane he flies it inverted before flip it back and landing in a field with only minimal deaths onboard. The rest of the movie deals with how Whitaker deals with his problems and his addictions as its discovered that he was drunk at the time of the crash and the NTSB hearing looms ever closer and jail time is the outcome if he's found negligent.<br /><br />Washington has one of his best performances in \\"Flight\\" it's a low key and understated performance and most of it is realized in Whitakers attitude as he moves through the ordeal from a confident and cocky pilot, to a man worried about his future and he tries to influence the testimony of the crew on the airplane, Margaret (Tamara Tunie) and his co-pilot (Brian Gerahty). John Goodman puts in a flamboyant performance as Whitaker's on-call drug dealer and he almost steals the show with a performance that should be over the top but isn't. Kelly Reilly has a great role as Nicole, a heroin addict who moves in with Whitaker but can't take his addictions and denial.<br /><br />The songs played on the soundtrack are kind of an obvious telegraphing what's going on, but one intriguing aspect was the heartbeat played at appropriate moments.<br /><br />\\"Flight\\" is the kind of movie made to highlight good performances, everything from the special effects to the acting to serves to make a poignant and powerful film.the kind of movie made to highlight good performances, everything from the special effects to the acting to serves to make a poignant and powerful film.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|This was a good read for the story. A little redundant at times but a great story about a true American hero. Not as detailed as I would like but good none the less. This review is in no way a reflection on Chris. He is a hard core operator with nothing to prove. Wish his writer support had been a little more spot on. A great guy and a great Texan. Thanks for everything Chris!
1401223176|5.0|First off, I absolutely love the art. Jim Lee is one of my favorite artists and he portrays Batman with just the right amount of darkness and flair. The storyline is also amazing. The plot twists and turns as you, like Batman, try to figure out the answer to the riddle. What has gone wrong and who is the man behind the bandages? I'm a big Batman and comic book fan in general. Hush might be my all-time favorite. You won't regret this purchase.
B002H3T3TM|2.0|This s a great DVD to get to know Michael...the man...the employer...his climb to fame through his own words, NOT a concert at Madison Square Garden! A song here, a song there all interrupted by interviews, playing ping pong, horsing around with his crew, etc. I know that I could have read more about this DVD before I  bought it, but when a DVD is called \\"Michael B. meets Madison Square Garden\\", well, I expected Michael singing at Madison SG, not just talking about it. Good documentary, very informative but unfortunately I can't watch it more than once.
B001BKVWYQ|5.0|If word of mouth is anything to go by on good music, Then Rodriguez's debut album 'Coldfact' would be top of the charts!<br />Everytime I have this album playing in public, I always have someone say to me, \\"who's this? It's really good, I really like it\\" etc etc<br />Once I proceed to tell them the unbelievable story that is Rodriguez, They are hooked and heading out to buy the album and tell all their friends about him.<br />There is something romantic about story of Rodriguez, his American obscurity, his SA and Australian notoriety, his reluctant fame and humble self! At the heart of his story is this album called Coldfact. It's an album that takes you on a journey unlike most albums of the last 40 years. I true treasure in anyones record collection that takes the time to simply listen.<br />It makes me glad to see he is finally getting recognition for this masterpiece all these years on!
B003XYERRM|5.0|Since Sept. of this year I read every one of Sharon Penman's books. Am on my last (sadly) the Sunne in Splendour. She is in the process of finishing her last book on Richard (The Lionheart) but won't be available for another year, maybe two!! I have been living in the 11th century these past months although this last book is 14th century. She is an amazing writer. I have loved every minute of my reading and hated for them to end. You are \\"there\\" amidst these individuals, their experiences, their wars, intrigue, betrayal, birth, death. Anyone interested in this period of history will not be disappointed. She spends a great deal of time on her research and well worth it!
B0012CCNUU|4.0|Don't forget about the Wilburys! Catchy, unique tuneage all the way through. Isn't that all you usually want from your music?
B000JMKTLO|4.0|A gripping, dark read that makes you feel guilty for wanting to read more. Just when you think you know where it is going, it takes a sharp turn.. A book that is hard to read but even harder to put down. You will find yourself drawn into the deep complexities of family drama.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Dark Shadows plus Johnny Depp--what more could I ask?  I have all the DVD's of the original TV version of Dark Shadows and have loved it for many years.  I watched the originals when I was a young mother--yes, I'm that old.  When I saw that Tim Burton was reviving my favorite stories, starring Johnny Depp, I couldn't wait to see it.  I was not disappointed.  The movie stayed quite true to the original, with just enough camp to make it fun to watch. Casting was perfect, and to see Jonathan Frid make an appearance was the crowning jewel. I highly recommend this DVD, especially for anyone old enough to remember the original Dark Shadows.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I really like the game, there is a lot to do, and really makes you think.  I am playing on my Kindle Fire, and find it a little hard to see, since my eyes aren't as good as they used to be.  I still play and I do enjoy the game.  If you like hidden object games, this is one you should try.
B000W15B24|5.0|This is the best album I've heard in quite some time, possibly ever.  There is something about listening to Johnny that makes everything feel warm and fuzzy. There is not one bad track on this recording.  A few stand outs are the title track, I hung my head, In my Life (a beatles cover), So lonesome I could cry and the streets of laredo(<---my favorite track).  My wife is getting sick of hearing this album, but in her defense, I haven't really stopped listening to it in the past 3 weeks or so.  If you are new to Johnny this is a great place to start, if you are a long time fan I can't imagine that it would disappoint either.  LONG LIVE JOHNNY!
B009RIMPIG|5.0|Our Dynamic Duo go to Castle's home in the Hamptons, their relaxing weekend is interrupted by Murder. Our DD help the local police solve the case and have spare time to investigate each other.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Not one of her best. Story was not that interesting and I wasn't on the edge of my seat trying to figure out who done it. There really was not an unraveling of clues for you to figure out. Ending was not that exciting. I usually finish a good book in 3 - 5 days. It took me 3 weeks to finish it and this was in the mist of the storm when I was at home alot. Not sure what is happening to Cornwell, maybe this list of characters have run out of good story lines. Perhaps she needs to start a new series with different characters.
B000FCK65W|5.0|An old classic, beautiful writing. She puts you right into that world in the first paragraph. You are deeply involved with an 11year old girl growing up in a very poor existence with lots of love to help her grow.
B007EECSFA|3.0|The characters never seemed quite developed. Not one of my favorite reads.  I have really enjoyed Kate Morton's other books and was disappointed in this one...
B008F5YDRI|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at the pace and humor of this movie. I expected \\"heartwarming\\" and \\"sweet,\\" but I didn't expect to laugh out loud! Also, I was willing to endure what I thought would be a slowly-paced movie because I was curious about the story. However, I was delighted to move through the story line with continued interest - due to a wonderful cast, a clever script, and great camera work and editing - and will definitely come back to this film for repeat viewing.
B00846REIS|4.0|This book kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time! I was a little disappointed on the way it ended but am looking forward to the next one!
B000JBWWRY|5.0|This Disney Classic, out of print, like many Disney Classic dvd reissues, was very reasonably priced. It arrived expeditiously in near mint condition. I would give this item and the vendor 5 stars.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I really liked the amount of \\"spice\\" she includes in her writings.  She doesn't over do it, but doesn't skimp, either!  I can't wait for the next book in the series!
B00846REIS|2.0|It totally felt like \\"50 Shades\\" copy!!.. I mean just certain parts sounded just like \\"50\\".... It was alright but ill just stick with \\"50\\"...
1451696191|3.0|I bought the book and then went to see the movie in theaters. The book was an easy read and kept me well engaged. However, I found the content to be depressing. One thing after another, each and every one of Charlie's letters has something disturbing and depressing about it... suicide, homosexuality, bullying, abuse, abortion... it's all in there. The movie wasn't much better, but isn't that generally the case that the book happens to be better. There were a few very moving moments in the movie, but overall, just another cheesy hollywood adaptation.
030758836X|4.0|I wish there was a way for me to reach inside myself and paste onto this post the actual emotions I felt while reading this book. There is no doubt in my mind that this is one of the most thrilling books I have read all year. This review will be solely my feelings on this book, to write any type of synopsis-based review will have me spoiling the whole thing, guaranteed.<br /><br />I first heard about Gillian Flynn through ChapterStackss on Youtube, and was instantly intrigued by her admiration for the author and her work-I had to pick one of her books up. I had decided to read them in chronological order, but ended up getting my hands on Gone Girl first.<br /><br />Best.move.ever.<br />Not that I'm doubting the greatness of her other works, I'm just ridiculously happy that I decided to read something by her, period. This book was outstanding, and written with tremendous thought and detail. I was in pieces with awe after each new development unfolded. This book had me speaking out loud the entire time-I kept saying \\"HA! How is she going to explain THAT one!\\"..and then she did, perfectly. I'll admit it: I tried, and failed miserably, to find holes in the plot, I really did-but Ms.Flynn had her detail down to an art, an absolute art.<br /><br />And those characters..my goodness. They were the type of characters that you just knew you should despise, loathe, want to condemn. But she knew it, Gillian knew we would do no such thing. The cleverness and the wit of them. The naivety and pathetic charm. I was instantly hooked, and I didn't want it to end.<br /><br />The conclusion of this book was the real mind blaster. I felt like I was reading the last few chapters while submerged underwater. I didn't want to believe what was happening, but it was happening, and I could either accept it for what it was, or give this book a horrible rating for it. I chose the former, for the simple reason that it was genius. Pure, horrible, insane, wonderful, intellectual, psychological..genius. I sat there, and once again spoke out loud to myself. This time with..\\"What..did I just read?..<br /><br />I don't know if I can pick up Gillian's other 2 books fast enough. But I must, and I will. Bravo..just..BRAVO Gillian Flynn.ius. I sat there, and once again spoke out loud to myself. This time with..\\"What..did I just read?..<br /><br />I don't know if I can pick up Gillian's other 2 books fast enough. But I must, and I will. Bravo..just..BRAVO Gillian Flynn.
B009NQKXYK|2.0|good movie but the HD was kinda choppy.. digitized a lil across the screen a few times. I liked the movie but was a little disappointed that the HD version had the digital problems...
B0076DCT2G|5.0|The wait was worth it.  DeMille has once again combined a topically relavent story and one of the funniest characters in all of modern literature into a masterful and engaging book.  John Corey is so funny that my wife has forbidden me to read in bed while she tries to sleep.  If half of what DeMille describes the CIA operative to be like, our nation is in a lot of trouble.  I am eagerly awaiting DeMille's next novel!
B008HK3XKO|5.0|This is the best case possible for the Kindle. It's slim, easy to use, and protects the tablet.  It also can sit up without sliding down.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Better to spend a few extra dollars on this than get a cheap one that doesn't work; I would know, I had to send my first case back and then got this one.
B001RIY4WE|1.0|!!!WARNING!!!<br /><br />The copy of the movie on this \\"Skynet\\" blu-ray is NOT in high definition!<br /><br />It looks like what they've put on to this Blu-ray is the lower resolution DVD scan of the movie. It's obviously not the HD version. There's no HD-level detail in the faces, or the costumes, or anything else.<br /><br />The menus are definitely in HD. But don't be fooled, the movie itself is not.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I absolutely loved this game it is so addicting I recommend this game to all ages! I play this 24/7!
B009SJ46EA|3.0|Last season was so much better. The show still has me though, I cant get enough of Jessica Lange. But I wish the show did more of what they did last year. Last year you never knew who was alive and who was dead. This year, not so much, its been like a B teen horror flick.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book! Written for the young adult so it's an easy read. You won't want to put it down. Already bought the next book in the series.
B0081L391C|4.0|A little predictable and raunchy, but nothing too graphic or over the top for this genre. Second half slowed down a bit, but entertaining.
B0038P59A0|5.0|But not as good as the second film. Still, it was a very entertaining film and I enjoyed it. Appropriate for older kids, too.
B0042C1BP0|4.0|Enjoyed it. A little long and the plot was pretty complex for a Bond movie, but all in all a good film.
030758836X|1.0|Felt completely ripped off! I could not believe the book ended the way it did! It felt like the author just gave up or hit a literary wall. Completely disgusted!
B007V65R54|5.0|For those who read polls or any statistical explanation, some background in statistics is important.  This book is a good primer for those with little or no background.  It keeps it interesting by having stories relating it to sports, poker, weather and politics.  A good read and both informative and sometimes fun (which usually is not the case for anything related to statistics!)
B009NQKPUW|5.0|This movie is science fiction at its finest with lofty ideas and impressive vistas throughout. Ridley Scott's distinctive visuals shine through but also so does his open ended scenes...which can leave you wanting more scene and/or character development but overall this film is a great addition to any sci-fi lovers collection as the image and sound quality of the Blu-ray delivers.
B0083GOPSG|3.0|I had high hopes for Chronicle.  I think a lot of people did.  The premise is great and something most of us wish we could do, have super powers.  The movie hits a few rough spots in the story, some not so smooth story elements, but overall it's an action movie, between guys with super powers, so it's definitely worth watching...once.
0316067598|5.0|Read this book before leaving to Afghanistan. Great Book!!! If you're looking for a book about real military training, action, pride, honor, and sacrifice; this is your book. I will never forget Marcus Luttrell and his fellow Seals.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Good Read but it is a soap opera, never going anywhere. Martin writes well, I enjoy the story's BUT, I think he studied under Robert Jordan. Lets see how long I can make this story. I think I am going to skip book 5 at $15 (on kindle) and wait until it gets under $9.  It will be years before the story ends anyway.
B008ASLNN2|4.0|Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law are great in their second Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows.  I hope they keep making these movies.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|After watching the first series, I am excited to watch series 2.  The acting is superb!  I love that some of the same actors from the first series are in this series 2.  Never expected a totally different story line.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I started with the free sample of the book...which is just the first chapter. I instantly bought the book and was done with it in less than 48 hours! It's a delight to read! Entertaining, sensual, it's got it all! Intrigue, action, and lots and lots of \\"action\\". A really good read which will just make you want to buy the second book as soon as you're done with it. I've read the whole trilogy...and as soon as I finished it, I started reading it all over again! It just doesn't get old! Simply excellent!
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Loved it.  Was in suspense the entire time, right up to the end.  This was my second time reading the series as I was preparing to read Iced.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|It's pretty cool. It does what it is supposed to do. It is simple and easy to use. Good app.
B009OYTOA0|5.0|Found Arrow to be a wonderful adventure with  a amazing hero.  the action is exciting and the stunts amazing.  I would recommend this series to anyone who likes comic heros.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|It does exactly as stated.  I enjoy the fact that I can save links and articles as an option.  The fact that its free is even better!  You will be using it alot.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|Story was decently developed; however, I like my romance stories more grown up.<br /><br />This would be suitable for a mature teen....disappointing for a grown woman.
B00992CF6W|5.0|great app it is worth the money easy i suggest getting pocketinveditor so you can make lava water, spawn mobs etc. i hope you find this helpful
B000P0J0EW|5.0|Great movie, great quality. Just look at the number of reviews and the rating this movie has from over 1000 reviews.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|it was a great game but then they want you to buy thirty more levels, it should not be called free in my opinion.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I love this author and have read everything he's written.  I waited and waited for this to come out so that I would have something new from him to read.  Finally!  And it was so wonderful to read about John Corey again and what a treat to get Paul Brenner as well. Both such excellent characters.  I only didn't give it a fifth star because I thought there was a little much of the descriptions and  back ground, most of which I truly enjoy but as a avid DeMille reader a lot of it was recap for me and I wanted it to move faster.<br /><br />VERY EXCELLENT BOOK.  I don't know how I going to be able to wait for his next.  Hurry up Nelson!!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|The product came in a short amount of time. It contained no scratches and works perfectly! Very pleased. The dvd was in great condition and I have watched it many times.
B006R1T40I|5.0|Love this CD - lyrics rock!  Bonnie Raitt pulls no punches, addressing the ups and downs of loving, losing and coping.
B008BO61BE|5.0|Awsome album.Redone very nice. The dvd is great. This is one of the best heavy metal albums ever made. They are not called the Metal Gods for nothing.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|The shipping was really fast! I live in Europe and I pre-ordered 5 RED CDs on the US Amazon site. It says I should be getting this in more than a month but it only took 2 weeks (exactly 14 days).<br /><br />The packaging was okay. 3 CD boxes was a little bit broken on the side but you don't see it unless you really want to.<br /><br />Yes, and the songs are incREDible!! I think there are some songs with the style from Fearless. A must-have for all Swifties!!
B009NQKXYK|3.0|The movie had alot of action, but was hard to follow, especially towards the end. The streaming in HD was very good.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|This book gave me new insight into my youth and present life.  I also felt validated and vindicated by the anecdotes and study results. Thank you for your quiet strength and insight.
B003N0XDT4|5.0|My laptop suffers from heavy interference noises on its standard jack output, this product just solved this.<br /><br />It outputs a really good quality sound on my ath-m50.<br /><br />It works perfectly under linux.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Better than the movie! Best book ever (: I want to buy the paperback to have in my collection! Yaa
B002PNF8HK|3.0|This is a off the wall horror movie. Great for the Halloween weekend. See it before you see the original.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is very entertaining, and frankly I couldn't ask for more from a free app.  Gold is a little hard to come by in the game, but I do not feel like it takes any enjoyment out of playing Dragon Story.  You just need to find people who gift and request them.  I highly recommend this app.
B007L24T52|5.0|As always Baldacci shows his best! You will not be able to leave the book until you've read the last word!
B005HT400A|2.0|im not even going to that place. girlfriend. that's a....... who was that ear why was it cut off. why is that woman there. what was the point of this. just see isabella naked? don't know where palmer. bob has a tattoo for you laura
B009G3T01M|5.0|Great album. Macklemore has lots to say that is worth hearing.  Ryan Lewis makes it so much fun to listen to.
B005FC49MS|2.0|I remember seeing this one in a cinema back in the day with me homies. Good times. After the film was over, drivebys. Good times.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|I loved the movie. I was unable to view the bood I purchased online on my Kindle Fire. I have called seven times since August 24, 2012, The reps I talked to all seemed competent, but when I did what they recommended nothing happened. I had over $125.00 worth of books on my kindle. They are all gone. At this point the only thing my kindle is good for is as a paperweight. I would love some assistance in this matter but I doubt I will get it.
B0086A40AW|2.0|i did watch this. i did watch this. i saw it as a time line running backward to the beggining of the end. try gaining that for the big bang.
B009IKPOUO|5.0|There is no one like her.  She is the female voice to which I compare all others, and most others just come up short!  Granted, most, if not all, of the music featured here was recorded earlier and over a great number of years; but it's so good to hear her treatments of Broadway standards and other selections she decided to sing though not include on previous albums.  I defy you to not feel the hairs on the back of your neck rise when she sings the medley from \\"Finian's Rainbow.\\"  And \\"I Think It's Going To Rain Today\\" is so simple and lovely.  And best yet?  Amazon's price for download the day of release!  If you're a fan of Barbra's (and isn't it unAmerican to not be?), this album of songs will be a great addition to your playlist.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Loved this book!  The last two books were just mediocre but this one kept me turning pages like the Grisham of old!<br />You could tell he was having fun writing this book!
B006QNDDHW|4.0|I purchased this book on a recommendation of a PowerPoint guru. What's most helpful from this book is the design tips including color, layout and flow. I'm a pretty good PPT builder already, this just helped fill in some shortcomings in my graphic design toolbox.<br /><br />I will be a better designer for having this reference.<br /><br />On a side note I purchased the Kindle version first. I returned it because it was not really a Kindle text-based book. It was a collection of page snapshots. Even the Table Of Contents was an image and didn't include links to the chapters. I returned it the same day and purchased the hard copy. Figured if I was going to have to look at pictures, it's better on paper pages than a kindle screen.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have just started using Pinterest and downloaded the app shortly after.  I love having the mobile app.  I was able to look up a recipe I had pinned when I was at the store after I forgot my list.  It's also great to have to look through when you are stuck somewhere and have a few extra minutes of wait time.
B004HD61KE|5.0|This was the most enjoyable reading that i've had in recent days. i enjoy the Sigma Force novels better than the James Bond or Harry Potter novels.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Keeps you laughing and anxious at the same time. Very pertinent in today's world. Wanted to read all day. He is the best!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Really loved every single thing about this book and cannot wait to read more. Please keep writing more and more:))!!!
B007IXWKUK|1.0|The book has the ability to be a good read, but I didn't care for the illicit sex scenes....I would end up paging through the paragraphs of the bondage sex (which was more than half of the book) until the story began again.  If I buy a book, I would like the opportunity to read the entire book instead of being bored with some fantasy of how men need to control women to be successful, good looking and oh yea, loving and caring?  I didn't even finish reading the second book, shame on me for taking a chance and buying the second book with hopes the sex scenes would be diminished and the mystery thread in the books would take precedence.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|A really excellent second book and the plot keeps getting better and better! Cannot wait to read the next book and the next and the next:))
B004I744AS|2.0|when I got the update on it it didn't tell u how to pronounce it, it just shows definition .
B005I548B4|4.0|Super, un vrai Nicholas Sparks, a la fois romantique et dramatique, fait réfléchir et ressentir !un vrai plaisir, donne envie d'en lire d'autres.
B008FSCNTK|1.0|I have loved Diana Krall's work for many years and have always enjoyed her forays into new and different realms.  I looked forward eagerly to this album, but it is a heartbreaking disappointment.  Not even the arousing pulchritude of the photos on the cover and in the insert can compensate for the unfortunate noises contained here.  The arrangements are terrible, trashy honky-tonk, creepy almost-country, and dragging, lugubriously percussive dirges.  The overwhelming presence of guitar, twanging and plinking, eviscerates Ms. Krall's uncharacteristically thin and weak piano.  Her voice, which usually takes flight with vitality and playfulness, seems weighed down with the attempt to find some sort of profundity in songs that are redundant and trivial.  All artists are entitled, even obligated, to experiment and to stretch themselves outside of their comfort zones, but this particular experiment is a failure.  I hope Ms. Krall will return to the fertile fields she has cultivated so marvellously in the past.  Please, no more sad ghosts from a rundown turn-of-the- (19th) century bordello.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Excellent read.. I agree with others that perhaps,the ideas may stem from another novel.. however, in saying that this is a very good bookt and I am looking forward to reading the 3rd and final installment...
B009JNXK88|4.0|This title reminds me a lot of Mega Man from the NES days. I was kind interested in this title. Being TFAOTD is a nice change of pace based on what's be offered as of late.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|This is a fun read, there are moments when you laugh out loud, well, I did..and others where you smile. It is a feel good read. I have read lots of Scandinavian thrillers, but this is my first Scandinavian 'comedy', and I enjoyed it & have recommended it to many.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Best series I have ever read! I have read this series all the way through at least 6 times and get more out of it each time.  So much great history and an inside look of what life was like so many years ago.  Definitely an awesome read!  Can't wait for the new one to come out next year!
0060523808|5.0|Lou did a great job of telling the story of what exactly happened in IBM during the days of his service as a CEO. He focused on describing in necessary detail how it would become possible to redirect the giant organization, which tells much more than what could possibly be captured in news headlines or magazine articles. Enjoyed the reading very much.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I didn't want to put the book down. It's was really, really good. I can't wait for the next one. :)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is better than the first.  It picks up right where the first one ends.  Grabs your attention from the beginning and holds on through the rest of the book. Now onto book 3.
B009NQKXYK|1.0|I don't want to give away any of what would be called a plot, but this movie got worse the longer it went on. The best part of this movie was the cover art, well that and the closing credits
B004EI3ON4|5.0|I bought this album almost two years ago, and I still listen to it at least once a month. Daft Punk was robbed of an Oscar Nomination. This music is both moving and epic. It needs to be heard.
B003L0V758|5.0|That voice is awesome!  So glad to hear true vocals again...can't wait for the next one!  She is very talented young woman.  Brava!!
B004EWEX9Y|2.0|Although Sling Media lists the composite video cable with put the iPhone or iPad Sling Mobile App video will output to a large screen, that is not the case.  Their video shows them hooking up a Component cable.  The Composite cable only passes through the sound.  The Apple AV Adapter cable does work with an HDMI cable as stated.<br /><br />HBO Go does have a picture, but no video.  In this case it is a software issue, HBO says it will correct in the future.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|Our kids love this movie. It never get's old, they ask to watch it all the time. I like that it promotes togetherness and helps them understand the negative effects of self-indulgence. They talk often about how being greedy is destructive after watching this movie.
1419702238|5.0|my kids love this stories, they enjoy reading every night and will buy the 7 also.  will order soon the other one
B0030B624E|5.0|As a Zombie movie fan I found this one to be funnier and more entertaining than most. Even my wife liked this movie (couldn't tell ya if thats a good thing or bad).
B00846REIS|5.0|Great book! The series is an easy read and keeps you wanting to read more! Hard to put down! This is the first book of the series! The second books is even better :) Happy reading!
0517548232|5.0|This is the first book I've ever read on economics, and I'm happy I started with this one. I feel like this is a book I could read several times, and learn something new every time. Without a doubt, I will revisit it sometime in the future.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is a fast and easy read. Makes you not want to put the book down!  I highly recommend this book series!
B002OSXDAU|5.0|Ayn's philosophy \\"objectivism\\" in short makes art of a totally capitalistic free enterprise system.<br /><br />Having seen the movie over twenty years ago this book brought back memories overflowing.<br /><br />Her development of characters was the quintessential power behind the story as well as the integration of sexual tension between three of the primary characters in a postmodern 1930-40'S style, which the reader should be ever mindful of, while digesting the main story line.<br /><br />Rand's use of character identification forecasted the timbre of each character to the nth degree, in her traditional writing methodology.<br /><br />The book is a must read for anyone in the field of economics and life in general, not just the libertarian masses. In as much as Altruism is condemned throughout, some of the main characters exhibit altruistic flaws (charitable inclinations etc.) in a sincere beneficent manner.
B0098VXMNE|4.0|I thought it was a good sequel to the first season. I enjoyed the storyline, and I am looking forward to the last season.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|An enjoyable read! I read this one, as I do all Patricia Cornwell's books, especially featuring Kay Scarpetta, in my comfy chair with my blanket on my feet, and settled in! I never guess the culprit!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Loved this book as always!  I do not have any idea what I am going to do when Rick Riordan gets tired of writing about Percy Jackson.  I am an adult, and I am always excited for the next book.  This book was especially great because we have spent the last two books falling in love with the &#34;new&#34; characters.  In this book they finally all come together.  The book ends with a twist, which I love!  Keeping my fingers crossed that everything turns out like I want it to in the next book.  :-)
B003AWRMCE|5.0|Clint did his usual best as the old gunslinger William Munny. Like he said you better bury Ned right!!!! He and liquor do not mix well as he pointed out many times how he did not remember most of the evil he did while drunk!!!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|What more can you say about The Hunger Games!  I was able to purchase this book for very cheap, so I purchased multiple copies for my classroom!  A great deal, and I still can't seem to keep them on the shelf.  :-)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved the way this was written and how Ana is so relatable. Every woman knows how attractive a bad boy is and the fact that he was so involved made him irresistible.
B002MG0MF8|5.0|This is the most charming film and I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested. 5 stars all the way.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|You know how some books you just can't put down? I had a hard time picking this one up. A body is found! The murderer is evil and clever! Kay uses fancy equipment and applies chemicals! Lucy hacks and is a genius! Kay and Benton have a complex relationship! Kay and Marino have a complex relationship! The murder is solved and Kay cooks Italian! NOTHING NEW IN THIS BOOK! I was the biggest Patricia Cornwell fan for years but the last few books have been nothing but rehashes of the same Scarpetta formula.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a good game. It definitely makes you think. I am a grown woman and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great read. Not usually into books like these but from Chapter 1 I was hooked! I stayed hooked until Book 3. Sadly, the last book in this trilogy.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|This may honestly be the worst movie I have ever seen. I love these type movies and was pumped to watch this. But it was ridiculous the actors were completely un-likable and the story was dumb tying way to hard to bring God creation etc.. into this movie. Terrible
B006LSZECO|2.0|The ending was pathetic, it was like the author ran out of time on an essay or just lost interest in the story and decided to finish without ending the story. HUGE let down!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Christian Grey, you are surly from the imagination of a woman, I dont think men are at all like he is. sad but true. loved the book so much
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This game is a must have...5 stars without a doubt - best game I have found to date...Way better than Angry Birds or any of the other popular ones out there...Love it !
B007IXWL2C|5.0|what more can be said , thse books are great, I laughed I cried I got angry I love the book I love them all
B000FC0SIM|5.0|I've been writing for most of my life, and I've read many books on the mechanics of writing. Like everything King does, this book is far more than expected.<br /><br />Part autobiography, part writer's handbook, this was a very enjoyable read. The advice is direct and easy to understand, and the anecdotes are very amusing. I can't recommend this book more.<br /><br />That being said, I learned a week after making the purchase that the book is offered, free-of-charge, on King's website. I would highly recommend getting it through there and saving your $13.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Whos not in love with Christian Grey? if your female and read the book then we are all in love with him. Are ther really men like him out there????? the book is wonderful enjoyed every single page thank you for writing it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I purchased Gone Girl to read while in Cabo and it was a good choice.  The story line was fun and perfect for the beach.  I was a bit disappointed in the ending which is why I rated the book a 4 of 5 stars.  Enjoy!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Well I see that there were at least 2000 other people before me who loved this book and almost none who didn't.  That pretty much says it all, doesn't it?  I enjoy dystopian fiction and this was a fresh take on what is unfortunately a genre full of tired formulas.  I will say I am glad I purchased the omnibus edition instead of book by book as I am not sure I would have made it to Book 2 if I'd started only at Book 1 (intriguing as that was). But I was hooked by the first few pages of Book 2 and I refused to eat or sleep by the time I reached 12% left on my Kindle.<br /><br />I will let you know there is an Epilogue AFTER the \\"Author's Questions\\" section so do make sure you read that.
B001QWBM62|5.0|This product worked very well and performed as promised.  Only cautionary note is this:  it is not as easy to use for a beginner. This is more a reflection on my limited ability to intuit technical things, but if anyone else shares my impatience, they might consider a less capable item.
B009I0QTF8|4.0|i read a great review and thought id buy it. it was what the review stated. im great having it in my collection, the mood was perfect when i bought. im anxious to listen to it again with new ears.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This film is a nice blend of comedy and drama that portrays the highs and lows of young teens coming-of-age in a world of adults, some of whom are understanding and others not.  It highlights the challenges of being different and not fitting in and finding sanctuary in a sweet romantic relationship.  A very entertaining story and film!
B005FISC52|1.0|I did not get it and i email them and have not heard back for them i will not bye form them again
B009KS4XRO|1.0|this is dumb. I had to click on purchase to even make it able for me to look at it and see the reviews! I kept clicking but wouldn't respond until I hit &quot;purchase&quot;
B00336C3EY|5.0|This film isn't about 'whoopsie doopsie'. It's about the banal, monotonous quirks of culture and sub-culture synthesized by subtlety and a true understanding of high-brow comedy.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I got this game because my mom had it. I was expecting something dumb or boring but boy was I wrong I finaly had to uninstal it because I was playing CONSTANTLY at level 186 (or higher not realy sure :)) and because I had thousands of coins that would not diminish no mater how hard I tried!!  it realy is a great game save the bears and whistles
B00127RAJY|5.0|If this video is used consistently you will notice your body change.  It is a great work out and not too hard where you want to give up.  It targets different areas and you feel refreshed after the work out knowing that you made a difference physically to your body.
1451627297|5.0|This has been said many times; \\"Stephen King has done it again.\\" However, I think this truly is his crowning achievement. He took one of the most darkest events in the history of America and turned it into an epic journey combining actual events and people along with fictional events and characters. The story beings with the main character, Jake Epping (I love how the last name describes him. Epping meaning he goes on an Epic journey), a high school/GED teacher who's friend, Al Templeton owns a diner that has a time portal in it's pantry. The time portal transfers anyone who walks in there to September 9th, 1958. Al who is now sick and dying of lung cancer asks Jake to go back in time to prevent the Kennedy Assassination. After Al briefs him on how the time portal works and how to be careful in the past, Jake agrees to carry on the mission not only for his dying friend but for America itself. Not only does Jake, who now goes by the name George Amberson in the past try to prevent JFK's death, he also prevents other past dangers from happening while also making a new life for himself. On the book jacket of this book, it tells us that the story portrays time travel as more realistic. This book surely does. I won't go into detail on how because those who haven't read it yet need to read it for themselves. The things that I really like about this book is how King has actual people interact with fictional characters. I also like how detailed the book is. In other words; there's an explanation for everything. Probably my most favorite part of the book is the price. The price for saving a person's life. I won't give any spoilers away but I will say this; saving John F. Kennedy's life. Those who were living in 1963 remember how sad and unsafe they felt but, what would have happened to the country had he lived? I know that most people like to believe that the country would have been much better off but where's the real proof to that? Of course, no one has the answer to that question but just look at the possibilities. Look at what JFK did between the years of 1961 and 1963 and look at the future. Think; \\"How would he have done that differently?\\" Anyway, Stephen King's 11/22/63 is a masterpiece. Although he is known to being the Godfather of Horror, I believe that this is his true masterpiece! My only criticism of the book is this; why did it have to end? Was an ending really necessary?
B0072BNSH2|5.0|This almost always hits the dvd player if we've been out on the town and weren't ready to go to bed once the bars close. If you're a fan of the Chemical Brothers, big beat, or techno, you owe it to yourself to get this. The sound is phenomenal, the track selection seems to get better as the concert goes on, and the crowd shots really bring the energy to the forefront. I especially like the unreleased song, Superflash. I can see why the small theatrical release had audiences going bonkers, some of which had to be shut down. It's that much fun to watch! TURN IT UP!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|It's been awhile since a book has kept me up into the middle of the night, but I had to keep reading this one.  Loved the fact that this book took place in London as it's my favorite place in Europe.  Have to see if Elizabeth Haynes has other books to be absorbed in!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I got it for me but my son who is 4 years old loved too.....its addictive and brain challenge!!! I love it!
0525478817|5.0|I had never read a John Green book before. This was an amazing book! I gave the book 5 stars because it was a great read for both boys and girls. I am an art teacher and talk often with my students about the books they read. I suggest this book often. The students love it. The story if the two falling in love through dealing with their cancer is amazing. I was literally taking a bubble bath reading the end and was sobbing at the end. It was an amazing read!
B004TI1WME|5.0|It works great on my kindle fire! I use it a lot! It is very easy to use and really useful!
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|I treat it like a motivated factors when my mood was down! I enjoy sharing the story when I encourage some of my friends!
B008TRUDAS|4.0|the story between layken and will is undenyingly heart warming. there was a point where i was so frustrated with will for making it so harder to just admit his feelings for layken. especially in the sequel \\"point of \\"retreat is told in wills point of view really gives you a perspective of what is going on in his little brain. ultimately the story between these characters is amazing. will keep you rooting for them til the end
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft pocket edition is amazing, i reccomend buying the full version even if it is $7.00... it is so worth it and progressing rapidly towards pc but still far away
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|this is a really great deal. All the original movies, lots of movie extras, and the Captains Summit.  Great value for a Trek fan.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Again, this is my first time reading this type of book.  I'm so hooked I bought the third book.  This trilogy has it all;<br />and it's a very fast read.  It's hard to put down.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|My 5 &amp; 7 year old love it!  Two year old brother loves to watch.  It's on a Kindle Fire....I may have to buyanother.
B009KHBDUU|3.0|No surprise the visuals were top notch, but was unable to keep one's attention as one might expect from an action-orinted movie. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it and have no regrets. It's all about expectations!
B00094OBS4|5.0|loaded with past stars plyin as strong as ever i stubbled on to on net flix, had to have it after seing it so bought it on amason
B005LVR6ZA|3.0|This book did hold my interest, although at times just to figure out the plot.  The author does a good job of tying together many loose ends, but it takes a concerted effort to make sense of the unusual twists and turns.  I enjoyed the book, but I suspect not everyone will.
B003TNM2K6|5.0|This is one of the best horror movies i have ever seen! Out standing performance by Thomas Jane and the rest of the cast, they did a great job bringing a great Stephen King story to life.
B005IEF27O|5.0|I've been a long time Primus fan, and I can honestly say this is the best release in a LONG time. The drumming is fantastic - the grooves are so tasty with excellent cymbal work. All I can say is, PRIMUS SUCKS!!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I'm totally addicted to this game and I can play all day and nite. I'm about to play to get myself to sleep now.
B006ON41FC|5.0|it was a beat game I wish you good luck. p.s. do not hit the toxick nuts nor the fire nuts those are bad
B009VB97EY|2.0|I had been looking forward to watching this film because it received decent reviews and a good box office so I thought \\"Hey, maybe it's good\\" ... the dialogue was awful, the acting not much better.  The only entertaining parts were the actual strip shows but everything in between was clunky and boring.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|This is SUCH a fantastic movie! The music is wonderful (I also have the soundtrack), and Gerard Butler as the Phantom is superb!! I'm not usually a big fan of musicals, but this almost doesn't even seem like a musical to me. Perhaps it's because action is actually happening while they're singing and they don't just stand around and sing.<br /><br />This movie is a must have for anyone who enjoys beautiful music, great story, and, of course, Gerard Butler.
B004LWZW7Y|4.0|This film was funny, and charming. After the unfunny mess Shrek had become Puss is a welcome breath of fresh air.  This movie was truly enjoyable not just for kids but adults.  It's smart so as much as the kids will enjoy it so will the parents.
B000F8O35U|5.0|This movie is so great, and to me was the start of those great modern-day Disney movies that we all love. The packaging was flawless, still in it's original plastic covering. The DVD was scratch-free and the movies and special features played perfectly
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Read 50% of this book and am still waiting for some kind of a story and not such explicit scenes.  Not for me thank you.  Decided to delete and not waste any more time.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|Probably my favorite album. Dance and sing to it all the time. Puts me in a great mood. Great bargain.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book has made it into my list of all time faves. Superior writing, gripping story line, well-developed characters. I always end up guessing the predictable endings in books and there was no possible way to guess this one. Buckle up and enjoy the ride -- this book is tons of literary fun! (And better than her previous two books.)
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I like the location of her the character's work life. Being a New Englander many of the places in the book are familiar which makes it even more interesting for me. The characters remain as interesting as usual and new developments in their lives add to the interest and intrigue.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Well the kids love playing this game on their Kindle Fire tablets (original, not HD) and it seems to work fine, just this free version, on the Kindle Fire.<br /><br />WiFi is always off when the kids play with their tablets, so I don't know if this game would do anything bad with WiFi enabled, like try to make them buy stuff or show lots of ads.<br /><br />They used to love playing all the Angry Birds games, and I guess they eventually got a bit tired of those, so this is something new and different, and seems good enough to hold their interest for a while.

B0076DCT2G|5.0|Very interesting and a long story, I love long stories. I always wait for his books, I wish he would write faster..
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much I didn't even \\"wonder\\" much @ August' afflictions. So well written, all genres can enjoy it. It allows you to relive your childhood(if you want to) and ponder WHY there are bullies? And, what did I do to deserve that? You can't change how you look sometimes, but your attitude can usually get you through. Applause to the author for a job well done.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|Saw the previews for Dark Shadows when it was in the theaters and thought it would be funny and enjoyable to watch.  Didn't plan on seeing it in the theater and opted to either rent it or stream it.  Definitely glad I didn't waste my money on it in the theater and regret spending the $3.99 to stream it.  Not even sure I would be happy to have spent $1.00 at Redbox on it.<br /><br />Based on the previews I was expecting a comedy.  While there were a few lines that I didn't see in the previews it definitely wasn't a comedy.  It wasn't even frightening.  Honestly don't know what to call it except boring.  I am reminded of a Brad Paisley video where Shatner comments after Brad questions what he (Shatner) thought of the video.  Shatner said \\"I liked the end... when the music stopped.\\".  Well I never have seen a movie where I was glad to see the credits.  Sadly I had to wake myself up a little just to realize the movie had ended.  I would call it the sleeper hit of 2012... literally.
B001O1O71C|5.0|This book is extremely well written in displaying the innocense of children and their total trust in their family, their education by their parents and the world around them in such a difficult set of circumstances.  This book is a must read, although sad, can definitely represent a true situation.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I read all three books in about 1 week. Really enjoyed the first and had to read on to find out what happened next.  I must admit, that once in the third book, I started to tire of the sex scenes that had become really repetitive and started skimming quickly or even skipping them so I could get to more of the other story that was going on.  I enjoyed more of the story behind all the sex, what made Christian the way he was and seeing his character evolve from the before Ana days to after.  Overall, it was a good read.  I also enjoyed the parts from Christian's point of view at the end of book 3, and I hope there is another book in the future.  Along those lines, I think Stephanie Mayer made a mistake in the Twilight series by not carrying on with Midnight Sun and E.L. James should not make the same mistake.
B0062OCNAI|4.0|This is my second read by this author.  The story was really good and I raced through the book. I think all her books are really engaging and great reads.

B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is a nice lil app. It came in real handy @ stores and cookie sales! Very easy to use.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book and found myself staying up an extra hour because I did not want to put it down. It flowed easily and left me wanting more.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|The individual stories that comprise Cloud Atlas have insufficient reason to be joined together. Some of them are more engaging than others, but the overall effect for me was of an experiment that doesn't come off. A particular problem is the juxtaposition of science fiction material with realist, modernist material. Beyond the lack of sufficent thematic connection between all the parts of the book, the genre incongruency didn't work for me.
B006CBSE86|5.0|Out of all the Nightwish albums, this is by far my favorite for a number of reasons. The lyrics all tell a story, and they stimulate your mind far more than most songs these days could ever hope. The entire album is varied, some songs are harder, some softer, some right in the middle but every single one of them is memorable. This album is a must for my playlists on long drives.
0307895475|5.0|A very helpful game guide which is also reasonably priced (considering the amount of content it covers). It contains recipes for all crafting professions (smithing, alchemy, cooking etc.), a walk-through of all main quests and side quests (including guild quests such as: companions, mages college, dark brotherhood, thieves guild) and also dawnguard quests. Also contains information on every weapon, piece of equipment, spells, shouts, books, unique items, treasure maps and location of every rare item. A comprehensive tour of every single location, every major location receives A walk-through including maps and locations of important items. A large 2-sided map poster in also included which includes all dawnguard territories. I would recommend this guide to anyone who would like to have a more in-depth, vast knowledge of the game.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I was eagerly awaiting the next John Corey story.  I read it in a day.  It was<br />fast paced and moved along quickly.  I did not want it to end.  My only complaint<br />would be that the ending left me wanting more.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|My husband who watches TV constantly can not stand it when I play this game. Great time waster!  Wish there were different puzzles rather than a design that you just follow with your finger.
B008AX1HD8|4.0|Hole's first adventure takes him to the great Australian serial killer case mentioned so often in the other stories. The geography is not always right and there are only a couple of idioms rendered slightly awry. For this Aussie, Harry really did come to Oz.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|its really fun but it gets hard to play because the keys are so small and its hardto move around to get the keys but other than that i highly recomend it i cant stop playing it!
B009CG3M1C|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I didn't want to watch it because everyone had panned the movie but my mom, sister-in-law and her children, my friends and my children really enjoyed it.  It just goes to show we should check out things on our own.<br /><br />I definitely should have seen this in the movie theater.  It was pretty good.  Is it great? NO! It is a leave your brain outside the door sci-fi movie and I liked the alien spin on it.  It was a bit slow in the beginning but they were just setting up the characters.  There were some truly funny moments in the beginning.  As the movie went on, I really began to love the characters.<br /><br />I am glad I had a change of heart in deciding to watch it.  Normally if I don't watch a big blockbuster in the movie, I don't watch it at home either.  I lose all interest even if its 10 years down the line.  If you haven't seen it, check it out!  It's a big fun movie.
0142418471|3.0|This was required reading for the GLBT unit in my YA Lit class, and when I saw it was in first-person present tense, I knew I would find it extremely difficult to read.  However, I ended up really getting into the gay Will Grayson's chapters, written by David Levithan.  That particular story really worked well with first-person present tense, something I can only say about 1% of all the first-person present books I've ever read or attempted to read.  That Will has such an authentic, angsty, distinct teen voice.  There were lots of funny lines and moments in the gay Will's chapters, like his commentary on the term LOL, the revelation that his friend Simon pleasures himself to video game characters including Warlocks, and his frenemy Maura's despairing poetry.<br /><br />I had a much harder time getting into the nerdy, straight Will's story, written by John Green.  The main reason, of course, was because of the distracting first-person present tense.  That is SUCH a non-intuitive, bizarre way to narrate a novel.  \\"I do this.  I do that.  I say this.  I say that.\\"  Some stories work very well with third-person present, if you know how to write it well and understand when it's effective.  But first-person present is just so awkward and distracting to read, with very few exceptions.  I think it works in certain kinds of memoirs, short pieces of fiction, and books narrated by extremely young characters, but for YA contemporary, it's so out of place.  (Don't even get me started on the oversaturation of first-person period in modern YA!)  Seeing it in print just makes me angry, and I normally stop reading when I see a book has that tense/POV combo.<br /><br />The straight Will didn't seem like as much of an active player in his own story, so dominated was he by his larger than life gay best friend Tiny.  His voice also didn't seem distinctive enough to merit being first-person (besides the fact that first-person is so predominant in modern YA, and thus seemingly often chosen out of a mistaken belief that it's expected).  The gay Will's story would've been interesting enough for an entire book, but I felt the straight Will's story didn't have enough of a hook or plot structure.  It was also very hard to imagine any high school in America putting on a play like Tiny's, even in an &uuml;ber-liberal area like Greenwich Village or Berkeley.<br /><br />I'm also not a fan of this YA trend of alternating narrators/POV characters.  If you're really into one character's story, it's frustrating to switch gears for a whole chapter and focus on someone you might not like as much.  By the time the book gets back to the other character, his story might not be as fresh in your mind.  I don't know what so many writers these days have against the tried and true third-person omniscient, and why so many modern YA writers are convinced their book NEEDS to be first-person present tense.<br /><br />I enjoyed the gay Will's chapters and would've preferred the entire book be from his perspective.  I just wish more of a hook and distinctive voice had been used for the straight Will's chapters.  I think it's safe to say I probably won't be interested in Mr. Green's other books, though I might be interested in some of Mr. Levithan's other books.n out of a mistaken belief that it's expected).

B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Really fun puzzle game similar to Bejeweled with a side story to keep things interesting.  The $5 price tag is too high for this short game though.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|The First book was so good that I had to rush into the second book.  Now, I have to wait, and wait, for the last book of the<br />trilogy and the \\"family tree's\\" of everyone will have to be reviewed.  No one should read the second book without reading the<br />initial book which sets the story in motion.  Excellent reading.
B009JNXK88|5.0|The game is fun if you like fast paced (for touch controls anyway) platforming and trying to navigate levels as quickly and efficiently as possible to get three stars similar to super meat boy.  The graphics are a nice throwback to the old days and the controls are tight on my kindle fire. This is definitely one to check out.

B0018RA6DK|5.0|I've ALWAYS loved this film.  Although it's early 80's material, the on-screen chemistry between Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte is a joy to watch!  This movie has it all:  Humor, action, drama, violence all set in the the Bay Area.  The sequel is also one to catch.....full of action.  Wanna re-live an old favorite....or catch a film perhaps that was a bit before your time....but is guaranteed to please?  Catch that famous scene where Eddie Murphy goes into a redneck, cowboy bar (Torchy's) and \\"B.S.'s\\" his way through a very dangerous environment.<br /><br />\\"There's a new Sheriff in town........and his name is Reggie Hammond!\\"<br /><br />Rent it, buy it TODAY!  You'll be glad you did!
B002GHHHP6|2.0|Ignore the previous posts that complained about the movie.  I give this movie 5 stars and I've seen it probably 20 times and love it!  The only reason I rated it 2 stars is so that people who just click to see the low stars and take the few peoples' crappy opinions into account, that they may read mine and watch this movie.<br /><br />Some of the previous people's 2 star reviews say Mel was not witty, intellegent, and that the movie was not funny.  Or I think one person even complained that it shouldn't have been funny and that it wasn't a real western or something.  Duh, It's a comedy.  It's not supposed to be a real western.  And complaining about the western movie cliches?  Why does every shot in a movie have to be 100% original to call it a good movie?  I personally like western cliches.  And even if I didn't....the overall feel of the movie after you watch it is.....\\"i was fun, entertaining, and hilarious so WATCH ME AGAIN!\\"  I can't stand it when people nit-pic every little thing in a movie without any real good reasons to call it a bad movie.<br /><br />The movie IS very funny.  Mel Gibson does a great job playing a witty, intellegent, smart-elic, poker player.  He uses wit and smart-elic remarks to get under people's skin and kinda get on their nerves.  But at the same time he's very likable.  Just as Jodie foster says in the movie \\"you're so....irritating, but likable!\\"  Mel's very funny, smart, witted acting is the reason I like to watch this movie again and again.<br /><br />The entire movie it seems he can't trust the woman he's with or any of his friends to not screw him over, which adds a fun spin around every corner.  The jokes are funny, the story is good, Mel Gibson's acting is GREAT.  Forget what those other people said.  In my opinion, this is my FAVORITE character ever played by Mel Gibson.  He's funny, witty, and such a smart-elic that you can't help but like him.  GREAT movie.  Must see!!<br /><br />On a side note....The only thing I didn't care for was Jodie Foster's fake southern accent.  Horrible accent.  But other than that the movie is great.  See it.
B008OOYALE|3.0|it passes the time by... still board and still playing but it cost me money to play sometimes thoughts gold bars should be cheeper.
B008YRVW0I|2.0|This game was OK. I got the free version and it played for a few levels then quit. I needed to buy the full version. I generally don't buy games or games that one needs to purchase coins/stars or whatever to get very far into the game. Makers have the right to do so, and I support that right. But I don't have to play them.

B007THA4FI|1.0|A great writer for kids with deep imagination and mystery, but this latest novel aimed at adults is wanting. A detailed intrigue in a small village that is too deep and self absorbing, with shallow characters that are not interesting. I'm for devious characters in a book; but not boring, which these are.<br /><br />Better luck with the next novel....
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|The best part of any Wes Anderson film is the supreme attention to detail. This one doesn't stray from that detailed atmosphere. It conjures up nostalgia for a place you've never been to.

B009NQKPUW|3.0|It was nice to see where the Aliens came from however even that left me a little confused as to how so many could have been created.  The plot seemed to go in too many directions with it lacking direction, maybe they wanted to leave their options wide open for the next in the series.  Overall entertaining.

1439153663|5.0|I enjoy books that expand my views of the world and of history while capturing my interest.  This was a worthy read that ended in a way that was positive and hopeful (even though it was a rough ride to get there).  Kathleen Grissom knows how to develope characters in a way that readers care and emotionally connect to them.<br /><br />This left me hungry for more on the history of endentured servants.

B007FEFLTO|3.0|I enjoyed the book very much. There was one major problem with the e-edition for my Kindle. Starting at approximately 60% (page numbers not available), the first 5 or 6 \\"pages\\" of EACH new chapter were missing. I had to keep reading, having gotten that far in the book, and it was a good read. I hoped that the \\"glitch\\" wouldn't keep happening, but it did. For the entire rest of the book, at the start of a new chapter. I hope this can be resolved for other future readers. Knowing this ahead of buying and starting the book, I wouldn't have chosen to do so.<br /><br />My rating has nothing to do with the writer's ability to relate a great, historical novel.
B009NPM5Y2|4.0|If you like musicals this is definitely one to watch.  Just plain fun and great music!  It was slow moving on a few occasions but all in all I really enjoyed it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I'm not understanding the reviews for the kindle fire. I have been using  this app since the summer and it works perfectly. I love it you get to choose your own song to wake you up or choose what ever sound thats on your device. Compatible with the youtube downloader. If you downloaded a song it appears on here too ^_^ Plus, there is a increasing volume to max as a choice and it is VERY loud &gt;_&gt; Anyway, overall five stars~
B0088WFZQG|3.0|The action I believe was very realistic, but the movie was made for someone who knows and understands the military and all the acronyms - my husband enjoyed it, but I was confused during many of the transitions and felt that what was being done was never explained.
B003O5MOES|3.0|I was prompted to purchase this record, The Ghost of Tom Joad, by Bruce Springsteen, after having heard several of the cuts on YouTube -- various versions of some of the better known songs, including The Ghost of Tom Joad, Youngstown, and The NewTimer.  I love these beautiful and powerful songs, but on the whole, was a bit disappointed in the recording itself.<br /><br />I am far from being a recording expert, but it seems that many times the recording or mixing or whatever allows Bruce's voice to drop so low that it is almost as though he were mumbling to himself.  That's really too bad, because the songs themselves are excellent.  I think the format -- the soft thoughtfulness, the instrumentation and all fit the nature of these songs, but when Bruce's voice becomes so low that it is difficult to make out the words, that's not a good thing.<br /><br />Overall, I liked the album because the material is good.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|Ghost Protocol reminds me a bit of the old Bond movies before all the fun was drained out of them; there are over-the-top set pieces, silly gadgets and interesting locales. The main antagonist wasn't really compelling or threatening- if they'd spent some more time fleshing him out it would have been even better. The ensemble cast has great chemistry and this was by far my favorite movie in the series.
B001BC5HXG|4.0|This is clearly a great novel. There is crime and psychopathology and horror. There is adventure. There is lyricism. It does drag in places where it preaches about deeply old fashioned values and dissects. There is definitley something old fashioned about it.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|Story line fun! Collect pieces to get to advance. Going to second game now! Only thing I wanna know is,where is my gal Kira? Guess I gotta play it to fond out.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This final book takes over right at the end of the second book, and there is non-stop action throughout.  As Katniss discovers that she has a much larger role in events than she ever thought of, or wanted, she also has to decide who is the love of her life.  Team Peeta?  Team Gale?  Not so cut and dried a choice as in other series.<br /><br />The ending is somewhat abrupt, but does provide the ultimate resolution to the series.<br /><br />All in all, a great series for young people, and people young of heart at any age.
B003OJBWGA|5.0|Great vinyl album for all those retro fans out there.  Ordered this album for my son's friend for a surprise birthday present.  Who knew records would come back into vogue?
B005LAIIE4|4.0|Remember the old video games in the arcades of the 80's? They are incredibly represented here and in a very fun way. The film does have a middle section that was slow and a little off track, but with that said, `Wreck It Ralph' does have a fantastic opening and definitely a surprising and eventfully fun ending! The animation is very sharp and extremely real. (Not phot-real, but artistically real.)<br /><br />`Wreck It Ralph' is director Richard Moore's (Futurama, Drawn Together) first feature film coming from a broad television animation background. Taking a script from Phil Johnston (Cedar Rapids, Ghost/Aliens) and first time writer Jennifer Lee, Richard mixed a great deal of personality types and funny creative situations inside of a video game and the world they live in.<br /><br />The games you see in this film are all familiar to those who remember the stand-up, giant boxed TV sets you used to look down at and play your games with. The graphics were simple and the music very distinct with each game environment along with all the sound effects that only came from the 80`s. I had lots of memories of all the games!<br /><br />John C Reilly (Chicago, Magnolia) leads the cast as `Wreck It Ralph' himself who has the odd job of being the villain in his game. Alone, mistreated and often misunderstood he decides to get some recognition by getting an award. With the help of the hysterical Jane Lynch (Glee, 40 Year-Old Virgin) as demanding and pushy militaristic leader of grunts, Calhoun, Ralph gets a little miss directed and off course ending up in many strange games, but none are his own.<br /><br />Now `Wreck It Ralph' has a star in its game called Felix, voiced so sympathetically and humorously dry by Jack McBrayer (30 Rock, Forgetting Sarah Marshall). Jack's innocence and sincerity make the movie so much more fun to watch. I loved observing his take on growing a `fancy' for Jane Lynch's  Calhoun character and how slowly they realize they might just work together, as a couple.<br /><br />Ralph enters a game, wrongly of course, that is based a Candyland-type environment, and accidently bumps into and later, begrudgingly, befriends a small `glitch' in the program who is named Venellope, voiced amazingly perfect by Sarah Silverman (Something About Mary, School Of Rock) . She is independent, stubborn, obnoxious, not responsible and wildly out of hand, but seems to be sweet and sincere enough for Ralph to help.<br /><br />A special note to Alan Tudyk (Firefly, I, Robot), who plays King Candy and does an amazingly unique impression of what might be consider `The Mad Hatter' with his own twist. Alan gives such fun and flair and craziness to his candy obsessed royalty.<br /><br />Without giving too much away, the movie has a fun concept of group therapy for bad guys, an inventive concept on how game characters travel from one game to another and a clever plot concept on how games need to understand, they all need each other. I also loved the great detail and 3-D stylization they used to represent the accuracy of how all these old games really moved and operated.  `Wreck It Ralph' has a great family message in the really funny and creative world of 80's video games. This is great light family fun!a couple.<br /><br />Ralph enters a game, wrongly of course, that is based a Candyland-type environment, and accidently bumps into and later, begrudgingly, befriends a small `glitch' in the program who is named Venellope, voiced amazingly perfect by Sarah Silverman (Something About Mary, School Of Rock) .

B005LAII8K|3.0|Bruce Willis (Die Hard, Pulp Fiction) always seems to choose his films with high action and adventure and a lot of gun fire too, `Looper' does have all that, but it is woven into a story that involves a character, stopping himself from doing something in the past by himself. Confused? Looping time travel is what makes this film a little confusing.<br /><br />Director Rian Johnson (Breaking Bad, Brick) took his own original script but made it more philosophical and less about the characters. It was a little slow in getting its legs until of course you figured out who was the bad guy and what his objective was. Past meets future and future meets past. Yes, confusing at some points and a little more than weird in others.<br /><br />Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Inception, 500 Days of Summer) does an impressive job of not believing himself from the future but ultimately makes a choice that changes his own history.  It's like back To The Future II, rewriting the present to change the future and suffering the consequences, but BTTF was so much better! Oh and Joseph and Bruce are the same person. I'll say no more.<br /><br />Emily Blunt (The Adjustment Bureau, The Muppets) played an very troubled and intense mother of a boy who is more than what he seems. In fact, he is the key to the film and then in turn, the key to everyone in the films future. Pierce Gagnon (One Tree Hill) plays the son with enormous intensity and he has a great `evil' look that really sells the concept of what is going on. Pierce is very creepy too!<br /><br />Now a twist for a really great actor was Jeff Daniels (Dumb & Dumber, Speed) performance as a man with an ulterior motive and playing a baddie with some seriously weak henchmen! He is fun to watch and intense in the madness of his mission! Another notable performance is that of Paul Dano (There Will be Blood, Little Miss Sunshine) who really does fear and panic well. Paul also gives great motivation for the time travelling of Joseph and Bruce's character.<br /><br />I am being vague because it's hard not to say too much without giving things away. The film has a great empathic score by Nathan Johnson (Blue State, The Day I Saw Your Heart) and some basics time travel effects that keep the story first.<br /><br />Overall I was not impressed with the pace of the film. It took a long time to get going, but once it did it really did become interesting. Not a family film, but definitely film with a twisted family story. I would wait for the DVD/Blu-Ray for this one!r.<br /><br />I am being vague because it's hard not to say too much without giving things away.

B0054YHB36|5.0|Look, any casual or non-Mariah Carey fan wouldn't appreciate this album. The people who fall into those categories would be perturbed that not enough dance songs or up tempo songs are apart of this LP. But people have to realize that it's not always about those type of songs or sure-shot filler songs that pander to the public, but that it's about well written and produced music. Music Box was a peaceful and ethereal album that any true Mariah fan would enjoy.    \\"Hero\\" and \\"Dreamlover\\" got all the attention they deserved back in the day, and people to this day still love Hero as they should. Hero makes you want to achieve your goals and stop feeling sorry for yourself.    The title track, \\"Music Box\\" is priceless. That is my favorite song on the album, with beautiful double vocals by Mariah coupled with tender/peaceful background musical production. I could listen to that song anyday and when I want to feel peace. One of the best parts of the song was from the 3:12 to the 3:16 mark of the song with Mariah's charateristic high register and dreamy piano and keyboard production in the background. That song should have been a bigger hit, I love that song.    \\"Now That I Know\\" is an upbeat quintessential early 1990s production. You feel like you flashed back to 1993 when you listen to that song. Track 6 or \\"Never Forget You\\" could serve as a sentimental love song that could also easily take you back to 1993.    I don't care what anyone says, but Mariah murdered Track 7 \\"Without You\\" and I think it sounded better than the original and I mean that with no disrespect to the original artists (Badfinger) who sung the song. And the public responded by making it one of the hottest singles of 1994. To me that was one of Mariah's best songs she ever sung. I love how she drags the \\"I Can't Live Anymore\\" part for so long and doesn't want to let the note go just like a dog wouldn't want to let go of a raw T-bone steak.    Track 8, \\"Just to Hold You Once Again\\" was an underrated gem.I like the chorus in the background too.    Track 9, \\"I've Been Thinking About You\\" was another early 1990s quintessential production and a song one can still dance to in 2012. Don't front, you know doggone well you can jam to that song on the dance floor or in your car, I know I could. I have always liked at the :36 to :37 second marks, how she put emphasis on \\"Now, I WANT More\\". Meaning that she wants more than mere thoughts about a guy she knows, she wants a relationship dammit!    Track 10, \\"All I Ever Wanted\\" is my second favorite track on the album as that song is a cool way to end a great album. I don't know how many times around my house I have sung that song out loud. It's so peaceful and a quintessential Mariah ballad.    Walter Afanasieff as usual deserves credit too for the great success of this album. He and Mariah are a match made in heaven, their styles are too priceless for words.    Listening to this album sometimes makes me want to go back to fifth grade and bask in the heyday of my favorite singer of all time, Mrs. Mariah Carey.
0307949508|3.0|This second book of steve larsson is like the opening book of the series, not the first one, It seems like Mr Larsson foresee the reach of the story until he finish the first one and in this one he start to play with different stories that are not finished at the end of the book.  Half of the book seems that the author is rambling around with the character, looking to do something with her or maybe he start to humanize the Salander Character, but he fails to give a coherent story and it seems that the true story begins half the book.  But the book is very entertaining with several good twists but also making Salandar almost a superhero.  Something that bothers me was a couple of similitudes with an awful book, \\"The lost Symbol\\", both books has a giant as an asessin and in both books the main character \\"Die\\".  Coincedence ???<br /><br />Anyway this book makes an excelent travel companion, and if you can overcome the slow begining of the book, you are going to inmerse yourself very easyly.
B001NZMWPM|5.0|love old school (gen-x) musik and for a good price. the scorpions were a really great band at their peak.
145210655X|5.0|I love it! If you're a die-hard Star Wars fan the references are spot on and if not the illustrations are adorable. This book can give you an instant laugh anytime- over and over!
B0096C7QF0|5.0|If you enjoyed Joe Bonamassa Live From The Royal Albert Hall, then you can't miss this album. Joe at his best. I don't think many blues guitarists can rival Joe Bonamassa when it comes to striking out the blues on his Les Paul. Excellent album. Great addition to any blues collection.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|See other reviews. Was a personal let down for me. Purchased only to supplement my Alien series movie collection. My views most closely match these reviewers:<br /><br />Take the Scientist's Survival Pop Quiz v2.0!, September 23, 2012<br />just awful, October 20, 2012<br />Prometheus is a Very Bad Movie-theus., October 2, 2012<br /><br />The special effect were cool, but too bad when I stick it in I can't bare to watch more than 10 minutes of it.
