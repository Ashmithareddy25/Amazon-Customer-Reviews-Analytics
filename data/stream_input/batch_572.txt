0784011710|4.0|I saw this movie when it was first on video, maybe 15 years ago.  My sister-in-law had rented it for us to watch as she had seen it and thought I would enjoy it.  It was during the Thanksgiving holidays, and I'll never forget how this little film practically ruined my Thanksgiving!  I was so terribly depressed after watching it, I couldn't get it out of my mind. No other film has ever struck me that way.  Word to the wise:  don't see this if you are a mother with young kids (my youngest two, a boy & a girl, were little at the time).  You won't be able to get Sophie's \\"Choice\\" out of your head.  Otherwise, it was a great film, no doubt.  Superb acting, writing, cinematography, you name it.  Just terribly, horribly sad.  Period.
B000ASATWQ|5.0|Jr. Gong has done it Again. This CD has something for anyone, it mature aproach transcends the artists age. \\"There for you\\" is a masterpiece.
B000CBSHK2|4.0|On this disc, BO decided to retreat a bit from the overproduced, slick approach of her last record, and it pays off...more low-key, with a more songful approach, if you will.
B000AY3KN0|4.0|There are quite a few DVD incarnations of the original KING KONG available.  This must be the best.  The features are top notch, and the transfer of the actual film is as good as we can expect.  Don't worry about the Region 1 logo; my player indicates that these two discs are Region 0.
B00009Z574|3.0|This isnt the best Yes album to be released, and there is a world of difference in sound between this and the release before it \\"Going for the One\\" yet this is still a good effort. LIke most Progressive Rock bands of the time such as Floyd and Rush, once the early 1980's hit, those bands started to use more synthesizers and eletric drums, but YES was always seemed to be 10steps ahead of everyone else, and this is the album where we here \\"Yes\\" starting to use heavy synthesizers and more watered down songs. Yet this is still a good YES album, and there are are 2 tracks that really sparkle, but some of the album is a bit dull you can start to hear the direction that the band would take in the 1980's, which was to turn from a progressive rock band and start to get into the mix of pop rock. Its not a horrible thing, as some of the 1980's releases are still solid, but nothing will ever top the material they wrote in the early 70's. ENJOY
0553801503|3.0|What was a highly anticipated novel has fizzled.  I get the sense with the droning on in many chapters about nothing interesting, that Martin has taken a lesson from Jordan and is potentially ruining what has been the best fantasy series in many years.  The next release will determine whether Martin maintains greatness or fizzles into mediocrity like Jordan.
B000BKVQTS|1.0|This movie is embarassing.  Why would anyone make a movie like this?  How did it make it to theatres when really good films are going straight to DVD?  I could not stand to watch this film, and had to turn it off after fast forwarding several times through much of the first half . . . question for Matt Damon:  How COULD you?  After Bourne?  You can't possibly need the money that badly!
B000E8QVWY|5.0|What a wonderful experience.   Phoenix and Witherspoon are two of the rising stars of Hollywood and it is a pure pleasure to see them shine in this picture.  It's amazing how musically talented the two are also and how well they blended together.  They have an on-stage chemistry much like Johnny and June had.   Both actors strongly deserve Oscars for this home run of a film.     I liked how Johnny handled tragedy in his life and how he used his spirituality to lift himself up to a new level.  J.C. blazed his own trail and was not afraid.      If you are interested in the late JC's music, check out the work of Roseanne Cash.  She is putting out marvelous music, much improved from her early years.

B000AMJDHY|5.0|I love this cd i own it and listen to it everyday as im getting ready in the morning. I dont think my dad likes it but i listen to it anyway. I have to listen to it low on a couple of songs because of the language because my brother is 7. This cd is really good my favorite song on the cd is build god then we'll talk because i love the music at 2 min 55 and the lyrics are really catchy and observant. i love it when he says \\"the constible and his proposition for the virgin yes the one he met with on strickly buissness as he said to the misses.\\"  <br /> <br />the video for I write sins not tragedies is really cool and original. I love the girl with the beard. it's also cool that they did it in the same house as the devils rejects. thats awesome. <br /> <br />the idea of half being the future and the second half nostalgic is very cool. i cant wait till their next video and i cant wait to start seeing more of their faces in magazines because their all really cute. lol.

B0000BYM3K|5.0|Hello all, if you don't know me by know I'm one of the people who actually like all the material maiden's come out with. <br />First off I'd like to say that bruce delivers some very great vocals on this album, he's in top form if you ask me. <br />Secondly the guitars are great, when maiden did the 3 guitars thing I thought what an awesome concept for the band and so far it's really seemed to have payed off for them. <br />Lastly to all you bashers, what the hell? are you never happy? <br />First you complain when adrian leaves and bash the next two albums, then bruce leaves and you bash the bayley albums, then bruce and adrian both come back and you bash them for not sounding the same. <br />It really seems to me like you are never happy, that for some odd reason you were expecting the sound of the 80's, well I'm sorry to be so blunt to you all but the 80's are over and are never coming back, I think maiden has done a stellar Job of progressing themselves and unless they want to repeat the mistakes of the glam rock bands I'm pretty sure they are going to keep on progressing. <br />So for the \\"true\\" maiden fans, keep on listening and I'm sure you'll never be disapointed and for all you bashers out there just quit listening in the vain hope that they'll sound like they did in the early to mid 80's they aren't going to and it's actually kind of naive of you to think that they will. <br /> <br />may maiden keep on rocking

B000005RS0|5.0|Let's see. Tina Turner was born in 1939 and made music since the 1950s so she has been living and performing many moons before Brataney Sneers was ever alive. Also, Tina can sing and DANCE at the same time without losing her breath unlike Brataney who has to lip-synch cos she doesn't take care of herself. When Private Dancer was released pallies, Tina proved that she could succeed without Ike Turner. This album was huge and hit #3 in America pallies. Songs like What's Love Got To Do With It, Better Be Good to Me and the title cut were all huge hits on the album and still sound good today.
B00000099Y|5.0|To the religious person inappropriately posting a review here: <br /> <br />First off, you shouldn't be talking about that here. This is a review for a CD that I would imagine most people would have either been referred to by Amazon's interest detection system, because they know someone who listens to this music, they are interested in the music, etc... You shouldn't come here to post you rheteric and personal issues against this type of music. Second off, your claims have little basis and foundation in reality as do most claims I have heard from most people who attempt to inappropriately anaylze and pin-point specific influences in a very complex social system. <br /> <br />I grew up listening to Tool since elementry school and it has been far more rewarding than damaging. His music inspires me and enhances my creativity in contrast to that monotonous mainstream garbage. In fact, I don't think I know any cases in my local area where people listening to Tool lead them to satanism or any of the other things you mentioned. Granted their work is heavily influenced by drugs (like alot of other musicians and artists in general), some people think they need them to really push the enevelope of creativity. Personally, their music helps me expand my mind and creativity without the use of drugs which is why I think its great. Regardless, you are basically making completely unbacked claims and you really need to show some properly documented and controlled statistical research before you can make absolute claims like that. I am not saying it absolutely doesn't effect people in a negative way, but from what I have seen, on average, it didn't make me or any of my friends any worse off than before. I am personally not religious (yes, even before I listened to Tool), but I have no issues with religous people unless they start saying nonsensical stuff that just de-educates the minds of people and attempts to regress/slow the evolution of the human race. <br /> <br />--- <br /> <br/>Anyhow, as a review this is a great CD. Its kinda like Pink Floyd meets metal... but thats just may way of looking at it :P <br /> <br />Actually have had this CD for a while and listened to it for about 10 years, but wrote a when I saw that rediculous religious person's review. <br /> <br />Great music, love his new stuff and A Perfect Circle too (except for that cover CD). Can't wait until the new CD comes out, def going to get that!
B000002TQV|5.0|I really like Radiohead and I owned OK Computer and wanted to buy another Radiohead CD and I saw the great reviews this CD got but I was skeptical not having heard of any songs prior to my purchase. But I was pleasantly surprised to how great this CD is. I absolutley love it, even more than OK Computer. Every song is great, nothing to skip over. If you like coldplay or radiohead and you dont own this I higly recommend it. Has a great mellow sound, I love his voice, just overall perfect.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|I really liked the movie.  I swear, I did.  However, I absolutely hated Gerard Butler's voice as the Phantom.  He acted it well, but his voice was absolutely horrific!  Especially after such a wonderful singer like Michael Crawford.  So...if you are looking for a good movie, go ahead and see it, but do not hold too high expectations for Butler's voice.
B00000K31Q|5.0|This movie is a wonderful movie. It has some really good things to keep in mind when you personally are going through high school and if you have already been there is reminds you of how you were in high school. How there will always be those jocks, the smart kids and the outsiders but you make it the experience you want. A true classic in my books.
020530902X|5.0|Elements of Style is a classic for anyone who writes professionally.  I remember using it as a text book supplement in high school, and that book was 20 years old at the time.<br /><br />Very good book to have.

B0009TRRN0|1.0|This presentation is muddy and not worthy of the DVD format and is unfortunately not authorized, which is why the transfer and print are of such subpar quality.

B000002JK2|4.0|I first picked up this in album form in the mid 80s.  Being a big fan of The Who and Pete Townshend I thought I would give it a try.  I was definitely not disappointed and am thrilled to now find it on cd.  <br />If you are looking for a Who \\"album\\" this is NOT it.  This resembles more closely Pete's Scoop albums.  However, if you want a pleasant mixture of music lyrically and instrumentally you should truly enjoy this. There is something for most music lovers on this.  Buy it, try it, love it.
0375805613|5.0|I loved this book when I was a kid--it's one of the first I can remember reading on my own. I had the Little Golden Books version, and I read it (or had it read to me) so many times, that in my first clear memories of it, it was already in tatters (real tatters, not just the drawn-on ones in the artwork). It's great to see it in now a sturdy board-book version, and I look forward to reading it to my little one.
0684824906|5.0|If you are interested in the politics of leadership, this is a must read. Doris Kearns Goodwin's methodology of presenting several different individual's point of view to a single incident, event or public mood, using their own written word, is genius and gives the reader an excellent sense of the times. This book is a treasure and would likely make a celebrated motion picture.
0375507256|3.0|I won't get into detail describing the book, just see the many fine reviews below. <br /> <br />I enjoyed this book very much.  This writer has an excellent ability to cross many genres and do it as if he were a true master of each one.  Each story is a page turner in and of itself.  In fact, the only real criticism I have is that at many times, I enjoyed the plot so much that I would have loved to have seen each story played out in full at great length.  Jumping from one to another became somewhat annoying because it always seemed to happen when I was really getting into the moment.  It also made it difficult to keep the characters and plots fresh in the mind when eventually you return to a story after abandoning it for a hundred pages.  In my opinion, it wasn't really needed.  I did however, like the theme that was just beneath the surface on all of the stories. <br /> <br />My favs were the island stories (both the ancient and future) and also the Brand New World-esque story followed by the retirement home incarceration.  The arrogant composer and the powerplant espionage stories were a bit hokey and sometimes dull. <br /> <br />But definitely a very entertaining read.

1563890119|4.0|A friend of mine had his Sandman collection, so I could start from number 1, then 2,3,4,5,6,7,8, then 10 (It was not complete) then 9 (When we discover that miracles in internet do happen ;-) especially if amazon is in charge) <br /> This was the beginning. Everything is not perfect, everything is not what you would expect, if you have read the rest of the saga. Although, there are a couple of moments (24 hours and the hell contest) that make this comic book a worthy addition to your own Sandman collection.
0060005688|5.0|This is a great book about how we make choices and the possible drawbacks when we have too many before us.  It's main emphasis is the psychology of choosing.  Schwartz writes clearly and gives pleanty of examples to illustrate his arguments.  I thought The Paradox of Choice was going to focus more on Marketing and how buisnesses decide what products to release.  This said, it is still immensly helpful in understanding how we make decisions, which it seems the marketers are well aware of.
B00005JKTF|1.0|I found this movie when flipping channels at home; and even though I did not see it from the beginning, I was hooked til the finish.  The story was intriguing, but not to the point where I couldn't keep up and understand what was going on.  The ending was not predictable in my opinion, which was good.     <br /> <br />Cate Blanchett was unbelievably beautiful and captivating all the way through the movie, and I think I would have enjoyed it whether I kept up with the story line or not.   <br /> <br />I recommend the movie to anyone who enjoys war stores, love stories and great acting.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|Death Cab for Cutie's Plans is an important album in their career in two ways: the first being that it is their first album on a major label and its the first album they have released since Gibbard finished his work with his side project, The Postal Service. The first plus that this CD has to offer is that long time DCfC fans will not be disappointed, the record label changed but the music did not. The band is simply doing the same type of music that they did before, they have not sold out and gone commercial to appeal to the masses. The band produces solid, deep and mature music that washes over the listener over and over again. Gibbard's lyrics are as powerful as ever. His rhyming differs from the norm and the images he evokes are extremely powerful (my personal favorite being on the first cut where he wishes to open his mouth wide enough for a marching band to march out and call out the name of a far away loved one). The lyrics stand alone as poetry without the music, and the music justly complements the beautiful words Gibbard has written. As a follow up from the Postal Service, much of the musical writing relies far more on intricate interwoven textures than it does on swelling guitar chords. Sometimes the music even takes on the persona of Postal Service-esque electro-pop. The most song that has this element the strongest is \\"Soul Meets Body.\\" It's quite interesting to hear a electronica inspired groove played on live instruments with a band. The best of many worlds have been incorporated with this album making another very strong release for Death Cab for Cutie.

0807219533|5.0|I bought this book on a gamble, and I'm certainly glad I did. This, along with it's two sequels have become firm favourites, and been listened to many times.  <br />The amulet of Samarkand, the first in the trilogy, is original both in it's ideas, and it's style. The story is told not only from multiple view points, but also in a mixture of the first and third person. The story follows Nathaniel, the boy magician in training, and Bartimaeus, the djinny who is forced against his will to do Nathaniel's bidding. Right from the beginning, the author shows a real talent for creating original and complex characters, and for superb use of language and dialogue. Bartimaeus's page time is a sheer delight. His dry, sardonic opinions, digressions to various periods in history, not to mention his sheer big-headedness make for laugh out loud reading. From the fantastic opening chapter onwards, the book is compulsive reading. Filled with action, government intrigue, murder, and of course, the delightful observations of the long-suffering Bartimaeus. A must read for all ages. <br />Simon Jones does a splendid job as narrator. These books really could have been written with him in mind. His portrayal of Bartimaeus is particularly excellent. A delightful listening experience.  <br />
0143058525|5.0|With this book, Elizabeth Gilbert shares her search for pleasure, divinity, and balance in a truly inspirational set of tales.   <br /> <br />With a grand set of characters and amazing world locations, she lays out an intimate and personal account of her journey toward growth and life fulfillment. <br /> <br />I found myself pulled into her life and feeling privileged to be there.  I think I learned as much about myself as I did about her.   That is truly the mark of a great writer; and a great book. <br /> <br />All of this is even more touching as she narrates her own story.  It is one thing to read her words on paper. It is another experience all together to hear her words spoken aloud.   <br /> <br />A personal and inspiring experience.  Thank you, Ms Gilbert, I enjoyed every momento.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|I watched this film yesterday night alone in my home. It reminded me of my idea of myself probably being a victim of some superhuman power that controls my life. I'm the creator of Superultramodern Science (SS) / Philosophy(SP) and the inventor of the NSTP (Non - Spatial Thinking Process) theory. The theory, sometimes in conjunction with some other ideas in SS, implies that (probably) space is a form of illusion to non-spatial mind, and the human beings, including everything apparently conscious, I see, and I ever saw and shall see, around could simply be zombies, i.e. mere spatial images with no corresponding states of consciousness. My life is therefore a game which shall end in my death at some age (hopefully because of old age). However, to avoid that sort of end I must change the nature of the game, the design of my life, by controlling my states of consciousness. And the way to do this might be meditation. While  watching the film I really thought that `saw is life...'. (However, it doesn't really make much sense to tell you this because if, by chance, you are conscious you would know that I'm wrong and if you are not conscious then there is no point in telling my ideas to a zombie as s/he is just a spatial image with no possibility of understanding anything. But still what if we all are conscious and victims!) Anyways do see the film!!!

B00003CXA4|4.0|The DVD release of Ghandi (20th Anniversary) has made the film look better than ever. The sound quality is excellent and the transfer is very sharp. <br /> <br />Only downside is that there is no commentary but there is a very insightful interview with Ben Kingsley (Ghandi)who talks about how he prepared for and made the film. I found particulary interesting was his thoughts about how the funeral scene was filmed. <br /> <br />There are no computer special effects in this film so it is every bit the 'epic'
B000BMSTMS|1.0|Well many things could have come from Head leaving Korn, Munky could have studied the art of guitaring and actually learned how to play killer riffs and *gasps* maybe solo. John Davis could have matured and written better songs. Bass player, I dont care that much to remember, could have learned to play like the bass player he idolizes, Flea from RHCP. The drummer could have stepped up the entecity. <br /> <br />But instead of going forward and becoming a respectable metal band, they turned to pop music producers, The Matrix. NO!!(While hitting them with rolled up newspaper) Im only a passive nu-metal fan, only few interest me and many don't have talent at all. When you hear the songs you definately hear that they don't have it anymore and are only there until their contract expires. They still have the teenage angst that only got them so far in the industry. Hell, many loyal Korn fans I know quickly returned their albums and got some money back because they were let down. Now you see why critics have always dissed korn, because they have no staying power. Enjoy this album because I sure didn't.
B00006EXL5|5.0|what if i said that the sex pistols were absolute [worthless] and they are a disgrace to the world of rock and all that is holy?!  i must say, i took it incredibly personally when you so blatantly stated how crappy mcr was and how badly they sucked........they're one of my absolute favorite bands, and it hurts to hear things like that.  You didn't even say, \\"I think...\\" or \\"In my opinion...\\", you just said \\"this is junk\\".......until scientific theory proves that my chemical romance is JUNK, you need to re-phrase your words next time.  I think My Chemical Romance is an incredible band with deep, meaninful lyrics and amazing musicianship.  If you aren't a fan, then that is your prerogative, but please don't go ranting about how bad the band is and how they could never compare to your beloved sex pistols.  Although i don't have anything against the sex pistols, or probably any other bands that you find rock-worthy, i am sure someone out there truly dislikes their music - and i'm sure you would feel offended if you heard someone putting your favorite band down.  So please, next time, keep your harsh words to yourself - most people reading your review are probably fans of the band buying a cd, so think about that.
0688156819|2.0|I am a huge fan of Tim Burton...always have been. However, I'm writing a review for others and not for me so I am going to try and look at this product from the eyes of someone unfamiliar with Tim Burton. It is definately a collector's item! The artwork is beautiful and the stories are wonderful as well! Yet the poetry is metrically \\"out-of-rythm\\" at times and all the stories seem to follow the same pattern (parents have sex, a misfit child is born, they dispise it and the family is ruined, then a tragic event settles everyone's problems). And don't think that because it's a children's book that it does not focus on the sexual aspect of this pattern...because it does. I did not word that first step for humour. It is a beautiful book and I have no regret from my purchase! But I do not think it is worth 20$ for the quality...it is very short, and seems kind of sloppy. I wouldn't be surprised to hear Burton wrote this in one night. Here is an example of the 'quality' (this is an entire story, not an abreviated example):<br /><br />Jimmy, the Hideous Penguin Boy<br /><br />\\"My name is Jimmy,<br /><br />but my friends just call me<br /><br />the hideous penguin boy\\"<br /><br />And that's the entire story...

So much of what conventional wisdom teaches us about how to treat children didn't sit well with me but I didn't have the depth of understanding of WHY it was wrong. Now I can follow my heart and my head knows it's the right thing to do. Life has gotten so much EASIER since I stopped trying to control my children all the time.
B0000035E7|5.0|Recorded for $600 and change in Seattle, Bleach is unpolished, raw and unrefined. This is in stark contrast to Nirvana's other two studio albums (the mega-hit Nevermind and the hate-fest that is In Utero), which were backed by Geffen Records, creating extremely polished sounds. Bleach succeeds where Nirvana's other two albums fail miserably: bringing out the grunge-y, punk rock feel that was Seattle's music scene of the late 80s/early 90s. The lack of polish gives the album a sincerity and a visceral feel that is lost when hearing \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\\" \\"Polly,\\" \\"Radio Friendly Unit Shifter,\\" \\"Rape Me\\" and the like. While the lyrics in the later Nirvana songs are darker and more depressing, the music hardly echoes this sentiment. On Bleach, as Kurt (or Kurdt, as it is spelled on the album's back) screams \\"Won't you believe it, it's just my luck...no recess!\\" on \\"School,\\" you feel his disgust and anger about school. Not only that, but the song transports you back to sitting in class, staring at the clock, waiting for the teacher to shut the f*ck up. Each of the 13 songs on Bleach connect through the hard hitting, raw guitar solos, thumping bass, and pounding drums. The music FEELS like the lyrics. In particular, \\"Love Buzz\\" stands out with its serpentine guitar, repeating bass line, and ever present crash of drums. As Kurt drawls out the lyrics, as if inebriated (i.e. Love Buzz), the guitar goes up and down the scale, echoing what it is he's singing about. Nirvana's best work by far, due to the intimacy that comes with listening to a few desperate, broke musicians playing for their chance at the big time. Standout tracks are Blew, Love Buzz, School, and Mr. Moustache.

B0001MDP3G|3.0|The Cons:   Perhaps the biggest problem with this film: editing. This film could have been about at least a half an hour less in duration.  The first forty to fifty minutes of the movie are a bit lethargic and not essential in terms of building the relationship between Ada and Inman. I tend to concur with the reviewer who said that she contemplated turning it off during this time. Some of this time could have been better spent developing the two main characters. This lack of development is confounding considering that is the crux of the entire story. Their \\"love\\" seems to be a little wooden, put together like a quick science project, and you would think for a movie that is two and a half hours they could have done a more decent job intertwining this into Inman leaving for the war. Although the two lovers seem to be inspired by each other, there is nothing that suggests they should, considering they barely know each other. However, alas, the movie does improve.     The Pros:   The latter half of the film, which entails Inman's attempted return home and Ada's dealings with her homeland, definitely are worth the ride. Inman continually keeps his survival in tact with the sole thought of one day seeing Ada, and Ada, despite many of the townspeople's beliefs that Inman is dead, wants to hope that he will one day return to her. Ada does not know whether to belief in the sign that she sees in the well of Inman's return.     Renee Zellweger does a commendable job as Ruby. She brings a breath of fresh air to this movie, and comes just in time to the slow start. Not only this, but she really is the basis for Ada's character to gain strength in hopes of seeing her lost love come home. Ruby and Ada are complete opposites, and yet, by the end of the film, you realize how critical they were to one another's physical and mental survival.     Overall:   One of the more prevalent themes of the film is the importance of hope and faith in times of crisis. Every major character has tobelieve that things will improve at some point, and has to do this when something in their life has become a struggle. With Ruby it is her life with her father that she attempts to comes to terms with. As far as Ada and Inman, they must learn to go on living and existing despite the possibility of never seeing one another. The true testament asserted within the film is overcoming and enduring in life's trials.     Rating: 3  stars
6305718954|2.0|The characters were uninspired, the story was full of holes (why didn't Patricia's mother become possessed since she first obtained the rosary?), and the ending felt really rushed. Despite a few good, scary posession scenes, this is an overall boring film.
B000286RNY|3.0|Enjoyable,funny movie. It's a real kick! <br /> <br />Matt <br />Queens, N.Y.
B000006TRV|5.0|The wall is one of the best albums ever made and ranks amongst the greatest rock operas along with TOMMY and QUADROPHENIA.The songs are brilliant especially RUN LIKE HELL,ANOTHER BRICK IN THE WALL and COMFORTABLY NUMB.highly recommended for your cd collection.

0793518326|5.0|Awesome book.  I am a hobbist guitar player and enjoy The Beatles music - great for anyone.  You might need reading glasses if your eyes aren't young anymore though - the print is small.
0671027387|2.0|The concept of the book would work fine, if a few more editorial passes had been done. There are many instances of stilted writing structure and other basic writing mistakes. The book was something of an ordeal to read, it didn't have the smooth reading flow that Dan Brown's other books have. Perhaps it was rushed to the printer's to capitalize on the author's fame?
0743454529|5.0|Wow what a great book!  I can't believe the twist at the end.  You will never see it coming.  This was the first book we chose for our Girl's Night Book Club and it was a hit!
B000A7Q2DM|1.0|Like so many other customers, I've found this CD will not play on my computer, even though I have a brand-new Gateway running Windows XP and the newest version of Windows Media Player. <br />This is atrocious. This sort of copy protection needs to stop. Because I bought the CD used, I can't take it back to a store.  Don't make the same mistake I did.  <br />:-(  <br />f*** copy protection <br />peace
B000002KYH|4.0|one of the few artists which you should seriously consider to have a live-cd is for sure Rod, he does not sing the songs in the same way that they are recorded on the albums, he puts something special in everyone of their performances, so you'll get a diferent idea of the songs you like the most when you hear Rod adding some salt and pepper, and maybe chili to them. <br />Don't forget this is a completely liverecorded album! <br />The reason that I don't put five stars to this album is becuase they took it off the wonderful song guess I'll always love you, which I think is a crime. <br />
0060526491|4.0|\\"The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy and Other Stories\\" is a collection of 23 poems written and superbly illustrated by Tim Burton - the director of, amongst other things - \\"Sleepy Hollow\\", \\"Beetlejuice\\" and \\"The Corpse Bride\\". It features a number of characters such as Oyster Boy (obviously, I guess), The Girl With Many Eyes, Stain Boy and Anchor Baby. For the most part, the poems are very short - many are only a few lines long, while \\"The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy\\" is pretty much the longest in the collection. There are a few others - like \\"Robot Boy\\", \\"Anchor Baby\\" and (my favourite) \\"Mummy Boy\\" - that make it past a couple of pages.     There's a pretty gruesome thread running though the book, plenty of strangeness and a smattering of sad and / or lonely characters. While I wouldn't describe it as scary, I wouldn't neceaasrily recommend reading it while eating cheese just before going to bed ! Fans of Burton's films - especially \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" - should enjoy this.
B00005OWEG|5.0|This was a gift to someone and they like it very much.
B0002XVSRE|3.0|Fast Cars is the greatest song of ALL TIME! It's better than Amazing Grace, Stairway to Heaven and Foggy Mountain Breakdown all put together times a billion! <br /> <br />Sheesh give me a break. <br /> <br />It's a song similar to Elevation but Elevation is a much better song.  <br /> <br />And it's similar to Canary in a Coalmine by another Brit band.  <br /> <br />It's nothing new and not that great.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|Most of you guys for sure remember that day on july 1985 when suddenly you turned on the tv and dozens of bands played all day long their best songs for a noble and humanitarian reason. When you buy this CD remember that you are helping to save human lives in Africa, and that is worth much more than the wonderful songs that you will listen here. The best performance of all? probably Mick jagger's give me just another night, the Cars' heartbeat city, David Bowie's Heroes, Queen We are the Champions, U2's (birth to the world) bad, Tom Pettys' Refugee or Duran Duran with hall & Oates.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|A continuation of the discontunued SCIFI series \\"FIREFLY\\", Serenity neatly ties up some significant loose ends leftover from the untimely end of firefly. The special effects are great, as is the story line. Will there be a SERENITY II ?
B000059HAI|5.0|I first saw this film in the theatre in the mid 70s, about the same time that I saw Midway (in Suround Sound, which was a trip) Tora Tora Tora was by far the most detailed, realistic film EVER made about the Japanese Attack of Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7th 1941, the cartoon (or should I say video game) version titled Pearl Harbor that was released in 2001 was a joke when compared side by side with this great no digital special effects film., ask anyone who was there to compare the 2 films, ask anyone who is a historian of the tragic event, see which one they choose, for movie lovers, the dvd has a few extras, not bad at all, but could have had a few other extras included, this film deserves the best treatment possible.
B000002GBD|5.0|When I first heard the song \\"Hair of the Dog\\" it was one of those songs that I loved so much I played it over and over endlessly. Over time I grew to love all the songs just as much as the title track.  <br /> <br />This album is so well produced that even today it sounds good. Unlike so much of the \\"heavy metal\\" of the 70s that sounds today like ersatz rock music from a B-movie.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Just a really great show.  Hope to see it back on the air.
0765315246|4.0|What a thoughtful and intriguing vision of the future that Scalzi portrays!  This books really excites the imagination and was a joy to read.  My biggest complaint was that the fun ended too soon.  I haven't read much science fiction since reading the \\"Foundation\\" trilogy as a teenager, but this book has put me on the lookout for similar works, and I'll definitely add more Scalzi titles to my wish list.
B00097A5HW|5.0|por fin! otro disco solamente cantado en espanol. la musica es bella y divertida y a veces me acuerda de los ochenta pero todavia en su estilo. su voz mas bella que nunca. vale la pena
0316926345|3.0|There were many things in this book I just plain missed.  I will admit my mediocre review has something to do with my ignorance of the subject and inability to follow at times.  It seems that other reviewers are Waugh fans, which may have made this book more enjoyable.  What I'm trying to say with this review is that if you are a Waugh fan, I think you will thoroughly enjoy this book as it sounds like it is a refreshing change of pace.  If you are not a Waugh fan, make sure you have a resource (friend who has read it or Cliff's notes) that can help you along the way. <br /> <br />It is the story of a young man who falls into a peculiar relationship with another man while at college.  They have a strong, deep connection, and Charles (narrator) begins to feel part of Sebastian's family, which is exactly what Sebastian didn't want.  Eventually, Sebastian disappears and Charles loses touch with the family.  I found part two of the book more enjoyable as it talks about Charles' painting career and his relationship with Julia, Sebastian's sister. <br /> <br />I felt that the writing was wonderful at times, but dragged on quite a bit and spoke around things so much it was difficult to understand what was going on.  Which is why I'm guessing it may be helpful to have read other things by Waugh before.  I didn't find the characters particularly engaging.  Nor did I find the discussion of religion particularly enlightening or thoughtful.  It was a fairly interesting read, but after I finished I was left wondering what I really got out of the book and I was left with very little. <br /> <br />
B000001IPL|4.0|Actually 4.5 stars <br />Every band goes through a creative peak at one time or another.  The Offspring had their moment with this album.  This is easily one of the best punk albums of the 90's along with Greenday's Dookie, and maybe even Rancid's, ...And Out Come the Wolves.  <br /> <br />Even though they use fairly easy chords and riffs, they still manage to keep things interesting.  This is an addictive and fun album.  Most of the songs on here are full of energy.  With the exception of \\"killboy powerhead\\" which if you look on the inside sleeve is not even written by them but by some band called the didbits.  Why they would choose to cover such a bad song puzzles me, but forget about this one track, it's meaningless to the rest of the album.   <br /> <br />This album still sounds fresh after over 10 years since its initial release.  Highlights include \\"Genocide\\", \\"Gotta get Away\\", \\"Smash\\", \\"Bad Habit\\", and of course \\"Come out and play\\", and \\"Self Esteem\\" (This bassline is a killer).   <br /> <br />I grew up listening to this album, and I can picture most of modern youth catching on quite easily.  The Offspring's biggest flaw is that they tried copying all the tricks and hooks from this album and making it into their permanent formula.  Americana is the only other record by them that I think can come close to the intensity of this record.   <br /> <br />If you want to introduce yourself to modern punk rock this is the one of the albums you definitely need to start off with. <br />\\"Till next time, ta ta.\\"
0060899190|4.0|I great idea and very interesting reading.  You are touched by the \\"soul\\" of those who contributed post cards.
B000002UWF|5.0|this record has surpassed my expectations, Louis Prima has without any doubts strongly influenced many popular singers such as lou bega...the sound tracks are of impressive quality! it definitely deserves two thumbs up!!
0684824906|4.0|I listened to the audio version of the book,  and while I agree with my fellow reviewers that it is very well done,  I found it difficult to keep the multiple characters straight in my head.  I kept getting Salmon (Chase) confused with Seward and Seward confused with Stanton.  Perhaps seeing the names in print would help to keep them straight.<br /><br />Richard \\"John Boy Walton\\" Thomas does a marvelous job of reading it.
034544678X|5.0|A must have for all people with dogs.  The Other End of the Leash provides valuable insight into how to create the best possible relationship between you and your dog.  It explains why our dogs react they way they do to our behavior and explains how to change YOUR behavior to communicate more effectively with your dog. <br /> <br />It is not a training manual, but more a human- dog translation guide.  Great book!  You and your dog will be grateful you read it!
B00003CXA2|5.0|i can't believe that people would rate this movie badly. but then again to each their own. some call it bad acting, too warmhearted, typical hollywood drivel. i personally don't know how anyone can watch this movie and not feel something. i love this movie each and every time i see it.
1580086810|5.0|What a great book.  The photographs are eye-catching, and the stories are riveting.  It represents the diversity of human consumption, its cost and how people choose to nourish themselves in different cultures.  One of my favorites.
B000BBOUU4|5.0|I love this movie. The original movie \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" was okay, but not the greatest. Even though this movie didn't stick to the whole entire plot of the movie it's still good. It's more modern and it gives you a background of Willy Wonka. You don't even have to be a Tim Burton fan to like this movie. I'm not a really big fan of him, yet i still loved this movie. The songs are better, the oompa loompa's are better. This movie is just all around terrific.
B000BNX3B4|2.0|You know how you know the actors are really trying and the screenwriter are really trying?? The lines are almost funny and the actors almost appealing??  There are actors you like and you want them to be good?? I wanted to enjoy this movie because so many good people were trying so hard--but--I could not wring a moment of enjoyment out of this film.  It was flat.  Lacked spark. Stick a fork in it--it's done!!
B000268QB2|5.0|Everytime I hear it playing, I get all excited and instantaneously sing.
B00005JM0B|5.0|I love the movie.  It's a well-made sci-fi/action movie.  It was well cast (Arnold was perfect as the terminator as always) and well acted.  It was very entertaining and exciting - not a dull moment.  The story is similar to the first two terminator movies of course, but as a continuation was gripping and masterfully done.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|We got this cd for my daughter who loves it, however my wife and I also like it very much.  The music is a little on the suspenseful side, but that is how the movie was.  A good listen!
0736063684|5.0|The book is outstanding in its details.<br />It is, in my opinion, second-to-non in its graphic imaging and details.<br />However it seems to me that the greater value from<br />this book will be for those who learned anatomy and<br />have previous knowledge about the human body.
076790592X|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie is an incredible book about how everything in life matters: An old professor - Morrie - knows that he will be dying, but instead of pitying himself, he is sharing everything that is important to him until the last minute. He talks with a former student about different themes of life and how he approaches them. Sharing his knowledge makes a huge difference in many people's lives. It is very touching to see how your mindset can shift everything.    The book reminded me of [[ASIN:0071601082 Working on Yourself Doesn't Work: The 3 Simple Ideas That Will Instantaneously Transform Your Life]] by Ariel and Shya Kane.  This is a great book that also outlines the importance of sharing yourself and going for your life with totality and excellence, but without trying to fix yourself. I know it sounds like a paradox, but this book gives you the guidelines for having a magnificent life, day in and day out. I highly recommend both books!
B000002U82|1.0|You know, I am an open minded person when it comes to music.  I listen to it all, with the exception of new, sanitized country and rock.  I have written essays in college on rock and roll.  I think I know good music, I can appreciate classic music, and the impact it was on what  we have now.  I also appreciate the ability some people have of seeing on different planes, and different dimensions, not literally, but you know what I mean.  But, for the life of me, I don't get this band.  How the hell this album sold 40 million units, is beyond me.  I guess the only rational explanation, is that 23 years ago, it sold to the young, teenage/college male demographic.  They liked to smoke pot or trip acid and listen to this, that's cool, I can respect that.  And i guess over time, word of mouth spread about this album.  There is the whole thing with the Wizard of OZ.  I tried that, and it was mildly interesting.  So the former potheads grow up, sell out, and then they have enough money to buy really nice toys, so they go and rebuy this album on CD.  40 million albums later, here you are.  This album's popularity reinforces the old addage, the masses are dumb, and they all buy the same dumb stuff.  So no, I don't have any mercy for this band.  They suck, stink, blow, whatever.  This is THE most overrated album of all time.  No ifs, ands, buts, or anything, this is the worst one.  I would listen to Billy Squire before I allowed this manure to bounce around in my head.  The only song worth a damn is Money, and I listen to it once every two years.  So please, if you read this far into my review, you have two options, buy this album, and join the cult, or go and search some good music, because trust me, its out there.  Don't give these rich, untalented asses any more money.  They have their spot reserved in hell for making this music.  And calling it music is the most generous thing I have to say about it.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" by Jane Austen has always been one of my favorite books.  So when I heard that they were going to make a new movie version, I was both worried and excited.  I ended up being extremely pleased with the casting and the movie.<br /><br />Keira Knightley does a wonderful job.  I remember hearing that they weren't sure whether they'd have her as Elizabeth because she was too pretty for the role, and that would have been a tragedy, b/c she's perfect in this.  As for her co-star Matthew Macfadyen who **IS** Mr. Darcy- I'm practically speechless.  I hated him at the beginning but throughout the movie I found myself falling in love with him!<br /><br />It's a lovely story, and Emma Thompson's version of it is something that I will never forget.  I recommend it to all!
0786852550|5.0|The Amulet of Samarkand is an original, wholly entertaining fantasy novel that takes the reader to places that even I didn't expect.  The first volume in the Bartimaeus trilogy is told from two different perspectives.  Firstly, the perspective of Bartimaeus, an age-old demon who has been summoned by a young magician, and given the task of stealing the Amulet of Samarkand.  The other perspective is that of the magician, or Nathaniel, also known by his magician name, John Mandrake.  Bartimaeus succeeds in stealing the amulet from Simon Lovelace, an evil, power-hungry magician who humiliated Nathaniel in a previous meeting to which Nathaniel swore revenge.  Once Bartimaeus gets hold of the amulet, pretty much everything goes wrong, which results in Nathaniel and Bartimaeus having to grudginly work together to uncover the plot of Simon Lovelace.  The amulet is a very powerful magical instrument, and Nathaniel believes that Lovelace is trying to overtake the government of London, which is run completely by magicians.<br /><br />Everything about this book is great.  Bartimaeus is a hilarious character (I love the footnotes), and Nathaniel is a good, normal protagonist who you genuinely root for.  The action is really cool, and completely original.  The book is at its best when the climax hits.  Stroud's descriptions of the different magical entities and their effects on the surroundings are amazing, stirring, and sometimes unsettling.  With this novel, Stroud has created a whole different world for the reader to immerse themselves in, and I can't wait to jump into the next book.
B000AQBA1W|5.0|This album makes it clear that Andrea Corr does indeed possess a heavenly voice. All the songs are superb, but by all means get the version (probably from Japan) that has \\"Return To Fingal.\\"  It is one of their best instrumentals ever. Other highlights? \\"Peggy Gordon,\\" \\"Black is the Colour,\\" and the two songs sung in Gaelic. You may be playing this album non-stop for weeks, it is that good.
B00005JO04|2.0|To be quite honest I was bored-to-distraction with this movie. With the exception of the Arab actors everyone else could have narrated their lines off camera and nothing would be lost. Clooney looked and acted like he was on dope and if all real spy's are that boring, no wonder we have to invent 007. The plots and sub plots were not that earth-shattering. So many things that happened could not be explained. The swimimg pool scene should have ended up on the editing room floor. And who could not guess the ending. We as Americans who can think at all know how evil all governments are and can see the writing on the wall. But this movie did nothing to push the pen further down the page of knowledge. At least \\"The Three Kings\\" made you raise your eyebrows and think. Syriana had nothing to say and the audio part was very hard to hear, Clooney talking into his beard, yet!! I gave this flik ** stars and that was for the few actors who stood-out,and the cinematography ciao yaaah69
B000E1155E|1.0|This is, no questions asked, the most overrated album of 2006.  But I'm glad I heard the album, because now I can truthfully say that the Arctic Monkeys explosively stink.  I knew they couldn't be that good because none of the mebers collaborated with Britney.  As we all know, in this business, you have to be just as good, if not better, than Britney to make it as a rock star.  But these guys have a LONG way to go if they want to be as good as her.  Having said that, wait for Britney's new album, and leave these Monkeys alone.
B0000A118M|5.0|Any critic that sits down and attempts to name the ten most influencial artists of America would have to stumble upon John Coltrane.<br /><br />Working with big names for years before being recognized, John Coltrane was eventually called by Miles Davis to help with a recording. That recording (\\"Kind of Blue\\") could be discussed until Kingdom Come, but most know that nearly all musicians involved with it went on to do great things.<br /><br />Coltrane was very popular before this 1964 release, but until \\"A Love Supreme\\" he hadn't connected, come to terms, with his spiritual side through his music. Battling through depression (brough on by drugs more than likely), he looked towards his religious roots growing up in North Carolina to record this album.<br /><br />The opening bass line is one of the most recognizable in any music to date. \\"Acknowledgement\\" is an ode to (the Christian) God, but many claim that \\"Allah Supreme\\" is chanted as a look back to a previous time when he came into contact with Islam.<br /><br />Regardless of any of that, \\"A Love Supreme\\" is one of the most well known jazz recordings of all time. Some regard Coltrane as thee definitive jazz musician and one of the best musicians ever. After all these years this album still holds up. It's spiritual, it's uplifting (one \\"verse\\" consists of a poem \\"spoken\\" through John's sax!), and at times catchy. It's accessible for those looking to get into jazz, but even those who have memorized every  note and improvisation still find much to discuss.<br /><br />A must for any jazz collection.
B000089RVX|1.0|This has to be without a doubt one of the worst bands i have ever heard.<br /><br />Her voice is terrible plus she just drones on and on until you become clinically depressed. And then that guy comes in and starts rapping and it sounds like linkin park. Every single song sounds exactly the same. The lyrics are horrible too. Gore metal lyrics have more variation than hers. Why does she sound so depressed all the time. What does she have to be depressed about? Nothing. The music is just as bad as the lyrics and vocals. The guitars are dreadfull. They are tuned way down so that they have no definition. If you have any self respect do not by this abomination.
B00004RF9B|4.0|Considering the year that this movie was filmed, the special effects are very sophisticated, and the story interesting.  It is fun to compare the space exploration in this movie to what is going on today.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Here's some awesome random info for you: <br /> <br />- she further strengthened her record of being the female with most No. 1 singles in UK history. <br /> <br />- She's the female with most weeks at the top, this being her 25th week. <br /> <br />- She also just edged further over Kylie Minogue being the female with the longest span between #1 hits: Before \\"Sorry\\", she was pushing on 20 Years, 3 Months and 30 Days (1060 weeks) between \\"Into The Groove\\" (August 85) to \\"Hung Up\\" (November 05).

B00005T7I1|5.0|You've got to own this movie. It is stripped from the comic strips from the funny pages and brought directly to you. In this adventure, not only does tracy have to figure a way to balance his work and love life but he's trying not to get a desk job, fight a growing mob of all the misfits he's taken down countless times before, and even had time to take in a small homeless boy. It's a busy day in the city of lights. Al Pacino also plays a pivital role in this feature. What this movie is is classic flim noir city. Sin City would go along great with this movie and you could have a film noir marathon in your own entertainment center. Enjoy!
B00005JMAH|4.0|An engaging film, the third harry potter movie does the best job of introducing new fans to the magical world of harry potter. It has to, for time, cut out some of the better parts of the story (such as the fact that harry's father and his friends were animagi and \\"moony, wormtail, padfoot and prongs\\" and the reason for snape's hatred of james and harry potter).  despite these omissions, the film does a better job of showing the humanity of harry and of enhancing the darker nature of this film.  As someone who did not originally read the books, this film actually interested me enough to find and read all of the harry potter books and beome a fan myself.
B00005JMXX|2.0|I'm sorry. I just couldn't get into this movie. But, just to please the masses, I watched it the whole way through. I admit that the sepcial effects were great but I have got to tell you something: CGI and WOLVES do not go together. Not in my book. If you wanna present danger than get real wolves. Don't toy with my emotions. Also, it's kind of hard to believe that the scientist would plead to death about dealing with the situation and no one listens. Believe me, after all the things that the earth goes through you'd think that someone would listen. Anyway, That's what I have to grip about.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|From an early age I have been a fan of Animal House, since my parents were big fans.  In fact, I cannot remember the first time I saw it, I have seen them so many times.  Bizarre and over the top, Animal House is a hilarious portrayal of losers at an 1960s college, joining a frat and seeking revenge against the administration.  By far, the best part of the movie is John Belushi, whose character Bluto is so over-the-top that you cannot fail to laugh at every scene he is in.  Animal House is truly a must-see for anyone over the age of 14, a bit raunchy but suitable for most teens.  BUY IT!
B00014NE62|5.0|This is a most beautiful movie. I can`t imagine anyone not enjoying it. The two disc package is brilliant and I will be heirlooming mine to stay in the family long after I have gone.
B000BM6AVA|3.0|Enjoyable, but not as good as Mesmerize.  They should have sold it as a 2 disc set.
B00012L786|5.0|I usually tell people who wonder about Film Noir to see Out Of The Past.  Pickup On South Street didn't change my opinion but its still very good.<br /><br />This time, Richard Widmark skirts the line between the psycho he played in earlier films and the good guy he would become.  This seems just right because it gives him the dangerous edge he needs.  The movie is tough and politically incorrect but like the anti-Commie business, a product of its time.<br /><br />No need to say more.  Performances are great as are scenes of a New York long gone.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|One of the best new bands out there based on this album.  I liked it a lot.
B000BNX3AU|4.0|In many ways, \\"Must Love Dogs\\" is a standard romantic comedy.  Two recently divorced people find each other on an internet dating service.  While it is obvious to the audience that these two should be together, they suffer through a wide variety of misunderstandings and mishaps until they finally realize what we knew and get together at the end of the movie (I hope I didn't give it away.)<br /><br />This would normally rate 3 stars - an average and nice movie.  But I gave it 4 stars because of the dialog.  The writing is quick witted and many of the jokes are surprising and unexpected.  I laughed out loud many times and that bumped this movie from 3 stars to 4.
B0009RCPY8|4.0|I've loved these movies for years! I was so excited when I found out that they got put on DVD with EXTRA FEATURES like Deleted Scenes and Commentary which I love! I just wish that there were Deleted Scenes for both movies instead of just the first one, so that's why I gave it four stars instead of five.
B000063DFQ|5.0|Maiden was insanely talented.  \\"The Trooper\\" and \\"Flight of Icarus\\" stick out in my mind as two of the most ingenious metal songs in about a dozen that I love so much.  Bruce Dickenson is a brilliant musician as are all the members of Maiden and I can't thank this band enough for all the years of brilliant metal they have made for me.  Thank you.
B000055Y0Y|5.0|From an acting standpoint, IN THE LINE OF FIRE is one of Clint Eastwood's best performances; it was right about this time that Clint decided that he couldn't play the young hero anymore; but for a guy in his fifties, he does pretty well.  He plays Frank Horrigan, a Secret Service agent, who was unable to prevent the assassination of John F. Kennedy; some twenty years later, he finds himself facing a formidable assassin in Mitch Healey, an intelligent, cold blooded killer who has told Horrigan he's going to kill the current President.<br /><br />Clint is very well supported by Rene Russo as his female agent for whom he falls; Dylan McDermott, his new partner, who wants to please Eastwood but has his doubts about his abilities; John Mahoney as his cagey boss; and Fred Dalton Thompson as the President's Chief of Staff.<br /><br />But it's really John Malkovich as Healy who runs the show; he's brilliant as the crazed but savvy villain, his silky voice smooth when he's in charge but savage when things don't go his way.  Malkovich earned a Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for this role and deservedly so.  One of his best performances as well.<br /><br />IN THE LINE OF FIRE is tense, superbly directed by Wolfgang Peterson, and a top notch thriller.
1400032717|4.0|Mark Haddon totally understands autism in children.  I thought I was reading a novel written by a mother who had an autistic child.  It's a very quick read and you just don't want to put it down because it's shocking how he thinks.  I found myself getting on and off the tubes thinking how would he do this--what would he count--were there any red cars in a line--this shows that the author rounded the character in a way that sticks in the reader's mind.  Worth a read if passing time on a plane, train, bus, or rainy day.
B000002U82|5.0|The dark side of the moon was amongst the most beatiful albums ever made.Each and every song has been well crafted and should be prsent in every cd collection.go for it.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I first heard \\"No Such Thing\\" being piped in over the speakers of a fast food joint. Not knowing who or what it was, I probably was more curious than anything else. After getting the album, however, I was impressed: commercial-sounding and heavy on the Major 7th chords- yes, but tasty nonetheless.  John Alagia's excellent production is certainly partially responsible for that, although it should be remembered that any CD is the work of both the artist and the recording studio.     Excited by what I heard, I then grabbed Mayer's live concert DVD, \\"Any Given Thursday.\\" What a mistake. It was so repugnant I thought I would throw up! He comes off like an unsophisticated little prig, made all the more unattractive by his embarrassing  hipster asides. What's more, he really didn't sound very good. The experience was, in fact, enough to turn me off to the guy and make me bury this CD deep in the closet, denying to friends that I had ever purchased it.    But then I heard \\"My Stupid Mouth\\" on the radio recently, and it prompted me to hook up the earphones once again. Just can't deny it: that selection and a few of the others (especially the kicker \\"Love Song for No One\\") are simply infectious. The crude antics and occasional pretentious posing Mayer displays as a live performer discredit what appears to be a fairly decent songwriter's touch which, while shrouded in mainstream pop, is effectively distinct.  As a result, the hypnotic sound that can be gleaned from ROOM FOR SQUARES will probably keep you coming back.
0380733358|4.0|This is an excellent, fast-moving thriller, and I would definitely rank it as one of the best, if not the best, of Follett's spy-genre/thriller books.  (An aside: I consider The Pillars of the Earth one of the top 10-20 books I've ever read, but it is not typical of Follet's style so I do not try to compare it to his other books).  Although the events of the book last throughout World War II, the primary focus is on the months leading up to the D-Day invasion.<br /><br />I do not want to reveal much about the plot, but the backstory is as follows: a German spy located in England learns something about the Allies' plans that could cripple the invasion, provided that the spy can personally get this information to his superiors in Germany.  The spy's journey brings him to a small island and its interesting residents...<br /><br />As is a recurring theme in Follett's novels, there are multiple protagonists, one of whom is a woman.  This is always refreshing, as the spy novel/thriller genre tends to be very male-oriented.  I realize this is vague, but I really do not want to say much more and spoil this book.<br /><br />One thing that I find particularly enjoyable about Ken Follett's thrillers is that they are managable in length.  Ken Follett comes off just as knowledgable about the era and setting of his book as the Tom Clancy's and Vince Flynn's of the world, but without the hundreds of extra pages of filler.  All told, Eye of the Needle is a great read.
B000BYRCH4|3.0|This movie is entertaining and enjoyable to watch, can't see that the actors are brilliantly but their not the worst. The two main actor/actress are Jessica Alba and Paul Walker who are a couple living their dreams on the Bahamas, the two of them are treasure hunters hoping to hit big and retire early with their millions. Everything starts to go wrong when an old Friend Scott Caan shows up with his newest girlfriend Ashley Scott, as they go treasure hunting the find a plane that is full of drugs no more said you can see were its going.  <br /> <br />Treasure, Drugs, Sharks Good Fun  <br /> <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Loved the movie on many levels.  The dialog was unique and witty that invites you to listen, really listen to what is and how it is being said.  The subtle facial expressions needed another whole script to put them in alignment.  I really enjoyed River's feet and the attention to show grace under pressure.  Joss captured the elegance and beauty of River's wanting to interact with the outside world on her terms. <br /> <br />I had not seen the series on Fox but did catch an episode on its replay on Sci-Fi recently.  My first real exposure to the Firefly saga was this movie and I went out and bought the DVD series soon after to allow me to fill in the blanks.  A real shame to see the series pass on.  The movie is labor of love and the baby is beautiful.
630463949X|4.0|i definitely recommend this product to other fleetwood fans...great live show, nice selection of songs, some songs variated from their original forms but it was nice to hear them in a new light...Some standouts from the dvd include rhiannon, dreams and silver springs...
B000007492|3.0|Hello Sorry to disappoint you all I am not a supertramp fan. Of course I do love songs like From Now On, Goodbye Stranger and Logical. However, the rest of the songs were mediocre at best. I have to say the recording and remastering of this album is so good that I almost wanted to be a Supertramp fan. One can hear the sounds of the symbals in the background and finger snaps so clearly that it feels like it is in the room. Amazing technology!!!!
0385507755|4.0|I THOUGHT THE BOOK WAS STILL GREAT EVEN AFTER ALL THE CONTROVERSY.I FEEL HIS \\"OWN\\" TRUTH IS WHAT HE WAS LIVING WHILE HE WAS LIVING IN HIS \\"OWN\\" HELL BEFORE RECOVERY.
B000BCKFWK|5.0|This version is 10 times better than the original DVD, it has many more special features, included scenes previously cut out from before (hence the title's name).  You need to buy this DVD if you liked Sin City and were unsatisfied with the first release!!
B000AWYOGE|2.0|It was OK.  But I would not consider it a quality horror movie.  The writing could have been better - I could guess the story too soon into the movie.  I will probably not watch this movie again.  I gave my copy away.  Maybe someonelse will enjoy it.
0930289528|5.0|Once again, DC Comics elevates the graphic novel to great heights!  The artwork and storyline, as well as the handsome production values, make this truly a collectible worth reading.  Especially interesting is the fact that, while written originally as a sardonic look at 1980's UK politics, it is shockingly relevant to today's global crises.<br /><br />A great read soon to be released in an impressively faithful motion picture adaptation with Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving.
B000002UAF|5.0|For all the people that feel that this album is not the \\"real\\" soundtrack to the film, let's get something straight...The Beatles did not intend this album to be just a soundtrack, this was supposed to be their full third album, even though they started it because of the film.  This is not a soundtrack album at all, but a full Beatles album in its own right, and just so happens to be one of the 3 or 4 best albums they ever made.  Every song is memorable...I'd even go so far as to say that John's songwriting was never as consistent as it was here.  But when people give a bad review becuase the album available is not the one they grew up with, I get mad because not only is this a better value, you don't have to listen to the crappy muzak that United Artists forced onto the original soundtrack album.  Embrace this version, being closed minded is keeping you from enjoying the peak of their early years.  Song for song, a masterpiece
B000C65Z1G|4.0|When I first saw this film in the theater I was left with a distinct empty feeling at the film's end.  With little or no hope for the characters I cared about, I found myself forced to leave the theater and re-enter a world that suddenly wasn't as safe and comfortable-seeming as the one I had left just a couple of hours before.  I was glad I had seen the film and felt I understood the nature of evil in the world a bit better for it, but I wasn't sure it was a movie I'd want to see again.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />Something subtle in this film stayed with me through the succeeding months, haunting me beyond the politics of the movie's compelling plot line.  It lay in the luminous relationship between Ralph Fiennes' and Rachel Weisz's characters that those actors wonderfully portray.<br /><br />Here are two people -- seemingly polar opposites -- who discover in one another a mutual respect and affirmation of life.  Just watching this fragile union between two disparate people truly work amidst all the evil that pervades the world around them is one of the most life-affirming things I can remember onscreen.  To have one's faith and principles shaken but to ultimately remain true to oneself is something rare and valuable and yet too little seen in film today.<br /><br />For me this film has slowly grown from one that I admire to one I hold as truly necessary.
B0000TG9E2|4.0|There's certain sequences in Disney films that are so memorable they tend to get parodied or they're referenced more than the actual movie. The spaghetti scene in Lady and the Tramp. Bambi's mother in that movie, or the pink elephant scene in Dumbo are examples of scenes that are just as memorable as the films. So it's odd that so many of Alice's scenes are pop culture even when it didn't have the warmest welcome on release. Granted we're not talking Disney's masterpiece level but still, it's quite a quirky movie. <br /> <br />Alice is receiving lessons when she sees the reflection of a rabbit in the water. She follows it and stumbles down a long hole and enters the world of Wonderland. She ends up seeing a long list of quirky situations including Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the Mad Hatter, Queen of Hearts, talking flowers and the White Rabbit. <br /> <br />Even though it's a film unto itself, many of its scenes are referenced in other films are they're just pop culture iconic scenes. And of course the Matrix brought it back by using the rabbit hole and white rabbit imagery. The film however didn't get the biggest response as people were confused by it and found it odd. It's even written Walt himself apologized for it although it became popular after it was on a television show edited down. <br /> <br />This is probably the most atypical film Disney's released, although other films such as Emperor's New Groove or Atlantis are quite different. While those 2 were pretty devoid of characters breaking out into song, Alice has a bunch of songs. The imagery of course is odd as we get walking pencils, talking flowers, tears turning into raging waters and a cat who has a habit of disappearing. You can obviously tell why critics couldn't understand it. It's still cited as one of Disney's more better \\"smart\\" films such as Fantasia. <br /> <br />You should check it out? Of course but word of caution: by no means are you going to see a quintessential Disney classic but still you'll probably like it and enjoy it...probably.
0307276902|4.0|This book was difficult to read. Not that it wasn't well written, I think it was, but because the things that he wrote about hit close to home. I understand that some of what was said was fabricated, but if you have lived with or around a loved one who has gone through this you could see the truth. I don't know if it is actually true for Mr. Frey, but a lot of it was true for a person close to me.
B000683VI4|5.0|This is a great movie! I really advise to buy this special edition DVD. I've enjoyed watching this movie in wide and full screen versions that this DVD holds.<br /><br />See ya.
B00097DXZS|1.0|Even Santana cannot afford to release such a deceiving record, it's not even commercial but lacks completely of soul and spirit. On the same time I bought Chavez Reavine by Ry Cooder, there you find soul. Despite it, I will probably see him and his friends on stage this year at the Montreux Jazz Festival
B00005M91K|5.0|The title means \\"The Essence of Life\\".  This is a documentary with no narrative at all, only a musical background, that is replete with gorgeous images and not so gorgeous.  Yet some scenes filled me with tears, for beauty, and for mankind's horrors.  This is an important film, one that should be viewed by all of us, and preferably on the big screen, as I feel it looses impact to have these pictures reduced.  Yet, better on DVD than not at all.
B00003CXCW|2.0|Talk, talk and then talk a little more. Never stop talking about yourself. You dont have a job, talk. You are in debt, keep talking. An old, delusional, suicidal woman's monkey dies and she keeps you as a replacement, please talk away. Even if you are DEAD, don't let that stop you from talking! <br /> <br />But this movie is not all about a man talking about his life (or his death). This movie is actually about ghosts! How the ghost of bad scripts looms over a wannabe Hollywood script writer. How the ghost of long gone stardom looms over an old silent movie actress. And how seeing that psychotic ghost of his ex-wife-cum-employer turns a director a bit crazy too. <br /> <br />So for the three ghosts we present you with three Oscars !!! <br /> <br />The movie should be named \\"How *Talking* movies KILLED me!!\\". Takies killed the silent movie starlet, and all the talking in the movie killed me! <br />
0784011176|5.0|I think Jane Campion, the director of the excellent \\"Angel at My Table\\", to be an important director, and this her finest work.  It was the first movie that I had ever seen, and lord knows I have seen thousands, that I thought of as a truly great work of art.  Up until that time, 1993, the best movie I had ever seen, and now, in 2006, I would still have to think hard to come up with a better one.  \\"The Age of Innocence\\" and \\"Chocolat\\" are not far behind.  Holly Hunter, Harvey Keitel, always mesmerizing, and New Zealand.  The score must almost be considered an additional character, it was so haunting and memorable.  This is just simply a don't miss film.  One to see over and over.  And like this year's \\"Brokeback Mountain\\", a story of repressed emotions.  In another time, and place.
0312995423|1.0|I just finished reading Dan Brown's Digital Fortress. Boy that's one bad book! If DaVinci Code was 10, this one is a 3. I have tremendous respect for Dan Brown and his works. I think he is a genius writer. But I think he didn't quite get it in his this first novel.  <br /> <br />The story is too dramatic. The whole Crypto section of NSA blowing up, a language professor running around in Spain trying to find a ring, the cat-and-mouse chase between him and his assassin ... everything is too dramatic. Which is why the plot becomes predictable. <br /> <br />Plus he doesn't talk about cryptography as much as he should have. Maybe because its a difficult concept. Explaining it to a layman reader is hard. If you try to go deep into the subject, you might loose the audience. On the other hand, explaining symbology in ancient paintings and buildings is easy. As you go deep into the subject, the readers become more fascinated. Mystery-in-the-History is a crowd puller, especially if its also controversial. <br /> <br />Digital Fortress has no mystery, no history, and no controversy (well a little controversy over NSA's job, but nothing that excites the readers). It has just drama! <br /> <br />
B000002H2Z|5.0|When this album first came out, it was a total revelation. I had been a casual fan for a few years, but never rabid. This record changed that.      I may be in the minority, and this flies in the face of convention (sorry Matt & Trey) but the Cure would never make an album this brilliant again. Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me was certainly great (well, except \\"Walking on Sunshine\\"...er, I mean \\"All I want Is You\\") And Disintegration was a great (if overly long) statement. But no other release carried such an overall broad, yet concise approach that keeps Head sounding so fresh after 21 years.

1881273156|5.0|This book is a page turner for anyone who wants to improve their communications in their marriage.  It's all the things you should know before you get married and a definite reminder of the reality of love once you are married.  I learned that not only did I not know my spouses love language, what I was speaking was my own love language and my spouse could not respond...I was talking to myself essentially.  Now that I know how to speak my spouses love language, I see immediate results.
B00005JMEW|5.0|This film is not only a martial arts movie but a thriller of human stength, thirst for revenge and the power of spirit. The typical Tarantino horrific inventions (like the episode in the hospital where Thurman has just woke up from deep coma) do not fail to surpise the viewer with their brutality. A fine film for the fans of martial arts but was really all this blood needed? The sequence of the `chapters` is excellent and going back and forth in time keeps the suspence until the last minute. An orgy of swordfight and combat to the death!
0393327655|5.0|Harris describes faith as separate from reason primarily with regard to the evidence that supports reason, while faith is belief in dogma that has no evidence to support it. But we have faith in our axioms, even arithmetic requires faith in Peano's axioms and how, after believing such axioms, can one not see everything as evidence to support the belief? Harris' mistake leads to failure to realize that what is significant is the nature of the narrative believed. A faith enables a person to see all the evidence they need to support their faith. Harris mistakes for evidence what he already believes to be true and so does not realize that the criterion of evidence will not help differentiate one faith from another -- faith in Islamic dogma, or faith in science. As a result Harris interprets the scientific narrative used by Hitler and others as their legitimating narrative as one he describes as faith instead of science.<br /><br />By recognizing the necessity of faith and reason together this mistake is averted and our attention can be instead focused on the quality of the narrative, the faith in which values can be compared to the axiomatic faith in other narratives. Which narrative, when believed, leads to the best quality of life? While the accomplishments of the various science narratives are clear in our technological benefits, we must consider all aspects of the life belief in a narrative achieves.<br /><br />This is an excellent book and reads well as well as offers many wonderful analogies that make for pleasurable reading. The inspiration for the book is clearly something shared by all and the discussion is clearly of great interest. Note also Daniel Dennett's new book \\"Breaking the Spell\\". But both books miss the importance of faith in science narratives and so miss important aspects of the human dilemma. Two books that discuss these issues better are Hilary Putnam's \\"The Collapse of the Fact/Value Dichotomy\\" and Pope Benedict XVI's \\"Truth and Tolerance.\\"
B00005JKL8|4.0|This movie was good but not very historicly accurate or in military but overall its a pretty exciting movie
B0007PAMR4|3.0|I bought this DVD expecting to see the COMPLETE version which I saw in the theater in 1984.  Instead, it is the same cut which I have on VHS, plus a lot of more or less interesting bonus material.  The so-called \\"deleted scenes\\" must have been swept up from the cutting room floor or something.  I have a pretty good memory for the original, and there was more detail to it, but the bonus scenes simply were not in the original.  You can't fool me, Dino.  I know there is a longer, more exhaustive version than this. <br /> <br />This new release is nicely packaged in a sturdy metal case.  I wish all DVD's came this way.  Maybe this is the wave of the future.  Hope so! <br /> <br />I have a preference for the DVD's from the SciFi Channel's production.  They go into much more detail, explaining many things omitted in the original, such as Princess Irulan and her role in the drama, which left out makes the movie not make sense. <br /> <br />Here's a little bit of movie history trivia.  When I went to see the original in the theater, they actually handed out \\"cheat sheets\\".  These were pieces of paper explaining the terms used in the film, such as BeneGesserit.  I guess you were supposed to have cats' eyes and be able to read by the light of the movie screen???  Anyway, first and last time I have ever been handed something to read in connection with seeing a movie! <br /> <br />If you are a cultist, which I am, this \\"extended version\\" is worth having.  Otherwise, my advice would be to save your money and wait for the REAL extended version.  Are you listening, Dino???
0060920432|3.0|The basic message of this book is that enjoyment in life is found by application to tasks which match a person's abilities, and that the complexity of the tasks needs to adapt as the person's skills develop. I make that sound like an obvious statement, and maybe it is.     I read this book through because a person I respect recommended it to me, but if she hadn't, I would have only skimmed many parts of it. The book sort of tripped over its own message, because the task it presented to me, the task of reading, became increasingly tiresome due to the repetitiousness of Csikszentmihalyi's examples.     Still, there were highlights. As an avid bicyclist, I found one passage, on pp. 60-61, that rang very true -- cited in part here.    \\"It is usual to explain the motivation of those who enjoy dangerous activities as some sort of pathological need: they are trying to exorcise a deep-seated fear, they are compensating, they are compulsively reenacting an Oedipal fixation, they are 'sensation seekers.' While such motives may be occasionally involved, what is most striking, when one actually speaks to specialists in risk, is how their enjoyment derives not from the danger itself, but from their ability to minimize it...\\"    Csikszentmihalyi gives examples of rock climbers and scuba divers, but the same observation applies to skillful bicyclists riding down steep hills or in urban traffic. What non-cyclists may regard as terrifying, skillful cyclists find to be acceptably safe and thoroughly enjoyable.     I have a couple of other discomforts with Csikszentmihalyi.     One is with the fundamental precept that merely finding appropriately challenging activities can bring enjoyment in life. This raises the question, \\"is that all there is?\\" Those of us who are motivated by duty, faith, love or wonder may want to challenge ourselves with tasks of stewardship rather than only activities that match our abilities -- though I'll grant that Csikszentmihalyi makes some important pointsabout the risks of burnout, or of falling into a rut, in political, religious, artistic and social activities as in others.    Also, I often find Csikszentmihalyi's prose style unsatisfying. His long-windedness may disturb me because I see it in myself, too: example, this review! But I also found a few outright misuses of terminology. As an engineer, I was especially annoyed by the weak, vernacular misuse of the term \\"negative feedback\\" as a synonym for \\"criticism.\\" Negative feedback is a very specific and powerful engineering concept, that of reducing distortion in a system by sending an inverted sample of the output back to be compared with the input, in a closed loop. This concept is powerful in sociological modeling as well, but only as applied to criticism which is arranged to bring results -- example: wage incentives as they affect employees' performance.    So, all in all, you may have a more optimal flow experience by just skimming Flow. Ah, glutton for punishment that I was, I read it all!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I'll keep this short, i'm not a sci-fi fan in the slightest. I don't watch any programmes which have the words Star or Space somewhere in the title and as for Star Wars, I'd rather stick hot needles dipped in chilli sauce in my eyes for two hours than give that movie the time of day. When I went to see Serenity, I had'nt heard anything about it. I was bored on my day off and there was nothing else on so I gave Serenity a shot and I was pleasently surprised. This turned out to be a cracking movie and is now the only sci-fi dvd in my collection which includes over 300 movies! So, if you are a fan of sci-fi, you are going to love this movie and if like me you are not much of a sci-fi fan, I still highly recommend you give Serenity a shot, you just might find yourself enjoying it. Lets have a sequel please!! <br />
B000BW7QX6|5.0|this movie is about what happened in the firefly series after the show got cancelled. it had a big fan base, being a show created by joss whedon the buffy and angel creator, but had an unfortunate time slot, so it didnt have a chance to build a bigger fan base.its a sci-fi drama with comic elements and western and asian themes. i know that sounds strange but joss really pulled it off. its an awesome series that gets you hooked in the first episode.the basic premise for the show(firefly, where the whole thing started)is that earth was too small for all the people so they left and traveled until they found  more planets that they could colonize. there are two big central planets that are highly advanced and civilized and then a big bunch of other planets and the farther out you go the less civilized it gets.the major influences are asian and american because joss figured we two were the biggest cultures on earth and if we ever migrated off planet there are more of us than anyone else. you do see others from time to time,the russian mafia,british etc. anyway ,there was a big battle comparable to the big north/south gettysburg thing where they were trying to decide whether to have individual governments to run all the planets or just one big one for everyone located on the central planets.the main characters in this series were on the losing side ,the side of individual governments.they were a little bitter about it and the unified government kind of doesnt care about whats happening  on the outer planets and the main characters become smugglers.they pick up some passengers in the first episode, a priest, a doctor and a few others and the story begins. the doctor is smuggling his sister away from the alliance(main government people)because they were doing experiments on her in the genius school she was going to and then the rest of the crew gets involved when they find out.the movie serenity happens when the series ended, with them finding out why the government wants her back so badly.its really cool, a little scary, and pretty funny. i highly reccomend it and its better if you see the firefly episodes first, because in the movie they dont have alot of time for character development, and all the really funny stuff is in the episodes.also, the movie was intended to be the first of a trilogy, but they wont make the next one unless it makes a certain amount of money, but it ends in a way that if you never see another one the story is semi-satisfactorily ended.
B000683VI4|5.0|The BEST movie purchase I have made this year!  A REALLY great love story!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is an Absolutely must own series. If you like Sci/Fi if you enjoy action, if a well written amusing show appeals to you - if you are breathing you MUST watch, then own this series. It is so good that it must be a miracle.  You will be amazed - this a GEM - So good you will want them to make more but be afraid that they will screw them up!!!!!!
B000001EYO|5.0|I don't own this soundtrack, but I am a huge fan of the film.  For those that feel the absence of \\"tumbling tumbleweeds\\", the recording is by \\"Riders in the Sky\\".  They tour extensively.  If I could create a volume two of this soundtrack, I would certainly include the bowling competition tape and the theme song from \\"Branded!\\"

B0000AQVCL|5.0|JET has managed to allow me to remember the good ol' days, days with rock music, from Zeppelin to the Stones, JET is all of that put in a blender, and then some. I have a hard time getting into new music, but when i listened to this album for the first time, it made me remember what it was like when i go Zeppelin II on vyinal... pure masterpiece. JET isnt like the rest of today's bands who show up, is popular, then goes away fast, i believe that JET will go on to bigger and better things, one thing for sure is, im buying every album released by them.

1892005034|5.0|This book has been a helpful companion and enjoyable and deeply moving book to read as an addition to working one to one with a certified NVC trainer. Having read lots of 'self help' books in the past to seeing councillors to analysing my own background and life, nothing has helped me. years of questioning myself and trying to change but never really making any progress leaves me relieved to have stumbled upon NVC. in the 3 short months that i have been having one to one sessions and reading NVC books my life and my interactions with others has changed considerably. NVC has made a huge difference in my life with my children, relatives, teachers of schools, work. the list goes on. When i discovered NVC I was really doubtful that anything could help me change the nature of my relationships with others and i am astonished at the depth and simplicity of NVC.
0060872675|5.0|As with all terry pratchett books enjoyable funny for all ages <br />and this is no exception just the right length to read to my 6 year old daughter and my 3 month baby son.Recommend this book to anyone with children.
B000BJS4TO|3.0|I enjoy the music,on one hand, because it brings back pictures to me of that beautiful movie.But the music itself is stirring and ,of course, Yo-Yo Ma and Itzhak Pearlman are magnificent! The music is almost my favorite part,even though some is redundant. If you enjoyed the movie,I think you would enjoy this CD
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Wow, I'm amazed this was finally released! I won't say it was \\"worth the wait\\" but it's better than I'd hoped for.<br /><br />Still, it took them 12 freakin' years to do it... I'm appalled.<br /><br />Makes me wonder how long we'll wait for The Delicate Sound of Thunder DVD...<br /><br />...and when will we get to see the complete Knebworth 1990 show? Five songs were played on the UK pay-per-view, but only two were included in the Knebworth 1990 DVD/VCR, WTF?<br /><br />And how about that Live in Venice appearance that was televised across Europe, but never aired in the U.S.?
0393035158|5.0|This book, in spite of the necessity to constantly go to the notes section, completely resonated with me.  As a scientist, I am duty bound to search for evidence to either support or reject various hypotheses.  The principles I use for my work also apply to my everyday life; it is just how I am wired, how I think.  I am unable to separate the two.  I think that Sam Harris has done an excellent job at explaining why this characteristic of my own behavior (which may or may not be shared by other scientists) is the way it is and why it should be applied to the non-work facets of our lives.  I think that it is possible to condense the thoughts here to a simple statement.  \\"If life is a book and you already know the ending, what is the point of continuing to read?\\"  I don't know the end of the book (in other words, I don't know the answers to the big life questions), but I am not willing to take it on another person's authority that they know the ending any better than I, because the ending is not \\"viewable\\" (i.e. technology doesn't exist to discover the answers, testable hypotheses aren't available, etc.).  Somehow, not knowing makes life worth living every day.  I am excited when I wake up in the morning because I get to go do science (something I really love) and the possibilities of finding something new are my driving force.  Surrendering to some concept which lacks evidence would somehow be antithetical to the way I have chosen to live my life, and would also somehow say that I felt like I or the rest of humanity lacked the intelligence and willpower to continue researching to find the answers.  Perhaps this is the most important part.  Humans are inherently inquisitive.  If we stop asking questions, somehow we stop being ourselves. <br /> <br />Read this book.  It will both enrage you and encourage you at the same time.  It will also make you think and most importantly, it will make you ask questions.
B000066C1N|4.0|I bought it for my kids (2 and 4 years old).  They liked very much the film and its music and eventhough we listen the film in spanish - they don't speak english yet - including the songs which are very well translated, they liked the english original version from Bryan Adams which appears in the bonus tracks of the DVD.
0689877692|4.0|The book was a good as advertised and my wife loved it.  The only problem is that the book is very fragile.  It arrived with one string broken and a twirler that did not twirl.  Amazon.com replaced it but the replacement also had a broken string.  I was able to fix it, but it was annoying nonetheless.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had not even heard of this show until this year, and based on the number of glowing recommendations I went out and bought the full series in DVD. I have to say that it might be the best $35 I've ever spent. <br /> <br />The premise of the show is essentially Star Trek + Wild Wild West (the original TV series, not the terrible movie). Sound like it sucks? Well, if you can get over that, you get to partake in one of the best science fiction series I've ever seen. The show was cut short due to Fox's itchy trigger finger with cancelling shows, but these fourteen episodes alone are spectacular enough as it is. <br /> <br />I don't typically buy things like \\"The Complete Season of...\\", but I did here, and I'm very glad I did. You have to buy this, and you have to buy Serenity, the movie that caps the whole thing off, and although it may seem like quite a bit to purchase, after you watch the 14 episodes you will be demanding to see the movie immediately.
B0001AVZA8|4.0|I really enjoyed this film from start to finish. Jack Nicolson shines and Diane Keaton is great. The soty is good about a man in his 60's who dates younger women about half his age, he then has a heart attack and falls for the women he's dating's mother. The film is great and shows what love really is and shows the reality on life. The last 20 min of the movie is a little slow but other then that it's hallariouse and fun to watch.
0446343129|2.0|The focus is far too much on the history of sugar and not enough on why I should abandon it.  It's a very dense read with small, dense typeface.  Not much in the way of anecdotes or testimonials.  I suspect there are more inspirational books out there.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Forest Gump a movie to savore and watch over and over again. I really enjoyed this film from start to finish and there was no slow parts that draged on the whole movie was great. The acting is great from Tom Hanks(oscar winning role) as Forest Gump, Robin Wright Penn as Jenny Forest's only one true love and then there is Gary Sinise who dose a great job and is  a scene steller. The sotry follows a man who's lfe is shown from the 50's to 90's. We see him meet Elvis as a young man, meet all the president's, go to vietnam and amny more. The film is also good history lesson. This is one movie we will enver forget.
B000AARKOO|5.0|This film had a story line that I found interesting from the start.  In terms of cinematography, music score, etc I don't necessarily watch movies for that, but let's get some of that out of the way.  In terms of epic scenes this rates right up there with the epic scenes in Lord of the Rings, in terms of individual fight scenes this rates on par with Gladiator.   <br /> <br />Of course the area where some Americans give this a low rating is because of the story line.  The Pope, the catholic counselors, and the Templars are not shown in such a great light.  They are secretly plotting and instigating wars.  Templars thought it heresy to portray the Muslims as anything other than villianistic muderers who should be wiped out. This film portrayed the Muslims as having some virtues and good morals, And some Christians were shown to be greedy conniving plotters of war and vengence. <br /> <br />The overall offense of the movie was that it clearly showed the utter futility of some wars which result in the unnecessary death of hundreds of thousands.   <br /> <br />I can not defend the historical accuracy of the film, but taking a chance and saying this message in film was quite a bold move especially in these times. The Christian, the Jew and the Muslim all share in the guilt of greed and war, and all three groups claim God is on their side and would kill, cheat, lie and steal for their God.  Usually the hollywood myth is that the good guy always wins, or White America always prevails through violence, or we always defeat the aliens.  This was not the case in Kingdom of Heaven.  Peace was the victor, however, in the end a god-forsaken \\"christian\\" white man was still the hero and not Islam.  That is somewhat still a hollywood ending. <br /> <br />Great movie.  Give it a look.

0780622553|5.0|This smart sci-fi film about a man with no memory trying to unravel his past while being pursued by strange beings through an ever changing city is a visionary triumph.Director Alex Projas went on to make the more mainstream I,Robot but this is his masterpiece here.It's inteligent inspires a sense of wonder and is the most visually inventive film since Blade Runner.Admitedly the Matrix may have more explosive action but Dark City is full of terrific atmosphere and creative visuals.Like Blade Runner it loses some of it's glory on the small screen though that shouldn't stop sci-fi fans from discovering this film that Roger Ebert and I(though not in the same room)called the Best Film of 1998.And like any classic it's as good today as it was back then!
1573225517|4.0|This is a great book. I think every guy over 25 years will feel that he has gone through some of the same stuff at least once or twice.  Great for music and movies lovers.  Read it before watching the movie.
B0009VRHLK|1.0|Gallo's first movie Buffalo 66 with Christinia Ricci was decent so I thought his new one The Brown Bunny couldn't be as bad as everyone said.It's not as bad as people told me...it's worse much much more worse!Not to give anything away but the entire movie is just Gallo driving around ending with a short graphic sex act in a hotel room.This \\"movie\\" is so devoid of incident it shouldn't even qualify as a film.Even if you're slightly curious about this ...thing my advice is to avoid The Brown Bunny like you would avoid a steaming pile of brown.....
B0000630BT|5.0|What is their to say? It is a different sound than the rest of their stuff, it's more paced and faster, but it is definately better! It's goofy when people say \\"I like 'Antoher thing commin' so I'm a Priest Fan\\" but they've never even heard Painkiller! <br />It's good. All the songs are good. Enough said.
0553801503|3.0|I finally, after four or so months, finished Feast this weekend. While I liked this one the least of the four so far, it still had a lot going for it. <br /> <br />Best view points this time around were Jaime (again) and, believe it or not, Sansa. I'll be interested to see Petyr's promise to her fulfilled, if it comes to pass as he describes it. <br /> <br />I'm eagerly awaiting Dance so I can read more on Jon, Dany and Bran.
B0006IIPIK|3.0|This is a spoiler-free review of the \\"Sky Captain\\" DVD. <br /> <br />There's absolutely no doubt that \\"Sky Captain\\" is a sincere labor of love for its primary behind-the-scenes creators, and it's truly amazing to consider that virtually everything in this film is a CGI effect. But unless you're an aspiring desktop filmmaker yourself, it's difficult to appreciate this film on almost any level since it's a technical tour-de-force that could have benefited from experienced screenwriters and directors. It pains me to write this, because like \\"Sky Captain\\"'s creators, I love 1930s pulp sci-fi adventures. But unlike vintage 1930s adventures, this one isn't going to be enjoyable for the average moviegoer. Jude Law and Gweyneth Paltrow literally sleepwalk their way through this, the musical score is both redundant and annoying, the editing isn't tight enough, and after a certain point the endless 1930s retro references (from \\"Wizard of Oz\\" to \\"Superman\\" to \\"King Kong\\") get tiresome. Only Angelina Jolie, in an extended cameo, is a delight. <br /> <br />On the other hand, there are some amazing extras on this disc. It's a pleasure and a treat to see the extended behind-the-scenes footage of the making of the movie. They reveal a joy and love for the source material that isn't always evident in the finished product. Also, love it or hate it, the attention to 1930s-style art deco design is technically impressive. There were many times I hit the \\"pause\\" button on my DVD player to better enjoy the beautiful production art and illustrations. We also have, in its entirety, the original 6-minute long \\"Sky Captain\\" short subject filmed on a shoestring budget and edited on a mid 1990s Mac computer. Unlike most DVD extras, these are actually informative and make an excellent companion to the finished film. In fact, these extras make this DVD worth a purchase for any budding budget filmmakers who would like a behind-the-scenes glimpse behind an independent effects-heavy production. <br/> <br />In sum, this is a mixed bag of a movie that will appeal more to those with a technical interest in moviemaking than those looking for a great film.
B000001DQG|4.0|Okay, while this is certainly not one of EJ's all-time best albums (only Captain Fantastic and Tumbleweed Connection were truly outstanding from start to finish), Caribou still ranks very good, especially considering Elton's sharp decline following Rock of the Westies. <br /> <br />Caribou's strength rides foremost on the contribution of Tower of Power's horn section;  Bitch Is Back, You're So Static, and Stinker are all top-notch tunes.  The beautifully sung Pinky, the chilling ballad Ticking, and the classic Don't Let The Sun are the 3 other highlights of this album. <br /> <br />Grimsby, Dixie, and Saucers certainly can't be considered great, and not everone will love them.  But they are catchy songs, and the latter two can be quite infectious if you get into singing along with them. <br /> <br />This leaves us with Solar Prestige.  Yes, very weak;  regardless of the reasons for which it was written and included on this album, it sucked back in 1974, and it still sucks now. <br /> <br />In essence we have one very weak track.  Look at some of the other more highly acclaimed EJ albums (such as Honkey Chateau, Don't Shoot Me, & Madman), and you'll find at least two very weak tracks (and arguably more) on each.  Even everyone's favorite -- Yellow Brick Road -- gave us some sketchy tracks;  the obnoxious Grey Seal, with it's horribly loud and grating chorus, and Harmony, which was sweet when i was a kid, but it's really an amazingly sappy tune. <br /> <br />Caribou has stood the test of time, at least as well as the rest of EJ's 1970-1975 era.  This reviewer highly recommends it.
0060723513|5.0|I felt this book had a great historical outlook. The authors personal thoughts were added to allow the reader to understand where they were coming from.
0688170528|5.0|*SPOILER* <br /> <br />I've been reading through some of the reviews and many of you say that the book was \\"unbelievable\\", with \\"conceited and horribly written characters\\". <br /> <br />I, however, beg to differ. <br /> <br />I thought Picoult expertly displayed the true horror Chris felt when Emily had expressed her ideas of ending the life he had grown to love so much.  They were fused together.  If, at one point in any one of your lives, you were presented with the aspect of someone you love so much killing themselves, you might think differently.  And, Picoult made it a point to have that last dialogue between McAfee and Chris near the end of his trial -- the one where he kept yelling, \\"I don't know!\\" through his sobs.  That just proves that it wasn't even Chris who pulled the trigger -- during the flashback at the carousel it specifically said that it was Emily who had squeezed the trigger.  I think she just needed the reassurance that Chris was letting her go before she could gather up the courage to truly end her life. <br /> <br />Anyway, as a person who is highly interested in the topic of teen suicide, I found the book absolutely riveting.  And, at face value, a great read.  Sure, maybe some of the particulars were imperfect but that goes to say with any book, no matter what genre, author, or style.  I fell in love with the characters, felt their pain and even found myself crying every step of the way.
0307276902|3.0|Much preferred MY FRIEND LEONARD which I read before the major hoopla over the \\"authenticity\\" of A Million Little Pieces and his appearances on Larry King and Oprah for the second time.<br /><br />The minute details of drug addiction just isn't that interesting if you've read numerous books or seen films on the subject, and know that the drug addicted life is really no life at all and that the power required to overcome addiction is tremendous.
1401308201|5.0|The book Wicked:  The Grimmerie,......., is an EXCELLENT look at the making of a Broadway Musical.  As a true fan of musicals it was fabulous to get an inside look at how the musical, Wicked, was created.  For fans this is a must!
B000002L82|5.0|One of the best rock records of all time. One of the best dance/electronic records of all time. Way ahead of the pack at 1983?!, timeless and not stuck in 80's /new wave AT ALL if you ask me. Much more musically varied and interesting than much of today's electronica scene as much as I like all of that too. Early electronic dance music with a post-punk attitude. Emotionally moody and yearning. Great imagery. Sumner's vocals are weak and strained but ultimatly that becomes a huge charm as it seems vulnerable and..well..punkish in spirit in an odd way. Also..a surprizingly soulful record too with the italo-disco element...but this time existentailly wounded. Funky and pyschedelic too with all the key bending stuff on the synths. If all alternative and dance music could be this interesting. All this AND one the best record covers of all time by Manchester graphic designer Peter Saville also..way ahead of the curve. A reason to have it on vinyl however(which includes a secret message in the color codes on the the back of the album which refer to Factory Records' release catalogue system!). This record is a total winner.
B000A0GP0Y|4.0|Let's face it.  Hitting refs with a football in their own very personal foul areas is just funny.  Fortunately, there's a lot more funny stuff where that came from in this comedic remake of The Longest Yard.  I was never a big fan of the original, so I can't compare and contrast the two here.  What I can say is that the remake, which milks as many stereotypes as it can find for all their comedic worth, is a genuinely funny movie.  There's no effort to make some kind of sociological argument here.  The Longest Yard is just a comedy, pure and simple.  Even the one serious moment in the film doesn't really hit you with anything more than surprise at what just happened.<br /><br />With the tandem of Adam Sandler and Chris Rock leading the way, you know you're going to do some laughing.  Combining two such heavyweight comedians in one film, though, is a handicap in some ways because your expectations may be too high going in.  That's probably why some viewers don't think the film is funny enough for their liking.  I think the inclusion of Burt Reynolds in the cast was a bit of risk, but the role of the old veteran really fits in perfectly with the script.  The rest of the cast is a hodgepodge of surprising faces: Cloris Leachman as the warden's lecherous (and thereby disgusting) secretary; professional wrestlers Bill Goldberg (who, like Burt Reynolds, did play college FB), Kevin Nash, and Steve Austin; former NFL players Michael Irvin (Michael Irvin as a prison inmate is perfect casting, if you ask me), Bill Romanowski, and Brian Bosworth (who was in the NFL only long enough for my man Bo Jackson to run him over on Monday Night Football).  With Sandler serving as executive director, you have to wonder how this motley crew of individuals could have been held together long enough to actually make a movie.  You can't argue with results, though.<br /><br />There's not much to the story.  Paul Crewe (Sandler) is a former NFL MVP whose career ended with a point shaving scandal.  Now, six years later, he seems determined to ruin his life completely and winds up in the big house, Texas-style.  The warden wants him to help get his prison guard football team in shape for the upcoming season, and he ends up recruiting a team of convicts to take on the guards in a pre-season game.  All of the inmates hated him at first, with the exception of Caretaker (Chris Rock), so he's got his work cut out even fielding a team, let alone teaching them how to play.  There are some bad dudes in the joint, though, and the opportunity to crack heads with the hated guards can be a pretty powerful recruiting tool.  The game itself turns into a big event, as ESPN2 and Chris Berman come in to broadcast it nation-wide.  You know everything that's going to happen, but it doesn't matter one iota.  The closest thing you get to suspense is your natural curiosity over the possibility of Burt Reynolds' overstretched face popping at any given moment.<br /><br />Is this Adam Sandler or Chris Rock at his best?  No, not by a long shot.  Still, it's a consistently funny film, and you just can't go too far wrong with a combination of comedy and football - not with male viewers, anyway.scandal.

0062502182|4.0|This book was simply but elegantly written, telling the story of Santiago the sheperd who goes in pursuit of his Personal Legend.  I took out of the novel the reminder that everything happens for a reason....though I had learned many of the lessons illustrated in the book, it was a profound reminder that these lessons happen to everyone, everywhere in some way or another. <br /> <br />The story itself was neat and straightfoward, Santiago's goal clearly outlined from the beginning.  However, I thought the most important part of the book was not what Santiago discovers at the end, but in the people he meets and the opportunities he has along the way.  Each personal connection he makes is another signal to the reader that if one works hard in the pursuit of a dream, it will be fulfilled, but perhaps not in the way (or in the time) that the reader may think.   <br /> <br />I have found that often the most ultimately satisfying experiences come as a complete surprise...The Alchemist was a sweet, succinct way to reminisce about these types of experiences.  I would recommend this book to everyone - it is a quick read and I think all who read it will be touched.
B000059QY3|4.0|I enjoyed this video very much.  This is a recording of a live presentation.  Most impressive, apart from Gherghiu's amazing voice was the amazing clarity of the photography.  My only critism is that I longed for some close up view's of Ms Gheorghiu's face.
B00005ABUB|5.0|The Bionic Man (Steve Austin) played by Lee Majors opened the minds and hearts of audiences across the globe to an era when we hungered for superheros.  He had a knack for being able to help mediate problems across our globe to a point where the only resolution at hand was by the hand.  This science fiction program introduces a new concept to our world of robots and cyborgs.  A superhero with cybernetic strength created by humans using artificial limbs integrated into Steve Austin's humanity in order to enhance his ability to fight off all that is evil.  We americans are once again ready to embrace this hero back into our imaginations to inspire us with hope.  Where are you Steve?
B00005V1Y0|5.0|A movie to enjoy watching many times. Very entertaining and light.
B000006NPY|5.0|I've learned that I tend to be in a different boat than most Pumpking fans when it comes to this album.  I absolutely love this album.  When I bought in 1998, I was a bit irritated by it, but after actually listening to it with an open mind, it became amazing.  I'm now buying my second copy, as mine is almost unplayable now!  It's definitely not what one would expect from the pumpkins, and the drum machine is, well, a drum machine...but a wonderful album. I wish I had gotten a chance to hear it live.  It's definitely worth giving a shot, and if you love it half as much as I did, it is worth whatever you paid for it!
B00001OH7O|5.0|The more I listen to this album the more i discover.. There are several beautiful songs on this one - including 'Changes', 'oh you pretty things', 'life on mars', and 'Andy Warhol'. This is the beginning of Bowie's most creative period that I believe lasted through the 'diamond dogs' album. It does not have the same concept appeal as 'Ziggy Stardust' and subsequent albums, but musically speaking it is every bit as good.. Bowie and Ronson had a very unique sound that has not lost any of its power in 2006!
B00005JGAB|5.0|The good:  What can I say that hasn't already been said? This album may not have invented punk rock music, but it has defined it for 30+ years. With great songs like \\"53rd & 3rd,\\" \\"Judy Is A Punk,\\" \\"Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue,\\" and the immortal \\"Blitzkrieg Bop,\\" the tracklist reads more like a greatest hits compilation than a regular album.    The bad:  Not a thing.    Overall:  If you're a punk fan, you need this album. If you're a rock and roll fan, you need this album. It revolutionized rock music, and three decades later, every track still sounds as fresh and vibrant as the day they were recorded.
0446577383|5.0|This is an excellent book.  Too bad it isn't this easy to eliminate terrorists.  Baldacci as always keeps you on the edge as you race through the book.  I can't wait to get his next book.  Get to work!!
B00008PC2O|5.0|Excellent product but for those out side region1 beware.It can be viewed in HD format but with considerable difficulty. If your interest is in sampling HD TV outside the states then look at one of the IMAX derived films like \\"SPEED\\" these are excellent starters even if watched on the ordinary DVD's (provided you can view region 1 DVD's). The extra effort to see the WMVHD version of T2 is worth it if you can be bothered, and the value is superb even allowing for postage from the states.
B00014K5TQ|4.0|Video is not for your average viewer. Strong content. The sad part is that it is based on a true story.
B000A0GP4K|3.0|The first time I watched this DVD, I was mesmerized. It was so intriging to see Dylan in concert and in real life. It is raw and it is real. What a unique character he is and was. It was interesting to hear Bob speak now about his life back in the the 60's. He has mellowed so much, but still maintains his unique personality.
1881273156|4.0|This book did more than most 'relationship' books in helping to repair my marriage of nearly 20 years. We are doing much better after reading this book. The book's style is a bit schlocky for my taste, but it is an easy read and is not filled with jargon.  I bought two of these books so that I have a copy to lend to friends in need.  I certainly recommend it.
B00001ODGR|5.0|The band sounds great.  The picture quality is perfect. <br />Good editing and camera movement make you feel like you're at the show.  They play all of their hits and their interaction with the audience is fantastic.  Definitely one of the best concert DVDs I've come across.

B0002F6AH0|5.0|Simply put, it is one of the best total documentaries on the Second World War.  Olivier is moving and the bonus footage makes the 30th Anniversary Edition truly worth every cent.  Buy it and share it and use it to make people understand that this event will effect human lives for hundreds if not thousands of years.
B000BVQ9JO|3.0|Another good album put out by the NY boys.  It's always going to be tough for them to top their stellar debut album \\"Is This It\\", but the good hooks and Julian's signature \\"singing into a cell phone\\" style are always going to be better than most of what we're hearing these days.
B00006JDVV|3.0|This movie is entertaining but I expected more. . . more screen time with a shirtless Christian Bale.  He's an excellent actor but my God that body. If you're hot for Christian Bale this is the best he's looked-dirt and all.
B00008O31H|5.0|The Black Keys sophomore effort doesn't disappoint folks that enjoyed their debut album \\"The Big Come Up.\\"  More straight up blues-rock from the Akron duo.  Their second album includes the song \\"Set You Free\\" which appears in the movie \\"School of Rock\\" & in the new Nissan Xterra commerical.

0307263118|3.0|The Sea by John Banville is a thrilling book to read, at least at the outset.  Its structure is slightly challenging, the images shimmer, and the vocabulary will send most readers running for [...]  Banville tells his story in three parts: a boyhood encounter, the loss of a wife, and the narrator's grieving attempts to recover the past.  The parts are scrambled, bleeding one into another, linked by imagery.  As I read, I lost more and more interest, primarily because the narrator was so pathetic and clueless.  It wasn't the cluelessness of grief or old age--it was just that Banville dumbed him down to make his plot work.  Or, maybe to keep him for competing with the power of the images.  Banville is a master of metaphors and similes, and their beauty and power kept me reading, hoping that the book's three stories would resolve in some form of strength. <br /> <br />I belong to a tiny reading club.  We pass books around by mail and have asynchronous discussions via MSN Messenger.  I cannot decide if The Sea is worth inflicting on my fellows or even worth the postage.  I would recommend it highly as an example of figurative writing to students.  As a novel, it is a disappointing little character study.
0316776963|5.0|Sedaris is witty moving and hysterical. He finds humor in everything, and twists it into lessons and love. Whether he is describing his lack of French fluency, childhood guitar lessons, or his time as an \\"artist\\" Sedaris writes to every audience, adressing questions, fears, and joys of every life.
B000006045|2.0|Teardrop, with the mesmerizing vocals of Liz Fraser, is the standout track - unfortunately the rest doesn't quite measure up. Don't get me wrong - Mezzanine is a very \\"listenable\\" album, something that works well playing in the background at night (some tracks work especially well for seductive exploits). It's just that the rest of this album sounds like second-rate Portishead.
0452286379|5.0|For years I had known people who read Ms. Rand's books and raved about them.  Now I understand.  But take heed: her other major work (Atlas Shrugged) is not a good introduction to Rand; the Fountainhead is the proper starting point.  It certainly deserves to be included among any top ten list of American classics.  A belief system that values the creative power of the individual, strength of character, uncompromising principles, and other admirable qualities are told in a compelling manner.  You must view the world (and your role in it) a bit differently after reading this book.  Now, why the heck isn't the Gary Cooper movie version out on DVD?  Strangely, the book seems to explain that too.
B0009MAP90|3.0|The reissues of Bob Dylan and The Times They Are A-Changin' are excellent releases on their own merits. Still, I can't help but feel like both of these releases fall short of the phenomenal 2003 remasters of much of the Dylan catalog. Those discs were Hybrid-SACDs, packaged in cardboard cases that replicated the original album jackets and artwork. By contrast, these 2005 remasters are regular old CDs, and packaged in standard, generic jewel cases. Curiously, the 2003 series was issued on the Sony/Legacy label, while the 2005 titles are released by Columbia. This may account for the difference.  <br /> <br />Of course, the music is as great as it always was, and the remasters are much better than the old CDs. Still, it's troubling to see Sony taking a step back from the care that they had previously given to the Dylan catalog. Here's hoping Sony gives the future remasters of albums like The Basement Tapes and Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid the consideration they are due.
0316172324|4.0|I find the authors book to be very interesting. Thin slicing is something we all do everyday and do not realize it. I would recommend this book to everyone. <br />The one suggestion I have would be to not go into so much detail with the examples provided. The story about the war and it's methods was way to long.

0345404475|5.0|This has been one of my favorites for decades. The movie Blade Runner was shallow and disappointing after the book. I recently re-read it and \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\" holds up just as well now as it did when I first read it in the early '70s. Like any good psychopath, the androids lack empathy. While more intelligent than humans, the androids are chilling and horrifying, even as both the main character and reader find themselves questioning their own sympathy for them. As the android Rachel says: she has \\"empathy\\" for herself. And yes that does make them fundamentally different from the rest of us humans and animals that do have empathy for each other. Is this about robotics?: no. It's about what makes us whole sane beings.
0553573403|5.0|Eddard \\"Ned\\" Stark is the Lord of Winterfell, a Northern fortress that is one of the Seven Kingdoms, united under the rule of Ned's oldest and dearest friend, King Robert Baratheon.  Along with his wife Lady Catelyn, his 14-year-old heir Robb, and his other three sons and two daughters, Ned is content to preside over the vast North kingdom, away from the politics, trials, and tribulations of King's Landing, far to the South, where Robert sits on the Iron Throne.<br /><br /> Everything changes when the Starks are visited at Winterfell by King Robert and his party, including Queen Cersei, daughter of the powerful and ambitious Lord Tywin Lannister; and Prince Joffrey, the arrogant, petulant heir to Robert's throne.  Also with the King's party are Cersei's brothers: Jaime, her twin, and Tyrion, a clever dwarf known as The Imp.  The King has come to Winterfell to ask Ned to serve the realm as the King's Hand, an appointment that has become necessary due to the recent mysterious death of Lord John Arryn, the former Hand, who was the husband of Lady Catelyn's sister Lyssa.<br /><br /> Although he is not happy about it, Ned cannot refuse his king's request, and makes preparations to leave Winterfell with his daughters and most of his household.  Robb is to remain as Lord of Winterfell, with Lady Catelyn to advise him.  On the eve of their departure, a tragedy strikes as Bran, the Starks' seven-year-old son, is crippled in a fall from a castle balcony.  As Catelyn begins a long vigil by Bran's bedside, Ned rides South with the King and his party.  Days later, an assassin attacks the unconscious Bran, meaning to cut his throat; the murder is prevented by Lady Catelyn and Bran's pet direwolf, Summer.  The assassin's weapon links him with the Lannisters, and Robb and Lady Catelyn realize that Bran must have seen or heard something that the Lannisters desperately wanted kept secret.<br /><br /> Reaching King's Landing, Ned finds advising the King and leading the King's Small Council to be distasteful and challenging.  He soon becomes convinced that John Arryn was murdered, and secretly begins an investigation.  In short order he learns that the Queen has a secret, a secret for which John Arryn died, and for which Ned's son Bran almost died.  Joffrey is not the rightful heir to Robert's throne.  But before Ned can act, King Robert is mortally wounded by a giant boar while hunting.  Although Robert, on his deathbed, names Ned Protector of the Realm until Joffrey comes of age, Ned is outwitted by Queen Cersei and imprisoned as a traitor.  Ned's household is slaughtered.  His youngest daughter Arya escapes, wandering the streets disguised as an orphan boy.  His daughter Sansa, still betrothed to newly-crowned King Joffrey, is held by the Lannisters.<br /><br /> Lord Tywin Lannister and his son Jaime see this as their opportunity to strike, and they raise a host, attacking the River Lords, including Lady Catelyn's father, Hoster Tully, and his son Edmure, Catelyn's brother.  In the North, learning of his father's imprisonment and the attacks on the Tullys, Robb Stark calls his bannermen and builds an  army of his own.  Listening well to his advisors, including his Lady Mother, and leading his troops bravely in battle, the Boy Lord of Winterfell lures Jaime Lannister into a well-set trap.  Robb's troops crush Jaime's army, which had been laying siege to the Tully stronghold Riverrun, taking Jaime prisoner, and freeing Riverrun.  The Stark host cuts Tywin Lannister off from his supply base at Casterly Rock.  As new threats arise to King Joffrey in the South, Lord Tywin is forced to break up what remains of his host, sending Tyrion to King's Landing to protect and advise Cersei and Joffrey.<br /><br /> George R.R. Martin has created an epic fantasy for adults.  Like Tolkien and Jordan, he has developed a world, with a rich history and geography.  His character development is some of the best I've ever read.  His plot is complex, multi-layered, and intriguing.  Despite the length of his novels, his prose is readable and the reader will turn the pages quickly.  Be warned: there's sex, profanity, and graphic descriptions of violence.  This is meaty, satisfying stuff.  I give it my highest recommendation.ulti-layered, and intriguing.

0345350499|5.0|I feel helpless trying to describe in full the utterly undescribable genious of Marion Zimmer Bradley and I wish dearly that she were still living so that I could write to her and tell her how inspirational I find her work to be. As such, I will do her memory justice with the best online review I can write. <br /> <br />This book is, above anything, else a philosphical essay. Is there really a god? Is there really a goddess? Is there such a thing as Fate? And can we really paint people black and white, call them good or evil?  <br /> <br />It is my belief that the overall message of this book was precisely this: there isn't a god or goddess that drives the fates of man. What we believe becomes our reality.  <br /> <br />Morgaine of the Fairies believed so much that she was doing the right thing -- that she was obeying the goddess -- that she was driven into hurting those people that she loved dearest. This is exetremly ironic, for as a young woman Morgaine had defyed the goddess and her will and runaway from Avalon. Why suddenly in her old age was it paramount that she obey her goddess? Not only did she renounce the goddess as a young woman, but she sneered on Christian people for their bigotry and narrowmindedness and for trying to make everyone worship their christian god  . . . when she herself was doing the exact same thing with the goddess! This makes her a hyprocirte on the highest degree  -- but here's the thing . . . hyprocrisy is human. <br /> <br />Gwenthfhwar is another fanatical hyprocrite and is nearly as bad as Morgaine when it comes to christianity and her One god. And yet, while Gwen preaches and looks down her nose on those \\"wicked\\" pagans . . . she is commiting adultery behind her husband's back. Is this not hyprocrisy as well? <br /> <br />The only person in the entire book that seems pure of sin and wrong is King Arthur, who is torn between his wife and his halfsister in their theological fued for his heart. Deep within, he cares really not for what god flies on his banner and leads him into battle, but only for the happiness of everyone around him. So he goes to lengths to please his christian wife and his pagan halfsister. And in a way . . . King Arthur's innocense and lack of hyprocrisy almost make him perfect.  He is almost not human in this way, but a god that everyone worships and adores. <br /> <br />In the end, none of the characters are really good or evil. People don't do things to be evil, they do them because  they think they're right, and this book shows it on the plainest level of understanding. I would have read this entire book if only for the touching love scenes between Arthur and Morgaine, so tender was their love for each other. <br /> <br />Don't miss the romance, the betrayal, the lust and the sorrow.  At least check this book out from the library and I guarantee you'll want to buy it.
B000000W5P|3.0|I remember well the orginal LP (that my brother brought home and said \\"don't let Dad hear this!\\") with the reversable sleeve to change the faces under the wigs. I love this recording and agree with most of the positive reviews here, however I'm writing this as 3 stars because I am deeply disappointed in the remastered version, and since most people looking at this CD are probably already familiar with these songs (unless they've been living in a cave without a radio for the last 25 years). The remastered version just sounds flat on everything from my Event studio monitors to the boom box in my garage. What happened to the let it bleed concept? Where is the air that gave the Stones such a great sound? It is there on my record, but not on this CD release. I think I'm going to find and play the record straight into the computer and make my own CD with NO remastering. Anyway 4 stars to the STones, -1 to those responsible for squashing the sound.
B000024D4R|5.0|it's a testimony to floyd's greatness that animals gets lost in shuffle with pink floyd. if they hadn't done the classic radio evergreen \\"dark side of the moon\\" or the high school stoner soundtrack \\"the wall,\\" this would be remembered as their crowning achievement. Waters is no Orwell and I find the lyrics sometimes simplistic at times, but how many rock albums take on greed, corporate bullies and other topics with this kind of intelligence? For me, what makes this album, as with all floyd albums, is the music.
B00001U0DP|5.0|I came across this film by accident and am so glad I did. For those of you who have commented on the film making light of the Holocaust I have to say that it only appears to if you have that thought from the beginning. To me it made as much of an impact as any of the more intense films about those times. As a dad I could only look at my daughter after the film and be so thankful that nothing as obscene and foul will ever happen to us two. The way that a fathers struggle to protect his child from the horrific acts around them was portrayed so well that it brought tears to my eyes...a wonderful film...just concentrate on the feelings not the historical accuracy.

The singles were great and classic as were the videos, but the albums were always bad in the 80's up til her \\"Like A Prayer\\" album.  \\"Madonna\\" even further proves that point.  The singles \\"Lucky Star\\", \\"Holiday\\" and \\"Borderline\\" are all incredible and made her into a star.  If you want a bunch of filler songs then buy this. Otherwise I'd ignore it if I were you.

B000E97Y6K|4.0|This is an amazing piece of work, the special effects are simply spectacular and the digital King Kong has to be seen to believe, I mean his fur even rustles the wind.  The battles on the island between Kong and the TRex's is as visually brillant as anything I have ever seen of film, but alas this film is hella long.  Does Peter Jackson know what a film editor is, the first half of the film, though well done, drags and Watts and the unique looking Brody, have no chemistry and that hurts.  Black was an odd choice, but he works here, sort of.  When I was young my Dad took me to see the 70's Kong, uh hardly the 30's classic, but I remember how beautiful Jessica Lange was and what great chemistry she had with Kong, it was  touching and strangely erotic, but this film loses all of that, Watts and Kong have a totally platonic relationship, I guess this is a P.C. Kong...too bad, because it makes the ending, though sad, not as heartbreaking as watching Lange scream from the depths of her soul when he dies, it was Langes breakout role and she really made you feel that she had fallen in love with Kong, a real beauty and the beast, this film lacks that element and I think it hurts the overall power of Kongs death.  I do totally recommend this DVD, it's a visually spectacular film, that needed a Jessica Lange, and an editor...too bad it posseses neither.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Thank God this isn't another humdrum nameless rock band. Though it has been described as a Radiohead clone (not altogether untrue), Muse has one very important difference: It goes somewhere with it's music. This is neither head beating rock nor mystical trance, but instead treads the thin line that Radiohead crossed only with difficulty. The seamless blend of music and emotion sets the band far apart from others of it's generation accused of being mere repetitions of older and greater bands. Though Muse does sound like the aforementioned band, it is like Radiohead Version 2. And evolutions are good, right? It has kept the good, fixed the bad, and enhanced the experience.

0553288105|5.0|To elevate a work of science fiction from mere novel to literary masterwork is an achievement to which few authors can lay claim. Asimov is one of those authors and \\"The Gods Themselves\\" is one of those rare classics. Asimov has expertly blended visionary and imaginative yet credible hard science with a softer side of science fiction that includes an exciting story line, both human and alien characters that are so much more than cardboard cut-outs and a thoughtful exploration of the world in which he has placed his story.<br /><br />Those who prefer their sci-fi hard will marvel at Asimov's prescient cosmological vision of communication and transportation of matter between parallel universes. This communication, a source of unlimited non-polluting energy,also causes a slow leakage of the fundamental characteristics of the joined universes resulting in a reduction of the magnitude of the strong nuclear force in our universe. A few scientists have determined that as this effect accumulates, the sun will become a super nova and our little galactic corner of the universe will explode into a quasar. (There goes the neighbourhood!).<br /><br />On the softer flip side of this particular sci-fi coin, Asimov has actually created three quite distinct short stories that combine to create an exhilarating unified whole. In the first we witness the purely serendipitous discovery of the portal between universes and we gasp as research into the potential harmful effects of the inter-universe communication is systematically suppressed by purely political and ego considerations. In the second story, Asimov takes us on a brief tour of the other side of that portal creating alien beings that are manifested in three distinct parts - rational, parental and emotional - and feed on pure energy. Asimov's rather imaginative exploration of their sexuality is exciting and evocative without losing sensitivity. In the final story of the three, Asimov takes us to a manned lunar station. The science issues are resolved satisfactorily in a setting that also includes a brilliant, probing exploration of the likely psychology of permanent human settlement away from earth in a physically, hostile alien environment such as the moon.<br /><br />An added bonus - a warm, fuzzy ending that cannot fail to bring a smile to any reader. If you're a lover of science fiction, your library remains incomplete unless you've added a copy of \\"The Gods Themselves\\"!<br /><br />Paul Weisscience issues are resolved satisfactorily in a setting that also includes a brilliant, probing exploration of the likely psychology of permanent human settlement away from earth in a physically, hostile alien environment such as the moon. <br /> <br />An added bonus - a warm, fuzzy ending that cannot fail to bring a smile to any reader.

B00023B1Y4|5.0|this movie is the story of the rangers and delta force members involved in the conflict in mogadishu in 1993. they are sent there to capture a violent warlord, whos terrible regime has lead to the starvation of thousands of somalis. they run several normal missions until one goes horribly wrong. i wont elaborate on the story much more but i will say, that it is one of the greatest/saddest war stories of all time. from the beginning scenes of the movie, you will become connected to some of the characters, some because of their viewpoints, some because of heroics, and some just because of their personality. during the battle that ensues, you will really feel the courage of those involved and you will understand why the ranger pact says to leave no man behind. <br /> <br />the acting in this movie is really what seperates it from others. the actors really put you into the shoes of a soldier under fire, or one thats been wounded. when a buddy is lost, you might just feel some of the emotional loss the other buddy has just expierenced. josh hartnett plays the lead role, but in my opinion, did not do the best job out of all the actors. Jason Isaacs does a great job with Captain Steele. he really seems like a hard-ass leader. Tom Sizemore also does a great job with his role as Lt. Col. Danny McKnight. these were some of the acting highlights to me, but many of the lesser parts were played amazingly well also. <br /> <br />the special effects in this movie are top notch. the gun noises and explosions make you feel like you are right in the middle of the conflict, especially with surround sound. i think the gore in this movie helps add to the fact that war is hell and it stays at a very realistic level. it doesnt get to horror movie levels, which, in this case, is a good thing, and it makes its point very well.  <br /> <br />if you read the book by Mark Bowden first and are looking to see this to compare the two, you will find some rather large differences. first off, many names have been changed, this may become confusing at first, but youll easily catch on. second, some of the positions of troops and chalks and what they do during the fight have been altered. for example, in the book, Eversman's chalk is picked up by the convoy and taken back to base before dark, yet in the movie, he and his men are in the thick of it the whole time. these things really dont detract from the movie much, but if you are really picky and detail oriented, they may get to you. <br /> <br />so overall, this is a great war movie. its got its share of gore, but the story and characters are amazing and the sheer amount of emotion displayed by the actors is outstanding. you will not be bored with this one. pick it up if you are a fan of war films for sure, but even if your not, you might want to check this out.
B000065BPB|5.0|I used to have sony mdr-v700s, I thought they were good until they broke causing me to buy new headphones. I got the senn 280s and pretty much sonys dont even compare, the clarity is far superior to the sonyv700s. The 700s where too bassey, on the senn the bass seems more accurate. I bought these for 100 and they are worth every penny. The only maybe downside is they dont sound too good with electronic with weak amplifiers, an ipod for instance doesnt sound great. These are monitoring headphones, so its not like they designed to be used with mp3 players.
B000AP04EW|4.0|this is a movie that doesnt get very complex. the plot is fairly easy to follow, and there arent all that many huge twists. its a simple film about two spies (pitt, jolie) that get married without knowing each others occupation, and the story is about how they tried to hide the fact from each other. it does get somewhat wierd as pitt and jolie get into a decision/conflict over their jobs and each other. there are some pieces that i wouldnt have added, and some others that i wouldve, to make this idea somewhat clearer and easier to understand why they start fighting and then stop, just to start again a few minutes later. thats pretty much the only part of the plot in this movie that gets harder to follow. now, im not a huge fan of long reviews (reading or writing) so there you go. <br /> <br />overall, this is a very good action movie. it doesnt have a complex plot or any super fancy special effects, and it certainly wont win any awards, but its fun and will keep you entertained until the end.
B00003CWPL|3.0|This may be the weirdest movie I have ever seen, but also one of the most unforgetable.  It supposedly took him 5 years to make it. <br />It is an indictment of the modern industrial society, pollution, <br />and social isolation.  The main character works in some non- <br />descript factory ,  marries, and fathers a \\"child\\".  The child <br />is some type of mutant with an eraser like head with its <br />internal organs contained in a cloth like suit.  The baby cries <br />all the time.  This family lives in a barren apartment with weird <br />sights  and sounds happening continuously.  One review I read <br />said you should see it in a theater as the sounds are more <br />prominent.  After a while , the story goes all to hell.  The mutant baby reminds me of Rosemary's Baby  where the Mia Farrow <br />character still loves her baby even if it is the devil. <br />In any event, it is cettainly worth seeing if only to experience <br />the David Lynch wierdness.  If you want to see other Lynch <br />gems, get Blue Velvet, Elephant Man, Lost Highway , and most <br />importantly , Mulholland Drive, which is a masterpiece. <br />Dan Harrell
B00005JL0I|4.0|The 1967 spoof is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. But, I give the original 1954 CBS/Climax Mystery Theater televison production 4 out of 5 stars. This movie is probobly the most accurate movie reproduction of any of the original books, with the next most accurate being On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Aside from the fact that Bond's and Leiter's affiliations are switched, Bond in the CIA and Leiter in MI6, whereas is should be the other way around, the accuracy is amazing. Peter Lorre is perfect as Le Chiffre, and is exactly as the character is described in the book. The only downside of this version, as it is the only one available on DVD, is the fact that the original ending is missing. In the full version, only available on VHS, Le Chiffre takes the razor blade out of his hat and tries to kill Valerie and Bond shoots him. This full version also ends with the cliche Bond ending, him kissing Valerie. This is the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars, they could and should have included the full version here.

0441172717|5.0|Frank Herbert builds a super complex universe that I find it hard to believe would do anything but fascinate a reader.  It took him several years to write the novel, and it shows. There are a lot of things in this novel. It tackles drug addiction, oil, mysticism, eastern religion, several other philosophys from the stance of a sci-fi/fantasy. It's a modern day epic in my mind. Just 'cause it is sci fi doesn't mean its not literary, either. Herbert has a lot to say, and he says it in the intrigue of this book.
B000BTDMDC|5.0|On the contrary to all the retards who don't know [anything] about good music, this album is perfect, mistakes n' all. It all adds to the character, making this album one of the best I've heard in a long, long time. \\"Too much hype\\" you say, well the music business is built on hype, to sell an album you need hype, to sell a single you need hype, hype makes the music world go round.  Make no comparison to this band, they are THEMSELVES, you cannot compare them to any other band because of course there will always be differences, so to say they are the next oasis, or whatever, is stupid as there will never be another band like oasis or any other band for that matter.   H.S.S. hmm interesting theory, of course it suffered from \\"H.S.S.\\" almost every band does, but it's that exact syndrome that will separate a good band from an excellent band, and if you have listened to the rest of the album you would realise this is an excellent band.  I cannot say enough good things about them, they have all the things I like, and I would hope everybody else likes, in a band and more, like thrashing guitars, tight rhythm sections and good, smart lyrics. And no, the songs do not sound the same, how can you say that, I seriously doubt if you have even listened to this album. This isn't Coldplay this is the Arctic Monkeys!!  The vocals are so full of feeling (the addictive accent all adds to the emotion especially in \\"When the Sun Goes Down\\") and do actually mean something, they tell a story, every song on the album tells a story, from \\"Riot Van\\" to \\"When the Sun Goes Down\\" and from \\"Still Take You Home\\" to \\"A Certain Romance,\\" unlike other songwriters who write lyrics just to go with the music.  There isn't a song on this album that I don't like, although I do love every single one. This band and this album are both things of greatness. The Arctic Monkeys should be and I think will be a success for years to come.  This isn't much of review, it's more of a rant, but it may hopefully persuade you to BUY THIS ALBUM!!
B000E1155E|5.0|While the band's arrival in the U.S. may be over-hyped, the band itself (that is 4 guys playing instruments) are not.  Have you heard the phase \\"If Shakespeare were alive today, he'd be a rock star\\"?  Well now he is and his name is Alex Turner and he's the singer in a band called the Arctic Monkeys.   <br /> <br />What makes it even better is that the drummer is top notch.  So you get brilliant songs with great rhythmn and intensity.  While they will be compared to guitar-and-drum bands of this era, their songs tend to be refreshingly expansive with lyrical and aural landscapes.   <br /> <br />Even if you didn't like the songs, if you watch the several free videos at mardy-bum.com, you'll see many fine examples of them playing live.  You'll see their fans singing along to all the lyrics.  That's the antithesis of hype.   It's talent.  The hype is all the legacy media types trying to make themselves appear relevant to a group that became stars without the media.
B000002LSV|4.0|ZZ Top is a classic American blues band. Billy Gibbons is a master of blues guitar. <br />Over the last 30 years or so they have come out with some of the finest blues you will ever hear. <br />Gimme All Your Lovin, Sharp Dressed Man, Tush, Sleeping Bag. Le Grange, Legs among others have made ZZ Top of of the finest bands in America. <br />This is a collection of song from their entire career.  <br />If you have not heard ZZ Top or if you just want their hit songs, this CD is for you. Enjoy...........
0679405496|4.0|Watched the movie which prompted me to purchase the book.  The book 'filled in the gaps' that the movie created.  Interesting historical information, from E.M. Fosters point of view.  I was easily transported to India by this book.  A good look at a different day in time.
B00000JG41|5.0|There is simply no other way to describe this album, other than a masterpiece. It is easily the most \\"normal\\" Bungle album, and the most prefected, and orchestrated. This album persuaded me to buy the other Mr. Bungle albums. If you're just starting to get into Mr. Bungle, this is an easy place to start, before moving into the extreme uniqueness of their Self Titled Debut. This album is made so good by Patton's vocals, which in this album are way more melodic than usual. He also does alot of doo-op style 60's vocals, which make the album complete, it seems. The rest of the band simply follows Patton's creative lead, and it creates an amazing work of art. Every single song on this album is amazing in its own unique way.  <br /> <br />Sweet Charity: <br />Begins with seagulls, and island sounding music. Very laid back and extremely well crafted. Very epic sounding. \\"Ba ba da ba\\" Pattons vocals make this song.  <br /> <br />None Of Them Knew They Were Robots: <br />A Rockabilly/ Jazz song with a walking baseline, and some cool Patton rythms. Very experimental, and its awesome overall. <br /> <br />RetroVertigo: <br />Another almost indescribeable song from this album. Very laid back. Patton uses his voice to create the rythm in this acoustically driven \\"clean\\" song. It is amazing, I cannot put enough emphasis on that. <br /> <br />This Air Conditioned Nightmare: <br />Cant really describe this one with words... It's great though, words wouldn't really do it justice. <br /> <br />Ars Moriendi: <br />Middle Eastern melodic song meets heavy guitar halfway through. Patton even sings with an accent! Very unique, and good. Imagine hearing someone blaring this while driving. <br /> <br />Pink Cigarette: <br />Probably my favorite song from this album. Sounds like a hit in the 60's. Very orchestrated sounding. Again, it sounds very happy and harmless until the end where it takes a drastic turn, \\"There's just 4 hours left until you'll find me dead.\\" And you figure out that thishappy song is really a suicide note. Patton counts down from 5 to 1 hour then the song ends with a flatline. An amazing song. <br /> <br />Golem II: The Bionic Vapor Boy: <br />Wierd. Unique. Patton. Mr. Bungle.  <br /> <br />The Holy Filament: <br />The most orchestrated song in the album. Very sinister sounding, with Patton's singing driving it. Almost sounds out of place in this album. If you are familiar with Patton's other project \\"Fantomas\\" You will be recognize songs of this caliber. (Sounds like something from Fantomas - Delirium Cordia) <br /> <br />Vanity Fair: <br />Patton almost sounds like Stevie Wonder. It's a LOVE song. From Mr. Bungle. Very interesting. \\"Even your shadow worships you.\\" ect. <br /> <br />Goodbye Sober Day: <br />This song is hard to describe, almost sounds like something from the other albums. Has some amazing vocals in it. You have to listen to it to know what I'm talking about <br /> <br /> <br />What makes California so great, is that every song has its own story, its own tune, and is completely different yet amazing in its own way.  <br />Highly recommended. Shame that this is Mr. Bungle's last album, I would've loved to hear more material like this.
B000301YY8|5.0|first let's say hte explicit version has the F word! actually <br />after a while it works better! very unique voice, great lyric's, <br />very different! the rod stewart comparison! no way! james blunt <br />can reach different ranges with his unique voice! some of the <br />guitar work on the CD reminds me of my fave male singer  <br />Chris Isaak! glad to know good music is still around. alot of <br />depth, pain, and truth went into making this CD! James Blunt <br />makes great music which gets better each listen! gonna order <br />alot of the CD singles with non- CD cuts! well i like it and <br />that is very rare with all the generic stuff out there today! <br />very good CD!
B000AQBA1W|5.0|I actually first heard this album on the in-flight radio on an Aer Lingus flight... lame, I know. It sort of caught my ear and so I took the chance and bought the album. I hardly ever buy CDs so this was pretty unusual. It's a great buy though, one of the only albums I listen to all the way through. The music is folky, catchy and gorgeous, but there's enough of a pop feel that it doesn't sound twee. Definitely a must buy for anyone with even a passing interest in traditional Irish music.
B000002N2N|5.0|At the beginning of Today Your Love, Tomorrow The World Dee-Dee says one,two,three four in German! Dee-dee being brought up in Germany and the song talking about Nazi facism it's really fitting! Dee-dee's background vocals add A LOT to the music that you don't really notice at first.
B000C65Z20|3.0|Very realistic action and interesting story but dragged in places and certain crucial information omitted. I feel some great scenes were left on cutting room floor.
B000127LW2|5.0|Am I the only one who wonders what Paramount is thinking?  Seriously I love star trek and I buy DVD TV seasons. LOTS of TV seasons I have all 8 seasons of Star Gate SG1 and lots of other TV shows. If Star Trek was a reasonable price like $50 or less then I'd buy it, heck I'd buy all the series except DS9 (just couldn't get into it) Too bad there isn't a way to tell paramount this.
B00062J00S|5.0|You feel needed. <br />It gives you hope. <br />Home is where the heart is. <br /> <br /> <br />Thank you
B00005O3VC|5.0|This is just a silly stupid movie for people with strange senses of humor. If you like movies such as Spaceballs you will like this movie as well. Its just senseless mindless fun. It does touch on some racy subject matters so I don't recommend it for younger children, but all in all its a great movie.
B00000K3CK|5.0|I enjoyed the movie. <br />It brought tears to my eyes. <br />It gives you a warm and cheerful feeling  <br />at the same time. <br /> <br />Thank you
B000AP2ZLC|5.0|I don't even know if I'm capable of putting how great this album is into words.  The musicianship is not just stunning, it's almost inhuman.  Cryptospy have further expanded more influences into their music by adding more and more elements from other genres, creating the most brutal, technical death metal known to man.  The influences found range anywhere from Classical to Jazz to Indie Rock.  There are even some nice acoustic passages in-between to add a colorful edge to the album.  Lord Worm isn't my favorate vocalist, but then again, I was never a fan of DiSalvo either.  I mostly listen to Cryptopsy for the amazing musicianship and brutality, though the vocals have always been an adequate addition to my listening experience whether is be DiSalvo or Lord Worm.  That's just me, I'm not too picky.  With all of that said, this is definately not something to sleep on whether you are a fan of Death Metal or just music in general.  If you want to see how far musicianship can be pushed, do yourself a favor by picking this up.
B00004XPPK|5.0|The first film I ever saw starring Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford, this 40s noir gem is just too hot and steamy for words!! Sure, the Production Code at the time prohibited any graphic or blatant sexual references, but the performances and innuendo more than make up for it.<br /><br />The rich black and white cinematography, wonderfully constructed sets, and Rita's dance numbers, as if that's not enough to take one's breath away. The strong, sensual heat generated between Hayworth and Ford is guaranteed to make you very hot beneath your collar. Was there ever a better portrayal of a sizzling love/hate entanglement?<br /><br />There is a hinted homosexual undertone in the relationship between sinister casino owner Ballin Mundson (George Macready) and his right-hand, Johnny Farrell (Ford), but as soon as Ballin's provocative new wife, Gilda (Hayworth) arrives on the scene, that pretty much goes out the window. The priceless expression on Johnny's face when he discovers that Mundson's bride and his ex-lover are one and the same (amid the famous hair-toss), is a moment that just cannot be beat. Ballin becomes all the more evil and controlling, at first only to Gilda (sensing that she and Johnny knew each other before), but then his bizarre business dealings and plans begin to unravel, leading to a great plot-twist.<br /><br />Gilda succeeds in arousing Johnny's jealousy through her flirtations with other men, while he tries to keep her supposedly \\"indecent\\" behavior from the boss. As much as he claims to despise her, it is obvious that neither one have gotten over the hurt of their \\"past association\\". When Johnny has the opportunity to punish her for what he believes to be her sinful behavior, the sparks between them go up another notch. Those slaps that they inflict on each other (love hurts!), and of course, Hayworth's famous \\"Put The Blame On Mame\\" mock striptease (dubbed by Anita Ellis) - that one will linger in your head for a long, long time. And that silky black dress - I think I speak for all of the viewing females when I say, I want that dress!!!<br /><br />With its subtly suggestive dialogue, magnificent performances and the gorgeous stars (who were close lifelong confidantes), \\"Gilda\\" is definitely deserving of its place in cinematic history.<br /><br />It would be nice to see \\"Affair In Trinidad\\" (1952) and \\"The Lady In Question\\" (1940), both of which paired Hayworth and Ford to have DVD releases. There's just not enough of their powerful chemistry to go around!!!r all of the viewing females when I say, I want that dress!!!    With its subtly suggestive dialogue, magnificent performances and the gorgeous stars (who were close lifelong confidantes), \\"Gilda\\" is definitely deserving of its place in cinematic history.

0131479415|5.0|Estimating software projects has always felt like voodoo magic. No matter how much the industry has tried to come up with reliable estimating schemes, it still seems like we mostly just pad our schedules and hope that pad will somehow be enough. Few estimating techniques genuinely account for the realities of business and the unpredictability that accompanies almost every software development project. Now, with Agile Estimating and Planning, you'll finally have the tools to tell management \\"how long is this going to take\\" without so much trepidation. I especially like how the book concentrates on separating size from duration.<br /><br />The book also does an excellent job of explaining how estimates fit into your overall project planning effort, providing specific insight into how to apply estimates during release planning, iteration planning, and daily planning. This guidance provides the reader with a complete roadmap of the full estimating lifecycle. Overall, Agile Estimating and Planning ends up equipping you with all the key elements you'll need to produce more reliable schedules.
B000BNI90O|5.0|This recording is a \\"must have\\" for fans of the music from the Lord Of the Rings films..I own the soundtracks from all 3 films and they are enjoyable, but they seem only a sampling after hearing this set. You can close your eyes and imagine each scene in the movie. The quality of the sound is beyond excellent.  I love the added bonus of having an additional recording on a DVD that lets you listen to the whole soundtrack without interruption. I am eagerly awaiting the complete recordings from \\"The Two Towers\\" and \\"The Return of the King\\".
0316172324|3.0|This is a funny book, a welcome reprieve from the day's terrible news.  It's worth reading, definitely; enjoyable.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Fantastic CD and an incredible band. I did notice something interesting though today as I was listening to the first track. Compare the bass line in \\"Is this it?\\" with the bass line in The Killers - \\"Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine\\". I think The Killers should kill their music stealing ways. But I guess if you're gonna steal, steal from the best.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|After seeing the Bourne Identity a time or two at a friends, I picked this up as part of a two pack. Oh man, best thing I've done in awhile. It measures up quite well to the first and keeps the action coming throughout the film. Only problem I've had (and several other people) has been the \\"shaky cam\\" experience. Yeah, someone should tell the director/cameraman to take some tylenol and sit. Anyways, other than that, good action movie. Not your average spy flick at all.
B000AYQJJ2|5.0|This is an exceptional document of the first benefit concert. The greatest stars of the moment, with the extraordinary George harrison on stage. smart dvd box.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|I would not consider myself a \\"fan\\" of the TV series \\"Firefly\\" (I saw several epsiodes when Fox first aired the show, and enjoyed it, but haven't seen the entire season), but I do enjoy Joss Wheadon's style, so I figured that I would enjoy \\"Serenity\\".<br /><br />I was not disappointed. Fun special effects and great space combat. A good time and well worth checking out.
B000002C25|5.0|Everyone says \\"not that good\\" \\"bloated\\". Sure it's kind of bloated, more like one or 2 songs that are bloated. I agree that \\"D'ya know what I mean\\" sucked horribly. I do not like it myself, it seems that the first 4 minutes of that song are absolutely incredible and then the guitar just absolutely ruins everything with their distorting effects and all that junk. But to say THIS album is junk just absolutely outlandish, let me prove you wrong. <br /> <br />Stand by me - One of Oasis's best songs. Constantly a concert rotation, and will make you shed a damn tear everytime. Packs a nice punch, Liam really sings his heart out on this track. <br /> <br />Don't go away - It's in the same category as Stand by me, no arrogance in these 2 songs but just ingenius songwriting and riffs, what rock and roll is about. <br /> <br />All around the world- This is what I wanted to write about. People accuse this song of being bloated, and just overproduced. This is Oasis at their best, no questions asked. You ask people to listen to this song for the full 10 minutes, this song never gets weak and it carries it's melodies throughout the song. Near the 5 minute mark the song starts to hit it's climax when Liam starts \\"nanana\\"'ing. The best part of this song is where they eventually hit the La's and rock out till the end. Who said Rock and Roll is about lyrics? It's about playing your emotions and letting other people feel that emotion. To tell me that you can listen to all around and not feel the band's hard work and constantly strive for perfection in this one song is useless. You can feel Noel riding his guitar, You can feel McGuigan abusing those drums and you can feel Liam shouting and singing his @$$ off.  <br /> <br />This is oasis at their best, Best album of theirs? No, that's morning glory. This is a definite tie with Definitely Maybe as their 2nd best album, sales and charting prove it. <br /> <br />Prove me wrong.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|To me, AOR is more universal. I find different aspects of life in this album. Judas Rising, Deal with the Devil, Hellrider are magnificent, Worth Fighting For is fascinating, Angel is romantic, Eulogy is deep and Lockness is a symphony that expresses all my fears ! Demonizer, Wheels of Fire are also ok. So, what can I want more ? How many groups on earth can show this superior performance at 50's ? <br /> <br />AOR is worth buying for, worth listening for and worth living for ! <br />Looking forward for the next... <br />
0385338686|4.0|its like 4.5 bc it wasnt perfect..which is hard. looove this book ok at first (i love the author and ive read the shopaholic series and can you keep a secret) so at first i was not as happy..it started off a bit slow but i got so into it. wow ok its really funny and theres parts where the lines are hilarious..all kinsellas characters are! great, fun book!
B000001DTM|5.0|Easily U2's finest hour.  This record is much more interesting to me than Joshua Tree.  It's refreshing to see that U2 was not afraid to try something totally different.  After all they had a successful formula with their anthemic arena rock style going for them in the 80's.  Here they tear all of that down with a wrecking ball.  You can immediately sense a transformation from the first opening bars of Zoo Station.  I'd have to say that this is definitely some of the Edge's best work.  If I could achieve his guitar sound during his solo on The Fly I would salivate at the mouth...Bono is very convincing here as well.  He sounds like he's having a party on songs like Even Better than the Real Thing & Mysterious Ways, but also sings with such feeling and compassion on songs like One & So Cruel.  Easily one of the best record's of the 90's.
B000BMSTMS|1.0|Doesn't it bother anybody that songwriters for Britney Spears, Hilary Duff, and Avril Lavigne contributed to this album? In particular, the ones who wrote \\"Sk8er Boi\\" and \\"Complicated\\"? <br /> <br />I'm talking about The Matrix, a music production team that engineers hit singles and co-wrote this album. In other words, you aren't really listening to Korn, you're listening to Scott Spock, Lauren Christy and Graham Edwards. <br /> <br />I'm not sure you can get any closer to selling out than that.
0684824906|5.0|During my 60 years I have read a dozen or more biographies of Lincoln whom I have found always a fascinating subject.  He lives in all of us Americans.  We should listen to him better. <br /> <br />Ms. Goodwin brings us very close to Lincoln and his cabinet members with many intimate pictures of their family lives and conversations with each other.  Much has been culled from letters and diaries.  She seems to have a great knowledge of previously published biographies and avoids repeating the familiar stories and historical details. <br /> <br />A long, deeply thoughtful meditation in this book.  I recommend it most highly.

B000AWYOGE|1.0|There is a lesson to be learned, here---bad architecture and bad plumbing do not a scary movie make.    Having such accommodations can be very depressing for the people who have to live with them,  but as the basis for a horror movie,  this is, shall we say, \\"inadequate\\".    Jennifer Connelly is an appealing actress, but she garners nothing from this movie role except a heavy dousing of brackish, brown-colored water.  The talents of John C. Reilly--a fine actor in other contexts--are equally wasted here.  I haven't a clue as to why he took this role.    That stain on the ceiling that Connelly's character finds in her apartment--the one that looks more and more like a malignant melanoma... it's telling you to avoid this movie.  Stop watching.  Put on your latex gloves and flee!  It is a sign that the makers of the movie have no imagination... and that these pea-brains will soon be clogging the toilets and sending cascades of  sewage down the walls,  because... that's the best they could do, folks...
B000A59PMO|5.0|This show is one of the smartest and most enjoyable series out there.  It really irks me that they have to compete with Lost at 9pm on Wednesdays.  I feel both shows are better than most of the garbage reality series out there.  If you want a dvd set that will keep you guessing and make you laugh, then Veronica Mars is for you. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
B00000K3CK|5.0|This is One of the biggest christmas classics of all time.. It's a christmas tradtion in my house to sit and watch this movie with the family.. Who can forget Mr. Shellhammertell Mrs. Walker \\"He's a born Salesman...I can Feel it!!!!\\" I know it's a little goofy but Nothing better then Christmas time a couple of drinks and making fun of some of the lines in the movie...

Spartan 117 and his comrades must stop the Covenant forces. Only he will survive the onslaught.<br /><br />Sounds like every other sci-fi book because it is. There is no beaming or time traveling but it is held in the future and the context is ahead of our time. (End of paragraph 1)<br /><br />I enjoyed this story because it is a story of heroes with few or no choice; they had to do things that are unimaginable. I recommend this book to someone who is serious and understands the concept of war, definitely twelve years old or up. There are not a lot of jokes and a heck of a lot of death in this book. (End of paragraph 2)<br /><br />A major twist that surprised me was when Sam was injured in combat and chose to kill himself by detonating the nukes that were planted. I expected Sam to go out guns blazing and taking down Grunts. Suicide was not an option I expected him to choose.<br /><br />The people who would enjoy this book are people who have played Halo (the game) and wish to know more about the Halo Universe. It is a great book for information about how they found Halo and the major space battles that took place. One of my friends who had wanted to read this book had not even heard of Halo. I told him that unless he understood the plot and played the game he should not read this book.<br /><br />The reason I like science fiction is that even though the stuff is fictional it is approached in such scientific procedure that is appears to be plausible. In this book you are taught how the plasma weapons and slip space-jumping works, giving it a realistic feel not as though it was created from imagination. If the book did not have reasoning or information about how the actions could happen I probably would have not enjoyed it as much.o be plausible.

For all of you who have seen the film \\"The Ring\\", think of it as a videotaped \\"King In Yellow\\" - beware the Yellow Sign, lest your reputation become beyond repair!
B000ANXLB2|3.0|Sound quality: excellent. Performances: excellent, what we would expect from Karajan and the BPO. Visuals: dreadful. Now I am sure it is very difficult to film symphonic music and in some ways these films are enjoyable to watch. But I cannot understand why we have to see the conductor's face and hands for 90% of the time. We never see the faces of the wind, brass, timpani or percussion players and this horrified me. These people have extremely prominent parts in Beethoven's music yet they are dehumanised in the films. When the principal oboe plays the long theme at the beginning of the Eroica's funeral march, what do we see? Karajan's face. Surely, since this performance is not in a concert hall, it would have been possible for us to see the oboist. Likewise in the long introduction to the Fourth, all we see is Karajan's face. The worst of all is the Sixth. Richard Osborne in his biography of Karajan calls this film \\"an offence against music\\" and I utterly agree. It is almost sickening to watch (but not to listen to). Roger Vaughan in his biography tells us that Karajan's idea was to give the impression that the instruments make music by themselves, and that we should never lose sight of the conductor. But music is written by humans, for humans, and to be played by humans. Everything in these films points to the conductor. Even in the finale of the Ninth, when the soloists return at the end, we only have a glimpse of them as they sing their poco adagio, then it is all back to Karajan. How the orchestra coped all those years facing him with his eyes closed I cannot imagine. It is refreshing to see him open them in the vocal sections of the Ninth: he actually looks human. Certainly he was a superb conductor and got magnificent results from players and singers, but I suspect I will play these performances with my eyes averted from the screen. The only technical hitch of all is that on my copy of the DVD of the Eroica, the first bar of the funeral march is missing.

B000BYA5GO|3.0|Well made drama is heavy handed.  Cage's character focus on \\"work\\" to the demise of everything else in his life is of interest, but the overall message of the film feels a bit one sided.
B00008972S|5.0|West Side Story is, of course, a masterpiece.The documentary disc accompanying the feature film, remarkably, is as inspiring as the movie itself. The story of the collaboration between the creative geniuses and performers who made this classic could stand on its own merits. Outstanding!
B00012QM8G|5.0|Schindlers List is a cinematic masterpiece.  It has all the elements that make a movie great ie. great acting, good story & suspense.  This movie is the story of Oscar Schindler who's greed helped him to begin a manufacturing business which exploited cheap jewish labor for his own benefit.  Through the movie his greed dissipates and humanity surfaces to the point where he continues the company only to help jews from ending up in concentration camps.  Even though the movie is over 3 hours long it flows nicely and you do not get bored with it.  I recommend showing this movie in schools to ensure students understand the gravity of the holocaust.  Overall great movie.
B000001DTM|4.0|Nothing beats The Joshua Tree and Rattle and Hum for U2.  This is the next release after Rattle and Hum and comes closest to rival Joshua Tree.  Their popularity was on a quick rise after Rattle and Hum and Achtung Baby just brought U2 to absolute main stream.  Great tunes, great songs.  Definitely worth the buy.  Definitely most artistic album I think.
B000E97X66|5.0|This release could easily be construed as a cynical grab for cash coming so soon after the DVD of the same show was released as part of the 30th anniverary Born to Run box set.  <br /> <br />That aside the fact that we have a release from this previously (commercially)unmined period of Springsteen's live career is cause for celebration.  <br /> <br />Springsteen is one of the most bootlegged artists going around and this particular show has been circulated on numerous occasions. Few versions however can match this one for quality. Taken directly from the mastering and mixing efforts of Bob Ludwig and Clearmountain that featured on the DVD it has a crisp sound that captures the historic debut performance of Springsteen and the E Street band in London. <br /> <br />As for the show itself it is a classic.  <br />Bruce arrived in town less than pleased about the media hype and backlash that came with the release of Born to Run. Pre-show he was tearing down his own flyers in disgust. This translated into a high energy show that, lets be honest, is typical of most every Springsteen show.  <br /> <br />The artwork is virtually a retread of what came with the DVD which is a little disappointing and features the same liner notes written by Springsteen as well. <br /> <br />So it's nothing new. That's not the point. If it sells there is incentive for Bruce and the record company to continue to mine the rich vault of live performances and provide us with furure releases. Can you say \\"Springsteen:the live bootleg series\\"? <br /> <br />Don't buy it for Bruce....don't buy it for Sony.....buy it for yourself. <br />
B000001F3C|4.0|War is the beginning of the super stardom for U2.  After this EP was put out it has been mostly all up hill for the musical career of U2.  Great album, great tunes, and if you are interested in messages in your songs or not it has all that too.  Not necessarily a must have but worth the buy.
B000BYCAJE|4.0|While the songs on CSN's first LP have always been a bit inconsistent, the album contains a number of classics (e.g. Suite Judy Blue Eyes, Long Time Gone) that remain strong and unique to the present.  The extra songs are more interesting than great, but Everybondy's Talkin' is very enjoyable and a nice addition to the canon (if not quite as wonderful as their demo acousic version of the Beatles'/McCartney's \\"Blackbird\\" released a few years ago).   What some of the other reviewers miss, perhaps, is that the strength of the album as a whole lies in its \\"sound\\" as opposed to the strength or weakness of any individual song.  I remember when I heard this as a 15 year old for the first time with my friends and we are all stunned.  Nothing in rock sounded anything remotely like it, due both to the harmonies and the production (as well as Stills' muliple contributions and overdubbing) and nothing else (including CSN's or CSN&Y's subsequent work) still does.  And it is the sound that links all the songs and makes the album a \\"whole.\\"  For most baby boomers as well as younger folk who like someone like Elliot Smith's music, this album certainly should still be a staple in anyone's collection.

B000BYA5G4|4.0|This sharp, incisive, and darkly funny movie about the career of a Ukrainian born American gunrunner was probably too cynical to find acceptance with a general audience.  Its central character is an amoral, conscience-challenged arms dealer who finds it impossible to leave his chosen profession no matter the cost to himself or the people around him because \\"he's good at it\\".     Despite all of Nicholas Cage's inherent charm, this guy is hard to like, especially as the progress of the film will demonstrate his gaining the world and losing his soul and everything else that matters to him.  Films with disturbing protaganists usually don't do well, and judging by a lot of the negative reviews I see here, I think this was a prime example of that response.    Most Americans probably don't even recognize or contemplate the fact that our government is the largest arms dealer in the world.  Followed of course, as pointed out in the movie, by all the rest of the UN Security Council (China, France, Great Britain, Russia).      You can take the stance that Nic Cage's Yuri does in the film of \\"if I don't do it someone else will\\" or you can wonder would any of the suffering of, especially, the third world be relieved if arms dealing wasn't so easy, prevalent, and cheap.  Yuri is not sociopathic as many have labeled him in their reviews, he is doggedly amoral.  He takes no sides, he deals to whoever has the cash.  His chief rival admonishes him that he must take sides.  But is that any real option or just more of the same rationale to assauge one's conscience?    At any rate, I for one wasn't bored, and I found the writing sharp and insightful and fascinating as it recounts in dispassionate detail the rise of a world class arms dealer.  Extremely well played by Cage, he somehow remains detached from the consequences of his actions for a long while, until all the dark and cynical humor coalesces in the end to a detailing of the harsh tragedy the trade really engenders.    The writer/director has created a stylish piece that actually bites into a subject worth thinking about, and takes us into a ruthless and cold world we know little about. Recommended for those wanting something different. 4-1/2 stars.

Its a testement to everyone who worked on the film, from Errol all the way down.  Great acting, great fight scenes, great sets, great costumes and of course a rousing score.  The extras are great too, espcially the behind the scenes footage and the blooper reel.  And you get two Warner Brothers cartoons to boot.

4789009637|5.0|At first I briefly toyed with the idea of giving Genki 4 stars rather than 5 because of the self-motivation aspect that is critical to its effectiveness, but then I realized that would be a meaningless depreciation of its actual worth to the potential buyer. If you're NOT self-motivated to learn Japanese (or any other language for that matter) STOP reading this review and, for heaven's sake, STOP wasting your time on shopping for books/CDs/DVDs/software/etc. that have no function other than to provide aid. There is not a medium in existence that is going to miraculously self-help you help yourself learn Japanese!<br /><br />The bottomline is it doesn't matter how \\"fun\\", \\"funny\\", or \\"FANTASTIC\\" a tool is, it won't do a lick of good if you don't have some tiny shred of drive or passion to S-T-U-D-Y, whether that implies listening to a CD while sitting in 5 PM traffic; doing all of your assigned homework in a class; or even simply attempting to order dinner at a foreign restaurant without using your native tongue.<br /><br />So, that being said, I found Genki to be perhaps the BEST introductory textbook to the Japanese language. It has 12 well-organized lessons that gradually lead you into the complex world of Japanese word allocations. Each lesson is arranged into four parts:<br /><br />(1) DIALOGUE<br /><br />This is where an exchange is set up between two or more of Genki's sample characters in a straighforward--albeit, totally cheesy and insipid--script. The most important thing to note here is that if you mistaken this section of the lesson to be the \\"Useful Everyday Phrases\\" equivalent found in some other reference books, then you deserve to be giggled at sideways by your local exchange student.<br /><br />The dialogue conversations are pointedly written to introduce new grammar structures and vocabulary words; they are no better written than those ridiculously staged \\"Say No to Drugs\\" movies that we've all suffered through in grade school or, for that matter, ANY textbook-scripted interaction. Let's face it, here. Nothing's going to teach real-life dialogue except real-life. However, I should note that having to recite and repeat the Genki dialogues after listening to the audio greatly helped me find a good feel for the cadence and flow of standard spoken Japanese.<br /><br />(2) VOCABULARY<br /><br />Every lesson of Genki introduces about 20-40 new nouns, 10-20 new verbs, and about 10-30 miscellaneous other words such as adjectives, adverbs, or expressions. Though it is true some of the terms may only be useful to college students/young adults [e.g., \\"shukudai\\"--homework; \\"gakki\\"--semester; \\"benkyou suru\\"--to study] the vast majority of the list consists of basic, everyday words I couldn't imagine any beginning learner living without [e.g., \\"shigoto\\"--job; \\"imouto\\"--little sister; \\"byouin\\"--hospital; \\"noru\\"--to ride/to board; \\"tabako wo suu\\"--to smoke (cigarettes, etc.)]<br /><br />(3) GRAMMAR<br /><br />The grammar section breaks down the complex linguistic structure of Japanese without convoluting its explanations or otherwise overwhelming the beggining learner with overly in-depth assessments of why A goes here and B goes there. Obviously, Japanese is a very intricate language, it doesn't help that it's so vastly diverse from English. Genki takes a \\"crawl before walk\\" approach by sacrificing technical explanations for more practical examples that slowly warm learners to the IDEAS rather than the rationalizations. Now, this may drive some of you linguistics nerds and grammar nazis crazy *because it certainly did me* but for an introductory level textbook, it does the job.<br /><br />(4) PRACTICE<br /><br />The last part of each lesson includes 6-10 pages of exercises that directly correlate with the preceding vocabulary and grammar sections. The only failings here include the fact that there are no answers in the back of the book and, of course, the textbook doesn't come with a living, breathing human being to practicethe two-person exercises. This is definitely a setback to consider if you are truly pursuing the language completely solo.<br /><br />***I would also highly recommend picking up the companion workbook as it offers additional exercises and practice space that also directly correlate with the lessons in the text.***<br /><br />Also, one of the best things about Genki is the utter lack of romaji or as they say \\"romanized Japanese\\". Ask any good Japanese-language learner and they will tell you the faster you shed the habit of thinking about Japanese in the English phonetic alphabet the better off you will be. Genki did me a great service by forcing this dangerous crutch out from under me by removing all traces of it by Lesson 3. But don't let this daunt you, if you follow along with the hiragana/katakana practice in the back of the book (or invest in the workbook), you will be well prepared for the change.pursuing the language completely solo.    ***I would also highly recommend picking up the companion workbook as it offers additional exercises and practice space that also directly correlate with the lessons in the text.***     Also, one of the best things about Genki is the utter lack of romaji or as they say \\"romanized Japanese\\".

Now having listened to it, the stars of track and field, and Judy and her dream of horses, for me, are really the radio-worthy listenable catchy tunes. The stuff in between is, you know, indie-shlock, blah blah twangy nothingness. Though, don't get me wrong, would be very suitable for say, trying to seduce 20 something, depressed, slightly higher than average IQ, lonely, journal keeping, liberal arts degree program dropouts. (note: For Engineering degree dropouts, DEVO Hardcore Vol.2 suits this purpose) Oh, and hey, what's the deal with the singer? He sounds like a disaffected English guy with a cleft palate and a hare lip, who has a predeliction for baby talk. Don't get me wrong though, it really works on those two songs!

B00005JOII|3.0|...still not that great. By anyone else, this would be an interesting little film. Perhaps we expect a bit more from Woody.    There are a number of problems with the film. Though the change of location from Allen's usual Manhattan initially sounds refreshing, Allen makes a bit of a rod for his own back here. He doesn't understand the nuances of Britain - the language is still very New York (a Scottish policeman calling someone a 'schmuck'!?). He also fails to pick up on the class aspect of British culture too. The main character is supposed to be an Irish lad who has a working class background, yet he sounds more plummy than Queen Elizabeth (surprisingly, Jonathan Rhys Myers is actually Irish). Also, this same character who has no formal schooling, appears to like Opera and read Dostoyevski. I'm not being funny, but how does a 20 something who hasn't been to private school or posh university supposed to get into these things in passing? Maybe this was the sort of thing young people did in the 60's or 70's (I am assuming, as I wasn't there), but today?     The key idea at the heart of the film is the idea of luck, and inparticular, how lucky the main character is. Unfortunatley, this feels a little tacked on in the film, much as it was in Melinda and Melinda. 'Luck' appears every now and then in the film, but not enough to form the main theme. The main character's luck turns to bad at one point in the film, made dramatically clear by a ring being thrown into the river Thames, but calamatously bouncing back off a railing. But the bad luck doesn't last for long, and he soon bounces back on top. So what is the point of drawing attention to his luck changing if it had no effect on the outcome of the film?    Some have suggested here that the film is a good commentary on Dostoevsky, and I'll admit that if this is so, it is something I missed, mostly because I haven't read him. Perhaps it is good commentary, but at best if it was it would be one layer to an otherwise mostly flawed film. And it would also be an element that escaped most reviewers when the film came out.    But the film is quite exciting, once you get past the first half hour. The last half hour is a particular shock, and completely unexpected. But there are other films that have covered similar ground before (see much of Allen's back catalouge), and covered it better. In terms of an amoral character doing what he beleives is 'neccesary', The Talented Mr Ripley is a far better film. Match Point is fairly missable.
B0007TKNII|5.0|Occasionally, a film is so bad that it rightfully deserves to be panned by audiences and critics alike. At other times, an incredibly well made film is poorly received, a fact that is both shocking and dismaying. Joel Schumacher's \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" falls into the second category. This movie is, in a word, incredible. It's a pure sight and sound musical fantasy, grandiose in scope and delightfully over the top in drama and romance. Rarely have I found myself completely absorbed in a film; it left me unable to concentrate on anything afterwards other than it's highly memorable and effective score, composed with great gusto by Andrew Lloyd Webber. It's just the kind of music that has the ability to stay in your head long after leaving the theater (stage or screen). That's something I definitely look for in a musical.<br /><br />Based on the blockbuster London and Broadway stage musical (which itself was based on the novel \\"Le Fantôm de l'Opera\\" by Gaston Leroux), the story of \\"Phantom\\" can basically be described as a gothic love triangle. Christine (Emmy Rossum), a beautiful and naïve young girl is torn between her childhood sweetheart and a mysterious figure who honed her ability to sing. There are definite upsides to both men: Raoul (Patrick Wilson) is charming and handsome, and he can look back on his childhood days with Christine with happiness; the Phantom (Gerard Butler), despite the fact that he's disfigured and sliding into madness, is seductive and overpowering, and he has the ability to ignite Christine's lust. By the end of the film, she realizes that choosing either one will require making a great sacrifice.<br /><br />A series of subplots work their way into the film, the most prominent being the rivalry between Christine and Carlotta (Minnie Driver), a boisterous, temperamental Italian diva with a comically over-exaggerated singing voice. Christine clearly has nothing against her; I can't even recall a moment when they speak to each other. Carlotta, on the other hand, hates Christine with a passion, and absolutely refuses to let a younger, prettier, more talented girl upstage her. She never understands just how ridiculous her feelings for Christine are, even after the Phantom humiliates Carlotta by lacing her throat spray with a voice disabling substance. And he proves to be just as stubborn with his feelings: he won't let anyone upstage Christine, and if he has to kill a few people to prove his point, then so be it.<br /><br />Along the way, we also meet: Andre and Firmin (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds and Simon Callow), the Opera Populaire's newest managers who only care about their financial success; Madame Giry (Miranda Richardson), the Ballet Mistress who knows more about the Phantom than she initially let's on; and Meg Giry (Jennifer Ellison), Madame Giry's daughter and Christine's best friend. They weave in and out of the story fairly evenly, and in some way, they all play a part in the main plot (some play bigger parts than others). Out of all these characters, the only one I took issue with was Madame Giry. Why is she the only one with a French accent when every character in this film lives in France? I realize this is just nitpicking, and it's really not a big enough problem to ruin the story (but it is still noticeable).<br /><br />As paper-thin and clich&eacute; as the plot may sound, it's such classic material that it lends itself perfectly to an operatic musical. The romance is also effectively enhanced by the lyrics, written with care and precision by Charles Hart (with additional lyrics written by Richard Stilgoe). Never once did they seem contrived or ill fitting (and this is after they were altered from their original stage incarnations). It just goes to show that a memorable song is about more than just a catchy tune; it needs to work with its words, as well.<br /><br />One of the criticisms that overshadowed this film was Gerard Butler's performance (acting and singing). Granted, the Phantom issupposed to represent a twisted father figure for Christine, and that does necessitate an older, more established actor. However, this film adaptation was clearly attempting to reinvent his character, and for that reason, a younger, fresher actor suited the film perfectly. As far as his singing voice is concerned, I've actually read reviews that likened it to a low-grade high school production. Are they kidding me? He may not have the greatest voice in the world, but it's nowhere near as bad as some have made it out to be. In my opinion, he effectively manages to carry through the songs. In other words: I never once disliked the decision made to cast him in this film.<br /><br />One of the pivotal (and best) scenes is of the Phantom leading Christine through the underground catacombs and into his lair during the title song. It was meant to be a surreal, dreamlike descent; some of the imagery, including living arms that act as sconces, wouldn't make sense under lucid circumstances. But Christine is in a trance, susceptible to an active imagination. The audience feels this, as well, by means of some very unconventional methods. But since it's a moment of pure fantasy, it's perfectly acceptable for huge candelabra to magically rise from the waters and for the music to include electric guitar solos and synthesized drumbeats. While this may initially come off as historically inaccurate, it still manages to fit with the tone of the story. Besides, Webber himself says that the music was designed to have a slight rock 'n' roll feel to it, if not for the story, then for the sake of connecting it with a modern audience.<br /><br />Few musicals have had me as entranced as \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" has. From the songs to the performances to the bold set and costume designs, it can take you away to a different world. That's probably one of the corniest ways to describe a film, but in this case, it's really the only one that fits. And it's true what some have said: if you loved the play, then you'll love the movie. So what if it was unsuccessful at the box office? Who cares if the critics completely missed the point? We now have it on DVD, and in the privacy of our homes, no one can tell us what makes a movie good or bad.hristine, and that does necessitate an older, more established actor.

B000001FS6|4.0|Review number 101. Superb follow-up to their 1987 masterpiece 'Joshua Tree' album. Liked both the movie as well as the awesome soundtrack here. As huge a fan of live releases that I am, I simply could not get enough of this CD's live tunes, \\"Helter Skelter\\", \\"All Along The Watchtower\\", the (sometimes) tear-jerker \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" and \\"Bullet The Blue Sky\\". The studio tracks are equally as good. Even after umpteen years of it's original release, 'Rattle And Hum' is MORE than able to stand the harsh test of time. An absolute must-have.
B00005NTJM|5.0|\\"This Was\\" is my favorite Tull album...I also like \\"Stand Up\\" equally well, but you have to go with the first. Obviously, I prefer the \\"old\\" Tull of bluesy, jazzy, minstrelly, troubadour sounding music. I'm not a big \\"Cat's Squirrel\\" fan, but there are some great guitar licks on that \\"feature the band\\" composition. The other songs on this album are ALL fine examples of great, basic jazz or blues. Ian uses a harp a little more often on this album and he's quite good; and, in my mind, his flute playing is also very good on this album (even better on \\"Stand Up\\") This isn't  the same guitarist as the  later, more popular aqua lung days, but he just seems to have more to \\"say\\" and is thankfully featured a little more often. We all must remember that this album came out in early '68 and is totally listenable today. I'm not sure how anyone can  dislike this album...maybe they are used to the later stuff, which, except for a couple individual songs, I really couldn't get into (so, maybe I'm the odd one?). But who cares? This album from first song to last is great...again, this is one of those albums that I've always had in one form or another...Over the almost 40 years of its existence, I've listened to this album well over a  1000 times! I must admit that maybe 497 times I skipped \\"Cat's Squirrel\\", but that's all!
0553801503|4.0|If these people actually existed, this might be an interesting book. As it is, the author's favorite technique to describe a person is by creating 8 new characters related to him and tell some tale about them. The only problem is, these characters then must continue to exist. And in fact, they do get reused here and there, again and again. My recommendation to anyone who hasn't started the series is to wait until the series is over (say around 2025), then read them one after another. What I needed was an encyclopedia of characters, to tell me what I already knew from the first three books but had long forgotten. Now, which one is the Hound and which is the Mountain? And which of the Starks are really truly dead (not to mention their wolves)? And remind me again of who Tyrion really did kill, please. <br /> <br />Drinking game: every time you hit the word \\"sweetling\\", take a drink. Expect to wake up with a headache, especially after any Sansa chapter. <br /> <br />That said, the book is otherwise readable and enjoyable. Like reading a Russian novel, just skip over the names you don't recognize and don't worry too much about who did what to whom. Go with the flow; with the next book not out until (I'm guessing) 2007, you're going to again forget who's who by then anyway. <br /> <br />With \\"A Dance With Dragons\\" looking to be 1200-1300 pages with 5 major characters, I suspect the publisher will split this volume in two again. Will we ever get past this part of the history?

I gave Ludlum 4 stars and give this one 5 for two reasons; Archer's book is an easier read and the hero of his book is around long enough to care about.<br /><br />Thought to be a traitor, Gerald Scott resigned his commission from the army. When he died, he had little to leave his family, other than the taint of that resignation and an unopened letter from a Nazi war criminal. Adam, his son, inherits the letter and takes a simple one day trip to Switzerland to retrieve the contents of a bank box the letter refers to. From that moment on, Adam's life is anything but simple. Chased by the Americans, the Russians, the Swiss and the British, and unaware of the secret he's got in his possession, Adam has to get to safety. First, he has to solve the mystery of his inheritance, figure out where safety is and who he can trust, and manage to stay alive doing it all.<br /><br />The secret itself seems a tad silly, but other than that, the story is fast-paced and very easy to follow, putting it a little bit above some overly convoluted thrillers I've read.<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBooks

0140277447|5.0|This book talks about one of most heinous acts ever committed by humanity.  The author backs up these stories with a variety of stories which gives validity to her claims.  She uses graphic imagery that allows the reader to somewhat understand the atrocities executed by these men who truly acted as animals.  This is definitely one of the most well written books I have ever read.  I think it is a book that people should read because if we forget what happened at Nanking history is bound to repeat itself.

Speaking of sound, I don't think I have ever heard a recorded orchestra sounding so true, so \\"there\\". Kudos to the WDR engineers for an outstanding job. As Classics Today's David Hurtz said: get this set before it disappears!

It is as creative as Star Trek, as clever as those Robert Redford-Paul Newman bait and switch capers, beautifully filmed, full of surprises, peopled with wonderful characters.  And you feel good, at the end of the each episode.  It's just superb.
B000BYRCH4|3.0|I'm not a big Paul Walker fan and I'd have Jessica Biel before Jessica Alba any day but having said that, I found this to be a very enjoyable film and think it was unduly ripped apart by so called professional critics on it's release. To be honest being a massive fan of The Deep with the late great Robert Shaw, Nick Nolte and the stunning (at the time) Jacqueline Bisset I didn't think I'd enjoy this at all as I thought I'd be comparing it all the way through but Into The Blue stands on it's own all be it with a similar plot to The Deep. Also of note is the underwater photography which is beautiful and even more so with Jessica Alba swimming around in it! Ignore the critic's, give it a chance and you'll find an enjoyable piece of escapism for it's 100 minute running time. Definitly one I'll be purchasing.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|So the concept of actors doing their own singing may not have started here, but here is a classic example of where they got it right.  You think that Phoenix and Witherspoon did great chanelling living legends, then take a gander at Kidman and McGregor creating legends out of thin air.  Kidman is great with her sultry tones and breathy delivery of Madonna's 'Material Girl' or her elegant 'One Day I'll Fly Away', all of which pitch perfect just as in the movie, but it's Ewan who really steals the show.  He soars, takes his voice beyond anything I expected in songs like 'Come What May' which is the beautiful theme song sung duet with Miss Kidman and his verse towards the end of 'Roxane' where he steals the song out from under Jose Feliciano and Jacek Koman feet and holds on tight.  Other vocal talents lent their voice, such as the much talked about Lady Marmalade cover staring Lil' Kim, Mya, Miss Aguliera and Pink as well as David Bowie lending his voice to 2 versions of Nature Boy (although I like Celine Dions version better)  Fatboy slims reinvention of the Can Can is entertaining, but replay value is low unless your at a party.  No, it's the subtlety in songs like 'Your Song' and as I mentioned the beautiful 'Come What May' that stand out as the highlights of this soundtrack.  Give it a try, Ewan and Nicole worked damn hard for this.
0920668372|1.0|I purchased this book for my sons after having read the first few pages.  The beginning is achingly sweet.  Upon our arrival home, my wife got out the book to read to our two-year-old.  The book gets strange fast.  We found ourselves struggling not to react negatively when \\"Mommy\\" is shown driving across town in the dead of night with a ladder on the roof of her station wagon.  Her intent?  A little nocturnal Breaking and Entering into her now-adult son's home so she can rock him in her arms.  Are you kidding me?  Ee[...]   Then we continue on to the part where Mommy is now on Death's door and too weak to sneak around.  So naturally, Sonny boy visits his mother to rock her in his arms.  You get the impression that she then dies so he goes home to rock his infant daughter. Yikes.  What a shame.  This book could have been really wonderful.  Instead, it went directly into the trash.  I had never before envisioned myself relegating a book to the trash heap but in this case, it seemed important.
0895260131|5.0|This book was spellbinding in its methodical exposure of the literal translation of the Quran and how it has driven Islamists' behavior for over 1000 years. My \\"Aha\\" moment: Radical Islam might be better expressed as Literal Islam.  <br /> <br />Mr. Spencer takes care to point out that your new knowledge of literal Islam is not necessarily being taught to the average Muslim - and therefore it is not OK to presume that the Muslims you know are driven by the \\"US vs THEM\\" exhortations of the Quran. <br /> <br />Even if it is a small percentage indeed of Muslims who respond to the call of Jihad, that small percentage could mean millions of people. This Clear and Present Danger is why this book should be read by every freedom-loving citizen in the world. <br /> <br />I purchased the audio CDs, narrated by the talented Jeff Riggenbach. I am buying the paperback version so that I can refer to Mr. Spencer's library of \\"books you're not supposed to read\\". The Mister and I are buying more of the CDs for the Chief of Police in our city, the Sheriff of our county, and the parents of our grandkids.  <br /> <br />Sharing this book is a way we can fight back. If you own The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam... please pass it on!
B000BCE918|4.0|Of course the main reason to buy this complete set is that it is a better value than just buying the first Jurassic Park movie by itself. The second and third movies in the series were always also-rans to the original in my opinion, and were made by the studio to capitalize on the brand name of the first. However, the other two are above average action adventure movies, and for the combined cost of the three are worth it.<br />The main course will always be the first movie. The biggest attraction of this film back in 1993, of course, was the realistic computer graphic animation of the dinosaurs by SGI, and the good use of suspense built around them. 13 years ago nothing like it had ever been done. This is hard to remember when the Discovery Channel now has the whole \\"Walking with ...\\" series of documentaries on dinosaurs, early man, and creatures before the dinosaur that use the same techniques that this film did, and thus people have become accustomed to this level of realism in animation. Thus with the \\"shock value\\" of the animation removed, even the original Jurassic Park movie doesn't seem quite as \\"5-star\\" as it did during its first run. The dialogue, in particular, seems a bit thin now. One aspect of the movie that still impresses me that doesn't get much mention is the outstanding use of sound and sound effects. For example, when the T-Rex first appears in the movie, it is not just the sight of the thing that terrifies, but its tremendous roar. The Jurassic Park movies are still good action adventure viewing for the entire family, and the extras on how the movie was made are very interesting too.
1400049628|5.0|This is more of a gag than it is a novel but it was still pretty good. It was written as though the zombie genre is real and is more of a reference or 'how to' manual for someone that believes in such things. It is thorough on the subject and I enjoyed reading it.

1582432678|4.0|This novel is compelling--I'm among the many who couldn't put it down.  It has an aftertaste that lingers long after you finally finish--vaguely unpleasant but still something you want again.   <br /> <br />Shriver's writing is amazing.  The voice is bit pretentious, bordering on annoying--but consistent with the character.  Her storyline wavers near the middle.  It starts strong, but starts marching into a fairly predictable downward spiral about halfway through.  I predicted the \\"twist\\" and wished with all my heart to be wrong because it was just too predictable.   <br /> <br />I don't believe the author agrees with the idea that some kids are \\"born bad\\".  Shriver gives evidence to support both sides of the \\"nature v. nurture\\" debate, but the \\"nurture\\" side isn't well represented.  We don't get any voice but the mother's.  The father, sister, teacher, physician--heck, even Kevin!--are undeveloped and flat. <br /> <br />Shriver alludes to \\"attachment disorder\\" and her protagonist questions her parenting ability, but this is all viewed in a vacuum.  Without other voices, we get a disjointed, incomplete picture.   <br /> <br />The entire collection of \\"letters\\" seems like a series of self portraits taken in a broken mirror.  It's imperfect, and frustrating, and probably not entirely accurate--but it captures what the hero sees and how she feels.   <br /> <br />It's heartbreaking and yet not that difficult to imagine that this is how mothers really feel when their kids commit atrocities.

B00079018K|3.0|First off, the music is great.  My roomie won't stop playing her copy of the CD. At times, it sounds weirdly as if Chemical Brothers used guitars instead of turntables.  I like these songs a whole heck of a bunch and I am glad to see the lads getting much love.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Now, to the disagreement.  Sorry, \\"Duran Fan\\", but format &lt;em>does&lt;/em> matter.  You might as well be telling people to give up their vinyl with your arguments.  If Sony and other companies continue the asinine (and pointless) \\"mine, mine, mine\\" MO, they will start to actually lose the monies that they claim to be.  I, for one, will NOT buy a copy of this CD or any other that limits the way I can play music I have paid for.<br /><br />I download quite a number of songs a week.  I share that music with friends and family. It's called word of mouth, people, and it sells records.  (Ahem, CDs.  Nobody's heard of records lately.)  I also buy about 20 CDs worth of music a month-through iTunes, through eMusic, and even, gasp, the occasional hard copy CD.  And I will continue to, in spite of continued effort to keep me from enjoying music the way I want.<br /><br />The visual art aspect will eventually disappear, sadly, but I will still keep listening.  Anyone that doubts the importance of visual art to a music release needs to go down to a local used record shop and play with Mick's zipper on the &lt;em>Sticky Fingers&lt;/em> album cover.  Or peel the &lt;em>Velvet Underground and Nico&lt;/em>'s banana.  Or even thumb over CD of Pet Shop Boys' &lt;em>Very&lt;/em>.<br /><br />You can't say that the delivery of a release is not a legitimate part to be reviewed.  If the best cheeseburger in the world was served to you wrapped in yesterday's coffee-ground covered newsprint, would you still eat it?

B00005QIPH|3.0|Don't get me wrong about the Strokes; I absolutely agree that they are much better than most pop bands today, but unfortunately they are major rip-offs of the Velvet Underground/ Lou Reed. There's a difference between being influence and being imitators. I have to say to surpass that factor it's a fairly descent album. It has a lot of catchy riffs and good tunes. Sorry Julian, but its time to find your own voice.
B000EHRVP6|3.0|I may be one of the few people who actually enjoyed Eli Roth's first film, Cabin Fever, despite the many inherent flaws to the story, direction and all-over-the-place feel. I never bought into the tagline for that film as once of the most horrific films this generation. I've been watching horror films for as long as I can remember and Cabin Fever doesn't even scratch the surface of what constitutes a great horror film. But it did show me that Eli Roth was serious about genre and acknowledges and honors his roots and influences.<br /><br />Hostel is Roth's sophomore effort, and just like Rob Zombie with his second film (The Devil's Rejects) he shows improvement as a filmmaker and continues to show that he respects the genre he's chosen to be in. Hostel is an exercise in hate, pain and nihilism. There really are no sympathetic characters in the film. Roth instead shows just how debased, cruel and inhumane people can be towards each other. Whether its through verbal, physical and intellectual means. I must point out that this film is not the torture-porn that alot of media-types call it. The gore and torture really doesn't start until fully halfway into the film. Everything before the second half begins can be summed us as soft-core porn. There's alot of nudity and sex in this first half and sets-up the three characters played by Jay Hernandez, Derek Richardson and Eythor Gudjonsson.<br /><br />These three college students are shown as boorish, misogynistic, insensitive louts who wish nothing more from their European vacation than sex, drugs, sex, drugs and more sex. It's this behavior that lures them to a town in Slovakia. An Eastern European, Soviet Bloc-era town where the women are stunning and horny to do whatever with foreign men. So, the trio takes off for this haven of horny, easy, beautiful women and the soft-core porn sequences continues once they arrive. But intermixed within these sequences are small bits and hints of dread and uneasiness. There's a certain sense of decay to the town and its inhabitants despite the normal scenery.<br /><br />The second half promptly begins once they arrive in town and check into the hsotel. The gore mentioned by most reviewers are pretty graphic for what was finally given an R-rating. For people like myself and other horror aficionados the gore in Hostel is something we haven't seen before. The gore and torture scenes are in-your-face and Roth owes alot of thanks to Takashi Miike's Audition in how the scenes are presented. Roth's style of directing Hostel really brings to mind Miike's cult favorite. Takashi Miike even makes a brief appearance in the film.<br /><br />One thing that I wanted Roth to do which he seemed to have pulled back from was going all-out in presenting Hostel as a horror exploitation film. This film tries to emulate the gory exploitation Italian and American films of the mid-70's to early 80's. Maybe the MPAA had forced Roth to trim certain scenes to get an R-rating. In certain scenes one could almost feel and sense that something was left out. Maybe the DVD release with an unrated, director's cut will shed some light to this. Roth's influences are plain to see, but he falls slightly short of reaching the lofty heights that Romero, Miike, Fulci, Craven (early), Hooper, Gordon and Argento established with their grand guignol works.<br /><br />Hostel is a very good second offering from Eli Roth who really seem to like the horror genre and is constantly trying to pay it homage. His direction is much better and gone are the campy, almost comedic sequences from Cabin Fever. The film does fail to convey anything original to the genre, but succeeds enough in honoring its bloody past. Roth went from a genre-hack to very promising horror auteur with Hostel. I am hoping his next project is less of an homage to horror's past and he actually adds to its future legacy. I'm happy to give this film a grade of 7/10.ain sense of decay to the town and its inhabitants despite the normal scenery. <br /> <br />The second half promptly begins once they arrive in town and check into the hsotel.

B00008QSA5|5.0|I think the real reason behind writing reviews like this lies in the hope that you will be able to convince some person(s) out there that something is missing form their life unless they get to hear this music. I don't think I can get any more eloquent on the brilliance of these musicians than any other reviewer here; the only words of praise in addition are for Harvey Brook's bass playing which is both beautiful, inventive and absolutely essential in tying together the Bloomfield and the Stills parts. It feels like they are somehow sailing along on the same river of bass, although they have very different  playing styles. (Must mention too Stills' wah-wah playing at the end of \\"Season of the witch\\", the most \\"lyrical\\" use of this effect I have heard to this day). <br />So as you may understand, I have always loved this record (although I must say it took some spinnings back in -68 for it to grow on me). Those who love it, will know, and for those who haven't heard it, let it grow on you too, and it could be one of those pieces of music that will follow you through the years, make your hard times easier to endure and the good times even more enjoyable.
B000002X2B|5.0|Wow! After listening to the entire cd I now know where Radiohead came from. Brilliant and as cutting edge as cutting edge can get. This is not the \\"Starship\\" of the eighties or early nineties but a very different style. Grace Slick's voice over the flawless guitar work and lyrics of Paul Kantner is just awesome. Go get this and just listen yourself.
0307276902|5.0|Ali Bruha- February 23, 2006 <br />A Million Little Pieces, James Frey, 0-307-27690-2 <br />An Emotionally Breath Taking and Heart Breaking Book <br /> \\"I want a drink. I want fifty drinks. I want a blow of a pipe full of the strongest rock. I want fifty blows of it. I want pills, acid, mushrooms, meth, PCP, glue. I want as much of it as I can get. I want it all.\\" -James Frey <br /> A Million Little Pieces is the exhilarating biography of 23-year-old James Frey. An alcoholic for ten years and a crack addict for three, he checked into a Residential Drug and Alcohol Treatment Facility in Minnesota. There, doctors told him that he could either stop using, or die. <br /> This book is definitely a tops on my list because it is a book that you just can't put down. It is an extremely descriptive and compelling book that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Out of all the biographies I have ever read, this is the best one yet. It is extremely inspiring, gripping, and moving. It is definitely a higher level reading book and children under the age of 13 should ask permission before reading it. Otherwise, I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading biographies or anyone who loves a good page-turner. Maybe even someone who is looking for a little bit of inspiration will find what they are looking for in this book. <br /> I have always enjoyed reading biographies and other stories based on true life events. So when my Grandma told me that I might enjoy reading this book, I gave it a try. Little did I know, that I would find myself feeling exactly what James felt while reading it. There were parts in the book where I felt that I was there, standing beside him, fighting my way to recovery. <br /> While I was reading this book, there were some parts where my mind wandered off. Not because it was hard for me to concentrate, but because I couldn't help but wonder what was going through his head when he did some of the things that he had done. He takes addiction to a wholenew level. <br />   <br />  <br /> <br /> <br />
B0001GL3K4|5.0|One of my all time top ten!  See it whenever you feel down.  It is funny and heartwarming and your worries will disappear. <br /> <br />Rent it first, if you don't believe me.  Then you'll want to come and buy it too! :-)
B000AU1NY2|3.0|I love coldplay. They are absolutely one of my favortie bands, but this import version of the album isn't all it is craked up to be. First of all, the hidden bonus track isn't \\"How You See The World\\", it's \\"Pour Me\\". Secondly, there are better versions of this album out there. For example the Dutch Limited Edition which has all of the B-Sides up to \\"Talk\\" (\\"Hardest Part\\" B-Sides are not on here) on a Bonus Disc. Over all I would not recommend this version of X&Y.

068987474X|1.0|Hmmm, do ALL men really react this way when they are not into someone? I read on a for men website that if I ask for a break, that means I really want to break up with him. Not true. I recently just asked for some time apart in my relationship. My reason? I just want to see how into me he really is, if my absense making his heart grow fonder and vice versa. If the feelings are still there, I definitly want to continue the relationship. Though some of the things may be signs, you can't base a failed relationship with it. Haven't you ever held back in some ways because you fear rejection and don't want to put yourself out there or look to needy? Maybe men are that way too. Read this book reviews from the men, almost 100% of them do not agree with the author.
B0007YMUZW|4.0|There are bits and pieces of everyone's reviews that I can agree with. First of all, Ryan does need an editor. I am not a detractor of Ryan's work. The music world is much better off with Ryan than without. Rock needs him and so does country. However, you do kind of wonder when he will put it all together, and come up with, dare I say, a concise album? Secondly, when an artist gets too grandiose and writes more songs than humanly possible, he is in danger of producing crap as well as the good stuff(maybe all the crap is for the sake of the good songs). And Ryan Adams is most definitely guilty of this. That being said, this is a very good double album which, when it hits the mark, hits it dead center. Songs like Magnolia Mountain, Easy Plateau, and Dance all Night are beautiful expressions. The influences are definitely there but they blend. That's when the magic happens with Ryan. At any rate, Ryan equals risk(in more ways than one), and he is well worth the misses for the hits.
B00005JNQA|2.0|Despite a terrific performance by Sean Penn, and a decent one from Nicole Kidman, this movie didn't move me.  It manages to be both dull and improbable.  There's a lot of Screenwriting 101 in it, stakes raised in a way that, unfortunately, feels very artificial.  It also seems quaintly nostalgiac in its depiction of the UN. The founders of the UN might have fantasized it would work like this in 2005, but it doesn't.<br /><br />It's diverting enough if you've seen everything else, or if you are a fan of the stars.  But keep your expectations low.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Great variety of tempos and beats.  Fabulous music and singing. I would rate this in my top 10 favorites ever.
B000E97X66|5.0|This is a fantastic example of a great Artist and a great band in the prime of their careers. The power and the fury of this concert is amazing to watch on DVD (included with the Born to Run boxset) and listen to on CD.
B00005M91K|5.0|I first saw Baraka because the DVD was included as a promotion with my parents' DVD player. I had never heard of the movie before that. The first time I watched it, I was transfixed. Now I watch the movie every couple months or so. It trully is an experience, and I find that the lack of narrative (and narration) actually adds to the movie's re-watchability, because you don't feel like you're treading over information or story that you're already so familiar with. I just received my copy of the special edition anamorphic version, and what I've seen of it on my high-def TV is just astounding. <br /> <br />It seems the most common complaint is that there is no context provided to the scenes. Initially I did try to think about where the various scenes were and what was going on. However, I've found that if you stop trying to think about the intellectual details of the scenes, only then do you begin to truly *experience* them. <br /> <br />Granted, this movie is not for everyone, but I suggest that everyone see it at least once.
0920236162|5.0|I often give this book as a gift to girls in the 3-6 age range.  It is a great story that can be read in a light-hearted way, yet packs a very important message of personal strength and independence that every little girl should hear.  My almost 4 yr. old daughter loves this story.  (My son 5 yr old son does, too.)  They often act it out with puppets and my daughter often refers to her Prince Charming doll as Prince Ronald.  This book will remain on my daughters shelves through the dating years, and perhaps longer if she chooses.

B0000024YL|5.0|More than once I have panned re-issues of albums on CD that added nothing to the original.  My usual reason is that a CD can hold 80 minutes of music and a vinyl album typically had 38 to 48 minutes of music.  My criticism increases with a \\"greatest\\" or \\"best of\\" collection because there are almost always more songs that could or should have been added.  My criticism of content should extend to this album as well, but this album embodies Simon and Garfunkel's peak popularity and its value is as much historical and contextual as commercial.  Yes, I purchased this album in spite of the numerous collections of varying sizes, including a comprehensive collection of all of Simon and Garfunkel's works.  I am unable to explain why this album works for me, but I suspect it is because I grew up in the 60s and 70s.<br /><br />This collection is just a bit too brief, but what magnificent songs.<br /><br />\\"Mrs. Robinson,\\" \\"The Sound of Silence\\" and \\"Scarborough Fair/Canticle\\" are musical poetry.  All three songs are part of the soundtrack to the 1967 movie \\"The Graduate.\\"  \\"The Sound of Silence\\" in particularly is one of the greatest songs of the rock era.  The latter two songs are great melancholy songs for a rainy day.<br /><br />There are also live songs on this album.  The gorgeous song \\"For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her\\" is one of those songs.  Though the clapping at the end is a bit loud, the song itself is one of the best versions available.  Art Garfunkel shows in this song why his pairing with Paul Simon was so incredible.  Another live song is \\"The 59th Street Bridge Song,\\" which most know as \\"Feelin' Groovy.\\"  This song is a marvelous little ditty that shows the playful side of the duo.  The clapping fits better here and lets you imagine the duo playing on a New York City street in the springtime.<br /><br />\\"The Boxer\\" is a story song that is one of the best story songs of any era.  Part folk, part rock, and all art, this song combines catchy and dramatic music with catchy lyrics and a poignant story that is simultaneously haunting and enjoyable.  Another poignant song that fits well with \\"The Boxer\\" is \\"I Am a Rock.\\"  Both songs seem to offer introspective views of life and remind us all that we are responsible for ourselves.<br /><br />\\"Homeward Bound\\" is a live song.  This harmonious folk song is a wonderful addition to this CD.  This song would be perfect for a movie soundtrack.  This song rolls into another live song, the phenomenal \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\\" where Art Garfunkel gets to show his vocal range.  I do not know where this song was recorded, but the acoustics of the song itself are wonderful and highlight the power of the song and contrast between the soft opening and powerful ending.<br /><br />\\"America\\" is another song that makes effective use of powerful vocals and music.  This song is a celebration of country and seeking oneself as well as seeking who we are as a nation.  The story in the song is deeper than the words suggest.  This song is one of Simon and Garfunkel's greats.<br /><br />\\"Kathy's Song\\" is a friendly little live song.  This song is pretty, but is less dramatic and artistic than many of the other songs on this CD.  This song contained elements that foreshadowed the future of Paul Simon's music.<br /><br />The following song is yet another incredible song.  \\"El Condor Pasa (If I Could)\\" contains incredible music and vocals and is yet another of Simon and Garfunkel's greatest songs.  The haunting panpipe used in this song makes it one of the most memorable songs in the duo's portfolio.<br /><br />\\"Bookends\\" is a lovely little song that provides a significant contrast with the percussion driven ending of this CD, \\"Cecilia.\\"  \\"Cecilia\\" is the most enthusiastic song on this CD.  The close out of this album, from \\"El Condor Pasa\\" to \\"Bookends\\" and ending with \\"Cecilia\\" was a brilliant way to close out the album.  Rather than feeling melancholy, as the previous songs would have done, you leavefeeling good and wanting to do it all over again.<br /><br />There are many other collections of the works of Simon and Garfunkel, which often includes some of their solo works.  However, at the time this album was released, this collection was the collection to have.  I still listen to this collection a lot, even with everything else that is available.  I suspect I always will.  Enjoy!e done, you leave feeling good and wanting to do it all over again. <br /> <br />There are many other collections of the works of Simon and Garfunkel, which often includes some of their solo works.

0553801503|3.0|I bought all of the books in the series at once.  It took me several months, but I finally finished reading them.  I've already commented about how these books change your mood.  They are dark, and at times, hard to follow.  But, having invested hours upon hours reading the thousands of pages, I was determined to finish. <br /> <br />My first thought when I picked up A Feast for Crows was, \\"Well, at last this series will end.\\"  My second thought when I saw that this was only a cropped together edition with more to follow was, \\"Will this series ever end?\\" <br /> <br />This book appears to be a cropped together edition to meet a publishing deadline.  It doesn't have the rich cast of characters that the earlier books in the series portray.  My feelings were that he took a few characters, filled up 600+ pages, and submitted it for publication to buy some time.   <br /> <br />I was so frustrated that this series didn't end with this book that I went to his web page to see when the next book would come out, and whether it would be the last book in this interminable story.  All I found were promises that the next book would be in the 1200 to 1300 range. <br /> <br />My second feeling after finishing this book was relief.  At last I had a break from the intense darkness of the books.  I could pick up the other books that I had set aside and enjoy some lighter, more relaxing reading.   <br /> <br />I wonder if the word Brienne shouted was, \\"ENOUGH\\". <br /> <br />
B00005JO9J|5.0|Grey's Anatomy is the most amazing show i've ever seen. it makes me laugh and cry and get way too excited. the first season is excellent. i highly recommend this show for anyone and everyone.
B000B19BCG|5.0|I've read several press reviews of Road To Rouen and they often mention that this CD has been less well-received than past issues, with poorer sales.  If that's true, it's a pity, because this CD is gorgeous, beautiful, and still rocks. <br /> <br />If you are looking for songs similar to previous Supergrass CDs, particularly \\"In It For the Money\\" or \\"Life On Other Planets\\", you may be disappointed.  But Gaz and the boys have smartly decided not to simply re-hash past glories, or worse, continue to write about topics important to them back in their teens and early 20's. <br /> <br />Road To Rouen is the soundtrack of a band aging and maturing, both lyrically and musically.  Some of the songs are somewhat subdued and somber, particularly \\"Tales of Endurance...\\" and \\"St Petersburg\\", but they are sonically adventurous and still \\"hummable\\", quickly working themselves into your brain.  \\"Roxy\\" and \\"Kick in the Teeth\\" also stand out.  The title track is pretty much the only tune that doesn't really grab, at least to me. <br /> <br />I saw the band live just a few days ago in Seattle, and they did a brilliant job putting these songs on live, not to mention other great songs from their back catalog.  As noted by previous reviewers on this site, it's criminal that a band of this intelligence and excellence is not promoted more effectively here in the states.  Fortunately, at least, there are still enough die-hard fans around to fill a club show, and better yet, we get them all to ourselves! <br /> <br />This CD is a must-have for any serious Supergrass fan, even those who prefer their earlier stuff.
B000BKVQTS|4.0|I am just 20 minutes into it so far but anything that resembles Sleepy Hollow as much as this has to be good.
B000BGH22W|1.0|I was sorely disappointed in this soundtrack.  I was looking forward to hearing John Williams once again as I sat down to watch the movie.  I was looking forward to the musical journey that Williams always takes you on. His music brings deep impact and brings a \\"magic touch\\" with it.  This soundtrack was a dud; I was not moved in any way.  I just sat there and thought to myself, \\"Is this it?\\".  I really hope they bring John Williams back for the next Harry Potter movie.
0375815260|5.0|Yes, I have seen both versions of the movie, but after hearing that the most recent production was much like the book, I had to read and compare for myself.  I bought Charlie and the Chocolate Factory as a birthday gift for myself and I am so glad that I did.  Once again I was whirled away to the wacky world of Willy Wonka with Charlie and Grandpa Joe, but this time I could create the illustrations in my head.  And though I know the story well, there were a few surprises, such as the square caramels that look round, which made me smile.  Overall, it's a very worth-while read, if only to taste the snozzberries one more time.
B000000YNZ|5.0|Five Stars are not enough: this CD is worthy of SIX Stars!! When uber-bassist Scottie La Faro was killed in a car accident, it took a devastated Bill Evans a full year to both recover and to acclimate to his new bassist Chuck Israels to the point of being ready to record. Israels brought to the trio another dimension of jazz bass wizardry using 'commentary' on Evans' work, instead of the previous 'conversations' between Bill's piano and La Faro's mighty bass. Produced by the great Orrin \\"OKeep\\" Keepnews, this CD is essential Bill Evans and one of the greatest jazz ballad performances-ever.  Along with the legendary recording, \\"Sunday At The Village Vanguard\\" (with La Faro), this recording finally slammed the door on all assertions that Bill Evans was a better sideman than a leader.<br /><br />As ballads should be, these tunes are generally taken at a slow pace but never maudlin. They are in fact very beautiful and spectacular, as Bill shows a different side to what are mostly very familiar ballads loved by jazzmen. Evans usually states the theme at a slow pace and accelerates into a faster pace after one pass, springing off of Israels' bedrock phrases.<br /><br />The Piece D' Resistance, the modish \\"Re: Person I Knew\\" (an oblique reference to Keepnews) is a shot across the bow of 1960's pianism with Evans reeling off mighty, wondrous statements that are breathtaking, crystal clear, and with a relaxed intensity. Israels' first recorded bass solo with the trio is both deeply emotional and technically adept showing he is a worthy successor to La Faro. \\"Very Early\\" is a fabulous convoluted jazz waltz that shows off another view of Bill's compositional and soloing skills. Israels' bass commentary and his solo are a joy to hear. Tadd Dameron's super ballad \\"If You Could See Me Now\\" is pure block-chorded beauty (especially on 'the bridge'), as is \\"Polka Dots and Moonbeams\\", both shifting gears after one pass through with wondrous, dazzling single-noted lines that never stray from lyricism. \\"I Fall in Love Too Easily\\", \\"Stairways To The Stars\\" (note the fabulous Paul Motian brushwork and Evans' blazing coda), and \\"It Might As Well Be Spring\\" are total lyrical examples of what a jazz trio should be, with all members contributing SIMULTANEOUSLY and INVENTIVELY to the flow of the music from theme to solo to recapitulation.  Paul Motian does some mighty, but subtle drumming throughout providing excellent support within the trio framework. An Essential Jazz Recording. My HIGHEST Recommendation!  Five LYRICAL Stars!!<br /><br />(Note: Bill Evans had a crucial choice to make: whether to play classical piano or jazz piano. We are so lucky that he chose jazz, probably to the detriment of his health, and brought alot of his classical techniques along for the ride. It was never on better display than on this CD.)ay from lyricism. \\"I Fall in Love Too Easily\\", \\"Stairways To The Stars\\" (note the fabulous Paul Motian brushwork and Evans' blazing coda), and \\"It Might As Well Be Spring\\" are total lyrical examples of what a jazz trio should be, with all members contributing SIMULTANEOUSLY and INVENTIVELY to the flow of the music from theme to solo to recapitulation.

B00005K3NR|5.0|With its dark humor and its disturbing imagery, CARRIE has to be one of the best horror films ever made (and at least in the top 50 films ever made). Sissy Spacek (in her first Oscar nominated role) plays Carrie White, a tormented and abused teen who wants nothing more than to have a few friends. One day, while showering in gym class, she has her first period. She has no idea what is going on (her mother, who I'll get to in a minute, never tells her anything about puberty, believing everything about it is either a sin or unimportant) so she freaks out. Her classmates don't help things either, by giving her a lot of grief, until her sympathetic gym teacher comes in and breaks up the ruckus. Carrie then gets sent home by the principal, who is intent on calling her Cassie, who doesn't know that things there aren't any better (and are probably worse). Once home her mother (Piper Laurie, also nominated for an Oscar for this film) starts preaching to her and then throws her into the cupboard under the stars. Yet, that's only the beginning, and I'm not about to sit here and type up the entire screenplay for you. So, you're just gonna have to rent it or buy it (rent first, because this movie isn't for everyone). I have but one grievance for the film itself (and the novel, actually): Why does Carrie end up in Hell? She was a good person, and simply snapped and took revenge on her class (harshly, VERY harshly) and that destroyed her immortal soul! I think that Carrie should not have been killed off right away, and ABSOLUTELY should have been given another chance to redeem herself and repent what she did. She wasn't by any means a bad person, she was driven to do what she did. But all in all, this film is excellent and is one of my favorites. <br /> <br />p.s.- I have seen NETWORK (excellent film), but I still think that Sissy Spacek should have gotten the Best Actress award over Faye Dunaway (who also was excellent in her role, but I think that Sissy Spacek was superior in her acting than her.). <br />But, that's just my opinion. What's yours?
B000BT97AO|5.0|This movie is just wierd and just plain fun to watch.  The creator had so many unique ideas and such a wild imagination, and all of this is brought to the screen for you to enjoy.  This film reminded me of Wizard of Oz and Alice in Wonderland, but it is still original enough to hold it's own.  The movie is pleasing to watch, as the visuals are astouding.  Anyway, I think you'll enjoy it if you like fantasy movies.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|If you don't know already, Hypnotize is not a raw, all-out assault on the ears like some of their earlier stuff is.  In Mezmerize, Daron took a greater role in the singing, and that continues into this album.  I prefer Serj's voice, but I think that Daron's compliments it well.  <br /> <br />If you like cool little bits of flair in your music, this CD is for you.  I love all the eastern influence in the guitar solos that are scattered throughout this album!  Here's what I think of the individual songs: <br /> <br />1. Attack - 7.5/10. Fast, intense.  Has its moments, but something just doesn't quite work for me in this one.  <br /> <br />2. Dreaming - 7.5/10.  Musically complex lines sung on top of each other, then they join up.  Cool bridge, but the chorus-to-verse transition is anticlimactic.   <br /> <br />3.  Kill Rock n Roll - 8/10. Good music and harmonization, but terrible lyrics.  If you want to make nonsense lyrics, that's fine, but do it right, like track #9.   <br /> <br />4.  Hypnotize - 9/10.  Easy to like.  Is well-written and makes sense.  Cool dynamics and percussion changes.  So starts the meat and potatoes of the CD.  <br /> <br />5.  Stealing Society - 10/10.  Great buildup and harmonies.  It really screams \\"tension\\" <br /> <br />6.  Tentative - 10/10.  Awesome. The non-melodic verses set up the solid chorus so well.  Also, the bridge/guitar part is sweet! \\"Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall?\\" <br /> <br />7.  U-Fig - 9.5/10.  Cool verses.  I don't really like the \\"eatemeatemeatem\\" part, but you can hear the hear the chaos in Serj's voice when he screams things like \\"Come join the cause!\\"  I also like the quiet little guitar part in this one. <br /> <br />8.  Holy Mountains - 10/10.  Quiet, haunting.  I love the vocal effects on this one, then Serj explodes on the chorus!  I want to go to a SOAD concert so bad, and this song is one of the reasons.  I'm sure it would be nuts! <br /> <br />9.  Vicinity of Obscenity - 10/10.  Craziest song on the CD.  Lyrics make no sense to me, and it's not even very musical or melodic.  I don't even know why I like this song, but it's just so crazy I love it!  It's like a siren blaring in your ear.   <br /> <br />10.  She's Like Heroin - 6.5/10.  The album takes a turn south.  Really weak lyrics, Daron sounds sickly, and the rhythm isn't cohesive.  Seems like the target audience for this song is a fifth grade kid who doesn't want his parents to find the parental advisory CD in his dresser drawer. <br /> <br />11.  Lonely Day - 8/10.  With better lyrics I'd give it a 10.  I don't care that it's grammatically incorrect, but they use weak lines just so they can rhyme with the previous weak lines.  Really cool bridge and guitar work though. <br /> <br />12.  Soldier Side - 10/10.  Great and fitting ending.  Such a good sense of feeling in the music, and dramatic lyrics to close out the album/double album in appropriate fashion.  <br /> <br />***All in all, I hope they step up the lyrics a bit next time, but this was a great album!  I hope SOAD don't relinquish too much musical control to Rick Rubin/Columbia/The Man because I need them to keep coming out with great albums so I have music to listen to!
B00005K9LK|5.0|This is by far one of the best Judas Priest albums ever made. By this time Priest made 8 albums all of them are essential. Judas Priest will keep this up until the release of Turbo (but I dont see why people don't like that one. Anyway, every song on this album is excellent! From the moment that you hear The Hellon (which is the best opening track) every song will draw you in. This is a metal classic. But don't neglect the others. British Steel, Stained Class, Hell Bent For Leather, Defenders of the Faith, and Painkiller aren't the only good Priest albums. If you're going to get one Priest cd, you might as well try them all. They're all amazing. Don't forget to get Point of Entry, Sin After Sin, Sad Wings of Destiny, Turbo and Ram it Down. They're just as good, if not better.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Ok, I was not a Green Day fan until my cousin told me about this album. I didn't dislike them, I just didn't really know them very well. I wasn't really into the \\"punk\\" scene, and I assumed that this band would sound whiney or screamy and what not. But I gave it a chance (really, how can you not \\"give it a chance\\" when the only thing played on the radio when the album came out was \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\", seriously I have given it the nickname 'the most played song in the history of radio broadcasting, still an incredible song, but I'll get to that later). Man, was I happy that I had somewhat of an open mind. I heard some of the main tracks like \\"American Idiot\\", and of course, \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\". I wasn't planning on buying the album, but once I heard \\"Holiday\\", I was sold. I listened to every song and before I knew it, I was hooked. I couldn't believe how good this band was!! So after this album, I bought an album of a collection of their previous songs before \\"American Idiot\\", and I loved them too. I can now say that Green Day is my favorite band. Since someone did it before I will give a song by song breakdown too, because I want to. <br /> <br />American Idiot-3.5 stars- good catchy fast paced song, but not the album's best. <br /> <br />Jesus Of Suburbia-4 stars- really long song, but has the power to keep you listening. <br /> <br />Holiday-(ridiculous)- I would love to rate this song, but am unable to because of the fact that it's the most unbelievable song ever. Seriously, I would have bought this album for this one song. By far my favorite on the album, and my favorite Green Day song overall. <br /> <br />Boulevard Of Broken Dreams-5 stars- Awesome song. Yes, it got alot of radio airplay, but it deserved it. Just because it was hammered into our heads via radio is not an excuse to dislike it. Second best on the album. <br /> <br />Are We The Waiting-4 stars- Good candlelight vigil song. Short, but good. <br /> <br />St. Jimmy-3.5 stars- I'vebeen told that this is the most \\"punk\\" song on the album, so if you want that, this song is it. Fast sort of like American Idiot. <br /> <br />Give Me Novacaine-4 stars- Good song to hum along to. Easy going, that's how I describe it. <br /> <br />She's A Rebel-3 stars- Could be longer. Still good however. <br /> <br />Extraordinary Girl-3.5 stars- Good tune. Just adds to the overall sound of the album nicely. <br /> <br />Letterbomb-4.5 stars- One of the hidden jewels on the cd. Really good song. 4th favorite on the album.  <br /> <br />Wake Me Up When September Ends-5 stars- Like Boulevard Of Broken Dreams, it got alot of airplay (and still does, of course), but it is a beautiful sounding song and my 3rd favorite. <br /> <br />Homecoming-4 stars- Another long ballad like \\"Jesus Of Suburbia\\". If you liked that one, you will also appriciate this one.  <br /> <br />Whatsername-4 stars- Ah a good song indeed. Another one of those hidden gems. Listen to track 13 and you'll be pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br />That wraps up my review. An amazing album, enough said. And if you don't have it yet, get your butt out and get it!! You won't be dissapointed.
B000008LH5|5.0|\\" Alvin Lee & Ten Years After were an amazing studio band but on stage, in front of a packed house, is where these guys tore the roof off !! This disc will prove that. 11 tracks of live brilliance ! For you TYA fans, no \\"Hobbit\\" here due to time limitations. That was the Ric Lee drum solo that went on & on & on......Anyway, This thing is up there right next to Alvin Lee's Woodstock appearance 4 years earlier. It opens with two of my favorite TYA songs, \\"One of these Days\\" & \\"You Give Me Loving\\". Then we get \\"Good Morning Little Schoolgirl\\" which leads us into some sweet, sweet blues stuff. The 15 minute plus \\"I Can't Keep From Crying Sometimes\\" is worth the price of admission alone. Finally, \\"I'm Going Home\\" & \\"Choo Choo Mama\\" wraps up the cd with some seriously straight up Rock N Roll!! Originally released in 1973, I saw this tour @ Madison Square Garden in NYC. ZZ Top opened for them, pre Tres Hombres, and they came out for THREE encores!! It was the only time in my life I've actually seen the tiers buckling up and down like a wave in the Garden. It was a major blowout and these guys were incredible !! This cd brings that night right back to me. Over 70 minutes of Chick Churchill on keyboards, Leo Lyons on Bass, Ric Lee on drums & Alvin Lee. If you like rock n roll, do yourself a favor and throw this in your shopping cart right now. You'll be overjoyed that you did.
068987474X|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! Such good advice and full of humor to boot. I highly recommend this book for every woman!
0805047905|4.0|This is a really simple book with large pictures.  It's great for one of the first books that you read to your baby.  Even a young baby would like looking at the colorful pictures.  Recommended!
B000BKJ78K|4.0|If you havn't already noticed alot of the movies being released on to video these days are comming out with two versions:one with the special features and one without. This is just simple one of those movies. other examples of this are batman begins and War of the worlds(check for yourself). Its a new marcheting scheme that allows fans to purchase the special features along with the trilogy, aswell it also allows people to buy the trilogy with out having to spend extra money on bonus features. Alot people are complaining about this but then agian a few years ago alot of people were complaining about how every dvd was labeled special edition. These days it seems they are starting to release normal and special edition DVDs. Long story short if you already have the trilogy with the bonus disc, this is useless except for a nice facy box(lol). If you dont own either and you dont want to spend an extra 10 bucks on a behind the scenes DVD youd probably want this.
B00004U28G|4.0|You have to love this movie. I really liked all of the comedy with all of the starts like Sammy Davis Jr., Dean Martin, Roger Moore, Terry Bradshaw, Dom Deluise, and Farrah Facwett.  Also, all of the crazy scenes with Jackie Chan.  Good G rated film for the family!!!
0307276902|4.0|I read this book when it first got its attention for being one of Oprah's Book Club picks. I work at a bookstore, and so quite intrigued by the sheer number of people that came and requested the book, I decided to read it myself and see what all the fuss was about. It took a little while to get used to his style of writing, but once I started reading, I couldn't put it down. I have never read a book so intense before and was very happy that I read it.  <br />Some parts of the book though, are a little hard to believe, but despite the controversy surrounding the book I still recommend it. Whether one wants to read it as a fiction or a nonfiction book, it is quite good and a definite page turner.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Based very closely on Michael Shaara's book the Killer Angels, this is a fabulously recreated film with little compromise to Holywood nonsense.  4 hours of powerful and well constructed cinematography that simply flew by (albeit in 2 sittings).  It had this Brit totally immersed in the tragedy of brother fighting against brother in the American civil war.  If it is not compulsory viewing for American kids in school, it should be!  Lest we forget.
B0002OOUP0|5.0|If you are looking for a good wide spread collection of the best of the stones this is not you best buy. I personally made the mistake of buying this thinking it had little more than it actually did. Dont allow the \\"best of\\" title to throw you off. This collection doesn't even include any of their hits from the 60s(the title could have tould you that). Surprisingly, however, it does include some of their stuff from the early 90s which was probably the worst period in their career. This being said, Its still what I would consider a good compilation of The Stone's music.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I do believe that watching the Firefly series first will help but you don't have to.  By way of testimonial though I actually watched Serenity first and liked it enough that I then watched the whole Firefly series so that should be an indication of how good it is I hope.<br /><br />Firefly was an amazing series that wove, cool concepts, giant glactic govenment, rebles, smugglers, awesome characters, interesting mysteries, violence and peace all together to come up with probably one of the most original sci-fi concepts around.  Its cancelation was a kick in the sack to its fans and kind of makes us late takers cry on the inside.<br /><br />The movie gave us the crew of Serenity again with a slightly bigger budget, cool story, and was a way for Joss to tie up some of the loose ends in the series.  Although they would have been so much more if he could of done it over the course of, oh say, Season 2! Oh well.<br /><br />The movie itself ties up one of the main mysteries of the series, that of, \\"What's up with River?\\"  It leaves other open though, such as what the Sheppard's real back ground is.  Maybe well find out one day.  Cross your fingers.<br /><br />While the movie itself and the final outcome may not have been the most original, its still wrapped around an excellent cast and concept that, if you've seen the series, you care about.  If you haven't seen the series it may peak you interest enough that you'll want to as in my case.  We're also treated to some new characters, one really cool, the other, not so much.<br /><br />We got you're space fights, fist fights, gun fights and sword fights with a little martial arts too so no lacking of action.  Give it a try and if you have not seen Firefly then you just may want to.
B000A32KJQ|2.0|while i'm not that familiar with a lot of katche's work, when i saw the personnel on this disc i happily plunked down my money. stanko and 2 of his young trio and jan garbarek? how could i go wrong? <br /> <br />obviously, quite wrong. this may be the best smooth jazz album ever made. however, if you don't like smooth jazz, that isn't saying much. <br /> <br />it's katche, really, that ruins this album. a previous reviewer referred to this music as \\"light.\\" very true. but it's also harmonically and rhythmically simplistic, giving no challenges to the improvisers whatsoever. it's handcuffing, relegating a great young bassist's baselines to ostinato \\"grooves\\" that go nowhere.  <br /> <br />stanko tries to break out a bit, playing a few of his trademark \\"whisper to a scream\\" lines, but they don't fit in this unimaginative, \\"smooth\\" music. wasieleski's usual brilliant uses of free rhythm are locked into adult contemporary grooves.  <br /> <br />at times, katche hangs back and lets the rest of the group shine a bit, which keeps this from being a 1 star album. but basically, it's easy listening, something you can put on when your friends who think dave sanborn is jazz come over for dinner.  <br /> <br />this comes a such a dissapointment because of the quality of the players, and i sincerely hope no one who buys this record is hearing stanko and his young cohorts for the first time, as it shows none of their true talents and personality. do yourself a favor and check out \\"suspended night\\" or \\"soul of things.\\"  <br /> <br />i know garbarek (whose vast output is all over the map, sometimes great) has recorded with katche quite a bit in recent years, and his \\"in praise of dreams,\\" (which i admittedly haven't heard)was similarly panned as being overly \\"smooth\\" by many. this is a shame, as he is a great artist who should be recognized for his achievements, not this misstep. <br /> <br />stanko fans beware.
0345440900|4.0|Okay so I'm writing this before my baby actually arrives (still 7 weeks out).  I found the book easy to read for the most part.  All the \\"English\\" nicknames for the reader (Ducky etc) got annoying but other than that I enjoyed the book.  Like all baby books I think you need to decide what is good for you and your family but I appreciated her take on things.  I definitely plan to use her suggestions.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|What more can we say about Fox network execs and their stupidity? I have a theory that sometimes it is best for a show to burn out bright before it gets stale, as with Futurama, but Firefly was never even given the chance to hit its maximum illumination.  Running the second episode first instead of the awesome 2 hour premier?  Stupid.  Dropping the viewers right into the middle of the world without even knowing the characters?  STUPID!<br /><br />Recomendation:  Buy the set and watch all 14 excellent epidodes in the order intended.  This show takes Star Trek tech, smashed it with the used look of Star Wars (Original Trilogy) and throws in the wild west for good measure.  In the middle of all this we meet a band of charming and intricate characters that Joss was able to have us care about in the very first episode on the DVD.  The cast is 100% excellent all the way around.<br /><br />The wild west theme seems strange at first but grows on you very quickly.  It kind of makes sense too.  Sure we have space faring tech but we just terra-formed this planet to colonize and dumped people on it so yeah they live in shacks and ride horses and use what's available.  Sure it might be a desert, its probably hard to terra-form a dead planet to green Earth specs.  It would take time for a planet to be changed in that way.<br /><br />Technological aspects aside the show is just awesome.  The characters and dialog shine and you just end up loving them.  By the third epidose you're laughing along with their in-jokes and care about their lives.  Not many a show can pull this off.  Serenity has the best captain around.  You might say he's a bad/nice guy like others try to be in other shows but never have I seen it pulled off so well.  You just know that Malcom Reynolds will try everything he can for a peaceful resolution but if he has to kill you he won't mind.<br /><br />The concept of America and China forming the basis of the planetary Alliance is also original.  Its cool that when the characters get upset or curse the lapse into Chinese.  Think of the Alliance as the Federation from Star Trek and the browncoats or border planets as rebels who hate those tight pants bureaucrates meddling and you get the idea.<br /><br />I could go on forever and it seems just amazing that all this was presented in only 14 episodes.  Just watch them.  Then curse Fox in Chinese.hat when the characters get upset or curse the lapse into Chinese.

B000E97Y6K|4.0|It is WAY too long.  I can appreciate that Jackson, along with the spectacular LOTR's tilogy, is a wonderful visionary & knows how to do action to rival Cameron & Speilberg.  HOWEVER, Jackson just tries WAY too hard here.  I loved the atmosphere of when they got to Skull Island in the fog.  Kinda creepy.  But how long did that scene last, 10 minutes?  Just get off the d*** boat already.  They needed maybe 2-3 minutes of mood & then get off the boat.  This isn't Titanic.  Then comes the dinasour stampede which was so obviously fake looking.  Could have saved about 10 minutes  Later we have a bug attack that was a complete waste of film.  Another 5-10 minutes or so cut.  Oh & about the dinasour attacking Ann & King in the vines...a few snaps were cool.  After about 10 I was like, \\"ok, this is getting tedious.  Move on.\\"  There's about 2-3 minutes nixed.  Developing a romance before Ann is captured would also have been nice.  One minute Ann & the screenwriter ar ebickering, th enext minute they're kissing.  If you were gonna need more time make it on a this & not on effects.  The great thing sbaout LOTR's is that it developed the chracters enough so yo cared what happened to them.  Now, I know, peopel will say, \\"oh but LOTR's was 3 movies.\\"  Yes, taht's true, but you can still develop your characters more in a 2-3 hour movie enough to care about them.  It's bad when your lead actress has more chemistry with a CGI gorilla than Adrian Brody.  \\"I wrote a play for you.\\"  WOW, he must love her because of that.  Jack Black is also NOT a serious actor.  He is & will always be a COMIC actor.  Ok, I know Robin Williams does both well, but if Black was gonna be realistic as a serious actor, nix the raised eyebrow thing.  Plus his famous line at the end was said so matter of factly it was like he was reading the line from the script.  I cringed.  I don't fault Jackson, as I said he is one amazing visionary.  I blame the editor for it.  Plus Andy Serkis, well apologes to the actual actor, does another terriffic job as a CGI character.  This Kong spend a lot more time developing the \\"relationship\\" with Ann & Kong & it did it rather successfully IMO.  Nix the dead pan Jack Black line & I really felt for Kong.  I credit Serkis' facial expressions for that.  But, I cant forget Watts, either.  What was with teh jailer & the criminal, too.  At least in The Green Mile the friendship, or whatever you call it, they had was credible.  I didn't really believe this one for a second.  Again, too much time spent on effects not enough on character development.  Quite entertaining, but overly long.
6305736650|5.0|This is my ALL TIME favorite movie. I have the dialoge down to every word.  This movie really should be rated 10 stars!
B000000OAL|5.0|The album ebbs and flows with creativity. It is almost bipolar in its delivery which makes it a gem. I remember them playing this live in Chicago. Ah!
B000ASATWQ|4.0|This is for every Marley fan.  He puts together another great album.  If you are a fan of Bob this is a must for you.  If you kind of like Marley but more of a hip hop head than this is also for you.  He mixes old style of reggae with more updated beats.  Not every song is like the single Jam Rock.  There are some slow jams.  I also saw him in concert.  He sounds the same as on the CD.  Great show.  I would see he whenever he comes remotely close to where I live.  Great CD recommend it to anyone.
B00005ATQF|4.0|Though the film is gripping it could have been better. The first half, which is about training, is not as intense as it should be. It sounds more like a comedy film. The next half of the next half is interesting. Surely not a 5 star film. I would barely watch it again.
B000002UUX|5.0|I just have to say that Holy Wars is the BEST Music Ever
B000AMJDHY|4.0|Okay, I havent actually got the album for this of my own, but I listen to my friends a lot. I think the msuic is so catchy, and i really like how they blend differnt types of music in (esp on the 'Im a diva' line from 'Theres a reason etc')The main reason I'm writing this review is to ask all the people that say the singer of patd sounds JUST LIKE the lead of fob, why that matters? Poeple have similar voices sometimes. Unless patd were actually having fobs singer when recording, I dont see what the problem is. This is a great band, and dont be put off by their comparisons to fob. their lyrics anmd sounds are fairly differnt, and the similarity of voices dont matter at all. Realy.
B0007M22TI|1.0|I saw this show on PBS and was totally blown away by the purity of the ladies voices.  Loved the selection of songs chosen for them to sing.  If you like a wide range of music you will certainly like this CD.  My personal favorite was You Raise Me Up.
B0002IU988|4.0|This band takes the best of what was Creed, the music and melodies, and adds an amazing vocalist in Myles Kennedy.  The CD is strong from beginning to end with good mix of powerful head-bangers (Metalingus, Watch Your Words, Find The Real), several big ballads (Broken Wings, In Loving Memory), and plenty of straight-up rock (One Day Remains, Down to My Last, and of course Open Your Eyes, the first single).  The guitar solo is also making a comeback in this cd with Mr. Tremonti shredding on FTR, OYE, Burn It Down, and Down To My Last.  There is still room for improvement in the song writing since a lot a the songs start sounding the same. However, I recommend this cd to anyone who likes loud guitars, soaring vocals, and lovely melodies.
B0000DJZB9|4.0|only 2 videos that are missing and that should have been on this is \\"You Could Be Mine\\" & \\"Knockin on heaven's Door\\"  and they could have put some interviews on it, and maybe the feud between AXL and Vince Neil from the 89 mtv vma's
0399226907|5.0|This book is a great book. I am in 1st grade and know this book is about a caterpillar that eats a lot of food. I would recommend this book to children of all ages. My other family members also like to read this book because it tells about him eating till he makes a coccon and becomes a beautiful butterfly.
B000C65Z1G|2.0|I wanted to like this film.  I even chose to \\"sleep on it\\" before offering up my opinion.  I just woke up hating it more. <br /> <br />Overall, this film is just an incredibly poor example of filmmaking.  For starters, the director's vision was foggy, at best.  I'm not sure what kind of film he hoped to make.  Spy thriller?  Romance?  Political intrigue?  Human interest?  Pseudo-ficto big Pharma expose'?  Regardless, the cinematography was poorly executed and totally inappropriate for the material.  The jerky, grainy camera work was distracting, dated and tiresome. <br /> <br />I also found the film to be totally implausible on many levels.  If this is an accurate portrayal of Le Carre's novel, he should stick to writing about British spies in Europe.  I question whether he even bothered to research the elaborate hoops a pharmaceutical company has to jump through before a drug ever even reaches First-in-Human trials.  He also apparently has no concept of the vast number of local and international watchdog organizations in existence solely devoted to medical and human rights issues in Africa. (MANY, on both counts.)  Where were the watchdog organizations?  One woman and one doctor are going to take on this company and the British foreign ministers alone?  I think not. <br /> <br />Another plausibility problem for me was believing that Justin (Fiennes) and Tessa (Weisz) could possibly fall in love in the first place, given their vastly different approaches to life.  That said, I must admit that the two most believable, most REAL, and affecting moments in the film were their post-coital giggles.  I attribute that to two talented actors getting a momentary reprieve from having to work against some horribly contrived plot device. <br /> <br />My last beef is with the ending <br /> <br />!!!SPOILER ALERT!!! <br /> <br />The reading of the infamous letter at the funeral would have been a good ending for ONE of the 20 films that \\"The Constant Gardener\\" was trying to be.  Itwould have been perfect for the big bloated, glossy, Hollywood film demonizing big, bloated, glossy pharma, with the little guy winning after several exciting car chases and martial-artsy fight scenes.  They would, of course, not have killed off Ralph Fiennes.  He would instead have walked in the door at his own funeral service and read the letter aloud in voiceover while they showed a slo-mo scene of him disarming and blasting the entire carload of mercenaries that came to kill him. <br /> <br />!!!END SPOILER!!!  <br /> <br />Ultimately this film is pompous and unsatisfying.  I suspect the director really wanted to make an art film and but instead tried to force this hack-job schizophrenic story into an art-house hole.  Naturally, it failed.  The two stars I give this film are only for the film's two stars.  Ralph Fiennes is one of those few modern actors, like Cate Blanchett, who is utterly mesmerizing onscreen.   Rachel Weisz is also skilled and subtle. This is a rental for fans, otherwise, don't bother. <br />
B000AL730O|5.0|My husband & I have always been fans of Sir Paul McCartney.  Although I will admit at times we wondered where he was going with something, he has always remained a strong musical force.   <br /> <br />We had the great honor to see him in concert and were in awe of a 63 year old man that could still rock with the best.   <br /> <br />His C&C album is truly something to own in your collection.  It is a nice mix of tunes.  As far as we are concerned, C&C should have won the Grammy.  His talent goes well beyond singing.  None of the other albums (with the exception of probably U2) can come close to his accomplishments.  I know Kelly Clarkson didn't write, compose, play all instruments, & sing her album.  We feel Sir Paul was cheated out of something that is supposed to epitomize true musical talent, but I guess he has one of the longest/oldest musical recognitions and biggest bank accounts to show how much his music is still loved.  Not to mention that long after todays manufactured \\"artists\\" are long gone, Sir Paul's music will still be shaping musicians futures. <br />
B000BJS4SU|2.0|I bought this CD after reading Guitar Player Magazine's review of it, in which the writer said that John Mayer's playing was very Stevie Ray Vaughan like.  Well, I respectfully disagree.  This is a somewhat decent starting point for John Mayer to step out of that horrid acoustic pop balladeer image.  I personally was never a fan, but like I said, after reading that review, I had to hear for myself.  I am not saying I'm a blues expert, but it has always been my favorite genre of music by far.  The SRV influence in Mayer's playing is obvious, but with the exception of a couple of covers, this is not a good blues album (I'm not including the songs off of Heavier Things in this as those are obviously not an attempt at blues).  It's typical John Mayer, pop lyrics, with average blues riffs behind the words.  And as for the SRV comparison, yes they both play Fender Stratocaster's, but SRV's sound is raw and gripping, Mayer's is not.  Mayer's is just that typical Strat sound that everyone has.  Now I saw Mayer play at the Grammy's twice (once acoustic and once electric), and I'm not saying he isn't an impressive guitarist, he is, but this album does not come close to his potential.  First he needs to get some of the right lyrics, or cover the right songs and then he needs to find that raw sound that he should have if he's going to try and imitate SRV's playing style (Mayer's sound is just not raw).  I think this is a good album for anyone who wants to say, \\"Hey, I like the blues.  I got blues cd's in my catalogue.\\" and not actually be fans of the blues.  I wanted to give it 1 1/2 stars, but Amazon only allows for whole numbers, so I was generous and gave it two.  Like I said, Mayer is a very impressive guitarist, and he's got the voice of Jonny Lang, almost, so I'm interested to see what his next blues venture will sound like, I won't buy it, but I will borrow it from the local library to give it a listen.
B000E97X66|5.0|When Bruce Springsteen performed this concert in 1975, he wasn't a rock superstar, but he was on the cusp of becoming one.  Long renowned as a live act and a critic's fave, he had yet to match that prowess on the charts and was in danger of being dropped by Columbia.  Born To Run changed that and he became a phenomenon landing on the covers of Time & Newsweek simultaneously.  This show at the Hammersmith Odeon has long been a favorite of bootleggers and this version superbly remastered for a fantastic sound.  Unlike many live albums, this is not a compilation of performances from various shows, but a complete show as it was originally performed.  The performance captures what it must have been like to see the E Street Band in its glory days.  From the opening with a subtle \\"Thunder Road\\" that spills into a fiery \\"Tenth Avenue Freezeout\\" and continues into a free form jazzy \\"Spirit In The Night\\" you see three unique and distinct aspect of this versatile band.  Lost In The Flood\\" has a burning intensity while \\"She's The One\\" has a slow build into a rollicking, rootsy rocker.  \\"Born To Run\\" was not yet the anthem it was to become thus it was played early on in the set.  \\"The E Street Shuffle\\" is virtually unrecognizable from the album version.  It is slowed down to shuffling Jersey soul beat and throws in verses from Sam Cooke's \\"Havin' A Party\\".  It is a great example of how Mr. Springsteen reinvents many of his songs for his concerts thus not just recreating album versions on stage.  \\"It's So Hard To Be A Saint In The City\\" has a gritty, street-smart vibe and \\"Backstreets\\" has a mournful tone.  \\"Kitty's Back\\" also has a jazzy feel and in this version the band pays homage to an influence of theirs, Van Morrison by including snippets of his \\"Moondance\\". \\"Jungleland\\" is played with laser sharp focus and practically burns up the disk while \\"Rosalita\\" balances off the intensity with a light-hearted, feel good mood.  \\"4th Of July, Asbury Park\\" is played with a rustic charm that transports one to boardwalk on a summer night and the infamous \\"Detroit Medley\\" is a soul rave-up that the band gives a real workout on.  They charge straight into a killer version \\"For You\\" before ending the show with a faithful take on \\"Quarter To Three\\".  Hopefully this album will spur Mr. Springsteen to start releasing other concerts much like the Grateful Dead and Allman Brothers.  All Springsteen fans would rejoice.that transports one to boardwalk on a summer night and the infamous \\"Detroit Medley\\" is a soul rave-up that the band gives a real workout on.

0800177975|5.0|I saw this movie in a movie store a long time ago, and I have never even heard of it, so curious (because I love all the movies Arnold is in) I rented it, and it honestly is the BEST! It has a lot of humor and action, and the story line is great, it may seem like a cheap story line, but this film is one of the best, I don't see why it wasn't a hit in theatres, I think it is just that they didn't advertise it much, but honestly if you want to see Arnold at his best, BUY THIS FILM, I could never get sick of this movie, it is Brilliant. I have bought my own DVD, and I have been showing it to my friends, and everyone that I know has agreed that it is his best, its just that no one has seen it, so  trust me, watch this movie
B000CCD0HQ|4.0|ZZ Top's third album, Tres Hombres was their breakthrough album and helped make them stars.  The album perfectly captures their blues & boogie Texas sound.  Billy Gibbons' menacing vocals and scowling guitars drive the sound while bassist Dusty Hill and drummer Frank Beard provide a rock solid backbeat.  \\"La Grange\\" starts off with mumbled lyrics over a shuffling beat before driving full-force into a guitar explosion on the chorus.  \\"Beer Drinkers & Hell Raisers\\" is something of an anthem for the band and \\"Jesus Just Left Chicago\\" shows their strong blues roots.  The album peaked at number eight on the charts and is still the band's finest effort.
B0000AXM3R|5.0|Great film, brilliant soundtrack, Deceptively simple in its complexity and highly, highly addictive. I listen to it as I punch the keys. Together with the Argentine's genius Santaollala's score for The Motorcycle Diaries, this is one of the strongest soundtracks in recent years.<br /><br />Yann Tiersen, composer's name. Bravo!
1590581814|5.0|Every word counts in this \\"sunshine noir\\" by noted mystery writer James Sallis.  Drive is that rare thing, the proverbial novel you cannot put down.  Yet, Sallis never cheats by loading up on worn plot devices.  Instead, this slim volume pares the story down to its barest essestials, just plot and character, stripped of artifice.  And drive.  Yes, the story hurtles along, moving fast, but always under control.  Do you think you have seen it all with noir?  If you think so, then you owe it to yourself to pick up Drive.  Sallis uses some familiar devices, but the story he tells and the character he tells it through, the \\"Driver,\\" are new.  Drive will keep you hanging until the last sentence.  That's drive enough for anyone.
B000002AH7|5.0|Wow, I didn't realize how polarizing this one was. I always thought of it as bein' pretty universally lauded like 'Kind of Blue' excepting of course those people who jus' don't get jazz. But I guess I was wrong. Thas' cool, I like readin' other people's interpretions, whether good or bad; allows me to have a more well-rounded opinion myself.    That bein' said, this is ESSENTIAL an' prob'ly ranks among my ten favorite recordings of all time. These pieces are so hypnotic an' dreamlike an' beautifully an' masterfully performed that it puts me in a trance. For me, this ain't even background music or jus' atmospheric tones; this is the kind'a music that you gotta sit down an' really LISTEN to, I mean like devote your attention to. I don't know that I had ever really been engrossed with any classical arrangement until I first heard 'Concierto De Aranjuez' which is givin' what seems to be to be such masterful treatment that it's spellbinding. The piece that stands out to me most though is 'Solea' where Miles' trumpet is followin' that kinda rhythmic dance with the orchestra while interjecting his typical bursts, cries an' wails.     This album as a whole has the ability to jus' kinda float over your senses an' exceed your expectations when you aren't even realizing it. Thas' how Miles is though. 'Sketches of Spain' renews my appreciation for the simple beauty an' enormity of the world around me. Thas' as plain as I can put it.
B00003CXIY|4.0|Some of the scens really make me laugh! One that you can watch several times and it's still funny.
B000E1155E|5.0|Some of the reviewers on here seem to have arrived at their negative decision review BEFORE listening to this album, it's the only conclusion I can draw. Here's an idea; forget all the so-called hype surrounding this album, put it in your hifi system and just LISTEN. You *should* hear an amazingly exciting debut full of energy, amazing songwriting/lyrics, great playing, originality and perhaps most of all FUN! And if you haven't seen this band live (you are missing out), if you don't want to pay mega bucks on ebay to catch them on their long since sold out US tour, then settle for a night in front of the TV on 3/11/06 and watch them tear up Saturday Night Live! And if you haven't bought the album yet, make sure you buy it before the SNL performance because they will probably be in short supply afterwards!!
6305718954|4.0|This is a fictional story about a woman who was given a rosary from a priest who is said to have miracles preformed in his name. After receiving the rosary from her mother, she starts to receive the stigmata- the wounds of Christ. Considering she is a non-believer, she doesn't have a clue to what is happening to her, until the Church sends a priest to investigate her and her story. The more stigmata's she receives, the closes she gets to Christ, the more the priest believes it is really happening and not just an act that she is trying to fool the church. The plot esclates from here, and involves the cardinal in the church who is trying to cover the whole thing up. There is a twist in the end that will leave you guessing right up to the end. The movie also offers two endings for you to see. The movie has good special effects, language, some graphics - for blood , and has some sexual content. Good movie, but NOT for kids or preteens!!
B00005JM02|5.0|This DVD came in my first purchase at Amazon.com with a book.  It was so wonderful that they both came in 2 days!  The DVD was excellent quality and not one of those cheap quality ones where all you get after you open the DVD is a single-sheet inside.  It came with a full pullout of the movie, even though the movie has been out for years.  Wow!  I was expecting it to be a 2nd or 3rd release and not have any extras in the DVD holder. <br /> <br />Once again, thank you Amazon.com.  My grandsons love it!
B000005YZM|5.0|Every song on this album is brilliant. Easily as important as \\"Sgt.Peppers\\" or \\"Pet Sounds\\" as far as albums go, and in some ways, more listenable on repeated playings. I originally became aquainted with this music in the mid '70's via a 2 Lp set put out by Epic called \\"Time of The Zombies\\" which I originally purchased for \\"Time of the Season\\" but quickly became enamored with this band. From the opening of  \\"Care of Cell 44\\", it was apparent that the Zombies were a lot more than a singles band. I have the Rhino stereo version of this on cd and don't plan on replacing it yet. This is one of those timeless classics whereby every song will at one time be your favorite.
B0000B1OFL|4.0|This is a jam packed film with lots of chases going on and lots of action. Mark Wahlberg handles the lead role with confidence and a great performance. This was the only movie so far that I've seen Charlize theron in, but I think she did a pretty good job as a sometimes jittery daughter of a renowned thief. The plot was imaginative (especially since it didn't follow the story of the 60's original) and the crime that takes place is well thought out.
0440180295|5.0|If you are a first time reader of this book like I was you are in for a treat. Kurt Vonnegut will take you on a journey from the disillusionment of war veterans to the mental toll that it takes on  one's mind and finally to the indifference to death and dying. So it goes, is the phrase that is the metaphor for the book. Everytime that someone close to him dies he says \\"So it goes.\\" This effectively captures his indifference to war and death as a result of his time at war. There are some stunning narratives about war that are not worth missing.
B000BKVQTS|4.0|3.5 stars.  This movie isn't so bad once you empty your head of all reason and logic.  It's definitely in the vein of a much campier Sleepy Hollow.  It's not a movie meant to be taken seriously--thank goodness.  But it is painful to see good actors missing the mark.  It a descent film it you have nothing to do, but I'm glad I missed it in the theatres.
B0000013G9|5.0|What a classic CD this is; for anyone who loves hip hop, R&B and rap I think it's safe to say this is its intersection.  I remember owning this as a casette in middle school and playing it until the tape broke!
B000A6T1JU|4.0|Some reviewers have blasted The Warriors for not being \\"realistic.\\" <br /> <br />Well... I think it's worth asking--did The Warriors *want* to be realistic? The movie, for example, has a gang of mimes. <br /> <br />Mimes. <br /> <br />I think it's safe to say that the film's creators weren't going for a \\"realistic\\" story. So, as for the \\"plot holes\\" one of the current spotlight reviewers talks about (like, why they didn't just call a cab or something like that), I think it's safe to dispense with that kind of talk. They don't call a cab because the story is about The Warriors fighting their way home through the streets of New York. That's why. <br /> <br />And, it's a fun story. There's a little bit in the beginning about the story of The Warriors modeling an ancient Greek event. I don't doubt it was the inspiration, but you won't find much that's 'deep' here. The Warriors is just a little bit of 70's campy fun, in the same sort of vein as Death Race 2000 or The Phantom of the Paradise, and there's nothing wrong with that. <br /> <br />Good film, fun story, I can dig it.
B00004RF98|5.0|This movie is a treasure. The songs and dances are classic. They don't make movies like this anymore.
B000060P79|4.0|I'm 57 and my idea of living hell is being forced to listen to Metallica and Iron Maiden. But I love dancing around the kitchen yelling \\"I'm just a kid, and life is a nightmare.\\" The reason I love these songs is *because* they're written from the perspective of a 12-year-old--I get to remember the good parts, and be oh-so-glad that, no matter how bad things get, they don't get as bad as they did when I was 12. If I'm feeling weird, I can stay home and dance around the kitchen, because there's nobody to force me to go to school and be tortured. <br /> <br />No, this isn't the Clash--who I saw live when you pishers were in diapers. But everybody doesn't have to be a genius, especially when they're feeling 12. I adored Joe Strummer, but I don't think he knew how to be goofy. Goofy is good, too.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|Pink Floyd - Live at Pompeii (Director's cut), is simple extraordinary. An amazing ride troughout the Pompeii ruins, led by the uncomparable live music of one of the most emblematic bands ever. I like to watch it the live concert from the special features better.
B00000C3G6|5.0|Yes, I admit, I love \\"Immigration Man\\".  That's the reason I bought the vinyl many years ago.  What I had no idea of is the reason I would love this disc (and wear out 3 copies of the vinyl...) This album has some of the most exquisitely beautiful harmonies and chord progressions of anything in the CSNY (together or apart) catalogue.  \\"Games\\" and \\"Where Will I Be\\" are two of Crosby's most haunting pieces.  The two voices, as always, blend perfectly.  I am so grateful this is on CD! <br />Thank you, David and Graham -- this is a treasure....

Spoke to an Amazon customer service person (in India obviously) who asked me to wait yet another week.  Did that and still no product.  Spoke with another representative (even more Indian) who replaced the order at no charge and overnite delivery (which took two days).<br /><br />LOVE the series once I finall got it.<br /><br />Jerry F.

B00001MXXH|5.0|Ferris Bueller's Day Off is what you'd think to be a silly movie. Consequently, it is quite the opposite. The 'goofiness' of this movie is creative and will keep you laughing!
B000A0GP4K|5.0|I was incredibly pleased by this documentary, and being 26 and at the younger end of Bob Dylan's fan base, I didn't really have a context to put his earlier music into. I'm a big Dylan fan, but it was all my parent's time, not mine. <br /> <br />Watching \\"No Direction Home\\" for me made it much more personal, and gave it an incredible depth. It gave me the ability to personally connect to the music, even though I am far removed from it. The performances were great, the interviews enlightening, and I saw in Bob Dylan everything I had hoped. <br /> <br />Truly a timeless documentary, and definetly worth the time whether your into Folk music history, Bob Dylan history, or even just period history. If anyone was an icon of the times, whether he wanted it or not, it was Bob Dylan...

B000819PKC|5.0|Here we see the group that made disco a great comeback with a notch of electronic and club into their albums and selling over 20 million records over the 1990's and now.  <br />Jamiroquai has made this album a accomplishment if you listening carefully to the tracks.  <br />All of the tracks are for either slow and grooving fillers and guilty pleasure dance music. <br />The album itself still retains their signature sound status and is indeed worth a buy. But this version has only 11 tracks whilst I got a copy here in Malaysia with about 14 tracks. 2 0f which are remixes of Feels Just Like It Should and a bonus track called \\"Time Won't Wait\\". The album is an amazing mix of music styles blended into giving it a all rounder enjoyment for different fan bases. It has a bit of funkified pop, disco, hip-hop, club, electronic, slow rock and house. This album is definitely enough to get you either grooving slow or fast. The first single which is \\"Feels Just Like It Should\\" is a funkified disco hip-hop flavored track that talks about a guy going after a girl in which he is crazy about. The video clip <br />is also fun to watch if you do catch it on TV. But whatever it is. They still have the groove going on. And this album is a testment to their accomplishments to date. So people out there! Give this album a spin and you'll find out why!
0590353403|5.0|I thought that this book was a good book I did not want to let it out of my site. I was so interested in it. I like how it tell's you about Harry Potter's life when he was little and when he lived with his uncles the owl's would get there and send him alot of letters so that he could go to Hagwarts to make some magic but since his uncle would take them away they started to send alot of owls with cards so that he can at least get to read one, until finally his going to be friend takes him from were they were at the middle of the sea and takes him to the bank to get all his money so that he can buy all the supplies that he needs. Well thats all I can tell you. You'll just have to read the book if you like it so much.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I bought this movie before I saw it. Its the first time I've ever done that, and I loved it. Its a great movie. 5 stars for sure. It was just so rediculous, in such a weirdly realistic way.
B00005JNRE|3.0|The Brown children are always misbehaving.  They scare away every nanny that their dad, Cedric (Firth), hires.  He loves the kids, but does not know what to do.  One day, Nanny McPhee (Thompson) shows up at the door, confident that she can restore order to the Brown house.  Another problem for Cedric is Great Aunt Adelaide (Lansbury).  She supports Cedric's family, and has decided to cut off funds if he does not marry within the month.  Despite the obvious choice, Evangeline (Macdonald) - a maid who loves the children, Cedric makes a deal with Selma (Imrie), who will make an excellent Wicked Stepmother. <br /> <br />\\"Nanny McPhee\\" is a movie that will be enjoyed by kids.  It is mostly harmless and reminiscent of \\"Mary Poppins.\\"  Adults may not be as taken with it, but I do not think they will find it impossible to sit through.  I recommend this for DVD viewing.

B000B8QEYC|4.0|If you like Enya and you have them all, then by all means, get this album.   <br /> <br />Amarantine is beautiful.  It's of the same timber as the rest of Enya's albums.  [In honesty, if you find a bit of sameness troublesome then perhaps this album is not for you.]  <br /> <br />There are some variations.   \\"The River Sings\\" has great Bounce.   If I need to find a criticism then ....  I felt that \\"It's In the Rain\\" was a little stilted.  ...but only a little.   <br /> <br />I'll put all of Enya's CD's on shuffle play [that's 4 hours of music] and sit down, happy as a clam, with a good book.  Amarantine is a good addition to Enya's discography.   <br /> <br />...okay, I don't know what a clam would do with a good book, but I'm sure it would be happy. <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I missed most of the series when it originally aired (thanks to Fox).  What I saw I enjoyed, even though it took me a little time to get over my predudiced view of Nathan Fillion as only being a comic actor in \\"Two Guys and a Girl\\" (formerly \\"Two Guys, a Girl, and a Pizza Place\\") where he played the third guy...  Funny, but a heroic type?  Yes!!!!  He is a great actor!  In an ensemble cast of nine he is the lead and he pulls it off! <br />The scripts are stellar.  Buy it and the movie \\"Serenity\\" that was filmed after the show was cancelled.  (What show has that kind of fan base?)  You won't be sorry!
6305657939|4.0|SPOILER ALERT <br /> <br /> <br />The ending of this 118-minute marvel seems an almost foregone conclusion. The bored billionaire did it. However, he and the sexy insurance detective play with each other until the audience is very, very hot. Pierce Brosnan, the billionaire, still sexist from his stint as James Bond, enjoys playing with the lady, Renee Russo. And she, as the tough but sexy Catherine Olds Banning, loses her heart to him, as much heart as such a sexpot character is allowed. In the process, she shows some very appealing nipples.  <br /> <br />The 1968 version, of which this is a remake, starred Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway. In this version, to the socially irresponsible, self-absorbed 90s are ever present. We don't mind not having the suspense, we just yearn to see Brosnan and Russo \\"get it on.\\" Dunaway appears as a psychiatrist who is trying to help the billionaire figure out why he is so socially irresponsible. <br /> <br />Brosnan, as Thomas Crown, is bored, but open to being titillated by a beautiful woman, for as long as he is interested in her. For thrills, he steals priceless works of art from publicly-funded museums. The film makes it clear he can do so, under the noses of   security guards, police, and hundreds of innocent art-lovers. Russo's insurance company insured the painting, so she is looking to recover the irreplaceable, but impossible to fence Monet, and save her employer a bundle.  <br /> <br />What we have here is a film with clever dialog, rich and exotic sets, and loads of sexual tension. One wonders now, after Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, and other corporate heists, just whom Brosnan is cheating in order to support his high-tech heist brigade. How many of his employees are going to lose their pensions or health care benefits over this. He never really, you know, works. But I digress. <br /> <br />Dennis Leary has a character role as the streetwise New York detective, who advises Russo's Banning. As we watch her slowly spiral out of control, risking her job and her reputation, we are kept mildly engaged in the question of whether Russo will fall for him, or Brosnan. Duh. <br /> <br />The film moves back and forth from caper to cover-up. This can be confusing, but who cares? All we have to do is wait for their next move, the next gorgeous set, the next revealing love scene. <br /> <br />The Thomas Crown Affair will keep both men and women interested, for all the usual reasons. <br /> <br />It is a film worth watching, and a great date flick.
B000002UB6|4.0|It would be fair to say that \\"Let It Be\\" is not the Beatles' strongest effort on record, and that as a swan song for the greatest quartet in pop music history that it leaves a lot to be desired. But getting past the flaws, you enter into an impressive (if not exactly stunning) exploration of four musicians staring into the abyss of wildly divergent solo careers and emerging with one final stab at unity, even if it breaks on the waves.<br /><br />To start with, there are problems with \\"Let It Be\\" in its original incarnation (but not as bad as the botched \\"reissue\\" that Naked was a few years ago). Phil Spector's overly lush orchestration ruins \\"The Long And Winding Road\\" (which is better heard on \\"Anthology\\", volume three) and threatens to sap the energy from \\"Across the Universe\\" (which manages to get over just the same as it did on the version available on Past Masters 2). And thematically, the album leaves a lot to be desired; one has to wonder what motivated the inclusion of a throwaway like \\"Dig It\\" when it comes between classics like \\"I Me Mine\\" and the title track. Perhaps Lennon's ego or Spector's misguided attempts to recreate the \\"atmosphere\\" of a Beatles recording session led to the one false step on the album.<br /><br />But there are good things to say about \\"Let It Be\\", in the end: the title track has more spark here than on Past Masters 2, and \\"Dig a Pony\\" is Lennon at a surrealistic height not witnessed since \\"I Am The Walrus\\". The collaberations between Lennon and McCartney almost serve to contradict the fact that they wouldn't be partners for much longer: \\"Two of Us\\" is a masterful look at their shared history (a bond that couldn't last under the strains of creative differences and spouses tearing them apart). Harrison gets a nice solo slot on \\"For You Blue\\", and the take on \\"Get Back\\" is charged with energy.<br /><br />The best songs on the album are \\"Let It Be\\" and \\"I've Got a Feeling\\", which couldn't be more different. Of course, the title track is the one that was taken as an elegy of sorts for the artistic partnership that was coming to an end, but it is more than that. Not quite as couched in \\"peace and love\\" terminology as some of the more flower-power anthems that were already dated by the time this album came out, it makes the case for those sentiments nonetheless and adds a bit of fiery spunk with the distinctive guitar solos. \\"I've Got A Feeling\\" on the finished record isn't quite as sparkling as the rocking-but-collapsable version on Anthology Volume 3, but it still works as a primal look at the way love can set off emotions too big for words in even the most jaded rock-and-roller.<br /><br />And so, with this the Beatles' career came to an end. Imperfect, flawed, marred in parts, but nonetheless an honest look at their final days. It survives not as a great album, but a good album by great artists. If it weren't for the band behind it, this album would be a godsend to struggling bands who could gladly lay claim to the contents. As it is, this is a minor Beatles work, but an essential one. No attempts to clean it up can harm the underlying drive of the album. It is as it was, and that's how it should be.rack is the one that was taken as an elegy of sorts for the artistic partnership that was coming to an end, but it is more than that.

B0002VKZL6|4.0|As one who grew up in the UK with Dire Straits and still regards them as one of the best rock bands ever, I wasn't disppointed in Shangri-la at all.  As Mark Knopfler and I have aged over the years, we've both mellowed, changed moods and tastes and it's as if he knows where I am in my own aging process.  It's his lyrics, always thoughtful, often surprising and that familiar guitar sound, that gives much to enjoy on this album. It's not over-produced and leaves behind haunting melodies to carry around.  Mark Knopfler has a way of making you \\"see\\" his music.  \\"5:15 a.m.\\" becomes a story that you can visualize: you can see the Jag driving up the Great North Road and the working men's clubs.  Kudos to Mark for paying hommage to both the late, great Elvis and Lonnie!  Even if your political views don't quite mesh, \\"Don't Crash the Ambulance\\" is a not only well written but prescient. It's a song that doesn't pull any punches, with guitar and harmonica work that seems out of place with the lyrics but somehow fits so perfectly.  Add: \\"Everybody Pays,\\" Shangri-la,\\" \\"Whoop de Doo,\\" \\"5:15 a.m.,\\" \\"All that Matters,\\" and the catchy \\"Postcards from Paraguay,\\" and you have my favorites.
B000A2W1X2|5.0|This hauntingly beautiful movie has stuck with me ever since I saw it on the big screen when it first came out in the local \\"art\\" theatre in 1997. Superbly cast, acted, directed and filmed, down to the finest detail, even the child, in my opinion was just right for the daunting task of the total story line.<br /><br />In today's cinema the challenge of including nudity and sex seems to be something offered more for either the tittilation of the director, or for the hoped for prurience of the intended audience. It is usually justified by \\"being essential to the story line\\". Lo and behold -- in this film it actually is. The ensuing relationship between the governess and the laird could not be fully understood were it not for the well presented early scene aboard the trysting ship.<br /><br />Perhaps the only oddity I found in the entire tale was the presence of the American character who appeared to have been inserted to meet some Union requirement, and had a slightly \\"hammer to fit\\" feeling about his presence. Otherwise I have often described this as the almost perfect movie.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|WALK THE LINE is the best of this year's Oscar contenders. The movie is an excellently done adaptation of a period in the life of one modern music's greatest artists - Johnny Cash.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix is magnificent. Instead of merely acting out the role as Cash, Phoenix delivers an interpretation of a very gifted man who is tortured by guilt and regret, resentment and depression. His Cash yearns for redemption and peace.<br />Most notable is Reese Witherspoon's performance as June Carter, Johnny's friend and future wife. June Carter stopped Cash from destroying himself, becoming his confidant and his conscience and -in the truest sense of the phrase- the love of his life.<br />This was quite an ambitious role for an actress best known for her light comedy. But Witherspoon surprises us all by delivering an astounding performance.<br />With this movie both Phoenix and Witherspoon advance far up the ranks as serious actors.
0131479415|5.0|This is one of a very few books that I keep close at hand. I really like Mike's down to earth style and plain language explanations of agile development process. I especially appreciated the coverage of topics from multiple angles as apposed to an advocacy point of view. For example, estimating is covered using ideal days/hours and story points. Both are clearly explained and followed by an assessment of the trade off's of each approach.<br /><br />If you're and agile practitioner, or trying to become one, this is the place to start. You can't beat Mike's straight forward approach to agile development.
B000BKVQTS|1.0|Normally, I would have given this movie 2 stars.  The actors did a good job with the script they were given, which wasn't an overly good one.  But, hey, I've seen worse.  The plotline was weak and inconsistent, remarkably unsatisfying.  History was horribly mutilated in this film, however, I was expecting that.  This is, after all, a fantasy, not a documentary.  There still seemed to be some small feeling of wrongness to it, though. <br /> <br />The scene that made me hate this movie as much as I do is the one in which a man kicks a cute, helpless baby kitten into a fan where it is sliced up.  And then another man eats a part of it that landed on his face.  Okay, I know that no animals were harmed in the making of this movie, yada, yada, yada...but that was not just unfunny, it was cruel and disgusting.  I had been enjoying the movie a little bit before this, but could not bring myself to stop crying long enough to enjoy it at all after that.  I haven't been a child in 10 years, but this scene gave me nightmares.  I am an avid animal lover (especially cats--I have nine) and anyone who would script something this horrendous into a movie is depraved.  For this excessive and gratuitous feline cruelty, I would give this movie -10 stars if Amazon provided that option. <br /> <br />This movie is not for the sensitive at heart--or for cat lovers.  (Heck, I know a few dog lovers that hated this movie for that scene.)  If you like that sort of thing, this movie might be just up your ally--if you can stand the weak plotline, horribly written script, and the insane twisting of history.  (The real Wilhem and Jacob Grimm are spinning in their graves, I'm sure.)
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series is wonderful... it has the tongue-in-cheek humor that just keeps you coming back for more.  It reminds me of Harrison Ford's role in the early Star Wars trilogy crossed with Mad Max.  I LOVED it.
B00005YU1O|5.0|This movie is a continous chain of people giving their philosphy on different subjects. But they are not all about philosophy. Some are poems while others are funny stories. Whichever way you look at it, it sure is a trip to see actors drawn out like that. It really paves the imagniation highway. I particularly like The Holy Moment scene. It's funny. Enjoy!
0385337388|5.0|Although frequently exaggerated in it's archetypal depictions of usual \\"hospital characters\\", a lot of what is described rings as true today as it did \\"back then\\".  The hours aren't that different, either (at least not at my institution and various others from what I hear from my resident friends at other hospitals). <br />This book is really hilarious and made me absolutely ROAR during times when, as an intern, I had hit some lows.   <br />I lovingly called this book (in addition to biking to work) my \\"survival\\" strategy for keeping sane. <br />It's a must read for any intern.  Enjoy - and don't take it too seriously! <br />
B000002IKR|5.0|Every single song on this album is a thrash classic. Some of the best guitar playing ever is on this album. Alex Skolnick is a guitar god. There are some serious kick a$$ solos and riffs on this album that you won't be able to get out of your head. The lyrics are awsome too. The songs about breaking outta prison, the occult, fighting, the occult, evil stuff, witchcraft, the occult etc. Even if you don't like thrash metal, you will love this CD. So buy it right now!
B000002KON|5.0|When I had the opportunity to meet with Ray Davies a decade ago after the Kinks played the \\"House of Blues\\" in LA, it was the \\"Arthur\\" album I chose to bring to have Ray sign. A masterpiece from beginning to end.
0380788624|1.0|Gratuitous glorification of the dehumanizing ways of the military and the church, full of clichs, demeaning towards women... <br /> <br />If you manage to not be bothered by all that, then yes the plot isn't too bad. But with thousands of better books out there, it's still a waste of time. <br /> <br />One last warning: if you have any respect for Alan Turing, be aware that this book insults his memory. Shameful.
B000002VCQ|5.0|Vintage Whitney.  You're not a music lover if you don't own this album.  On this album, Whitney's at her best --- a level, vocally, very few (maybe Betty Wright or Minnie Riperton can top her) artists of any generation can hold a candle to. <br /> <br />R&B contemporaries & future R&B aspiring stars, listen to this album!!!!!  Notice how there's only 10 tracks & they're all of \\"out of this world\\" quality. <br /> <br />If you can't make an album close to this in quality, you shouldn't be in the business. <br /> <br />Whitney's debut is pure fire!!! I actually got back into this album in 2005 ... it came out 20 years earlier when I was in second grade and I can remember learning & singing \\"Greatest Love of All\\" among classmates back in the day. <br /> <br />From the pop-candy sounding \\"How Will I Know\\" to the inspirational \\"Greatest Love of All\\" to the deeply soulful \\"You Give Good Love\\" to the smooth grooves of \\"All At Once,\\" this was Whitney coming out to the world -- Janet Jackson and MaDonna were the other megastars of the day and she just totally destroys them vocally here. <br /> <br />We all know Whitney's well chronicled, shall we say, \\"issues\\" ever since. <br /> <br />But if she ever gets herself back together again, I'd love to hear her try to top this LP. <br /> <br />This album takes me back to my childhood when true \\"singers\\" sang while male & female strippers posing as \\"singers\\" knew their place (LOL). <br /> <br />Classic, classic, classic album. A must have for true music lovers.

B00005JNX0|4.0|Though I don't consider this movie on top like Finding Nemo of Monster's Inc, I do consider it an all around good family movie!<br /><br />I was a little disappointed in the computer graphics. The humor was funny and even adults would be able to get a lot of the humor. The kids would, of course, love the animation along with the music.<br /><br />I say buy it!! You really cannot do wrong with it!
B000AMJG4Y|3.0|For those looking for photo-realistic, CG animated eye candy, this film has it... sometimes. Visually, it has a hard time topping it's predecessor, Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, but in a way, I don't think it was meant to be as uber-realistic as FF:TSW. <br /> <br />The environment and characters are styled in an 'anime-come-to-life' approach and at times, you have trouble believing it's not real... however, those times are fleeting. Luckily, the action sequences are fun to watch and make up for the lack of realism. <br /> <br />Now, if you're wondering why I only gave the film 3 stars, it's because the English subtitle translation was horrible - which in turn, made it nearly impossible to follow the storyline. At times, the words fall beyond the boundary of the screen or are a jumbled mass. This doesn't happen often, but it does happen.  <br /> <br />I've heard rumor that an English dub was coming soon, so you may want to wait for it, unless you just want something cool to look at. Besides, you will miss out on a lot of visuals if you're busy trying to decipher the sub's, as I did. <br /> <br />I'm sure fans of Final Fantasy had no trouble following the story, but for us non-fans, it was difficult. And, just for the record, I used to watch Star Blazers and Voltron religiously as a child, so don't think that I'm just a dumb-founded American. ;) <br /> <br />Honestly, if I hadn't seen FF:TSW, I would have been completely lost... so I recommend watching that film first, if you haven't already done so. <br /> <br />My last complaint is in regards to the music. It's not that the music is bad, because at times it's actually pretty good. The problem is how the film presents the music.  <br /> <br />Typically, a music score is used to emotionally enhance a scene, accenting the highs and lows. In Advent Children, someone presses the play button and leaves it on till the song's over. This is a common problem with anime-type films. There is no musical editing, just 'jamming' throughout the entire scene - if it's needed or not. One might think this isn't such a bad thing, however, scenes that could have been amazing are quickly reduced to mediocre because of it. Had this film been musically edited by a professional, I would have no problem giving it 4.  <br /> <br />5 Stars for visual presentation <br />-1 Star for subtitle translation <br />-1 Star for lack of musical editing <br /> <br />Final recommendation: Rent it and wait for the English dub.  <br /> <br />
B000002KK2|5.0|I just played my new copy of this 1979 album on CD and was delighted with the excellent vocal performances of the American singer Rickie Lee Jones, an artist the bulk of whose music was not previously known to me. Though, as a radio listener from the late 70's onwards, I was well acquainted with her cool, jazz-styled tune Chuck E's In Love (#4 chart hit, 1979), which remains her most well-known commercial release. However, I did not know just how richly-talented and expressive Ms. Jones was until today when I heard the other 10 songs on this album, her recording debut. She has some beautiful, wistful moments mixed in with terrific storytelling and some coolly seductive poses. She sounds like she can sing anything well. And, I note that she wrote all 11 titles herself, which is great, because I really rate singer-songwriters most highly. <br /> <br />One other thing: This lady has a refreshingly-different way of singing words and phrases that defies convention and sounds like her own unique style. The songs in general also don't tend to follow verse-chorus-bridge-chorus structures either, and this makes for a more-interesting and less-predictable album. <br /> <br />I really like this, and am awarding it 5 stars !! <br /> <br />
B000AP04FG|1.0|Interestingly enough, this plot was made into a movie several years ago using real actors. Prizzi's Honor, with Jack Nicholson and a then scrumptious Kathleen Turner was smart, sophisticated, funny, and surprising.<br /><br />By contrast, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, little more than a vehicle for two well recognized faces, is dumb, puerile, drab, and almost frighteningly predictable. The meager hopes of this packaged Hollywood frozen dinner rest exclusively on the shoulders of its co-stars, and any alleged \\"chemistry\\" between them. That there is none dooms the effort, even the \\"hot reconciliation scene\\" in the kitchen looks staged and false, creating enough warmth perhaps for a weak cup of tea but not quite enough to poach an egg.<br /><br />Angelina Jolie's lips seem to be on the verge of taking over her entire face, while Brad Pitt, who still looks like he's about 12 years old, is unconvincing in a part clearly written exclusively for him. Viewers are expected to forgive far too much in this glossy bubble of vapor. The plot is beyond ludicrous, the performances lethargic, frequently the scenery threatens to walk off with the movie.<br /><br />Mission Impossible settings and a pretty darn good car chase prevent one from going to sleep, but cannot redeem this effort. Those who would defend it by saying, \\"It's not La Strada, for heaven's sake, it's just an action adventure thriller\\", are forgetting that thrillers are supposed to be thrilling.
B000BBOUU4|4.0|The version with Gene Wilder will always be my favorite, but this remake is pretty good and is better suited to this generation of movie-goers.  I'm a Johnny Depp fan, but I think other fans will agree that the 'voice' he used for Willy Wonka was just plain weird if not creepy.

B000002KLP|5.0|Do you like Foucault? Do you like James Brown? If you don't own a Prince album, get this now!!!! \\"When You Were Mine\\" has to be the coolest breakup song every recorded, and all the rest of the songs are as good. THERE IS NOT A BAD SONG ON THIS ALBUM! The sort of aesthetic Prince is preaching here isn't heard too much nowadays, which is sad. Every zeitgeist has its prophet, and Prince definitely saw the 80s in all its glory and perversity.
B00005JL0I|4.0|What a blast from the past - but I'll discuss that in a moment. First, remember the James Bond phenomenon back when Bond meant Sean Connery. It was all about adventure, masculine style, and suave coolness as people thought of it then. In other words, so seriously self-important that spoofing was only a matter of time. This certinaly isn't the only spy-spoof from the time, but ranks as one of the greats. With David Niven, Peter Sellers, Orson Welles, and Woody Allen, it ranges from the dry to drippy with satire. The story gets a bit loose and hectic towards the end, but that's hardly the point. It's just a big budget goof on a then-familiar franchise.<br /><br />In addition, it's a time capsule in video form, of the psychedelic 60s. The women were all young and mini-dressed (when dressed), in a range of pastels normally seen only in Easter baskets. Special effects were opticals and photo negatives - trippy, but naive by today's standards - and Op Art was still a going concern.<br /><br />In the generally straight-faced sendup, Woody Allen was the only off note, conspicuously trying to be funny instead of simply doing it. He played the only character he can in a relatively early form, fresh from the standup format and not yet aware that movies are different. The saved him for the end, though, and he did a fair job of creating the final surge of goofiness needed to bring this movie to its satisfying end.<br /><br />//wiredweird
0967851408|5.0|It's elementary, my dear Watson...one might conclude, and surely enough be correct, upon having completed this book.  But, sometimes what should be most obvious is the most difficult to grasp.    The bottom line to the message in this critically important book is that it's within our power to live the life we choose to live.  We take this at face value, yet fail to apply this great truth to mold our lives.  Why is this so?  I think it's due to our own resignation to 'believe' that we can truly be as we choose to believe to begin with.    Perhaps we've been too jaded by messages and suggestions that we're not worthy, and are 'destined' to be less than we can dream.  The sources of such messages is not important, eliminating their negative influence is all-important.  This book will help you accomplish this and much, much more.    If you're serious about going to the source of your potential, then get this book.  Study it and make it a part of you and you'll never second guess what lies ahead for you.

B000003CMB|5.0|With several expanded versions of the Allman Brothers' famed 1971 Fillmore East shows available, the original album might not top everyone's wish list anymore; but since EAT A PEACH (which contains most of the remaining Fillmore performances) is still an essential purchase for its studio tracks, non-completists would do well to grab this version, which neatly fits both LPs onto a single disc and sounds, to my ears, at least as good as the latterday double-disc editions. With the original edits and all audience shouts intact, AT FILLMORE EAST proper will likewise appeal to purists - and everyone else - as it has for nearly thirty-five years. An absolutely top-tier recording, in any case; if you don't have it yet, get it any way you can.
B00005NTP2|5.0|Europe has quite a catalogue of impressive material for a somewhat unknown band, but Prisoners in Paradise is my favorite album.  It is a lot more power-pop sounding than the 80's material, but the songs are so full of energy and so catchy and well-written, that this album is irresistable.  I have owned this album since I was in the 7th grade, and I still listen to it all the time.  It is really incredible.  The only song that I don't particularly like that much is Bad Blood, which is a little corny for my liking, but the rest of the album rocks.  Songs like Got Your Mind In the Gutter, All Or Nothing, Halfway to Heaven and Talk to Me are loaded with energy, and Prisoners In Paradise and Homeland raise the bar on power metal ballads.  This is very enjoyable, and I would definately recommend this to fans of Bon Jovi, Poison, etc.  Joey Tempest has a great voice, and Kee Marcello's guitar work is pretty good (not his best, but still damn good).  This is one of my favorite albums that I own, and I still listen to it quite a bit, I haven't gotten tired of it yet.  If you're into 80's hair metal, this is one album you will not want to miss.
B000274THQ|5.0|I have lived in Germany, and my wife is from East Germany, and she and I both loved this movie. It is funny, sweet, relevant, charming, intelligent...did I say funny?  The lead actor is appearing in a lot of good new movies, including \\"Ladies in Lavender\\" with Julie Dench which is also great.
B000002UEB|5.0|Calling Operation Mindcrime a great concept album is like calling Purple Rain a great soundtrack, or Raging Bull a great sports movie.  You'd be right, of course, but you'd be missing the point.  There don't need to be qualifiers like \\"concept\\" or \\"metal\\" when referring to Operation Mindcrime.  This is a great work of art. <br /> <br />The story that Queensryche so deftly plays out before us, is a good one.  It is complex enough to keep our interest, but not so much that it leaves us scratching our heads.  The characters are few, four in all:  Nikki, Mary, Dr. X and Father Williams.  We get a glimpse into their motivations, but much is left unsaid.  The plot moves along:  Nikki, a disillusioned young man, gets recruited into an underground terrorist organization as a hitman.  The organization's leader, Dr. X, keeps him occupied with work and clouded by heroin.  He performs his job well, and after a while he falls in love with a teen prostitute named Mary.  There is a priest (Williams) who has taken her in and may or may not be in love with her as well.  His involvement with the organization is likely, but unclear.  Before long, Dr. X orders Nikki to kill the priest and Mary, the former of which he does with no problem.  The latter he struggles with.  In this struggle, which takes place throughout the epic and haunting \\"Suite Sister Mary\\", is the heart of the tale.  In the Hollywood film version, the two would go on the lamb, eventually repenting for their sins and ultimately killing Dr. X and destroying the terrorist group along with him.  That possibility is hinted at here, but the reality is much more grim.  The final act of this story involves Nikki wandering the city streets alone, one eye looking out for his former associates, but mainly cycling through anger, frustration, sadness and self-loathing brought on by the fact that Mary is dead.  All the while, presumably, going through heroin withdrawal.  He ends up in a mental institution, off of smack but still doped up on meds, where he remembers the whole thing clearly for the first time. <br /> <br />The entire concept could have turned disastrous in its execution, but Queensryche pulls it off beautifully. The band provides a dark, brooding soundscape full of fog, rain-splattered cement and flickering street lamps as the backdrop.  Yet, the guitar work is at times soaring (\\"Speak\\", \\"Spreading the Disease\\"), and this is clearly not background music.  It is cinematic and passionate, and still lies in between rock and metal.  Geoff Tate, proving that he is among rock's greatest vocalists while recalling the tale as Nikki, lends our protagonist a sympathetic and bitter voice.  How can a junkie hitman be sympathetic?  Because he is the unwitting pawn in all of this.  His passion in the beginning tells us that he believes in what he is doing.  His grief in the end tells us that he truly felt love for Mary.  All the while, his actions were manipulated like a puppet.  Dr. X, of course, was the main puppeteer, but even 16-year old Mary pulled Nikki's strings.  \\"You're precious cross is gone.  It made me wait so long for what you gave to everyone!\\"  It can even be argued that she was the one who convinced him to shoot her when he had every intention of running and attempting to assassinate Dr. X.  As you realize how he was controlled, so surely does he, now locked away for life while Dr. X moves on to the next disillusioned kid. <br /> <br />I could go on for pages speculating on the symbolism that ties together sex, religion, drugs, violence and politics in Operation Mindcrime.  Such is the tapestry that Queensryche weaves in this album.  It truly is a masterwork, the type of effort that you realize immediately is the pinnacle of the artist's career.  Queensryche has made, and may go on to make, memorable and enjoyable albums other than Mindcrime, but nothing is ever going to touch it. <br />

B00005JO1R|5.0|Since I base all of my major life decisions on Hollywood's example and guidence, I have come to the conclusion that if I am going to ever make a name for myself I need to go through what I'll refer to as \\"my addiction phase\\" and \\"my cheating on my wife phase\\".  This has become obvious after watching the delicious duo of \\"Ray\\" and \\"Walk The Line\\".  I currently am not in the mood spiritually or financially to pick up a draining habit, so I guess wedding vows be damned.  I look forward to seeing my life on the silver screen and providing the opportunity for a young actor to win an Oscar.  Hopefully they can somehow work in that prosthetic extension from Boogie Nights to inflate my box-office receipts and ego.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Every single album by them is amazing, his voice is really good, the guitars are heavy and the rythem is amazing, you people who think that godsmack sucks must be high. Recommend all of the albums by them. They are amazing, quit being haters and really listen to them.
0679409920|4.0|He wrote them so well. Even though this plot exists in a cold war context and apartheid in South Africa provides the chief motivation of the central character, this work's clear-eyed writing and well-constructed action engage the reader still. It's Graham Greene's sensibility that keeps things fresh. His understanding of ambiguities, ironies, and vast areas of human behavior can be seen everywhere. What the world considers heroes and villains are not so easily reduced to such simple formulations in Greene's world. The government must defend the nation, even at the expense of its own citizens. Lives are expendable. The fascinating realm of espionage is vastly treacherous, and otherwise nice, bland, even literary human beings are capable of lies, betrayal, and murder. Some  are \\"company\\" men, and like so many businessmen, they are loyal to the company's mission, and will make whatever sacrifices are needed to ensure order and safety and reputation. Dr. Percival, for instance, does his job well. He could just as easily be a senior VP in any Fortune 500 company. The worst thing one can do to undo the company's mission is to form attachments. Greene quotes his favorite author, Joseph Conrad, \\"I only know that he who forms a tie is lost. The germ of corruption has entered into his soul.\\" It is Maurice Castle who is attached, while others around him are organization men living in secrecy and suspicion. The joy of Greene's books is to feel the characters come alive. These are people who, back in the 1970s, still cared about literature and what people like Tolstoy and Trollope had to say. The Everyman edition is well designed, and a handy timeline in the front places this work in the context of Greene's output. An excellent introduction by Peter Kemp helps us understand the roots of this work and Greene's struggles with it.
0792833201|3.0|I didn't kind this movie to be scary. I imagine this movie is considered scary because it was fresh and terrifing BACK THEN. If this film were released now, i doubt it would be a \\"horrifing thriller\\" if it were released now. People remember it as scary because nothing like it was out.Tobe Hooper did an excellent job though.  I was only scared once during this entire movie. Sure, that wonderful shot of Carol-Anne in front of the TV in the night is super-creepy, but thats it. The clown scene was not all that scary, but when the little boy finishes looking under the bed and the toy is right there, I jumped. But, i was never actually SCARED. I was suprised. In fact, not to bash on this movie, but I was more scared in Three Men and a Baby when the \\"ghost child\\" appeared. <br /> <br />   This movie is very entertaning. It is perfect for watching on TV on a lazy Saturday afternoon. I really enjoyed myself, but it is not what it is supposed ot be. I find it wierd i'm now one of those people who watchg horror movies to pass the time, but this does it for me.
B000B8I8X2|4.0|The CD will have songs that any metal fan will enjoy, no matter how hard the music you listen to is. A mix of death, nu, and classic type metal with some punk rock thrown in their for kicks.  <br /> <br />The Dagger: 8/10: Some great parts, some bad parts. A pretty heavy song with a singer (Howard Jones) who can actually sing and growl.  <br /> <br />The Enemy: 10/10: This is metal. Fronted by Chimara vocalist MArk Hunter, my second favorite song of the Cd and one of its heavier songs.  <br /> <br />Annihilation by the hands of God: 7/10: Death metal at its purest form, not my favorit but still worth listening to.  <br /> <br />In the Fire: 7/10: Some very strange vocals by the ledgendary King Diamond, a good song overall but not one of my favorites. <br /> <br />The End: 7/10: One of the more classic metal songs on the CD. Softer metal for the more casual fan.  <br /> <br />Tired N' Lonely: 7/10: Similar to the end with a more classic feel, albeit an entirely different singing style.  <br /> <br />Independent: 10/10: Absolutely Love it! Sung my Max Cavalera, former frontman of Sepultura, lyrics and music gel incredibly well into on the the collections most impressive songs.  <br /> <br />Dawn of a Golden age: 5/10: Just a strange song sung by the leader of cradle of filth, the single strangest band in existence.  <br /> <br />The Rich Man: 8/10: Lots of scrarming for the Nu metal fan.  <br /> <br />No Way Out: 4/10: This isnt metal. Worst song on the Cd in my opinion. <br /> <br />Baptized in the Redemtion: 10/10: Now this song is metal. By far the best song on the CD, bringing the new together with the old, creating what is now my new favorite song.  <br /> <br />Roads: 6/10: Another psuedo metal song, ill pass.  <br /> <br />Blood and Flames: 8/10: A throwback to classic rock, not too loud but loud enough to be metal, good for a listen from time to time.  <br /> <br />Constitution down: 8/10: Another mix of metal and classic, has its high points and low points.<br /> <br />I Don't Wanna be (a superhero): 7/10: Punk rock, stands out a little but has its fair share of metal influences.  <br /> <br />Army of the Sun: 7/10: Some nice metal influences meld well with the classic stuff. <br /> <br />No Mas Control: 8/10: Christian Machado(Ill Nino) shows a side of his vocal ability that ive never seen, getting in some nice grows and screams along with his natural singing ability.  <br /> <br />Enemy of the State: 6/10: Another soft song to close off the Cd...not one of its bright spots in my eyes.  <br /> <br />Overall, a good buy for any metal fan as some of its songs are bound to suit you.
0783225849|5.0|My Grandmother was  about 30. She was a big fan of The Alfred Hitchcock show. Her brother invitied her to the film, telling her it was basically a long show. Now, her brother, my Great-Uncle, was a trickster. he knew grandma was a scardy cat. She left the film directly after the shower scene. She stood in the lobby and waited. The pulsating violins could be heard all through out the lobby. She said it was the only time was truly though she was going to die of Fear.  <br /> <br />   And that is the power of this movie. She is still haunted from this. I know many other people who are the same. This i a rare classic where it is scary now was was FREAKING SCARY back then. No other mainstream movie had ever featured a tranvestite serial killer, or such real terror. The fear is real. The mood is eerie and classy, the victims are kind and pretty, and the killer is seriously sadistic and possibly the devil. This is based on the true story of Ed Gien, but truthfully this is worse. Edddy killed 2 people. Norman has killed who knows many, as well as every womans willingness to take a shower while home alone.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|I can not praise enough this album. From the thunderous Judas Rising, cosmic Revolution, infernal Hellrider (the guitars... Ahhh..), to the dramatic Eulogy and Lochness... This is a masterpiece...I am sure more people will agree in 10 years time...
B0009SOFGI|4.0|I agree with the people who said that this isn't the best Stooges album.  It isn't.  And out of the big three (this, Raw Power, and Funhouse), it's definitley the worst.  But it's still good music.  The thing I love about The Stooges was that they were so original for the time (and superior to MC5, who we're they're \\"big brother\\" band apparently...whatever).  They're music was sloppy, distorted, whiny, but there's something inventive, spontaneous, and melodic about it too.  Whether or not The Stooges (and other bands like them) fueled the fire for the punk rock movement is arguable, but they definitely drove rock into a direction that it hadn't yet explored.  And I think that alone should merit respect from all rock fans. <br /> <br />As for the album itself, the highlights are definitely I Wanna Be Your Dog, Real Cool Time, 1969, and Little Doll.  But the other songs aren't terrible either.  Even the 10-minute track We Will Fall, which I am not a fan of, is still an interesting experimentally creative effort to do something different (almost sounds like Pink Floyd) and again they deserve respect.  The Stooges made great music.  Period.  It was like nothing else anyone heard of, and has as much rock pioneering credibility as Led Zep, Black Sabbath, and The Doors.  If you like Funhouse and Raw Power, get this.  But if you don't have any Stooges, get the other albums first.
B00002E224|5.0|Before Sunrise is one of those films that really is set apart from most of the \\"romantic\\" films that have come out of Hollywood. The movie examines the process of falling in love rather than the typical fall in love - deal with the consequences format that most movies have. It is a film that highlights the excitement of the beginning of love between two people. I would highly recommend it as well as the sequel \\"Before Sunset\\".
B00007GZR5|3.0|Many books affect me emotionally. Some books inspire me. But very few books change my outlook on life. Richard Matheson's \\"What Dreams May Come\\" was one of those books. <br /> <br />This movie is a pretty faithful adaptation of that wonderful, wonderful book, but it is very simplified. Its depictions of the afterlife also fall into much more conventional \\"Heaven and Hell\\" ideas when compared to the book. A lot is lost here. Robin Williams is the great every-man actor, so we can all identify with him through his journey. He was a very good choice. However, the character's profound love for his wife is the driving force behind the story, and when our protagonist lacks any sort of charisma or chemistry with his onscreen wife, things just don't work. That's the case here, sadly.  <br /> <br />Over all, this is a good movie, but I reccomend that you read the book first.
B000BNI90O|5.0|This is a Must Have for all fans of the film and of Howard Shore's beautiful score. Some of the best bits which were left off the soundtrack cd can now be enjoyed over and over - Gandalf singing \\"The road goes ever on and on\\" as he rides into Hobbiton; the merry jig played at Bilbo's birthday party; the hauntingly lovely farewell to Lothlorien from the extended film version, plus more besides. To listen to the music is to relive those parts of the film; this is where Gandalf and Bilbo sat smoking their pipes, this is the part where Boromir made his opening speech at the Council of Elrond and the ROTK theme was first introduced. The film becomes alive in your mind as you listen to the music. <br /> <br />It's wonderful - beautifully presented and reasonably priced. If you're a LOTR fan and you don't buy it, you'll be kicking yourself forever.
B000AXSN5G|4.0|This is a light, dark, introspective tour through the mind of Neil contemplating his mortality. It's an image-filled attic that takes you for a great ride. Lots of good cuts, some pure inspiration, and minimal filler material. If you love the way Neil's mind works, Prairie Wind provides more of the picture. Some great sounds, too!
B0000019PA|5.0|I was late to the Elephant 6 party.  This CD really paved the way for everything that is good about modern music, but I can't think of one that equals it.  Mangum, release more albums now.
B000053V7Q|5.0|Elvis at his best...this DVD showcases the many talents of the King, his humor, love of his fans and of course his awesome vocals and physical talents (i.e. dance moves).  It's also good because there are interviews of some of the guys in his band, whom are rarely ever focused on, like James Burton and Ronnie Totts.  If you love Elvis this is a must have for your collection.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|There is something terribly sad about this film. McNamara's life as told here was one of accelerating acheivement, you can still glimpse in the way he talks and the way that he thinks that here is a ferociously intelligent man who can analyse any given problem. The way he describes how he analysed problems at Ford and during World War Two are microstudies of how an intelligent person deals with something- by cutting to the detail that matters and dealing with that, by knowing the right questions, asking them and finding out the right answers and then turning that into an acheivement in the real world. But come to Vietnam and here is what I found so sad- because the essential tale of this film is how a series of very intelligent men got it completely wrong. How a series of the most intelligent people in the planet almost plunged us into nuclear war because they were playing chess blindfold according to rules they didn't understand. What McNamara's lessons are there to show are not the banality of politics but its unpredictability, what we don't understand is more important than what we do. Coming out of this film is an almost Hayekian distrust of the acheivements of intelligence in the face of the complexity of human life- none of those carping on these message boards about how McNamara could have done better understand the central message of the film- the problem wasn't with McNamara and Kennedy being crooks or thick it was with the very structure of modern politics and the impossibility of taking decisions wherein so many variables are involved.
B000009QPO|4.0|it says it right on the the sticker they put on the cd \\"the jayhawks are an astonishingly(sp?) easy band to love.\\"  it is true.  they are a great band they are my second favorite band right behind tom petty & the heartbreakers.  i love this cd it is not their best(tomorrow the green grass and rainy day music are both better).  but this album is still about as close to perfect as a band can get.  the song \\"clouds\\" has one of my favorite opening lines of any song \\"the God of the rich ain't the God for the poor...\\"  also the song \\"settled down like rain\\" is just fantastic and is probably my favorite song of all time.  i am very suprised no one else has mentioned this song.  they tend to single out \\"take me with you(when you go)\\", \\"waiting for the sun\\", and \\"nevada, california\\"  which are all great songs but still not as good as \\"settled...\\"  basically this album is great and i can't imagine anybody not enjoying it.  it is a classic one of the best albums i own.
B00005JNJV|5.0|Director:  Christopher Nolan <br />Cast:  Christian Bale, Michael Cane, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, Ken Watanabe, Morgan Freeman. <br />Running Time:  141 minutes <br />Rated PG-13 for intense action violence, disturbing images and some thematic elements. <br /> <br />The last time we saw Batman in action he was wearing a rubber suit with nipples, had Elle Macpherson for a girlfriend, strolled around a neon-infested landscape, and fought ultimate evil in the form of Arnold Schwarzenegger (his weapon of choice being puns). Things were not well in Gotham. Eight years later, DC Comics and Warner Brothers, weary of constantly being left in the dust as Marvel chalks up win after win (the glorious \\"Spider-Man\\" and \\"X-Men\\" franchises), return to the silver screen with the definitive caped crusader adventure, \\"Batman Begins.\\"  Unable to seek revenge over the brutal murder of his beloved parents, billionaire/heir Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) leaves his privileged world behind in disgust, only to end up in a seedy Asian prison fighting for his life. Bruce is rescued by a mysterious figure named Ducard (Liam Neeson) who offers the lost soul a chance to join his clan of ninja, led by the enigmatic Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe in a cameo). Bruce agrees, and is soon tutored in the ways of stealth, honor, and justice. Fearing his home of Gotham City is sinking under the weight of corruption and crime, Bruce returns to Wayne Manor and sets up shop, building a bat suit and assorted crime-stopping toys with the help of a tech genius (Morgan Freeman) and Bruce's trusty butler, Alfred (Michael Caine). Stalking the streets of Gotham at night, looking to stamp out crime through intimidation, Batman/Bruce finds greater evil coming as the fear-mongering Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy, \\"28 Days Later\\") begins his nefarious plans to rid the city of whatever harmony is left in the streets.  <br /> <br />Written by David Goyer (the \\"Blade\\" trilogy), \\"Batman Begins\\" is a confident origin story that starts this new franchise at ground zero. The film is a polar opposite experience from the Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher series, which trafficked in pop culture and cartoon-like adventure to provide big-budget entertainment. \\"Begins\\" returns Batman to his dark, comic book origins, trusting the audience to be patient while cautious director Christopher Nolan (\\"Memento,\\" \\"Insomnia\\") painstakingly builds and arranges this shadowy cinematic world from scratch. Those accustomed to the sweetened thrills of the earlier films are in for a rude awakening with \\"Begins,\\" for it desires to construct a solid initial base for the character, not paint the town red with gags and style in a quest to keep the story mindlessly moving forward. Nolan's film handles exactly like 1978's \\"Superman,\\" which also took its time getting the audience used to personalities and the locations. Goodness, it takes a full hour before the film even hands the audience some actual Dark Knight action. However, patience is rewarded with a full-bodied representation of Wayne's journey from cowardice to heroism, taking its time ensuring that the leap into the fantastical isn't a disruptive one, along with setting up a nice tone of heightened authenticity in Wayne's transformation into Batman (seen in Bruce's fear of bats and desire to intimidate his enemies). The film may not reflect reality, but Goyer and Nolan do a terrific job capturing verisimilitude for Bruce and his bat world. <br /> <br />The theme of \\"Begins\\" is fear, and how it can affect all creatures regardless of might. From Bruce's conquering of his demons to become Batman to the Scarecrow and his deadly fear toxin (which paralyzes victims into a state of horror), the idea of fear is worked to the bone in \\"Begins.\\" Since the movie is not afraid to get chillingly sinister in tone or cinematography, Nolan milks the idea of terror well, seen often in the macabre distorted images presented in the Scarecrow's toxin-induced hallucinations (which makes the picture not terribly appropriate for young children). \\"Begins\\" isn't even close to the light fare that Schumacher brought the series in back in the mid-1990s, which was layered with camp and one-liners. Nolan's film is more fierce and demonstrative in brood, which gives the film oodles of gravitas and energy, helped along significantly by the propulsive score from Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard, which oddly eschews traditional heroic themes.  <br /> <br />Boasting an all-star cast of grand acting talents, \\"Begins\\" gives every actor plenty to work with, and the fun is written across their faces. Also appearing are Gary Oldman as the friendly cop Jim Gordon, Katie Holmes as Bruce's childhood friend, now Gotham D.A. Rachel Dawes, Tom Wilkinson hamming it up as mob boss Carmine Falcone, and Rutger Hauer as Wayne Enterprises chairman, Richard Earle. The supporting cast works dutifully fleshing out the \\"Batman\\" experience, but the center of attention is Christian Bale, and he deserves heaps of credit for making \\"Begins\\" come together as expertly as it does. Taking a role with dubious lineage, Bale reinvents the Bruce Wayne character, making him a person of action and crafty intelligence, not of words. While Bale has expected trouble trying to emote trapped in a restrictive rubber costume, the actor dives deeply into the role, and is a deciding factor in the film's successful grand design to strip the franchise down and piece it back together differently. It's wonderful work here from Bale, who gives Batman authority without winking and the outfit realism without much assistance from special effects. The tone of the film stresses practicality while retaining a comic book mood and nothing spells that out more than the film's final moment, which superbly sets up the villain for the inevitable sequel.  A rip-roaring, exceptional entry (or newfound expansion) of the DC comic fame and one of the better action films in recent memory.

1577314808|1.0|Hard to read with drifting off to sleep in sheer boredom. My therapist (who recommended I read this) even said the whole book should have been a 15 page pamphlet. He was right. I got about 4 times further than that and realized my nightstand was filled with books to be read far more important, interesting and relevant than this. Tolle covers his own ass by saying at the outset that people with reactions like mine were closeminded and unenlightened. Whatever.
B000E1YVZU|1.0|I went to new york for a drama field trip with my high school last year.  Ofcourse, when you have a bunch of drama geeks in new york, the first thing you do is buy broadway tickets.  For us, they were RENT tickets.  Even with a couple of guys that flinched at the thought of a musical, every single one of us fell in love with the show.  Naturally, when the movie came out, we all rushed to a theatre to see it.  And i have to say. . .  <br /> <br /> <br />THE MOVIE IS HORRIBLE.  Was the director on crack while he shot this?  The movie completely ruins the magic of the show we saw on broadway.  Do yourself a favor, don't watch it.  Everyone of us who saw the broadway show hates this movie.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|It's hard to believe that this movie almost was not released in movie theatres, maybe it's labelling. <br /> <br />In the movie is a great part when Donnie Darko says \\"life isn't that simple, you can't lump everything together in one category\\" and that's exactly what the problem with movie. Well, a problem for some anyway. <br /> <br />It's a scifi story in that it deals with time-travel, but not the \\"what will happen when\\" kind. It's a very very dark psychological drama too. Often we say that people with a mental disorder live in a different world, but DD really does. <br /> <br />I don't want to say too much about the storyline, you really have to see it for yourself. <br /> <br />Great roles for Jake Gyllenhaal and his sister, Noah Wyle (from ER) and Drew Barrymore. <br /> <br />Bad review, I know, sorry about that. Too much going on in the movie. Warning: for some it can be really scary, nightmarish even.
B000000W5H|3.0|'It's Only Rock n'Roll' released in late 1974 would see the Stones fully enter their autopilot stage. Mick Jagger was the dominant one in the band as Keith Richards was in the depths of his narcotics addiction. A good but not great album. Am I missing something here because it seems that most reviewers damn 'Goats Head Soup' and praise this barely above average record. Hell I once rated this four stars myself but if 'Soup' is a comedown from 'Exile', the 'IORR' is a comedown from 'Soup'. Classic cuts such as the legendary title cut (forever immortalized by the sailors bubble video), \\"If You Can't Rock Me\\" and \\"Dance Little Sister\\" sit beside filler like \\"Short and Curlies\\" (man what a lousy song), the ponderous \\"If Really Want to Be My Friend\\" and the lame \\"Til the Next Goodbye\\". Other decent songs include Mick Taylor's last guitar masterpiece featured in \\"Time Waits for No One\\". Most Stones fans will note that this was Mick's last lp with the band, fed up with the dominence and monopolizing of the song writing credits of the Glimmer Twins (who's first production chore this was). Not a bad album and much better than 'Dirty Work' but I'm sorry not as good as 'Soup', not possible. Love the cover art though, conquering heros! \\"Working so hard, working for the company\\". Yeah right!
B000E6UWE4|4.0|This book doesn't have the depth of characterization of say George RR Martin, but it is A LOT of fun to read.  The plot is brisk and you will always have fun reading this book.  There are a lot of subplots that are melded seemlessly together and it's great fun to see all the characters shemes running into the schemes of other characters.  You will not be dissapointed if you buy this book.  The only flaw is that the sources of magic and their relative power is not explained well so you never really know whos magic is greater than another's until the plot tells you through confrontation.  Gods seem omnipotent one moment and powerless the next.    Otherwise a great fun read that you are sure to enjoy.    Edit:  Having read a few more books in this series since my initial review and havinf just re-read Gardens, I think this book is even better than I originally thought.  The reader of this book only gets a small glimpse of all the things that are going to happen in Erikson's world in the upcomming books.  The breadth of this series is staggaring (in a good way).  This series is not easy to figure out.  All the factions, characters, races, sources of magic, gods, and the way things work are not all spelled out for you.  The reader may struggle to understand how the basics of Magic work and why one faction is fighting another.  But it does eventually all come together and the answers all are given to you.  Just don't skim read because the explanation you have been waiting 400 pages for might be given to you in a conversation that lasts 2 paragraphs.
B000E1ZBH2|4.0|I own the BBC version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and I must say that both films were good in their own rights.  I do believe that anyone viewing either of these two fine films must judge them as such instead of comparing the two.<br /><br />I will admit that this version has proven to be a favorite of mine between the two (I watch it at least once a week - gotta have my dose of Darcy *grin).  For one, this version was more \\"romantic\\" to me - Darcy helping Lizzie into the carriage, Darcy watching Lizzie on the ballroom floor, etc.  This really assisted in making Darcy's sudden proposal to Lizzie more believable whereas in the A & E version (not comparing, merely pointing out) - I was surprised by the declaration of love because I didn't see it coming.  There were no obvious signs that Darcy held any affections for Lizzie other than an occassional glance here and there.  In short, Firth and Eahle lacked the chemistry that Knightley and McFayden had in this version of the film.  Although I absolutely adore Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy - it took me a minute to warm up to him as he initially came off as a snob.  Matthew Macfayden portrays Darcy as more of a man who although he possesses great wealth, he lacks simple social skills.  I fell in love with the sweetness of his face and the scene with him walking across the field as his long coat blows in the breeze accompanied by that gorgeous music...*fanning self frantically  His walk, his voice, and his magnificent physique combined have made me stand up and unashamedly declare that MATTHEW MCFAYDEN IS \\"THE\\" MR. DARCY!!!<br /><br />Also, the fact that this film was slightly over 2 hours as opposed to the other, longer versions of the story was a definite plus to me.<br /><br />For those reviewers who wish to harp about the clothing being wrong for the time period or certain behaviors being unacceptable and unheard of for that era...give it a rest, please!  I am an avid reader of historical romances and an avid viewer of period pieces, most with romantic themes, and I'm here to tell you that when I'm in the mood for a good romance - I could care less if the heroe's cravat is knotted incorrectly for that time of the evening during that particular time period - I'm more concerned with a good romance!  And this version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" delivers just that!  A beautiful and romantic tale!  Now if Mr. Darcy had decided to deal with Lizzie's rejection by flopping in front of the t.v. to watch reruns of \\"The Golden Girls\\" I might have had issues.  *laugh  You get my point though - those details are minor.  In the end, it's the story that counts.<br /><br />I would DEFINITELY recommend to anyone looking for a sweet romance and a wonderful film.<br /><br />p.s. I mistakenly hit four stars when I meant to hit five!  Amazon doesn't allow you to change your rating for some odd reason.  *shrug  Trust me when I say - this film is all of 5 stars!!!tic themes, and I'm here to tell you that when I'm in the mood for a good romance - I could care less if the heroe's cravat is knotted incorrectly for that time of the evening during that particular time period - I'm more concerned with a good romance!

B00000IQC8|2.0|No doubt I'm going to  get smacked up and down for saying this but, \\"What is all the HYPE about?!?!\\" I agree with one user who said \\"This is quite possibly the most over-rated film of all time.\\" Sure, this is an indie flick that was basically Kevin Smith's audition for Hollywood, and if that's where it ended, I would judge it simply on that basis. But the fact that this has become a cult hit just baffles me. There are a whole lot of indie films out there made for less money that beat this into the ground. But hey, I can't diss everything about it...there are, in fact, some very GOOD things. The plot is fun and off-beat, the characters are sick, twisted and morally bankrupt, even the dialogue ain't all the bad. But that's where the good stuff ends. Since Clerks is now considered a \\"hit,\\" let's judge it based on those terms. The acting is horrid. Unbelievably elementary. Auditions, anyone? The best acting involves Jay and Silent Bob standing outside the store jacking around. Anything with dialogue is on par with your local Jr. High School play. And the sad part is, had Smith edited a little better, he could've at least improved the dialogue a little. It seems like they did about two takes a scene -- most of which were long running dialogues with a locked-off camera -- then apparently gave themselves about a day to edit the whole darn thing. The entire film is a compilation of two-shots...they rarely cut to someone reacting to what another person is saying, and the term \\"over the shoulder shot\\" seems to be lost on Smith. The shots are flat, most dead-on straight, the camera finds nothing interesting in the scenes, nor does it work hard to put the scene in context or create a mood. These guys went to a lot of work to create something that looks like it took no work whatsoever. In short, A for effort, given that he was a new director and had no cash. But this should've remained exactly as it was meant to be: an application form for Tinseltown. For my money, Smith should've stuck to writing, and left directing to people with eyes.ve stuck to writing, and left directing to people with eyes.
0151001634|5.0|I assume most people read \\"Flowers for Algernon\\" as high school students. I never did and recently decided I would catch up with all the literature I missed from that formative stage of life. To the book, I have formulated the opinion that all these stories are better consumed as adults than children.  <br /> <br />On the surface, the story swirls around Charlie Gordon who was born retarded and is chosen for breakthrough brain surgery to increase his IQ. The book infers part of the reason for choosing Charlie is his positive affable attitude and desire to please. The authors decision to construct the book mostly of the patients journal entries serves to provide \\"structure\\" and context while liberating the writer to craft a tender, thought provoking and sometimes frustrating tale.  <br /> <br />I could not ignore a slow rythmic beating starting with the first post-operative romantic conflict right through to the last words of the story. Though I am not an overtly religious man I felt the author was trying to make a statement regarding mans heavy handed \\"fumbling\\" with the mechanics of love and intelligence and the relativity of which is superior. I left the story, quite shaken but with no question as to the quantatative and qualatative impact on the universe of both.
B00005JOHC|5.0|I wanted to reply to the review written by US maven \\"Alan\\":  I live in the US and also bought the DVDs of the first season \\"Two and a Half Men\\" -- but I also bought a \\"Region-Free\\" DVD player.  There are several good ones available from Amazon.com and they allow you to play DVDs from anywhere in the world.  As long as you've already bought the DVDs, why not invest in a \\"region-free\\" player so you can enjoy them.  The players aren't that terribly expensive.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|This movie was great.  The performances and well everything was so close to the broadway play.  Maybe better.  The only thing is that the voices were a bit off on some spots.  However, the actors were great.  I didn't think you could make the phantom look attractive and yet be such a monster.  It is a must see.  If you liked the play, you will like the movie.  If you haven't seen the play, you'll still enjoy the movie.
0307276902|1.0|After reading the Smoking Guns article in regards to Mr. Frey's \\"novel\\", I decided to borrow his story from the library rather than line his pockets.  As a high school English teacher, I think stories of inspiration are important for our youth.  However, upon reading this piece of poorly-written, bawdy, profane trash I wonder why the rest of the country continues to support this man.  The most common response is, \\"Even if it's not true, it still tells a good story.\\"  There are countless authors out there who are trying to tell their good stories the honest way, but are kept down because con-artists like Frey cheat their way to the top.  My recommendation is that you read what the Smoking Gun has discovered, and then discover for yourselves what kind of person James Frey really is.  Let legitimate authors find space on our book-store shelves; not con-men out to cheat you.   <br />Note how the author gains sympathy for himself by writing about the death of his girlfriend.  In actuallity, he is writing about the death of a girl in his town that he had no relationship with, but changed circumstances surrounding her death to steal your tears.  One of many examples of a man with no angel sitting on his shoulder.  He recently was dropped by his agent, dropped by his publishing company, lost his movie deal and denounced by Oprah (the person responsible for putting most of your hard-earned cash into his pockets).  What more do you want?  Does he have to personally pour sugar into your gas tank before you stop buying this book?  We've all been duped by Mr. Frey.  Time for us to deliver the most damage by forgetting he ever existed.

0743454529|4.0|I've been wanting to read some of Jodi Picoult's books and decided to start with this one because I wanted to find out why everyone was so upset over the ending. Well, I was disappointed at the end of the book too. So much so that I was screaming \\"WHAT\\" when I read how it all turned out. Needless to say, I did enjoy the book. Kate Fitzgerald has been battling a horrible form of leukemia from toddler years to her teen years. When she is first diagnosed, her parents; Sara and Brian, find that their son; Jesse, is not a match to Kate so they decide to \\"make\\" a child that is a perfect match to Kate. Enter Anna, who has been poked and prodded since the day she was born to save her sister Kate. After years of this, Anna decides to seek the help of a lawyer; Campbell, to become medically emancipated. From there, the book goes through this heartbreaking situation that will surely bring tears to your eyes. Each chapter; so to speak, is written from a different person's perspective jumping back and forth from past to present. As a mother, I found myself torn between Anna and her parents. This is definetly a thought and emotionally provocking book.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|Set in the 1960s and 1970s, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN presents the tale of two emotionally conflicted gay men, a painful love affair, and the emotional wreckage visited upon them and their families over the course of two decades.  A remarkably complex and serious film, it is greatly buttressed by Gustavo Santaolalla's quietly effective score, which includes several haunting instrumentals, a few original songs, and a number of songs from the period.<br /><br />Santaolalla's most effective work for the film occurs in the pure guitar instrumentals: for the most part these are simple chords, sometimes echoed as if from a great distance, extremely evocative of the vast physical and emotional spaces on which the film dwells.  Simple, elegant, and painful, they were powerful additions to the film and they stand alone well on their own.<br /><br />Equally effective are \\"A Love That Will Never Grow Old\\" and \\"No One's Gonna Love You Like Me,\\" both of which were specifically written by Santaolalla for the film.  The first is performed by Emmylou Harris, and she gives a typically flawless vocal that bespeaks of quietly simmerly passions; it has, I think, become one of my favorites among her work, and the Bernie Taupin lyrics are memorable for their great simplicity and sincerity.  In the context of the film, \\"No One's Gonna Love You Like Me\\" is a low-key honkytonk song, something of a musical throwaway--even so, Santaolla nails the period sound; it sounds very much like something Patsy Cline or Kitty Wells might have performed, and vocalist Mary McBride gives it full period charm.<br /><br />The remainder of the soundtrack is a mixed bag of period music, some of it drawn from the jukeboxes of the day.  Linda Ronstadt is an always welcome voice, and her version of Buddy Holly's \\"It's So Easy To Fall In Love\\" is well-selected for this particular story; Steve Earle's \\"The Devil's Right Hand\\" is a classic of it's kind.  Willie Nelson contributes a nice rendering on Bob Dylan's \\"He Was A Friend of Mine,\\" and the Roger Miller standard \\"King of the Road\\" gets a notable overhaul courtesy of Teddy Thompson and Rufus Wainwright; Wainwright also offers the darkly powerful \\"The Maker Makes.\\"<br /><br />Like most film soundtracks, there is little in the way of a unified musical statement--after all, the purpose of the music is to support specific moments in the film--but the score for BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN not only recalls the film extremely well, it does strike an overall mood that bespeaks of love, loneliness, and loss without drifting into cliche.  Fans of the film will find it indispensible.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon ReviewerRoger Miller standard \\"King of the Road\\" gets a notable overhaul courtesy of Teddy Thompson and Rufus Wainwright; Wainwright also offers the darkly powerful \\"The Maker Makes.\\"    Like most film soundtracks, there is little in the way of a unified musical statement--after all, the purpose of the music is to support specific moments in the film--but the score for BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN not only recalls the film extremely well, it does strike an overall mood that bespeaks of love, loneliness, and loss without drifting into cliche.

B000006TRV|5.0|I listen to classic rock.  The Beatles, Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, The Doors, The Who, David Bowie, Cream, Bruce Springsteen are few of the artists that I listen to, but the one I have a special place for is Pink Floyd.  I love them all, but Pink Floyd just has amazing instrumentals, great lyrics, just all in all great music.  When I first listened to The Wall, I thought it was pretty overrated, but when I listened to it again, I thought it was amazing.  I love, on the first disc, Empty Spaces and Young Lust.  In the Flesh and Thin Ice are good beginnings, I also love the precursor to Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2, the Happiest Days of Our Lives.  In my opinion, that is one of the most underrated Floyd songs.  Another Brick in the Wall, Part 3, is short and sweet.  On the second disc, there is the famous and incredible Comfortably Numb, which is one of the best songs there is, Run Like Hell and The Show Must Go On are also very good.  Outside the Wall is a very good ending to the album.  The Wall makes you think in so many ways, about a number  things.  The person who is writing kids reviews, has no idea what he is talking about.  No idea.  The Wall, along with Dark Side of the Moon, Animals, and Wish You Were Here, are great albums.  I will treasure this.
0141439475|4.0|I think that Frankenstein is an instructive book. It was fun reading it, and the story is very well written. You read that the monster is very ugly and therefore everybody is scared of him. I think that you shouldn't have prejudice based on looks. You should get to know someone first, before you judge him or her.

B000B8QEZG|4.0|I'm not one of the fans that's listened to all of Madonna's albums - I have \\"Ray of Light\\" and I have heard some of her earlier hits like \\"Into the Groove\\", \\"Material Girl\\", \\"Like A Prayer/Virgin\\", etc. \\"Ray of Light\\" remains one of my favorite albums of all time. It was deep and trancey. It really towers over this album, \\"Confessions on a Dancefloor\\", but \\"Confessions\\" is a nice comeback. <br /> <br />Madonna's reinvented herself like twenty times and this time she's done well. I've heard that \\"American Life\\", her last album, bombed, but \\"Confessions\\" obviously hasn't.  <br /> <br />Featuring a dozen dance (NOT trance like \\"Ray of Light\\") hits which I admit can seem very stereotypical mainstream dance, but are likeable anyway. I do have some differing opinions from other reviewers, however. I'll go over each song. <br /> <br />1. Hung Up (5:36) B+ <br />Her first single. Truthfully, I don't think it's the best song on the album, but I can see why it's a single. It's catchy, it samples ABBA (and I do not see what the big deal about sampling is), and it features some great music. Sure, that high pitched sound in the chorus from the sample is annoying, but it proves a point. Good song. <br />2. Get Together (5:30) A- <br />Very good - I would have made this a single instead. The ebbing synth effects are great if you realize what I'm talking about. Nice lyrics, nice vocals, very well done. <br />3. Sorry (4:43) B+ <br />Seriously, this should not have been a single. I'm sorry. It's a good song, the apologizing in every single language is annoying though, and it's just not one of the better songs on the album. But it is good - the remixes seem better though.  <br />4. Future Lovers (4:51) A- <br />When the song is at full blast after \\"In the evidence of its brilliance\\" is looped about twenty five times, at about 1:30, the song is amazing. It's very spacey and very cool. Club material for sure. <br />5. I Love New York (4:11) B <br />Madonna shows off her amazing songwriting talents - \\"I don't like cities but I like New York/Other places make me feel like a dork.\\" Yeah, I know, it's not that great, but it's a fine song. It'll get a lot of replay at clubs. The chorus is the best part. It's kind of unneeded though when Madonna tries to be tough in the second verse, though. <br />6. Let It Will Be (4:18) A <br />One of the better songs on the album, all because of that addicting beat. I wish the intro wasn't there and that the song just started off with the beat, but whatever. It's a really good song. <br />7. Forbidden Love (4:22) A- <br />Space sounds at the beginning, and a great chorus. Good. <br />8. Jump (3:46) A- <br />OK seriously, that \\"Popcorn\\"ish sound at the beginning is mixed in from \\"Forbidden Love\\". The rest of \\"Jump\\" is the most disco-ish and retro song on the album. Maybe it's not the best song on the album, but it's a worthy effort. And I'm reminded of my favorite Madonna song \\"Sky Fits Heaven\\" with the lyric \\"I'm going down my own road and I can't make it alone.\\" <br />9. How High (4:40) A <br />One of the best songs on the album. The vocoder effects at the beginning are irritating, but once the beat comes in it's all good. Very, very good. This should be a single. Also, this is the closest to \\"Confessions\\" on the entire album. Saying that she feels like a dork in places other than New York isn't really considered a 'confession'. <br />10. Isaac (6:03) A+ <br />OK, here's the best song on the album. Yeah, yeah, I know it's raised controversy. And I realize that Madonna's not just naming the song after the vocalist at the beginning of the track but the Jewish prophet Isaac Luria. Deal with it! This is an amazing song. It's diverse, has the best lyrics on the whole album, and it's something different from the rest of the album! It was getting kind of repetitive before this track. It's very reminiscent of \\"Frozen\\", with the humming during the chorus, while not as good. I'm sure this won't become a single because it's too long and it's just not radio or club material. But it's a great listen.  <br />11. Push (3:57) A- <br />This is DEFINITELY going to become a single. I've already heard it in music stores. Truthfully, the lyrics aren't that great, but the music is purely entrancing. It could use a sped trance remix badly, but it's a great song anyway. <br />12. Like It Or Not (4:31) A- <br />Very different, and not really club or radio material, but Madonna put this on the album for a reason. This song is dedicated to those who hate her. Through good lyrics and more unneeded bible references from 'Esther', Madonna says basically, \\"I don't care what you think. I like what I do, like it or don't.\\" A great way to end the album. <br />13. Since I don't have the bonus edition album, I don't know the bonus track. Sorry. I'll get it somewhere else. <br /> <br />So basically, this album earns a A-. Madonna has done well again. Sure, the dance stuff can get repetitive, but many of the songs here are perfect for clubs and parties. The name \\"Confessions\\" is somewhat misleading as there's little confessing going on, but whatever. She's done better on previous albums on \\"Ray of Light\\", but this album proves that she can make pretty good mainstream dance music. And diverse songs like \\"Isaac\\" show that she can be flexible in her styles. Keep on going, Madonna! <br /> <br />LAST NOTE: Anyone who likes good dance music with good vocals and lyrics that aren't very cheesy will like this album a lot. Those who despise dance music or are devout Mariah Carey fans will write 1-star reviews and sell this album on Ebay the day they buy it.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|This is a very good soundtrack, especially if you like country music.  (If you don't, you probably won't appreciate this album as much.)  The instrumental music by Gustavo Santaolalla is amazing amd matches the sweeping cinematography of the movie.  I wish his pieces were longer and that there were more of them.  On the other hand, I actually can't listen to this album too much, because it reminds me too much of the movie and I get teary-eyed all over again.
B000E8N690|5.0|Some of the reviewers seem to expect their entertainers to be Boy Scouts. \\"None Whatsoever\\" overlooks that Johnny Cash made a lot of great records.  I bought my first Cash Sun record in 1956. <br />It was I Walk The Line backed by Get Rhythm, so I'm familiar with his music over the years. Phoenix and Witherspoon are outstanding and one of them should win the Oscar.  Regarding Cash's selfishness, self-indulgence etc., he did straighten himself out during the last decade, but most important, warts and all, personality flaws, and so on, Johnny Cash made a lot of great records and he did it for a long time. It's a tough business he was in, but people are not going to sit down and see a movie about a CPA in Cleveland.    This movie reminds me of Ray. From humble beginnings and early rejection , an icon emerges. When it is all said and done, Johnny Cash will be remembered. He made great records! Well done!
B0009I7NNA|4.0|Be prepared for a tight new sound with many changes and transitions that'll throw you off the first couple listens.  I suggest paying close attention to the guitars and mainly the drums to get a feel.  The first three songs on the album seem to run together with Rev's fast double bass keeping the tempo going.  Bat country has some amazing arpegios.  The thing i didnt like about these songs is a few of the singing parts seemed forced and didnt quite fit at times.  There's a lot of harmonizing in this album where M. Shadow's harmonizes with himself.. up to four singing parts at a time... I felt like there were some parts that could've gone without the high pitched, whiney harmonizing.  For those of you who havent heard the Waking the Fallen album, he used to have a pretty good voice until he blew his vocal chords and had to have them reconstructed.  Although the singing is a minor set-back, there are a lot of great riffs here that'll have you saying, \\"hell ya\\".  I especially like the second half of the cd from Sidewinder on.  If your into hard metal then you won't like this album based on the singing.  If you like metalcore then you should give this album a try.  Personally, i like this album and throw it in every once and awhile. Waking the Fallen is what got me into harder music and if you like City of Evil then you should give Waking the Fallen at least a couple listens before judging it... you'd be surprised how the screaming can grow on you if you've never been exposed to it.  The album is absolutely amazing!  Why do people always try and categorize artists?? music is music, no matter what you call it.  Give it a listen (or three).  There's much on this album to be appreciated.
0375507256|5.0|Although this book is a lot of fun to read, it may not please those who delight in fantastic conclusions whereby the amazed reader would find out in the last chapter how all the characters are related.  Those who seek cheap thrills should read something else than Cloud Atlas.  The others will realize that the last page of the book reveals a much deeper connection between the stories; i.e., how we human beings can be the best and the worst of things for ourselves, but how we can rise above our human condition and not be bound to commit evil.  The connection is, as one reviewer stated, the human spirit, and it makes this book not only one of the most entertaining books i've read in a while but also one of the most profound.

I think its definitely worth purchasing and reading multiple times.
0375704027|5.0|My first book by Murakami, recommended by a friend... And a great fascination - I must have started well. This book hit me hard, opened my mind to things which I used to regard as important, but for some time have ignored or have not found time to think about. Now I see they still are important!<br /><br />\\"Norwegian Wood\\" is about what happens deep in the soul, about individual psychological maturation, about struggle to find out who you really are. And some cannot cope with all this burden. It is also about meeting and (sometimes accidentally) getting to know people who would have an impact on who you became. Love is very significant, but this novel is by no means a love story - love is a feeling, which is something the main character, Toru, a college student, has to come to terms with. You could say this is simply another \\"coming of age\\" story, but there is no rebellion against the old, there is only a search to get your own place in the puzzle.<br /><br />There is great depth in this (some say, semi-autobiographical and most realistic of Murakami's) novel. The psychological portraits of all characters (no exceptions) are very thorough, I love their life stories (especially Reiko and Midori) so that I have only a great appetite for more Murakami soon!
B00006DEFA|5.0|One of the most remarkable quality's of Peter Shaeffer/Milos Forman's \\"Amadeus\\", a delightful though somewhat historically slanted film chronicling the career of the eighteenth century Vienese composer and his rivalry with fellow composer Antonio Salieri, is the fact that, unlike many historical dramas, it manages to succeed so brilliantly on so many levels. \\"Amadeus\\" is a film which is extraordinarily affecting: at once a farce, historical drama, biography, and philosophical character study. Though historical purists's may cringe at the elevation of the Salieri myth to historical fact and the irreverent attitude towards Mozart's personality, and though Elizabeth Berridge is pretty badly miscast as Mozart's wench, this nevertheless remains a film of immense allure. For not only does it provide insight, as the cover truthfully declares, into the nature of envy, mediocrity, and someone's (then) underappreciated genius, it is also an invitation into a bygone era of opulent balls and colorful costume parties, an age of royalism and budding artistic renaissance. There is not a single missed note in this movie.
B00006EXL5|5.0|this is the best emo i've ever heard in my whole life. the 1st cd is way better than the 2nd. and no, it's not PUNK or POP, or ROCK, or MAINSTREAM. it's PURE emo. all emo fans will love the holy crap out of this. what i like about them is they have 1 track that's not as dark (headfirst for halos and i'm not okay). but don't go to their concerts. it sounds terrible. <br />this cd is more emo becausee the vocals aren't as good and there's screaming, and it's real dark and it has parental advirory, so hide it from your dad.
0451167716|5.0|Instead its a touching study of parent child relationships (no, I'm not being sarcastic), with particular emphasis on those with humble, immigrant backgrounds. In the context of a crime story, we see through the eyes of the American born son of what basically amounts to Italian nobility (at least as far as the criminal underworld goes), and his desire to assimilate, which naturally causes some friction within the family (he wants to be a college professor, his dad wants him to tend to the Family business-afterall, its tradition!). Eventually however, the son matures and is able to see the train of thought underlying his Old country style father's behavior, and accepts that his father's accumulated wisdom in a lifetime of racketeering has relevance in his faster paced life. Essentially:\\"Woah, dad WAS right afterall!\\", which also happens with a lot of ambitious young American men in the legit business world.  <br /> This kind of veneration of a strong parental figure who has endured hardship and spouts \\"folk wisdom\\" (which invariably proves right) has universal appeal, and exists in many different ways (last time I checked,  it was Tyler Perry's Madea movies)
B00005Y228|1.0|I purchased a copy of this album after a suggestion from a friend.....a few hours later in ended up in the bin.....very dissapointing, bland and not to mention boring and derivative (some people from New York would understand what I mean).  In summary....not only does kylie mingogue (I wont grace her name with capitals) fall flat on cd....she also cannot perform live and rely's on \\"gay camp it up\\" imagery to hide behind (a very cheap and politically incorrect exploit).  A very bad performer and a shameful album.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Now, I think Fight Club is a great movie. I'm all for everyone having their own opinions, but personally I think it's great. Here's my addressal of some of the arguments for why this movie isn't good.  <br /> <br />People seem to think that the movie is morally degraded by portraying violence as a good thing. Well? Nobody's effectively said why it's bad. It has a very cathartic quality to it, and besides which everyone who participated in violence towards other was willing and chose to. Far be it from anyone to say they can't do what they want, if they're consenting, right? Otherwise I don't see why violence = bad, other than our base instinct which shouldn't decide morality. <br /> <br />Terrorism? Do you realize what terrorism is? <br /> <br />Terrorism <br /> <br />n : the calculated use of violence (or threat of violence) against civilians in order to attain goals that are political or religious or ideological in nature <br />Now, as far as I can remember, nobody in the movie dies except for Robert Paulsen. And that was by the police. Everything else was done to empty buildings, causing no harm to any people other than to empty buildings as an attack against consumerism. Hardly terrorism if nobody dies, really. <br /> <br />And the most oft-repeated but most puzzling. Fascism? Do you even know what Fascism is, you kids with your high-school History credit trying to seem intellectual? Well. Effective use of the media to control people? If by destroying media you mean effectively using it than... Maybe? The corporatism and laissez-faire economic policies of Fascism are completely opposed by the message in the movie. And the authority portrayed by Project Mayhem is the goal itself, with the leader eventually kidnapped and is held accountable when he questions the project. Nationalism? Not at all. You'd hardly tell that the movie knew what a country was. Racism? Not at all, there were black members prominent.  <br /> <br />Funny how all these people question the movie as being shallow and repetitive in its message, when most mainstream films/books hardly have any message, let alone question so effectively. And yet these people offer no idea what a good or deep message would be.
B00005ATQD|4.0|The final film by Stanley Kubrick garnered attention for some digitally censored sex scenes but it's not an exploitation film.To be honest this film doesn't really fit into any catagory.Kubrick's great eye for striking imagery and use of lights create a hallucingetic spell for the first half of the movie.Nicole Kidman gives a great fiery performance especially in a bedroom argument.Tom Cruise is underwhelming but his nightime journey to a mysterious mansion is mesmerizing.Some sections of Eyes Wide Shut are extremely creepy but the drama and the eeriness runs out late in the film.Too long and a little too \\"arty\\" it's still a mustsee for any serious filmlover.Visually it's one of a kind creating a dreamworld without special effects and it's a very unique final effort by the world's last great visionary director.
B0006399FS|5.0|I got the special CD+DVD edition of this album last month and I absolutely loved it! I didn't really think that this album could beat their 2000 album, because it was very good, but I was wrong.<br /><br />This album certainly contains songs that I normally don't like: some slow songs, but now I think and those are my favorites. I truly agree with the people who chose the Grammy winners, because \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On You Own\\" is actually my favorite song in the album, and it was awarded with the Song Of The Year prize, it's a beautiful song that when I listened to it in the concert in my country last night I swear some tears started falling all over my face!<br /><br />My favorite song in the whole album is \\"Original Of The Species\\": it's a very beautiful song with an excellent chorus and the lyrics in the whole album are like coming out of a \\"poet\\", beacuse they are very deep and I don't think anyone would have ever thought them.<br /><br />There aren't any \\"bad\\" songs in the album, but they're so different. For example, \\"Vertigo\\" and \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" have nothing in common, and neither do \\"All Because Of You\\" and \\"One Step Closer\\"...maybe that's something that other people may not like, but I really do, variety in the album.<br /><br />The only bad thing I can find to U2's latest album (so far) is that there are only 11 songs...They could have included at lease 13 or 14...<br /><br />In the end: U2's latest album was better than I expected, and it isn't true that the band is going to end after the \\"Vertigo Tour\\", Adam Clayton, the bass player, said in an interview with Universal Music in my country: \\"after the end of the tour (Vertigo Tour), we don't know what's going to happen exactly, but I do know that we're going to make another album, and maybe the tour after it, but following that, I don't know, actually\\"
B00004TFRF|5.0|First off:You're not going to understand this movie...so get over it!Now that you're not going to worry about what every little thing means you're ready to journey into the creepy mysterious realm of David Lynch.If you try to some up this movie for your friends you'll sound like a babbling idiot as this film is made up of bizarre vivid scenes.There's the bonechilling appearance of a whitefaced Robert Blake who simply states \\"I'm in your House\\",there's a videotape creepier than the one in Ring,and there's even a beautiful love scene lit by headlights in the desert.Loaded with sex,violence a great use of music and aural effects and also some funny and even magical moments Lost Highway is truly special.Definitely not for everyone but adventerous viewers will enjoy this mindbending trip down the rabbit hole.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|This album is filled with great rhythms and music, plus Alex Kaprano's voice is really good, something that really helps. Another thing I liked a lot about this band, is the fact that when they play live they sound exactly like in the CD's (yesterday I saw them live, they were the opening act on a U2 concert).<br /><br />I loved each of the songs in this CD, the rhythms are very sticky, and you'll enjoy listening to it.
B000B0WODA|4.0|After bursting out of the gate with a terrific debut album and one of the catchiest songs of the 21st Cenury Take Me Out the group Franz Ferdinand returns with another adrenaline pumping release.Full of songs that will literally plant themselves in your brain for days like Don't You Want To and Walk Away this release is a pure rush that make other groups look catatonic.If you're looking for sensitive Coldplay numbers or Keane piano ballads forget about it!Franz Ferdinand's songs may not have much substance or genuine emotion but they always put a smile on your face and get you moving.You Could Have It So Much Better is a blast that you'll want to listen to over and over.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|\\"Everything is Illuminated,\\" by Warner Independent Pictures, is a fantastic, must-see film. The story follows the tale of the young collector, Johnathan Sanfran Foer (who wrote the novel on which the film is based) wants to learn the history of his family and his grandfahter's birthplace. Elijah Wood gives an impressive performance only complimented by co-stars Eugene Hutz, a Ukrainian pop-star, and Boris Leskin a veteran Russian actor with over 40 years under his belt. Wood's vivacious blue eyes covered in giant old-man spectacles give an insight into the film's deeper meaning. Visually stunning, the film is directed by Liev Shreiber, who debuts his feature film directing skills. He invents a masterpiece with an innovative plot that creates an atmosphere giving an insight into the life of \\"Johnathan\\". The story has a wonderful sub-plot about the history of Grandfather, thus touching on a \\"be proud of who you are\\" motif. Next, the comedic timing is perfect with sprinkled jokes such as Alex the \\"translator's\\" pronunciation and poor vocabulary, or the hysterical dog Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. named after Sammy Davis Jr. It is incredibly difficult to create such an atmosphere and still manage a depressing ending, but \\"Illuminated\\" pulls it off. Although slow from time to time, \\"Everything is Illuminated\\" is a spectacular film without a single unstimulating frame.
0671027387|4.0|Even without religious symbolism and elaborate puzzles Dan Brown knows how to hold a reader's interest and how to use real science and still write an entertaining story.Action fans should take note of this book because it has more explosive sequences than Angels and Demons and The DaVinci Code.This doesn't mean though that it's a  simplistic shoot em up book.The story that starts with NASA making a stunning discovery that coincides with the president's election campaign unfolds like clockwork.Without giving anything away I can tell you it has great twists(Brown is big on trickery)political intrigue,a nice sense of humor and great edge of your seat sequences.The DaVinci Code may be coming to theaters soon but this book is what Hollywood really needs...a smart relentless entertaining suspense/action tale.
0385512104|4.0|I loved this book but it is my opinion that it is definately not for everyone.  My feelings about this were confirmed after reading some of the other reviews.  It seems most people either loved it or hated it, with not a lot of in-between. <br />The reason I am giving this book only 4 stars instead of 5 is because I found that the last part of the book seemed to drag by for me.  I ploughed through the first half at lightening speed but it really started to slow down about half way thru.   The things that I found so cute and funny and ingenious in the beginning lost their luster for me.   <br />Aside from that, I loved this book! I felt that I learned more about autism from reading it.  It was definately different than any other book I have ever read and very charming. <br />
B00005JOFO|4.0|Two cowboys in Wyoming are just looking for work when one day they happen to get the same job herding sheep about Brokeback Mountain.  For a while it's a day-in, day-out job as they slowly get tired of beans, but then, one cold night, they get a bit drunk, they get a bit confused, and the next thing you know they're in love but don't know how to deal with it.  The story follows their lives over the years as they try and manage families, keep their secrets, and yet still find time to see each other despite living in different states and having completely different lives.<br /><br />It's a slow, but beautiful build-up to their relationship, and then once it gets its momentum and finally starts moving, the film just gets better and better.  Compliments, of course, are towards the performers (including the supporting actors) and the direction, and a lot of this films mythic quality is on the absolutely gorgeous shooting of the Brokeback Mountain area, the only really open area shown in the film--obviously because Ennis and Jake feel rather restricted by the normal world around them.<br /><br />It's a good conceit, and a good theme, and tales of forbidden love and social commentary are great too.  Unfortunately, this movie isn't free from its moments of camp... like in the tent, when Jake and Ennis are looking at each other and I couldn't help thinking, \\"But baby, a man's got needs!\\"  Or the shot of the gutted sheep, and all the time it allows around it for one to think, \\"Well ain't ever'one feelin' gutted today?\\"  Or when Jake and his wife are out with the society couple and the woman is talking about \\"Men never ask their wives to dance,\\" and of course the obvious response would be something like, \\"Well that's 'cause I want to dance with your man!\\"<br /><br />I'd cite more examples, but I'd neither want to spoil it or completely ruin it for you, for afterall, unintentional humor aside, the story just keeps getting more and more involving until it finally hits it's real stride, with some pretty unforgettable moments and unforgettable emotion.  Thus it is, in its own way, quite an acheivement.  Even nice little touches like the fireworks behind Ennis when he gets angry at the bikers and some rather abstract shots in the beginning keep this film engaging enough to ask us, gently, to have patience with it until it gets to where it's been meaning to go.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB's real stride, with some pretty unforgettable moments and unforgettable emotion.

B000003TA4|5.0|First of all, all of you idiots who call nirvana overrated are just that, idiots. Nirvana got praise they deserved for being groundbreaking and speaking from their hearts. And for those of you idiots who think he totally copied off the pixies are just that, idiots. While Cobain admitted to using them for inspiration, I'm sure even you idiots can understand that Nirvana has a sound all its own. And Cobains dead, have some respect for one of the greatest musicians of all time.
0192804782|2.0|I was hoping for another masterpiece when I ordered Sense and Sensibility but, other than the eloquent language, it contains none of the charm of Pride and Prejudice. Not a single character in S&S is likeable, and that I find to be a real travesty. In P&P you have the bold and clever Elizabeth and the mysterious Darcy to adore, and even Jane and Bingley have their charms.... but S&S is a dull read, or at least, as dull and the wonderful Jane Austen could muster. I don't recommend it to a Pride and Prejudice lover.
B0000683DH|5.0|I saw this movie when it made it's original theater run and I enjoyed watching it two days ago on this DVD as much as back in the theater.  This particular Trek movie has a great story and perfect pacing.  The story moves along quicly enough to keep the viewer's interest (unlike the first Trek movie) while allowing time for a lot of dialogue and character development.<br /><br />The soundtrack is beautiful. The starship dogfight is about the best space battle scene I can think of.  And, now that I'm approaching the age Kirk was in the movie, I see it all in a very different light than I did twenty four years ago.  It hits a lot closer to home.<br /><br />Finally, the best thing I can write about this movie is that people who aren't necessarily into Trek or sci-fi so much still enjoy it.  It's just a well done movie.  And, the wealth of bonus features just make it a slam dunk decision to buy this DVD.
0393039102|5.0|An unforgettable story of endurance, cruelty and forgiveness. This is a story that stays with the reader, even years later. This is a true story of Mr. Lomax's experience during WWII. He was captured and tortured and almost died. At one time the only thing that kept him alive was practically throwing himself down a flight of stairs so he was transferred to hospital from the dreaded prison. After the War, Mr. Lomax, like many other Veterans was unable to lead a normal life with emotions. Having experienced dreadful torture at the hands of the Japanese he learnt to cut himself off from his feelings, in order to survive. All his life he never forgot the interrupter that was present during his torture, he dreamed of revenge someday. In a miraculous turn of events he mets up with this man, whom it turns out was unable to forget being part of the torture of Mr. Lomax, and it had haunted him all his life. The two men agree to meet, and the most remarkable thing happens they become friends, forgiveness and understanding occurs. This is one of the best books I have read about the POW experience during WWII, it is tragic, and yet has rewarding and true ending.
0553801503|4.0|The story grows deeper and larger with every turn of the page. While I agree with those who felt Brienne of Tarth was a waste of pages the end of her storyline introduces a new character. Maybe not so much a new character as a re-imagined one. I really hope Brienne's story is done but won't hold my breath.<br /><br />And even though Arya and Sansa Stark appear little you get the most important details about them. Remember their children not yet ready to face the world. I've always liked Arya's character more as she is definitely the stronger sister and more Stark then Tully.<br /><br />Samwell's story moves along in bits and jerks but makes for some of the better reading, more so by the characters introduced at the end of his storyline. I find Gilly somewhat annoying and hope she falls to the wayside. Jon Snow is mentioned only as a tiny part in Samwell's story which is too bad as he is by far the best character in the series.<br /><br /> The Greyjoys are an interesting lot especially Euron Crow's Eye. I fear he is going to be a real pain in someone's butt. I do hope to see a lot more of him. I don't think we've heard the last of the Kraken's daughter either.  Aeron Damphair is also an interesting character whom I hope to see more of.<br /><br />As for some of the other secondary characters I'm glad they were introduced. Arianne, The Princess of Dorne and the Sand Snakes need more page time especially now that we know of certain secret arrangements that were made. And mention of Dunk & Egg is made by Maester Aemon. To have these stories finally meet, albeit however briefly, was a big deal for me. All of these characters will play a part in Daenerys Targaryen's storyline. I'm almost positive of that.<br /><br />The Queen Regent and Her twin Jaime seem to steal this book away from the other characters though. Queen Cersei is spiraling out of control with power (She reminds me of \\"The White Queen\\" from Narnia) and with the lose of his sword hand, Jaime seems to be on a path of redemption and I hope he finds it. Admit it you hate to love the guy. I sure missed Tyrion though as he is my favorite Lannister.<br /><br />Yes I find the lineage of every family to be tedious and forget them as soon as I read them but this is Mr. Martin's world. You don't have to visit it if the details bore you. I like to study the appendix of The Kings and Their Courts. It makes for interesting reading between books. It may be half a story with, as far as I'm concerned, the least interesting characters and storylines but how much sense would the story make without it? More lies, more secrets and more self proclaimed kings.<br /><br />It grieves me to put 4 stars up for a book that we are to blame for.

0446677450|2.0|I found the book very disappointing. It came to me with so many recommendations from my friends and i expected a lot out of it, but it ended up being an yet-another meer motivational book. Surprisingly, author is motiviating people to become richer, which i thought people had enough, already.:)<br /><br />I don expect the author to hand out a wisdom for everyone to get richer overnite, but he could have atleast discussed the fundamentals more clearly. Instead, author has felt comfortable going on a rant to explain how good it feels to be rich.<br /><br />I sincerely think that the book has just tried to explain the gap between two different school of thoughts. One being conservative and another being liberal/aggressive. It sounded to be very much lop sided arguments, siding the aggressive mindset.<br /><br />In all the examples, i found that only the positive results were discussed in detail. Even a single mistake in these high (relatively) value deals, can set anyone financially back by a few years, if not decades. Anyone would sign up for those kind of deals, if the results are always positive.<br /><br />Bottomline is that, book lectures in details with interesting and tempting examples to conservative (financially) people on why they should be aggressive. But the author has failed to address how this can be played safely, which is the prime concern of so-called conservative people, if not everyone.

B000A6T262|4.0|I love the idea of having all the Star Trek movies together, even if some of them are really aweful films. And the extra features on all these are decently enjoyable, especially the early films. What I don't get is why each movie is in a double-wide DVD case. They don't come with extensive booklets (most have no booklet at all) and the DVDs are stacked on top of each other in the cases, so this collection really takes up twice as much space as it needs to.

I actually cooked one of the recipes in here and it was durn tasty. I enjoyed it so much, I made it twice. <br />I love the Sopranos, so I'm addicted to picking up anything related.  <br />The book is set up so the characters tell the recipes and little stories to go along with it. <br />Any Sopranos fan will love this book.
B00005JOFO|3.0|The story of \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" -- the love affair of two gay men over the course of 20 years in the American West -- had great potential. Imagine the depths of heart that could be explored by this unexpected relationship, and the frank exchanges about the lies that gay men had/have to live to survive in society. Imagine them helping each other to maintain the veneer of their cover-job marriages, and the anguish of having to pretend to love women they could only admire as sisters. Imagine too how they might share pride at the children they had fathered. Imagine too the silly little cultural references that could be made as these two unlikely lovers lived through that 1960s and disco `70s.<br /><br />But there was none of this. The story, as translated from E. Annie Proulx's short story, was anemic. It was often hard to know what was going on the in the characters' minds. Changes in relationship came without warning or reason. For instance, one minute, the two leads are purportedly standoffish heterosexual cowpokes; then, without benefit of a narrative or visual thread, they are madly in love. This might have been acceptable in the early stages of their relationship. But they were just as inscrutable years later. Neither was I impressed by the scenery, which I found barren and lifeless rather than ruggedly beautiful. The subtext of danger, under which gays existed in the 1960s, was largely and inexplicably absent from the film.<br /><br />There were wonderful performances. Heather Ledger was terrific as the taciturn Ennis Del Mar, and Kate Mara was bashful and vulnerable as his 19-year-old daughter Alma Jr..  Michelle Williams was wonderful as loyal, betrayed Ennis's wife Alma. But Jake Gyllenhaal's character Jack Twist was flat and unemotional. And knocks to the makeup department for some truly unconvincing facial hair!<br /><br />The haunting musical theme by Gustavo Santaolalla was a standout. I wish I could say that the rest of BBM moved me. I couldn't connect with characters who seemed to be completely disconnected from the people and times that surrounded them. Given the incredible press and attention this movie generated, I expected much more. I wish too that I didn't have to risk my \\"bona fides\\" as being broadminded, as I have had to do,  because I am not enthusiastic about this film. A film should be measured on its artistic merits, not on whether it advances an agenda, however laudable.onnect with characters who seemed to be completely disconnected from the people and times that surrounded them.

B000002HAJ|3.0|While this album is derided by many \\"real\\" Cure fans as being too \\"commercial\\", the truth is this album still mixes in plenty of moody sulkers amidst the flashier radio-friendly fare.<br /><br />Are they happy? (\\"Friday I'm in Love\\",\\"High\\") Are they sad? (\\"To Wish Impossible Things\\",\\"Trust\\")Well, they're kinda both. This album swings to each extreme, but spends most of its time in the melancholy middle..hoping for better but expecting the same (\\"Apart\\",\\"Cut\\",\\"Open\\")<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS:<br />The giddy \\"Friday I'm in Love\\" is the most immediate track here and the one that continues to garner the most airplay. It's  3 1/2 minutes of perfect fizzy jangle pop. \\"A Letter to Elise\\" is the other radio hit that stands out amid the album. \\"Doing the Unstuck\\" is the unsung lost hit here. It's zippy pop much like \\"Friday I'm in Love\\" but with a darker edge as the \\"let's get happy\\" chorus gives way to Smith's REAL feelings at the coda: \\"it's a perfect day to throw back your head!..and kiss it all..good-bye\\". \\"From the Edge of the Deep Green Sea\\" finds Smith caught in a relationship that's killing him but he can't get free. (\\"And just as I'm breaking free/She hangs herself in front of me/Slips her dress like a flag to the floor/And hands in the sky surrenders it all..\\") \\"Apart\\" is a languid lament of love gone sour. (\\"He wants to hear her say 'forgive'/but she just drops her pearl-black eyes/and prays to hear him say 'I love you'/but he tells no more lies\\")<br /><br />LOWS:<br />Of the 12 tracks here, \\"Open\\" is one of the worst ways they could choose to lead off. \\"Wendy Time\\" is also rather unmemorable.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />Don't make this the first CD you buy from the band (I'd go with GALORE 1st then DISINTEGRATION) but after getting those 2, this would be a good 3rd purchase.<br /><br />3 1/2 stars
B0000AUHPG|5.0|The Sergio Leone trilogy (Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars more and The Good The Bad and the Ugly) with Clint Eastwood get a lot of praise (and rightfully so)but to me this is the best of Leone's westerns. This movie is filmed on a much grander scale than the trilogy and has 3 fine actors in Robards, Bronson and Fonda.  Casting Fonda as the villain who has no qualms about killing women, children and the disabled was a stroke of genius. The cinematography of the vanishing West and the soundtrack by Ennio Morricone are also fantastic. As Sergio Leone's last western it was fitting that this movie offers a glimpse of the future vanishing frontier. The telegraph and the train which would irrevocably change the west are strong elements here. Cardinale plays a widow whose newly inherited land is sought after by many parties. And Bronson(Harmonica) seeks revenge for a long ago grievance by the main villain Frank(Fonda's character).  The first 15 minutes are meticulously laid out- 3 gunslingers waiting for someone at a tiny train station in the middle of nowhere are special. No words are spoken as the tension builds. You can almost feel the desert sun beating down on you as you watch. Finally brief words are exchanged by Bronson and his would be killers. Instead of making direct threats before the violence ensues the interplay focuses on the number of horses they'll need? The dialog here and throughout is subtle and memorable - someone will soon be dead and not in need of a horse. This is a great western for sure. Definitely in the top 10, maybe top 5 westerns of all time.
0060763280|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read regarding finances.  It all begins with your mentality towards money, not how much money you already have.  You can start with nothing and go upwards.  I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in just being successful!
B00004TLN3|1.0|I was very disapointed.  This DVD is badly edited from TV to DVD.  Most of the faces are cut off around the edges or at the neck.
B00016POFE|5.0|From serene, to heart-breaking to all-out ball-stomping rock, this group does it all. I can't remember so much diversity from a group. And then to hear it coming from a DVD in 5.1 surround stereo, WOW! One incredible DVD from an incredible group.
0312995423|2.0|This is indeed a very weak book. Dan Brown is just selling on the shadow of the Da Vinci Code. Certain authors exhaust themselves very quickly.
0120884674|4.0|this book would be best accompanied by an anatomy book.  To really get a good visual, it's a good idea to review muscle attachments and origin sites in a(n additional) book with color.so My biggest criticism (and it's so easy to criticize) is that while many of the bones are pictured the as the actual size, there are not photographs of the bones articulated with neighboring bones.  I found it hard to side bones because of this.  So, it's a pretty good book in spite of my harshness, just not by itself.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|I too have been predisposed to dislike this hack-job of a story, and it did feel a bit uncomfortable to swallow.  Having watched the BBC version of P&P, I felt as though I were being chased through an enormous theme park, with colors and music (a bit too orchestrated IMO) and what felt like scenes being changed quickly just to give us a scent of what it felt like to live in that time.  All that said, the last minutes of the film more than made up for the condensed montage preceding it. Darcy's delivery of the note was, IMO, more romantic that the BBC version, the following early morning's meeting , along with the concent scenes made it truly worth the while.  If you watch the BBC version, you'll know what I mean.  BBC = two dimensions, New version = three dimensions (in feeling).  And sure, read the book.  I just got done watching Bleak House and have begun trying to read the Charles Dickens book (over 800 pages, no less)...and that might take me all year to get motivated to finish it.
B000BT97AO|3.0|I was SO unbelievably excited when I read a review of this movie in Entertainment Weekly magazine. The author of the article stated that Lisa Henson wanted to attempt to make a \\"followup\\" to 'Labyrinth' my favorite movie of all time! I was so happy that someone hadn't decided to make a straight sequel with the same characters/ideas. I didn't think that would work. But when I read the description of MirrorMask and saw that Neil Gaiman was involved I was ecstatic! I just saw the movie a few nights ago, and as sorry, and almost ashamed, as I am to say it, I was disappointed. I tried extremely hard to love it, but I still think it could have been better. The story was allright, and the acting, and the characters, but what really threw me was the CGI...I'm a huge fan of Jim Henson, and it seems to me if they had used puppets or even hand-drawn animation, this would have appealed to me a little more. I can just picture how amazing the sphinxes would have looked if they had been made a tad more realistic. I even think I would have enjoyed a novelization of this more because I could have imagined the creatures myself...but it wasn't completely horrible. I give it 2 and a half-3 stars.
B000BB1MI2|4.0|I had expected to absolutely hate this film going in as I love the original and was surprised to find I didn't.  Definitely darker in some ways than Gene Wilder's version which I think is why I am able to disentangle the two in my head.  Biggest downside to the film was all of the Wonka \\"back story\\" - totally unnecessary in my opinion and bogged the film down a bit.
B0007XH5OY|5.0|This is the album that started the term \\"Supergroup\\".I have owned the original vinyl of this recording since it came out in about 1968. Used to tell people about this amazing band which was Rod Stewart's debut, singing in a group which included amongst others,Jeff Beck on guitar,Mickey Waller on drums and Nicky Hopkins on Piano.Even John Paul Jones of Led Zep fame plays Hammond organ on one of the tracks. <br />Rod Stewart was a powerhouse and the group were tight and rocked. I think that the only reason that they did not suceed commercially was that Mr Beck has always been one for doing his own thing. At the time this album was released,they were offered recording contracts with Mickey Most but Jeff turned it down to pursue his career in rock. Rod Stewart as we all know, continued to create a career that has spanned almost the last 40 years.This album was released on cd many years ago and I am happy to say that the new remastered cd has been engineered to really show the superb prowess of all the musicians who played in this band. A masterpiece! Take a listen and you will understand and hear the influences on all the \\"Supergroups\\" that followed. If one didn't know better, you could swear that John Bonham is playing drums. An essential part of any serious rock afficianado!
006056251X|5.0|Where else can I begin, excpt to say that Kleyas only gets better and better with every book she writes, especially with her wallflowers series. Evie and St. Vincent's breathtaking story is the third in the series (First \\"Secrets of a Summer Night\\", then \\"It Happened One Autumn\\") and without a doubt the best one to date. Built on the basis of friendship, the series matures remarkably with each installment, always keeping the spirit of sisterhood and friendship intact throughout each. Evie has much to be grateful for in her small circle of friends as her story progresses.<br /><br />St. Vincent has returned from his foiled attempt to kidnap, wed and seduce Lillian Bowman. Beaten and downtrodden, he's not expecting the shy and reclusive redhead that insists on entry into his home. Even more surprising, he's astonished at Evangeline Jenner's proposal of marriage - a marriage of convenience in which she receives sanctuary and protection from her abusive family and he gets what he so desperately needs. That would be money, of course. The daughter of a notorious gaming club owner and a rumored half-wit, St. Vincent never thought he'd be stooping to such a level as to consider Evie's offer. Hard times call for desperate measures, on both their parts, and the two are quickly off the Gretna Green for an elopement of the not-so-heart. Both are determined to maintain their distance, but both are in for some eye opening experiences, ones where prior assumptions and false conclusions about one another will be tossed to the curb. Is it really  possible for a self-professed rake to do a complete one eighty? The chances are good for St. Vincent, and watching his awakening to Evie's not so obvious charms is a wonderful experience.<br /><br />Kleypas's wallflowers series began with an endearing promise, among four unlikely friends, to aid one another in the begetting of husbands. That theme of spirited friendship has prevaled throughout the series and in Evie's story her friends come through for her at probably one of the most trying times of her life. A husband like St. Vincent was no easy cross to bear, a totally debauched rogue with no concerns besides ones for himself, he definitely makes it hard on Evie at times. However, at the same time, no one ever set out to take such devoted and gentle care of the fragile young woman. All but broken by the abuse of her \\"noble\\" family, Evie is frankly surprised at St. Vincent's efforts on her behalf. When he tries to bully her into a position she doesn't like, he's equally amazed at the fiery woman that steps out from behind her shell. Who'd have thought a self-professed wallflower could have such spirit and fortitude? The two are a fun and exciting couple to say the least. The attraction between the two was very well written and the chemistry practically leaped right off the pages, it was so intense. By far the best romantic achievement by Klepas to date. And it brought back fond memories of one of my favorites of hers, \\"Dreaming of You\\" ( Derek Craven, the hero of that book, is briefly mentioned in this current title. If you liked this story line, I highly recommend \\"Dreaming of You\\" too.). The only complaint I have is that there will be a wait for Daisy's story, \\"A Scandal in Spring\\", scheduled for release later in 2006. Keep 'em coming, Kleypas. We definitely want more.come through for her at probably one of the most trying times of her life.

B00000I3JO|5.0|I bought this on CD in 1989 at the age of 14, based on a glowing review in Stereo Review magazine. I could not find it in the small town I lived in, and had to wait until a family trip to Portland afforded a visit to Tower Records, where it was on sale for $9.99. I plugged my headphones into my brand new Sony Discman and was astonished at what I heard--the weary hope of Paul Buchanan's voice; the sophisticated but passionate music; the shimmering and contemporary yet untrendy production; string arrangements to make you cry; the evocative lyrical word-paintings depicting love and hope both lost and found and the way rain looks on a city street at night. This album was a revalation for me. I spent many a sleepless night listening to it on headphones growing up. Most of the albums I bought in the 80's slowly drifted out of rotation, but this one has always been a go-to disc, particularly in the nighttime hours. Almost everyone I have played it for loves it, especially my wife, who finds it very relaxing and comforting. This album has stood the test of time--in fact I think it sounds less gimmicky and dated than their 2004 release. Some people have complained of the simplicity of the lyrics and the repetition of similar themes from song to song. I think that this album is the most effective of all Blue Nile releases at creating images in the listener's mind and imparting feelings and memories that are beyond words, much like an impressionistic or expressionistic painting can say so much more emotionally and experientially than a realistic painting or photograph can. This album is for anyone who has been hurt by love but dared to love again; for anyone who stayed up all night thinking about what they were going to say to her tomorrow--or should have said today; for anyone who wants so despirately to believe in something true and beautiful again; for anyone who has ever watched the world go by from a midnight train and felt the ache of every sleeping soul it passed; for anyone willing to think and feel and love.
0804102988|4.0|The term \\"historical fiction\\" just doesn't suffice as a genre title in such cases as this. We need a more specific phrase, such as the one I've just invented, \\"sweeping historical fiction,\\" or SHF for short.  <br /> <br />When I recommend this book to people, I tell them, \\"it starts so far back that Stonehenge isn't built until chapter 3. And it ends when Mrs Thatcher is prime minister.\\" If that explanation turns them off ... well, then they are SHF readers, and shouldn't try this book anyway.  <br /> <br />If that two-sentence synopsis intrigues you, then ... this is your book. Go to it!
0790729407|5.0|I had never seen this movie and had ordered it for my boyfriend.  While it has a slow start (I am not a huge fan of historically-based films) it draws you in and you connect strongly with the characters.  I highly recommend it...just try to ignore Julia Roberts mediocre Irish accent!
B00005MP58|5.0|Oh what can I say?  I watched it twice back to back as soon as I got it!  I loved the book, and this adaptation is so true to Jane Austin's wonderful novel.  Colin Firth is Mr. Darcy in the flesh.  Jennifer Ehle makes Elizabeth come to life.  They say more with their eyes than with words.  Every character in the book was cast for this movie prefectly!  Mrs. Bennett had me in stitches with her constant badgering and wailing!  If you love Jane Austin, or English period novels or movies, this is the top of the list.  Buy it, brew some tea and disappear into the 19th century English countryside.  You will never regret it!
B00005MP58|5.0|I had not read the book, did not know the story line or seen any other versions of Pride & Prejudice when I rented the DVD last year. What a surprise? I had never seen anything like it. I could not stop watching this movie. I have watched it so many times that I have lost count. Amazing movie, great casting, and unbelievable performances (Colin Firth is awesome, I have fallen in love Mr. Darcy). This is the best movie and best performances I have ever seen.
0743454537|4.0|I am a big Jodi Picoult fan and eagerly began reading this book.  I enjoyed the book very much, as you were able to get insight into each character by the way she wrote in the characters' own perspectives.  This was a very readable, enjoyable book, and it made me think about my reactions as a mother, if I were in this situation.  However, I agree with some of the other reviewers that the ending was not the best way to end it.  I feel that it was a cop-out ending; it really didn't solve the main characters' dilemma at all--it was as if divine(or tragic?) intervention was the only way out of this situation.  I think I expected more from such an excellent, thoughtful writer.
B000E1YVZU|1.0|The movie version is dreadful and very very dated ~ some of the stars [male] resemble Ken dolls in their perfection - Idina Menzel - brilliant performer should sue - terrible cinematography - initially.<br /><br />Try Baz Luhrman's 'Boheme' - much better!!!

B00005U122|4.0|I had the good fortune of catching one of the shows in this tour at the Nissan Pavillion in Virginia in 2000.  This DVD really captures the intimacy of that experience with well-framed shots of the performers interspersed with surprisingly close shots of audience members, capturing their reactions to the music and stage show very well.    The music is first rate, as expected, and is more exploratory than the shows recorded for DVD by David Gilmour a couple years later (David Gilmour in Concert).  While Gilmour's performance can seem a bit sterile at times, the musicianship is better than Waters' in my opinion and, surprisingly, so are many of the arrangements (consider, for instance, the wonderfully realized use of the cello in Wish You were Here on the Gilmour set, culminating in a beautiful cadenza near the end of the piece; in the Waters concert, the same song is played with an electric guitar, rather than acoustic, and it has a semi-distorted effect to it, something I do not agree with).  And this is a good segue to my next point...    Why would Roger Waters be seen on stage with a guy in a velvet jumpsuit wearing an oversized bone necklace?  Doyle Bramhall II may be a decent guitarist, but he's not Gilmour or anything even remotely close.  I had a very hard time taking the guy seriously, especially as he hacked his way through some of the more melodic guitar solos (such as the first solo in Comfortably Numb).  To be fair, he did remain true to the basic framework of Gilmour's guitar sound--he could hit the notes.  But it's not about the notes; it's about how the notes are shaped into these sublime melodic phrases that is the trademark of Gilmour's genius.  This is sorely missed.  The fact that Bramhall draws undue attention to himself through his attire and antics makes it a more pointed omission.    The rest of the band is solid.  John Carin acquits himself admirably in Dogs; Andy Fairweather-Low plays a short, but memorable chord solo in Money; and one of thebackup singers belts out Mother like it was written especially for her to sing.    All in all a worthwhile concert DVD, but it always leads me to replace it with Live at Pompeii after a few songs, which is not necessarily a bad thing.    Highly recommended.
0440418569|5.0|Okay I can easely say that, because they are my favorit books =). <br /> <br />But if you like stuff like the Lord of the Ring, or Harry Potter, you will love this.
B0002S94OS|1.0|The music is awful, cliche', boring, annoying, and makes me angry knowing that people actually buy and listen to this nonsense.  Oh well, I'm sure some of you will grow up someday.
B00005NTJK|4.0|I am a little disappointed with this item.  I bought this to replace my Dad's old benefit cd that I lost, and this one is very different from the original.  While it has many new tracks, a lot of the old classics have been redone.  The tracks are also not in the original order.  If you are looking to buy Benefit, don't buy this new cd, find the original somewhere.  But this one is still good if you like Tull.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|I HAVE TO SAY I WAS DISAPPOINTED AFTER WATCHING THIS MOVIE. I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE A GREAT LOVE STORY- I THOUGHT IT WAS HARD TO FOLLOW, AND WAS BLAH, BORING ON MOST SCENES. THE PREVIEWS ON TV MADE THIS MOVIE LOOK REALLY GOOD, BUT AFTER WATCHING IT WAS A BIG LET DOWN.
B000EHRVP6|3.0|Hostel is a watchable film about two American backpackers who head to a hostel in a European country where they have been promised lots of sex and drugs. It is a setup and they inevitably end up in a torture chamber.  This is where the film includes very intense images and is not for the faint hearted.  However, Hostel is quite unrealistic whereas a film like \\"Wolf Creek\\" is actually based on true events of missing backpackers, so the scenes of torture are incredibly disturbing and much more believable than those depicted in Hostel.      One reviewer on another site said that the good thing about the film is seeing Americans get what they deserve for their over-confidence and the way they think they are so much better than any other nation.  Well, that is one persons' opinion ... but it was kind of fun to see some American teenagers getting their just desserts after all those ridiculous teenage road movies which are nothing but degradation of women.    Hostel is worth a rent, but not sure if it is worth owning on DVD.  Overall, I recommend people watching Wolf Creek over this teenage romp.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is the definitive version of Austen's great novel.  Nobody could ever top Firth, he is the perfect personification of Darcy, he prefectly shows the arrogance, that covers a deep insecurity, you fall for him as Elizabeth does.  I thought the casting in general was perfect, the women that plays Lady Catherine is fantastic, as is the lady that plays Elizabeth's social climbing mother, she nails the part.  I enjoyed watching the new Keira Knightly version and it was fun rating that films characters against the ones in this version and though the new version is very good, frankly this version is the benchmark.  If you love Austen or just enjoy top notch acting and great period films then you will love this A&E version...absolute great film

B00011F5DK|5.0|We'd never heard of this game before friends sent it to us, but our kids (ages 3 and 7) took to it immediately. It's one of the few games we can play as a family that lets our 3-year-old play on his own, without an adult overseeing his moves. And yet it's intellectually stimulating and fun for his sister -- and the adults, too! We recommend it highly.
0671027387|1.0|I just got finished reading this book and found it an arduous ordeal.  It's one of those books where you hope that it will get better but does the opposite.  I found by self thinking during the book \\"what a bunch of made up unbelievable junk\\". The book is full of bad McGuffins stupid and transparent plot points that are thrown in just to justify other unbelievable things that are going on or coming up in the book.  It like a Star trek episode where when something happen and luckily you have \\"tetrion omitter\\" to help solve the problem. Bad writing is bad writing.  I also got very tired of the Scooby Doo villain aspect of the book.  Where you're throw one red herring after the next to make you think it someone but a transparent switch-a-roo at the end to make you go \\"gee it was Mr. Wilson in a rubber mask after all\\".  Give the readers some credit for some brains will you.  I've read the Di Vinci Code and thought it was a decent mystery thriller, but his book is a piece of trash.  I have to agree with one of the other reviews that it was a poor 1st or 2nd draft that the Mr. Browns publisher got into print to ride the wave of his popularity.  My guess is that if it wasn't for Mr. Browns current 'cashie' this book would never had made the light of day.  I regret buying this book and regret more on wasting my time reading it.  Please read something else, don't waste your time.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|Being overseas I had to wait for the DVD to come out to see the movie, meanwhile being subjected to a great number of reviews that said the movie couldn't hold a candle (or light one) to the stage performance.  I saw the stage performance once in 1999 and fell in love with Rent madly.  I've worn out three CD's in the 6 years since listening to the soundtrack in the hopes to see it again. <br /> <br />Of course the magic of the stage is hard to transfer to the big screen, I have yet to see a Broadway production that went to film and was considered better than the original.  Yes, some items were cut and some things were left for the deleted scenes, but I think the film capture, maybe even better than could be shown on stage, a lot of the minor details and subtlties of the show.  Especially with the enviorment it presented. <br /> <br />As for the DVD as a whole, the 2nd disc is something not to be missed.  I knew a vague history behind the origin of the story and Jonathan Larson, but after watching the documentary, the story in Rent opened up a lot more. <br /> <br />The 2disk DVD is a perfect buy for fans of the movie, and fans of the show.

006056251X|4.0|In 1843 London, extremely reticent, probably the shiest of the four Wallflower pact members, Evangeline \\"Evie\\" Jenner knows she must find her courage if she is to keep her avaricious relatives from fostering her off in marriage to a man of their choice in order to control the fortune she will soon inherit.  Evie figures she needs a brave person immune to the taunts of society who will agree to a marriage of convenience.  Her choice is the notorious rake Viscount Sebastian St. Vincent, but first she must talk to him before she can offer him a proposal he cannot refuse.<br /><br />Evie enters the lion's lair sans a chaperone.  Sebastian is impressed with her courage and her offer is most generous except for her stipulation of no sex after their wedding night.  He plans to wed the chit, seduce her with his lovemaking skills, and when has his full, he will go elsewhere for his needs.  So why does he find going elsewhere suddenly an abomination especially since the beauty rejects his advances by hiding her love for her spouse out of fear he will break her heart.<br /><br />The latest seasonal Wallflower tale (see SECRETS OF A SUMMER NIGHT and IT HAPPENED ONE AUTUMN) is a terrific early Victorian romance.  Evie unlike her more vivacious Wallflowers is the last person one would expect to dare to approach Sebastian, but that she does encouraged by her teammates.  Sebastian is enthralled by her courage as much as by her beauty as he realizes how difficult the task to approach him must have been.  Similar to the previous two historicals, no one will care as Lisa Kleypas' fans will wonder if spring can be far behind.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay has reached new levels in this album. Even with an excellent start on their first album, Parachutes, they keep getting better. They are still making the same mellow songs with deeper meanings behind the lyrics, but in this album they have evolved into more. The first track, Square One, is the perfect way to start the album with an upbeat pace and a new electronic sound. One of my favorites is Swallowed in the Sea about losing someone close, that goes back to Coldplays slow melodic style to focus on the lyrics. I just recently saw them live on the Twisted Logic tour and I have to say that being my favorite band of all time, they have yet to let me down, this album being no acception. I love it the more I listen to it. Some other excellent songs on this album are: Talk, Fix You, Twisted Logic, and Kingdom Come (originally written for Johnny Cash).

B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I cannot believe anyone rated this movie with more than 2 stars.  I also can't believe that anyone other than a marketer of the film would say that it is \\"easily on a par\\" with the BBC version. <br /> <br />This version is thin and shallow.  No character gets developed.  Many that are present are protrayed incorrectly.  Mr. Bennet seems to actually respect his wife.  That alone is unbelievable.  Then the writers can't seem to decide how to play the dialogue.  Characters alternately use a more natural style of english and then suddenly lurch back into the more formal language of the book.  They would have done my ears a service by choosing one way or the other. <br /> <br />And some of the artistic license is amazing.  That Lady Catherine would travel 50 miles in the middle of the night to confront Elizabeth in front of her entire family.  Or Mr. Darcy delivering his explanatory letter to Elizabeth also at night by appearing almost as an apparition in her room. <br /> <br />There are more items I could mention but to get to the point, I thought this version was laughable.  Anyone who does not know Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice and watches this, has not seen Pride and Prejudice.  They will have hardly even seen an imitation of the story.  Do yourself a favor.  Read the book and stay away from this movie.
0375751513|4.0|Fistly, I would like to tell you why I'm interested to read this book? I have many reasons to read this book such as my friend is the big fan of Oscar Wilde's stories and she told me that it's a great book, another reason that really made me want to read this book is after I saw the movie called the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, in this movie all charaters are from very well-known book or we can say that they are classic characters. For example Dracula or Vampire, invinsible man(skinner), Dr.Jackle and Mr.Hike, etc.Only one character that I don't know is Dorian Gray(forever young guy), so I find the book to read.<br /><br />When I bought this book, at first I think it would be boring book because it's quite a all style.....but after I read a couple chapters from this book, I change my mind. It's fun, in teresting ideas and use a easy language or I can say that Oscar Wilde use a simple word but feel brilliant and amazing.Another good point for this book is explain the character and place very clear that you can imagine follow the story.<br /><br />I can't say that it's a bad point but it's quite difficult to understand some qoutes but if you read twice or more and think about fact or in a present time you'll understand or may think it's a great qoute.<br /><br />For other thing that I received from this book is social life in the past(around Victorian period), especially for the upper and middle-class people.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is the best chick flick EVER!!  I took my 9 year old daughter with me to see it.  She loves it.  Of course, she loves the BBC version as well.  I highly recommend this film if you love Austen and Keira Knightly (who sooooo deserves the oscar for her role!)  My favorite scene is the one when Elizabeth first sees Pemberly for the first time.  Keira's expression was AWESOME!!  Check this film out, it is a must see!
B00004YYDI|5.0|True classic movie. A must own for movie collectors. Amazing movie.
B0000A118M|5.0|It had been some time since I listened to this album but, it dawned on me when I did recently that this might be the best album to represent the changes in America in the 1960s. A lot of groups are credited with writing music that captured the tension of the time, particularly that found in the civil rights struggle.<br /><br />Coltrane, already a very popular tradition jazz player, put out an album in 1964 that challenged most everything musically while capturing a spiritual side of jazz that would influence others to come.
0739321617|5.0|It is indepth, refreshing and a good read. You also have the chance to go online and see how true the book is. After reading the book I was made aware of Gogle Desktop and all the other offerings from Google. <br />A great success story about 2 guys who stood for what they believed.
0061020680|5.0|As one of the funniest books in the series, I would give this one eleven or twelve stars...easily!  Death is always a fun character with Pratchett giving him droll humor and insights and to see him interacting with his own cast of characters is a stitch!
B00005A46T|1.0|I listened to this album and was very unimpressed. To compare it to the more (real) hardcore bands like Morbid Angel, and Hypocrisy is a waste of time. Its not hardcore music, stop thinking it is, if ten year olds listen to it(...)(seriously TEN YEAR OLDS)then it is just mainstream garbage. And to compare them to any classic act like Led Zeppelin, and CCR is just an insult.
B000AMUU94|5.0|Up until the 3 disc Platinum Collection, there hasn't really been a great overview of Bowie's prime years (1969-1987). Previous collections such as \\"Best of Bowie\\" and \\"Singles Collection\\" were only 2 discs and there seemed to be too many great songs missing. Even at 3 discs, some of my personal favorite tracks such as \\"Moonage Daydream\\" and \\"Watch That Man\\" are missing. But when you look at the track list on this Platinum Collection, it's hard to think of a better Bowie collection than this. All of the  essential classics, radio hits, and even great album tracks are here. There are even a few surprises like \\"Sorrow\\" and \\"Underground\\" which are often overlooked on Bowie compilations. Most of the tracks on disc 3 and some on disc 2 are single versions, but these are probably the same versions that you hear on the radio and are necessary in order to fit all of the tracks onto one disc. From \\"Space Oddity\\" to \\"Let's Dance,\\" this is some of the best music of the last quarter century and David Bowie remains one of the greatest influences in the industry. To hear why, this is the one Bowie collection to get. Highly recommended.
B0000524CY|5.0|The all-time classic tale of demonic possession, based on William Peter Blatty's bestselling novel. Linda Blair is Regan MacNeil, a twelve-year-old girl who becomes manifested by a truly malevolent spirit. Her mother, Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn), an agnostic, seeks out help from a young Jesuit psychiatrist, Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller, God rest his Irish soul!)who has demons of his own, and is tormented by the recent death of his mother, and his loss in the faith that he sought refuge in. After confronting the demon within the girl (and himself), Karras, although skeptical of demonic possession, is given permission by the church to assist during the exorcism. The priest selected to perform the ritual is a mysterious, elderly Jesuit, Father Lankaster Merrin (Max Von Sydow) who has seen such devilish work before. As the two clergymen face off against the demon, a police detective, Lt. William F. Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb) finds some links connecting the girl with a puzzling death and desecration in the local Catholic church.<br /><br />William Friedkin brilliantly directed, and Blatty adapted the screenplay (receiving an Oscar for his efforts) and produced. The cast gives extraordinary, sensitive performances (Burstyn, Miller and Blair were all nominated for Academy Awards) and the special effects are breathtaking and still pack a punch, with veteran actress Mercedes McCambridge providing the voice of the evil entity. (The film also won for Best Achievement In Sound). The underlying theme of much of Blatty's work is evident, his philosophy being, if there's all this evil out there, why is there so much good? Metaphorically, everyone fights there own demons, and even in his last self-sacrificing moment, Karras finds his faith again and heroically gives his life to save this innocent child. How more meaningful can it be? A truly terrifying, engrossing and ultimately touching film dealing with faith and human frailty.
0060899190|5.0|Moving, funny, great for just picking up whenever and glancing through. You'll feel inspired, touched, and longing when you read it. It makes each person feel less alone reading the inner most fears, pet peeves, and desires of strangers. Wonderful original art. Check it out for yourself!
B00009UW0N|5.0|I think the fact that this movie has so many pages of user comments speaks volumes of the film's impact, which resonates today. It doesn't matter how many times you've seen it, it loses none of its power to make you scream, and keep you on the edge of your seat. While made on a relatively low budget, it really enhances the creepy quality of the production.<br /><br />The story of a small town rocked by a young boy's crime of murdering his teenage sister, his subsequent placement in a psychiatric institution, and his escape fifteen years later, on Halloween, the anniversary of his crime. Only his psychiatrist, Dr. Sam Loomis (the late Donald Pleasance) realizes how dangerous he is, and where he's headed, back to good old Haddonfield, Illinois.<br /><br />Jamie Lee Curtis, as the teenage Laurie Strode, seemingly always dateless compared to her more sexually aggressive friends, Annie Brackett (Nancy Loomis), the daughter of the local sheriff, and Lynda (P.J. Soles), is prototype of the strong, good girl heroines that would later dominate the horror film genre. She ends up doing her usual babysitting, unaware that the psychotic killer is lurking in the neighborhood, voyeuristically peeking at her and her friends. He stalks the girls one by one, with Laurie as his last target.<br /><br />The musical score adds to the atmosphere considerably, subtly creepy, as the infamous Michael Myers closes in on his prey. The fact that it is a small, isolated community with an ill-equipped police force only increases the viewer's dread, as the effect is almost claustrophobic.<br /><br />And I loved hearing the classic 70s song, \\"Don't Fear The Reaper\\" by Blue Oyster Cult as Annie and Laurie head off to their babysitting jobs.<br /><br />Everything about this film is excellent: the acting, direction, sets, music, choreography, costumes, hairstyles, architecture, dialogue, pace . . . . .<br /><br />And it's nowhere near as violent and bloody as its reputation. Bar the windows, lock the doors, turn off the lights, and keep someone to cuddle with nearby - you'll need that!!!!dows, lock the doors, turn off the lights, and keep someone to cuddle with nearby - you'll need that!!!! <br />  <br />
B000E6EJAC|4.0|Mott the Hoople were the most influential and most under-rated band in the history of rock. All the Young Dudes was their rise from the ashes. The story is well-told. Now at last Sony has remastered their Columbia albums with bonus tracks. The bonus tracks are new to the US, but have been available in the UK in various forms.<br /><br />\\"Side one\\" of the original LP was a tour-de-force of the sexual gestalt of the early 70s in general and the \\"glam\\" movement in particular. All the Young Dudes was adopted by the gay community as their anthem. Sucker begins with \\"Hi there, you're friendly neighborhood sadist come to take you for a ride.\\" Momma's Little Jewel is \\"fresh from the nuns who made you.\\" Jerkin' Crocus claims \\"I know what you want, just a lick from an ice cream cone.\\"<br /><br />The rest of the CD is just plain brilliant Mott the Hoople. One of the Boys is All the Young Dudes without the sex. Mick Ralphs sings Ready for Love - a song he will eventually re-record with his new band, Bad Company. And no Mott record is complete without a ballad from Ian Hunter, and Sea Diver is one of his best.<br /><br />There are flaws with the record. Bowie severly clipped the drum sound on the original, and it's fixed as best can be on this remaster. The \\"phone\\" trick in One of the Boys is annoying, which makes the single edit included in the bonus tracks a real treat. Verden Allen sings a self-penned number that is not atypical Mott, but Allen's organ was so key to the band's original sound he deserves a spotlight track. Listen closely to the coda to One of the Boys and spot his brilliance. This would be his last record with Mott, and he made the best of it.<br /><br />I have to comment on the liner notes. An excellent essay is included, and its written by a true fan - meaning that it's accurate and informative. However, the notation for the bonus tracks is lacking. Comparing the two recent remasters (the Mott album was remastered and released at the same time), there are inconsistencies. The two live tracks included here are a later version of the band - only three of the five band members on All the Young Dudes are present, and Ariel Bender, Ralph's replacement on lead guitar, is not credited. The live cuts are from Sony's UK-only expanded edition of the Live album. That is noted on the live cuts on Mott, but not mentioned here. Minor details.<br /><br />All the Young Dudes is an excellent snapshot of the early 70s, but amazingly enough, the best of Mott was yet to come!e are inconsistencies.

B0008ISM40|3.0|Well, the album certainly wasn't Downward Spiral or the fragile, it was a more positive feel, and while the album wasn't a total loss, it was a complete leap into the unknown , I welcomed the changes, but it seems to only have washed out what could have been a really compelling album. <br /> <br />Good players, good singing, I guess the direction of the album could have been worked on. The CD well, a tad inconvinient with the whole turning it over to get DVD functionality. <br /> <br />
B000BEZQ18|5.0|Willie Nelson's \\"He Was a Friend of Mine\\": not sure if this was written especially for the movie but it sure is a fitting one if it wasn't.

0137549202|5.0|This is the outstanding 2nd edition of Oppenheim's classic DSP book, which for over two decades was the only real choice for a textbook on the subject. That was too bad, since the first edition was probably the worst thing I have ever seen in print - terse, incomprehensible, and with only a few awful and poorly illustrated examples. When I decided to take a refresher course in DSP, I was horrified to see our class would be using the second edition of that horrendous text. What I found instead was a completely rehabilitated textbook! This is not a beginner's DSP textbook by any stretch of the imagination, but absolutely everything is explained and there are plenty of well worked out examples. The end-of-chapter problems are broken down into simple, intermediate, and advanced problems with quite a few mind-puzzlers in the advanced section. Plus, the answers to the first 20 problems in every chapter are in the back of the book.<br />There is really nothing unique about the book's format. What does makes the book unique is the density and amount of material included. Just about every page is packed with well-explained important information. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has had a prior semester of an upper-level undergraduate class in Signals and Systems and wants to study DSP. An accompanying book that you might find helpful is \\"Understanding Digital Signal Processing\\" by Lyons. That book is good for getting an intuitive feel for DSP.

0316666343|3.0|This novel was riveting.  I read it in one day- could not put it down!  The entire premise of building the story around a murdered girl's view as she watches those left behind on earth is wonderful.  However, as many have already stated, there is one event that occurs about 3/4 of the way in that almost crushed all the enjoyment the novel had thus far brought me.  For a moment I was jolted back into the real world as the novel fell into unbelieveable shreds and my mind was realing with- nooooooo!  Why did the author put this in, it is absolutely ridiculous and doesn't fit with the rest of the book.  It would fit on some stupid talk show with that psychic Sylvia Brown or whatever her name is, but it almost ruined the book in my opinion.  I still gave it 3 stars because everything else was so good.
6303402348|2.0|This film is a parody on American culture. Think of it as a comic book with actors instead of cartoon character. Does it remind you of Voltaire's \\"Candide\\"? It starts by telling you it is who your Mom knows that is important, not what you know. We see how a mentally handicapped boy can get a college education through physical superiority (running). What else matters? Sending Forrest into the Army provides another way to reference the events of the 1960s. Jenny tells Forrest to \\"run away\\" from troubles; he does take her advice even if she doesn't. Forrest arrives in Vietnam, and rescues many of the wounded. After being wounded, Forrest recuperates and learns to be a ping-pong expert.  <br /> <br />Forrest gets the Medal of Honor and moons LBJ! [Some sort of comic touch?] The scenes of anti-war protest were re-created with some historical scenes. Next we wee Forrest as part of Nixon's historic flip-flop in recognizing Red China. Another amusing spot is putting Forrest on the Dick Cavett show with John Lennon. Forrest celebrates New Year with Lt. Dan, but things go awry. In another joke Forrest is at the Watergate Hotel when he reports men with flashlights in a dark room! So Forrest buys a shrimp boat and does well. His money is invested in an apple company and he becomes so rich he can work for free! Jenny returns and finds her old house an abandoned derelict. [Does this foretell her future?] Forrest's cross-country run parodies the jogging craze and the bumper-sticker mentality. Reporters ask whats its all about? People follow him like the lemmings of fiction. Then its over. <br /> <br />Forrest gets a letter from Jenny, visits her and finds a little Forrest, the smartest boy in his class [mocking the \\"science\\" of eugenics?]. And then they marry, but don't live happily ever after. {A subtle joke?] The ending show little Forrest getting on a school bus, and Forrest sits and waits. This film is too comic for a drama, and not all that funny. <br /> <br />
B000AXSN5G|1.0|Profound Lyrics have catapulted Neil Young into the upper-echelon of the classic singer-songwriters.  Here, Praire Wind consists of lyrics a 10-year old would write for a school project.  Nothing like Neil Young is capable of, and despite the hype that this album has, eventually Praire Wind will settle as one of his worst efforts.   <br /> <br />Why the album has such hype I can't say.  But my guess is that at first blush many of Neil's songs sound the same.  And it isn't till multiple listens that the wheat is separated from the chaffe.  So, even though Prairie Wind may sound like a classic at first to reviewers, it isn't.
B00001OH1S|4.0|I bought this soundtrack for one specific track - Sting's Windmills Of Your Mind. Most of the other tracks were a very nice bonus, especially Nina Simone's Sinnerman. Much longer than in the movie, and worth it. This soundtrack delivers, unlike others I've purchased who didn't include the tracks that were in the movie (The Score = thumbs down).
B00000634J|3.0|It seemed those days would never end. John Lennon was the most idiosyncratic and perhaps the most musically and culturally interesting Beatle, but his solo work quickly showed how much the Beatles were greater than the sum of their parts. His serious creative decline is masked on this expertly chosen collection by presenting the tracks in non-chronological order, but I notice that although he died in 1980, 10 of the 20 tracks here were made between 1969 and 1971. They include the great early singles with the Plastic Ono Band - Give Peace A Chance, Cold Turkey, Instant Karma - but unfortunately without the B-sides that featured Yoko Ono and the Plastic Ono Band, with John Lennon on guitar, and which are mostly unavailable on CD. Move Over Ms L, the uptempo non-album flipside of Stand By Me, is also missed.<br />Nobody Told Me, a powerful recording from 1980, released posthumously as a single in 1984, reminds us that he lived through the punk era, outliving Marc Bolan, and indicates that he might have been starting to buck the trend of his baking bread years.<br />To answer a previous reviewer, the drummer on the Plastic Ono Band's 1970 album was Ringo, and what a great job he does, too.
6305511055|4.0|Though this movie was set some time ago, it is very pertinent to what is happening today.  Unlike many of the special effects that are off the chart today, the down to earth physical attributes of the actors come across as if it could happen to any of us. I've always enjoyed Robert Redford's movies, it is a great opportunity to see what made him a great actor.
B00005JOQ9|1.0|ok, so, i am utterly sick and tired of hearing about BR00T4L and GRU3SUM this movie is.    have i seen it? you bet your [back] i haven't.  why not? a personal hatred for Eli Roth, and a surly attitude of disliking towards Tarantino.    basically, what Roth did here, was take the (brilliant) torture scene from Audition and turn it into an hour and a half of \\"let's try to shock the same people who went to see Lord of the Rings 600 times.\\"    because let's face it, this is a mainstream horror film, and it can't POSSIBLY be nearly as bad as, say, Salo.    Cabin Fever was, without a doubt, one of the WORST horror films i've ever seen, and just generally one of the worst films of all time, so it's only natural that this one eats a big one.    Roth can kiss Takashi Miike's sphincter as much as he wants, but it will NEVER get me to pay any amount of money to see one of his films.  and now he's doing a film with Tarantino and Robert Rodrigues which, OH HOW IRONIC, is two horror films and in the middle fake horror trailers (now, who would ever think that Tarantino would go and rip off an Asian film? [Three...Extremes}    so, to conclude this rant, i'd like to take the time to say:    if you think this film is awesome, great, violent, cool, good or even mediocre, do me a sweet favor and stop wasting my air.    i'd recommend some films that actually ARE sick, depraved and disturbing, but if you liked this film, i don't want you anywhere NEAR the stuff i like.
B000E97X66|5.0|Well, is it? There are other contenders always mentioned (eg James Brown Live At The Apollo) but for me this has to be it. No other artist gives me that lump in the throat meeting full adrenalin rush. I was there at the show. It was a night that changed my life and made me look at music and performance in a totally different way. I seem to remember Bruce and the band being introduced but this was edited out of the dvd and cd. It would have been nice to have it included but it's not really important. What is important is the music. I was in such a daze after the show. I remember thinking that I wish he'd played Saint In The City. Well of course he did as you can hear on this magnicent cd. The energy and passion just leaps up at you. Put this into perspective. Bruce as has been noted by another reviewer was not a superstar then. Who else was doing stuff like this then? Nobody. Who performed like this? Nobody. And 30 years later who is still out there and performing better than anyone? You know it. Play this loud and you can imagine you were there.  <br />This is the greatest live album of all time!

B000E1ZBH2|5.0|In this latest version of Pride and Prejudice, Director Joe Wright uses impressive visuals and sumptuous period locales to create an exquisite wide-screen spectacle, filling it with details that illustrate important sociological information about its central family, the Bennets. From the movie's mist-filled and dream-like opening moments to its marvelous ball sequence and the predictable but nonetheless glorious ending, Pride & Prejudice is an absolutely sumptuous evocation of Jane Austen's milieu, and is a captivatingly youthful spin without compromising the novel's late-eighteenth-century manners; it also deserves to be remembered as one of the very best screen adaptations of this book so far.  <br /> <br />Mrs. Bennet (Brenda Blethyn) is fraught with worry. The mother of five daughters has proved to be a little bit much for her and if they don't start marrying soon, the family will be ruined. The father (Donald Sutherland) stays out of the way, hoping his daughters somehow overcome societal prejudice against their gender and make something of their minds.  Headstrong Elizabeth (Kira Knightley) has done just that. Smart, feisty, and fiercely independent, Lizzie promises herself that she won't be one to settle.  <br /> <br />When Lizzie's older sister, Jane (Rosamund Pike), meets the wealthy Mr. Bingley (Simon Woods) at a dance, their future as a couple seems predetermined. But when Lizzie is introduced to the gloomy and standoffish Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen), an instant dislike is established. Lizzie and Mr. Darcy must overcome quite a few obstacles before they can transcend their dislike of each other, not the least of which is unsuitable suitor Mr. Collins (a wonderfully comic Tom Hollander) and Darcy's formidable aunt Lady Catherine (Dame Judi Dench) who tells Lizzie that she is of an \\"inferior class.\\" Of course, Lizzie's frosty rejection of Darcy eventually thaws when he confesses his passion for her one evening on a misty moor.  <br /> <br />Pride and Prejudice really works because of the marvelously impassioned performances from its two sexy leads. As the strong-willed Elizabeth, Knightley is tantalizing and seductive, so perfectly fitting into her 19th century Austen surroundings; she catches Elizabeth's essential skittishness and youthful braggadocio, making her final conversion with Darcy all the more moving. Macfadyen as Darcy is a more conflicted, softer figure than Colin Firth's indelibly etched performance, but Macfadyen is much earthier and sexier, and his portrayal is one that fits the movie's more realistic mood.  <br /> <br />Pride and Prejudice benefits from Wright's intensely visual approach that manages to meld realism with romance in a canny balance. The movie has a youthful essence, as well as providing a richly detailed setting. Scenes barely sketched in Austen's dialogue-heavy, description-light prose leap fully detailed onto the screen, thanks to Sarah Greenwood's terrific production design and Jacqueline Durran's textured costumes. This is a unique, gorgeously evocative, and quite accomplished film, which should satisfy even the most rabid Austen-ophiles - just lovely. Mike Leonard March 06.  <br />

B000E1155E|4.0|It's hard to believe in the three short years since the Arctic Monkeys picked up their respective instruments they've conquered the U.K. Will they storm our shores or fizzle like a fourth of July sparkler (Stone Roses, Blur). The lads have an abundance of youthful wit and swagger. Unfortunately they must face the burden of unrealistic expectations. If the listener gives the disc a chance (three spins) A.M.'s strengths will be revealed. These strengths include: scowling/vibrant vocals/lyrics (rock stars practicing their lines in the toliet), fat punk riffs and melodies which cover the British landscape from The Beatles to the late great Libertines. All these elements come together in the brilliant \\"when the sun goes down\\". There are at least a half dozen gems in this collection. Britpop is not dead. It just took a group of brawling pool hustling youngsters to crack it in the head!

B000E8QVWY|4.0|.....and be surprised at how close to the originals Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon actually sound when they sing in this terrific biopic. This film is a wonderfull veichle for both actors as it shows the audience a side of them few would have thought they were capable of. <br /> <br />Obviously a career as storied as that of the Man in Black...Mr. Johnny Cash....is difficult to cover completely in two hours however director Jame's Mangold manages to cover most bases including Johnny's infamous visit to Folsom prison, his battles with drugs and booze and of course his great romance with June Carter Cash. <br /> <br />Also included are some fun cameo roles by Cash contempories Elvis Presly and Jerry Lee Lewis which certainly enhance rather than detract from the story of the movie. <br /> <br />Perhaps most the outstanding aspect of the film is the ability of Phoenix to interpret and mimic the mannerisms and attitude of Johnny and much like Jamie Foxx's efforts in the comparable \\"Ray\\" he should be bequeathed with the golden statue by the good people of the Academy. Of course the drawback to these hopes is the career making performance offered up by Philip Seymour Hoffman as Truman Capote which stands as his main competitor for the Oscar. <br />
0670034711|4.0|Having just finished Alain de Botton's erudite \\"The Art of Travel\\", I found myself lured to journalist and author Elizabeth Gilbert's highly personal year of traveling abroad. Hers is a journal of begrudging self-discovery, earthier and less instantly revelatory but far more amusing than the high-minded guidance de Botton provides in his book. Full of shrewd observations and hilarious anecdotes, Gilbert organizes her eminently readable book into three discrete sections (one for each geographic destination - Rome, India and Bali) with each section containing thirty-six stories. Altogether, there are 108 chapters - a meaningful number since `108' is a three-digit multiple of three, a spiritual number, and it also equals the number of prayer beads on a Buddhist meditative \\"japa mala\\".<br /><br />The book's title is not so much a riff on Ang Lee's \\"Eat Drink Man Woman\\" as it is a cryptic description of a meditation on love in its many forms, whether it revolves around food, language, other people, God and quite inevitably, herself. However, this is not an exercise in vainglorious self-aggrandizement but rather a thoughtful probing of how she came to choose her exotic destinations. Fresh into decompression mode, she travels to Rome to learn Italian simply because of the sensuality of the language. Gilbert loves the sound, the feel of it in her mouth and more pervasively, the sensual side of her it brings out.<br /><br />She also becomes quite the gourmand, eating in a variety of trattorias, pizzerias and gelaterias with abandon and gaining twenty-three pounds along the way. Gilbert also makes some great friends, which becomes one of her greatest sources of strengths for her throughout the book, and even more importantly, she learns to treat herself well and respect her boundaries. After a lifetime of American workaholism, the author discovers the principle of \\"bel far niente\\", i.e., the beauty of doing nothing. This freedom transforms her from frazzled and anxious to relaxed and sensual but not in a romanticized way. Realizing that she needs to work on her boundary issues, she maintains a vow of celibacy and determines to sacrifice the pleasure of sex with Italian men.<br /><br />With this new-found liberation, Gilbert then spends an intense several months at an ashram in India, meeting more great people but in this case, those seeking out their spiritual side. Meditation and yoga become her priorities, and in turn, she discovers and addresses her control issues. With a palpable moderation in her boundary and control issues, Gilbert ultimately looks for balance in Bali, the third leg of her global journey, as she hopes to cement all she has learned in the previous eight months. She becomes the disciple of a medicine man, befriends a single mother and falls in love with Felipe, a too-good-to-be-true Brazilian jewelry importer.<br /><br />Although it is cathartic to see Gilbert so fully aware of herself at this point of her travels, the escalating drive of the book weakens somewhat in this section since her more discernible talent is in conveying the angst-ridden human condition. For instance, even while she is denying herself the sensual pleasures she finds in Rome, Gilbert writes descriptively about how the people around her nourished her soul. This witty sense of contrast with her surroundings is missing in her remembrances of Bali. Regardless, the book is a fine inward journey of a woman who felt a need to fly to faraway places to discover her inner self. I believe de Botton would approve of the author's inordinately zestful approach to her introspective hopscotch travels.relaxed and sensual but not in a romanticized way. Realizing that she needs to work on her boundary issues, she maintains a vow of celibacy and determines to sacrifice the pleasure of sex with Italian men. <br /> <br />With this new-found liberation, Gilbert then spends an intense several months at an ashram in India, meeting more great people but in this case, those seeking out their spiritual side. Meditation and yoga become her priorities, and in turn, she discovers and addresses her control issues. With a palpable moderation in her boundary and control issues, Gilbert ultimately looks for balance in Bali, the third leg of her global journey, as she hopes to cement all she has learned in the previous eight months. She becomes the disciple of a medicine man, befriends a single mother and falls in love with Felipe, a too-good-to-be-true Brazilian jewelry importer. <br /> <br />Although it is cathartic to see Gilbert so fully aware of herself at this point of her travels, the escalating drive of the book weakens somewhat in this section since her more discernible talent is in conveying the angst-ridden human condition. For instance, even while she is denying herself the sensual pleasures she finds in Rome, Gilbert writes descriptively about how the people around her nourished her soul. This witty sense of contrast with her surroundings is missing in her remembrances of Bali. Regardless, the book is a fine inward journey of a woman who felt a need to fly to faraway places to discover her inner self. I believe de Botton would approve of the author's inordinately zestful approach to her introspective hopscotch travels.
B00005QB42|5.0|For years now I have encouraged people to use play lists to provide a soundtrack for work, recreation and contemplation. If done properly, they can quickly put your mind and subtle systems into perfect alignment to carry out whatever you want or need to do. Constructing play lists has become so much easier with the advent of the iPod. One of the fun things about iTunes is being able to see how many times you have played a particular song.<br /><br />I was a little surprised to see that I had played the crown jewel of this collection - the Gayatri Manta - well over a hundred times over the last five years or so. Deva Premal's interpretation of this famous piece is extraordinarily fine, as is the entire album. It is almost impossible not to be uplifted by her amazing voice, which is rich, resonant and deepened by the most extraordinary sub-harmonics. Indeed if you are not, it may be a helpful pointer that something is not going quite right in your body or in your life, and that it's time to get some guidance about how to help yourself.<br /><br />So much more than music, this is sound therapy.

0425179877|3.0|...I am afraid this book misses the mark.  Kranz <br />is defintely one of the great heroes of the glory <br />days of the American space program and one of those <br />who \\"wrote the book\\", along with Chris Kraft <br />and John Hodge (the original \\"Red, White and Blue <br />Team flight directors!) defining the mission of  <br />the flight controllers and directors. Unfortunately, <br />this book does not really give the reader a good idea <br />of what it is that the controllers and flight director <br />do.  If it did, the reader would be in even greater <br />awe of these men who had intelligence, nerves of steel, <br />and the ability to make life-or-death decisions within <br />a split second. <br />In order to learn what is really involved in these <br />jobs, I strongly recommend the book \\"Apollo: The <br />Race to the Moon\\" by Murray and Bly-Cox. They give <br />a good description of what went on in the MOCR <br />(Mission Operations Control Room) and the various <br />jobs of the different controllers and the flight <br />director himself, and what qualities these men <br />had to have.  Kranz unfortunately does not include <br />this in his book, probably feeling that the general <br />reader would not find it interesting, but this is <br />the kernel of what it was that made him the outstanding <br />personality that he is. He should have taken a typical <br />mission and given a sequential description of the things <br />he had to do and the decisions he had to make. <br />Having said this, the book is still worth reading, even <br />for someone who has considerable knowledge of the history <br />of the space program.  What is particularly interesting <br />is his description of the major disagreement that occurred <br />on the Gemini 9 mission (flown by Stafford and Cernan) when <br />it was suggested to carry out an emergeny EVA (spacewalk) <br />in order to try to open the shroud that failed to open <br />on the Agena target vehicle which prevented docking. <br />Kranz vehemently opposed doing this, thinking that it was <br />too dangerous and being only the second EVA, they didn't <br />have enough experience.  When senior management decided <br />to go ahead with it anyway, Kranz muttered to his boss, <br />Chris Kraft that he had enough and this would be his <br />last mission, if they weren't going to listen to him. <br />In the end, the EVA was cancelled and Kranz withdrew <br />his threat to quit.  In Kraft's book, he blandly mentions <br />that it was decided NOT to carry out the EVA. Apparently, <br />Kraft (who does also mention some mild criticisim of Kranz <br />in his book) didn't want to remind people that he had <br />been on the wrong side of a potentially bad decision.
B000002KE2|5.0|Black Sabbath toured a great deal in support of their third album, \\"Masters of Reality,\\" which lead to bad health for the band members. But Ozzy and the gang aren't a band to go quietly; they managed to weather the storm, and record and release their fourth album in 1972.<br /><br />\\"Vol. 4\\" is Sabbath's last record before the band started incorporating keyboards and orchestras into their music, so some fans think this is the last true Sabbath album. I wouldn't go as far to say that, but I do think that there is no doubt that this is the group's last album before they got experimental.<br /><br />Every band member is in fine form, here. Tony turns out groovey riffs, Bill thumps away at his drum set, and Ozzy wails the vocals. (The wailing guitar solo on \\"Wheels of Confusion,\\" and the long drum solo on \\"Supernaut\\" are two examples of the band's excellent musicianship.)<br /><br />Like all timeless albums, there are a few truly great songs on here (like the superb \\"Supernaut,\\" the controversial/infamous \\"Snowblind,\\" and the very doom-y album closer, \\"Under The Sun\\"). But the rest of the album is pretty darn great, too. \\"Wheels of Confusion\\" is an epic, eight minute album opener, and \\"Tomorrow's Dream\\" and \\"St. Vitus' Dance\\" are backed by a deep, dark groove and sludgy, grumbling riffs. Three other lost classics are the weepy, obligatory ballad, \\"Changes,\\" where Ozzy sings and mopes over a gentle piano, \\"Cornucopia\\" (which is one of Sabbath's fastest and heaviest songs), and the beautiful acoustic instrumental, \\"Laguna Sunrise.\\"<br /><br />So, \\"Vol. 4\\" shows all the right signs of being a great metal masterpiece. And, since it was released over 30 years ago, I think it's safe to say that it has definitely withstood the test of time. It may not be as influential as Black Sabbath's first three discs, but it's still a great album, and it proudly stands on the shelf next to any other metal classic.

B000E1ZBGS|3.0|I saw this during the holiday season because I was curious to see if it could outdo the 1995 BBC version. IMO it does not because one of the key players is sorely miscast. While Keira Knightly is luminous as Elizabeth Bennett I thought Matthew McFayden's \\"Mr. Darcy\\" was dull and and more melancholy looking than arrogant/proud. The actress who portrayed Jane appeared much older than she actually is in real life. Poor Dame Judi Dench who I love in so many other films does not have the features to pull off an aristocratic member of the peerage. She resembled a pillow that had been adorned with finery but to no avail...still unbecoming. The rest of the cast and the beautiful English countryside made it a tolerable film, however, I would much prefer to own the BBC version.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|Some will ask \\"how many versions of Jane Austen's read-to-the-point-of-fraying 'Pride and Prejudice' do we need?\\"  The current film archives show no fewer than ten versions and growing.  But for this viewer the current P & P du jour is as satisfying as any, edited and distilled to its main story lines without diminishing the main message from the author. Deborah Moggach can be thanked for the screenplay (with some subtle revisions by Emma Thompson) and Joe Wright  for his sensitive and forward momentum directing approach.<br /><br />So what make this version different and successful?  First, the placement of the Bennet family in the pig and mud friendly country home that sets the scene properly for the driver of the film - finding proper husbands for the five daughters whose well placed marriages will assure the lower class Bennet family a future stability.  Yes, it is a bit untidy, this household, but that makes it a family more dependent on the land and more prone to dreams of 'marrying up' in a country ruled by class system. Second, the casting of the Bennnet family with five truly young actresses (Keira Knightly, Rosamund Pike, Talulah Riley, Jena Malone, Carey Mulligan) instead of older types trying to appear like teenagers; a mother (Brenda Blethyn) who indeed shows her desperation of class; and a father (Donald Sutherland) who epitomizes Austen's father figure mold.  Add to the Bennets the credible men characters of Simon Woods, Matthew Macfadyen, Tom Hollander, and  Cornelius Booth and top it all off with a pivotal Lady Catherine de Bourg of Judi Dench and all players are in place for a fine cast.  The dialogue is crisp and sharp and the usual diversions into lineage names and sidebars are eliminated, bringing this long story down to just over two hours.<br /><br />The scenery and costumes are superb as is the cinematography by Roman Oshin and the musical score by Dario Marianelli  with a lot of help from Henry Purcell.  Is it one of the best movies of the year?  Perhaps, perhaps not, depending on taste. But it is nice to see Keira Knightly shine in a role more challenging than any she has had to date.  She inhabits Elizabeth Bennet luminously.  Grady Harp, March 06he year?  Perhaps, perhaps not, depending on taste.

0316172324|4.0|On the surface Malcolm Gladwell's Blink is not explicitly about leadership-educational or otherwise-but upon further examination, the application of Gladwell's work can be invaluable to anyone in need of making an important decision. <br /> <br /> The bulk of Blink is an exploration of how the mind works during the decision making process.  Gladwell posits that one of the greatest mistakes that humans make when making decisions is that they fail recognize the significance of their unconscious mind.  It is a commonly held belief that a \\"good\\" decision is one that comes out of a long and thorough decision making process made by the conscious mind.  Gladwell openly challenges this conventional wisdom with the three major principles he sets out to prove in Blink.   <br /> <br /> The first is to convince the reader that \\"decisions made very quickly can be every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately.\\"  This principle is explored at length through the discussion rapid cognition which is also known as the theory of \\"thin slicing.\\"  Thin slicing is \\"the ability of our unconscious mind to find patterns in situations and behavior based on very narrow slices of experience.\\"  The second principle is that while in many cases it is recommended to trust one's instincts, these same instincts have the ability to betray us.  In other words, when making rapid decisions, human beings cannot ignore the fact that certain aspects of physical appearance-a person's size, color, or sex-can trigger some very powerful associations which have the potential to lead to prejudice and discrimination.  The third and perhaps most interesting concept explored in the book is the idea that decisions and reactions made by the unconscious mind can be influenced and controlled by our conscious mind.  In other words, the conscious mind can be \\"primed\\" though suggestive words and images to affect the unconscious decision.  This concept is one that is continually relied upon by advertisersand spin doctors to sway the public to subscribe to whatever \\"product\\" is being peddled. <br /> <br /> Gladwell explores these intriguing concepts using scientific research and anecdotal evidence from a wide and diverse series culturally relevant subjects including:  speed dating in Manhattan, the presidential campaign of Warren G. Harding, the potentially embarrassing war games that preceded the current war in Iraq, the musical career of the up and coming artist Kenna, the famous early 1980's \\"Pepsi Challenge,\\" diagnosing heart attacks at Cook County hospital, and the tragic shooting of Amadou Diallo by four New York police officers in 1999.  Gladwell's previous experience as a writer for The New Yorker serves him well here because whether he is discussing the various muscles that are used to make a specific facial expression or the rules of comedic improvisation, he writes at a level and tone that is inherently readable.  A lesser writer would not be able to bring all of these disparate examples together without sounding merely coincidental.  Gladwell succeeds because at the outset of the chapter he establishes the fundamental concept that he wants to prove and then goes about the business of convincing the reader through an series of interrelated anecdotes that circle back repeatedly to the brain function or decision making trait that is being examined.  Gladwell manages to simultaneously entertain and instruct which makes this a book that I would highly recommend. <br />

B000AYEI5Y|5.0|Well, I'm on the clean version of this album because, I have a six year old (who will be seven soon) who listens to this CD in my car stereo. So, gotta keep it clean.      This CD is AMAZING.  I've had this for a week now, and I really like it a lot. The songs on this album are simple yet AMAZING.  The lyrics, melodies, and the harmony are just AMAZING. The words and music are quite heartfelt and would move you.  This is actually a feel good album. If you want to feel good, take 20 mg of James Blunt and you'll feel good - guaranteed.  This kind of album comes along RARELY, and that's what makes this album special.  The songs are passionate such as the song, \\"Goodbye My Lover\\".  The heartfelt and poignant song, \\"You're Beautiful\\", is exactly how I would feel when I see a beautiful woman somewhere, a woman that I'm very attracted to, and manage to have eye contact with her, and in that shared moment, it seems like it lasted a lifetime; and with that as in the video of this song, I've decided to end my life because, I've achieved fulfillment.  Yes, I know, it sounds crazy.    James Blunt has been compared with a lot of fantastic artists, but here's my comparison.  I compare him with the LEGENDS.  In the songs, \\"Tears and Rain\\", and \\"Billy\\", James voice and music style here reminds me of Cat Stevens. I could imagine Cat singing these songs.  In the song, \\"So Long, Jimmy\\", James voice and music style here reminds me of John Lennon. I could imagine John singing this song, too, and in the song, \\"Wisemen\\", James music style here reminds me of Elton John. James Blunt is the NEXT BIG THING to be watched and followed . I can't wait to hear his next album.
0316172324|4.0|I enjoyed this book because Gladwell attempts to quantify and describe something that many people recognize on a subconscious level - that first impressions are very important and that your initial reaction of someone or something often turns out to be strangely prescient.  It's that gut feeling you have upon many encounters, and combined with ongoing new research in the worlds of sociology, pyschology, and even physics (energy + aural relationships) it is very OTM - of the moment.<br /><br />Gladwell uses a sharp, chatty style to the book which makes it a quick read, and the lessons are not difficult.  In general, I would say its better than his first book, which was already an achievement, but the idea is less zeitgeist that The Tipping Point was.  Its more a form of threaded common sense, which seems to be a Gladwell Trademark.<br /><br />It would have been great to see Gladwell focus a bit more on the business side of Blink, like how to use it, but hey, you can't have everything.  It also would have been nice if Gladwell had addressed the Hub Culture angle to the book: social globalization has created this common, linked urban community around the world, and it would be interesting to see how well he thinks they interact, read, evaluate and act upon their first impressions of eachother as they increasingly mingle through travel and virtual communication -- i.e. the modern world isn't just about the US and US examples.

0066620996|4.0|Overall, it was an interesting and very helpful book.  From an employee perspective, it was great to read this book because the management team considers it to be their 'business guide'.  Reading it has helped me to understand why the management style has shifted to allow less of a tightly managed focus and more of a focus on helping employees achieve and be self-disciplined.<br /><br />The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 is that it was too heavy on the explanations of the reasons behind the research and the finer details of the analysis.  Collins's creation comes off as if he's on the defense because of the over emphasis on what was behind the book.<br /><br />I would have liked more content related to the points in the book -- more solid examples.  I would have also liked it if the book had more of a \\"how-to\\" perspective from time to time as well.  It would have made it more interesting and less dry if more of a human element was added instead of all the hard & detailed facts.

B000065BPB|5.0|I've only had these a couple of days but I love them more every time I put them on.  The frequency response seems to be ruler flat.  I'm a bass player and I really like the bass response from these.  Rather than an over powering resonance or boom which can cloak the upper registers of the bass range, I hear perfectly even bass runs across the entire bass spectrum.  In comparison, the Bose QC2's have a huge bass end compared to the 280's so if you really want noise isolatiion and lots of bass they might be a better way to go although the Senn HD-212's are also suppose to be quite bassy for a lot less money.  I have an older, like new, pair of AKG-340 phones which are two-way eletrostatic/dynamic (they cost me $250 about 15-20 years ago).  The overall frequency balance is similar between the two sets although the AKG's have a larger sound field and slightly less distortion.  I don't think anything beats the electrostatic element for smooth sound although I hear the 280's sweeten with time.    I bought the Senn's mainly for use while commuting by buss.  I had been using a pair of Bose QC2's that I bought for use at work. The Senn 280's do an excellent job if reducing outside noise.  The Bose attenuate better at low frequencies but they are similar over most of the frequency range with the 280's being slightly better higher up and at voice reduction.    Someone mentioned them being funny looking for use in public but I find that I am quickly absorbed in the sound (voice/music) from my Sony portable FM radio and forget that there is anyone else around.  The Sony SRF-59 AM/FM radio is also a great product at a low price... check it out.  This morning I was listening to some commentary and the voice sounded so real that I felt like I was listening to my inner voice or something like that....it was really striking and totally engaging....I think I was on the buss????  I can listen to them for long periods with very little fatigue... a sign of relatively low distortion.    They are very comfortable for me.... same as the Bose QC2's.    Well, the sound of my PC is starting to drive me crazy so it's time for a little music.....awwwww

B00004BZ0N|5.0|'London Calling' is the penultimate punk rock album. It is here that Strummer/Jones songwriting reaches its zenith, and it is with this album that they were able to take punk rock to a wholly new level. They rescued punk from what, by 1979, had become a tired legacy of the Ramones and Sex Pistols. The Clash re-fashioned punk rock--which may have gone down as a passing fad by the early 1980s--with depth and social awareness, and instilled undeniable credibility in rock as a form of political expression. Also, London Calling was the foundation that punk, ska, pop, and the rockabilly revival built themselves upon for the next decade (1980s).  <br />     In short, it is a good album. <br /> <br />BM

B000002H6C|5.0|WOW!!! One of my favorite metal records. ...And Justice for All took elements of Kill Em' All, Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets (all great) to create the last thrash CD by Metallica. Blackened is a great opening song but my personal favorites are the title track and The Shortest Straw. Critics of Metallica have said that lead guitarist Kirk Hammett does not do things as technical as former Metallica member and current MegaDeth frontman Dave Mustaine, but \\"Straws\\" guitar solo proves otherwise!!!!! A completely sick descending chromatic scale is a great way to finish off an amazing song. Eye of the Beholder and One are aso great songs. The Frayed End of Sanity and Harvester of Sorrow are good songs, but not as good as everyone says thay are. To live is to die is a good song, a cool acoustic intro leads into total mayhem, but Dyers Eve is the song that defines this CD. Fast, loud, what more do you want? It expresses anger at parents, society, government. Amazing. Could not reccomend it more. If you are just getting into Metallica, not a good place to start. Get the Black Album, you will be much happier.
0143036556|2.0|This was a great disappointment after GG&S - the case studies are few, variable in quality and very selective; and his conclusions don't follow from his data. <br /> <br />A book with this title should help us understand, for example, why the Roman Empire collapsed after 1,100 years, whereas the Egyptian civilization lasted 3,000. Instead the author concentrates on failures allegedly caused by environmental problems. <br /> <br />Specifically: <br /> <br />1. To qualify as a serious intellectual exercise, the book needed to cover many civilizations, and spend as much effort analysing the successes as the failures. Arnold Toynbee's \\"A Study of History\\" is such an attempt - analysing in detail every one of the 22 major civilizations & assessing all the factors that led to their rise and fall. And he does convincingly explain why the Romans went south and the Egyptians lasted so long. You can disagree with Toynbee's conclusions, but at least he lays all his data and reasoning before you. \\"Collapse\\" doesn't come close to this standard of scholarship. <br /> <br />2. The author spends 100 pages - 20% of the book! - on the failure of the small Nordic settlement in Greenland, when all you need to know is that it was an outlying colony of Norway that died out when ice (global cooling!) prevented resupply. <br /> <br />3. His argument that deforestation is a Bad Thing seems true for Easter Island. But is clearly not true in Europe, Egypt and much of the rest of the world. Why? <br /> <br />4. He doesn't quantify, except when he forecasts imminent doom. For example, what exactly is the damage we cause China when we send it (plate 27) our cast-off PCs, TVs and cellphones? <br /> <br />5. He doesn't understand technology, saying on page 450: \\"new technology has made it easier for oil companies to operate more cleanly now than in the past\\". \\"Has made\\" makes it seem that the new technology just happened, but of course people had to decide to invent it, to finance the development,to figure out engineering solutions, and then finance their deployment. This lack of comprehension rather undermines his authority to assert (page 504) that technology won't solve our problems. <br /> <br />6. He treats human induced global warming as a fact, saying (p425) that \\"most professional climatologists previously skeptical of the reality of global warming became convinced\\". So that makes the still-skeptical climatologists amateurs? <br /> <br />7. His rebuttal of One Liner Objections to his predictions of environmental doom (pp503-514) would be more convincing if he addressed Lomborg's demolition of many of his arguments in \\"The Skeptical Environmentalist\\" <br /> <br />8. Finally, he argues that the interconnectedness of the world's cultures - he call it globalization - is a new phenomenon. It's not - if you read Toynbee you'll see that the barbarians attacking the Roman empire 1600 years ago were being pushed by yet other waves of barbarians. <br /> <br />Still, the Easter Island chapter was illuminating.

I have read a lot of reviews that smash this album as being \\"metalcore\\", \\"pop\\", etc.  Perhaps you would rather be listening to Jessica Simpson, Black-Eyed Peas, or Kanye West???  If you do not think that this is a good ROCK album you should be listening to the aforementioned Pop/Rap crap because you obviously do not appreciate the sound of REAL instruments.  Now...  I am through venting.   <br />For a true roller coaster ride of emotion, musical prowess, and originality--BUY THIS ALBUM!!!  First of all the vocalist does an excellent job considering the fact that he suffered through the agony of ripped vocal chords and was required to have them reconstructed in turn learning to sing all over again.  The drums are fantastic, and while not the greatest, they do serve their purpose in the rythm section.  Thirdly, there IS a bass--those rythm changes are NOT only guitar and drums.  And lastly, the guitar work is some of the most extreme that I have heard in quite some time--while not necessarily the fastest or heaviest--the rhythm goes from heavy to soft to middle-of-the-road while the lead overlaps the rhythm through transition of verse to bridge to chorus.  Synester Gates is one of the best new guitarists out there.  The songwriting is exceptional. <br />These guys are helping in the return of ROCK.  For that alone they would not receive a bad review from me!!

B0002J4ZWS|5.0|The Shawshank Redemption is widely considered to be one of the greatest films in history, and that claim definitely is valid.  Telling the stories of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) and Ellis \\"Red\\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), the film looks at the brutality of prison life and how sometimes, the most human people in the prison are the prisoners as opposed to the guards. <br />Convicted of killing his wife and the man she was sleeping with, Andy is sent to Shawshank Prison, one of the grittiest and most terrible prisons in Maine.  The warden, Sam Norton (Bob Gunton) is a stern man of God who is a crook at heart; he \\"allows\\" Andy, who is a former banker, to manipulate the prison accounts so that he can appropriate extra money.  The guard captain Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown) beats prisoners with very little provocation, in fact, he had his men beat a man to death on his first night because he was crying.  However, the prisoners aren't saints either.  Beatings, rape, and other kinds of abuse go on between prisoners, and the guards tend to let it happen.  Meanwhile, Red looks on as Andy slowly adjusts to life at Shawshank.  Red is \\"the guy who can get stuff\\", and Andy begins requesting strange items.  He asks for a rock hammer so that he can continue his hobby of geology and he asks for a poster of Rita Hayworth in order to have something pretty to look at.  Andy and Red become friends, and soon Andy is fairly popular around the yard. <br />He cements his status as the favorite of both the guards and the prisoners when he gives valuable financial advice to Hadley in exchange for getting some beers for his friends.  Soon, Warden Norton employs him in the prison library, which he turns into the most comprehensive and well-run prison library in New England.  Eventually, Andy becomes the go-to guy in Shawshank, turning felons and guards into more civilized people. <br />In addition to the story, the movie has great themes and observations.  Throughout his sentence, Andy claims thathe is innocent of the crime.  After he begins doing shady accounting for Norton, Andy comments to Red that it wasn't until after his incarceration that he became a crook.  The ideas of hope and fear are expertly dealt with in the film.  Both are seen as having the possibility to do good or evil, and it all comes down to how we want our lives to turn out. <br />For a movie about prison life, The Shawshank Redemption is surprisingly uplifting.  It has numerous moments of intense violence and hatred, but overall, it is a story about hope and the goodness that can exist even in the hardest of convicts.  This movie should definitely be on every person's list of movies to see in their lifetime.

B00005K3OT|5.0|Chocolat is a fantastic film for its filmography.  The location the movie is set in is wonderful with actors and actresses who make it a believeable situation.  Each character is developed fully by the end of the film so each person is real and the viewer understands the emotions and actions they take.  And how can you go wrong with Johnny Depp.
0517543052|5.0|It's hard to imagine the impact this book had when it first came out - the format, the design and typography, and of course, the message. Be Here Now has aged a bit - feeling somewhat like watching a Laugh-in rerun. A real 60's rush. Sometimes naive, sometimes right on. But then again, the message was and is and will be right on - especially for those trying to find meaning in life, trying to find their center. Ancient wisdom wrapped in 60's dreams.<br /><br />Be grounded. Be Here Now. Let Ram Dass show you the way.
1582403589|5.0|Wow!!!  I've been a lover of all things Zombie for a long time.  How did I miss this series?  Oh well, this trade collects the first six issues of Image's \\"The Walking Dead\\" series written by Robert Kirkman.  This series really surprised me.  I was expecting your typical violent horror comic, but this wasn't that at all.  This(the first 6 issues anyhow)is a much more character driven story than anything else.  The blood & guts are still there, but not nearly as much as you might expect.  It asks the question \\"what would you do if the world was turned upside down?\\".  The story follows officer Rick Grimes.  In the beginning you see Rick get shot and hospitalised during a routine traffic stop.  Aparentally he falls into a coma for some time only to awaken to see the dead have returned to life and are eating people.  If there were ever a comic that needed to be brought to the screen it's this one, whether it be the small or silver screen this would make one hell of a picture(Hey Hollywood, *Hint* *Hint*).  Anyway this really is a great book all the way around, check it out.

B0000027RL|3.0|Everyone already owns this album or has at least owned it at one point, so I can't exactly say anything revelatory. And I will admit that the Pearl Jam/Nirvana comparison has been dragged to the ground. But that won't stop me from adding to it.    Here's where the problem lies for me. The grunge scene largely progressed from the DIY bands of the eighties, such as the Minutemen, Black Flag, et cetera. Grunge took the sincerity and honesty of the punk era and evolved it into something else, replacing anger and demands for change with apathy, while still keeping a sense of malcontent. Nirvana captured the preminent feelings of the early nineties so well that they changed music - and the culture in general - forever. So when people compare Nirvana to Pearl Jam I have to wonder where they are really coming from, other than they evolved at the same point in time and came from the same scene. Pearl Jam is an arena rock band at best. Pearl Jam tried to be deep and sincere and dramatic (think \\"Jeremy\\", or \\"Alive\\") in an ara of cynicism, indifference, and boredom. Nothing wrong with that - in fact, more power to them. But maybe that's why when I listen to Ten today, it sounds like an irrelevant and untouchable (read: unrelatable) bunch of arena rock songs, whereas when I listen to Nevermind, at least I can still sense the honesty and pure nature of the work, knowing exactly where it came from.

B000AARKOO|3.0|This film moves in the same vein of the earlier Gladiator but this lushly filmed fable doesn't quite have the tightness and snap of Gladiator.  Rydly Scott generally directs  films that are always beautiful to look at, with detailed and interesting historical contexts and dramatic panoramas.  This is no different and for this alone the film is worthwhile.  Orlando Bloom does a credible job and most of the supporting cast is exceptional.  The script however is uneven, defective in places and jolts around like it is looking over several plot lines before settling on one. Jeremy Irons and Liam Nilson, after good performances, stumble out of the film incongruously and create an imbalance in the flow of the story.  This could have been a much better film if more attention and talent were lent to the script.  Still, if you like flashy historical fables like I do, you will probably like this film.
B00005RYKV|4.0|Brother (Takeshi Kitano, 2000)<br /><br />When I see a film that has both the names Ren Osugi and Ryo Ishibashi in the credits at the video store, I know I'm in for a good time. Brother did not disappoint.<br /><br />Kitano does what so few foreign directors manage to do: come to Hollywood and make a good movie despite having to work within the strictures of the MPAA. That said, the DVD release is, of course, unrated; it makes me wonder what on earth the MPAA found so objectionable that the film would have required an NC-17 rating had it not been cut. (One note on IMDB mentions that not only was the movie cut, but cut heavily.) Just another confusing moment trying to figure out the MPAA.<br /><br />Brother may not be Takeshi Kitano's best film, but it's still a lot of fun. Aniki, a yakuza (Takeshi) displaced by the merging of his former family into that of their rival is marked for death, and his best friends are ordered to perform the hit as a test of their loyalty. Instead, they allow him to escape to America, where he goes into hiding with his younger brother, Ken (Beat's Claude Maki), and Ken's band of small-time dope dealers. Well, yakuza-born, yakuza-bred; Aniki sees an opportunity to build an empire from scratch, and he takes it.<br /><br />Rather than attempting to work out how to take a story conceived in his native land and adapt it to an American treatment, Takeshi comes up with an idea (or, perhaps, managed to put himself in a position where he could make a movie he'd been thinking about already in the best way possible) that blends the two cultures, and turns the movie, at least in part, onto a meditation between the differences between the two.<br /><br />That, however, is not what you will notice while watching the movie; what you'll notice is the movie itself. That's part of the magic of films like this; things are moving so fast that you don't really have time to look at the deeper aspects until later, but those deeper aspects will be easily found with a few moments of reflection. While you're watching the film, though, you're far more likely to notice the acting (Takeshi himself simply exudes cool, and even House star Omar Epps manages to use a few expressions that have not crossed his face on a screen before), the camerawork, and the violence. Maybe I'm used to Takashi Miike movies, but to me, the violence in Brother seemed almost understated much of the time; while the movie's body count is admittedly high, those who have seen Ichi or the Dead or Alive trilogy will certainly find nothing here nearly as ostentatious.<br /><br />Fun, fun movie. If you missed it the first time around, now's a good time to catch up. *** ½ly found with a few moments of reflection.

B00005JOFO|4.0|Brokeback Mountain (Ang Lee, 2005)<br /><br />When it comes to the hallowed halls of the overrated director, there are few names that inspire more impassioned defense from those who think he's the second coming of Jesus than Ang Lee. (In fact, off the top of my head, I can only think of two: Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick.) Did anyone really like The Ice Storm? Really? Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is considered great by Americans who've never seen a wire-fu film before, and even Lee's greatest defenders will concede that one must overlook The Hulk when putting together Lee's resume for the hall of fame induction ceremony.<br /><br />Then there's Larry McMurtry, the second huge mistake made by the powers that be who decided to make this film. There's a reason no original McMurtry screenplay has made it to the big screen since Falling from Grace thirteen years ago. While McMurtry's long-winded, lackadaisical style makes for arguably decent novels, it's hell on a screen. After all, think of how much had to be pared from Terms of Endearment, Lonesome Dove, or The Evening Star to whip them into shape for filming.<br /><br />All that said, both Lee and McMurtry have made a career-best film with Brokeback Mountain, which is a good movie-- a very good movie-- straining to become great. One thinks that had a truly great screenplay writer adapted this (say, Rafael Yglesias, or maybe David Peoples), and a director whose work actually lives up to the hype been behind the camera (say, Julian Schnabel, or maybe Marc Caro), it would have been one for the ages.<br /><br />As I'm sure everyone on the planet and their dead mothers are aware, Brokeback Mountain is a love story. The principals here are Ennis Del Mar (10 Things I Hate About You's teen heartthrob Heath Ledger all grown up) and Jack Twist (Bubble Boy's Jake Gyllenhaal), who meet one summer when hired to herd sheep on Brokeback Mountain in what seems to be north central Wyoming-- in other words, as far from civilization as one can get in America and still actually be in America. During the months the two are up there, they develop a relationship that haunts them the rest of their lives. The two both end up married, Ennis to childhood sweetheart Alma (Dawson's Creek's Michelle Williams), Jack to rodeo queen Lureen Newsome (The Princess Diaries' Anne Hathaway, even more all-grown-up than Ledger); the movie tracks the twenty years after Jack and Ennis' first meeting in 1963.<br /><br />First, the good things about the film; Lee has actually learned how to handle a scene where characters are talking about sex without having his characters come off sounding like embarrassed preteens (one of The Ice Storm's great failings). All four of the principals turn in fine acting jobs. Heath Ledger not only gets an American accent right, but a Western drawl. Gyllenhaal can make anything (with the exception of The Day After Tomorrow) worth watching; he turned the utterly stupid Bubble Boy into comic genius, and took a script for what had hope only to be a mediocre teen flick, Donnie Darko, and made it into one of the best-loved cult films of the last decade. It's no surprise that he does well. Hathaway and Williams, on the other hand, are complete surprises. The cinematography, as is to be expected, is fantastic (one of the things I will remember about this movie for the rest of my life is the scene where they're first herding a river of sheep up the side of the mountain), and the story comes together well and stays together, for the most part, throughout.<br /><br />Were it that simple, this would be a great film. The flaws in it, however, are not to be overlooked. The film could have used a good editor; it's not that there are any scenes that need taken out wholesale, but trimming ten seconds here and twenty there in all the places it could have been done would have easily dropped the film under two hours, and made it a far better-paced affair. (The one scene that could have been removed entire was the final scene; Ennis driving back across the same road he'd hitched a ride up in the movie's opening shot was an obvious place for someone to say roll end credits.\\" No one ever did.) At least one subplot vanishes into thin air just as it gets interesting (Jack's ongoing battle for dominance with his father-in-law). The makeup guys spent way too much time looking at pictures of Robert Redford before aging Heath Ledger for the second half of the movie-- but on the other hand, the aging makeup here is top-notch (certainly Oscar-worthy, ironic as makeup is one of the few categories in which the film wasn't nominated for an Oscar). The timeframe (by necessity, of course, but it still could have been done better) expands during the last half of the movie, and it gets overly choppy as it does. (It's not a question of confusion-- it's easy to keep track of where you are-- but of certain decisions on where to cut scenes and the like.) And some of the editing in the film makes me surprised it got off the ground. I'm willing to give the film's worst edit the benefit of the doubt-- the projectionist when I saw it might have screwed up changing reels, rather than a jump that bad actually being in the film-- but there were too many overly abrupt edits in the film for it to have been reel-changing every time.<br /><br />None of these things on its own is enough to drag a film down, probably, but added together, they speak to the ability and lack of experience (odd, in such an experienced group) of the crew who put this film together, and cannot be overlooked. Not, of course, that they haven't been by millions of fans. This movie has been lionized by the gay community in the same way the Christians lionized The Passion of the Christ last year. The difference, aside from the fact that it seemed to me that this film was supposed to come off \\"a love story\\" and not \\"a gay love story,\\" is that The Passion of the Christ was, technically, a perfect film, or as close to it as you can get. Brokeback Mountain is a good film, to be sure, but it's far from perfect. Still, it's a good film, and one worth seeing, especially for Jake Gyllenhaal fans. *** ½en removed entire was the final scene; Ennis driving back across the same road he'd hitched a ride up in the movie's opening shot was an obvious place for someone to say roll end credits.\\" No one ever did.)

1591391105|5.0|When transitioning to a new position, you can find countless volumes available that will be helpful. However, most books written on the subject are geared to a rather exclusive audience relating to upper management. CEO's and COO's can find a seemingly endless supply of resources. THE FIRST 90 DAYS by Michael Watkins reaches much deeper into the management food chain with techniques and strategies that are applicable whether you are at the senior management level of a Navy Seaman being promoted to 3rd class Petty Officer.<br /><br />Watkins introduces what he terms the STaRS model, which teaches the newly promoted leader to first identify the status of the company for which you are involved, be it Start up, Transition, Realignment or Sustaining Success. This is critical to success, as each business modal must be approached with different strategies.<br /><br />Though this book would be beneficial for anyone being promoted from within an organization, I personally believe is greatest value would be for an outsider first coming in to a new company in that it covers many things that often are overlooked by newly hired managers, such as culture adjustments and team development.<br />Above everything else, Watkins teaches the importance of timing. Newly hired or promoted managers all to often, make the right decisions, but at the wrong time. This goes back to the STaRS identification and the importance of knowing what mode your company is in before making changes.<br /><br />The book reads quite easily. Watkins effectively gives real life business examples of successes and failures and does so in a way that these examples can easily be applied to countless situations. Whether you've just received your first promotion ever with only one subordinate under your supervison, or are taking over a Fortune 500 VP position with hundreds of people on your team, you will gain critical insight to how to succeed from this book.

B000AWYOGE|3.0|Dark Water (Walter Salles, 2005)<br /><br />I was all set to write this great review about how Salles had broken the \\"brilliant South American directors imported to Hollywood\\" jinx, how Dark Water was the best remake of a Japanese New Horror film America had ever seen, with seven hundred or so words waxing philosophic on what it takes to adapt a Japanese flick to American audiences and how Salles and Rafael Yglesias had managed to capture it all so very, very well.<br /><br />Then came the last fifteen minutes of the movie, which I am convinced neither Salles nor Yglesias had anything to do with (and I'm not terribly sure anyone else who made the beginning of the film did, either). It's like an alien EMP washed over the set and clicked everyone's brains off, turning Dark Water from an intelligent, scary film into the kind of preprocessed pablum that Hollywood horror films have been made of, in bulk, since I Walked with a Zombie. (For the record, there is almost no doubt in my mind that the hand of producer Roy Lee was far more involved in the final fifteen minutes of this film than the first ninety.)<br /><br />So I'll do my best to concentrate on the first ninety minutes of the film when writing this review, because you really should see that part of it. After that, turn it off and go rent the original Hideo Nakata film from 2002, which has a far more satisfying ending to it. Besides, you should see all of Nakata's movies, which are uniformly brilliant.<br /><br />Salles (Central Station, The Motorcycle Diaries) and Yglesias (Death and the Maiden) took Taka Ichise (To Sing of Love)'s original script (based on a short story-- not a novel, as both the film and IMDB mistakenly tell you-- by Koji Suzuki, the guy behind Ring) and did a good deal of work on it, which may be the first time since the remake craze began that a script has really been reworked to an extensive degree by a top-notch screenwriter. The end result was good enough to lure some pretty big talent, and it all comes together quite well for an hour and a half.<br /><br />Dahlia (Requiem for a Dream's Jennifer Connelly) is presently going through a divorce from her husband, Kyle (Dougray Scott, from the highly anticipated upcoming TV series Heist) that's getting nasty. Caught between the two is their daughter Ceci (Ariel Gade, of the TV series Invasion). Kyle is moving to Jersey City; Dahlia can't afford that, so she goes looking at project-style apartments on Roosevelt Island. Murray (Gangs of New York's John C. Reilly), a slick used-car type, tries to sell Dahlia on a one-bedroom in a building Ceci describes as \\"creepy,\\" but by the time they've finished looking at the apartment, Ceci desperately wants to live there. No sooner have they moved in than odd things start happening, all having to do with water.<br /><br />Connelly, Scott, Gade, Reilly, Pete Postlethwaite (The Constant Gardener), Camryn Manheim (The Tenth Kingdom), an utterly unrecognizable Tim Roth (Reservoir Dogs), and an even more unrecognizable Elina Lowensohn (The Wisdom of Crocodiles) all turn in wonderful performances in this movie. (Well, okay, every time you see \\"this movie\\" from here on out, add \\"the first ninety minutes of\\" beforehand.) The only constants are Connelly and Lowensohn, who plays her mother in flashbacks (the two of them constitute a kind of good-and-evil matrix around whom the rest of the film revolves); everyone else is a variable, and all of them play their variability exceptionally well. The horror-film aspects of what's going on (which become readily apparent within the first half-hour, but I still won't spoil them for you if you haven't seen the original)almost take a backseat to the far more human drama of Dahlia's life, both in the present (the divorce, her harrassment at the hands of a couple of stoner punks who live in the building) and the past (flashbacks to the hatred and ultimate abandonment she suffered at the hands of her alcoholic mother). As it should be.<br /><br />Those of you who have seen the original will no doubt have realized by now that much of what I'm highlighting in the remake was nowhere to be found in the original. And this is what makes the remake of Dark Water such a potentially great film; while it kept the trappings of the original, it is very much its own beast, and Yglesias' script seems almost as if he read through Ichise's original a few times, read Suzuki's story a few times for good measure, then sat down to write the horror version of Kramer vs. Kramer, but without the gratuitous JoBeth Williams nude scene. (Which, I feel compelled to add, Dark Water suffers for lacking.) It's an Yglesias script more than it is an adaptation of an Ichise script, and Yglesias is a great scriptwriter.<br /><br />Of course, none of this holds for the movie's final quarter-hour, which exists solely for the purpose of throwing an a whole bunch of cool special effects, and has none of the atmosphere, pacing, and feeling of denouement as the last quarter-hour of the original script does. If you overlook that, this is a film well worth your time. Unfortunately, it's impossible to overlook. ** ½d be. <br /> <br />Those of you who have seen the original will no doubt have realized by now that much of what I'm highlighting in the remake was nowhere to be found in the original.

B0000028UK|4.0|4.5/5    Nevermind burst open grunge music into mainstream America. Ten solidified it. And while many flannel-clad kids were waiting for  Jeremy II: Tales fom the Underworld, Pearl Jam presented us with what I believe to be their best album so far.  Much more diverse and bold, Vs. enjoys a powerhouse in the Abbruzzese/Ament drums/bass combo. Vedder's lyrics go up a notch while his vocal performance sounds primal and angrier.   Gossard and McCready, in turn, begin to learn to play off each other. In all, an incredible album that helped define an era.    Go. - Dave Abbruzzese kicks off this album with bold, hard drumming. After a short pause, at 00:29, all hell breaks loose.   Jeff Ament drives through with an impressive bass riff that nicely complements Dave's drumming. The rest of the song has Eddie Vedder wailing away \\"Don't go on me\\" on top of muscle riffs by Stone Gossard, interjected by speedy, Mike McCready solos. In all, an outstanding way to open up an album. 4/5    Animal. - The album speeds up with Animal. Harder and grittier than Go, Animal has Vedder in primal rage. Special note must be given again to the awesome Abruzzese/Ament combo. 4.5/5    Daughter. - The first Pearl Jam ballad, Daughter deals with a young girl with ADHD. Superb. 5/5    Glorified G. - The story goes that Abbruzzese, who is incidentally from Texas, shows up one day with two guns: purpotedly for self defense. The guys didn't take it too kindly  as evidenced by this song. The track is about the gun culture in the US and how some people glorify their guns as if they were gods (note the play on G.) This song is extremely funny (especially when they sing together \\"glorified version\\" and when Vedder says \\"KINDred to be an American). Moreover, Abbruzzese does some strangely uplifting drumming (strangely since the song is, if the rumor is true, making fun of him).  Nonetheless, the lyrics fall short of Vedder's capabilities. 4/5    Dissident. - Along with Animal and Daughter, Dissident is oneof the more popular tracks in the album. Not as hard as the first two songs, but not as soft as the third, Dissident is in many ways the \\"Alive\\" of Vs. Both share similar anthemic structures. Vedder sings about someone who shelters a dissident for a while, but then hands him towards the authorities. However, she regrets having done so for the rest of her life. 4.5    WMA. - The Ament/Abbruzzese combo shines here once again. The entire track works on Ament's bass riff, complemented by some innovative and complex drumming. Vedder and Gossard stay in the background while McCready shows up sporadically. After a while, though, you start getting bored with the repetitious riffs and Vedder screming \\"Policemen.\\" At that time, 3:25 to be exact, the track explodes much a la Animal. The rumor here is that Vedder was once talking to a black friend when a white cop showed up. Ignoring Vedder, the cop started to harass Vedder's friend. Apocryphal or not, this is a solid song on racism. 4/5    Blood .- By far the hardest song on Vs. Blood talks about how he feels shortchanged and manipulated by the media. Specifically, by Rolling Stone (\\"Roll me over\\"), Spin Magazine (\\"Spin me over\\") and Circus Magazine (\\"F---ing Circus\\"). Also, there is some interesting play on words with \\"Painted Big, Turned into of his enemies,\\" which can also be read \\"Paint Ed big, Turn Ed into.\\" Vedder does something similar in Daughter with Violins/Violence. Overall good track, but I find such extreme screams unbecoming of Pearl Jam. 3.5/5    Rearviewmirrow .- Along with Evenflow, I think Rearviewmirror is the best, hard song Pearl Jam has ever composed. But whereas Evenflow starts off hard, Rearviewmirror takes its time. The track is about leaving an abusive situation, and how things become clearer as you achieve some perspective. Apparently, the song was written about Vedder's relationship with his stepfather. Anyway, this is, needless to say, the best track on Vs. 5/5    Rats .- Even though Vs peaks withRearviewmirror, Rats is far from an underachievement. The Ament/Abbruzzese combo and Vedder's primal growl are both back, to great effect at that. The track compares rats to humans in a, well, not so favorable way. Also, we have some funny references to Ben of Willard and Michael Jackson fame. 4.5/5    Elderly Woman .- Another solid ballad. This song has different levels of meaning, from the superficial about an elderly woman in a small town to a reflection on our mortality. Also, it is extremely catchy. 4/5    Leash .- Like Breath and Love Boat Captain, Leash is one of those few instances where Pearl Jam shine in their optimism. Here Vedder advises us to take control of our youth  and get rid of the authoritative leashes put on us. What else can I say, but...drop the leash, drop the leash...GET OUT OF MY F---ING FACE!!! 4/5    Indifference .- Indifference is the first step into what will culimante with Nothing As It Seems. Brilliant as it is haunting, Indifference talks about despondency and deppression.  The track falls in line with Pearl Jam's tendency to end their albums in a contemplative note (forget the stupid mop that was to come next!) 5/5    One last note: Dave once said that even though Dave Kruzen's work in Ten was technically good, it was far from bold and aggressive. After hearing Abbruzzese's work in Vs. you'll know what he was talking about. The Ament/Abbruzzese combo is truly something to behold.
B0002S947K|5.0|I've heard only a little bit about Ray LaMontagne before I bought this CD. So I decided to take the risk and buy the CD, rather than download it off the internet. I'm so glad I took that risk! <br /> <br />This CD is beautiful. It reminds me of good folk music, pop, and some blues all mixed in one. Be ready to catch yourself singing along, getting lost in the music, and feeling moved by the music.  <br /> <br />Ray LaMontagne has some SERIOUS talent and it's wonderful listening to someone who plays for the music, and not the fame, MTV appearences, or the money.
068484267X|5.0|I own the recorded version, which was recorded by the author.  It is beautifully done and provides great insight into the life of ordinary people.  McCourt's Irish brogue provides the essential color needed for such an interesting life story.
B000002GWN|5.0|This album came out the year I graduated from high school, so it holds some great memories for me. Outside of sentimental value, it's just a fine representation of Joni Mitchell's talent. I very rarely enjoy live albums, but this is one of my top ten albums of all time. I have owned this album in every form from 2 record set, 8-track, two cassettes and finally CD. If you are a fan of Joni Mitchell this is the CD to have. Some may be put off by the live performance because it's not studio quality. Joni brings the crowd into the concert and drags you along for the ride. A standout performance of 'Rainy Night House' is one of the highlights that I think is better than the studio version. There is more personality in these songs and will transport you back to a simpler time in music. A can't miss CD.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Like all of Radiohead's work OK Computer is a masterpiece but even by their incredibly high standards it has a level of complexity, consistency and emotion that surpasses ANYTHING ELSE. <br /> <br />The only downside to this is even after many initial listens it can still sound BAD. Karma Police will sound great straight away but is unlikely to be your favourite track by the end of your OK Computer affair. Let Down and Paranoid Android will no doubt sound bad if you are not used to Radiohead. Despite their flawless beauty and intense emotion they appear erratic and boring at first. <br /> <br />OK Computer is a plain girl without make-up that you only fall in love with because you had mind-blowing sex together. After your sonic intercourse has consummated your relationship with Radiohead - she will then dress up for you. <br /> <br />Every song kisses your mouth, strokes your skin like a satin wave and like any good lover gives you enough intellectual content to think beyond the sensual. Exit Music climaxes like an orgasm whilst the lyrics of Climbing up the Walls paint a dystopian vision of Orwellian omnipresence that screams into our conservative malaise. <br /> <br />I first listened to OK Computer in its entirety last year at the tender age of 17 and it changed my life. It got me listening to songs that weren't about girl issues yet still stimulated all the desired feelings of self-contemplation and empathy. I was listening to another left-wing, creative genius that I could both relate to and be in awe of. <br /> <br />If this review seems pretentious, perverted and immature then listen to OK Computer, where that trinity of negatives is absolutely nowhere to be heard. <br /> <br />Brilliant.

055380457X|4.0|I have read the critics about the book and they seemed to praise the book so high or criticize badly. So here's my opinion...<br /><br />The book starts with the founders, Sergey and Larry, their personalities and how they came together in Stanford. It goes on explaining step by step how Google was established.  The working conditions, lunches, snacks, people, company culture is very well expressed in detail.<br /><br />For the ones who can read between the lines, there are also good management lessons. I will not say anything about them but rather leave those to the prospective readers to find out.<br /><br />If you want to try in your company what Larry & Sergey did in Google, think for yourself: Am I so smart as these guys? Personally I am not, and therefore \\"I will not try these at home\\".<br /><br />Some readers argue that Google is praised in the book, which I don't understand, because the book explains what has happened, not what someone had said. If quotes from the people are good, then can we conclude that the book praises Google, and serves as an advertisement?<br /><br />If you want to learn what two out-of-this-world-brains did, how they established a company like Google, I recommend this book. It is an easy, quick-to-read, enjoyable book.<br /><br />I deducted 1 star from the book because it's written as a series of newspaper articles rather than a book.

B000060MMI|5.0|A little less harsh that Swagger, the addition of the banjo adds a new flavor to this great band's work.
B000063UR1|3.0|Great Theme of the movie, that of the last plant life being preserved on spaceships far away from polluted Earth, it being worth owning just for that. But besides that the movie is second rate with inferior acting and special effects. Despair of main character (played by Bruce Dern)and callousness of the rest of the crew is well represented but not much else. Overall boring. Did enjoy the occasional singing. Would only recommend for lovers of the botanical theme of saving the last plant life from destruction and willing to pay the price to do so.
0307276902|5.0|I thought A Million Little Pieces was a excellent book.  I read it when it first came out.    As one who knows a lot about drug rehabs,  I found it very true to life inside such a facility.  Admittedly he may have jazzed it up a bit but I am sure that everything in the book either happened to him or to someone he knew. Life in a rehab on the whole would not be very exciting reading.  It consists of meetings and work and sleep.   It is an unnatural environment.  But it can be hell.   James Frey did a great job of letting us get into the mind of an addict.   The fact that he has overcome his addiction and is back in the real world makes him a hero in my opinion.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|Best movive of that year... and still one of my favourites... <br /> <br />I have to say, when I read the back of the blockbuster explaining the movie, I didnt have high expectations, a big rabbit and the relationship betwene the rabit, time and this kid. <br /> <br />IT IS A GREAT DVD........ after I watched it twice as a rental, I bought this directors cut.... <br /> <br />pretty deep plot, keeps you guessing right up to the end.... <br /> <br />what can i say.. FANTASTIC and will always be one of my very high favourites. <br /> <br />
B00006LLOB|4.0|Imagine the Rolling Stones as a rhythm section, Eric Clapton on lead guitar, and Stevie Winwood on keyboards.  Heck, even you singing in your shower could sound good.  Wang Dang Doodle is such a killer song, Clapton's guitar simply sings, and is so elegantly and tastefully done, you don't know its Clapton, but instinctively look at the CD notes to see who was playing those tastey licks! <br /> <br />This vinyl record was one of my all time favorites.  When it came out on CD and remastered with bonus tracks, I ignored the stupidly high price and took a leap of faith.   <br /> <br />If you like Clapton's blues guitar, Stevie Winwood's piano and the solid rhythm of the Rolling Stones (and who doesn't), you will love this album.  I'd give it 5 stars, but I'm stingy with stars, so a 4 star it will have to be.
B00004RF9B|5.0|All I can say a classic movie. Many elements that were later in Star Trek TV series are here, from the transporter beaming down to the mission itself being a rescue mission. After watching you wish there were more adventures of the crew! but alas there were none. Mystery, Romance, Science Fiction all wrapped into one, while special effects are top rate with no flaws. Of course, I wish I had a wide screen TV to enjoy the WIDE Cinemascope of the movie but will have to wait for extra cash for that. Enjoy!
B000BVQ9JO|3.0|first album can be listened to all the way through...their second and third releases have like, 4 or 5 good songs tops...so, worth buying if you like buying cds with 4 or 5 good songs tops.<br /><br />p.s.- never been a fan of strokes' lyrics, but these definitely blow harder than the others.
B000301YY8|4.0|I was hooked on  James Blunt's slightly ragged yet soft voice when I heard a clip of \\"High,\\" the opening track on this album, in a Hilton Hotels ad. Just as I discovered him, the second song on the CD, \\"You're Beautiful,\\" became a smash hit. Mr Blunt's soothing, slightly feminine vocal recalls an early Rod Stewart fused with Supertramp's Roger Hodgson while his deeply personal lyrics are mature given that this is his debut. \\"High,\\" \\"Beautiful\\" and \\"Goodbye My Lover\\" are the best tracks here.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|I had a feeling that I would really like \\"Walk the Line,\\" but I had no idea that is was such an AMAZING film! I didn't know Joaquin Phoenix had it in him. He did an incredible job bringing Johnny Cash to life. The movie chronicles Cash's rise to fame, his severe drug problem, and his relationship with June Carter (Reese Witherspoon). Phoenix and Witherspoon are PHENOMENAL! It would not be possible for anyone to portray Johnny and June with more accuracy, and their singing is FABULOUS! This movie is such a wonderful tribute to Cash's life and music, and it's also a beautiful love story. (I completely teared up during the final concert scene at the end of the film...how romantic!) In addition to Phoenix and Witherspoon, the supporting cast boasts excellent performances by Ginnifer Goodwin as Cash's first wife, Vivian, and Robert Patrick as Johnny's father. Everything about this movie is perfect...I was sitting on the edge of my seat the entire time!<br /><br />A lot of great movies were released last year, but \\"Walk the Line\\" was definitely one of the better ones...it is a MASSIVE OVERSIGHT that the film wasn't rewarded with a Best Picture nomination by the Academy Awards committee. Hopefully Phoenix and Witherspoon will walk away with the top honors, though...they definitely deserve it.

0143036556|2.0|Diamond's book does a fairly good job at evaluating the conditions of societal collapse, but his theory lacks the modern analysis of imperialism, which is an enormous factor in collapse today as resources are brought out of the third world into the first for consumer purchase. <br />Diamond's personal interjections break the flow of the book, and often are quite offensive, \\"The U.S. explicitly forbids the importation of kangaroo meat, because we find the beasts cute, and because a congressman's wife heard that kangaroos are endangered.\\" Diamond's personal commentary has no factual basis to support it, and is quite offensive. <br />Collapse approaches potential solutions but instead favors a small, insignificant substitutions for \\"unsustainable factors in society.\\"
0895260131|5.0|Let me start by saying that even if there are parts of this book that will prompt strong disagreement from any atheist, I strongly urge atheists to read this book.  In terms of disagreement, Spencer's frequent comparisons of Jesus to Mohammed will strike most atheists as somewhat annoying, but we should agree with his overall point in these comparisons. Jesus was a much nicer guy than Mohammed, a blood thirsty warlord.  More seriously, Spencer's Christianity leads him to some blatant distortions of the truth.  For instance, at the end of the book, he claims that Christianity has never influenced US foreign policy, but certainly US relations with Israel have been impacted by the Christian Right's love for the state of Israel.   <br />We should overlook these petty disagreements.  This book explains why Islam is a far greater threat to the idea of the secular state than is Christianity.  As atheists, we may even need to ally ourselves with Christian Right groups to better combat the threat of Islam.  In particular, this book details how the Politically Correct would like to utterly lie about Islam and claim it is a religion of peace.  It would be disastrous for atheists to let the Politically Correct get away with this.   We need to stand with those parts of the Christian Right who will tell the truth about Islam, even if such Christians are those Christians we find most vile.  We mustn't forget that while the Christian Right is our enemy within the Western tradition, they are a part of the Western tradition with it secular tendencies that we must defend at all cost against the forces of fanaticism.
B00005ASHM|5.0|I'm a Beatles connoisseur. A die-hard. I've walked across Abbey Road (with a cigarette in hand, though it was too brisk to go barefoot), quaffed pints in the Reeperbahn, and could point out fifty \\"Paul is Dead\\" clues. I've burned through a bookshelf of biographies about the band and I noticed that the Beach Boys' 1966 album Pet Sounds is continually mentioned whenever the end of the Beatles' touring days and the start of their `studio years' is discussed. With its 40th anniversary looming I started to wonder about Pet Sounds. <br /> I always dismissed the Beach Boys as a half-baked band who parlayed a bunch of sunny tunes into a bubblegum legacy.  While Brian Wilson could be considered  the group's only gifted musician, but the boys could definitely sing. Gorgeous harmonies filled their 45s, but their words were always about things which were alien to me like surfin' and California sunshine. So, why the hubbub surrounding Pet Sounds? \\"No one is educated musically until they've heard Pet Sounds...It is a total classic record that is unbeatable in many ways\\", Paul McCartney proclaimed. Wow. Powerful, yet not as bold as what Beatles Producer George Martin said: `Without Pet Sounds, Sgt. Pepper wouldn't have happened... Pepper was an attempt to equal Pet Sounds.\\" What the hell made Beatle Paul, Sir George Martin, and countless other music luminaries bow to 1966's Pet Sounds? I was about to find out. <br /> The other night I dug out my copy of Pet Sounds, which I half-heartedly listened to a few years ago before tossing it to the back of my collection, and I listened to it...and listened again. My original lukewarm judgment of the album mirrored the American record buyers of 1966 when LP peaked at #10 and failed to go gold. I spent the evening playing and replaying the album. A hearty auditory diet of Pet Sounds followed for the next few days. It became the soundtrack of my driving, my meals, and even my showering and shaving. The songs grew on me like a suntan-and I became more and more engulfed in its richness and splendor with each listen. As Pet Sounds connected with me through my earphones, I thought about how striking the sounds were and how naive I was to have dismissed them years ago.... <br />  <br /> After suffering two nervous breakdowns, twenty-three year old Brian Wilson stayed home in L.A. while the Beach Boys (with Glen Campbell filling in for Wilson) continued to tour in autumn of 1965. He suddenly had time to work on his new project- a project that was to show his newfangled musical vision- but was unsure of his direction until the Beatles' Rubber Soul became the catalyst for his new mission. \\"Rubber Soul was a collection of songs ... that somehow went together like no album ever made before, and I was very impressed. I said, 'That's it. I really am challenged to do a great album.\\" Fueled by barbiturates and good vibrations, Brian Wilson diligently worked through January and early February 1966 with lyricist Tony Asher penning songs with lyrical themes which evoke both the passion of newly born love affairs and the disillusionment of futile romances. Brian looked beyond the conventional guitars and keyboards when he hired and recorded some of the industry's best session musicians to play the backing tracks for the new material. Breathy saxophones, rolling accordions, piping flutes, Baroque harpsichords, pounding tympanis, regal English and French horns, and even some melodious oddities like Coca-Cola bottles, bicycle bells, and a ghostly sounding theremin are all interwoven into the album's rich fabric. When his band mates returned from their three-week tour of Japan and Hawaii, they laid down the immaculate vocals that blanket the record.  <br /> The result is an astonishing and harmonious orgy of sound. Wilson painted a dense and melodic landscape whose hills far out number its valleys. Pet Sounds is a gem from the opening blissful guitar plucks of the youthful anthem Wouldn't it be Nice to the crestfallen soundsof the barking dogs and passing train of the dirge Caroline, No. Brian's buttery voice on You Still Believe in Me and Don't Talk (Put your Head on my Shoulder) sends shivers down my spine. The heavenly God Only Knows, with its wintry sleigh bells and clip-clop percussion, melting vocals and marriage of horns and strings, make this an album highlight. Brian hands younger brother Carl the lead and the band recorded one of the loveliest and most divine songs ever heard on a pop album. \\" It's a favorite of mine...very emotional, always a bit of a choker for me,\\" McCartney said of the song.  The song's unorthodox opening line of \\"If I should ever leave you,\\" is the cherry on top of the sundae for me. Perfection.  <br />Pet Sounds is the crest of Brian Wilson's wave. He was able to use inspiration from across the pond and thread it into a richly textured and intricate piece of stunning pop. It was his vision, his baby, his masterstroke. His soul breathes through the vinyl.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|The Tagline of the Movie: \\"The one man she cannot stand, may be the one man she can't live without.\\" <br /> <br />The new version of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a must own for lovers at heart. Wonderfully casted by Jina Jay, she brings the story of the prideful Elizabeth Bennett and the prejudiced Mr. Darcy to life in this updated classic. Starring in the lead roles Keira Knightly,Matthew Macfadyen, and along with other well known actors Donald Sutherland, Brenda Blethyn and Judi Dench. <br /> <br />This remake blends the unique acting of today with the glorius scenery of the past. Keira Knightly proudly shows that she is a very powerful Elizabeth Bennett, especially in a wonderful night scene shot with Judi Dench along with the scene's shot with the gentle Donald Sutherland. Matthew Macfadyen positively shines in his role as a tormented and shy man trying to overcome his prejudice to win the woman of his heart. <br /> <br />Yet I will remark that for those that see this, try not to compare it with the wondefully done BBC miniseries version starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle done in 1995. Now while I enjoyed this film and found it exhilarating from beggining to end, it does go very fast at certain parts and slow it seems at others, but overall a wonderful remake of the famous book, and a version for any true lover at heart.
B000E97X66|5.0|...even if, like a lot of us Boss fans, you purchased the deluxe \\"Born to Run\\", which contained a DVD of this exact, very same performance, this is still worth buying again as a CD. It's THAT good. I have one of those theater-in-a-box systems, so I wanted to hear this over my \\"real\\" stereo, which has, as my neighbors would tell you, a lot of oomph...and boy howdy, this does not disappoint - the sound is brilliant and the concert gels so nicely this works without visuals...I am wasting my breath (keystrokes?) though - everybody who HAS to have this probably already does.....
0790732254|5.0|Liz Taylor's absolute best performance ever; this was the 60's version of \\"Mommie Dearest!\\"  Shocking for its time, but, unlike \\"Mommie Dearest,\\" a multiple Oscar-winner. Like many posters, the first time I saw this movie (at age 15), I was emotionally wiped out by the end. A mixture of tragic drama, electrical tension and some hilariously campy moments (\\"Our son's eyes are blue Martha..\\"  \\"Green You Bastard...\\") LOL!  Outstanding performances by all, Ms. Taylor, the late Sandy Dennis...what a travesty that Richard Burton lost the Oscar for this, he was superb. Also, if you ever get a chance, see \\"Virginia Woolf\\" dubbed in German, it is a hoot and a half! And late at night, watch out for any speeding '62 Ford Galaxie station wagons!
0393317552|5.0|Guns, Germs, and Steel, by Jared Diamond, was one of the best books I've read in a long time.  Basically, it's a world history -- but it would probably be more illuminating to say it's a history of prehistory.  It tracks what we tend to know about time periods that precede what we normally learn as \\"history\\" in order to try to build an answer to the book's central question: why did western Europeans sail across the ocean and conquer/exterminate Native Americans, rather than Native Americans sailing over to Europe and conquering it?  Obviously, because the Europeans had better technology, but why? <br /> <br />When I've seen commentary about this book, I've seen much of it praise Diamond as giving a \\"non-racist\\" account of history -- because Diamond's answer to this question is not \\"because Europeans are more intelligent.\\"  It is, roughly: \\"Eurasia is a larger land mass, oriented on an east-west axis (cf. Africa, America) and because it contains more plants with large seeds suitable for domestication, and fewer geographical barriers than Africa/America (e.g., deserts), and because most of the large animals in Africa can't be domesticated and most of those in America became extinct (due to hunting?) about 13,000 years ago.\\" <br /> <br />Diamond makes some weak comments about race (to paraphrase one: \\"the average New Guinean I've met seems to me smarter than the average Westerner\\") but really the book isn't about race at all.  It's about the factors that led to the world we know, in terms of the distribution of power, but also the processes that led up to \\"history\\" (why was writing developed?  what motivated people to grow food rather than continue to hunt and gather?  why did European diseases -- the \\"germs\\" in guns, germs, and steel -- overwhelm Native Americans; why weren't there Native American pathogens that infected and exterminated Europeans attempting to settle?). <br /> <br />I had no idea how much was known about all this stuff, and it's certainly never beenexplained to me in any way that I could assimilate it.  Diamond did that for me.
0451197968|3.0|This book took a long time to get moving. So much time was wasted with the main character Ben Richards going through physicals and other inane activities, that it took over 80 pages to get moving. I still gave it 3 stars for one reason though: the ending. I though the ending was pretty good and wasn't one of your typical \\"happily ever after\\" ending (like the one in the film, yeccch!) It had a really dark ending with a bit of victory on the main character's part (not the type of victory you're probably thinking of.) <br /> <br />Bottom line: worth a single reading, but the reread value is zero, in my opinion. Rent it from your library if you're going to read it. If you're going to purchase a King book, steer clear of the Richard Bachman books (except for Thinner, that was pretty good.) If you're gonna purchase a King book,buy The Dead Zone, Christine, Thinner, Pet Semetary, The Stand, It, Different Seasons, Everything's Eventual, or Night Shift (my favorite.)

B00005JOQ9|1.0|I am a first generation American with very close ties to his European roots.  I love Europe and have visited many European countries, including Slovakia.  I am not of Slovakian heritage, but this has not prevented me from deeply appreciating this beautiful country, its culture, and its people.  <br /> <br />Eli Roth, however, has no sense of any aesthetic appreciation for anything of worth.  Instead, he apparently must take the beautiful and destroy it with a hideous presentation of falsehood. <br /> <br />Roth presents Americans as a bunch of moronic heathens; European youth as stupid mindless buffoons; European women as cheap whores; and Europe as some abandoned no-man's land of a nightmarish post-industrial ruined landscape.  This is not Europe or how European women are in general; nor is it how Slovakia is specifically.  And if Eli Roth ever spent any time in these beautiful countries, he'd have known better. <br /> <br />I wish to impress upon some of the Slovakian reviwers below or others coming here to read this, that just like in any country you have stupid money-obessed people, such as Eli Roth.  Most Americans are decent people, not wishing to see violence or thinking such stupid ideas of another's culture.  At the end of the day, when all is said and done, beyond race, culture, or gender, we are someone's son or daughter, perhaps a father or mother, and more than anything else--part of the human race.   <br /> <br />On  that note, what makes a good movie for me is one that highlights our common humanity and is universal to whomever watches it.  Here in the US, many film producers make the big boom-bang \\"Star Wars\\" kind of movies.  They are nice to look at and sometimes have a nice story, but usually it is the special effects that rule.  In Europe in contrast, the human story rules, and I love that.  American films, however, sometimes have a great story to tell.  Just think of \\"Cinderella Man\\" that came out last year (a beautiful and true stroy of early generation Americans suffering the Great Depression as told from the life of an older boxer).  In movies like this, you see the humanity in everyone. <br /> <br />But what has Eli Roth made?  Garbage!  Just pure garbage.  There is no story here.  There is no sense of humanity.  Everything is evil in mankind and the world, if we are to believe Mr. Roth's warped, disgusting world view.  Life itself is but death and its only purpose, according to Roth's presentation, is to destroy--not celebrate our common unity and humanity. <br /> <br />Never have I seen a more shameful, awlful film like this before.  It genuinely left me feeling ashamed that an American had any part in making this stupid film. <br /> <br />I personally do not get the appeal of these movies (and I am not a squeamish one who is easily disturbed by the sight of blood).  What I found disturbing about this film is its celebratory nature of the violence that it glorified in its presentation.  This is not art--but as far as I am concerned, it was an act of cinematic defecation.

0783116934|5.0|This HBO movie about the world's most prolific serial killer was made in 1995 and released on DVD five years later. It portrays a near decade-long pursuit of a real life serial killer in the Soviet Union and the action crosses over the period from 1982-90, from the transition of Soviet Union under Communist control to glasnost Russia under Gorbachev.<br /><br />The film portrays the case of a state forensics expert turned investigator (Stephen Rea from \\"The Crying Game\\"), his relationship with the Soviet bureaucracy, his boss (Donald Sutherland) and a psychiatrist whose insights were critical to solving the case (Max von Sydow). These actors are all marvelous and veteran character actor Jeffrey DeMunn does a more than creditable job as the serial killer.<br /><br />While the story itself is completely fascinating and involving, what I found more enticing was the recreation of Soviet Russia during the period. Filmed in Budapest, Hungary, the movie portrays world military power USSR for what it really is -- a Third World nation whose residents largely reside in poverty and, often, squalor.<br /><br />One of the  great truths of this film is that the killer met his quarry at railroad stations. One of the lesser known secrets inside the old Soviet Union was its outstanding public transit systems, of which the rail program was one. The one thing I found somewhat unrealistic was not a single scene in the dreadful Russian winter, which sometimes lasts 9 months in that part of the world.<br /><br />This is great filmmaking and wonderful storytelling linked with believable acting in every scene. The subplot of Communist bureaurcracy interfering with the police investigation is probably the message most people will remember from this film. I'd advise you to take away the idea that Russia, while one of the great world military powers in the 1980s, was just as gray and miserable a place to live as portrayed in every scene of this brilliant film.
B000059MEK|5.0|Truly, after Daft Punk's huge smash, \\"Around The World\\", no one knew what to expect from these guys. That video was all-around strange, and the song was entrancing and addictive. They followed it up with the eclectic \\"One More Time\\". There really isn't much to the song, but it's marvelously poppy house music. One of the best forays into the genre, actually, because it features just about every aspect of what makes house music fun. The soulful lyrics, the engrossing bassline, and the thumping 4/4 beat. This song is so beautifully simplistic that you can't help but bop along and sing to it. And then there's the video...who could forget the video? A futuristic world, complete with happy small people, flock to a concert featuring aesthetically pleasing band members (and a small person on drums) playing, you guessed it, \\"One More Time\\". Did I mention this video is drawn anime-style? The slow bits are all 80's montage style, and it's just funky and fun. But wait, what's this? Invaders, right at the end? And yeah, that's where it appeared to have stopped. <br /> <br />Now I have to take a moment and talk about something else. I cannot actually review this album without taking a few minutes to talk about one of the coolest musical experiences of my recent past. Interstella 5555 is the anime completely drawn to the album Discovery. This movie follows the travels of this aesthetically pleasing band, as the invaders come and capture the stars and remove them to a far distant planet: Earth. Security at the invaded planet has just enough time to send out a distress call in the shape of an electric guitar, which gets to a ship shaped like an electric guitar. Not before we get a chance to meet the pilot, who, it seems, is obsessed with the pretty lady guitarist. He follows the ship, and crashes on earth. The band members are taken and systematically made human (they were blue before), given sunglasses with sensors that appear to be mind control devices, and set to become the nexthuge thing in the world market, musically speaking. Even their memories have been reconditioned so they believe they truly are human. It's an amazing experience, and I recommend it to anyone and everyone. <br /> <br />So back to the album. The general feel-good feeling continues across the 14 tracks, whether through lilting melodies or nigh-grunge power chords. Some tracks have vocals, others do not. But the overwhelming feeling throughout the CD is definitely, \\"HAPPY\\". They define themselves with songs like \\"Something About Us\\", \\"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\\", and \\"Digital Love\\". Actually, the middle track is something of a precursor for the strange song \\"Technologic\\", which is featured on their most recent album. It's such a strange song, it features fragmented lyrics that eventually blend together to create coherent sentences and melodies. The song is composed of almost mechanical beats and sounds, and it only compliments the creepy robot-like vocals. The album continues into the overwhelmingly exciting \\"Crescendolls\\", which features a rising crescendo and an all-too-happy crowd going, \\"Yay!\\" \\"Woo!\\". Other great songs are \\"Face to Face\\", and \\"Too Long\\" which is actually 10 minutes long. It is absolutely engrossing though, the 10 minutes never seeming long *enough* by the time it is done. I cannot rave about this album enough! <br /> <br />A, hands down.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Wow!  I've seen nearly all the film versions of Pride and Prejudice, and this one is by far my favourite.  Here, viewers are treated to gorgeous cinematography showing off amazing English vistas.  Of course, I realize that this film is not a verbatim play by play of the book, but it certainly caught my attention and kept me interested straight to the end.  Keira Knightly is perfect as Elizabeth (\\"Lizzie\\") Bennett.  She plays Lizzie just as I imagine her, headstrong and passionate.  I also love Matthew McFadden as Mr. Darcy.  He is very sexy!  Plus he doesn't play as stoic a Mr. Darcy as Colin Firth in the BBC version.  In this version of Pride and Prejudice, Mr. Darcy is visibly affected and thrown off by his attraction to Lizzie from the very beginning.  Some reviewers may object to this lack of subtlety and nuance, but I found it appealing.  Overall, I think this film was aimed at a younger audience.  The dialogue was less 19th century English, but more of today's plain language (note, the use of \\"divine goddess\\" etc.).  The film also focused more on the Bennett family and the romance between Lizzie and Mr. Darcy rather than the broader scope of the book which focuses on social structure among other things.  While this Pride and Prejudice may not appeal to Austen purists, I was thoroughly entertained!
B000E1155E|2.0|You Brits upset me. I love british music, well mostly anything from overseas since i hate American music. This album is not that good. I actually give it 2.5 stars just cause there are a couple of okay songs on it. This much hype for this cd is terrible. When i bought Oasis's first cd back in 94 i was 11 and blown away at the sounds. Even Pablo Honey, which i was is better than this. Their sound isnt anything new and for a first cd its ok.
0345440900|4.0|I found this book a bit uneven.  Some of the advice was terrific (such as how to identify your baby's cues), and some of it was just silly (such as the breastfeeding section, which is controversial and not really relevant to keeping a schedule, and Hogg's advice not to buy pull-over shirts for your baby).  I also found the book surprisingly short on practical advice: after reading it cover-to-cover, I was at a loss on where to start with my baby.  When I tried to muddle my way into it, I quickly got confused and frustrated, and the book was no further help.  Fortunately, the community group web site picks up the slack -- in fact, I would reccommend skipping the book (or borrowing it for a quick read) and going straight to the web site.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Quentin Tarantino is a dumbkuff director, his film Jackie Brown FLOPPED and makes one movie per decade. Cranky is all wrong the pickle puffer. Scarface is a classic movie with more thrills and chills. Al Pacino's role as a gangster has been imitated more than enough times. People still like this movie today whilst the dumb Brokeback Mountain will be forgotten. Watch or HEEGOTCHA!
B00068NVI4|5.0|This concert is one of the best I have seen, and this DVD is a \\"Must Have\\" for collectors or fans of YES in general. I played this for my 16 year old one night, now I have to buy another one because he won't give it back (he watches it every night).
B0001KZM3O|5.0|Along the lines of The Wall, relating a story of war time in the past, the Final Cut has far more of a melodic tone that really captures the feelings and emotions in a way you can relate to them.  <br /> <br />Yes, it does have more of a Roger Waters feel, so if you don't like his music, this might not be the CD for you. The flow of the songs from one track to another is incredible.  <br /> <br />Unlike The Wall, the tempo of this CD is much more low-key, making it a great CD to relax while listening to it. Bought the CD 15 years ago, and I still listen to it all the time.  <br /> <br />
B000BEZQ18|5.0|Excellent!  I have listened to the CD over and over again and cannot get enough of the music that is part of this wonderful movie.  I have seen the movie three times at the theaters and I would go again and again.  Pieces of art like this movie are rare to find.  Wake up America!  Same-sex love is here to stay.
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead's 2000 album Kid A is a classic. The album was Radiohead's first and to date only US #1 album and held those poseurs Green Day off #1 and the follow up to the Million selling OK Computer and this album too sold a Million in the US alone going Platinum! This album features great songs like Optimistic, The National Anthem, the title cut and Morning Bell. If anyone hates this you deserve a GOTCHA!
0446677450|4.0|Gives good food for thought concerning personal finance, careers and wealth. Good for adults to consider how they think about and handle money and also parents for how they teach their children about money. Not a step-by-step, DIY book, but a thought-inducer.
B00005JO1R|5.0|I bought the 2-disc collector's edition, and I agree with some reviewers that more could have been added or used; such as actual pictures and video footage of Johnny Cash, some music videos, etc. As for the movie itself, I would lose all respect for the Academy if both Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix are not awarded Oscars for best actress/actor respectively. So many actors and actresses impersonate real people, but with their performances, Witherspoon and Phoenix WERE the real people. I was also very pleased with the factual bases of the movie, as opposed to other biopics movies where Hollywood embellishes stories and takes liberties that are out of character or untrue to the subject. To no surprise, with T-Bone Burnett as the music head, the movie was great from a music standpoint, capturing the essence of the Cash trademark sound. Burnett has cranked out phenomenal old-style country/bluegrass soundtracks with \\"O Brother Where Art Thou?\\" and \\"Cold Mountain.\\" The icing on the cake is the fact that both Johnny and June had a hand in the movie before their passing in 2004, and their son, John Carter, had a lot impact in it as well. The timing was great too, because after 1968, where the movie ends, everything after that year is pretty well-known and documented about Cash and Carter, and is a part of our culture. What was captured was the little-known details and beginnings of not only Cash and Carter, but the future legends they have worked with. Overall, one of the greatest movies I have ever seen, but more can be done with special features on the DVD. This is a must buy, don't even bother renting it first!
0760750920|1.0|\\"Treasure island\\" was a hard book to understand at my age (12). Its sentences were written in old English, which got you confused.  The sentences were also pretty long.  There word choice was hard and confusing.  On page 118 the 4th sentence has like three hard words.  The description was good but at times the plot was confusing.  A significant event that happened was when the mutineers attacked their ship and killed Flint.  <br /> My personal opinion of this book is I thought it was bad and hard to understand. It was written so far back that the old English was so confusing. It seemed like there were like ten different things happening at one time. So a good age for a reader of this book would be around thirteen and up. Twelve year olds could read it to if you're a good reader. But if your not that great of a reader than you might think the book is confusing like I did. So all in all, I would give the book a three on a one through ten scale.
B000E1155E|5.0|The Arctic Monkeys are a great up and coming band who play no-frills rock and roll. The last one star reviewer is so gay that even George Michael would turn back to straight! If you don't this album I'll yell HEEGOTCHA!
B000022TSW|5.0|For those of you who have been with these perceptive, socially reflective kids from the beginning of the show I know you'll agree that this feature is the greatest justice to the show.  Trey Parker and Matt Stones' musical comedy is by far the most hilarious and enjoyable form of comedy to consume.  This is the film that works you out with nonstop laughter- you will be sore.   <br /> <br />Although you might have seen it a dozen times already on cable, this movie never gets old.  The profane rhyming, the gags, the commentary on mass hysteria are as relevant today as they were in 1999.  If this hilarious, insightful film doesn't make you want to get up and change the world- it'll at least make you wet yourself laughing about it.   <br /> <br />While you would never say such things... you will find yourself singing along to the always very catchy tunes the South Park creators are known for in all of their films.   <br /> <br />As always, no one is spared in South Park; celebrities, political leaders, our neighbors to the north, even South Park rips on South Park.  With every laugh you'll find another bulb lit until your laughing about laughing about laughing.  When your brain finally unscrambles you'll be ready for the next one.   <br /> <br />When you might say \\"no, they didn't,\\" they did.  And not only did they, but they sang about it too.   <br /> <br />While two-part-er episodes are lots of laughs, they lack the special effects animation, the inappropriate nudity and curse words that every teenager lacks in day to day life, and little gems like revealing Kenny's true face.   <br /> <br />It is easy to condemn other shamelessly perverse shows and films, but it is not so easy to do with a show and film that holds its own when condemning the arrogant, the pompous, and the shamelessly ridiculous advocates of censorship that inspired this film.  So while you might be a little standoffish about embracing such a genre of comedy, at least this form provides some not-so-subtle commentary about what's going on in the world before filling it with animated boobs and potty talk.  You'll be too busy laughing to be offended.  Even while you might object to some of the lyrics of the musical pieces; you'll be surprised and impressed by the faithfulness to meter, rhyming, and score.   <br /> <br />This film will definitely put a smile on your face, even if the world is going to Hell. <br />
B000BBOUU4|2.0|I know nobody likes to compare the two versions of Roald Dahl's book, but I am going to go ahead and do so, simply because when one considers the merits of the original version it seems a waste and a bore to remake it. <br />There is one exception to this, and that is the costume, special effects and style - very Burton-esque, but that aside, it is doubtless superior to the amateurish 70s version. However, with this idea, we are speaking under the rule that dictates most of Hollywood these days, and that is that such matters are the make or break of a film. Being a fan of classic film, I nostalgically appreciate a time when this was not the case. <br />The original version of this film gave us everything that mattered on the inside. The only thing that Burton did better was he made the \\"look\\" of the film more modern, something I do not consider important on the grand scale of what constitutes a memorable movie. <br />I am aware that Burton stayed closer to the Dahl book, but what makes a good movie is very different from what works in a book, and I do not think we should be judging the two versions on which is a better replicate. Depp's performance was too Michael Jackson-esque for my liking. He was simply too \\"weird\\". Why does this make a difference? It does absolutely - Depp's Wonka was so preoccupied by details and effects of his own childhood and life that he gave the impression that he didn't care at all about Charlie or any of the other children. In the end, when Charlie takes Wonka into his home, our impressions are confirmed, that Wonka is indeed the main focus of the story. Ironic, since this version bears Charlie's name in the title versus the old one which used the name of Willy Wonka. <br /> <br />The bottom line is, the charm and simplicity of the old version was derived from its focus on Charlie and his modesty, humility and hope. In this version the whole Slugworth story was omitted (the crux of the morality of the old version) and replaced by a storyabout dentistry that attempted to gather sympathy for Willy Wonka. <br /> <br />Also, the Oompa Loompa songs were a disgraceful demonstration of the stupid humor of our times, and moments where there had been a song in the old version were treated with a nervous attempt to evoke laughter (eg Grandpa doing a quick dance when he got out of bed)- an impression of a \\"how can we fill in the cracks?\\" type of approach. <br /> <br />Overall, the only merits of the new version are its special effects and modernity, which are not enough to tempt me to say that it ranks anywhere near its predecessor in terms of value. When will we get away from such a superficial approach to moviemaking? Apart from these details, this movie did not persuade me of the reason why it was remade in the first place.
B000CEVUIK|5.0|When I first considered buying the series, Stargate: Atlantis, I thought it would be a knockoff of the SG1 series.  It has it similarities but I found it to be spellbinding and a great series in its own right. <br /> <br />The star gate is digital and the entire setup seems more modern that the standard stargate.  The crew interact on several occasions with the original cast but the storyline is focused on staying alive in a hostile environment while in another galaxy, the Pegasus system.  The life sucking Wraith's want to take Atlantis so they can gate to Earth for a new feeding ground.  The players try to survive while unlocking the secrets of Atlantis and the Ancients, all while have a good plot line for each episode, which includes gating to other worlds and meeting new people. <br /> <br />This series might not be as enjoyable to anyone who is not familiar with the SG1 series. <br /> <br />My only problem with the series is that year 2 is not available so I can see how they survived the latest attack in the typical \\"to be continued\\" episode. <br /> <br />A note about the pilot, don't buy it if you are going to buy the first year, Its included on the first disk. <br /> <br />I think this series has as much potential as the original series and have no doubt that I will purchase any subsequent years that are released.  That's the highest rating I can give any movie, the promise to spend my hard earned money on buying it.
B00000F169|1.0|Did anyone else watch the same movie that I did?  Or should I say try to watch the same movie that I did?  I am a huge classic sci-fi movie lover and had heard good things about this one.  I was mislead.  I can seriously think of no redeeming value to this movie.  In fact, I am sure that Carpenter and O'Bannon are quite ashamed of this black scar that lingers in their past.  The unwitty dialogue tries to be clever all throughout the movie and is just sooo boring.  The 'effects' don't exist, and the whole alien beach ball thing is just embarrasing.  It's not funny - it is embarassing.  I could make a better movie with a handycam in my garage.

Whether you discover The Show Must Go On (that climaxed the film Moulin Rouge) the way it was originally performed or if you find yourself reminiscing- for those of you old enough to reminisce- about Flash Gordon; Queen - Greatest Hits, Vols 1 & 2, has your rock ballads and opera rock as well as the more rockin' side to Queen.   <br /> <br />You might have sung We Will Rock You, We Are the Champions, and Another One Bites the Dust at your favorite sports arena without ever knowing you were singing Queen.  While you might have dismissed Crazy Little Thing Called Love as Elvis- it's here.  If you've ever seen Highlander the feature, your ears will start tingling when you hear A Kind of Magic.  When Under Pressure starts up on the second CD, don't worry.   Vanilla Ice didn't get in- Queen did it first with David Bowie.  When you hear One Vision as the last song on this double album, you'll be kicking yourself trying to remember where you heard it before.  It's all right, the answer is in the booklet.   <br /> <br />Be careful when and where you listen to this double album because you won't be able to stop yourself from singing along and rocking out.   <br /> <br />Buy A Night at the Opera with this collection and you'll own all the Queen you'll ever need.  Queen will rock you. <br />

B0000524CY|4.0|In the first few years after the 1973 premiere of \\"The Exorcist,\\" a slew of articles and books were released discussing not only the film but the brouhaha that followed its release.  Few movies had resulted in such a heated cultural debate and reaction.  Director William Friedkin, and producer William Peter Blatty, writer of the novel on which the film was based, and also its screenwriter, were interviewed extensively, in endless discussion over how the movie was made and how the final version of the screenplay was drafted.  For his part, Blatty never uttered a single word of dissatisfaction with the final result that hit theatre screens.    Fast-forward some twenty years.  Mr. Blatty began to publicly grumble about some scenes that had been filmed but left out of the final cut.  Friedkin, contradicting what had already been made known in all those books and articles back in the Seventies, vehemently denied that any such scenes ever existed, standing firm that his final cut was perfect and complete.    It looked as though a rift developed between the two, and Blatty announced plans to produce a mini-series version for Fox Television, intent upon transferring the whole of his novel to film.  That never came to pass, and how could it have, given the profane nature of some major plot-points, and the language?  Even Fox Television was not up to it.    Just as press notices about the mini-series died away, plans for the twenty-fifth anniversary edition of the DVD were made known.  Suddenly, those scenes Friedkin had denied ever existed, mysteriously had been found.    Some of those scenes made it onto the Anniversary Edition, in the excellent attached documentary made for British television by Mark Kermode.    Warner Brothers bean counters began to pay attention to all this fuss and money was authorized to dust-off the \\"discovered footage,\\" to see if any more profit could be squeezed from the movie, which had already enjoyed several successful theatrical re-releases around the world.    The result is \\"The Exorcist: The Version You've Never Seen.\\"  Shoe-horned into the movie are scenes that Friedkin had previously acknowledged existed, but had left out in 1973, because he said they slowed down the pacing.  Also included are the scenes Friedkin had denied ever existed.  This \\"unseen version\\" is not only a misnomer, it is only for the diehard fan.  Compared to the original version, it is a curiosity piece.  Some of the previously rejected scenes simply do not work.  The so-called \\"spider walk,\\" in which the possessed girl scrambles down the stairs in an inverted bridge position, clearly suspended by piano wires, looks inane, especially when blood inexplicably gushes from her mouth.  A first visit to the doctor is well done, but the costuming and art direction are so dated, so hideously 1970s, they are humorously distracting.    Some of the resurrected scenes are effective, notably the ones Friedkin lied about.  When the elderly Father Merrin explains why he thinks demons possess people, the movie makes more sense than it ever did before.  It is an uplifting and illuminating moment, and it is very interesting that Friedkin lied about the scene's existence, although at one time he was quoted as saying it was like \\"stopping for a commercial.\\"    The worst aspect of this version is Friedkin's unthinkable tinkering with the music soundtrack and some of the visuals.  Superimposed over dark spots on the screen are images of \\"scary\\" faces and the statue of the demon \\"Pazuzu,\\" with corny accompanying music, the sort that is usually saved for TV films about women in jeopardy.  Ghastly.  Because of some quick cuts of a white demonic face, that some slow-witted critics labeled \\"subliminal\\" in 1973, it appears Friedkin consciously tried to repeat the so-called \\"subliminal\\" effect for contemporary audiences, attempting to scare with nonsensical images superimposed on kitchen appliances and dark corners.  The images do not register as subliminal inthe least, they aren't even scary, they just look cheap, like scrapbook collages.  Heavy-handed music is tossed into other scenes that had previously been quietly dramatic without it.    This is not the first time Friedkin toyed with the original version of \\"The Exorcist.\\" In 1980, a 70mm, six-track stereophonic version was produced for re-release.  While the visuals were left alone, the soundtrack was vamped-up and altered in places, in ways that did not particularly enhance the action or improve the film.  Not all prints were struck in 70mm, and the 35mm prints for that reissue contained only four-track sound.  Ads at the time urged audiences to \\"Hear the Devil for the first time in Stereo!\\"  Since the final product was so similar to the 1973 version, it seemed like a vanity project.    If there is one version for the average collector to own, it is the 25th Anniversary Edition.  If there simply is not enough of \\"The Exorcist\\" to be had, this version is of special interest to the collector.  It is not a vanity project.  It is an actual re-cutting of a classic American movie.  For the diehard fan, at least watching it once is necessary.  One can only hope that this version does not become the definitive one because it is inferior to the original.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I love Jane Austen, always have. And I have seen, I believe every version of P&P that's out there (including the 1930's version and the Bollywood-like 'Bride and Prejudice'. While I love the BBC miniseries version, this one to me, goes in tone and feeling where I don't think BBC had the scope for. I saw this movie not 1,2,3 but 4 times in the theatre. I never got tired of it, but i stopped going because the theatre staff were starting to recognize me on site. This movie is now in the top 5 of my all-time genre-crossing films. I was moved every time I saw it, no matter how the audience was, or who I was when I was watching it. If you haven't seen it, go buy it, because renting it will only cost you more in the end, after you rent it for the fifth time. An instant classic!
0780626966|5.0|I got this box set for my 12th birthday, and I still watch it. Every minute of it is frickin' awesome. Nightmares 1-4 and 7 I watch comepletely through and 5-6 I just kinda skip around to the better moments on them. The only nightmare that really scares me anymore is N1, though my favorite is N3. This review is mostly on the Nightmare Encyclopedia which is awesome. The maze thing is pretty sweet as you collect keys and stuff to find clips of Robert and the guys working on movie sets and old commercials. It was fun learning how Wes came up with the idea for the 1st Nighmare(he had a dream of a man standing outside of his apartment room, I think). It was also fun hearing Robert's thoughts about each nightmare. It turns out that the giant Freddy with heads and bodies coming out of it in N4 was actually 20 feet tall or something.<br /><br /> If you are a nightmare fan and already own all the movies... I encourage you to get this anyway. Seriously, the Nightmare encyclopedia is completely worth all the money. Great set!!
B000B63IEI|4.0|Rachmaninov's first concerto can be labeled \\"Baby Rachmaninov.\\" It was written by Rachmaninov when he was 17/18 (I forgot) and revised before he left for America. Like a lot of people I am a great fan of his second concerto. His first concerto, although less grand in scope, and perhaps less heavy and sorrowful than the second, is very melodic and taunting.         Andsnes interpretation is very neat/clean. He does not distort the music too much. So as long as you appreciate the music you don't get sick of it. But you may not get addicted to it since it lacks subtance and unique touch by the pianist. Andsnes does a very poor job in the climax. It definitely is not heavy and grand as it can be. Otherwise the beginning chords and melody are nice, and the orchestra is great.        The second concerto is HORRIBLE (which is very noticeable, because there are so many great recordings to compare to) In my opinion, Andsnes lacks the spirit of Rachmaninov.
B00004RF9B|5.0|This is the ultimate \\"Classic\\" of all space Sci-Fi movies.  I remember seeing it in the theater when I was a small boy, and being absolutely fascinated and terrified at the proper moments, and this film has lost nothing of what so influenced me as an impressionable youth.  The special effects and scenes portrayed are unbelievable when you take into account what the film makers had to work with back in those days.  Get it, and enjoy it!

B00005Y1TL|5.0|This must be one of Aphex Twin's best albums. It really is a work of art, and perfectly captures the mood of ambient music of the late 80s and early 90s. Classics such as Pulsewidth  and Actium carry you off into other dimensions. If music could be expressed in images, then I think fractals would be the best visual expression of this. <br /> <br />A must have!
B000EHRVP6|4.0|This was a very dark, intense, and sometimes creepy film, but there really are better horror movies out there. There are a few plot holes in the story that can be annoying while you are trying to believe in it. Most of the gore was done extremely well and looks realistic and sickening, except for one effect near the end (an eye wound) that looked really cheesy and fake to me on the big screen.<br /><br />It's a pretty intense and claustrophobic movie, which I think is what it really set out to accomplish rather than trying to be completely believable or artistic.... so I give it 4 stars for that! After you see this, rent \\"Eurotrip\\" to calm your nerves!
B000AGTPUU|5.0|I heard many reviewers and film critics say that the Polar Express lacked the warmth and humanity of a live-action film, that the animation made for plastic, emotionless characters.  I guess these clowns didn't like Toy Story or the Incredibles either.   <br />     The Polar Express was phenomenal.  The attention to detail in the animation was next to perfect, and the story line, although not exactly like the book by any stretch, was warm, and entertaining, with a moral.

B00004XONN|1.0|The fabulous glam disco act from New York, Scissor Sisters, will come out with a new album later this spring.  It will even feature a duet with Elton John, and it's predicted to outsell everything else on the charts.  Wait for that album, and avoid Radiohead, who were DUMPED by Capitol/EMI!
B0007O38F8|1.0|Its hard to describe the disappointment, imagine waking up on christmas day and then opening your presents and what you wanted was a Xbox and you acctually get socks. That is what this album feels like. This album gives the impression that fifty cent wrote a few of the tracks like outta control then gave up. A poor effort by fifty.
B00005JOFO|5.0|\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is the love story of a lifetime.  It's about two cowboys in Wyoming (the home state of that pig Cheney) who fall in love and start a 20 year romance.  I will be STEAMED if this movie loses at the Academy Awards.  It better win or I'll get REAL angry!
B000E1155E|5.0|This band are the saviour of music! I am so glad that this band is starting to gather up speed in the UK because they deserve it. The reviewer who said that they dont have the staying power of Ciara or Justin Timberlake, is very right however because a band like this is not suppose to have staying power like the airbrushed rivals. Genius cannot be kept up. Despite \\"I bet that you look good on the dance floor\\" reaching number one i dont particularly think its a a good piece of song writing but well played by the record company for releasing that song first as it has the most commercial appeal. If you like true music buy this album but if you dont buy it anyway to open your eyes to it.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|My entire family loves this movie. I had purchased it for XMAS gifts as well. The animation and songs are wonderful and entertaining. This movie will hold your attention from begining to end. My kids are 4yrs and 1 1/2yrs old. We watch it a lot. Once I put it on I can count on quiet time for 1 1/2 hours! I would highly recommend this movie to everyone!
B000301YY8|3.0|James is a man with a great talent and a good future in the music industry. However i do think he lacks the guitar and singing ability to convince true music fans. I do sometimes wonder \\"why listen to Blunty boy when you have got Jose Gonzales\\". James has great commercial appeal but i do think his record sales will suffer from \\"bluntlash\\" because when he realeased your beutiful hundreds of thousands of people went straight to the shops and bought the album, so people have already heard his songs so he cant release anymore. I like it but im still doubtful.

B0000047BA|1.0|'some times ago, I bought the 'HOT SPOT' CD after watching the frugal  Hopper film with the same title, featuring Don Johnson. <br />The music itself makes me always missing the singings.  <br />The Instrumentalists will be as good as ever, but the whimpering from the selfnamed 'Father of the Electric Blues' will not !!! do.'  AH <br /> <br />my favourite title on the 'HOT SPOT CD' is the last one: 13 'End Credits'. TAH
6304712944|2.0|Although I loved the actual songs in the movie and the instrumental score was very enchanting, the singers didn't have much talent, so that was extremely disapointing! The only thing good about the movie was who they picked out for Lancelot, he's gorgeous! It was nice to see Arthur talking to Merlyn once in a while. And it was funny to see Richard Harris as a younger man, since I've only seen him as Professor Dumbledore! This movie was supposed to be based on T.H. White's rendition on King Arthur and Camelot called \\"The Once and Future King.\\" They tried to stick to the story line but they left out alot of the most important,funny and exciting parts of the book. We didn't get to see the Questing Beast,Arthur's education with Merlyn where Arthur becomes and communicates with all types of creatures, seeing the companion of Merlyn--the talking owl Archimedes, there was nothing with Gawaine, Gareth, Gaharris and Agravaine, and we didn't get to see Queen Morgause or Morgan La Fey in their Faery Palace, and there was no Robin Wood in the movie! I thought it was overall disapointing.
055321277X|1.0|I admire the actual story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde as well as the personal history and other works of Robert Louis Stevenson. <br /> <br />This afterword, however, of Jerome Charyn's is almost more than I can bear. <br /> <br />I'll be frank.  Is this an afterword with supposed insightful information into the nuances of the story, and or the writer/period/genre, or a freakin book report.  Kids, if you're buying this book for class, get this edition and don't even bother reading the actual story if you're not interested.  Skip to the very back and you'll find all the multi-paragraph quotes you can handle, as well as rambling general encyclopaedic info on Robert Louis Stevenson.   <br /> <br />I think I wrote an \\"essay\\" exactly like this as a freshman in highschool english class and received a C for lack of creativity and effort.  That's not exactly a compliment for you Mr. Charyn.
B00011F5DK|5.0|This game will have you hooked after the first time.  Easily played by four, two, or just one person, you may find yourself wanting to neglect other things to keep on playing.  I would suggest it for ages 8 to adult.  My extended famly is very competitive and we were all hooked after the first day.  I think it's very deserving of the five stars but would suggest keeping it up out of the hands of little ones- game becomes a lot less fun once pieces are missing!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm not good at writing reviews for anything, and never really have in the past. However, I really need to write one about this series ... I can't for the life of me figure out why Fox cancelled this series. It had the making to be the absolute best SciFi series ever produced, far surpassing any Star Trek with it's depth, story, believability and addictiveness (and I'm a Trekkie). Because of the very odd way it was aired on Fox (not in order, pre-empted a number of times, 3 or 4 eps never aired) it was extremely difficult to follow it when it was new, but still managed to win awards and a cult following. The series is even more engaging since it can be watched in order on DVD -- get them, if you're a fan of \\"smart SciFi\\", you'll fall in love with this and end up wishing someone, somewhere would pick it back up and make a season 2 (HBO, Showtime, SciFi???)

B00003CXA2|5.0|I have watched that movie in the movie theather. It has been a long time tough. It is a very nice and touching movie. I cried at the end. I do not know if there is a need to write review about Forrest Gump movie. Everybody knows how wonderful the movie and Tom Hanks are.
B00005KHJR|3.0|I saw this film for the first time recently, and was intrigued by the themes in the film, notably the information on pagan philosophy etc.  <br /> <br />I will not comment on the technical aspects of the film, as they have been covered in other reviews, though I must say I thought Woodward in particular played his role very well. <br /> <br />I think any viewer knew \\"something bad\\" was in store for Howie when his seaplane failed to start when he wanted to return to the mainland for reinforcements ! <br /> <br />What I do want to say is this. I am a Christian, and for me the most ironic part of the whole film was when the pagan Lord (Christopher Lee) said to Howie \\"you know nothing about real sacrifice.\\"  The great irony is that Howie knew more about real sacrifice than ANY of the island people, as he knew the Lord Jesus Christ had died for his sins in His sacrificial death. And that though he died a painful death, Howie ultimately had the \\"last laugh\\" as he would be with the Lord forever...whereas unless the pagans repented of their evil deeds, they would be damned forever. <br /> <br />I think the film makers \\"acknowledged\\" something of this when we see Howie about to die in the Wicker Man at the end of the film. Although the islanders were celebrating etc we also see Howie praying and praising God, knowing that when he died he would be with the Lord Jesus Christ. And I believe the film-makers captured something of this paradoxical hope and joy that Howie had. (Reminded me of the Protestant martyrs who were burnt at the stake under Queen Mary.) <br /> <br />I also appreciated the tactic Howie used to try and appeal to the islanders when he was about to be taken to his death. He appealed to them that by killing him would NOT guarantee a good harvest - and then he used the tactic of saying \\"and if you do not get a good harvest, then next year you will have to sacrifice your leader\\" (referring to Christopher Lee.) For a few seconds, you could see Lee realising what Howie said was true, and had a look of fear - but quickly hid this by saying \\"but we WILL get a good harvest this year !\\" and then encouraging everyone to continue taking Howie to his death. <br /> <br />So, I think the real twist of this film is that though the islanders SEEM to have won, it is actually Howie who gets the real victory. <br />

Yes I know this \\"album\\" has been out for quite some time, but I just couldn't figure out a way to review this without people thinking that I am 50 bashing. \\"Get rich or die trying, we thought you were hot. Now the same ni@@a brought us to the Candy Shop\\". Yup, I quoted Game. I don't really care about their little tiff, but the man has a point. What happened to 50, a.k.a. Ferrari, a.k.a. f-50 a.k.a the man who blew up without airplay? I'm not one of those all underground hip hop fans, but 50 shouldn't have forgotten about his fans who don't watch TRL or 106 and park. You killed Ja rules career(thank Jesus!!), and now you are Ja rule. Damn. I do, however like 2 tracks on here, Position of power and This is 50. Thats about it. Yup, I bought it the day it came out and gave it to my niece 3 days later. Apparently, if you are not 14 and in a training bra, this is not for you. Big dissapointment. Lets hope that the third time is the charm.

B000E5KJF2|4.0|We had a great time the other week seeing Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, a fun and clever take on Raymond Chandler-style film noir. Impressively, the film succeeds in being both a pastiche and a parody of film noir at the same time. While we laughed heartily and often, this was no Naked Gun-style send-up of the genre. Instead, the characters often traded witty barbs, and the script mined the rich vein of ironic potential in taking the 1940's genre and relocating it to the present day. While the noir texture was faithfully preserved, with all the traditional characters and the seedy parts of town, modern elements (such as a gay detective, the Hollywood club scene, the \\"industry\\", and people with dyed spiky hair) were seamlessly spliced in without compromising the Double Indemnity look and feel. This clever device allowed the movie to be alternately suspenseful and funny without breaking the mood. Robert Downey Jr. is terrific as the likeable petty thief (whom we first meet robbing a toy store trying to find just the right toy for his nephew's Christmas present), Val Kilmer's deadpan timing is dead on as the hard-shelled homosexual detective, and Michelle Monaghan is great as the lost hometown girl gone to Hollywood. Definitely check out this clever comedy. <br />
1932100385|5.0|I read this book because I am a golfer who has a hard time perfecting my swing.  I have a big belly that gets in the way. During a telecast of the Golf Channel, Gary Player, the golf pro, endorsed this book as a must read. What most amazed my wife and I about Mr. Player was the vitality and youthful appearance of the texture of his skin. He looked in remarkably good condition for a man his age and he attributes his good health to a plant-based diet. I believe him. So being the son of a diabetic parent and grand-parent, and sporting a rotundus torso medius, it would be ludicrous of me not to attempt Dr. Campell's inoxuous and simple diet. I owe it to my golf swing and my health. One week into the diet I have experienced no hunger, lost a couple of belt loops to the thinner, and am sleeping better. This sounds like a testimonial and you may view it as such, but I actually believe Dr. Campbell will change forever the way we look at food. <br /> <br />I think it was Einstein who spoke about not looking for the right answer but rather, more importantly, asking the right question. Dr. Campbell's thesis is that most nutrition studies never ask the right question. The China Study seems to ask the right question and enlightens the confused world of nutrition.   <br /> <br />
B000E1ZBH2|4.0|We greatly enjoyed seeing the new adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. Jane Austen's stories are rich romances, featuring strong and spirited women who seem like they won't get the man they deserve, and the men are often not what they seem at first blush (both good and bad), but character always triumphs over class and money in her endings. In this story, protagonists Lizzie Bennett and Mr. Darcy spar engagingly like Beatrice and Benedick until the inevitable reconciliation. Keira Knightly is perfectly cast as the spirited Lizzie, and Matthew MacFadyen is marvelous as the brooding and taciturn Darcy. The story has been very nicely adapted to the screen by big screen newbies director Joe Wright and writer Deborah Moggach (though rumor has it that Emma Thompson had some hand in the dialogue; she is credited on the film with \\"special thanks\\"), in a sensitive handling that focuses on the romance and the character judgments (and mistakes) that people can make. Beautiful shots of English countryside, together with some very subjective camerawork contribute to the story. (One memorable scene: when Lizzie and Mr. Darcy are dancing at a crowded ball, and for a moment we see the scene as Lizzie does, as if they are the only two in the room, providing a nice depth of feeling in contrast to her seemingly aloof repartee.) The cast are all excellent, but especially notable are Donald Sutherland as the loving father Mr. Bennett (who truly wants his daughter to marry for love), Tom Hollander as the mousy and obsequious Mr. Collins, and of course Judi Dench as the imperious Lady Catherine de Bourg. The costumes, settings, and even the blocking (all that courtly bowing) perfectly recreate the texture of the period. The superb 1995 adaptation of Sense and Sensibility was a hard act to follow, but Pride and Prejudice lived up to our great expectations.

B000BCE918|4.0|<br />Like the others say, a movie is good when you can watch it years later and still feel the thrill and excitement of the first time you watched it.  Definitely recommended for anyone who doesn't have all or any of the movies yet. <br /> <br />However, my biggest complaint is the subtitling.  I have become accustomed to turning on subtitles for DVD movies and close-captioned for aired TV shows.  It's a way I can enjoy the movie without wondering \\"What? What did he say?\\" in some scenes. <br /> <br />The subtitling for all 3 movies in this package are all over the place.  Instead of using the black space below the film footage, or a small section of the bottom of the picture, the text is in huge letters that are put on the left, right, bottom of the screen whenever there are several people talking together. <br /> <br />Eg, one character says, \\"Look out for the raptors!\\" and the text appears on the left side of the screen covering about half of the picture.  Another character says at the same time \\"Let's run!\\" and now that is on the right side of the screen....all in annoying big letters right in front of the images we're supposed to see. <br /> <br />Great movies, bad subtitling job. <br /> <br />

1592400876|1.0|Some of the worst writing I've ever read. And I read a couple of books a month (and have written a variety of materials over the past three decades and develop an eye twitch at the sight of misplaced commas and such). Ms. Truss' main problem is not that she writes in a more convoluted style than Shakespeare, nor is it that she is a stereotypically wordy Limey. It's that it takes her so long to get to a point (and her points are frequently in conflict with the American language so as to render them dangerous) that -- well -- let's put it this way: The entire book is 204 pages long. The introduction ends on page 34! The fact is, I have yet to discover a point to this book. Lovers of punctuation are better off reading the Chicago Manual of Style.
B000B8QF14|2.0|As soon as I'd bought this album, I listened to it nonstop for three days and the after that period of so-called \\"pure happiness\\", I was bored out of my mind and have not even touched the album for three months. <br /> <br />I really liked how the album seemed to have a mix of the old and new songs included on it, all performed very well live, but it was spoiled.  I hate how Billie Joe had to stop playing and start protesting in the midst of a song and then restarting the song and/or adding new lyrics that didn't need to be there, completely straying away from the purpose of playing the music.  His statements were in the contexts of George Bush being an idiot, America being stupid, America being comprised of idiot rednecks, or how great Green Day is as a \\"punk rock\\" band; it was annoying.  Please, Green Day is great in concert, but if you want to hear a guy with probably the most nasally high talking voice protest to a bunch of British people, then buy this, but if you want to hear a compilation of Green Day's old and new songs, buy either American Idiot or International Superhits. <br /> <br />DVD: <br />Okay, this DVD was more overproduced than the album itself, none of the so-called pre-concert footage was not made before the concert.  It is so stupid how these idiots at MTV try to get people to believe that most of the stuff they film is \\"real\\", how idiotic.  Anyway, the in-concert parts could have stood alone from the whole CD and the FAKE remainder of the DVD, it was the EXACT same music on the CD--meaning that the album was a complete waste of time and a DVD should have been released instead.  <br /> <br />Please, don't buy this for the CD, buy it for the DVD if you want to see a Green Day concert.  The CD is the exact same thing and could be replaced with the band's other album instead of being wasted with live tracks.

B00005JOIF|5.0|Steven Spielberg became a most noble director decades ago, and now, over a thirty-year period, he has progressed into a higher standard, a direction in which aging filmmakers rarely go. I can only name two other directors who have followed the same path-Clint Eastwood and Martin Scorsese-but Spielberg has marinated in excellence for so long that his wide range of films have each become synonymous with his name, instead of the actors who starred in them. He has conducted a number of great films, a number of thought-provoking masterpieces, in which his brilliance as a director has added a counter resonance to the material he works with. He brought us visitors from outer space on three different occasions. He made dinosaurs walk the earth. He told a vivid World War II drama with a heartfelt passion. There will probably never be another director like him.     And now, he has taken perhaps the boldest move of his career, and probably the greatest risk in the history of filmmaking. This move, which can only be described as the kind you make in a chess match, is \\"Munich,\\" a dramatic thriller that spawns from the film industry at a time in which its historical context is very much alive. This, I believe, is the movie that Spielberg was born to direct, because alien visitors and prehistoric beasts cannot hold a candle to the importance of what he has brought to the screen. As a Jew himself, he has refused to take sides, which would be difficult to begin with since his countrymen have disowned him and since the Palestinians have likewise denounced him. Instead of criticizing and attacking, he chooses to depict and dramatize, showing that, after all, the continuous ongoing conflict will not be settled by fighting and foreign policy, but by agreement and systematic compromise.     There is even something to be said about the attitude that Spielberg has while behind the camera. \\"Munich\\" is probably his angriest film to date, while also being his most effective and most powerful.What bubbles to the surface during the story is a graphic critique on terrorism and foreign policy during the last forty years. In context, the lessons that the film teaches us are likely to surface a broad range of emotions in the audience members. We are angry because men, who are, by our definiton, evil, kill innocents. We are saddened because we realize that very little was gained out of the events of the film, and that others may have lost their lives in vain. We are confused by the policies carried out on both sides of the film's struggle. We are frustrated by the different views that the characters hold. If ever there was a film that burdens the audience while also managing to fascinate and engulf, it has to be \\"Munich.\\" This is one of the best films of the year.     Throughout the film, Spielberg puts a well-developed emphasis on the events that took place during the early hours of September 5, 1972, and, in one of the most dramatic sequences of the year, the days that followed. As the film opens, eight members of the Palestinian terrorist group Black September break into the Munich Olympic Village and take eleven members of the Israeli Olympic team hostage in their dormitory, killing two in the process. As the media covers the chaos, Avner (Eric Bana), a small-time agent for the Israeli government, and his pregnant wife Daphna (Ayelet Zurer) watch the events unfold on television.     Shortly after the incident, with all of the hostages murdered and the terrorists taken out during a bloody airport shootout, Avner is summoned by Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush), a high-ranking Israeli intelligence officer, to take a bold and dangerous mission: assassinate eleven men who were apparently behind the tragedy in Munich. He is accompanied by four other men: Steve (Daniel Craig), an opinionated getaway driver, Carl (Ciaran Hinds), the clean-up man, Hans (Haans Zischler), who can forge documents, and Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), who is in charge of explosives. These are ordinary civilian men, save for Avner, who, although he is a favor-man for Israel, has been worn down with the responsibilities of a husband and expectant father. Carl, for example, was an antiques salesman and Robert was a toymaker .     Their mission requires them to move across Europe and locate each person on the list, and to do so Avner enlists the aid of Louis (Mathieu Amalric), whose employees can locate anyone wherever and whenever. With the whereabouts of their targets being generally unknown, getting help from an outside source is not such a bad idea, except for the source doesn't align itself with governments or morality. Later in the film, the group gets the idea that Louis and his men are giving away information on Avner's team, and the dynamics of this possibility begin to plague the men with distrust and paranoia.     What makes the film fascinating is it's exploration of the assassinations themselves and what the five men must do in preparation for each of them. After the first target is taken out with guns in the lobby of his apartment, the team decides to move on to plastic explosives because then you won't have to look the target in the eye. One of the film's most exhilarating moments is when the team, having already planted a bomb in the target's apartment, fails to realize that his daughter has re-entered the house after leaving for school. The gimmick works so that when the telephone rings and is answered, the bomb is armed and can be detonated via a remote control. The girl answers the phone, and Carl, who is making the call from a phone booth several hundred feet away from Robert, Hans, and Steve, is immediately stunned by the voice. Hinds' reaction is exemplary acting, but I want you to notice how Spielberg handles this moment. He doesn't emmulate the soundtrack with exhilirating music, but instead allows no sound at all, as Carl and Avner run in desperation to prevent Robert from detonating the bomb.     Moments like these, and countless others,deliver the kind of jolty suspense that you would expect from Alfred Hitchcock. That's what makes \\"Munich\\" such an effective thriller, and within it's context are a number of harrowing questions, some of which are asked by the characters themselves. Why must a country compromise it's own values in order to defend them? Are these targets really linked to the Munich massacre? What evidence is there against them? What is being gained out of this? When the Palestinians begin to fight back around the world in response to what Avner and his men are doing, the answer is probably very little. What becomes more important to Avner than the success of his mission is the safety of his wife and child, whom he moves to Brooklyn in order to assure their safety. But as the mission progresses, and as it becomes more dangerous than anticipated, the Munich massacre and it's aftermath begin to haunt Avner's mind mercilessly.     What Spielberg is doing here, I think, is telling us that the conflict in the Middle East can not be solved through violence, because, as we learned last year from David Cronenburg's \\"A History of Violence,\\" violence begets violence. He is probably saying that violence can only temporarily solve the problem, but even more unrest can materialize on top of the previous layer of conflict. If men on both sides of the battle continue on with their actions, then nothing will be gained and nothing will be solved. The Middle East will remain in a bloody stalemate forever, Spielberg tells us.     He's probably right. Countless other regions of the world are experiencing violence and depravation: Ireland, India, Pakistan, and Africa to name a few. Spielberg uses the Munich incident as a backdrop for rational explanation. He isn't pointing fingers, making accusations, or blurting out criticisms, but is instead observing and utilizing as only a master storyteller can. He is also not looking for any answers. He's only reminding us of the harsh reality that some humans cannot live in peace, but must instead resort to violence in order to achieve personal gain.     And this still rings true today. Because we see these events through Avner's eyes, and because Bana plays him so well, we understand him as a human begin with human concerns instead of a gun-welding hero out for a kill. As \\"Munich\\" progresses towards it's ending, we realize that Avner is every human being on the planet characterized into one person. He wants answers to what is going on in the world and he isn't getting any. That's what makes the film so appropriate, and Spielberg makes the film appropriate by ending it with an image so haunting in it's surrealism that it speaks volumes on it's own. It also reminds us that sometimes the people standing on the sidelines can get hurled into the game.     Rated R; 166 minutes; Directed by Steven Spielberg
0812550706|4.0|Ender starts off as alittle boy. He is a third child which is not common. And there is a war going on between the buggars and the human beings. The army is looking at him cause there is a war about to be comming, and they need someone to lead the army. <br />He starts his training as a little boy and they make it really hard on him. They make it hard out with him through the hole story. The book is alittle boring at the begining but by the 5th chapter you will not stop reading it. It has many action scenes in it, as well as drama. The writer brings you into the book, And makes you want to read more about it.
039472903X|4.0|Who in the world of advertising doesn't know the name David Ogilvy? For that alone, I recommend this book as Necessary. It's so important for advertising and marketing professionals to learn from those who helped shape our industry and to continue expanding their knowledge base. Mr. Ogilvy's prose is entertaining and honest. Tooting his horn, he discusses successes with great pride, but he also is humble in sharing mistakes he's made. His book is all encompassing, covering so many aspects of the ad industry - even where to look for a job and the descriptions of each category. If you are looking for a text book on advertising, this isn't it. This book is more like sitting down with your mentor in a quiet restaurant with a glass of 20-year old scotch and reminiscing over his career.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|I'm a BIG fan of Robert Parker's earlier \\"Spenser\\" novels, so thought I would take a look at his \\"Jesse Stone\\" series.  The book on which this film is based is, in my opinion, only fair.  But Selleck made it into a very good, small/initimate detective/police procedural thriller.    (Ironically, in an interview included in the \\"Special Features\\" on the DVD, Selleck apologies to Parker fans for certain plot changes made in the movie.  In my opinion, these changes greatly improved the plot - and I say that as a Parker fan.)    Selleck seems to bring more and more authenticity and . . . well . . .gravitas . . . to each new role he tackles.  You see this in his Westerns, e.g., Quigley Down Under (which I also recommend).  Part of it is acting.    But if you know what to look for you can tell that Selleck knows his way around firearms and is not some Hollywood nitwit who would like as not shoot his foot off in Real Life.  I think this actual knowledge bleeds over into Selleck's film roles, and helps make him believable.    Bottom Line: \\"Stone Cold\\" is better than 95% of the bigger budget, \\"fantasy\\" cop films that are out there.  No explosions or car chases. Just a good story; good acting; and characters you care about.
B0007VZ91C|5.0|This music will wrap you in beauty.  This is my most favorite of Deva Premal's cds.  There are no translations of the mantras, as in her earlier cds, but the exquisite presentation and layered harmonies more than make up for that.  Definitely worth having for yoga, meditation, cleaning house, driving, calming children :) and centering one's self right smack dab in the middle of the fact that you are alive!
0553212478|5.0|I thought this would be a lurid gothic work of sensationalism, but it is actually a sensitive and touching story of alienation and the ambiguity of creating human life. Victor Frankenstein has the ultimate case of post-partum depression, recoiling instantly from his creation as an abominatin, and then spending the rest of the novel oscillating between hatred of it, and a sense of guilty responsibility for it. The story glosses over the movie-fodder details (for instance, casually noting that Victor has discovered the secret of bestowing life on inanimate material, but never really addressing that issue or narrative) and instead is a wholly psychological novel, and a very fine and sensitive one.
0143034901|5.0|After 265 reviews, I am sure, there is little I can add to help possible readers know why they should read this book.<br /><br />I read it for my book club here in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where The Shadow of the Wind [A Sombra do Vento] has been kept among best selling books since 2005.  Very few books achieve the 5 star vote by all 16 participants in my book club.  This was one of them.<br /><br />This is a fairy tale for adults, for booklovers, for those who believe books may have power over one's life.  It is also a marvelous dream, leading us to the confines of our collective unconscious.  Like Daniel Sempere -- our main character -- we are guided by Ferm&iacute;n Romero de Torres, a magic, funny and mercurial character, in the ways in and out of the real and the dream worlds. And this weaving into and out of reality is in itself fascinating.<br /><br />  Some reviewers have compared this book with Eco's The Name of the Rose; Marquez' One Hundred Years of Solitude; Byatt's Possession or even mentioned the magic realism of Cortazar.  I believe instead that what all these books have in common with Zafon's novel is that like The Shadow of the Wind they speak directly to our common literary education.  They remind us of images, values, feelings we absorbed as children, adolescents or young adults when we read the classics from Grimm's tales to Apuleius' The Golden Ass.  These books are the product of our Western European educational values. And souls.<br /><br />Zaf&oacute;n is particularly good at transmitting the mood of the era. Barcelona, the Barcelona we know today, dramatic, electric and full of life, appears gloomy and rainy, dark as all of Spain felt during Franco's regime.  He is also true to the gothic spirit, still present in Catalan culture today, [see Barcelona's archicture, for instance] and captures it well in the novel.<br /><br />I recommend this book with FIVE STARS.  This is a new great voice in literature and it brings with it an enthralling experience.ence.  <br /> <br />
0679422714|5.0|This work is an extraordinary biography of arguably the most evil man the world has ever known. Unlike Hitler and Stalin who at least were somewhat constrained by their respective ideologies, Chang and Halliday describe a man unencumbered with a conscience who under the veil of communism was obsessed with only two things: himself and power. In the process he sacrificed over 70 million Chinese lives to pursue his quest for global-dominance, and confessed to be willing to wipe out half the earth's population if necessary.<br /><br />A psychopath and gifted political tactician Mao poisoned everything he touched. Everyone in his family either died, committed suicide, went missing, or became insane. Out of political expediency he destroyed everyone who was ever loyal to him. In pursuit of his global fantasies he unleashed a reign of mind-twisting terror so severe he drove some Chinese towards cannibalism. This sheds some light in explaining present day Chinese culture's openness to eating animals like dogs and cats. Unbelievably Mao seriously considered replacing people's names with numbers as an easier method to track individuals.<br /><br />Chang and Halliday's book is a riveting page-turner describing previously unknown details about Mao's life, path to power and global political chess play. They also expose just how dangerously close the world came to armageddon because of Mao. There are lessons to learn in understanding how evil can metastasize and hijack ideological movements. This book isn't just for people interested in learning about history's all-time greatest bad-guy. Because the book traces Mao's political machinations throughout his long life, this should be recommended reading for business students and professionals as there are similarities to the power plays that can take place within business and government.
B000002GBJ|5.0|A cd filled with all instrumentals often times can get boring to me, but not this one.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  Mr. Wakeman has enough creative and composition skills to put together an album that not only is thematically cohesive, but does not wear on the ear.  There's real music here, not just notes strung together.  Well done Mr. Wakeman, and I highly recommend this cd to anyone.
B00097DX3U|5.0|Out of Exile is great in different ways than Audioslave's first album.  Overall, the songs are more varied in their themes.  When I listen to the first album, I start feeling like most of  the songs are all about the same thing - like having an identity crisis and having a hard time with your personal relationships...  Don't get me wrong - I still love the album! <br /> <br />Out of Exile has some nice existential, political, desperate love, redemption, selfishness, craziness themes.  I think the great mix of songs reflect how the band is maturing together. <br /> <br />Tom Morello's guitar work is refreshing amid all the unoriginal crap out there.  It compliments Chris Cornell's great songwriting and soulful voice.  Timmy C and Brad Wilk are great too and provide the perfect backdrop. <br /> <br />My favorite songs are Doesn't Remind Me (I liked it from the moment they played it at a show before the album was even released - the beat and lyrics are just so catchy/hypnotic), #1 Zero (I love the range in this song - Morello takes off with a great guitar solo and Cornell goes sky high with his wailing), Be Yourself (I love Morello's work here too - I would love it acoustic too if they played it that way in the future) Man or Animal (probably the heaviest song on the album - the beginning is cool), Out of Exile (the lyrics are very personal to Cornell - it's kinda a tribute to how his wife & baby pulled him out of depression) Heaven's Dead (painfully sad - probably great acoustically too) and Your Time Has Come (it's a good song with political undertones - I think this is the most RATM kinda song on the album in terms of the theme). <br /> <br />If you're a Audioslave fan I would recommend getting the Live in Cuba DVD - it has great footage of the band in Havana and the concert is awesome.  It also has a bonus CD with five raw tracks straight out of the studio.
0679746048|3.0|This is one extremely rare case where I found, initially, that I enjoyed the movie better than the book. I'm realizing that this is due to the same glitch in my head that demands that art \\"look like something.\\" The movie had definate characters, a definate plot, foreward movement, a climax, a resolution.... in other words, a definable beginning, middle, and end. The book didn't have that -- it was a memoir of time in a mental hospital, conducted in disjointed memories and facts learned during that time spent in the hospital, or about the time. <br /> <br />The \\"supporting characters\\" -- ie, the girls on her ward -- were rather washed-out and seemed there purely as backdrop, rather than as people in their own right. <br /> <br />Worth reading to compare to the movie, and worth reading on it's own just for the sake of the fluid, poetry-style writing (now so popular in books like The House on Mango Street) and the incredibly vivid descriptions of the half-madness that Susanna suffered. <br /> <br />What struck me most was near the end, when she described exactly what a \\"wrist-banger\\" is -- and why she felt the compulsion to hurt herself. Having several self-inflicted scars myself, it warmed me to the character considerably.
B00006JDVV|5.0|Comic book-like characters. Realistic settings. Also, a history of dragons from the realistic point of view. The effects were crazy-cool. It's all a matter of how badly do you wanna see action? This movie answers the 'I wanna see action really bad' thirst. Tough men, fighting wars with dragons, areial wars, flight wars, ground wars, underground wars, the whole package. You''l love every second of it. Enjoy!
B00005JO1R|4.0|I'm beginning to get discouraged by a trend in DVDs: 1 disc and 2 disc \\"Special Collectors\\" editions coming out at the same time.  Walk THE LINE 2 disc edition gave me the same reaction as the LORD OF WAR 2 disc, which was after I watched everything: \\"That's it!?\\"... For example, on WTL there is an 11 minute 'featurette' on Cash's concert in Folsom Prison in 1968 and various recollections from Prison employees and his country singer friends.  What pictures do they show during all this? Scenes and photos from the movie! The actors portraying the real people. All the 'featurettes' are pretty much like that.  All these exclusive interviews that it mentions on the back of the DVD, these actors/musicians are barely in it, so somewhere there is more footage. If they are going to have something on the REAL Johnny Cash, why do they have to show the actors and not photos of the REAL Man in Black? Or interview/concert footage with the real Johnny Cash? How about throwing in the video for \\"Hurt\\"? or a documentary about the man.  Disc 2 is what I call \\"fluffy\\", which is to say there's not much substance.  I wish I would've bought the much cheaper 1 disc because I found very little usefull or informative with Disc 2.  As far as the movie: great. terrific.  Easily one of my favorite movies.  Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon were terrific and the singing was very good, particularily the song \\"Time's a Wasting\\", which curiously is not on the soundtrack CD.  The commentary by the director was good and it was nice to know that a majority of this movie is actually true.  The deleted scenes usually bore me on other movies, but these were pretty good and you'll catch John and June's real life Son(John Carter Cash) in a deleted scene as a disc jockey. I call this 'special collectors edition' the 2 disc Lazy movie makers and studios/quick price gouge DVD with mostly worthless special features edition. JARHEAD is coming out soon, and after WTL and LORD OF WAR(among others), I'm leary at the 2 different DVD versions on most movies now.  And while I'm at it, the extended versions of movies usually turn out dissapointing too.  It's not worth re-buying ANY movie with 5 extra minutes added into the movie and 'all new super duper' documentaries with everyone but the main actor of the movie.  Trendy trendy.at the 2 different DVD versions on most movies now.  And while I'm at it, the extended versions of movies usually turn out dissapointing too.

B000AGTPUA|5.0|Filled with magical settings and even more stunning visuals. It brings the story to life that was once a children's book by the same man who brought you Jumanji.

B000E1ZBGS|3.0|<br />Adaptations are always tricky since condensing a large 200-500+ page book can lead to liberties and many events taken out entirely. Another thing that can happen is filmmakers tend to be too nervous of altering anything that what worked in book format doesn't work as well on film. Hence we get Pride and Prejudice, which looks great, has respectable casting, but unfortunately has poor pacing and its 19th century-esque language. <br /> <br />The film centers around the Bennet sisters, most specifically Elizabeth(Lizzy) and Jane. They're all trying to get married, hopefully with someone with a big wallet. Jane ends up meeting someone named Mr. Bingley which takes an awful long time to resolve while Lizzy is in a love/hate mode with Mr. Darcy, a friend of Mr Bingley. The entire rest of the film follows the 2 women trying to get their respective men to marry them while the mom gets frantic about marrying them off. <br /> <br />One thing that tends to plague adaptations is trying to match the spirit of the novel a bit too closely without making it work in a film format. As such the book resembles the language from the book, incredibly long and dictionary-laden words are throughout the film, making me ask \\"isn't it better to just say 'I hate you' rather than that much words\\"? Same thing with the modern Romeo and Juliet film except this takes place in its proper time period and still seems odd hearing it. <br /> <br />Many actors and actresses seem to only have that in title only, as if they don't actually \\"act\\" they just do their job without doing much else. Usually they're girls with pretty faces where you watch them in a film and they don't really do much else that makes them memorable, they just read their lines. Look at Al Pacino in Godfather or Peter O' Toole in Lawrence of Arabia, perfect acting but making them transcend just lines on the page. The actresses here do their parts well, with a special nod of course to Keira Knightley who still has some awkwardness but is still capable of making a character believable. <br /> <br />It's a period piece so you're going to expect 2 things: beautifully shot and accurate costumes and of course we have both. Colorful sharp cinematography with 18th century style clothes make the film feel believable and accurate. The music also suits the film well, largely piano-based with some orchestration peppered throughout but not enough memorable themes to make me want to buy the soundtrack. <br /> <br />If you don't really feel like reading the novel, it's always best to check out this film although it's not exactly need to buy DVD material, unless you're a Jane Austen fan. <br />
0767805712|5.0|Imagine a world where we can genetically engineer perfect human beings. Human beings that can do tasks better than normal godly men and women. Now imagine that you want to be one of them to get that job. How far would you go? This man goes far. Too far. This movie is a fabulous sc-fi thriller of a man who wants his dream so bad that he's willing to do major identity fraud. There are so many beautifully crafted gizmos in here that it will make your mind boggle with tension. But there is also an underlining story of a man's passion and the need for acceptence. Enjoy!
B00005JO1R|5.0|The film is most likely going to get comparisons to Ray, the biopic about Ray Charles starring Oscar winner Jamie Foxx. That's unfortunate since personally I liked this film more. Granted you might find similarities with the films but only because the legend's lives just happened to go across similar paths. Ray to me would've fell apart if it wasn't for Jamie Foxx. Walk the Line meanwhile works with everything. <br /> <br />After a quick clip of Folsom Prison concert, the films opens with Johnny Cash as a youngin living at home with his brother and parents. Johnny(called J.R) is out fishing while his brother works with a saw. An accident happens and his brother dies which only confirms that his father doesn't think much of him. The film then jumps to Johnny in the Air Force as he's starting to write music. He eventually starts writing and gets some popularity but the important part is he met June Carter, a divorced mother of 2. Johnny gets impulsive about his feelings which she rejects while trying to help him with his addictions. <br /> <br />The film wins thanks to its 2 leads with Joaquin Phoenix pulling off a great portrayal of the Men in Black while Reese Witherspoon(who hasn't really done much well known dramatic work) brings a spunk to June. While you might listen to Ray's soundtrack which largely had Jamie Foxx lip synching, Joaquin and Reese did their own singing and while it's not dead on, it's quite impressive to hear them. Listening to \\"I Walk the Line\\" in the film was like wow, he's quite good. <br /> <br />In a way it's probably one of the better examples of a real-life love story. Not big goo-goo eyes with the occasional fight, this has heartbreak, pain, anguish and everything else that goes along with. Johnny goes through so much to win her back and just as far when she rejects him. Unlike Ray which had multiple wives, here it's the affections for one while trying to deal with a less-than-happy other. We end up liking it more rather than just \\"wife #3\\". <br /> <br />There's much to like about Walk the Line, from its performances to its rock music, it's a fascinating insight to a legend's life. <br />
B000BKVQTS|1.0|The plot is contorted, like my back after watching this film. The story bounces around, touching slightly, and wrongly, on several of the fairy tales that we all heard about. there were no moments of sheer excitement or raised bar. It was as low as filmmaking gets. Everything was out of order barely making comprehensive sense. It's jumbled. Even the jokes felt strained. It's not worth it. It really isn't worth it.

B00065HU9S|5.0|I liked this book better than Mystic River. I listened to the audio version and found it hard to stop listening. U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels and his new assistant Chuck Aule are sent to Shutter Island, a containment facility for the criminally insane off the coast of Massachusetts, after a patient escapes from a locked room. The oppressive air of the bleak facility hangs heavy over the island, and brings demons from Teddy's own past to the forefront of his mind.<br /><br />Teddy becomes convinced that the disappearance of the patient is part of something much bigger, some type of secret that is being kept by the guards and staff of Shutter Island. Chuck and he talk to the inmates, bunk down with the guards, try to unravel the meaning of a series of coded messages, and then get trapped on the island during a major storm. LeHane has written a deviously tight, gripping novel. Easily 5 stars!
B000A0GP4K|5.0|If you are a Bob Dylan fan don't miss \\"No Direction Home.\\"  Martin Scorsese does even a better job than he did with \\"The Last Waltz\\" about The Band.  Even if you're not a Dylan fan I think you'll like it.
0425166805|4.0|Well having just read \\"Chariots of the Gods\\", I realise how some people must completely rubbish it because of their beliefs, religion, education etc. But for me it is a logical question to ask \\"why is our history checkered with impossibilities and strange myths that seem to indicate a foreign presence with high technology?\\" I had already asked this question myself, so a book compiled of facts supporting the hypothesis of ancient \\"alien\\" encounters is a natural choice for me. It is quite outdated and presumptious but if you bear with it it may plant a seed of interest in you.

0553801503|2.0|Oh, how I long for the days when a fantasy did not require 15 books to be completed. Remember The Lord of the Rings? It was told in a mere 3 books and had more intellect than all of George Martin's and Robert Jordan's books combined. <br /> <br />I'm sorry, George, but I'm afraid I'm going to give up on you much like I gave up on Robert Jordan at Book 10 of the Wheel of Time. I just don't have the patience for 400 page books with a  storyline moving at a pace slightly slower than a snail.

B0006399FS|5.0|I must say that U2's career closely parallels that of human life itself: the birth and newness ('Boy'), cutting teeth ('October'), learning to walk, unsteady but with purpose ('War'), spiritual awakening ('Unforgettable Fire'), coming of age ('Joshua Tree'), knowing it all yet knowing nothing ('Rattle and Hum'), maturation and exploration ('Actung'), experimentation ('Zooropa'), ambition, sexuality, and drive ('Pop'), midlife crisis ('ATYCLB') and finally realization and rebirth ('HTBAAB'). This most recent effort sparkles with some of the best U2 material to date. 'Vertigo' opens the album with pure rock urgency that was missing on the prior album. The anthemic 'City of Blinding Lights' carries the Edge's trademark reverb guitar intro into a driving, soaring chorus. 'Sometimes you Can't Make it on Your Own' is more subtle yet just as powerful as the prior hit 'One.' 'Love and Peace' provides the album with aplomb and swagger and is a nice aural turning point. The raucous, stomping melody of 'All Because of You' contrasts nicely with the yearning of 'A Man and a Woman.' 'Original of the Species' is perhaps the strongest track on the entire album, which closes out with 'Yahweah,' a spiritual heart-on-your-sleeve afterthought. This, along with the weaker track 'Miracle Drug' still can't retard this virtual musical rebirth and one of the best u2 albums in years.
B00004TH83|5.0|I was so impressed with the amazing Lara Fabian capabilities that I found out when she was performing live in North America and flew to Montreal to hear her concert...this woman not only can compose the most beautiful music, she delivers it with a passion and sincerity that I've never before..or since seen. If Sony were to spend ANY money promoting her talents, she would be far bigger a personality than Celine Dion or any contemporary artist. Maybe that's a good thing...most Americans can't really recognize talent unless they have it spoon fed to them. Want a real treat?...hunt down her other albums!
B000BP86OG|5.0|I love the album...they keep a great rock n' roll sound from their first album, and add in a bit more glam. <br /> <br />I don't know what's with the chorus in 'Knockers', but everything else kicks ass :)

B000CNESU8|5.0|Paddy Chayefsky's brilliant satire \\"Network\\" still resonates today. Why? Because we live in the tabloid news culture that Chayefsky so deftly and scathingly pokes fun at. This beautiful, rich looking transfer of this classic film makes the original DVD look like mincemeat by comparison--the image is clear, sharp with a surprisingly robust color scheme. 30 years on \\"Network\\" looks like it never left the air.<br /><br />What's different about this edition and most important are the extras included here. In addition to Sidney Lumet's thoughtful, insightful and trivia filled commentary track we get a separate disk full of extras. \\"The Making of 'Network'\\" a 6-part Anniversary Documentary\\" goes over every aspect of the production from genesis to the Academy Awards. We also see a vintage excerpt from an interview that Dinah Shore did with writer Paddy Chayefsky for her TV show \\"Dinah!\\". Chayefsky sadly died nearly twenty years ago of heart failure and isn't around to give us his two cents on the madness of Diana's world and how it swirls around us every day. \\"Private Screenings with Sidney Lumet\\" hosted by Robert Osborne is a pretty good discussion on the making of the film with the talented director. Lumet has directed so many classics (\\"Dog Day Afternoon\\", \\"Tootsie\\", \\"3 Days of the Condor\\") that it seems unfair to just devote one program to one of his films but it's well worth it. The original theatrical trailer is included as well but the DVD is worth it just for Lumet's commentary track and footage of Chayefsky discussing his script. Originally Chayefsky got MGM to finance \\"Network\\" as part of a lawsuit against the studio related to his scathing satire of the world of health \\"The Hospital\\". All I can say is that the settlement of a lawsuit never had a better outcome. We are richer for this marvelous movie.<br /><br />For those that haven't seen the film a brief summary is in order; Howard Beale (Peter Finch who won a posthumous Oscar for his work here)is on the way out. His ratings are weak and the network decides to pull him from the nightly newscast. Beale has a mental breakdown on TV telling viewers he's going to kill himself on TV in two weeks. The ratings sky rocket which inspires network entertainment executive Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway also an Oscar winner for her role as the cold, heartless seductress)to propose to the network head (Robert Duvall)that the network give Beale his own show where he can rant and rave.  Despite the objections of the head of the news division Max Schumacher (William Holden in a terrific and undervalued performance)UBS creates a media circus around Beale which features him ranting and raving (\\"I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore\\")along with a psychic and other less than news worthy events.Schumacher becomes involved with Christensen despite the fact that he objects everything that she represents.<br /><br />Finch, Dunaway and actress Beatrice Straight all won Oscars for the film as did Chayefsky for his brilliant screenplay. It's a rare example of Hollywood awarding a film its due based on the quality of the material. Seen as a writer's film (which would explain why Lumet didn't win for Best Director)it's an example of a great collaboration between a talented team working at the top of their game.  Surprisingly the film is still potent and relevent even today. This two disc set is well worth picking up for fans of the film.

Finch, Dunaway and actress Beatrice Straight all won Oscars for the film as did Chayefsky for his brilliant screenplay. It's a rare example of Hollywood awarding a film its due based on the quality of the material. Seen as a writer's film (which would explain why Lumet didn't win for Best Director)it's an example of a great collaboration between a talented team working at the top of their game.  Surprisingly the film is still potent and relevent even today. This two disc set is well worth picking up for fans of the film. Warner has done a marvelous job bringing Chayefsky and Lumet's brilliant satire to DVD with bells and whistles just in time to commemerate its 30th Anniversary as an Oscar winner.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I took the advice from my coworker to watch Firefly(the TV  series) before Serenity. I did, and i'm glad that I did. The characters, stories, and humor is very well writen and acted. Firefly was so good I felt my heart drop knowing that i'm watching my last episode of this awsome series. Serenity kinds of starts where FireFly ends.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I had high hopes for this adaptation, hoping that despite the choices in casting, it would be a film of superb visual quality at the very least.  I was amazingly disappointed.  Not only are the performances lack-luster, at best (the exception being Dame Judi Dench who is always remarkable), the costuming was dreadful.  Half of the time I was cringing over the clothing of the wrong time period, and the other half noting clothing that was far beneath the station of the characters. The Bennett girls, and Darcy, always looked a disheveled mess, and Mr. Bingley was the only one with the appropriate hairstyle.  Had the performances been strong, I could have forced myself to overlook these technical flaws. Unfortunately we are left with an Elizabeth Bennett who has no strength, a Darcy who just always seems angry and never changes, and no development of the other characters or their relationships to one another.  The director was, obviously, relying on a viewer who was so familiar with the novel all of the pieces could be filled in your head, rather than on screen.  Overall, don't waste your time, get the 1995 BBC version instead, and enjoy a long, lovely afternoon.
B000CPH9I4|5.0|For those of you that decide to listen beyond the pop songs the record companies like to promote, you'll find that The Corrs are best when performing live in acoustic and orchestral sets.  While I first discovered The Corrs throught their hit single Breathless, it was through their excellent live recordings, Unplugged and Live in Dublin, that I truly began to enjoy their music.  Home ranks highly among these two albums with it's heartfelt vocals and organic feel.  Even if you've never listened to traditional irish music, like I had never done before buying Home, the beautiful orchestral arrangements and vocals are enough to please the ears. <br /> <br />Personal highlights of the album: <br />Brid Og Ni Mhaille - Andrea delivers a soothing vocal performance to this irish piece (sung in gaelic).  Kudos to producer Mitchell Froom and arranger Fiachra Trench for a perfect accentuating orchestral accompaniment. <br /> <br />Dimming of the Day - Sharon's gentle voice laced with a slow, acoustic guitar creates a pure, longing aura that flows with the song's lyrics.  Like No Frontiers from Unplugged, this is one of the few songs Andrea does not sing lead. <br /> <br />Heart Like A Wheel - heartbreaking song both through it's lyrics and Andrea's perfect vocals.
B0000AFX64|4.0|Nostalgic.  It allowed me to remember the original series (which was first class then) and truly appreciate the current version (which is superior now).
B000E97X66|5.0|Bruce Springsteen is, to me, the ultimate rock 'n roll performer.  This concert is surely one of the great rock concerts captured on record.  Does it include Springsteen's absolute-best material?  Maybe so, maybe not (it does include \\"Thunder Road,\\" which is my favorite song of all time).  And surely, these aren't even the E Street Band's best performances...maybe not even their best recorded performances.  So what makes this record so good?<br /><br />Well, for one thing, it's Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band.  For another, it's his first trip to London.  For yet another...it's great rock 'n roll!  Try not to get caught up in the frenzy of \\"The E Street Shuffle,\\" the barely-restrained chaos of \\"Detroit Medley\\" and \\"Kitty's Back,\\" the adrenaline rush of \\"She's the One.\\"  These are all marvelous performances, one of the best singer/songwriters and his band tearing up the stage.  HAMMERSMITH ODEON, LONDON '75 is a great rock record...not-so-coincidentally, it's also a Bruce Springsteen record.  Buy it, enjoy it, love it...it's bound to become yet another Springsteen classic.
B000002H3E|5.0|This isn't as heavy as there album Tooth And Nail but it's almost as good and just as popular. The heavier Lightning Strikes, Til the Livin End, It's Not Love and Unchain the Night are and the more melodic In My Dreans, Will The Sun Rise and The Hunter are excellent too. The 2 ballads Jaded Heart and Slipping Away are excellent power ballads too. The whole band here performs just as well as they did on Tooth And Nail. If you like melodic rock, hair metal, classic rock, metal or good music in general than get this.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|I've seen few movies in the past few years that have offered as many delightful surprises as this one. Korean cinema has been winning great acclaim recently, and after watching this film, it's easy to see why. True, the theme of incest may be a little too heavy for some viewers, and I couldn't help but notice that the few people on Amazon who rated this movie low did it only for that reason. These people actually let a 'taboo topic' jade their views to the point where it overshadowed all the great points of this movie. Such a shame. This is not a movie that promotes or glorifies incest; it simply uses it as a backdrop for the story, and that's it. <br />So if you can get over that, then you should watch this movie, because it truly is one of the freshest movies I've seen in years. With superb acting, spectacular cinematography and a plot that is virtually impossible to predict, \\"Oldboy\\" is a movie that should not be missed.  <br />I can't say too much more without spoiling the story. So I'll just close by saying that if you want to see something different than the all-too-predictable fare that keeps coming out of Tinseltown, then give this one a try. If you do, I can practically guarantee that you won't be disappointed.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|To prevent becoming long winded, like some of my previous reviews have been, I'll just say that I've been a DT fan since When Dream and Day Unite. Simply put, I know their catalog like the back of my hand. <br /> <br />And let me say, this is the most coherent and polished I've heard DT sound probably ever. The songs make great musical sense, there isn't gratuitous soloing and the album's flow seems flawless with the exception of The Answer Lies Within, which I think should have been placed between Panic Attack and Never Enough.  <br /> <br />The album as a whole is much less complicated than much of their previous work, but I'm glad that DT has really seemed to realize on this record that it doesn't take instrumental pyrotechnics all over the place to show your skills. All of the band members get to show their stuff on this album while still keeping things in the context of the song's natural structure, and I was very pleased to hear this. All of the boys can play, and you can hear it just in how locked in they are at all times.  <br /> <br />And LaBrie sounds less annoying than usual. He's always been the weak link for me in DT, because although he's a good singer I have always felt he wasn't right for the band. But I was pleased with his work here. He's getting better. <br /> <br />All in all, this is DT's best work in a long while and is the excellent straightforward rock effort that Falling Into Infinity should have been. <br /> <br />All of the songs are highlights, I would say, but the ones that wow me every time are Root of All Evil, which has a brilliant spirally main riff, a killer chorus and a well placed musical cue alluding to the trilogy it is a part of; These Walls, which has open, ringing textures that remind me of a lot of Images And Words-era stuff; Panic Attack, which blisters the entire way through and has the band showing off some melodic ideas that are pretty refreshing and a change of pace for them; and, of course, Octavarium, which is their best long-form song since A Change of Seasons.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
B000002U9W|5.0|I bought this at HMV yesterday, and because of that, I own every Pink floyd album now! I was very impressed with this.<br /><br />1. Atom Hear Mother Suite: 10/10: Excellent experemental track. consists of  7 songs in one and is 23:50, a tad bit longer than \\"Echoes\\", which runs 23:27. weird though, but great.<br /><br />2. If...: 20/10 The best song on the album. Very great sound, plus, this song is by far my favorite Pink Floyd song yet.<br /><br />3. Summer '68: 10/10: Very great song, especially because it's one of the songs that truly defins Pink Floyd.<br /><br />4. Fat Old Sun: 7/10: don't kill me for saying this, but this is one of the Floyd songs that I consider \\"Not very Floyd-ish\\" because the Lyrics and other stuff sound like it was forged from a poetry book. Still kind of good, but definitly not floyd.<br /><br />5. Alan's Psychadelic Breakfes: 10/10: Great 4-song finale to a great album.<br /><br />Definitly get this album if you love Pink Floyd. Worth all the money. Then again, what Floyd album isn't?
1592402038|5.0|Lynne Truss is brilliant.  She's written a delightfully, fun, clever, and witty book about punctuation, and she's done it so well that even people who hated punctuation lessons in school will enjoy her book.  They will learn something, too. <br /> <br />The only negative thing I can say about it is that a handful of references were perhaps a PG-13, so I didn't hand it over to my kids to read.  Admittedly, I'm rather picky about these things. <br /> <br />However, I did read a good portion of it aloud to my family.  I couldn't help it.  Lynne is so witty that I'd be laughing out loud and the family would demand to know what was so funny.  I had no choice but to read it aloud, and we couldn't help but learn something about punctuation in the process.
B00005U152|1.0|I recall seeing this movie as a kid and loving it.  However, it looks very old-fashioned, is very stiff, very staged looking.  It's just kind of hokey. <br /> <br />A new \\"Hunchback\\" movie is needed.  I'm waiting for that one, maybe with Brad Pitt as the hunchback. <br /> <br />Best, <br /> <br />Film Guy
B00005B36H|5.0|i love tool. i love this album, it was my first tool cd. no regrets. now i almost have them all! tool helped pry open my third eye.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|Like \\"Ray\\" before \\"Walk The Line\\" is a fine piece of work, made so great by the superb singing and acting of Phoenix/Witherspoon.Just as Fox did such a wonderful job at potraying Ray Charles,Phoenix is equal to the task with Johnny Cash.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants a great story with even better acting.What more could you ask for in a movie.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|My husband and I love the Firth movie and just about every Austen film we've seen. Sadly, we found this remake a vulgar version of a truly gracious story.     The earthy, lust-filled movie left no reason for the bland, distant, dull father to even own the dusty books in his hovel library. There was no reason for this Darcy to choose THIS Elizabeth - no reason at all.     This movie was emptied - stripped - of all we love about Austen. Austen without the winsomeness of intellect; Austen without wisdom and compassion of good, ennobling character; Austen without highly refined interpersonal drama; Austen without the loveliness and intricacies we've grown to expect. Finally we laughed and laughed: this was Austen without Austen!     We would not recommend this to anyone. Save your money. Use your time for better things.
B00005OWIU|4.0|I had been looking for this score ever since I got into the \\"Harry Potter\\" craze a few years ago.  Next to John Williams's stellar score for \\"The Prisoner of Azkaban,\\" this is my favorite HP score. <br /> <br />What's magical about Williams's music here is how strongly it evokes the imagery from the film -- a fact that can be said about most of his music.  From the quiet opening of Prologue, to The Quidditch Match, and through to the end credits of Hedwig's Theme, we can relive the fun and excitement we experienced while watching the film. <br /> <br />I recommend this CD for any fan of the Harry Potter movies and John Williams's music.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Director:  Ridley Scott <br />Cast:  Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nelson, Oliver Reed, Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi, Djimon Hounsou. <br />Running Time:  155 minutes <br />Rated R for intense, graphic combat and some language. <br /> <br />The epic blockbuster returns with the 21st Century's answer to Cecil B DeMille, Ridley Scott (\\"Alien\\") and his dramatic tale of courage and revenge, \\"Gladiator\\", who is \\"the general who became a slave, the slave who became a gladiator, the gladiator who defied an emperor\\".  \\"Gladiator\\" chronicles the story of Maximus (played brilliantly by Oscar-winning Russell Crowe), General to frail Caesar Marcus Aurelius' Roman Army as well as a husband and father. After a victorious battle far from home, Caesar (Richard Harris) holds private court with Maximus to offer him his position after his passing. Overhearing this, Caesar's jealous and scheming son Commodus (a solid Joaquin Phoenix) guilts his father then murders him. Commodus plots to get rid of Maximus because of his lust for power and envy of his father's love for Maximus.  Maximus survives Commodus' henchmen's attack, is found near death only to be sold into slavery, loses his wife and son to murder by Commodus' minions, and becomes a very celebrated gladiator in the area.  Eventually, Maximus decides that he must kill Commodus, who is creeping along to the edge of insanity; however, Commodus thinks Maximus must die, as he believes Maximus is more popular than he.  The two enemies reveal to each other that their conflict can only resolved with a fight to the death. <br /> <br />With a budget of over $100 million, Scott certainly delivers the goods. \\"Gladiator\\" transcends the notion of \\"blockbuster\\" that we have become accustomed to in the age of electronic and special effects wizardry and instead offers a good old fashioned action film along the lines of Spartacus and Ben-Hur.  Not only are we drawn into an archetypal story that contains all the classic elements a filmgoer could dream of (love, loss, courage, despair, good triumphing over evil etc), but also on offer is a visual feast of cinematic painting after painting; a rich tapestry of images that are breathtaking and ultimately visually satisfying. From the plains of Germania, to the desert stronghold of Zuchobar, and finally to great Rome herself, John Mathiesion, the cinematographer is to be commended highly for his general inventiveness and ability to capture so much on film. The opening battle scene is superb as a cast of thousands erupt across the screen and provide an indication that we are about to see a film that pays incredible attention to detail throughout its entirety. In every way, Scott has created a world for us that scuttles films of similar epic undertakings (and budgets!) and sends them to their dooms at the bottom of the murky depths of film history where they belong. <br /> <br />The cast is generally very strong. Crowe proves himself very suitable to the task with a great emotional range and depth of character. His accent occasionally may occasionally annoy, but this aside, he was well and truly up to the billing. Phoenix is also excellent as the disturbed Commodus, as is Connie Nielson as Lucilla, the daughter of Marcus who \\"should have been a son\\" and finds herself torn between loyalty to her brother and doing what is 'right'. The old guards of Harris, Reed and Jacobi (Grachus) are uniformly strong as supporting characters, and Spencer Treat Clark (Lucius) does a fine job as the young heir to the throne.  So apart from the spellbinding acting, scarily realistic fight scenes and the amazing script, what else can we look for? The music is just stunning, its exactly what we need brought in at exactly the right time, truly wonderful directing. And then we have the stunning special effects, we can really visualize the greatness that is Rome, the fight scenes really make you believe.  A visually exhilarating masterpiece that is not only one of the biggest motion-picture spectacles of the decade, yet considered to be one of the most powerful as well.
B00007KQA3|5.0|Yeah, a masterpiece. As noted by many, 1984 is a brilliant screen adaptation of a seminal text. Most impressive is its incisive attention to detail (the film exhibits some of most masterfully created sets and costuming ever - Winston's coveralls say it all - soundtrack, editing, et al.). Further, the film is devoutly faithful to its terrifyingly prescient source. No paltry feat. Further, the acting is not merely uniformly excellent, but notable.  Richard Burton's swan song performance as O'Brien was worthy of a posthumous Oscar - capturing the duplicitous depths - and Hurt is perfectly cast as Winston.<br />Well, then?  How many people actually have seen the film - which - in my opinion was the best of the crop that year (I actually saw it within weeks of its release in Los Angeles on the big screen, on an evening where it played to a half-empty theatre). I thought it was great.  But then, again, I voted against Reagan.<br />I was amazed how short 1984's actual run in the theatres was.  The loud and brassy Terminator was a much bigger hit.  I am as yet amazed at the overwhelming price tag on the DVD. But . . . I am since better educated. No mistake why the film was made in 1984 . . . it simply happened to coincide with the period when John Poindexter and other extremists in the American intelligence community were laying the foundations for the controversial programs of the NSA and CIA as they are today.  My claim is that the film has been supressed - on the assumption that most Americans who haven't read the book - and actually, unfortunately that is most - won't.<br />But, none should feel deprived - we're experiencing the whole story right now.
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|Director:  Paul Greengrass <br />Cast:  Matt Damon, Franka Potente, Brian Cox, Julia Stiles, Karl Urban, Gabriel Mann, Joan Allen, Marton Csokas, Tom Gallop, John Bedford Lloyd. <br />Running Time:  109 minutes <br />Rated PG-13 for violence and intense action, and for brief language. <br /> <br />Unearthing decent spy movies in this post-cold war epoch often resemble a wild goose chase, with true gems few and far between. The \\"Bourne\\" franchise came to us back in 2002, vying for attention against the tepid likes of a re-incarnated Jack Ryan in \\"The Sum of All Fears\\". Starring Matt Damon, Bourne won hands down with its enjoyable romp of cross-European, high-tech escapades. Combining a reasonably gripping story with sufficient quotas of CGI-free excitement, \\"The Bourne Identity\\" filled a long deserted niche for many film buffs, and while it didn't exactly conjure the good old KGB vs. Everybody days, it nonetheless heralded a comeback for previously prominent big screen values.  In the first \\"Bourne\\" foray, Damon played super agent Jason Bourne, suffering from amnesia and struggling to find out who the hell operated him in the first place. Amid several well-crafted action segments and car chases, the movie depicted Bourne's stand against a shadowy covert conspiracy bent on keeping hidden from prying eyes and vindictive ex-operatives with too much time and gadgets on their hands. The sequel begins more or less where the first chapter left off. A liberated Bourne and his prequel-originated love interest Marie (Franke Potente) elope to exotic Goa beaches in India, eking out a bucolic existence there away from hapless intelligence agencies and brainwashed assassins.  But idyllic conditions like those were never meant to last, and Bourne's infamy soon catches up with him, at Marie's grisly expense. Turns out a new secret agenda has risen to the fore, threatening to entangle our reluctant master spy. A pissed off Bourne therefore ventures to locate those responsible for Marie buying the farm, as well as clear his own name. <br /> <br />While just as thrilling as its senior, \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" reveals a major flaw even in the moniker given it: Matt Damon's indefatigable protagonist simply has too many moves, abilities, and lives for his own good. Believability aside, at some point the agent's uncanny expertise begins to grate, not gelling at all with his supposed cluelessness and so-called desperate situation. Would you be desperate if you had a seemingly endless supply of cash of every denomination, nine passports, and ready made weapons that materialize out of thin air?  To fluff up \\"Supremacy\\"s plot and distinguish it from \\"Identity\\", the newer flick features increased complexity and multiple conflicts in need of resolution, thus paving the way for additional episodes, should the need be felt. Bourne presently faces ghosts harking back to his former employers, Treadstone, plus a few new ones courtesy of that by-now obligatory action movie stalwart, the Russian mafia. The ever-menacing Brian Cox (\\"The Ring\\", \\"X2\\", \\"Troy\\") returns as a suspiciously uncooperative would-be ally, tagging along for the ride while CIA chief Landry (Joan Allen) tries to organize a legitimate search for the missing renegade professional. Karl Urban (\\"The Chronicles of Riddick\\", \\"The Lord of the Rings\\") adds intimidation via a calculating Russian hit-man, and Julia Stiles contributes selected pouty facial expressions, minimally augmenting Supremacy's lineage and ties to its cinematic forebear.  But all of these characters can't mask the movie's slightly more-of-the-same feel. Despite an astonishingly accomplished car chase through Moscow in a puzzlingly sturdy old taxi, impressive shots of Berlin and pervasively consistent levels of suspense, overall impressions lead us to conclude \\"Supremacy\\" fails to surpass the first outing, resulting in superfluous baggage of the infuriatingly addictive variety. Expectations for whatever comes next in the action series, presumably Ludlum's Bourne \\"Ultimatum\\", should be kept to moderate thresholds of feasibility. Do not anticipate something bombastic or marvelously ground-breaking, but certainly look forward to more capable antics from the indestructible Damon and his box office panache.

What were you THINKING Steven?<br /><br />That's the beauty of owning this concert as an audio-only;  You won't have to see the lost-in-the-seventies fashion disasters. You'll just enjoy the killer performance of a young, hungry band out to prove something.

B0000029LG|3.0|The first disc of HISTORY is worthwhile. It features 15 of Michael Jackson's biggest hits, including Billie Jean, Rock With You, Don't Stop Til You Get Enough, The Way You Make Me Feel, Black or White, and more. The second disc is a collection of 15 new songs. Unfortunately, it is spotty at best. There are some great songs here. Notably \\"Scream\\" (duet with sister Janet Jackson), Stranger In Moscow, They Don't Care About Us, etc. The rest of them fall between being overly sappy (You Are Not Alone, Childhood, HIStory, Smile) to very bitter sounding (Tabloid Junkie, D.S.). Luckily they released disc one on its own, so you can get all the hits, without the waste of a second cd.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This is now my FAVORITE movie. I have watched all the Jane Austen movies, as well as many other movies like them, and so was looking for more when I saw this one recommended here at Amazon. Even my husband and my seventeen year old nephew really enjoyed this movie. The acting, writing, music, etc. is so well done. The ending is so romantic. You (men & woman)will LOVE this movie.
B0000524CY|4.0|This movie lasts 2hrs and 18mins, but only since the 62mins of movie it starts being scary and cool. The first hour of the movie is very boring, and personally, I've watched it only once, and as I already know what happens there, I start watching since the minute 62 of the movie. For me, this movie nly lasts 78 mins.<br /><br />Now, It's one of the movies that have scaried me more in my whole life, and for me, it's the best \\"Exorcist\\" movie from all those out there.<br /><br />It's an almost perfect movie, because of the reasons I just wrote, and that's why I rate it 4/5. But, as it costs only 10 bucks, it totally worth it.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|Having read all of the reviews online,I was hesitant about buying the movie.I have had the pleasure of seeing the show in New York with the original cast,as well as 2 touring companies.I guess I can consider myself a fan.I was very surprised at how well the stage story transfered to the screen.Yes, some of the dialouge that was sung in the stage show,but not in the movie,got on my nerves. Over all I was amazed and moved by the movie.For anyone who is even a casula fan of the show needs to see,and buy this movie.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|I enjoyed this film but it's not as good as everyone was saying it was. The film is good and at times the film is great but at times you want more with the film. The film is about Johnny Cash and his love for June Carter but that's about it. I found there could of been more of a story then there was. the acting is good from Joaquin Phoenix who doserves his oscar nod and he might win,  Reese Witherspoon shines (she shines in everything) and she might win an oscar too (I found soem of the other actress in the catoagory better then her). Overall the film is good and I recomand it you will be mesmerized at times through the film.
B000301YY8|4.0|This was not a bad album at all. The guitar and vocals are absolutly wonderful, though some of the songs on this album are quite boring. I love the second song on this album, as well as the third and fifth song(s). I recomend this album.

B000002B35|3.0|I heard a lot about this record from the reviews here online & so i thought i'd get this album. I'm not a big fan of live albums as i always find that they rarely live up to their studio counterparts, the other thing i dont like about live records is that most of them sound exactly like the studio atempts. Pulse is guilty on both of these counts. <br /> It is not a bad effort, though i'd only recomend it to die hard PF fans & those who have got all their other albums (exept Atom Heart Mother, which is a disgrace).  <br />I've heard quite a few people moan about the exessive crowd noise on this recording, i don't know what all these people are on, it's a \\"Live Album\\" for crying out loud !!!! <br />Of all the songs on this collecton i think the ones off the \\"Division Bell\\" work the best here. I got this one on sale so i feel 11 is just about right for the double album. it probably won't get as much play time as say \\"Animals\\" but it's good to add it to my collection of Pink Floyd records.....
B0009R1T7M|3.0|I think my expectations were too high.  And no way should this have been an album of the year as other reviewers have stated.  I do think he is talented, and the cd itself is better than 90% of the garbage that is out there today, but it kinda grated on my nerves after a while.  Was it too long?  Did it have too many layers?  I can't really pinpoint it...and I'm also hoping that it will grow on me. <br /> <br />I do recommend giving it a try, if only to expand one's exposure to something different.
0977326403|5.0|I have read the original Good to Great book, and was waiting for more books following that one. I read this short monograph expecting to learn something more about the non-profit organization. It was a pleasant delight! This monograph first reviews the basic pricinples of the original book, and then expand into areas specific to the non-profit organization, such as how to do performance evaluation without financial numbers. Examples include hospital, education district anbd others. The anecdotes in the book are helpful, and practical. I would recommend this monograph for both as a quick review of the original book and as suggestions how to measure the non-profit sector.
B00006LFGD|5.0|Duets! Wonderful duets. A few of my favorite singers have Duet Albums out...Frank Sinatra and Barbra. I gave the CD a 5 stars. I have many favorites on it and two new ones. Look at the artist!! How could you not want this CD?? You cannot go wrong with Josh Groban and Babs. A timeless song by Neil Diamond and her, \\"You Don't Bring Me Flowers\\"... Barry Gibb \\"Guilty\\"...\\"What Kind  of Fool\\"...and Don Johnson, better than you think. Barry Manilow...they are great together, better than I thought they would be. A real oldie treasure with Judy Garland. Remember Babs on Judy's show?<br /><br />Celine Dion sing their equally shared duet \\"Tell Him\\" You have Ray Charles...Donna Summer \\"Enough is Enough\\"...Kris Krisofferson,Kim Carnes.

0761129235|4.0|this is quite a brilliant way of approaching things, so helpful, especially when feeling stuck in any aspect of your life.  the basic idea is the thing:  \\"a journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step\\"  yada, yada . this book does inspire on the basic point. <br />i heartily recommend taking the small step of reading this book.
B00004RF9B|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Have not seen it in years but the whole story came back to me pretty quickly. <br />I watched this with my 6 year old and he enjoyed it too. I think \\"Robbie the Robot\\" was probably the precurser to Lost in Space's \\"Robot\\". <br />I highly recommend this sci-fi classic.
B000025SJ8|3.0|This is the most over hyped albums ever. Look at the reviews, even the ones that praise him they all talk about how subpar ever thing is, (bass, guitar, and vocals)they just sa how intense it is. ALL HYPE! In a vein atempt to harden his ego he \\"DID EVERY THING HIMSELF, exccept for some bass tracks nobody mentions. Lyrics so-so (EGO), guitar so-so (EGO) bass,(he did everthing else himself but some bass tracks that you don't even hear), the drums, yep, \\"drums\\" (EGO)(he hired a basses, the easiest thing in the world, not that you hear it, he should of hired a drummer)(EGO)Its not bad, its just not great.What he really needed to do was hire a drummer! He's worse than a 15 year so. cal. wannabe punk. He uses the same voice distortion that they use on MAYHEM's much better, more intence and just better DEATHCRUSH! Only for fans of orginal Norwegian darkness (if only to understand how vargs ego, no talent, and self hype can destoy, but make more important, the real idealists!) DEATH TO VARG! LONG LIVE DEAD! LONG LIVE EURONYMOUS! LONG LIVE MAYHEM! THE TRUE ORIGINATORS OF THE NOTHERN DARKNESS!
B00005KARK|5.0|This is such a nice Disney movie.  The tenderness between mother and child is so sweet and the song Baby Of Mine is charming.  I have seen this movie several times beginning when it first appeared many years ago and am so glad to now own it so I can watch it whenever I want.  One that should be in most people's collection.
0380789019|5.0|As a budding Neil Gaiman fan, I thought I should pick up Neverwhere as my intro to his adult novels. I'd read Coraline and his other \\"children's\\" books but none of his novels. From the moment I read the first page I was addicted, the characters are so real, and you genuinely cared what happened to them from beginning to end. His perfect blend of dark and light, fused into modern society with his unique look at London life. I loved it!
B000002P5R|5.0|This is a tough CD to rate.  After all the drugs and the wild hedonistic adventure that helped define his early career, the real Jimi Hendrix begins to emerge right here.  On this release we find that Jimi's thrown off the psychedlic \\"clown\\" persona (that the black community hated so much) and his true nature a starts to emerge.  I love all the early music but part of Jimi's overall image was packaging and marketing.  The marketing and packaging inevitably found its way into the earlier productions (1st and 2nd releases)at varying degrees.  While that was all great fun, you find none of that here.  Jimi had crashed through the mirror and an entirely new artist was emerging.  Here we find the first rays of Jimi's new rising sun.<br /><br />Evidently some reviewers can't get their heads around what I'm saying here so let me try to paraphrase it.  Hendrix was brilliant, innovative and the most important force in rock/pop music ever to appear.  His first two records were Chas Chandler productions and Chas even helped with the writing.  There was some very deliberate marketing that played to Jimi's wild nature.  Four years later Jimi was tiring off all that, in fact he really didn't even enjoy public playing all that much.  The First Rays... release reveals the real Jimi Hendrix emerging from his marketed image.  I'm not slamming his first three releases, on the contrary - I love 'em all!  Electric Ladyland is the most played CD in my entire collection and I've owned a copy in one form or another since 1969!<br /><br />As a 14 year-old guitarist and music lover I was devestated when I heard the sad news that Jimi had died.  In fact, it still hurts a little bit even today.  The tunes on this CD represent the best of the work Jimi had in the can for his follow-up to Electric Ladyland when he left us.  A lot of the work was created in his new Electric Lady studio in Greenwich Village.  Some of the tunes are pieces Jimi personally finished and others were polished up or refined for release by Mitch Mitchell and Eddie Kramer a couple of months after he died.  It must have been very hard for these two men to go into the studio and work on these songs.  I recall purchasing The Cry of Love and crying when I first heard \\"Drifting\\".  I also purchased Rainbow Bridge on vinyl, I never bothered with War Heroes, by the time we got that release I'd moved on to King Crimson.  One great track missing here that was on Rainbow Bridge is Hear My Train A'comin.  First Rays of the New Rising Sun includes everything from The Cry of Love and most of Rainbow Bridge.  There are also tunes from War Heroes.<br /><br />This release is very different from Jimi's earlier work.  The song writing is far more structured, the lyrics more meaningful and mature, and there really isn't any \\"stretching out\\" with his solos (that's good for showing off the song writing but bad for us folks who loved to hear Jimi wail and wail and wail... ) Once again he was effectively using the studio itself as an instrument, the songs are built up over many layers.  In some tunes he sounds spiritually tired (Drifting) and exhausted but the work is still great.  One or two tracks seem a bit \\"unpolished,\\" I've never been a huge fan of \\"Hey Baby\\".  I always thought the words sounded a bit \\"off the cuff\\".<br /><br />Out of all the tunes I'd say that In From the Storm, Izabella, Room Full of Mirrors, Dolly Dagger, Night Bird, and Freedom are the high points.  The entire CD is very good, there are no \\"dud\\" tracks, but this CD also has a very different feel than Jimi's earlier works - he sounds all grown up on this release.<br /><br />Round out your collection of Jimi's work and buy this one and if you want to get an idea of where Jimi may have been heading I recommend Miles Davis's Agharta and/or Pangea.by Mitch Mitchell and Eddie Kramer a couple of months after he died.

0316236446|5.0|Our whole family loves this book. It is nice because it is simple enough for a four year old and can evolve into making your own world at any age. The drawings are neat and very clear about the steps. I promise you won't be sorry. Get a big peice of paper and have the whole family join in on making their own world!
B000002UA7|2.0|that this great music sounds so awful on this CD. <br /> <br />I wanted an introduction to Kate Bush's music, and this CD seemed a very good way to start.  When I put it on, I couldn't believe how muffled and dull it sounded.  I could swear I'm listening to the music through a wall of cotton. <br /> <br />I went to the existing reviews here on Amazon, and, sure enough, Ferrara Brain Pan's spot-on review stated exactly what I was feeling upon listening to these recordings. <br /> <br />It is inexcusable that an artist of Bush's stature is represented in such poor technical fashion - and a shame, considering how good the songs are. <br /> <br />Another little beef is that the CD clocks in at under 49 minutes - in other words, there's room for 30 more minutes of music, which I'm certain could have been well-used, considering the vastness of her catalogue. <br /> <br />I will be looking for the remastered individual albums, but if I didn't know how good Kate Bush was outside of the context provided by this butchered collection, I wouldn't bother buying any more of her material. <br /> <br />Shame on EMI for allowing this.  I give it two stars (instead of one) simply because the music is so very good.
B0000AUHPK|5.0|I must say I was completely surprised by this magnificent film.  I had seen other versions and even wrote a review I felt so strongly about the Timothy Dalton portrayal.  However, nothing really matches this rendition and Ralph Fiennes is absolutely Heathcliff.  You feel the pain, anger, hate, and obsessive love with every scene in this film and it truly follows the book more closely than any other version I have seen. Like I said in the past, this used to be my least favorite of the classics.  Now I must confess I believe it is my favorite.  I love this tragic love story and believe the Fiennes/Binoche performances exceed all others.  You become totally immersed in Heathcliff's suffering and his need to strike out at all who have hurt and abused him and kept him pushed down so that there was never any hope of his obtaining a position that would allow him to marry Cathy.  One of the strange things about this story to me is that Heathcliff is the bad guy throughout but I notice that his actions are really reactions to others' cruelty to him.  At least this seems true up to the time he is a young man at which point his major abusive behavior kicks in.  And, Cathy is always pointing out his ill-kempt appearance, seemingly forgetting that he is forced to live in the stables and has one set of rags to wear.  This is a part of this story that has always irritated me about Cathy and her taunting behavior and lack of compassion for his predicament.  Anyway, you must do yourself a big favor and get this movie.  You will not be disappointed believe me, and you wll find yourself choosing to watch this over and over again.  And, one other important thing: no matter how difficult it is to like some of these characters, they all reach your heart in some way at some time in this film.  Be sure to be prepared for a good cry when you decide to watch this film. <br />
B00000F169|3.0|I was drawn to this movie after perusing through some of the John Carpenter movie lists here on Amazon. The customer reviews tended to be generally positive so I figured I'd give it a try.<br /><br />There were many parts of this movie which were laugh-out-loud funny and there were others which were almost painful to watch. There were parts of the \\"alien\\" sequence which were completely hilarious but I felt that the whole sequence was about 5 min too long.<br /><br />As long as the viewer can ignore the gaping plot holes and the no-budget wardrobe doesn't detract too much, this movie can be enjoyed for what it was - a student film by a future master of the genre (sci-fi, horror, suspense).<br /><br />There were parts of this film that can be recognized in more modern films with much larger budgets (the light-speed sequence for one - eat your heart out G Lucas LOL).<br /><br />Buy this one if only to complete your Carpenter library but rent it with one of your buddies and a few beers to enjoy this brief glimpse into the formative mind of John Carpenter.
0307276902|2.0|A Million Little Pieces by John Frey <br /> <br />Review by Christen Buckley <br /> <br /> A book of much controversy, A Million Little Pieces has inspired horror, inspiration and self redemption throughout the world. Set in the rural Midwest at a Drug and Alcohol rehab facility, A Million Little pieces examines the harshness of withdrawal and the feel and reasoning of addiction through the eyes of young James.  <br />Impertinently stubborn, James is prone to resisting the typical treatment, which usually requires a religious course or faith in a Higher being. James however, chooses his own ways to deal with his guilt ridden past and daily retching as his body's addiction fights for his mind. \\"One second I want to cry, one second I want to kill, one second I want to die.\\" (pg 33).  As James grows throughout the story, recalling hurtful memories allow him to come to terms with his future and his life. <br />Among the drug addict, killers and criminals, James find hope, friendship and love that can only be shared by those who have undergone similar experiences \\"Things I love with People I love. It was almost perfect. Almost. I miss Lilly.\\" (pg381) Leonard, a mob boss, becomes James's father figure and trusted friend. Miles, James's roommate is a kind, influential judge, proving useful to James. Lilly, a beautiful crack addict, teaches James to love again and forgive himself of the past.  These people along with the work of the clinics employees, Joanne, Hank and Lincoln help James to rebuild his life though he first resents their practices with the fiery passion of his indescribable \\"Fury\\". <br />Though renowned for its vivid detail, I found the book lacking; the cause of this opinion is unknown. The style was creative and interesting, following continuing grammatical errors. James, whether a fictional or real character simply annoyed me to great extent, though his will and stubbornness was admirable. Regardless of whether I enjoyed the personality of the main character, or if every event actually happened, this book  provides insight into the world of addiction in a explicit way that one can never forget\\"You saved your own Life...Remember to have dignity... and hold on\\"(pg 391). <br />
6305428298|5.0|This is a movie NOT to be missed. Jane Horrocks is absolutely amazing (as she is in Life is Sweet). Perfect casting all around.
B000AYEIZY|5.0|Saw the special on PBS, two different nights, in bits and pieces. Intrigued me solely on the fact that this super group was back together. Got the DVD for Christmas and it has not left the player. I started as most would, selecting my favorites, at first, then watched the whole thing. Wow! Minor miscues, but not enough to make one complain. Clapton soars. Bruce boogies. Baker is still very, very good! Supreme visual quality, very well produced, tremendous song line-up. This DVD rocks!
B00004XONN|1.0|I detest Radiohead with a passion.  This group was so bad that Capitol finally DROPPED them!  Now, they have no label to turn to, even though they're working on a new album.  \\"Kid A\\" is overrated.  Get the \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" soundtrack instead.
B000E1155E|1.0|Anyway, this CD is overrated.  Avoid this, and avoid any reviewer who names himself after dead rock stars.  They can't be trusted.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|Some may think that it's kinda wierd that a teenager like myself would avidly listen to Hendrix, but who can't love him? He is probably my main guitar hero. Where would rock and roll be without his ingenuity? It would be where the Beatles were when they broke up; guitars would only be a secondary part of the music. Jimi brought screaming guitar solos into the norm for rock and roll, and his name be praised for it. Buy this CD, whether or not you've even heard Hendrix; a must MUST have for rockers and bluesmen.
0688170528|2.0|I like Picoult for her ideas much more than I like her execution. Once again, just a little disappointing.  <br /> <br />I didn't dislike the characters; I just felt I never really got to know them. In the same way that Emily feels people only want to know the outside Emily, the surface level, and what was expected of her, it seems that's all we're really shown- and then we're  expected to believe there's more.  <br /> <br />Other areas were puzzling. I disagree with other posters who've written that Chris would have never killed Emily. This is teenage love- it doesn't make sense- but it could happen. However, I felt the concept of cradle-to-high school love was just slammed down our throats the entire time, to the point where it was repetitive and annoying, not romantic (this, coming from someone who has known her husband since grade school). The most puzzling area (and missed opportunity) was that Emily's depression was never fully explored, which I think would have made the book much more compelling. Instead, Picoult wants to keep us guessing, so  the signs of Emily's depression are skimmed over, and we're not really allowed to see the evolution of it or have it fleshed out with any kind of depth. <br /> <br />Chris' love for her was sweet and her feeling overwhelmed by her whole life being mapped out before it'd begun was intriguing, but for some reason these two elements just didn't add up to a whole novel. <br /> <br />(On a sidenote, I was just a little frustrated that Picoult made a point that Chris' birthday was November 24th, and Emily's was May 7th, yet while Michael Gold is testifying and he's going into great detail about how Chris is like a son, and how they've grown up together, and how he knows Emily so well, he states that they are \\"three months apart\\"- it just ruined my suspension of disbelief for the rest of the courtroom scenes. And on that note, no jury worth their salt would have acquitted Chris Harte- that's just not the way the law works. )
B000BGR0OM|5.0|As other reviewers have stated, this collection probably won't have much appeal for hard-core Eurythmics fans, who probably have all these songs and more, already, in newly remastered form. <br /> <br />But for just about everyone else, this collection is exactly what the doctor ordered - 19 remastered cuts filling out over 79 minutes on one CD, with all the hits one could want, as well as some choice album tracks.  The Eurythmics were master song writers, and their excellent compositions are ideally suited for this treatment. <br /> <br />The sound is crisp and full - certainly, the cuts on this collection that I already own on other CDs sound far better on this CD, especially in the area of backing instrumentation and vocals.  Very nice, indeed. <br /> <br />The booklet is also well done, with lyrics and credits for each song.  No scrimping here, either. <br /> <br />I just reviewed the Kate Bush single-CD collection \\"The Whole Story\\", which was dismal in every area in which this one shines - thank goodness the Eurythmics received a much, much finer treatment. <br /> <br />As opposed to the Kate Bush collection, which soured me on buying any more of her material, this Eurythmics title inspires me to perhaps even spring for the Box, which features eight of their albums in remastered form with extensive bonus material. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
B000BHHVPO|5.0|I caught a glimpse of the Pink Floyd reunion on a big screen at Costco, well when I saw Roger Waters on stage with Dave Gilmour etc... I figured it must be a clip from the Live 8 show last summer. I originally purchased it for the purpose of witnessing this special event, but there is so much more to this disc set than just the Floyd reunion.  <br /> <br />Will Smith gives an example of how fast innocent people in Africa alone are dying from hunger. I could tell my 8 year old understood the gravity of the situation as she watched patiently. Bob Geldof replayed a clip of what he witnessed 20 years earlier in Africa that inspired him to take action. He also introduced a victim/survivor from that particular famine that accompanied Madonna on the first song of her set \\"Like A Prayer\\". But perhaps the most inspiring and touching set was Annie Lennox and her tribute to the victims of the AIDS epidemic in Africa. I was fully expecting to see adults during this sequence but when the majority of them were innocent children, I had to pull my kids close to me and thank god for their health. Believing in humanitarian causes does not make you a liberal. <br /> <br />I am only vaguely aware of several of the performers in this video. Several of them I'd never even heard of. However, they were all great. One of my favorite sets was The Pet Shop Boys in Moscow. I watched this show pretty much from beginning to end. The way they time it, you'd think you were watching one show when in actuality you are watching 6 to 7 shows over the course of nearly 10 hours. This is well worth the $30.00 Amazon is asking. You won't be disappointed!
B000AADYRQ|4.0|I liked this album better than I thought I would.  I guess that's not a glowing recommendation, but I hadn't really taken this band seriously before.  This is a good listen!
B0002Y4T92|5.0|I rarely ever buy DVDs, but after seeing this at a friend's house, I immediately ordered it. I have watched it at least 10 times, and it gets better each time. Unbelievable performances, fabulous guitar players, and wonderful music. Buy it; you won't be sorry.
0800177363|4.0|I use this film in a basic survey course to help explain many aspects of neurological research and treatment. Although seen as \\"syrupy\\" by professional film reviewers, a teacher can use this film's use of \\"one idea at a time\\" in a successful unit plan. My students range from those with learning disabilities who are mainstreamed to AP-level teenagers. All of the students love this film on so many levels; the exchange of ideas is fantastic. Use it in your classes!
B000E6UWE4|2.0|The problem, I think, is that the world and characters are so fleshed out and real to the author that he doesn't feel the need to fill in the gaps for the readers.  Between the author's vision and what you read is a HUGE chasm.  If only he had kept the pace and detail of the prologue.  It reminds me of Moorcock, where too much happens too fast to people you care too little for.  And it is high fantasy, where you have no idea what to expect to happen at any point in the story so you expect nothing, and don't care when it happens.  He makes the reader surprise-proof, and the idea of \\"plot twist\\" is absurd.  Wish it were otherwise.
0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee put pen to paper 50 years ago and wrote a classic. I re-read it recently and when I finished it I could not wait to recommend it to friends and family.

0684874350|4.0|I'm still not done with Angela's ashes, and this is the only reason I've reserved a 5-star rating. Its a compelling read, and a true testimony to the strenght and resilience of a human spirit destined to succeed. This book is beautifully written and immensely funny and provokes those of us who are quick to grumble about our lots in lives, that life truly is what we make of it. Well done McCourt!
1878424319|5.0|After reading this book, I thought - this is the way I want to live; this is the way I want to feel.  I bought The Four Agreements about a month ago and I have read it twice, and I will keep reading it.  My sister-in-law referred this book to me, and I have since referred it to many people.  They are happy to have read it - we encourage each other. <br /> <br />It is a strange little book but has a lot of impact.  Each agreement is important, and I am reminded of each agreement throughout the day, every day.  Each agreement is part of my life and I am glad - this is the way I want to live.  This book sticks; it stays in the mind.  Whatever I do or think, my reaction is instantly based on what I have read in the book, and what the four agreements have taught me.  It is not even difficult; it just becomes natural and I love it. <br /> <br />I love that I feel peaceful and well - indeed, this book has changed my life.
B00005JOFO|5.0|Ok, at first I wasn't going to see this movie. Then I thought, well, I'll read the short story, just to see what this is all about.  Well, I read the story in about 45 minutes, and it moved me so much, I knew that I would have to see it.  The next day, I skipped a grad class and went to the movies (I couldn't convince anyone to go with me)  This movie was so beautiful and moving.  The chemistry between the characters can't be described.  I found myself crying like a baby for most of the film.  Once I left, I couldn't stop talking about the movie.  I have told everyone that I know about how great it is.  Watching the movie, seeing the pain in the character's lives as they each can't be with the one person that he loves is heart wrenching.  I could write a 5000 word review and not be able to say enough about it.  Go see the film (or at least read the story)  It will move you (one way or the other) and it may cause you to look at life and love from another perspective.
0670287059|5.0|When I was a child my mother read this book to me.  I am now 30+ and still have this book memorized.  Now, I have the pleasure of reading this wonderfully entertaining book to my children.  Like me, they love finding the characters and trying to guess who we will see next!  Enjoy the timeless laughter of silly rhymes and wonderful characters!  Each peach pear plum I spy...
B00005NTN5|5.0|I find most of what Hollywood puts out to be absolute crap, but not 'Bound'.  This movie is actually quite good and entertaining.  The performances are memorable and the plot intriguing, however it does get off to somewhat of a slow start.  Be warned that the movie does make liberal use of the f-word as well as plenty of graphic violence, not to mention a very well done girl-girl love scene.
B00004THDI|5.0|this wonderfull score is the bast score of all time. You must have this score in your movie music collection.
B000000WA4|5.0|It brings a certain satisfaction and joy to my heart when I find an album that I can listen from beginning to end without skipping over songs.  This is EXACTLY that type of album.  If you're going on a 2-3 hour drive somewhere, put this on and your ride will seem like it was 10 minutes. <br /> <br />Seriously, I don't want to argue with any people that gave bad reviews to this album because they just simply don't know music and trying to preach them something is like smashing your head in the wall over and over. <br /> <br />I have to be honest, when I first heard this album I was kind of in the box and didn't like most of the songs and just the ones they play on the radio.  I was only 15 at the time so the mass media propaganda machine was working like a charm on me at the time. <br /> <br />In about 2000 when I turned 20 I picked this album up again and just listened to it from beginning to end like 3 times in a row.  I was hooked!!! <br /> <br />The production on this album, the music, lyrics and just everything is at it's highest level.   <br /> <br />Also, this is probably my favorite Smashing Pumpkins record. <br />Although all the other ones are really really good too. <br /> <br />So, seriously, buy this, put it in your stereo and enjoy! <br />This is going to be a classic in another 10 years... That'll be 20 years since the release, and that's when something can be considered a classic, or so I think. <br /> <br />Rock on!
0060194995|4.0|This a lyrical novel, written from a child's point of view, of the South, racial prejudice, and courage of one man. The child's point of view softens the hate and violence, but permits an innocence that promotes the theme of emerging conscience. Scout, Jem, and Atticus are well defined characters who form a loving family with children growing up amid \\"the Southern problem\\". The subtheme involving Boo Radley is tender, as the \\"monster\\" turns out to be a kind, but withdrawn, man (played by a young Robert Duvall in the movie version). As is often, but in this case truly, said: a must read.
B0000AKY7O|5.0|The overall sound on this CD is lush, breezy and very much a record to be played during the summertime. The vocals of the great Leon Thomas haunt one and Santanas guitarwork is very restrained. On one track it's unleashed. \\"Flame Sky\\" is a guitar battle between Carlos & John McLaughlin and is set just around a basic E minor/F major 7th chord progression...very simple..that's until the solos fly and both guitarists float in outer space!  McLaughlins classic machine gun,rapid fire riffs will scorch the hair on your head. <br /> Definitely one of the highest points in the careers of both men. <br /> A stunningly beautiful album throughout that is once again inspired largely by the music of the great John Coltrane.
B00007AJGH|5.0|Well-deserved Oscars for Editing, Visual Effects, Sound Effects Editing, and Special Achievement (animation direction) recommend this delightful film, which combines live action and animation before CGI came into regular use.  Watch for the beautifully realized details throughout.  For example, the Toons have shadows, and when one is thrown against a venetian blind, it bends and makes the sound of somebody actually hitting a venetian blind.  The interaction between live action and animation is so good, you quickly forget they're not really together at all -- and much of the credit for such realistic \\"interaction\\" must go to live actor Bob Hoskins.  There are a load of extras in this 2-disc package, including both fullscreen and widescreen versions, audio commentary, a deleted scene, and a very interesting \\"before and after\\" split-screen comparison with and without animation.  This is a technical masterpiece and well worth seeing again and again.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Serenity is a brilliant movie.  I know a few people who saw it in the theater who loved it, but I was not fortunate enough to see it before it was gone.  I only recently became a fan of the show, and seeing the Firefly series before I saw the movie made it even more fun.  I believe it is enjoyable no matter what you know (or don't know) going into it, but getting to spend fourteen episodes learning about nine crew members each with brilliant history and dialog makes seeing them in a great film a wonderful experience.  This movie had all the infectious humor of the TV series along with the same great visual effects, solid narrative and brilliant dialog.  Do yourself a favor and buy Serenity and the TV show it was based on, Firefly.  I'm confident you will enjoy them as much as I have.
B00003CXD0|5.0|Dustin Hoffman, arguably one of the most popular actors of the 1980s and 90s, is in top form here -- but this time as a woman.  Sure, there have been other films with similar setups -- \\"Victor/Victoria\\" with Julie Andrews and \\"Mrs. Doubtfire\\" with Robin Williams, to name just two.  Andrews, however, isn't believable as a man, and while Williams is exceptional in \\"Doubtfire,\\" that movie seems to lose its \\"edge\\" near the end.  In \\"Tootsie,\\" Jessica Lange, Teri Garr, and Dabney Coleman all provide laudable -- even outstanding -- performances.  Lange won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, and Garr was nominated in that category.  Dustin Hoffman was nominated for Best Actor, Sidney Pollack for Best Director, and the film for Best Picture.  Why didn't it win any of those three?  One word -- \\"Gandhi.\\"  Nevertheless, \\"Tootsie\\" looks as though it were fun to make, and it is certainly fun to watch.  This is an absolute must for Dustin Hoffman fans.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Like many of the reviews here, I was not even aware of Firefly when it was on back in 2002 and 2003.  Recently my brother-in-law was telling me about Firefly.  He loved the episodes he had seen but had not finished watching all of them yet and offered to let me barrow his copies once he finished watching the whole series.  Around the same time a good friend was telling me about the movie Serenity, which he saw with co-workers and loved.  At first I didn't know the two were related, but for whatever reason I didn't think to rent the series or look into it much beyond what they had shared with me at this point.  Then one day I was flipping channels on TV when I caught a small part of the episode \\"Bushwhacked\\" on the Sci-Fi channel.  The episode was good, but I caught it midway through so I wasn't completely aware of what was going on.  Still something about it kept my attention so I watched the remaining part of the episode.  Right after the episode was over another one began, it was \\"Shindig\\" and as the show opened I realized this was show I was enjoying was Firefly.  I watched the episode and as it turned out I was in luck because they were running the episodes in order back-to-back.  I became more entranced by the episodes and when I got to the one called \\"Our Mrs. Reynolds\\" I was officially a fan.  I managed to catch a few more episodes that day at varying times but I was already very interested in seeing more.  I checked back on the Sci-Fi channel every day for the next couple weeks hoping to catch another marathon so I could see more of what I missed.  It wasn't on and I was getting anxious to see the shows I missed.  Finally I couldn't wait and I went out in search of the DVD set.  I found it at a local store and I also purchased the follow-up movie, Serenity while I was there.  It was money well spent! <br /> <br />My wife and I watched every episode together.  She really likes the show, and I love it!  The only thing I didn't like was reaching the end.  The last episode \\"Objects In Space\\" was a brilliant finish to a perfect show.  Before I knew it I was watching all the episodes a second time and then watching the ones with commentary and all of the special extras on the fourth disk.  I loved this show more than I loved Star Wars or Star Trek or even most of my favorite movies!  For me to say something like this is huge because I never thought I would love any TV series more than the original Star Wars movies or the Star Trek series.  It wasn't even a close comparison.  The characters are perfectly written, the humor is captivating and perfectly timed, the action is always fast-paced and exciting, and special effects are the best in the business.  My wife doesn't care much for Science Fiction nor does she like the Western genre much but she genuinely likes this show.  I'm not much for Westerns but I've never loved a show more than this one. <br /> <br />There is so much depth to the stories and the dialog is the finest I have ever seen on a TV show (or most movies).  Even many of the guest-stars on this show were examples of perfect casting.  I only started watching this series in February, but I am so happy that I found Firefly.  I saw the movie Serenity after watching all the episodes in order, which makes seeing the movie even more gratifying.  Any person who reads these reviews and buys this show will not be disappointed.  I believe it would be difficult to find anyone who didn't enjoy this show immensely.  I never watched much of Joss's work before this, but after Firefly I will pay a lot more attention to any project he is involved in.  Firefly truly is the best TV show I have ever watched (and I've watched plenty of TV).  Do yourself a favor, watch this show! <br />

B000B8QEZG|5.0|I never feel the need to review anything but this CD is just off the hook.  I can honestly say that I don't find myself skipping over boring tracks (A first for me). My favorites are #'s: 1,2,3,6,7,& 10.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|Why??  Why even attempt to remake a film that was so fantastic?  This is like remaking Gone With the Wind.  I had high hopes for the movie, with its big budget and great looking cast, but they were not met.  The movie departs from the book, and the editing and script do not give enough time or substance to fully develop the characters.  The one thing I thought they did well was to depict the country dances as being significantly more back-woods than the ones in town.  By the way, I think it's a JOKE that Kira Knightly got an Oscar nod for this performance.  P-lease.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I saw Serenity three times in the theatre.  FOX cancelled the series (Firefly) when they should have given viewers the opportunity to discover it.  If you were a Firefly fan you'll be pleased to see the same characters in the movie.  Lots of action and a decent story line you'll not be bored.

B00004T9UF|5.0|Eminem is my favorite rapper (along with Eazy-E R.I.P.) and this is his best album to date. It includes some of the best rap songs ever recorded including The Way I Am and Bitch Please II. Nonetheless there is only one song on this album that is not that good (Drug Ballad) and every single other song is perfect. The album flows perfectly together and is lyrically incredible. Most people thought Eminem was going to hit a sophomore slump but this blows his first album away. Every beat is perfect... every rhyme is unique and every featured artist does an awesome job. I can't express enough my love for this album except to say that it can't be beat. All his albums are great but I just wish they were all THIS great.
0446677450|1.0|A person who buys this book and subscribe to this snake oil is helping make Kiyosaki rich and himself poor.  Too bad Amazon has nothing less than 1 star.  Kiyosaki is a huckster.  I wonder how many people are getting hurt by his lousy advice. <br /> <br />This book is debunked by a well referenced John Reed <br />[...] <br /> <br />John Reed should be the one writing a book.
B00005JO1R|5.0|Walk the Line tells a biographical account of Johnny Cash's (Joaquin Phoenix) life up to the mid-point of his life.  However, it does not focus on his musical achievements during this time although they are a major part of his life.  Instead, the film efficiently displays the maturation of his character. In the process, the audience gets a poignant glimpse into the roots and soul of his music.  The film opens in Folsom Prison in 1968, as Johnny fingers a circle saw while thinking of his childhood.  In one long flashback, the film provides a uniquely inspiring and genuinely moving picture of his agonizing life and constant search for something better.<br /><br />[Potential Spoilers Ahead For Viewers Unaware of Johnny Cash's Life]<br /><br />Even though people are the sum of their experiences, there are defining moments that shape our character and persona. Johnny Cash had several defining moments that helped form his identity, which had the possibility to strengthen, or destroy him.  Walk the Line offers an opportunity for the audience to see how he responded on these moments.  It also displays the importance that other people have on an individual's existence, as Johnny would not have succeeded, or overcome his predicaments without the love and care of others.<br /><br />Johnny Cash's life was everything, but easy, to which his songs are a testament.  Early on Johnny suffered the loss of his older brother, a death his father blamed on him.  He had a love hate relationship with his father, as he continuously sought his father's love by trying to please him.  However, every attempt was met with a put down.  The absence of his supportive and encouraging older brother left a large rift in his life, as it also continued to haunt him with agonizing guilt.  Besides the guilt, Johnny had to endure emotional neglect and abuse from his father who projected his own shortcomings onto him, which did not only continue to foster guilt, but also poor self-esteem and more anxiety.<br /><br />In the small home, where Johnny grew up he could not escape his father's physical presence, but he sought emotional refuge in music.  The radio and his mother's soothing singing offered him in moments of unease a chance to escape in spirit and mind.  Eventually, he came of age to leave home and a not a day too late he joined the Air Force.  Johnny ended up stationed in Germany during the Korean War for which his father also ridiculed him, as he did not fight the war like other real men.  The cut downs did not cease in Johnny's adulthood.  His father upheld the same loveless relationship with Johnny.<br /><br />Being an outsider, Johnny did not really fit in the military lifestyle. Again, he sought refuge in music, as a cure to his solitude. He acquired a guitar and taught himself how to handle the instrument. Soon he began to write his own material reflecting on the environment around him while letting his feelings steer his pen and fingers over the guitar strings. It is in this cerebral state where Johnny discovered peace and joy, but it also began the sanctuary where Johnny could exorcise some of his personal demons.<br /><br />Despite Johnny beginning to feel freer through music, he still hampered his own growth by trying to please others such as a future father-in-law and his father.  For example, his marriage to Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), doomed from the beginning, displays his noble attempt to please others while in the process slowly killing the joy within him.  Not that Vivian was a bad person, but they were not right for each other as Johnny merely tried to make everyone else happy.  The desire to make others like him ran deep within Johnny, who acquired this personal trait in a young age by constantly trying to prove himself worthy of his father's affection.<br /><br />Thus, it is easy to see how Johnny fell in love with June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) in their first encounter.  The upbeat beauty had a wondrous voice and a great sense of humor that brought about laughter, which must have been something Johnny dearly must have lacked during his upbringing.  She did not judge him, but shared her willingness to appreciate him and his music. June made him feel alive, worthy, and free of judgment.  Yet, Johnny could not enter her life, as he was married and she has recently got out of a bad divorce.<br /><br />Despite the distance between Johnny and June, he continued to long for her.  With the years his affection only grew stronger, until he came to a crossroads of pain where he once again was forced to face his demons.  Alone, he sought alternative ways of tranquilizing the agony within through a heavy drug addiction, which began harmlessly while partying with the other great musicians such as Elvis Presley (Tyler Hilton) and Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Payne).  The drugs affected him to the point where he no longer could interact or perform with others.<br /><br />The many experiences and life defining moments in Johnny's life show a scarred battling fighter trying to overcome his excruciating past with love and music.  The black outfit serves a fitting symbolical value to Johnny, as a reminder of his past transgressions.  It is also here that Johnny Cash's greatness rests, as he does not pretend to be someone else.  He sings about the daily struggles that many suffer.  It provides something that people can relate to, but also find that they are not alone.  Thus, before a performance when Johnny Cash said with his unique voice, \\"Hello, I'm Johnny Cash.\\"  It convincingly echoed within each listener - his is one of us.<br /><br />There are several aspects of Walk the Line that make it a brilliant film.  First of all, James Mangold is the perfect director for the film, as his profound understanding of human psychology only seems to improve, which also heavily influenced his previous films Girl, Interrupted (1999) and Identity (2003).  Several of the actors provide solid performances, especially Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix in the leads.  However, the supporting cast also helps bring out the emotional qualities in the main characters.  One must naturally also include the music, which is superb throughout the film.

B00005JKDR|5.0|This movie is a delight. The twist of having monsters afraid of little children is brilliant. This should really be of interest to kids who don't like monsters in their rooms. Especially not at night! I could go on raving about it... Just see it!
B0006MT314|5.0|I like the album a lot because it has some of my favorite artists (Story of the Year, Butch Walker).  And it also has newer artists that I know of because of the show (Tyler Hilton, etc).  If you enjoy the music on \\"One Tree Hill\\" and how it conveys the emotions of the characters, then you will enjoy this album!

B00005MP58|5.0|I have watched this 6-hour adaptation of Pride and Prejudice so many times I can't count them.  And every time I have been as interested as the first time--maybe more so.  I have also seen a lot of poor casting and presentations of Jane Austen's work that were a waste of my time.  The characters in this Pride and Prejudice version were lively and realistic.  If I could give it 10 stars, I would.
0316779237|4.0|If you are looking for the literary equivalent of \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\"-this book is definitely NOT for you. However, if you appreciate slightly cynical and sardonic commentary on the holidays, you will most likely appreciate this set of short stories by David Sedaris. From Jim Timothy, the extortionist who preys upon a Pentecostal church, to Dinah, the \\"Christmas [...]\\" Sedaris packs his vignettes with unforgettable characters who will make you laugh-even though you know Clarence the Angel would disapprove. If you've had enough of family bickering and other such holiday treats, curl up with this offering and you'll find a kindred spirit in David Sedaris.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|The Phantom Of The Opera, a wonderful movie.  If you have ever read the book, this movie is for you.  The sound tradk C.D. is also great.  Buy both, to be enjoyed thourghly.
B0009MDPYM|1.0|My goodness. I rented this movie expecting a scary thriller and it almost put me to sleep. This is Keanu Reeves' Sorriest performance to date...... not that he has had many good ones. His acting was horrible in this movie and the whole movie did not make sense and was just plain Boring to watch. I was very disappointed for this film is just plain awful!!!!!!!
B000062YAZ|1.0|I'm going to be frank in my review. I don't doubt that the members of this band have talent, undoubtedly more than myself. It's just a shame that they have to waste that perfectly good talent playing antimusic (death metal). I know rock, I've listened to my share, but this was a waste of 35 minutes. It needs some concrete music theory behind it, or it has no direction. And yes, most rock music does have theory behind it, believe it or not. Playing random chords as loud as you can and having someone attempt to destroy a drum set somewhat rhythmically does not constitute any kind of music. Please people, come to your senses and listen to some real music! If you like metal, listen to Judas Priest, Black Sabbath, Van Halen, KISS, and if you like some classic stuff, Led Zeppelin or Deep Purple. Save your money, and buy music by the aforementioned artists instead. Your eardrums will thank you later.
B000089RW0|2.0|The idea of a haunted ship sounded good to me! I looked forward to seeing Ghost Ship but was disappointed. The film does have a very cool opening scene! which shows viewers what happened on this ship many years ago. The ship ends up disappearing and many years later, a crew finds it as it suddenly re-appears. The crew climb aboard the old cruise ship hoping to claim any valueables that were left. They find more than that... they find the boat haunted!  Not a true horror movie but it has some good parts and some not so good parts. If you watch this movie, don't expect to be scared...... you won't be!
0553801503|5.0|It was tough to write this review; how am I to sum it all up in  a few paragraphs? I'll settle for saying this: when I was small I used to find books that physically could not stop reading once I'd  begun. But when I grew up it never happened again. Until I found A Song of Ice and Fire. <br /> <br />Some have complained that A Feast For Crows had too little plot in it. That didn't bother me; I missed reading about such characters as Tyrion and Daenerys, but I know they'll be back and their  absence only whetted my apetite for their next appearence. The only problem is that I think that the tension of waiting for the next volume may just kill me.

B00005V9HH|5.0|Bryan Singer was a young director during the filming of The Usual Suspects, and he was working with some of the biggest egos and some of the most talented dramatic and character actors of the day.  Watch the extra features content and you'll see why the combination was so trying for Singer and how one of the best scenes in the film wasn't purposely filmed but pieced together from the few moments when the cast stopped acting like children.  And then there's the controversy with Benicio Del Toro's interpretation of Fred Fenster, which nearly leads to a rebellion by the rest of the cast. <br /> <br />As for the film, almost everything has been said.  This is Pulp Fiction taken to the meta-fictional level; it's aware of its own structure.  Somehow, the film gets away with telling more often than showing the audience the story.  Since information and misinformation are both mixed and hidden in the film, the viewer experiences the rare treat of actual surprise at the film's conclusion.  This is one of those films that, after you have seen it a few times, you feel proud to show it to someone who's never seen it or heard about it.  This is a must for any personal film library. <br />
B00003CXA6|5.0|Gettysburg is an excellent film. It is well acted, with excellent cinematography and outstanding realistic pacing. I won't get in-depth with the story, as that has already been done, but here are a few things any prospective viewer may want to know....     First, the source material. The movie is based on the award winning (and EXCELLENT) book, The Killer Angels by Michael Shaara (incidentally, his son Jeff has been writing war novels to follow in his dad's footsteps for years now). The movie follows the novel closely, and for historically nitpickers, that isn't always a good thing. The most glaring example is the usage of Joshua Chamberlain as the 'unsung' hero of Gettysburg. As any true student of the Civil War should know, the events involving Chamberlain on Little Round Top in the book and the film are BASED ON CHAMBERLAIN'S OWN VERSION OF THE EVENTS. Chamberlain was a NOTORIOUS self-promoter after the war, and not a SINGLE man in his old command backed up his version of events. Quite a few outright disputed Chamberlain's version. For example, some insisted that Chamberlain's brilliant bayonett charge NEVER HAPPENED. Not that the charge didn't happen- just that Chamberlain had nothing to do with it. They stated that the charge happened spontaniously (a common occurence in the warfare of that era), and was NOT the result of any plan or order from Chamberlain. Chamberlain simply saw an opportunity to grab glory for himself by claiming credit for the charge. Any in-depth investigation into the man will reveal his true personal character was hardly the shining hero atop Little Round Top that he wished to convey. Taking personal credit for the spontanious actions of an entire regiment is not even ethical, much less heroic. Michael Shaara apparently bought Chamberlain's version of events hook, line, and sinker. Sadly, Shaara's book had such an impact on the public consciousness that many believe that the version of Chamberlain depicted in the book is based on real historical fact, when really it is at best EXTREMELY dubious storytelling. Having said that, Shaara's book is still very close to the actual events that happened. There is a little creative license to create drama, but for the most part it accurated depicts what happened during those three July days of 1863.     One other minor grievance I had with the film was the battle scenes. While very authentic looking, the scenes still suffered from something that most war films suffer from: a lack of combatants! The assault on Little Round Top on the second day involved MANY thousands of confederate soldiers, yet the scenes of this assault only show about 20-30 rebels at any one time. Even a skirmish would involve more men assaulting the 20th Maine than that! Obviously, the budget constraints and shortage of reenactors are to blame, and so can be forgiven. Just be aware that ALL the assaults were MUCH grander in scope than what you are seeing onscreen, including the third day's charge (incorrectly labelled Pickett's Charge by history).      Of course, both of these grievances are very minor points, and do not subtract from the power and drama of the film (notice I still gave it 5 stars!). The cast has a lot to do with why this movie is so powerful: an excellent job is done by virtually the whole cast, with Jeff Daniels standing out in particular (ironically enough, Daniels portrays Joshua Chamberlain). Daniels' scene when he learns of a comrade's death is the most poignant in the entire movie, and reminds us that the 'glory' of battle comes with a terrible price indeed. On a slightly more sour note, C. Thomas Howell does a barely adequate job. A better actor should have been chosen to portray Chamberlain's younger brother Tom, and thank god Ted Turner only has a cameo, his acting is ATROCIOUS.      The location scenery is both historically accurate (or close enough) and beautifully utilized, and the battle choregraphy is quite good, considering the limited budget and largely volunteer cast of extras.      Overall, Gettysburg is the absolute BEST Civil War movie ever made. It is very powerful, and if you you have any interest in one of the most important events in America's history, I encourage you to watch this movie. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECCOMENDATION!      As a side note, a follow up movie, Gods & Generals, was made. Sadly, it does not live up to the expectations set by Gettysburg. Feel free to check out my review of Gods & Generals.
B00003CXP1|5.0|The horrors of addiction and the death of dreams fill this intense tale.  The film shows how so much of everything we do can become an addiction, an unhealthy and even dangerous routine if we put an unrealistic focus on impossible, materialistic dreams.  The breakneck visuals concentrate the brutal honesty of the film.  In the hands of a less talented director, the visual techniques would have appeared more like a music video and less as a narrative.  The score of the film consists mostly of variations on the same piece of music.  The haunting remixes accurately represent the film's dark mood. <br /> <br />If you respected this film (it's hard to \\"enjoy\\" a film such as this), you may like Darren Aronofsky's Pi as well. <br /> <br />Be sure to get the director's cut of Requiem for a Dream.  There is no reason to belittle this film by pretending that its subjects are only rated R. <br />
B00003CX9W|5.0|Fantasia is the all-time classic animated movie. Where to begin with this one? The animation is incredible, with stunning artwork, effects, and a huge palet of colors. The storytelling is top-notch, with excellent pacing and story development. Using classical music as a storytelling tool is A LOT harder than you may think, and the Disney animators pulled it off brilliantly. Each segment of Fantasia is its own self-contained movie, and each one is a winner. Even the weakest segment (the first one) is still an outstanding example of innovation (jawdropping for the 1940's). Other than the first segment, all stand up perfectly to repeated viewings. Fantasia is an AMAZING movie, which will entertain adults as much as children (a rarity). It is fitting in an ironic way, then, that Fantasia was also Disney's biggest flop when it was released in 1940. Oftentimes truly outstanding works take many years to be be recognized as the masterpieces they are (Wizard Of Oz, Its A Wonderful Life).      As far as the editing goes, I would like to address the Deems Taylor issue (he was the original narrator). The Disney people HAD to redub Taylor's voice, because a lot of the original recordings were LOST. NONE of the VHS or movie re-edits since the original 1940 release contained the missing narration. As they had only PART of Deems recorded narration, but ALL of the footage of Deems, they decided to redub the whole narration for continuity's sake. A tough decision, but an understandable one.  The editing in the pastoral sequence is tougher to defend. Editing out a 1940's era stereotypical black servant is the PC way to do things, but is pretending it never happened a smart thing to do? Seeing the movie blemishes and all would send a better message, and a reminder that we have advanced a bit since 1940. However, I can completely understand Disney's editing. In this sickenly politically correct era, if Disney had released Fantasia unedited, they would be boycotted and labelled racists by a bunch of idiotic mental midgets who can't fathom the simple concept that viewing the material doesn't mean you agree with what it represents. HIDING THE MATERIAL DOESN'T MEAN IT DIDN'T EXIST, and that is something those same mental midgets will never understand (and they don't want to).      Anyone who can appreciate true art in any form MUST view Fantasia at least once in their life. This pinnacle of Disney creativity will most likely never be topped, and stands as cinema's greatest animated feature of all time.      HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!
B00005ATQF|5.0|Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket is one of the greatest wars films ever made.  The film stands with and apart from Kubrick's anti-war films, Paths of Glory and Dr. Strangelove.  Full Metal Jacket takes its subject seriously.  It's not interested in sensation and artifice; rather, the film is interested in the young men who train to be killers and go into other countries to do terrible things.  To claim that the film doesn't have some element of anti-war theme would be disingenuous, but the psychological reality of war is darkly documented here. <br /> <br />It appears that Kubrick lifted and borrowed from sources other than the novel The Short Timers, on which the film is based.  Familiar elements are given new life under Kubrick's wonderful direction. <br /> <br />I am somewhat annoyed that this version is full screen and not wide screen.  Other Kubrick films from this collection were not even re-mastered (the video of the 2001: A Space Odyssey DVD was very grainy).  This version of Full Metal Jacket appears to have been re-mastered, but go for the wide screen version if you can find it. <br />
B000BM6AVA|5.0|system of a down has not recorded one song that i get tired of, i can play them over and over, it's rock opara and it's flipping awesome, this is their best so far, each new album surpasses the one beforehand. hynotize is great it's all the previous for chalked up into one, plus a ejaculation a new stuff, this stuff is great to do anything to,  just get system of a down blast it and do something, try blindside and embodiment and flyleaf to, and kittie, i am telling you you can not go wrong. Jared what a guy.
B00004UBBG|5.0|OK, you could say this is a notch below \\"Mott.\\"  Still, that is high praise indeed, as \\"Mott\\" is one of the greatest rock'n'roll albums ever.  With \\"The Hoople,\\" we get more of the same, but on a slightly different wavelength.  With the departure of Mick Ralphs, the guitar situation was somewhat confused, leaving more room  for Ian Hunter's keyboards in the mix.  That isn't to say that \\"The Hoople\\" doesn't rock - it does, and like a madman.  \\"The Golden Age of Rock'n'Roll,\\" \\"Born Late '58\\" (with Overend Watts on vocals), and \\"Crash Street Kidds\\" are first rate proto-punk rockers with Hunter's pounding piano adding to the wonderful noise.  \\"Roll Away the Stone\\" simply soars, and the psychodrama of \\"Marionette\\" is funny and frightening.  Two highlights are \\"Alice\\" and \\"Pearl'n'Roy (England)\\" - loping music hall numbers driven by Hunter's pseudo-barrelhouse piano and gutter poetry.  Yeah, this may be a notch below \\"Mott,\\" but that just means that \\"Mott\\" rates a 10 and \\"The Hoople\\" is a 9.9 - still sheer brilliance in my book.
006056251X|4.0|I awaited this book with bated breath.  Although Lisa Kleypas did not disappoint, I do believe I let my imagination carry me off in an entirely different direction to what she portrayed.  I was hoping for a FAR more devilish hero, one that I would love to hate, but with whom I would eventually fall in love (at the same time as the heroine, naturally).  I awaited internal conflicts between the pair, rather than those of an external variety.  The Sebastian of my imagination and the Sebastian of the story were two different souls. <br /> <br />Evie was reserved, shy and beautiful, with an immeasurable depth of empathy and caring for others.  Sebastian (not the wicked rake of my dreams), the fallen Angel, was jaded but rather easily affected by Evie. <br /> <br />Despite my expectations for something else entirely, I still found myself enjoying both hero and heroine immensely.  They meshed well, and played off of one another beautifully.
B00006J3WH|4.0|I must admit that the first time I saw the episode \\"Once More With Feeling\\" I was a bit disappointed. I didn't think it quite lived up to all the hype and in any case, I was suffering from the mild disillusionment which accompanied \\"Buffy's\\" so-so sixth season.<br /><br />Much later, after the season had wrapped, I watched the \\"Making Of\\" featurette on the DVD. It was only then I realized how much creative effort had gone into making it. It took a few minutes for my eyebrows to lower back into place when I realized that Joss Whedon had not merely conceived the episode but had actually written all the songs, all the lyrics, all the music and all the dialogue as a \\"summer school project\\" between Season Five and Season Six. A labor of love like that must be given a second hearing, so in went the DVD for an encore. It was a good decision.<br /><br />Everyone is going to have their personal favorites as far as the songs go, and in fact the main reason I bought the album originally was for James Marsters' rock 'n roll power ballad \\"Rest in Peace\\", but once I got it other favorites soon emerged. For one, I was surprised how much I enjoyed Sarah Michelle Gellar's vocals on \\"Going Through the Motions\\", \\"Walk Through the Fire\\" and \\"Something to Sing About.\\" Show tunes are not exactly my thing, but although she isn't a professional singer (like Marsters her voice comes off as a little strained) she has a pleasant singing voice and brings the same subtlety of emotion into her singing as she does to her acting.<br /><br />\\"Under Your Spell\\" showcases the superb pipes of Amber Benson, who really does sound like a pro as she dances about, and the two songs by Hinton Battle, who plays the smooth-dancin' demon Sweet, have a kind of gleefully evil scene-stealing quality to them, especially the line about \\"I can bring whole cities to ruin/and still have time to get a soft shoe in.\\"<br /><br />Of course, it wouldn't be Buffy if there wasn't a dose of absolutely over-the-top foreshadowing, and so we have Nicky Brendon and Emma Caulfield do their since-'n-dance duet, which is not merely a microcosm of their relationship but prefigures its downfall. Brendon is of course no singer, but it is completely in line with Xander's character that even when possessed by magic mojo, he still sounds like any tone-deaf dude wailing away in a shower. As always the terrific chemistry he has with Caulfield's Anya has to make you laugh and groan at the same time:<br /><br />ANYA: When things get rough he/just hides behind his Buffy/now look he's gettin' huffy/'cause he knows that I know.<br /><br />XANDER: She clings/she's needy/she's also really greedy/she--<br /><br />ANYA: His eyes are beady!<br /><br />XANDER: This is my verse, hello!<br /><br />Caulfield is also hilarious when she interrupts the groupsing in the Magic Shop to launch into a rock 'n roll rant against bunnies (or maybe midgets?).<br /><br />Of course no review would be complete without mentioning Tony Head, who along with Battle is one of the only professionals on the album. Not surprisingly, he gets saddled with the heavy \\"Standing\\", which is a fine enough song, but I would have preferred it if Wheedon had given him something ridiculously out of character -- some head-banging bit of noise from his Ripper days, maybe.<br /><br />I guess the most impressive thing about the episode/album is that the characters aren't just singing lyrics, they're singing dialogue, dialogue which it turns out is probably the most important of the season, since it foreshadows all the conflicts which are to bloom later between Buffy & Spike, Xander & Anya, Tara & Willow, and also the unseen inner conflicts of Giles and Dawn. I guess you could say it's a blueprint for the whole year put to music.<br /><br />I have to say still don't like the sixth season very much, it remains my least favorite of the seven, but \\"Once More With Feeling\\" is definitely one of its brightest spots.foreshadowing, and so we have Nicky Brendon and Emma Caulfield do their since-'n-dance duet, which is not merely a microcosm of their relationship but prefigures its downfall.

0780626966|5.0|Any one who is building a collection of horror films, or DVDs in general would be foolish to turn away from this one. This is the ultimate collection available currently with 8 discs covering all 7 films. The 8th disc of extras is a good bit of fun to navigate for fans of the series, but might be a bit over the top for the casual user. However its great to see the makers, make an effort in the design of the collection. The extras include Freddy's MTV appearances plus commentary's and interviews. Some great eighties memories. All in all I couldn't recommend this pack more.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|This is the most fabulous and inspiring movie I think I have ever seen.  I live in a podunk town several hours north of San Francisco.  I would probably never have been able to see this incredible show on the stage.  Thank God that Revolution Studios made this great musical available as a movie. <br /> <br />I can only say that for me, this movie is life changing.  Since I received it five days ago, I have watched it at least seven times!  Seeing this movie has really opened my eyes towards people who are considered outcasts or disenfranchised by society - gays, tran-gendered, homeless, poor, those with AIDS, those struggling with addiction.  Watching RENT showed me how all of them are just PEOPLE like myself, trying to overcoming the tough parts of life with sensitivity and love. <br /> <br />This show is especially popular with young people.  I think that they realize better that the rest of us how ALL of us are disenfranchised by the current world system.  Watching RENT is an affirmation of all that is good about being human. <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor and BUY THIS MOVIE! <br />
B000E1YVZU|5.0|A dream release for RENTheads and movie musical fans everywhere.  Sony could have opted to go bare bones with this initial release but decided to go full-out with the special edition. <br /> <br />The movie has transferred beautifully to DVD format.  Picture and sound quality are superb. <br /> <br />Special features include a commentary by Chris Columbus, Adam Pascal and Anthony Rapp.  Columbus offers some interesting insight into directorial choice, but Rapp and Pascal steal the show with a delightful banter that casts a new light on the film-making process and the tight bond of this wonderful cast. <br /> <br />Other special features include deleted scenes, PSAs and the trailers for the film.  <br /> <br />The golden ticket in this DVD, however, is \\"No Day But Today\\" a full length documentary on Jonathan Larson and the inception of RENT.  The documentary is heart-wrenching and beautifully well-constructed.  The documentary alone is worth the price of this DVD. <br /> <br />This DVD is a true gift to RENTheads everywhere.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|Beautifully and brilliantly composed music by Gustavo Santaolalla!  I started reciting my favorite songs from the CD but found myself including all of them.  The music and the songs resonate with the spirit of the movie - Absolutely Perfect!
0790733226|5.0|This is a movie that everyone should see at least once in there life. The movie was just really good. What makes it so good is that it is very believable, VERY BELIEVABLE, but yet leaves you wondering and thinking in the end...  <br /> <br />The movie just grips you and doesnt let go! The acting in it is amazing and this should have won a lot of awards. Everyone that i tell to watch this movie never really believes me that its good, they think its a typical sci-fi boring space movie... But after they watch it they sit back and are like WOW that was really good! its surprisingly VERY GOOD MOVIE. DEFINATELTY A MUST SEE!!! 5 stars!!
0385338686|5.0|I've read everything Sophie Kinsella has written and this is one of my favorites. I found myself laughing out loud at some points. I can't wait untill her next one comes out.
0307276902|3.0|A Million Little Pieces is a good book to reed. But the writer dident mention it was fiction untill later making himself look like a hero. That is not nice to the readers but anyway its a good book fillid whith drugs, sex, love, and rootcanals.
B0000C9V3T|4.0|Everybody knows that Quentin Tarantino knows how to put together a great soundtrack, and this is no exception.  With a perfect blend of East and West, this album covers all the best music from the film.
0312199066|4.0|I have read several books about the early space race and have enjoyed all of them. Gene Cernan's book is no exception. He describes his early years as a test pilot and how he strived to earn a place as an astronaut in NASA's space program. He talks eloquently about the infighting between all of the astronauts. Cernan also doesn't mince his words about how he felt about certain astronauts! That enough is enlightening.<br /><br />He writes with a \\"you are there\\" experience as he describes the sheer work and near terror of not getting back into his Gemini spacecraft during an early space walk. He also describes the feelings that went on behind the scenes with the astronaut wives. For some of us who remember these early space shots, it is remarkable to think back on that time and what the wives must have been experiencing.<br /><br />Finally, Cernan completes his book with a look at the Apollo missions, culminating with Apollo 17 and his views as being the last man on the moon.<br /><br />I certainly enjoyed the book and highly recommend it as an edition for your bookshelf!
0812550706|5.0|I've been reading in all genres, but particularly SF, since I was young, and this is probably the one book that I've gone back to and re-read the most times.  It's hard to identify exactly what's so compelling about it -- the characters, the settings, the plot, all work together to make a book that is thoroughly enjoyable.  I also like the way it sets up for the others in the series, while standing with full completion on its own (and the others in the series are generally not as good, by the way, though still not bad).  If you haven't read this book yet, you're missing out on a true gem.
B0000025RI|5.0|\\"Thriller\\" is up there as one of my favorite albums.  It became a phenominon onto its own.  Everyone bought it back then.  After a listen through you'll see why. It has almost a magical feel to it.  Michael continued to work with producer Quincy Jones who delivered a fresh sound that we would never forget.  The videos were another realm of media which further promoted the album.  Who could forget those scary-looking monsters?  Every song on here is incredible.  Michael's talent is no-doubt the centerpiece of this album.  It's well produced and show's how great of a singer-songwriter Michael Jackson is.  If you're new to Michael jackson, you'll realize why he was so popular back then despite all the bad press these days.  My personal favorites are \\"Beat It\\", \\"Wanna Be Startin Somethin\\" and \\"Human Nature.\\" it's REALLY hard for me to c hose because I love all the songs.  This album will always have a special place in my heart.  \\"Thriller\\" is the  biggest selling album of all time with over 60 million copies sold worldwide. I urge you to join the crowd and get your own copy!
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I don't really know anything about Final Fantasy, but I LOVED this movie!  The story is really good, and there is enough information given in the beginning that throughout the movie I figured out what was going on.      The Graphics...what can I say about them?...AMAZING!! It is the best CG movie I have ever seen in terms of animation.  The action sequences rocked, and the music was great.  And there was a nice mix of comedy (thanks to Reno and Rude)...and action (...).      Anyway..recommended...
B000002AS3|5.0|Definitely Maybe ranks alongside Sgt. Pepper (concept), Murmur (College radio / alternative), Nevermind (grunge), Too Far to Care (alt country) as truly seminal works of rock and roll.  This album single handedly resurrected Brit-pop and stimulated interest in a genre that was in dire need of a jolt of energy.  <br /> <br />In terms of debut, almost nothing compares to the end to end brilliance of Definitely Maybe.  Amazing lyrics, otherworldly guitar by Noel, and the best chops in rock by Liam, culimating with the incredible \\"Slide Away\\". <br /> <br />If you only own 10 CD's, this is a must.
B00004XONN|5.0|'A music fan' needs to be silenced.   <br />This is Radiohead's riskiest, best album;  Yorke's voice is brilliant in this, and so are the multilayered sounds--every time you listen you decipher a new underlying pattern in the lyrics and beats.  Kid A truly rewards repeated listening; its puzzle couldn't possibly bore you.  My favorite is \\"idioteque\\", perhaps the most layered and depressing piece.
0060594888|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book very much. Much of the advice that Jack provides is simple and easy to put to use. The examples of people who applied the principles are very effective. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to go to the next level of success.
B00006DEF9|5.0|just the singin' in the rain sequence is worth getting the movie
B0000CDL93|5.0|i couldnt tell you how much i love this film,, i have been waiting on this 2 disc set for a while and i gotta say it was worth it the 2nd disc has a great doc. and extra scence, i can not write a review because this movie is too good for words

0060574216|4.0|Men are from Mars, a place where temperatures now rarely if ever get above the freezing point of water, but in the past, near-surface temperatures have locally and temporarily permitted extensive melting of ground ice. Mars has only a thin carbon dioxide atmosphere today, the highest surface pressures being less than 10millibars, yet there is ample evidence of a much denser atmosphere in the past. Even now, the thin Martian atmosphere can sustain dust storms and major wind erosion.  <br /> <br />Women, on the other hand, are from Venus. Venus has a carbon dioxide atmosphere, clouds of what appears to be sulfuric acid, and surface pressure on the order of 90 bars. Temperatures on the surface of Venus, Earth's near-twin in size, are around 450C, high enough to affect the geothermal gradient and perhaps the nature of rock deformation. The extreme temperatures on Earth-like planets have undoubtedly had fundamental direct and indirect influence on the nature of planetary landforms, far more than we once believed.
B0000026UV|5.0|Too often great guitar players have little (or nothing) to say. This can cause uneven lyrics in their work. That is certainly not the case here. Buy this not for the great guitar playing and mutual talent and admiration, buy it for the lyrics. The guitar playing is your bonus for your excellent taste. Most of this is (much) lighter than other Mark Knopfler offerings the rich descriptions are still here with a well ensconced tongue-in-cheek. I was just as happy to pay for it as they both (obviously) were to create it. I want my Chet/Mark TEEVEE!
B00006IM9Q|5.0|I needed some Blondie really badly, and I wanted to update my vinyl copy of their album Parallel Lines to CD. After searching and listening to clips here on Amazon though, I decided to get this compilation instead. The only song I miss is Fade Away and Radiate, all of my other favorite songs are here. I chose this CD based on my use of Amazon's Listen to Samples function. The sound quality of this CD was far better than the sound quality of Parallel Lines in the samples of songs that I listened to. I can't stop listening to this CD, it's brilliant.
0783231032|5.0|An excellent comedy from speilberg not well received at the time of original release lots of subtle jokes to advanced for the time for many people but still great now very enjoyable for those who like python, austin powers, naked gun, airplane, Mel Brooks, and the simpsons, some of the jokes you need a background in movie history and american tv sitcoms from 60's and 70's to get the jokes. but still a forgotten comedy cult movie.!
B000AXSN5G|5.0|I haven't bought this CD yet -- but will as soon as I finish writing this review.  Having just seen the movie, I can only say that this is one of those magically - divinely? - inspired musical moments.  At 56, I'm slightly younger than Young and his friends and musicians who put on this concert in Nashville.  Neil's song to his 21 year old daughter (mine is 22) made me weep and smile at the same time.  His tributes to Hank and his own 'daddy' were, well, 'golden hearted.'  Neil, at this point in our lives, the 'road behind us' is longer than the one ahead -- but I hope for my sake, that the road ahead for you is as long as possible. P. S. The kid behind the ticket counter asked me my age.  I said \\"61.\\"  He offered -- and I accepted -- the 'senior discount.'
B000E8N690|5.0|THIS WAS A REALLY GOOD MOVIE FROM START TO FINISH. I WATCHED PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, NORTH COUNTRY, AND NOW THIS ONE, AND OUT OF THE 3 I'VE SEEN THIS MOVIE PASSES IT BY FAR. I THINK JOAQUIN PHIONEX AND REESE WITHERSPOON SHOULD WIN THE OSCAR, THAT THEY'RE NOMINATED FOR ,B/C THEIR PERFORMANCE WAS FLAWLEES, AND BRILLIANT.  <br /> <br />I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT JOHNNY CASH BEFORE WATCHING THIS MOVIE, AND ITS A GREAT STORY ABOUT LOVE AND WHAT FAME CAN DO TO YOU, BELIVING IN YOURSELF...WATCH IT AND YOU'LL LOVE IT
006056251X|4.0|\\"Devil in Winter\\" is the much anticipated third book in Lisa Kleypas' Wallflower series, a group of books about four upper-class Victorian-era friends who band together in their quest for suitable husbands.  The heroine of \\"Devil in Winter\\" is Evangeline Jenner, the flame-haired, painfully shy daughter of notorious London gaming club owner Ivo Jenner (a secondary character in Kleypas' wonderful book \\"Dreaming of You\\".)  The hero is Sebastian, Lord St. Vincent, last seen at the end of \\"It Happened One Autumn\\" brooding over his failed attempt to kidnap and forcibly wed another Wallflower, the lively American heiress, Lillian Bowman.  If you love the Gorgeous, Hardened Rake Reformed By the Awkward, Innocent Virgin storyline, this is the book for you.  If you were hoping for something a little bit darker and edgier based upon Sebastian's somewhat morally ambiguous character in \\"It Happened One Autumn\\", you may be slightly disappointed.  <br /> <br />The story is set up as a Marriage of Convenience plot, with the (previously) timid, stuttering heiress Evie approaching gorgeous, financially-strapped libertine Sebastian with an offer of marriage.  Evie is desperate to escape from her abusive, overbearing maternal relatives in order to nurse her ailing, consumptive father through his final days.  Viewing marriage as her only option and realizing that Sebastian is in desperate need of money, Evie proposes an elopement to Gretna Green and Sebastian sardonically agrees to the plan.  Evie's bargain involves consummation of the marriage to make it legal, but no lovemaking after the first night (Ha! As if!!!)   <br /> <br />During their road trip to Scotland for the elopement, the couple begins to bond and (rather unwillingly) to develop feelings for each other.  The Sebastian in \\"Devil in Winter\\" is a much kinder, gentler version of the terminally selfish, charming, indolent, and amoral rake from \\"It Happened One Autumn\\".  He spends a lot of time nurturing Evie--supplying her with warm bricks for her feet and even brushing her teeth and tucking her into bed!  Evie's stutter almost completely disappears by Chapter 2 (supposedly because she feels so \\"comfortable\\" with sarcastic, sinfully attractive and seductive Sebastian.) The inner strength and determination beneath her shyness is revealed (no surprises here.) Sebastian, former heartless lover of hundreds of women, begins to (rather inexplicably IMO) develop a grand passion for sweet, awkward Evie.  Evie is worried that Sebastian will break her heart if she allows herself to care about him, so she attempts to hold him at arm's length; however, she finds herself depending upon him more and more once they return to London and her father's gaming club where the formerly indolent Sebastian becomes quite a workaholic. There is a subplot with a villainous former employee of the club who wishes to harm Evie and requisite Heroic Rescue by Sebastian.   <br /> <br />The story is well-written and the plot moves along well, particularly considering that it is weighted down by a number of romance cliches.  The secondary characters are interesting and very well done, particularly Cam, the gorgeous, enigmatic half-gypsy croupier at Jenner's gaming club.   <br /> <br />In summary, this is an entertaining (if not particularly ground-breaking) tale of the Reformation of A Hardened Rake by A Sweet Virgin that is sure to please romance readers who love that familiar plot line.  <br />Recommended.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|Loved the CD it has not came out of my CD player since I opened it.
B000088E6D|5.0|I love the voice, I love the style.  Michael delivers these classic songs with style and grace.  Absolutely lovely to listen to.
B000E33VWW|5.0|This is an absolute tour de force by Hoffman.  He absolutely channels Truman Capote, it is just amazing, I really have not seen a better performance..ever.   This is not an easy guy to nail down, I know Hoffman was scared to death of this part, he knew he could be seen as a characture, but he is fabulous.  The movie itself is as good as Hoffman's performance, Keener does a wonderful job as Truman's best friend Harper Lee, she is his sounding board.  Hoffman's is such a nuanced performance and it is so interesting to watch Capote get eaten up by his own ambition, you can see in Hoffman's face a man who knows deep down what an empty vessel he is, all he wants is fame and he will stoop to any level to receive it.  The scene at the end where Capote tearfully tells the killers as they are about to go to their death that he did all he could to save them, it is so sincere, yet at the same time sooo insincere, he's such a manipulator, I think even Capote believes it for a minute. I highly recommend this film, it's a career performance by Hoffman, you'll be blown away.
B000059HAI|4.0|I saw this movie at the theatre many years ago, but recently had the opportunity to view it again at my daughter's home.  My son-n-law is a fanatic regarding history, especially dealing with the different wars involving America. <br />I really feel this movie presented the Japanese side , to the best ability of the non-Japanese.  Of course, at this juncture who can really say just what went through the minds of those  higher-ups when they made that fateful decision...
B00009W0U4|4.0|A little roughie! <br />This gem, caused up a bit of a stir becuase of the rape scene which admittedly went on a bit long - but that was the point was it not - to make us uncomfortable. The story is told backwards, with cool cinematography, motion control cameras all over the place and documentary realistic type shooting. Its nihilistic and downbeat for sure, buts its also powerful and highly disturbing piece of cinema. <br /> <br />But be prepared if you are not used to these movies you wont like it, but a really well produced and ballsy movie! <br /> <br />recommended for strong stomachs and strong minds :-)
B0002TT0NW|4.0|Little kids will probably  be scared, but other than that the film is highly entertaining.  There's enough of a story to engage adults.  The action and special effects are also enough to hold the kids attention.  Star Wars was the fantasy of choice when I was growing up.  Since the recent SW series has been mediocre, the HP series is a great choice.
B000002H5I|5.0|It's a treat to sit back and to listen to her music. Tracy Chapman sings a story of life in each track. It is about life - the ups and downs, and presented in a musical form that's both earthy and pleasant to hear.
630460288X|5.0|Loved this movie always have.  Make's me feel 19 all over again!! <br />Taco Bell and Schwarzenegger as president is just priceless.  A must have.
B000957O82|5.0|The movie will have you rolling.  All in all, it's a pretty clean movie.  As for the extra features, they're pretty good.  The deleted scenes are interesting, but the blooper reel is kinda lame.  It's worth having in your collection
006056251X|5.0|I've read Lisa Kleypas for several years now.  I've really enjoyed the Wallflower series.  First of all, none of the 4 Wallflowers are in the TSTL category.  A big plus for any book.  Even outspoken Lillian has the sense not to rush in to danger that she must then be rescued from because she \\"can take care of herself\\".  Spare me those fools.<br /><br />So far, all 3 heros are the kind you love to love.  I wondered how Ms. Kleypas would make the despicable Sebastian loveable.  I needn't have worried.  He came thru with flying colors.  I just received the book yesterday and stayed up most of the night to read it.  Fortunately for me, I can do that sort of thing these days.<br /><br />Unfortunately for me, I have to wait til who knows when for Daisy's story.  Will the hero be Cam or will it be Matthew?  Stay tuned.<br /><br />My one and only quibble with \\"Devil in Winter\\" is Cam.  Not Cam himself but a tiny gripe about why is he called a boy throughout the club part of the story, it's mentioned that he is 25 years old.  Evie is 2 years younger and yet she thinks of him as a boy.  Personally, I think he's sexy as heck.  If he isn't the hero of \\"Scandal in Spring\\", I sure hope he gets his own story sometime soon.  Definitely hero material.  Sexy is the word there.<br /><br />This book definitely goes into my keeper pile.  Such a satisfying read.  I love how Sebastian learns to love and what a strong woman Evie turns out to be when even her 3 friends think she is delicate.
B000E8N690|3.0|I found myself very interested in the movie, mostly because <br />of the \\"freight train\\" sound of early, rockabilly Cash.  The <br />movie could almost be called \\"Ray II\\" b/c it follows a similiar <br />structure, storyline, and visual style as the Ray Charles flick. The screen writers made the interesting choice of telling Cash's story up to 1968, which overall worked, but does make the movie plod a bit with its 135 minute length (thank god they deleted a ton of scenes at that).  The performances by Phoenix and Witherspoon are as captivating as the music, and overall their love story has intrigue, although it too is a bit drawn out.  Overall, I felt too much time in the heart of the movie was allocated to Cash's drug problem, which heightened the negative feel of the story. Although I realize biographical movies can spread themselves too thin by covering too many aspects/phases of the person's life, I feel this one could've <br />been a bit more dynamic in the approach.  Overall, the storyline was too focused on his failed marriage, pill  <br />habit, and love for June.  I felt I didn't learn or experience as much as I could have.  However, overall I'd recommend the movie and the performances, especially for the toe-tappers out there.
B000002BE9|5.0|This winter I bought my second copy of this CD to replace a theft last year.<br />I consider it money well spent. Although this album was released as Rock and the scorchingly sexy video that was responsible for so much flack on MTV, this album is really more piano based Jazz for me, it's moody it's broody, it's sexy, it's sad, it's brilliant, it's poignant, and it's powerful. Sadly, she hasn't matched its beautiful ferocity in her later albums. But I continue to buy them, as I think she is too important as an artist to let fade away.<br />I just hope I don't have to wait as long for a fourth as for the third, and that Number four returns Miss Apple to the sensual smooth, heart rending masterpiece music that is found on this great Album. If not, I would welcome a Live album of her masterful covers, like Use Me and Angel, both better than the Original.
B0002KQNJU|5.0|Hilarious spoof of vampire films, particularly towards the Hammer Studio versions, director Roman Polanski also wrote and starred, proving his versatility. He plays Alfred, assistant of Professor Abronsius (Jack MacGowran), a vampire \\"killer\\" (before \\"slayer\\" came into vogue). They arrive in an isolated Slovianian village, having been informed of a presence of a bloodsucking cult. After meeting the voluptuous Sarah (Sharon Tate), the daughter of the innkeeper (Alfie Bass), the young assistant is smitten, and, in true Polanski vision, becomes mildly obsessed and voyeuristic. While on their hunt, Alfred witnesses Jewish vampire Count von Krolock (Ferdy Mayne) attack the comely maiden in her bubble bath, and whisk her away to his castle. Alfred and Abronsius pursue him, and in an elaborate attempt to rescue Sarah from being initiated into the cult, they pose as members during a sort of \\"dawn of the dead\\" ball with a wonderful mirror sequence. To complicate matters, the count's gay son, Herbert (Iain Quarrier, priceless) develops a crush on the young Alfred. Humorous, enjoyable farce; try for Polanski's original cut at 107 min; beware the American shortened theatrical versions - one runs 98 min; they do not do it justice. Sharon Tate is gorgeous and funny in her bathing scenes; it was during this film's production that she and Polanski began their passionate if short-lived relationship.
B0009S2T0M|4.0|Well i read a bunch of articles about the movie, they all described the movie as great. The truth is that it's not a great movie, but it's a pretty good one. The story is kind of original (it's a pretty good story)however it's not developed as well. What i really liked about it was the style. Lighting, and stuff like that is really good. With a little more suspense it would've been a great movie.
6304698623|5.0|I can't stop raving about this movie!!!! There are so many things that touch my heart and make me cry. The fact that young Sara remains so optimistic and kind throughout her ordeal is enough to recommend the film (and the book). Liam Cunnigham is so handsome and gentle as her father, who adores his only and motherless child the way all children want to be loved. And the \\"curse\\" put on the snobby Lavinia is priceless!!! They could not have chosen a better child actress to play Sara. Liesel Matthews embodies her character so well that you forget that she's acting. The fantasy sequences are glorious to look at, and the little girls at the school are adorable in their uniforms. Eleanor Bron is superb as Ms. Minchen. You just love to hate her. This movie should be watched with \\"The Secret Garden\\" (1993). Both are timeless, touching, and beautiful masterpieces. Share it with your children and your inner child. Remember 'Every girl everywhere is a princess.' Need I say more?
B00000373U|5.0|Nothing to say that hasn't been said before, but yes, a very good CD from the most talented singer/songwriter of the 90's. <br /> <br />Alameda/Rose Parade are amazing.
6305428050|5.0|This is still one of my all-time favorites. I recently bought the DVD, and I've watched it several times since. Okay, it's not exactly realistic, but it's not intended to be. That's the whole point, so don't be afraid to indulge!!! It really takes you back to your teen years, especially if you ever babysat and wished for some excitement instead of boredom. Chris Parker (a marvellous Elisabeth Shue) is a beautiful high school senior who was anticipating celebrating with her boyfriend, Mike (Bradley Whitford) regarding their anniversary. However, the jerk (as the viewers know) stands her up with some really lame excuse and she ends up babysitting for the Andersons, who have a very curious and adorable daughter, Sara, (Maia Brewton) and a teenage son, Brad, (Keith Coogan, grandson of the great Jackie Coogan) who secretly makes puppy eyes at Chris. Brad's obnoxious best friend, Daryl (Anthony Rapp) shows up and wants in when Chris receives a frantic phone call from her best friend, Brenda (a wonderfully comedic Penelope Ann Miller), who has run away from home, only to be stranded at a downtown Chicago bus stations with some really pricelessly goofy characters. Our heroine dares to take the rugrats with her to rescue her pal, and they encounter one outrageous adventure after another. In the process, they blow a tire, meet up with an amputee truck driver, witness an assault, end up being dragged down to a automobile heisting operation, chased by the bad guys, singing in a blues club (one of the best sequences), come between a gang war on a subway, crash (almost literally) a frat party, and discover that Chris's guy has been two-timing her with an \\"easy chick\\", and end up at the Anderson's party downtown. And they do, finally accomplish their mission to rescue Brenda, while trying to beat the progenetors home!!! Whew!!! No wonder Chris decides that this is going to be her first and last job!!!! The 60s soundtrack does nothing to hurt the film, in fact, it enhances it, especially the opening track, \\"He Kissed Me\\" by the Crystals. (A moment that every girl dreams about). The situations are hilarious, with as always, the charmingly clueless yuppie parents, funny villains, and resourceful protagonists. I applauded when Daryl returned a long overdue favor to Mike in the French restaurant, and the facial expression on Daryl's face on the freeway when they are approached by \\"Handsome\\" John Pruitt just takes the cake!!! And that George Newburn, as college guy Dan, is such a cutie!!! Vincent D'Orinifo's appearance is notable as well. Fun, fun fun!!!! \\"Oh, gee, Daryl, are you a gear-head and a sex fiend?\\" A laugh riot!!!cially the opening track, \\"He Kissed Me\\" by the Crystals. (A moment that every girl dreams about).

B00005MP58|5.0|Other favorable reviews have made points that I agree with. The film is an excellent study in comparative personalities, the humor sneaks up on you, and I have watched my mate's version with her several times through. It doesn't wear out. I add that the music written is so appropriate, complementing the story. <br />I recommend it to my macho friends. There's a lot to learn about yourself by watching it several times.
0307276902|4.0|A must read for anyone who has known an addict. The book gives insight into the turmoil and self destruction of the addict/alcoholic. Even if Frey had embellished on some parts,  it still sent the message.
0380713802|5.0|This book  is by no means meant to be a typical travel guide.  This is more like a memoir of sorts.  A memoir of a guy trying to relive an adventurous part of his youth, before he sells out to a middle aged mundane life.  In stead of getting details about where to stay, where to eat, what to see... you get an impression.  To me, this was vastly more interesting than a list of who-what-where.  <br /> <br />You hear snippets of Katz... well, read A Walk in the Woods to learn more about Bryson's friend, reminds me of Seinfeld's Kramer.   To Bryson's credit, he doesn't try to polish his story, or try to make himself out as anything he is not. He just tells it like it is.   If anything, Bryson encourages armchair tourists to get out and live a little.
006056251X|5.0|I don't believe I have ever anticipated a book more than I did Devil in Winter, and the reality exceeded all my expectations. St. Vincent is the most amazing character Lisa Kleypas has every created (and there is some substantial competition for that title in her extraordinary catalogue of heroes).  And Evie is his perfect match in all ways - so very much substance beneath that shy exterior.  St. Vincent grows and changes without losing any of the devilish charm that made us love him in the first place.   Buy this book.  Buy a copy for your sister and your best friend (and don't lend it to them because they are never going to give it back).
0385720920|2.0|I'll sum up my thoughts like this: <br /> <br />in the annals of med school, I'd hazard a guess that noone who ever got in ever used the phrase \\"for serious\\" when they meant \\"seriously\\" or \\"for real.\\"  This phrase stopped me dead in my tracks every time Victor used it, and it seemed stupid. <br /> <br />Plus, every guy gets sexually rejected once in their lives by a woman ... except Victor. <br /> <br />This is a slightly below-average throwaway novel.  Meh.
B0002OXVDW|5.0|Classic movie lovers can now have their cake and eat it too!  This has got to be some of the best clips from movies, and some of the cut scenes too!  There will always be the numbers never filmed, and those lost, and those not found yet, or hidden.  But this has probably got to be the most exhaustive collection of dance numbers from those old movies ever put together.  The price is pretty cheap, and the collection is enormous!<br /><br />  This is a definite must for anyone that enjoys the classics with Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, Eleanor Powell, Gene Kelly, Ann Miller, etc.  And a good way to show those that have never seen those movies the best ever put out on film.

B000EGF0QY|5.0|It's as simple as this:  if you are going to purchase one David Sedaris book (I would highly recommend more than one), this is the one to get.  I laughed more at Me Talk Pretty One Day than any other book I've read. Ever. My wife highly recommended it to me and I'm glad she did.  I read a fair amount, but rarely humor; in print, it just doesn't translate well for me usually.  However, MTPOD had me laughing constantly, as hard as any live stand-up comedian, comedy (movie or play, audio recording, joke at the office, etc. might induce.  This is a book to read regardless what you usually read. It's top shelf regardless of your preferences.  Just buy it.  You're wasting time. <br /> <br />- Charles
078401213X|4.0|I must really commend the guys who put \\"Pi\\" together in that the subject matter is quite interesting.  There were parts of the story that became obscured in the editing (I suspect) such as the role of the beautiful neighbor (Shekinah?) and it is never clear why our hero's double was standing opposite him on the subway platform with a bloody hand -- at that point, it became more of an self-concious artschool style film instead of focusing upon telling a story.  The use of music in the film was almost a complete waste, it just did not work well.  The creators needed to incubate this more, IMHO.  I enjoyed the film best when it was telling a story, especially without the use of special effects. <br /> <br />Still, it is an interesting film to see.
0743454529|5.0|Jodi Picoult's book My Sister's Keeper touched my heart.  This story is a poignant tale of love, loss, forgiveness and redemption.  This story is definitely one that will spark intense conversations long after the book is finished.  This story is about a young girl (Anna) whose lone reason for survival is for her sister (Kate).  Kate was diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukemia.  Anna was conceived in a petri dish to be an exact sibling match for a bone marrow transplant.  Because Anna is a perfect sibling match anytime Kate's health deteriorates and needs leukocytes, stem cells, or blood marrow Anna donates them.  When Kate is 16 her kidney begins to fail and for her survival she needs Annas'.  Anna makes a decision that tears the family apart when she decides that she does not want to give her up kidney.  This story is told with an intertwining timeline and each chapter is actually one of the character's speaking from their point of view.   We don't hear Kate's side of the story until the last few pages, which adds to the suspense of the novel.  I highly recommend this book and suggest one reads this with a box of Kleenex nearby.
0920668372|5.0|Joey from Friends can make you cry when he reads this. The only part that is slightly creepy is when Mom drives across town to see her adult son in the middle of the night. The message is sweet, though - that your baby will be your baby no matter how old they are.
B000002L9J|5.0|Twenty years after disbanding, The Smiths are still an important force in music. How do I know? In fact, \\"I am a living sign.\\" Last summer, I heard my first Smiths song, and my life changed completely. Like many people, I was initially interested, but not blown away. But as soon as I purchased one of their albums, I fell in love. <br />The Queen is Dead was my third Smiths album. It's no Hatful of Hollow, but it's still absolutely wonderful. I can see where others may not enjoy the work of Morrissey; with his theatrical vocals and air of gloom, he is, perhaps, and acquired taste. But it is my supposition that any who write off Morrissey as a mediocre lyricist have questionable taste. Morrissey is, in truth, a lyrical genius. His use of paradox, figuritve language, and ryhme is astounding. More than once I have been unable to express my pure thoughts and emotions, only to find that Morrissey had already said exactly what I wanted to in one of his songs.  <br />Most songs on this album are memorable, though \\"Some Girls...\\" is probably the weakest. Personal favourites of mine include \\"Cemetry Gates,\\" an absolute classical, the bitingly critical title track, and the oddly catchy \\"Never had no-one ever.\\" <br />This is not the greates album the Smiths produced, but it's certainly the one with the largest social and cultural impact. Anyone who wants to understand the evolution of post-punk music definately needs to check this out.
6305161879|5.0|\\"A Fish Called Wanda\\" is a hilarious comedy which brings out some of the cardinal vices in people including avarice, murder, lust, envy, greed and revenge. The cast is excellent and the movie is fun throughout.<br /><br />The story starts with four people engaged in a jewellery robbery. The four, George (Tom Georgeson), sexy Wanda (Jamie Leigh Curtis), the stammering animal loving hit man Ken (Michael Palin) and Wanda's brother Otto (Kevin Kline) all want the loot for themselves. From this, an excellent plot is woven into a brilliant and exceptional comedy that is among my favourites of all time.<br /><br />George finds himself in prison, betrayed by his accomplices. The conservative lawyer, Archie Leach (John Cleese) has the duty to defend George. However, he is mesmerised and seduced by Wanda, resulting in him compromising his professionalism and getting deeply mired in the mess.<br /><br />When you are feeling down and need something to uplift or cheer you up, this DVD will do the trick.
0340838035|5.0|I love this book. It is so hard for me to put it down. I find it to be real written and the novel keeps you interested. I love how she goes back and forth between \\"then\\" and \\"now.\\" It allows you to get to know the characters better and to understand their friendships. I look forward to read the rest of this novel and other novels by Jodi Picoult.
B00008DDSC|5.0|\\"Secretary\\" is an excellent if eccentric romantic story (so to speak) where the main actors, Lee and Mr Grey, played their delicate roles exceptionally well, particularly for Lee in this her first starring role.<br /><br />Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a nervous, frustrated, aimless, innocent and vulnerable lady who had recently been released from a mental institution. She has a very low self-esteem and an eccentric habit of inflicting pain on herself. After her release from mental institution, she acquires a secretarial qualification and gets a job at the law firm of E. Edward Grey. Mr Grey (James Spade) is an imperious and perfectionist lawyer. He employs Lee, who stirs dark and shameful urges in him. Mr Grey is a sadist who believes in sexual dominance. He subjects Lee to spanking for minor typing errors which, strangely enough she enjoys. There is natural chemistry between these two unusual characters. Ironically, although Mr Grey is supposed to be the dominant character, it is in fact Lee that exercises immense power on her employer. He in fact needs and desires her desperately.<br /><br />Some people may find the film disturbing and shocking with an apparently vulnerable lady at the mercy of a fussy and sadistic boss with kinky sexual desires. The submissive character of Lee may present her as someone deserving of protection. Most normal people may find the relationship between Lee and Mr Grey very weird and perhaps unreal, being a fictional creation of Hollywood. However, for those that are open minded and enjoy dark humour, the film should be of a lot of interest. It may also enlighten people that indeed S & M does exist and this brings originality into the film.
0385486804|4.0|Into the Wild is an exhilarating story about the life of a disturbed young man. Jon Krakauer takes his readers through the mind of Chris McCandless, whose ultimate goal is to become independent from the rest of the world. Krakauer uses McCandless's diary and interviews of people who met this inspiring man along the way in order to piece together this remarkable journey. Readers know how the story ends by reading the front cover. However, Krakauer takes an interesting approach in comparing McCandless to others including Krakauer himself. Into the Wild is a powerful account of a man who walks into the wilderness of Alaska but never walks out. <br />  <br />Into the Wild can be an appealing book to any reader. Although many criticize that McCandless was just another ignorant man who thought he could survive in the Alaskan wilderness without the necessary tools and equipment, no one can fully understand the knowledge and wisdom he had. His diary and friends tell the real story. McCandless was experiencing what it was like to live \\"off the chart.\\" He had every reason to do so. Many readers can benefit from reading this book. Each chapter is filled with fascinating quotes by people who don't like to live the real world. Readers will be able to understand that people like McCandless are not insane but rather smart. How they choose to carry out their dreams is where everything goes wrong. It is near impossible to live in a fantasy world with the society we live in today. <br />  <br />Jon Krakauer has written many chilling accounts that deal with the complexity of the mind. As author of Into Thin Air and Under the Banner of Heaven, Krakauer has the experience of portraying what goes on inside one's head. The book flows from one point to another. Inspirational quotes at the beginning of every chapter give the reader a chance to reflect about what just happened or to think about what is going to happen. Krakauer stops at nothing to bring his readers the truth about Chris McCandless. If you have read either of the two books above, then Into the Wild is worth reading.  <br />
B00028HBKM|5.0|**update 2015**<br />Since I first left this review in 2006, it is now a tradition to watch this every Easter. It's a great reminder of His story.<br /><br />=================<br /><br />I've ignored this movie for the last two years due to the amount of good and bad publicity/discussion around it. It just didn't interest me at the time.<br /><br />So here I am in the library and see it on the shelf and I decide to pick it up and watch it as a filler for when my Netflix rentals are delayed for whatever reason.<br /><br />I'm still speechless as this thought-proving movie left me with an appreciation for what the Lord our Christ did for us. The point of the movie is in the title of the movie: The point of Christ's life was to die for mankind and rise again and thus fulfill the plan of God the Father as laid out in the Scriptures.<br /><br />The means, his beating and crucifixion, was Christ's passion as a deity wanting to demonstrate an unbound love for his creation, even when his human side (our human side) desired to satisfy and protect the self instead.<br /><br />The passion is so well portrayed in this movie that I'm left with a deep awe as to what is such a well known &#34;story&#34; and left with the implications of what if it is all true? What if Christ is the true God who came as a man to die and rise again to give us a choice. . .to give us the opportunity to take our cruel, self-serving ways and now have an avenue to approach a God that is without blemish?<br /><br />What if I choose to grasp the fact that the story of the crucifixion is much more than a historical account of an innocent man receiving the death penalty? What if I truly understand that though things aren't always obvious or visible (as demonstrated with the Satan and demon scenes of the movie) that Jesus was more than a man, that more was at stake in the battle between Good vs. Evil and that fulfilling a destiny at the cost of self is the greatest act of love, mercy, heroism and everything noble that we should all strive to be more like?<br /><br />To watch such a well directed and well acted movie that has the focus of changing lives can't but leave me dumbstruck.

B00005MP58|2.0|I'm torn in this review.  The CD/video is undoubtedly the best interpretation of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\".  The actors, screenplay, and overall excellence of the production are unparalled.  However, I am asked to rate this item.  I had the full video set which I watched many times (comfort time).  When I got my first DVD I was very unhappy with the reproduction.  The colors, which were vivid on the video, were washed out, reds being pale, etc.  I thought that that was one mistake so I ordered another and then another, all the same.  I can hardly watch the CD's.  The story remains wonderful, but the CD is miserable, and I have watched the original enough to hate watching the CD.  Order at your own risk--the production is A class, the reproduction stinks.

6304826133|1.0|Cop Land  The film starts by showing some off-duty cops. One drives away, and is struck by a speeding car. When he tries to get them to pull over, they point a long barrel object at him. This officer fires some shots at the fleeing car, it crashes, and both occupants are dead. Drugs are found in the car, but no weapon (or so it seems).     Next we see the Freddy, the Sheriff of \\"Garrison NJ\\", across the river from New York City, handling small town problems. Many NYC cops chose to live in this small town. Some of them share a secret scandal. There are interpersonal conflicts among them. Internal Affairs is searching around to find that missing cop, who seems to have gone off a bridge. [Can you believe this?] The Sheriff wants to know what is going on in his town. The missing policeman is a liability to his friends who are hiding him; so they try to eliminate this problem. [Can you believe this?]    The policeman who went into hiding escaped from his friends and co-workers, and shows up at Freddy's house; but he needs to run off again! So Freddy goes to visit the IA detective and tell what happened. But his information is rejected! [Can you believe this?] So now the story changes tone and Freddy begins his own investigation. But the rogue cops are aware and warn him off. And so the story plods on to its ending, when the good guys finally win.    There are no \\"Sheriffs\\" in any small town in NJ, that is an elective county office. \\"Police Chief\\" is the correct title, and they are appointed by the local politicians. I think those wide-brimmed hats are to be found only west of the Delaware. These campaign hats are a relic of the 19th century militia. Bergen County is located across from New York, its many small town could be a site like \\"Garrison\\". Really \\"Fort Lee\\"? I don't know why Hollywood avoids any such story about a locale on the West Coast. Too close to home?
B00008BRB5|2.0|If I had known that this SACD was only a 2 channel SACD, I would not have even bothered.  <br /> <br />Playing the original CD in all channel mode sounds better than this pile.  <br /> <br />Man, after listening to (my only other SACDs, so far) Joe Satriani's Strange Beautiful Music, and the 30 year anniversary hybrid SACD of Dark Side of the Moon, (both amazing in 6 channel SACD) this was a huge letdown. <br /> <br />I like the album a lot, and am a big fan of The Police, but if you already have the original CD, THERE IS NO REASON to buy this thing, the better sampling rate doesn't help it a bit (get it?... hehehe).  <br /> <br />Call The Police, I've been ripped-off.  <br /> <br />!!!!!SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!
B0000CDL3W|2.0|The action is so mechanical and extreme as to amount to a parody of the earlier films. Violent action is no substitute for a good story. Scenes with mechanical machines going wild are implausible. But they provide a car chase like you're never seen before. Could that truck have so much kinetic energy to do that much damage and keep on moving? NO, you would need a freight train. The petite young blond terminatrix seems like a match for the Terminator. (Is this some kind of feminist message or a retelling of Genesis?) <br /> <br />This film seems like a down-market version of the earlier films. The \\"network down\\" events suggest a fragility of modern life unknown in the past. The flight to the countryside reminds me of the actions of people during medieval plagues. When there is dialogue, as at the mausoleum, it is not first rate. \\"Don't do that.\\" The special effects are certainly better than in the earlier films. The shape imitation in this film recalls the old horror films (like \\"The Wolfman\\"). What is original about this film? <br /> <br />Next we learn that \\"Judgment Day\\" will occur in a few hours. Nuclear war will wipe out most people! There is a philosophical question in this film. Can the future affect the past? Orwell's \\"1984\\" said those who control the present control the future. But only in a fantasy can the future control the past. Those are just idealistic terms, the past is always gone. The present always determines the future, even if we don't understand how. <br />
0060594888|5.0|I listened to The Successs Principles online seminar of Jack's and liked it so much I decided to buy this book.  This is a long book, but well worth the time.  It's split in 4 sections, and each areas contains several principles, making it an easy book to navigate.  I liked the mix of real-world success stories (from others and Jack's own), excellent quotes, and hard-nosed advice about what works.  If you're going to keep this book in your library, then this isn't the book for you -- it should be kept on your desk where you can refer to it daily, ear-mark your favorite pages, &lt;span color=\\"yellow\\">highlight moving passages&lt;/span>, and spill your coffee on it while you read and re-read Jack's suggestions.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|Lady and the Tramp-its that magical movie that I have loved since I was little (I'm only 13 here). I always thought the movie had everything. Drama, Romance, Comedy, you name it! I absolutly love the orchestra and the music (Peggy Lee is one of my all time favorite singers, so she gives the songs a fresh taste, unlike many Disney flicks). I think the animation of Lady and the Tramp is stunning still to this very day! Yes, aside from how much I love this film, Disney finally released this masterpiece on their Platium Collection line featuring enhanced audio and sound plus the best digital restoration you could possibly have! I very much enjoyed watching the movie in its original widescreen format (since I owned the cruddy VHS with full screen). Watching the whole movie again just overjoyed me so much!  <br /> <br />Even though I had a blast watching it, there was one downside. <br /> <br />In Bella Notte, when the choir is singing the song, they took out the beautiful orchestra and made the choir accapella. I thought it kind of ruined the whole scene (heck, it does always make you want to cry!) <br /> <br /> <br />Bonus Feature wise, Virtual Puppy didn't work on my sister's computer but it worked on mine (the game is a little addicting). We were a little dissapointed that Peg wasn't put in one of the puppies to adopt! lol. The board game was a little irritating because you HAVE to have seen all of these movies to play. I love all of the behind the scenes rare footage!  <br /> <br />This DVD is a must have for anyone! Its a classic! The Greatest Disney movie of all time. <br />
0977326403|5.0|While some people (e.g. Drucker) already understand that the social sector cannot be managed or evaluated by traditional business principles, it is nice to see that someone is testing this premise.  Although Collins' work is far from complete, he begins to define a language and framework for looking at how capacity can be built and maintained in non-profits.
B0000062S0|4.0|Yes, Page and Plant are older.  Yes, the sound is more mature and less \\"bombastic\\" as another reviewer described Zep's sound.  But the music itself stands on its own. <br /> <br />There are many excellent songs on this CD, all burning with emotion, lyrical depth (if understated delivery), and less reliance on fretboard wizardry.  \\"Shining in the Light,\\" \\"When the World Was Young,\\" \\"Blue Train,\\" \\"Most High,\\" \\"When I Was a Child,\\" are all fantastic.  There is an attempt to recapture the magic, but the songs are organic in that they are honest efforts and not an attempt to rely on former glories. <br /> <br />Page's efforts are showcased best in the songwriting.  His soloing is not at the same level as it once was...there are only one or two instances on this record where he hits a relevant target.  He doesn't try often, and the songs don't suffer.  To be honest, when he does try it is sometimes painful.  Plant's voice has not been the same since Led Zeppelin IV and his singing is similar to that of his other solo efforts.  Still, he reaches the emotional depth and delivers comperably excellent pitch, if not the range of his early 20's. <br /> <br />I rediscovered this CD this month, after it sat on the shelf since I bought it right after its release.  I now like it a lot, enough to wholeheartedly recommend it. <br /> <br />
B0009UC7HA|3.0|Similar to National Treasure.  No blood or cussing just a good old plain adventure story.  Nothing new here.  Same old Hollywood formula.  I would suggest NT over this.  Great to watch with the kids and if the kids are not home then watch Indiana Jones again.

B000060MWU|2.0|About as comprehensible as one expects a David Lynch movie to be, but not completely unwatchable (I finsihed it!). <br /> <br />Robert Blake appears to have been made up to look like Lugosi doing Dracula (sans cape). This is perhaps intended to be a clue to something or other.  <br /> <br />The best thing about this movie is its soundtrack. In turn, the best part of the soundtrack is This Mortal Coil (with Elizabeth Fraser's chastely sensuous voice) performing a haunting cover of Tim Buckley's \\"Song to the Siren.\\" Predictably, it's missing from the soundtrack album.

Or \\"The Ten Thousand Strings of Baden-Baden Play Slayer.\\" <br /> <br />Further demonstration of the thesis that, for every tacky pop mega-hit in America, there's something just as popular in Europe that's at least as trashy. <br /> <br />This album gets as much as three stars because it has a certain novelty appeal, and because (as somebody sometime said about something else) it might be okay after about six beers. <br />
B000E8QVWY|3.0|Rarely has a biopic film made such a racket at the box office. After viewing the DVD version of WALK THE LINE the reasons for that success must be attached to some sort of homage to Johnny Cash, an American icon of sorts.  Yes, his life and career are notable - the emergence of a legendary Country Western singer out of the elements of a warped childhood peaked by the accidental death of his older brother whom the father clearly preferred, and the torture of self doubt that haunted a man through an unsuccessful marriage and a thwarted love for fellow Country Western singer June Carter, his descent into alcohol and drugs, and his final victory over his demons - but isn't this the same story we see almost annually about famous stars whose backgrounds seem templates from this same mold?<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix is a fine actor and has the courage to take on a variety of roles, succeeding in them all. And yes, he was able to sound like Johnny Cash (given the fact that even Cash's fans will admit it was not a voice of quality but of message).  Much the same could be said for Reese Witherspoon's tackling successfully the equally mediocre quality voice of June Carter - again it was her sassy style that made her a star, not her voice.  And perhaps that is the reason the writers and director elected to spend most of the screen time on the singing and concerts of Cash and Carter - leaving very little of the story of Cash's life except to outline form between songs.<br /><br />But if you condensed the actual acting time on the screen it falls into the overly familiar family clashes, drunken bouts, weaning off drugs, spats and eventual public displays of feelings that seem to be the formula for this genre of biopic.  Though Phoenix and to an extent Witherspoon do well with the material they are given, does the result merit Oscar attention?  That is up to the voters.  It seems to this viewer that there have been many finer performances by less publicized actors in the smaller films more worthy.  But then what are the Oscars for if not for PR for the movies.  Just not that impressed.  Grady Harp, March 06er films more worthy.  But then what are the Oscars for if not for PR for the movies.  Just not that impressed.  Grady Harp, March 06

B000026FOA|5.0|It took about one hundred listens of each of the great Nick Drake albums (the others being Bryter Layter and Pink Moon) to realize that 'Five Leaves Left' is the strongest of Drakes and amongst the greatest debut albums in music history. <br /> <br />Each track resonates through the listeners soul and the effect is deep and everlasting...they exude serenity, beauty and honesty in a very uniquely 'Drake' way, there is no bitterness or anguish or any real emotion in his vocal execution and I believe that it is his execution along with his rock hard lyrics that sets him above anybody else. <br /> <br />To describe this albums individual tracks can never do it justice, it needs to be listened to...and once listened to- again and again. <br /> <br />Highly recommended  <br />
B00000I07Q|5.0|Bon Jovi is a band that may not be the best one (the best one's were Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones or Pink Floyd), but their record-sales say otherwise. There is perhaps a grain of truth in the notion that half of their audience were teenagers and women and their sucess was soemwhat overrated, as well as that they went big on Jon Bon Jovi's coiffeur and outlook, though. <br />   Nonetheless, I think they truly deserved their overwhealming breakthrough from the 80's offering people catchy, competent and well-ctrafted pop-rock-metal tunes played on and on by the MTV. All in all, that's how metal sounded in the mid-80's (just take Whitesnake or Def Leppard). Personally, I have always been an advocate of this band, turning a blind eye on what other narrow-minded people kept saying about it. Yes, Bon Jovi has made couple of cheesy songs (\\"Always\\") and some both cheesy and too commercial as well (\\"It's my life\\"). \\"It's my life\\" was a cheap trial to break to the pop-charts, but, if there are any open-minded music passionates there, you will notice that other bands had it as well (Van Halen had \\"Jump\\", KISS had \\"I was made for loving you\\"). <br />  One has to take the band as a whole, and simply can't deny  the skillful and well-crafted musicanship of albums like \\"New Jersey\\" or \\"Keep the faith\\". So, if you are too narrow-minded to rate this, you simply have no right to proclaim yourself a music-passionate or music-knower.  <br />  \\"New Jersey\\" is undoubtedly Bon Jovi at their peak; simply, that's what BJ is all about. Although it didn't match the blockbuster of 18 million copies sold worldwide (up to this day, I mean), it was a great follow-up to \\"Slippery when wet\\" and nonetheless sold in spades (I guess 7 millions in the US alone in 1988, don't know how much up to this point). It was also the most popular one in Poland at that time, and everyone  that year cuddled and danced to slow, wonderful love ballad \\"I'll be there for you\\". It was a time when Bon Jovi truly had thepower to rule half of the world population. They were just everywhere; \\"straight-in-your face\\", like McDonald's or Coca-Cola.  <br />   \\"New Jersey\\" is much more mature an album, both lyrically and musically. In fact, to my opinion, THIS is the band's best one (better than \\"Slippery\\"). Songs are well-skilled, tuneful and catchy as always, but somehow the integrity of this one is probably the most appealing; in my view the most crafted and detailed in their career. There is absolutely no filler on this album. And, although I personally don't like \\"Bad medicine\\" considering it as one of the few truly cheesy BJ songs, the whole is undeniably amazing. \\"New Jersey\\" produced an amazing 5 Top-ten singles establsihing the band as international superstars and and almost matching the incredible status of its predecessor. Moreover, with the follow-up tour the band comfirmed how well they do on stage. Personally, I would recommend this one to any newcomer who would like to get into Bon Jovi for their music; and to any sceptic who is, pitifully, too narrow-minded to open for different musical genres. <br />   It starts with a great kicking hard-rocker \\"Lay your hands\\", through cheesy \\"Bad medicine\\", just to launch the album's magic for good with \\"Born to be my baby\\" and \\"Living in sin\\" - all of these Billboard Top-ten singles. The second part is, in my view, arguably even better. Truly heavy, hard (almost heavy-metal) \\"Homebound train\\"; the ultimate number one ballad all across the world, \\"I'll be there for there for you\\" and \\"Stick to your guns\\" are beyond doubt everything what the Bon Jovi-phenomenon from the 80's was all about; while \\"Wild is the wind\\" is one of the best songs in the music history that have ever been recorded (it's a pity it wasn't a single). Simply, the entire album clearly depicts the band's success, containing widely-appealing, competent pop-rock-metal material that is so much fun and so much entertaining. Please, do not get me wrong: I am very open-minded and have no doubt this was a commercial band, and there is no use in comparing it to Pink Floyd or Led Zeppelin. But in what they did, they were the best.  <br />This is a must-have. <br /> <br />Please read my other BJ reviews.
0141182504|4.0|Camuses book 'The Outsider' follows in a very vivid and simple style the life of Meursault, whilst wearing the spectacles of a society 64 years previous the book has as much significance today as it did then. Just over 100 pages of carefully crafting western society and the morals and laws that underpin everybodies lives...the legal constraints the tabloid lines taken through the eyes of one man...whether protagonist or hero young Meursault is still an 'open verdict' today.

B0002EQ7EC|5.0|This CD is by far Paul Simon's best CD in every way.  To me, it is my most favorite CD ever. I must admit, the first time I heard it back in 1991, I didn't like it, but I had it in my music collection and one day a few months later I took it back off my shelf because even though I didn't think I liked it, something resonated in me about it.  After giving it another chance, I started to see the true genious of Paul Simon in his philosopical and spiritual nature.  It comes through in this album more than any other.  Both his music and his lyrics show a deep connection with the different people and places of Brasil and it is very touching to the soul.  I am American Indian and I am very close in spirit to the tribes of both North, Central, and South America and this album reflects deeply upon some of our common beliefs in subtle ways which I appreciate even more. While listening to this album, I feel transported to South America with the tribes and forests and oceans and it is beautiful. This album consistently gives me renewed hope and a new sense of purpose and commitment to my causes each time I listen to it.  I have been listening to this album for over 15 years now and I have never gotten tired or sick of it.  Each time I listen to it, I still hear something new and I learn something new about life and myself.  I highly recommend this album and I recommend listening to it several times  before you give it any harsh judgment.  There is so much beauty, conviction, philosophy, hope, love, and spirituality offered in both the lyrics and music that it deserves the highest praise any album can receive.  It is by far my most favorite album and it is nothing less than a truly magical masterpiece.  There is nothing else like it out there.  This version is particually wonderful because it contains 4 previously unreleased songs. I love the alternative versions of the songs as they also contain different lyrics and sounds which add even more depth and beauty to this amazing album.

1400031087|4.0|I am the least able person to write this review. I finished reading this book last night but ever since I finished reading, I cant help but deal with a broken heart. The book is truly heartbreaking and touches your soul when you least expect it. I've developed this James Frey induced flu ever since and I just cannot think of anything else but the oblivious heartbreak of a smile it causes me to give in to.<br /><br />James Frey is the most self critical 23 year old.I mean, you just can't beleive how not for one second, he forgets that view of himself. It makes him sound humble,polite and human. He doesnt hide anything from the reader, his paranoia is quite understandable after having spent years addicted to crack,other drugs and alcohol.His character is extreme and that is what I familiarised with. There's either too much of heart or too much of what he calls \\"fury\\" and indifference towards people around him. The introduction of characters in this book and their semi-character flaws are simply very well jotted down.<br /><br />What I loved about the book is the hardcore honesty. I do not know if the word superhuman fits Frey's character but he is one of a kind. His staunch beleif in the absence of a universal faith(God) is something I respect him for. His chaotic dreams, aggressive food eating habits, violent unfriendly side, his smile, his heart, all in all is something beautiful. I also adored how he never mentions the name of the \\"she\\" he refers to all thru out the book at random intervals. I loved how non preachy this book is, it never assumes any superiority over the reader and never imposes anything. It is more like a diary than a book, it's like looking inside another soul.<br /><br />They say that \\"your eyes show the strength of your soul\\"; For some reason James Frey never looks into his own eyes whenever he sees a mirror. I loved the concept, it's quite adaptable,appreciable and likeable, yet real. Awesome.<br /><br />The book contains briefs over the times spent by James Frey inside a habilitation center. I liked how constant the book is, I mean I could get back to it no matter what I was upto and I would remember where I left off. It's realistic to the extent realism seems a tad too scary to swallow. I couldnt help but exceed my smiling limit around the time James is sent some gifts by his brother,Bob Frey.<br /><br />At all times, James Frey is not alone but he feels alone. He had many friends who he'd call now and then but there is something very lonely about him. It's probably this particular trait in him that I familiarise with. In a way, we all are really alone but we never really mention it. Calling this book a tearjerker would be inapt cause it isn't one. It took me a long to figure why he chose the title of the book, it comes later in the book.<br /><br />I can't express the sincere gratitude I feel for having read this emotional epic. I'm not much of a book reader but this book brings out in me a certain steadiness to do one thing James did rather well in this book, it's to \\"hold on\\" Now,before I get any more preachy than I already might sound like, let me just say, I would recommend this book to anyone having an attention span long enough to read a book.<br /><br />P.S  -  A very interesting thing about the book is the lack of punctuations. It adds a rather unapologetic angle to the book and it only adds to the effect the ultimate effect and gravity this book holds over the reader.<br /><br />With Undying Respect,<br />HSAilitation center.

B0009SOFGI|4.0|Consider yourself an Iggy/Stooges fan? If so, then you MUST own a copy of this. The 1st disc is a great remaster of that fine, fine album with loads of clarity and punch.<br /><br />The 2nd disc is a selection of previously unreleased outtakes and alternate versions. Worth the price of admission alone is the almost 7 minute version of `No Fun'. And what a great version it is, too.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I really enjoyed this DVD. The Eagles have produced some of the greatest music ever recorded. One of the new songs on this DVD, Cloudy Days, is beautiful. Glad I purchased this one, will probably be collectors item one day.
B000AMJDHY|1.0|This is not the worst band in the world. Well, they're tied for worst. This band sounds exactly like another band. FALL OUT BOY. Both of these bands have no musical credibility, and are over played radio sell out pop \\"punks\\". I use the term \\"punks\\" lightly, because this is the farthest from punk that I have ever heard. I can't, for the life of me, wonder why they even bothered. They sound exactly like fall out boy. Not just sound either. They also have the retarded 17 word \\"catchy\\" song titles. I still don't get how people can call them catchy. Things with that many words belong in a novel. And the songs themselves are just the icing on the cake. They are somewhat catchy in a few songs, i'll give them that. Aside from the talentless musicianship, trendy fashion crap, similarity to fall out boy, and songs that repeat things so many times you become suicidal, you have a quality punk band. Oh wait, no you don't. This band, really deserves -6 stars for this, but apparently, i'm not allowed to do that. Don't buy this CD, or any other from this talentless and crappy band. I bet you listen to Fall Out Boy too don't you? You make me sick.

0140120416|5.0|First let me say, don't ever buy into those books that are like \\"Learn to Speak Russian Fluently in 4 Days\\".  It will never happen.  If you are truly serious about learning Russian, its going to take time.  I really recommend this book if you are super serious about studying the Russian language.  It breaks down the grammar and alphabet for you so it is really easy to understand.  However, I will say don't let this be your only source for learning Russian.  Be sure to buy other books as well and cross-reference, because some books explain things better than others.  Overall, I recommen getting this book for an easy-to-understand layout of the Russian language!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Okay, gotta chime in that the point of different clothing coming from different times was the point-the eldest Bennet girl would have the newest clothing, with the younger sisters getting hand me downs along the way. The point being, that the dresses weren't meant to fit perfectly as they were usually from an older sister's, and were not necessarily the fashion of the time. And yes, even thin strapped dresses like Miss Bingley's Netherfield Ball were around for that time, and was meant to convey how fashionista forward Miss Bingley was. I mean, come on folks, costume designers for these types of movies aren't picked off the street or something! There's usually a game plan invovled that's more detailed and comprehensive than the average viewer gives them credit for. <br /> <br />But who cares about clothing-this is a great movie. It's entertaining, enjoyable, and allows the Bennets to be seen in a more lively, grounded way as oppossed to the sentimentalized way we are more used to for Austen features. It recalls \\"Persuasion\\" in that sense, another Austen cinematic favorite of mine.

Chayefsky warned of entertainment masquerading as news, corporate meddling, violent reality shows, the tyranny of ratings, foreign ownership of U.S. media -- essentially the strip-mining of what was already a vast wasteland. \\"The vision that the movie displayed so eloquently is alive today,\\" producer Howard Gottfried maintains. \\"TV today has become its own satire,\\" Lumet adds.<br /><br />Disc 1 includes a sober but quite good commentary from Lumet, who focuses on who won what Oscar, why he rehearses actors, and the thinking behind the \\"Network\\" lighting scheme, in which \\"even the camera is corrupted\\" as the movie descends into anarchy.<br /><br />The extra features leadoff on the second disc is a making-of by DVD docu specialist Laurent Bouzereau.

1400079276|5.0|Before KAFKA ON THE SHORE, I had only read some short pieces in VINTAGE MURAKAMI, which struck me as very Raymond Carveresque pieces with slight doses of absurdity and surrealism... interesting, but nothing earth-shaking.<br /><br />KAFKA ON THE SHORE shattered, then far exceeded, my expectations.  The story cuts between Kafka Tamura, a 15-year old boy running away from a strange and unhappy home, and an elderly, mentally disabled man Nakata who can speak to cats.  Kafka strikes me as a rather typical existentialist narrator-- a distant and removed \\"Stranger\\" to his environs-- but the learned and eloquent characters he meets (like Oshima), as well as his inner explorations, provide for fascinating reading.  Nakata's story is more dream-like, with extravagantly surreal episodes like fish raining from the sky, at first leaving the reader unclear as to whether we are in a world of magic or just have an unreliable narrator.<br /><br />This fascinating work is the best I've read for some time, weaving fantastic elements of magic and dreams in while retaining the down-to-earth reality of the characters and straightforward prose that I have come to expect from Japanese authors.  Think magic realism, but more, with more magic AND realism than its predecessors.<br /><br />I can't recommend KAFKA ON THE SHORE highly enough.

B000006NUW|2.0|Someone pointed out in another review that the songs are presented in the original mono versions.  More than that, I also have the Chartbusters (12 cds) Mowtown compilation and in addition some old vinyl recordings, and I have noticed that the actual _mixes_ are not even the same as the original recordings.  For instance, on Stevie Wonder's \\"For Once In My Life\\" and Glady Knight and the Pips' \\"I Heard It Through The Grapevine\\" there are parts that are just plain missing.  I'm very disappointed, as my favorite songs do not sound at all as I remember them.<br />Update:  I listened again.  I think I might have been mistaken when I said that parts were just plain missing.  I think it's just that the mono versions actually bury things that come across more clearly in the stereo versions.  It just a shame that the original record company couldn't have done a better job in light of the advent of the CD.
B000024D4R|5.0|Animals is one of the best albums from Pink Floyd who were arguably the greatest rock band after Led Zeppelin.I would put this as third best after Wish you were here and THE WALL.
B0007GAEW6|4.0|The Mars Volta is what happens when post-hardcore/punks make Pink Floyd (Ummagumma era) rock.   <br /> <br />Frances the Mute is one giant act, the record label forced Cedric and Omar in to chopping it up (so they would get paid for an album and not an EP).  All the TMV elements are here: latin percussion, spacey guitars, punk-fervor, and abstract lyrics... its a heady mix and unlike anything else out there.  The album is based on a journal that Jeremy Ward (Jim's cousin) found.  Jeremy died of a drug overdose and the album is dedicated to him.  Featuring some trumpet and guitar work courtesy of Flea and John Frusciante the sound is sprawling and, at times, confusing.  An excellent album to listen to on a long, dark late night drive. <br /> <br />TMV continue to bring the post-hardcore/punk ethic to music and the fact that Frances the Mute has reached such a wide audience, is very refreshing.  Although, without understanding the last thirty years of indie and punk rock in America... well let's just say that if Fugazi covered Rush it might sound like this. <br /> <br />Where Frances differs from DeLoused is mainly in length.  The style elements are similar, DeLoused is a tighter package, but a looser concept.  Where De-Loused and the Tremulant EP sound more like the band that released Relationship of Command, Frances is more immersive and more sprawling. <br /> <br />Oh and Cedric sings in Spanish a good bit.

0385486804|5.0|I am normally not much of a reader but on discovering that some of the account's in this book were about a friend of mine and former co-worker. I had to buy it just to see his name in it. But that was'nt enough I started to read it cover to cover. And the account's of Chris Mcandless and other's adventure's in the bush were very exciting and entertaining. I caught myself reading it daily after work. It is a great book and when I am done I plan to read more of John's book's. Maybe that is why I was never much of a reader I never found many that could catch my interest like John's writting's have.

0345451325|5.0|I had already played both Halo games and when I saw this book I decided to check it out.  I'm glad that I had.  This is a book that people who played the Halo games will enjoy.  It tells the formation of the Spartan II/Mjolinar program, including the origination of the characters Master Chief, Captain Keyes and Cortana. <br />There are a few reasons why I liked reading this book. (1), I loved reading about the Spartans - who they were, how they were created, and how their training went. (2) The space battles were the best I ever read.  You can just picture the ships battling in space above a planet. (3), The book was faced paced and kept my interest.  I kept reading it over and over again.  The thing I liked most was how Eric Nylund did great job of injecting some humanity into the Spartans, instead of making them seem like cold killing machines.  This is a must have for all Halo fans, and if you have never played the game you should pick it up and read it.  I guaranty that you will enjoy it.
0553296981|5.0|I bought this book for my 12 year old daughter to read for school.  At first she was not too thrilled at the prospect, as she considers this to be more of a \\"required reading\\" type of book than one she would pick herself, but she definitely saw the value in reading about this brave young woman's life.  I highly recommend this to other parents for their kids, especially those who are around the same age Anne was during this time.
B0006L16N8|1.0|Ok, so i don't own the album, but my dad does and it's crap! Talk is OK but everything else sucks! What's worse than being stuck in the car for 30 minutes with Chris Martin's flat nasally voice and boring tunes and crap lyrics blaring?? COLDPLAY. SUCK!!!!
B00006RIO7|4.0|The great thing about this film is that the musical numbers were done so brilliantly that you were drawn into each frame.  Your eyes were glued to the screen because everything was point on.  'Everything' included the singing as well and so this soundtrack, while losing some flare because there is no visual, still retains most of its flavor because Renee, Catherine, Queen Latifa and most notibly John C. Reily, all sing wonderfully.  While not carying the full power that say Ewan McGregor had in Moulin Rouge, John C. Reily still proves to be the highlight of the album.  This guy can really sing, heck, and who would have guessed it.  His rendition of 'Mister Cellophane' is one of my favorite tracks here.  Queen Latifa proves here that she is more than a rapper, but she has the pipes to blow, and she continued to prove that on her \\"The Dana Owens Album\\" release.  Her contributions on songs like 'When you're good to moma' and the track 'Class', which was cut from the film before release, are deffinate standouts.  Zeta-Jones and Zellweger, while stars of the film, do not hold as much talent in there pockets as Reilly and Latifa, but they still hold you attention better than Richard Gere who I felt was poorly casted.  Greg Kenear would have been a much better choice (man can that guy sing) or Kevin Spacey who has one of the best voices in hollywood (just watch 'Beyond the Sea')...Anyways, this soundtrack is a great compliment, and overall the songs are very well put together and showcase the talents of everyone involved (even when, in Gere's case, the talent is quite low).  So I give it a 4 1/2 mainly because, as great as the singing may be, without the visuals it loses pizzazz!  Oh yeah, and the last two tracks take away from the showbiz aspect of the film...they should have been left on the cutting room floor...
B0006399FS|3.0|My iPod made me buy the U2 album. <br />Wait, no. U2 made me buy my iPod. <br />Apple and Bono sitting in a tree... K.I.S.S.I.N.G... <br />_____________ <br />Seriously though, I'm not a big U2 fan (example: my favorite U2 album is POP) but this is a decent collection of songs once you eliminate track one and eleven. I can see how die hard U2 fans might find this one a bit weak. But they've been saying that about every album since Boy. Aicharumba!

0141301155|5.0|I read this book as a child growing up and now I am able to share this amazing story with my own kids.  This new edition has wonderful illustrations.  The story is timeless, regardless of what opinion you may have of either movie adaptation.
B0002IQHY8|4.0|Think Alan Parsons meets the Chemical Brothers.  Take Parson's hypersonics and merge them with electronica, dance sensibilities. Old time Parsons fans will need to listen an extra time or two to get it.  Very cool album. David Gilmour soars on \\"Trunguska\\", Parsons himself sings a fine lead vocal on \\"We Play the Game\\". <br />\\"Mannagamma\\" a riff on his earlier \\"Mammagamma\\" actually succeeds better than the original. <br />And \\"Chomolunga\\" with John Cleese, is well.. classic quirky Alan Parsons.  Extraordinary sound engineering as you might expect. I would put this in the upper half of Parson's albums overall. Not the best, but certainly far better than some of his early efforts.  Highly recommended for die hard Parsons fans, who are flexible enough to appreciate trance and electronica variations on the Parsons approach to music.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is the best album I have, and that's saying something! Every track is class, my favourite is Holiday. FANTASTIC WORK, GUYS!
B000002NFM|5.0|Wow!  Thats almost all I can say here.  Everyone has heard this CD by now because it's in such heavy rotation everywhere.  Clips from these songs are used in almost every action movie, some have even been on multiple soundtracks and featured in television shows, and you know why?  Because these songs are classic.  I remember the first time I saw the video for \\"BREATHE\\"...I was glued to the screen.  The song pumped through my veins for days...I just had to have more.  The song \\"SMACK MY .... UP\\" is one of the most in your face songs ever.  Just to set the record straight, the song is not in reference to abuse towards women as so many here have suggested.  One reviewer said how te Womans Rights Org. were all over the song and that he too did not agree with the subject matter.  The song is in reference to drug abuse...not female abuse, and as the video to expertly indicates, it's about the fact that all too often we abuse ourselves.  \\"FUNKY $HIT\\" is another one two punch, and \\"MINDFIELDS\\" just sets the right tone.  It's perfect 'vibe to' type music.  \\"FIRESTARTER\\" is a fan favorite, and justifiable so, with catchy lyrics and an explosive base track it's sure to start any fire.  \\"NARAYAN\\" is beautiful and \\"DIESEL POWER\\" does not dissapoint.  Prodigy was on point with this CD and attacks each song with the perfect mix of spontinaity and drive.  This is what these guys do, the deliver.  Perfect perchase.
B0007PAMR4|3.0|There are many flaws to the extended version on this DVD. <br /> <br />The latest I have discovered is that Brian Eno's beautiful music score has been removed from the film, and replaced by other less pleasant music. Eno is in the credits, but the music is gone. Eno's atmospheric music was very important to the mood in the film. <br /> <br />(You might also have noted that the Fremens eyes are not blue in the extended scenes).
0688156819|4.0|This is an interesting read mostly.  Take it out of your library and give it a spin.  It's doubtful you will want to purchase such a book unless you are a diehard Tim Burton nut.  The poetry can be elegant at times, and bizarre, not to mention all too brief. Cute book.  Makes you think.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|<br />Wow! This movie hooks you from the first minute on. It is the most wonderful tale of children on a train to see Santa Claus and they don't believe in him. Along the way, they find some very magical things happen to them. You have to watch this, regardless of your age.
0385513755|5.0|Secret societies, church scandals, and a heart pounding start to finish thriller.  Dan Browns, The DA Vinci Code, is a fast-paced thrill that will have your hand itching for the next page.  The story takes place in Paris, where main character, Robert Langdon, receives a phone call that will change his life forever.  The phone call indicates that Judicial Police in a murder case need Robert.  What they don't inform him is that he is the one being setup for the murder.  With an investigation he later learns he must work to clear his name but ends up in an ancient battle between the Catholic Church and a forgotten about brotherhood.
0783117523|5.0|Angelina Jolie's portrayal of super model Gia Marie Carangi is so spot on that it's almost scary.  The wild child of the 90's giving the performance of a lifetime as the wild child of the 70's/80's.  As Gia, Jolie takes you through the good times and the bad as she rises to the top of her game only to fall, hard and fast, struggling with her addictions, not only to heroin but also to her relationship with her female make-up artist.  Her death at the tender age of 26 (to AIDS) was a tragidy in so many ways, mostly because this young woman had so much to offer the world.  As the tagline says, she was too beautiful to die yet to wild to live.  This is a classic film, perfectly acted and scripted.  It's too bad it was never released in theaters for then it may have picked up more awards that it was due for.  Watch this, not only to see the tragic true life tale of icon Gia but also to see the beautiful and talented Angelina make her first of many marks on the world of motion picture!
B000E1155E|3.0|I thought I really liked this CD, but I checked Pitchfork's review and found out, much to my disappointment, that I was wrong! How was I misled? Well, apparently, according to Pitchfork, \\"The band's more starry-eyed backers compare their hardscrabble tales to those of predecessors such as the Specials, Smiths, Pulp, and the Streets,\\" yet (get this!) \\"The Monkeys aren't so much spinning deft tales of quotidian anxiety as just complaining about their first steps into nightlife, run-ins with bouncers, cops, and schoolmates(!)\\" I am so tired of freakin' starry-eyed backers! But, sure enough, here they are screwin' with my mind again. And Ptichfork's right: as I listened more and more to this CD, my stomach grew sicker and sicker as I slowly realized that these guys really aren't spinning deft tales of quotidian anxiety at all! They really are literally just complaining about their first steps into nightlife,run-ins with bouncers, cops, and schoolmates! Don't fall for these frauds!    I wish these guys were good, because then I could listen to the CD (which I love)! Oh, well.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|If you are a long term Johnny Cash fan the movie will not impress you as to script and direction.  If you are young and don't know much about Cash's career and personal life you will love this movie and DVD set. When I read Joaquin Phoenix was going to play Johnny I somehow knew he would do a great job...I guess from his looks, mannerisms, and method-acting training. When I read Reese Witherspoon was going to play June Carter Cash, I thought it was a joke. However, Witherspoon does a good job in her part and the chemistry with Joaquin worked very well.  <br /> <br />What really hurts this movie is the poor script, understanding this is a very difficult movie to make in the first place. However, much of the script doesn't work well and had it not been for great acting by Joaquin, and to a lesser extend Witherspoon, this movie would have been a box office bomb.   <br /> <br />Without question Joaquin Phoenix should win his Oscar nomination for \\"Performance by an actor in a leading role\\" at the 78th Annual Academy Awards, Sunday, March 5, 2006, but the odds are against him.  Walk The Line is a financial success only because it was a smaller budget, large release, movie at around $31 million production cost ($60 million after marketing and distribution), and pulled in $153 million in gross revenue, at the time of this post, due to some unexpected great acting. It's nice to see the studio get it right for a change. <br /> <br />HAVING DINNER WITH JOHNNY CASH - 25 years ago I got the rare opportunity to join two people and have dinner with Johnny Cash. One of these people was Johnny's personal friend, and I was a tag-along. The evening with Johnny lasted about 4 hours, including after dinner drinks. Me getting to go was nothing but luck and standing in the right place at the right time.  <br /> <br />At the time, I knew who Johnny Cash was but didn't know how large a legend he was or what an incredible person he was, until that evening. There was something about Johnny'sphysical size, voice, straight forward mannerism and his \\"against the grain\\" attitude that affected my life that night and even to this day. With Johnny there was no pretense with the man....he was who he was.  Thank God I was blessed with the opportunity to met the \\"Man in Black\\" in this personal setting.
0060934700|5.0|I just finished reading this one last night, and I will say this; it's been a long time since i've been so pleased while reading a collection of short stories. As a matter of fact, i will go so far as to say that i don't think i've ever read a collection that was as brilliant and heartfelt as this one was. Only Stephen King and Ray Bradbury match this one. Brillance, pure and simple. Masterful, Magic, Suspenseful, Sad, Happy, Classy,Powerful. All these things, this book was, and exceeded. Damn. This was a very good collection. That's all i can say about it, really. If i absolutely had to choose a short that was my favorite out of the whole thing, i'd say either \\"Chivalry\\" or \\"Wedding Gift\\". Although i did love each and every one of these shorts. The sonnets and poetry didn't really grab me, although \\"Nicholas Was..\\" was damned brillaint. First Rowling, now Gaiman. It must the the Invasion of The Brit  authors, for me at least, even though both of these authors have been around for a long, long time. Before  another month is up, i will say this...don't let it surprise you if i have reviewed every single one of Gaiman's novels and collections on this site. They are damned near Majickal. Now, i think i shall start of Anansi Boys. A piece of it was at the back of this book, and i went out abd bought a copy as soon as i was done reading that piece. Brillaint. <br /> <br />Hawksmoor...From The Bleed.
B000BYA4JM|5.0|Why has it taken so long for Who's That Girl to make it to DVD?? My roommate has this movie on Laser Disc.  The quality of the laser disc doesn't give this movie justice, nor VHS.  I prefer it as widescreen DVD. Eitherway, for the year this movie came out, it's one of the best entertaining films.  If you want a fun movie to watch, then get this one.   <br />Madonna does best when she's having fun. All her films are great except for a few, but who cares.  When she's doing comedy, she's hilarious. Her role on Will and Grace proves how great she is when she's doing comedy.  Why can't she do more like these? I love her work regardless and Who's that Girl soundtrack is just as great and fun as the movie.   <br />I totally recommend this movie to everyone.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|Austen's novel is based on sharp observations on human nature.  In particular, Elisabeth's attraction to the opposite sex is not so much her beauty but the beauty of thought and the ability to engage others with witty verbal exchanges. The fast and intense fireworks between Elisabeth and Darcy have been partially destroyed by the film's script, which assume movie viewers cannot understand or follow their long verbal duels.  It is sad how the new script have cut or shortened these exchanges.  The music and the scenary tries to compensate for its loss but the result is never fully satisfying!
B00009V7P8|5.0|This is a great piece, and I call it that because it all seems to flow together to chronicle a story, the details of which are left up to the reader. Its highlights include beautiful vocals that are utterly raw and unafraid juxtaposed with instrumentals that could make you melt. It all ends up blending together to form one body, one voice, and one soul. You will (guaranteed) get chills at least once per song. Buy this CD! If you like it, you should also see him live. He is amazing.

B00005QK3W|5.0|Anybody who has followed Paul Mccartney's career closely know's that when the man is struck with adversity he sacks up and pulls a gem out of his arse.  Not to say that he hasn't always provided us with great music but his most spectacular achievements as a solo artist have come when he is under the gun...i.e Band on the Run, Tug of War, and now Driving Rain.  This album never gets boring because of the spectrum of music genres it covers.  Paul has always been known for his broad range of musical taiste but never has he displayed it so well on one album.  Ranging from straight driving hard rock (Lonely Road, Driving Rain, About You, Rinse the Raindrops) to India Music (Riding to Jaipur) to mid tempo rockers (Magic, Tiny Bubble, Heather, She's givin' up Talking, Spinning on an Axis) to his trademark ballads in acoustic (I Do, and Your Way) and with the Piano (Lover to a Friend, and Your Loving Flame) The thing I really love about this album is that everytime I play it I find I have a new favorite song. I mean it covers such a spectrum of emotion that it takes you on a roller coaster ride from melancholy to joy to everything in between.  Never before has Sir Paul communicated in lyrics so eloquently what is actually going on inside of this brilliant songwriters head.  Not to mention the tremendous Bass lines he provides-Something he never has gotten enough credit for.  For so long fans and critics alike have beaten Paul up over some of the rediculously simple songs he has put out that it was obviously clear he needs proper motivation to show us what he really is still capeable of.  And that is one fantastic front to back jam packed CD of quality music.

B000BYA5G4|1.0|Well what can I say about this movie, that does not include curse words. First off Jared Leto, horrable, he was in requime for a dream so you figure he knows how to act like hes high. But he just spits cliched lines and falls into chrismas trees. <br /> <br />Cage was even worse because no one kills him, which leads to an even longer set of monologs. If you can put up with Cage trying to be Ben Stien for what feels like a lifetime I suggest you by thi movie. <br /> <br />P.S. near the end cage blabs more facts about gunsales that you ever thought existed.
B000E1ZBH2|5.0|I completely adored this movie adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel.  I must admit, I was weary when first seeing the previews because I am such a huge fan of both the book and the Colin Firth movie version.  But this movie was a complete joy from start to finish.  It was both funny and it moved a little quicker than the Colin Firth version (that one's about 4 hours longer!), though I thought it covered all the important plot points.  Two thumbs way up from me!
0312954468|2.0|This might be a good book, but the homosexual-pedophile rape of slave-boys by Lord Intef (pp.39-40) just turned my stomach.  I'm surprised nobody has commented on this.   <br /> <br />I've read far worse material, for example \\"The Rape of Nanking,\\" which has the dis-privilege of being documented history.  But I'ld rather save the gruesome details for a history/ethics lesson than my leisurely weekend read. <br /> <br />
B000BTJDGC|5.0|The Exorcism of Emily Rose is one of those films that combines moments of real horror and suspense so perfectly that, in the end, it doesn't even feel like a movie. Nothing is overdone, the acting isn't over-the-top, the CGI is very low-key, and while the typical horror scares are there (loud noises), they rely upon moods much more.<br /><br />In essence, this is kind of a courtroom drama. The duration of the movie is taking place as Father Moore is on trial, and Emily's story is told throughout the trial through flash-backs, a tape, and a letter. That's not at all what I was expecting, in fact I didn't even know there was a trial included, but it is effective in it's usage. What bothers me is that we never really know what Emily was like before the possession, that makes it a little more difficult to empathize with her situation, though how hard is it to feel sorry for a girl that has demons possessing her?<br /><br />I like the fact that there's not a lot of special effects in this film, that makes it feel more real to me. Plus, without the use of extreme makeup I feel it gives more credibilty than The Exorcist did. Not to mention the actual exorcism in this movie. The exorcism scene is so effective and gripping that it's hard to forget, the dual vocals, the screaming, I'm hardpressed to think of a more powerful scene in a movie that came out in 2005.<br /><br />The casting was, for me, perfect. Laura Linney and Campbell Scott as the two attorneys was completely believable, as was Tom Wilkinson as Father Moore. Jennifer Carpenter as Emily Rose was incredible, she really made you feel her suffering throughout the movie.<br /><br />For me, I think this was 2005's best movie. It's a shame it took me this long to actually see it, but it was worth the wait. No review I read did this film justice, and I doubt any review really will. If you're looking for a horror/suspense movie, look no further than The Exorcism of Emily Rose.
0385484518|5.0|I gave this book as a surprise gift to my mother who is 81 years old. She had heard an excellent review on TV and was interested in obtaining a copy. On arrival, she eagerly read the whole book in two evenings, staying up until 2am to finish it. Her first comment to me the next day was that she looked forward to reading it again soon. In turn, she read several passages to me from the book that she admired and I, too, look forward to borrowing it from her soon.
0393317552|5.0|A clearly written, well supported thesis addressing a question that I, and many others, have pondered.

A must for anyone interested in human society, human history, or biology.
B0000CEB4V|4.0|Much has been written about practically ever aspect of this double DVD. If I choose to write about it is purely out of joining the awe and gratitude I have for George's songs and spiritual path.<br /><br />The music here lives up to its author, if nothing else you will be reminded of one of the most impressive songbooks in popular music ever. Every single song, harking back to early Beatles remains fresh and, overall, shows Harrison's continuous maturing as a songwriter.<br /><br />Of the two DVDs, I'm definitely partial to the second one, mainly song rehearsals and brief and intelligent interviews paced and blended seamlessly, at times transporting one song to the actual live footage from the concert.<br /><br />Standouts for me: \\"Isn't It A Pity\\" is probably \\"the moment\\" in opinion. Billy Preston sings the song of his life and Clapton's vocals and solo are his best stuff in years. Of course \\"Something\\" -from Paul's soft touch and his ukulele to the full blown Rock finale- is worth seeing, and Tom Petty's covers and his playing along Jeff Lyne reprising the Willburys' \\"Handle With Care,\\" are great.<br /><br />Just as poignant are Ringo's \\"Photograph\\" singing his heart out and bringing pure, new energy to the stage, and Joe Brown's gorgeous and humble \\"Here Comes the Sun.\\"<br /><br />Normally, I'm not that adept to watching concert DVDs. This is one exception, skeptic as I was of the potential sentimentality and greed of Tribute concerts I was stunned with the beauty of offering.
B0002S94OS|2.0|Coming in with great expectations this CD leaves as an almost astounding flop. I cannot help but feel hugely dissapointed after listening to this album. This is suppose to be the leader of the pack of new American heavy metal? This? Please. This CD and band is mearly average at best. I am perplexed at the amount of fanfare this band recieves. The only good thing about this band that I can comprehend is that the drummer really knows what he's doing. But who wants to sit around and listen to a good drummer playing in a mediorce band? Not I. Most of the songs sound the same and it is really hard to tell which song is which because they have no hooks to make me want to remember them. They are quickly forgotten afterwards and that is that. The vocalist drives me nuts! His voice is just down right irratating, but I have it somewhere before. But where? It kept me awake for hours before it hit. I know where I have heard him before, a Speak & Spell. That's right he sounds like a friggen Speak & Spell. You know what I'm talking about, anyone who has seen Daine Cook's standup knows what I'm talking about. The guitars are passable, nothing great but not bad either except I have heard them too some where before...oh that's right, hey dudes, Kerry King called and he wants his riffs back. The bass spends a lot of time chugging away and doesn't really bring anything to the sonic pallette but doesn't subtract either. Overall the music just isn't that great or catchy and is forgettable. If you guys are looking for a metal fix go out and get an ablum from Necrophagist, Cryptopsy, Atheist, or any old Sepultura or 80's Metallica.<br /><br />Pros: Good drummer. Guitars are alright.<br /><br />Cons: Vocalist sounds like a Speak and Spell and is really annoaying. Not very many solos. Slayer called and they want their riffs back. Songs are forgetable and all sound the same.<br /><br />Bottom Line: A very overrated release from a mediorce band that for some reason seems to be very popular. This would probably be a three without that annoying vocalist.three without that annoying vocalist.
0892818875|4.0|This book was well-written, and gives a nice overview of the Chinese view of the elements and yin and yang. It uses this information as a basis of how to achieve balance and determine which oils will have the best effect. The book covers a wide range of commonly available essential oils in good detail, including the elements that rule them and both physical and psychological applications. The book's biggest shortcoming was it's index. I feel that it should have been more in-depth and have included more of the physical conditions that are listed in each oil's description so that it would be easier to find which oils treat which disorders.
0736063684|4.0|The book contains great pictures for various training methods and shows exactly which muscles are used in each method... <br />However...I was very disappointed to see when I opened the book, that it was upside down inside...probably a mistake that only happened to a few books, still it irritates me to pay full prise for something that isn't the way it's supposed to be...
B00004XONN|5.0|Inspector: Radiohead were not dumped by Captiol/EMI, the band decided not to re-sign for now(they will be back). Deux-Deux: Kid A was not a FLOP Inspector, it hit #1 in the US and went Platinum with a million copies sold(takes a million copies to sell before it hits Platinum in America unlike England which is a smaller place). Inspector: Songs like Optimistic, The National Anthem and Morning Bell have more musical merit than any song by those fugitives Scissor Sisters. Deux-Deux: Holy frinholy, aye caramba, anyone who passes over this for Scissor Sisters deserves jail time.
B000002GXS|5.0|My friend just recently got me a ton of Tom Waits albums... and out of all of them, this is my favorite, by far!  Every single song on this CD is classic... I have a copy on my car for long, warm nights or weekends on the town, and I'll be making a copy to keep in my wreck room, in the cd player, near the pool table.  Awesome stuff. GET IT.
1597371416|3.0|This is my favorite Jane Austen novel and I have read it many times.  The main flaw in this reading is that it was too hurried.  There was barely a pause between chapters and the quick speech did not do justice to all of the characters.  I found the reader's voice to be as little high pitched and a little mannered, even for Austen.  Flaws aside, I still got enjoyment from this reading.  The speed became less distracting as I became used to it and there were some fine readings of exchanges between Elizabeth and Darcy. Bottom line: not up to the standard that Pride and Prejudice deserves.
B0002S94OS|5.0|Oh man, this album kicks some major ass. If I'm not wearing headphones, there is no way I can't headbang while this album is blasting. And I've tried with headphones, they just come flying off and I can't hear the song anymore, which sucks, which is why I don't do it. In other words, this album makes you want to buy a strap for your headphones, or if you don't care about waking the neighbors, makes you buy a full Marshall stack, hook your CD player to it, turn all knobs to Max, and play the loudest metal you've ever heard outside of a concert. Like I mentioned above, if my job was to just walk around being a badass, this album would be my soundtrack. Some death metal comes across as ridiculous, with the unusual vocals and all, but people know not to mess with Lamb of God. I mean they're called LAMB OF GOD. Probably the best band name ever. And they make a sweet ass album too.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Inspector: Scarface was one of the greatest movies ever made. Deux-Deux: Si Inspector, I think Al Pacino gave his best performance since Dog Day Afternoon in this movie. Inspector: Tony Montana is one bad dude and I would try to arrest him but I choose not to. Deux-Deux: People still quote from this movie today and has aged well. Inspector: The last reviewer needs to GROW UP and leave Amazon and I am placing him under arrest for panning people who like this movie. Deux-Deux: Cranky and his aliases are wanted for being immature and gets hissy when people don't like his reviews. Inspector: Sentence for trashing Scarface, LIFE IMPRISONMENT!
B0007Y08PQ|5.0|I've been a Star Trek fan for a long time, and for the most part I agree with most people on the Trek movies.  For instance, I think Nemesis, is horrible.  But then I hear people saying this is a horrible movie.  I have to disagree, this movie is great. <br /> <br />One of the things that I love about Star Trek, is how the episodes are all about contempory and controversial issues, that is what this movie is all about, issues.  Society at large in this movie have decided that they can take advantage of a civilization because it benefits them more than it benefits this group of people.  This movie is much more complex than many of the older movies (and definitely more complex than the one movie that's newer).   <br /> <br />What makes any movie great?  Issues that are covered in the movie that challenge society, I feel that this is something that's in any movie that is successful over the years, and this movie does that.
0064400557|5.0|Somehow I was asked, or was volunteered by my wife, to read to my second grade daughter's class. I thought it would be fun so I said sure. <br /> <br />Her teacher picked this book for me to read, which I hadn't read before but I had seen the movie. I have to say, I was great fun! It's an easy book to read and the kids really enjoyed the voices that I did, especially Templeton's (who ended up being the voice I'd used for Snape while reading Harry Potter to my daughters). <br /> <br />The animated movie that was made a few years back followed very closely this book.  Which was good and bad -- bad because many of the children had seen the movie and so anticipated things that were coming, but I think also good because it might be nice for the children to see it portrayed so closely after reading or listening to the book themselves. <br /> <br />Now I'm going to look into more E.B White books to see if the others are as good.
