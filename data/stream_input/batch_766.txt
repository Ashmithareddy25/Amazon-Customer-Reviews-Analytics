0670034711|4.0|I was suprised to see so many negative reviews.  Comments about how self-centered Elizabeth Gilbert is and so on. Let's be real- it's a MEMOIR. Of course it's all about her, told from HER point of view, about HER needs and desires.  I truly enjoyed the book, but looked at it as a something that I should take my own perspective from.  What do I want, what are my spiritual and pleasure goals?  I feel like if you read and take it as being about someone who was able to really examine her own needs and look at how you can do the same you will enjoy it.
B000TDDHQ2|4.0|I got interested in ambient music through first listening to 'nature sounds' CDs, like thunderstorms or falling rain. The minimalist sound lets you fill that space with your own thoughts. Plus it really chills you out. Then I found Brian Eno and downloaded \\"Discreet Music\\", wanted more, and found \\"On Land\\".    \\"The Lost Day\\" is expansive and let's your mind make up stories for the music. It sounds like dark restlessness. \\"Dunwich Beach Autumn 1960\\" is my favorite track- it reminds me of home, not as it was, but how it might have been. \\"Shadow\\" is vaguely disturbing. All in all this is a very interesting collection of soundscapes.

B0013FYTA8|5.0|I absolutely love Theory of a Deadmans new cd.I have all 3 of their albums and highly recommend them all.I have only had this cd for 28 hours but listened to it dozens of times and I like all the songs so much I cant even pick a favorite.I have several favorites!Its a perfect mix of slower songs and upbeat songs that just make a great cd for whatever mood your in.Theres something on this cd for everyone and I think alot of people will be able to relate to it.    If you want to make your significant other a mixed cd,theres definitely some songs on here for it! Want to dance like no ones looking? There are some songs on here that are so hot they will make you want to play them over and over all day long! I highly recommend this cd.
B00005K3OT|5.0|I loved it.  Not too mention you want to break out the chocolate while you are watching it!
0316001821|4.0|\\"The Lovely Bones\\" is one of those books readers will find hard to put down once they begin reading it.  The story is told from the perspective of a 14-year-old girl, named Susie, who is brutally murdered by her neighbor.  After her death Susie must come to terms with what happened and is stuck \\"between heaven and earth\\" until she can accept her death.  Susie watches her family, friends, and neighbors as they try to deal with this terrible crime.  She also watches her murderer as he tries to cover-up the murder.<br /><br />Alongside Susie, the reader witnesses the overwhelming grief that almost kills her father, her sister's resolve to go on with life, her mother's efforts to face some truths she has tried to bury, and her murderer's past and secret life.  This story is mesmerizing.  The frailty and randomness of life are clearly felt.  I enjoyed reading this book because the author does not provide easy answers, which makes the story line believable.
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|Celine is at her best in this show.  What is amazing is that you get to see her show with all its polish and shine and then have the opportunity to watch the whole show from behind the scenes.  I have never seen both sides done in this manner and it was great.  You get your monies worth with this DVD.
0385334206|5.0|I'm confused as to how people gave this 1 star.  This was one of my favorite Vonnegut books.  It isn't laugh out loud funny, or an unselfish attempt to please with a predictable plot, but it's not supposed to be.   I found it conceptually exciting, and the end got me a little teary eyed because I empathize with what was illustrated (non-literally, although this book is full of cute illustrations).     And with that in mind;     If you like Vonnegut and you're not full of preformed thought about what a book *has* to be like, I recommend this book highly.     If you're new to Vonnegut, and don't understand his wicked little world/style, this probably isn't the best starting point.   Try Cat's Cradle.
B0015KO52S|4.0|Relly enjoying this album as I did their last, but...anybody else experiencing Windows Media Player erroneously displaying it as Soul Donkey by The Sugarmen Three?  I got a replacement cd from Amazon and same thing.  Way to go Third Man!!
0743298039|1.0|Ok, I read to page 127 and then skipped around as I could not yet find anything that made me want to keep reading.  Maybe my problem is that I never liked the book, \\"Wuthering Heights\\" (yes I suffered and read the whole thing), so that is probably why I didn't like this one.  Not my cup of tea?    Yes, it was descriptive and the characters were different. But I just didn't find anything in the characters to identify with so they seemed \\"flat\\", not real, to me. So, then I didn't like the characters, so I didn't care about them.  Plenty of description of the settings, but I felt it too wordy, not really pulling me in.      Less is more?  I think if it was maybe 180 pages as opposed to 400, it would have had more substance for me, a little more intense. But I just couldn't get into it. My neighbor was reading the book and felt the same way as I.     So if you are thinking of buying the book, perhaps go to the library and read a few pages and see if it grips you or not.
B00139B39E|5.0|Some might think a hits collection is a waste of money and time, however, for a huge fan such as myself it is well worth the money. It is fun to hear songs like \\"Pull Me Under\\" remixed to sound so clean and new. Plus the one unreleased track, \\"To Live Forever\\" makes it worth the money just by itself. Plus, it is genius to market this collection towards those who have never listened to the band, being that it has a little of everything for everyone.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|The Ark of Truth finishes the conflict with the ORI, which was left unresolved when the show came to an unceremonious close. We (True Stargate SG-1 fans) were left Hanging when the show ended without a resolution to the Ori storyline. I enjoyed the movie, however I still felt that the resolution was rushed. There seemed like there was enough complications to handle to fill 2 DVD's. This has been my favorite Science Fiction show (take that Battlstar Galactica)! However, I must admit that the show lost it's way when RDA retired. I kept hoping that he would show up in the movie, for a last bow. Ben Browder & Claudia Black gave it a valient try, but the Chemistry between Cantanerous Jack O'Neil-Samantha Carter- Daniel Jackson & Teal'c could not be matched. This is the Only TV show that I am familier with that was better than the Original feature length film (which , I did enjoy). Enjoy the DVD. And Richard Dean Anderson get busted back to Colonel for hitting some politician in the mouth, and come back and re-unite the Fab. Four for a Big Screen Feature Length Movie. If Bill Shatner did it, you certainly can!
B000LE1GVW|4.0|The one thing that I really like about this CD is the lyrics; They are unconventional and winding; They touch on subjects you didn't expect to hear, and often evoke emotions from inside you didn't think a song could bring out. Coupled with the passion in his voice and some truly great melodies, this guy is someone to watch. Reminds me a little of Cat Stevens at times, but he is a true original for sure. A unique voice w/something to say.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|This artistic depiction of the struggles of life in a time period filled with controversy is simply brilliant.  It makes one wonder whether The Beatles had a story similar to this when they sat down to lay down their own legendary lyrics and rhythms.
0618680004|5.0|Eloquently written, I'd almost say that Dr. Dawkin's grasp of the English language is devine ;)<br />Being raised without religion I had always considered religion to be a benign thing of the past or the feeble minded.  World events and personal matters have brought religion more to the forefront and in my search for answers I stumbled upon Richard Dawkin's website and book.<br />This book gave some insight into some of the more dangerous aspects of religion (consequently I have also read and thouroughly dismissed the counter arguments)<br />On the whole it made me a lot more confident of my atheist position and my views on living a good life.
B000Q6GUW0|1.0|Despite being one of the most original concepts in years, I find this series extremely disturbing.  Yes the characters are interesting and the plot intriguing, but what message are we sending by hailing a serial killer as a hero?<br /><br />Dexter is a CSI tech that is also a serial killer.  Because he only kills \\"bad\\" people, this series paints him as a rescuer of those not getting justice through the proper channels.  Dexter takes \\"Batman\\" to a horrifying level.  Someone who is a psychopath is showing America that the ends justifies the means.  Dexter sees himself as an unsung hero \\"taking out the trash,\\" which may send young immature teen minds in the same direction.<br /><br />Without saying too much and ruining the ending: Dexter does overcome his dark side to be the hero, only to do the \\"courageous\\" thing and take another life that needs to be ended. Showing with vividness the great deed he is doing to make this world a better place.<br /><br />I feel that this show should have been left on Showtime where it was at least a little harder for teens to get to. The maturity needed to digest the message in this show is usually not found in teens and most parents don't monitor what their kids watch as long as it is on regular tv. Meanwhile Dexter makes the taking of life, valiant, courageous and necessary. Young people (not kids, but teens) may not be able to get the underlying meaning, but they can't miss the vigilante hero that is Dexter.<br /><br />I cannot support this show, no matter how original, how intriguing, or how well written.  I will stick to [[ASIN:1932382437 CSI: Crime Scene Investigation--Dominos, Vol. 4 (CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (IDW))]]. Where the good guys wear a badge.
B000ANVQ0K|1.0|Probably nobody, with all the resources and the huge budget he had at hand could have made a worse \\"romantic\\" movie than Mr Cameron. It feels like Arnold is about to jump in any time (at least if he had the movie would perhaps have been funny). Actually in the scene in which Kate W. with her iron bar runs through the sinking ship smashing here and there while looking for Leo, you expect her to utter \\"Hasta la vista baby\\" from one moment to the other.    The whole love story lacks credibility, characters are schematically terribly bad or awfully nice and the movie sinks down well before the ship does.     Only worth watching if you want to appreciate the catalogue of amazing special effects without caring at all about the plot and amazing (may be even terrifying) when thinking about how powerfully marketing can influence audiences (including myself... I went to see it)    In all other respects, very likely the worst movie I have ever seen.
B00005JPTK|4.0|I liked it; it may be my favorite version--though I still love the Vincent Price one.  Will Smith did a great job carrying the movie by himself (of course with lots of help from Sam!).  It was funny, sad, scary and made me think--not all movies can say that.  I wished they had expanded the preface of the beginning a little further, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I don't want to give anything away, so I'll stop here. Give it a try, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
B00139B39E|5.0|Here's comes Dream Theater with their first greatest hit collection.  At least it's not another live set.  I guess in between studio albums, this just makes sense.  While this is geared to the first time listener to capture the sound of this remarkable group, it still has a few elements for the die-hard fan.  The remix's are certainly the key here if you want to see how they are polished up. The one unreleased track 'To Live Forever' would be the reason to buy this if you don't already have a studio mix of it.  While the remix's are great, one has to wonder why they chose those songs and maybe not several more from their next couple of albums.  I think 'To Live Forever' is included because it is LaBrie's welcome into the band.  The song that should have made it onto this collection is 'The Way It Used to Be'.  But it's not here and one has to wonder why.  Plus I don't understand the logic behind the edits of songs like 'Solitary Shell'.  Taking it to the edit form just kills the song overall.  But I would surmise it's for the first time listener and nothing more.  Fans of this group won't purchase this for edited versions of songs that they already own.  I would have loved to see more b-side or unreleased tracks on this collection because I'm sure the band has plenty that have never made it to the final cut.  But I still have to give this 5 stars because they're all great songs.  So, for those of you who want to get your feet wet with Dream Theater, then this collection is a great way to start.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|Finally a music talent today who isn't afraid to be herself.  Her voice is as peaceful as Eva Cassidy's and her lyrics are absolutely brilliant. Reminds me of Michelle Branch's 'Hotel Paper' - my favorite album of all time, Little Voice could easily tie, if not become a close second.
0143038419|5.0|I received this book very quickly!!  It was in perfect condition...Thx for the quick service!!
B000ZN802W|4.0|I've read several reviews here, both unfavorable and favorable, but it seems like a lot of reviewers don't like the movie because they see McCandless as foolish.  Likewise, some have gone so far as to say that he was heroic or courageous.  I personally didn't know the young man, and neither did you.    What I do know is that he was a YOUNG man. I know that there was a lot of things I disliked or even loathed about this world we live in when I was 23.  I think a lot of us at some time in our lives have wanted to get away from it all, but he tried and that's what makes it a great story.  The fact that he refers to himself as \\"Alexander Supertramp\\" says a lot about what he's doing.  He's trying to start a whole new life, complete with the new identity.  To me, this screams out that this is a troubled soul, but I believe a soul that was capable of being healed.  He was without a doubt, ill prepared for this journey.  He was irresponsible in many ways.  He was selfish in some ways mainly in the way he alienated those who cared about him, but I feel that had he survived he would have come around and had one great story to tell.  The reason I believe this is because of the note found on the bus when his body was found.  I can't remember it word for word, but I do know that he signed it Christopher McCandless.  He knew he was going to die and in his mind there wasn't anything he could do to prevent it.  If you knew you were going to die soon, this might cause you to reflect on some things.  Well, to me, it seems that upon the contemplation of his own imminent death he realized who he was and dropped this juvenile alter ego and that seems to be a step up in maturity.  Sadly, it was too late.  If you dislike the book or movie because he seemed foolish, then you just disliked what he did. Use this movie as a tool to show your kids what not to do when they go through that phase. The movie does a great job staying true to the book.  I thought it was well acted.  Hal Holbrook wasgreat and it was nice to see Vince Vaughn play something with a little, just a little more substance than his usual role.  Just remember, if he had lived, you wouldn't be reading this.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|A wonderful take on the Lewis Carroll tome, with the usual fun Disney touches, and family-friendly. A great time for everyone.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|great movie. not for the whole family but older teens are ok, and if they are too young they wont get it anyway. The music is wonderful. Great director and producer. Very creative interpretations of the beatles songs. Fun to watch. Brings back memories of the sixties and seventies. Makes people talk. Makes you look at the events of today differently.
0307388840|3.0|I thought the story was good, but it could have been accomplished in about half the pages.  When I read a book, I read and read and read until it is finished.  I read the last Harry Potter book in three days, and it only took that long because I had to take care of my three kids.  It took me nearly three MONTHS to finish this book.  The first half, the majority of which was written through the perspective of Briony, was excruciating.  I understand that it was supposed to be the dreamy, imaginative thoughts of her character, but really....it was simply painful to read and pointless.  The rest of the character perspectives were so much better.  And as far as the ending, I'm still not entirely sure what really happened?!?!?
0893860220|5.0|I Am That. How beautifull to know i am nobody, and yet, everything.  Searching since i was 15 my library became immense at one point in time.  Now at 33 my library is narrowed down to this book, Tolle's books and maharshi.  What a relief this book was, so perfectly dialogued.  Two pages read upon starting my day ceases thought, if there was any to begin with, and just saying, 'i am' a few times pulls me into reality.  A simple Yes to life, and, I Am.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|Hmmmm...a musical about a homicidal barber?  And he has an accomplice who owns a tavern and helps dispose of his victims by.....mincing them into meat pasties?    Imagine those many years ago when Stephen Sondheim's principle backers heard a summation of \\"Sweeney Todd:  The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.\\"  Not an easy sell even before PC started being a concern for the entertainment industry.  And while it would go on to become one of the most heralded musicals of stage history, well, you just can't picture ANYONE taking a bigger risk, financially and artistically, to bring it to the screen.    Enter Tim Burton.  It's hard to picture now, with all the delightfully quirky films under his belt, but he did do some (fairly) mainstream films.  It was only after he got box office cred that studios took risks on his more outlandish and, dare I say it, darker offerings.  While he had some box office failures in this mode (\\"Planet of the Apes\\"), it turns out people had a liking for his artistic delivery of story.  Burton is, at the very least, certainly creative visually.  My view of the selling of \\"Sweeney Todd\\" in today's film development Hell was clinched when the studios were told, \\"oh, yeah, and we have a solid commitment from Tim Burton.\\"  They could have tossed in Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham-Carter and all the other talent they had lined up to make the movie (a veritable litany of success), and probably gotten a \\"no thanks.\\"  But add Burton to the mix of this beauty of a film and....ah, he was, to use the cliche', tailor-made for bringing it to the screen.    Sondheim purists have heard, correctly, that a lot of the score, songlist, and book was dropped.  Some of it was significantly changed.  It has been, but with Mr. Sondheim highly endorsing it, you have to imagine it's as good for film as the original was done for the stage.  It's sung very well, with the actors sometimes reaching very high heights for actors who aren't singers.  Depp is surprisingly gifted in musical delivery and while Bonham-Carter will never compete with Celene Dion in volume and power (thank you God for that!), she is very capable and pleasant to listen to.  What they bring to the table is their acting chops.  One expects over-the-top with a story that is a mixture of melodrama, grotesquerie, and even broad comedy.  The cast of \\"Todd\\" surpasses musical theater gimmickry by using their skills to bring about the subtle touches to their fantastic roles.  Depp's Todd is insane, vicious, and barbaric in persuit of revenge, and yet you can see the haunting pain that drives him, giving Sweeney a touch of sadness, a window into what the man might have been if his life developed differently.  Bonham-Carter is hysterical and wicked as Mrs. Lovett, someone who was thoroughly incapable of cooking decent food until Todd gave her some most unusual motivation.  With her as well, we get the hystrionics we expect, but we see the gentler side of her as well.  Is it the madness of Sweeney that drives her, or perhaps, if they had a more normal courtship, is it genuine love that makes her grow?  Alas, Bonham-Carter, like Depp, lets us only see just enough to add a soupscon of humanity to an otherwise batty character.    Burton also delivers on his trademark visual imagery.  We have a weird, sepia-toned world where nothing is completely color or black-and-white.  The only hints of color are in idyllic fantasy or memory (example - Sweeney's flashback of life before framing).  Also, there's no brightness or comfort.  Burton's London is a dire, shadowy, wonderfully creepy Dickensonian city of hidden fear and rats.  The only thing in bright color in this corner of Hell is the blood.  And there is blood.  Lots of blood.  Buckets of blood.  In disgustingly viscous gouts, gushes, drips, and slithery splatters (all this just in the opening credits alone, never mind the scores of murders!).  Also in color is the meat made of the victims.  And the flames of the pie oven.  Thus the queasyneed be warned - what you've heard is true.  We who've seen it aren't exaggerating.  You will be nauseated by the halfway point and vomiting at the end.  If you can put aside the ghastlyness of all this, you can enjoy the stylistic fun of it all.  Think of it as a slasher film on speed with more of a budget.    \\"Sweeney Todd\\" delivers big.  It may not be to everybody's taste (sorry), but those who can endure will find something truly special.
140130916X|5.0|I walked by this book and said eh, what the heck let me read this book before I see the movie. I am so glad I bought it. I still have not seen the movie but this book had me laughing out loud as well as in tears on the Train into work even. I would recommend this book to all. I fell in love with Cecelia Ahern's writing, I can't book her books down
B000GOWM2O|4.0|I saw the movie and it was good. This movie whole story was good and it's sad and laugh. Also some scenes are beautiful. This movie feels love and lonely. The soundtrack was nice. This movie was good for whole family.
B0011FDVKE|5.0|I came in relatively early, right after [[ASIN:B000066HQB Bramble Rose]] was released. She immediately went on my radar as an artist to be reckoned with. Seems the critics agreed, but the mainstream ignored her. Some play on GAC and CMT, but she never caught on. I really enjoyed the album, but at the time I was thinking, \\"Wait for the voice to mature, and show more range in style.\\" Then, here comes [[ASIN:B0002OPES2 Tambourine]] and I'm thinking, \\"Yah, I sure called that one.\\" Again, the critics agreed; even the Grammys noticed. Even less play on the video channels and no one else noticed. Had tickets for her in Columbia, MO. But, that got cancelled when she got billed with Elvis Costello. Looked like [[ASIN:B0002OPES2 Tambourine]] might have legs. I understood she had to do what she needed to do. Sorely disappointed though. I knew it would likely be my one chance to see her. We don't get much entertainment out here in Wheretheheckamiandwhyamihere, Iowa.     Then, nothing.    I'm no insider, and I sure don't know much about spiritual journeys to France. I just happened to be in the Target out here in Whatdididosowrongastowinduphere, Iowa and wandered over to the CD, DVD racks. Couldn't believe my eyes. A new Tift Merritt album. That's all I needed to know.    I was well rewarded for my trust in her. Her voice is rich and rings like a bell; the lyrics outstanding. In general, the sound harks back to earlier days yet, track after track stands solidly on its own. I meant to jump on Amazon and write the review right then. I don't write all that many reviews. Would have been near the first review, too. Just as well. Had a chance to play it a couple more times, which has led me to beleive that this is probably the best album of the year. And it's only March. I listen to a wide range of music, nearly constantly. Don't much like such grandstanding in the millions of Amazon reviews out there. But, I think I'm on solid ground here. Tift Merrit has the best album of 2008. Already. So, maybe this time she'll get noticed? Well, she already has been here in Getmeouttahere, Iowa.
B000001Y42|1.0|the only thing i have to say is this debut from LB was corney it was trash this album was so whack i wanted to go to the studio and kill them thank go i did'nt. But really the way fred was singing it was retarted especially the song pollution this album was'nt worth it don't buy it you will be real pissed of if you do.
B000002ACR|5.0|For the longest time, I never bothered with the Byrds. I'm not a hippie, but grew up during the punk/new wave era, and brought a lot of my esthetics from that sound, along with the Doors, Velvet Underground, and Rolling Stones.  I liked Bob Dylan as well, but as for the Byrds, I thought only of their earliest work, when they did Dylan covers with thick harmonies. Much later, maybe after hearing how REM, or PETTY, were so influence by the Byrds, that I got a BEST OF cassette, but it still didnt show thet whole story. Well, I got this album, and NOTORIOUS BYRD BROTHERS, and found out the truth. This was the trippiest band around, for awhile. They did psychedelia very early on, (5th Dimention) in fact, they turned on John Lennon to his second acid trip. For early 1967, its amazing to hear how freaky so many of these songs are. ROCK AND ROLL STAR is all anphememine rush. Done live in concert (Monterey Pop Festival Box set ONLY, sadly) these songs were performed at super high velocities. Crosby's songs stand up the best, like EVERYBODY\\"S BEEN BURNT.  A beautiful surreal ballad about the universiality of heartbreak, in a 5/4 beat. WHAT? That was considered \\"new\\" when Jethro Tull used it two years later for LIVING IN THE PAST. Renascance Fair was just as beautiful, and both of those songs seem to me like High Points in David Crosby's writing. (Along with TRIAD). Then, you have the SCI FI epics like C.T.A.-105, which is about....Alien consciousness I guess. If the album has a \\"theme\\", its summed up in the last song,\\" WHY?\\" The album starts with the sell out mentality of ROCK AND ROLL STAR (a huge favorite of Patti Smith, and anyone who has been thru the rock meat grinder), love songs, fantasies, scifi UFOs, LSD visions, (Mind Gardens, an experiment that didnt work as well as others), a mandatory Dylan cover on these early Byrd's albums (MY BACK PAGES, which again was about the look back at adolescent arrogance), and ending with WHY? Because to me, the band was asking that question thruout this album. Doesnt the best art always ask WHY? I'm not calling this the best song on the album, but rather, it does call into focus, the questioning of the Hippie generation, about War, and the whole American dream of oppulence, excess leading to death, that was given out wholesale, without anyone asking WHY? WHY DOES THIS APPLY TO ME? WHY SHOULD I GO TO VIETNAM? WHY SHOULD I STAY STRAIGHT? WHY GET MARRIED? or whatever other WHY you could add in there. So, this is TRULY the CD you want to start out with, if you want to hear what the Psychedelic, highest flying BYRDS were about, before they left psychedelia and nascent folk rock behind them forever, for the reinvention of country and western rock, which was also hugely influencial for decades to come.

0452289963|5.0|I believe Echart Tolle to be the finest thinker of our time.  I had read \\"The Power of Now\\" and expected that nothing could top it.  When I read the claims of \\"transforming your life & finding your life's purpose\\" I assumed those came from a  publisher to sell books.  How wrong I was.  This book is nothing less than it claims and so much more.  I have stepped into  A New Earth.  Biblical passages have opened to me as never before.  It did more than \\"change/transform\\" my life.  It not only showed me how to transcend my life of before, it took me into The New Earth I am living now.
0393316041|5.0|My son recommended I read this one and I'm glad he did.  Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! offers a fascinating look into the life of one of the brightest minds of the past 100 years.  Richard Feynman is probably best known for his involvement in the Manhattan Project and for winning the Nobel Prize in Physics but this book is more about who he was as a person.<br /><br />Unlike some dull and dreary book on the science shelf, Surely You're Joking is an extremely enjoyable read, thanks in large part to Feynman's conversational writing style.  The author's curiosity also shines through and it's easy to see why he was such a brilliant scientist; he clearly was one of those kids who spent a lot of time taking things apart and learning how they worked.<br /><br />This book is a timeless adventure through the highlights of Feynman's adult life.  It's filled with stories of his time at Cornell, CalTech and of course, his work on the bomb.  Although you won't learn much about science from this book, it will definitely give you a better appreciation for the man and what made him tick.

0061148512|5.0|Sylvia Plath's, The Bell Jar, is a novel that will take you into the world of Esther Greenwood. A young girl clinging to straws trying to find her place in the world. The language that Plath uses is simple yet vivid, taking you into the mind of a depressed girl. From beginning to end you follow the journey from the unknown purpose in life into something much deeper and much more dark.     The sentences start as if in the mind of a sane person and begin to subtly change into the mind of someone with a darkness setting in and leaving you with the eerie feeling that something is happening...but you aren't quite sure what.     The vivid language stays with you and the characters that move in and out of Esther's life have a lasting effect on the reader, just as they have had on her.    The beginning of the novel starts \\"It was a queer and sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted the Rosenbergs, and I didn't know what I was doing in New York.\\" This simple sentence thrusts you into Esther's life and you will not forget the journey of a young girl sitting in the bell jar trying to escape.
B0010X745K|3.0|Stephen King is one of those hit and miss authors who has managed to keep readers and viewers entertained with his imaginings for over two decades. Devoted King readers will definetly feel his prescence from almost the first frame of the film, where the movies protagonist/hero, played by Thomas Jane, is painting a canvas depicting King's well-known Dark Towers character, The Gunslinger.<br /><br />  I don't want to get into a thorough review of the film since most people know what it's about from the summary. I just want to give my overall opinion on whether or not I liked it. And I did. For the most part.<br /><br />  The film is definetly entertaining. Definetly scary. Definetly has some gore-moments. But, surprisingly, the scariest thing about the movie isn't the blood, guts or even the creatures.<br />It's the tension and actions created by the characters themselves that make us cringe.<br /><br />  King is a master at exposing human nature for what it really is. He gives viewers a fairly accurate depiction of what people would really do in the most dire of circumstances. And it's NOT pretty. King's main usage of stirring up conflict amongst the characters shines through Marcia Gay-Harden's maniacal Christian Crusader, Mrs. Carmody.<br />Mrs. Carmody is one of modern horror's greatest villians in my opinion. Her acts of proselytizing the desperate survivors is eerily realistic and supremely scary. She was the most frightening part of this film for me.<br /><br />  I liked the beginning and middle of this film and loved the underlying messages that King littered throughout it. It's a truly profound horror film in the sense that it actually comes chock-full-of political statements and even religious views, and despite the cheesy CGI graphics, it had a shocking impact on me.<br /><br />  It's definetly worth watching. The only thing I can say is that the ending is a huge let down. I literally felt like crying. It was a seriously depressing, downright-somber end to a horror film and it left me shaking my head in shock.<br /><br />  Really, truly one of the saddest endings to a horror film (or ANY other film for that matter) that i have ever seen in my life. EVER.<br /><br />  That said, The movie was good. It's an emotional thrill ride filled with lots of scares, excellent acting from a fairly famous cast, and a ton of glimpses into the human mind.<br /><br />  I wish the ending was different in any way other than the way it was and I would have given it 5 stars. I just don't like when a scary-thriller leaves me teary eyed and depressed.<br /><br />  I will most likely be shaking my head in disbelief at this film for a couple of days. Which, is probably a sign that it's a good movie just for the simple fact that it disturbed me.<br /><br />  I definetly recommend this film!g my head in shock.

0307277887|3.0|Well, first of all I must confess that I read this book after mauling through the entire first season of TV series in two sittings.  I suppose that means, among other things, that I became attached to the characterizations set forth in the show and was therefore somewhat let down by Lindsay's different, and often paper-thin, versions of everyone that inhabits Dexter's world.  While Dexter himself is fleshed out nicely (The entire book consists of his narration, so there was really no way around fleshing him out.), almost all of the other characters are cardboard cutouts.  Even Rita, whose complete gentleness provides the perfect foil for Dexter in the show, exists in the novel as nothing but some vaguely defined voice on the phone who has maybe five lines in the entire book.  I'm used to TV characters being mere shadows of the deep portrayals we're treated to in print, but that is far from the case here.    Would I have liked the book better had I not seen the TV series first?  Honestly, I'm not sure.  While the premise - a serial killer who hunts other murderers while working as crime scene analyst - remains extremely interesting, the actual execution leaves a lot to be desired.  While the novel has quite a bit of sardonic humor, it also stretches the already somewhat tenuous plausibility of the subject matter too thin in more than a few places.  Dexter's \\"sense\\" about the serial killer that serves as the book's villain is trotted out too frequently as a deus ex machina, and the ending of the novel (the last three chapters or so) seems painfully rushed and awkward.      This is extra disappointing because the novel starts out so strongly, opening with a taut sequence in which Dexter abducts a child-killer and holds him accountable for his crimes.  If the rest of the book maintained that caliber of prose and storytelling, I'd be raving about it.  Sadly, there's a sense in which the only scenes in the book that really \\"work\\" are the ones involving Dexter's crimes, while the rest of the novel metamorphoses into a bizarre quasi-cartoon in which our hero cracks too many jokes at the expense of the caricatures that surround him.  Maybe this difference is intentional, but I'm not entirely satisfied with it.  As I've already stated, I found the ending to be extremely unsatisfying, mostly because it comes from so far out of left field.  I'm of the school of thought that a mystery novel should provide the astute reader with the tools to figure out \\"whodunit\\" on their own, but 'Darkly Dreaming Dexter' allows us no such luxury.  It honestly feels as if Lindsay got to the end, couldn't figure out where to go with his story, and just wrote the first thing that came into his mind.    I desperately wanted to like this book.  As entertaining as the TV show is, I had expected the novel to be an absolute masterpiece. (Or at least a more enjoyable read.)  Sadly, it is not.  This is one of the few times when a TV adaptation improves upon the source material.  Is 'Darkly Dreaming Dexter' a terrible book?  No.  It's an okay book.  But it never really manages to make it past that.

B000PC0U1W|5.0|Every once in a while a film comes along that provokes your way of thinking. Fight Club did that in the 90's and this movie does that for this decade. The story follows Evy Hammond (Natalie Portman), who meets a radical who calls himself V, and dressed in the likeness of Guy Fawkes. V exposes the tyranny and treason behind the futuristic government of Norsefire, which rules England with an iron fist. V teaches Evy how to not live in fear of the government, and all the while his plan unfolds to bring a revolution and freedom to the country. There's not a bunch of violence, but when there is you are at full attention to the beautiful directing and cinematography. Oh, and did I mention Hugo Weaving is V? The man known as Agent Smith from The Matrix Trilogy and Elrond from LOTR, is at the top of his game. I love everything about this movie and I highly recommend it to everyone.
0937381888|5.0|It is hard to say anything about this book that others haven't already said. But I think the book deserves another five star review and I'll just try to explain why I like it so much.  This is a book written for a beginner, but it never gets condescending or preachy. Palmer is a first-rate teacher.  He gives the new brewer all the right rules and warnings about sanitation, oxidation, autolysis, pitching rates and so forth, but always with a nice sense of perspective.  He never gives the impression that the world will come to an end (or even that your beer will be undrinkable) if you make a \\"mistake.\\"  He knows his subject and never waters down his explanations, yet the book never comes across like a textbook. Reading this book gave me confidence that I could make good beer on the first try.  When I bought the book, I had no intention of making all-grain beer, but he made it sound so interesting that I ended up doing all-grain batches too.  And although I ask more experienced brewers for advice, this book remains the only systematic explanation of brewing that I've ever needed.  A really good book!
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|(4.5 *'s) `Accelerate' is R.E.M.'s best effort in ages.  Surely meant to put them back in the limelight, the C.D. puts the pedal to the metal and seldom stops to look back.  Reminiscent of some of the evocative folk of '[[ASIN:B000002MG1 Automatic for the People]],' the new songs, draw more from the power of '[[ASIN:B0006IIPFS Monster (CD + DVD+ A) (Dig)]]' and the most progressive songs from '[[ASIN:B000002N9S New Adventures in Hi-Fi]]'.  Especially in comparison to 'Monster,' these selections are more fluid and fast-forward than their aforementioned predecessors.  The best comparison is to say these songs are their most engaging power pop since `[[ASIN:B00093IPPA Life's Rich Pageant]]'.    As usual some of their lyrics are as elusive as their band name suggests, but you don't have to have to go through the printed words with a fine-toothed come, either.  For the finger-wagers, they jump-start the album with the worthy \\"Living Well Is the Best Revenge\\".  Turning the tables on the judgers, Michael Stipe sonorously sings:     \\"Don't turn your talking points on me./ History will set me free./ The future is ours/ And you don't even rate a footnote.\\"    On \\"Man-Sized Wreath\\"* Peter Buck continues his admirable guitar snarl for a song about the tug-of-war between repression and attainment of \\"carpe diem\\".  (At least that's what I think it means.)  Unless the song resonates about believing what is true beyond popular deception--in which case there are plenty of images recalling \\"Begin the Begin,\\" a theme that resonates often for their post 9/11 R.E.M. observations on the entire C.D.    The best song is the one that debuted early, \\"Supernatural Superserious,\\" where they find their best groove (and probably their best single) in at least a decade.  It is an infectious tune that invites teens (and everyone else) to have the courage to be oneself despite the temptation to be on stage and perform for others.  (And speaking of stages, their drummer seems to fit the bill, givingthe songs the thrust they've been lacking since the departure of Bill Berry.)     In the slower gears, they still have perfectionist layers with the Tex-Mex folkie-flavored \\"Houston,\\" a call to hope, and the truly beautiful \\"Until the Day Is Done,\\" which scotches the pensive beauty of \\"I Wanted to Be Wrong\\" from their middle-of-the-road predecessor, 'Around the Sun'.         Not content to simply commiserate about today's crisis, they look to hope in \\"Sing for the Submarine,\\" probably their most idiosyncratic cut.  Using the R.E.M. trademark of dreaming, they resolve to \\"pick it all up and start again\\" after fighting against despair (\\"...This is where you give into the machine/ Lift up your voice, feel gravity's pull,/ And drown out the sirens' ring.)  Echoing this theme of enlightened nonconformity is \\"Mr. Richards,\\" a portrait of populist leader (and a flashback to \\"World Leader Pretend\\" from '[[ASIN:B000002LFU Green]]') who is all bluster and no substance (\\"Mr. Richard you're forgiven/ For a narrow lack of vision/ But the fires are still raging on.\\")      R.E.M. has never shied away from social and political commentary, but in a few short songs, they find recourse in love and music.  In one of their best propulsive songs since \\"Departure,\\" \\"Horse to Water\\" expresses regrets when desire is tainted by harm.  (\\"You lead a horse to water, and you watch him drown.\\")  No less revealing is \\"Hollow Man,\\" a confessional about those \\"loose lips\\" situations that flatten the spirits in lovers' lives.       Ending the album ably, \\"I'm Gonna DJ\\" is another progressive gem that jubilantly speaks of music laying down heaven on earth.  Taking some of the vintage ideas and musical motifs in their past, R.E.M. goes \\"back to the future\\" and fast-forwards with some of their most accessible music in years.  Indeed if 'Accelerate' doesn't take this band back to the top, it is hard to imagine anything else will.        (*At the Sasquatch Festival in George, WA, Michael Stipe introducedthe song, telling the audience that the lyric was about his indignation toward President Bush during a recent tribute to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King where he lay a wreath at the grave site of the late civil rights leader. \\"Begin the Begin\\" states \\"tiger run around the tree/Run, turn, and then follow,\\" a line in reference to blind followers of authority (allegedly the late Jerry Falwell), a closer interpretation of \\"Man-sized Wreath\\" than \\"carpe diem\\".)

B000001EAQ|5.0|Horribly underrated! Pop is U2's most provocative album; it is ambitious, groundbreaking and deep. The music is awesome! Many devout U2 fans just could not handle the change in style, given the U2 pedigree up to this point. But this album features not only a wonderful new style, but the best damn lyrics Bono ever wrote.<br /><br />\\"Discoteque\\" is a very fun, complex song. It features some of the best music the band ever wrote, and puts one in a \\"party\\" like mood. This sets the wanted tone, which is that of \\"taking what you get, because it's all you can find\\". The subsequent listenings will help the listener to understand this is Bono's parable not unlike \\"The Wanderer\\" from Zooropa. \\"Do You Feel Loved\\" is among the same lines; it is a look at superficial love and peoples lives just slipping through their fingers as they waste time. \\"If God Will Send His Angels\\" is not only beautiful, but poignant. It seems to tell a similar story as the first couple of tracks, but from an outside point of view. This is also Bono's real point of view. This is his portrait of the human condition in the post-modern world, where \\"the cartoon network turns into the news\\" and \\"Jesus was put in show business\\". It is more or less a prayer that spirituality will overcome the material world.<br /><br />Cue \\"The Playboy Mansion\\" and \\"Miami\\". Miami is more of a portrait from that same outside point of view, where \\"surgury is in the air\\" and \\"big girl with the sweet tooth watches skinny girl in the photo shoot\\". Plus, the electronic drum beat and the ripping sound of Edge's guitar is some of the coolest music on the album. \\"The Playboy Mansion\\" is, like \\"Discoteque\\", true, but more subtly in its satirical telling of conditions. But it is two-fold. The song also stands as a bit of an allegory for finding spiritual enlightenment, which, as a paradox, makes complex and in my mind, one of the best songs. \\"It's who you know that gets you through the gates of that mansion...\\"<br /><br />Then there is \\"Gone\\" and \\"Last Night in Earth\\". Again, two different characterizations. \\"Gone\\" is the honest Bono, talking about the life and dullness of true celebrity. \\"Last Night On Earth\\" is the character trapped inside the spiritless life, who trys to live as if it was his last night on earth. He \\"is not waiting on a savior to come\\", and also realizes \\"she'll be dead soon and then she'll sleep\\".<br /><br />\\"Staring at the Sun\\" is also complex, but very likeable. Of any song on the album, it seems the most likely to me to be a hit single. What more do I say about this one? Great music and great lyrics. This is true Bono view again. Read the lyrics and think Plato.<br /><br />\\"It You Wear That Velvet Dress\\" seems to me to not fit in thematically with the other songs, but this should bother you not. The music is wonderful. It is so atmospheric. This is one of the most intense and sexual sounding love songs I have ever heard. Edge's guitar is like a single, sexy voice that utters something but once and is followed audibly only by echoes and tingles in the listeners' ears. Bono's voice is so amazing and sexual. This is the kind of performance that makes me realize that I do indeed like women, because if I didn't, I would know it while listening to him.<br /><br />\\"Mofo\\", \\"Please\\", and \\"Wake Up Dead Man\\" are hands down three of the best from the U2 catalogue ever. \\"Mofo\\" stands as one of the most complicated songs musically and lyrically for the men. It utters mixed themes; searching for love and spirituality and mourning the loss of a Mother are among them. \\"Please\\" is about violence and the lack of peace in the world. Again, it doesn't to me seem to fit thematically with the other songs about searching or not searching for God, but it remains as my favorite song on the album. \\"Wake Up Dead Man\\" is the most beautifully heartbreaking and poignant song ever written by U2. It is the honest Bono, and maybe in some way, the other character, having come to grips with the material and spiritual world crashing down around them. This does not end on a happy note. This is a heartwrenching song. It is a confession that the world is awful and human beings are a mistake. It is not only a confession, but a longing; where is the light and the hope (go back to \\"If God Will Send His Angels\\")?<br /><br />If there is one U2 cd worth analyzing and giving hard thought to, this is certainly it. It is one of my favorites, and I cannot recommend it highly enough to anyone.<br /><br />Peace.does not end on a happy note. This is a heartwrenching song.

B0000A118M|5.0|John Coltrane wrote and recorded his work, \\"A Love Supreme\\" after having an intense spiritual awaking and often stated that he believed the album to be his musical love letter to God. The album is probably, next to \\"Blue Train,\\" Coltrane's best known work by the world as a whole. While I belong to the point of view that everyone of Coltrane's works was a work of genius and that they were all truely works of great art, \\"A Love Supreme\\" ranks as one of my favorite Coltrane albums. The music on the album is amazing in it's mixing of moving melodies and ballad-like moments and intense and passionate experimentation that would become a standard in Coltrane's later works. The piece as a whole truely feels as if one is going through Coltrane's spiritual awakening as well as one moves through the stages that each of the pieces that make up the album is named after. I have always believed that there was a special significance to the art of music and it being perhaps the only art form that can bring natural in contact with the divine and Coltrane's work is truely proof of this theory. Whether you are new to Coltrane or jazz in general, you can't go wrong with picking \\"A Love Supreme\\" as a strarting point.

I've owned the DVD since the day it was released and I've already watched it several times with friends and family. It'll be viewed by me, many times in the future.<br /><br />If you are a fan of gangster films (not gang bangers), Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe...you will be entertained and suffer no buyer's remorse.
B000XTLUW0|5.0|In the new millennium Muse together with Gomez, Mercury Rev, Elbow, Coldplay and The Flaming Lips (from \\"Soft Bulletin\\" (1999) onwards) were the bands that really excited me the most. (Previous to these recent years Kings X and Dream Theater \\"did it for me\\" in the 90's, Marillion were \\"my 80's\\" band together with Simple Minds, Big Country, Waterboys and U2. My 70's favorites were largely Genesis and Rush.    This live album from 2007 is a fantastic CD / DVD set (please see track listing as part of the \\"product information\\" above. 10 of the 13 tracks on the CD (and 13 of the19) (not including the \\"Intro\\" bit) Muse played live when they played in Auckland New Zealand in November 2007 (where they opened with \\"Take a bow\\" and closed with \\"Knights of Cydonia\\" - the reverse of this set.  The CD (from the 16th June show) is 70 minutes of the greatest live music I have heard. The songs are very live in feel, passion and energy. The crowd is great and has been mixed in brilliantly, it really has a great live feel. The DVD is the whole 17th June show (thus 6 more tracks than the CD) is sounds fantastic. Visually it is at times just too much to take in (I mean that in appositive sense, there is just so much happening).     This is also a great companion disc to the bands previous live disc (Hullabaloo - 2002 in support of the \\"Origin of Symmetry\\" CD (2001) with tracks from that CD and\\" Showbiz\\" (1999). On this new one we get 6 tracks from \\"Black Holes and Revelations\\" (2006), 4 from \\"Absolution\\" (2004), 2 from \\"Origin\\" (2001) and 1 from \\"Showbiz\\" (1999). The only \\"repeat\\" (ie that was already on \\"Hullabaloo\\" is \\"Micro Cuts\\" (from\\"Origin\\").    The band give a superb performance throughout, just brilliant. I can't speak highly enough of this set. For me Muse are THE band of the new millennium, in terms of their ability / freshness/ willingness to take risks and passion for what they do. 75,000 looked and sounded like they loved every minute...     On a personal note I enjoy playing drums (I'm only average myself) and I was fascinated with the playing ability of Dominic Howard - brilliant. He plays a very compact transparent kit which looks great on the DVD with the various lighting effects.     I really enjoy his very heavy bass sounding style (Single kick, with three floor toms - oneon his high hat side) with the snare and singular rack tom providing the contrasts. It is just a great sound.    Certainly one of the great live albums of the new millennium from one of the great bands of these modern times, a tremendous experience in today's age - real musicians playing real instruments and playing with energy and passion in front of a very appreciative 75,000 at Wembley Stadium, in London, England.    I really enjoyed this CD (and DVD), if this sounds remotely like your sort of thing, go for it, it's a top notch effort and has joined my personal list of \\"Great Live albums\\" that I've enjoyed over the last 30 years.     - \\"Live at the Fillmore\\" from Allman Brothers Band (1971)  - \\"How the West was won\\" from Led Zeppelin (1972)   - \\"Made in Japan\\" from Deep Purple (1972)   - \\"Yessongs\\" from Yes (1973)   - \\"Welcome back my friends\\" from ELP (1973)   - \\"Too late to stop now\\" from Van Morrison (1974)   - \\"On your feet or on your knees\\" from Blue Oyster Cult (1975)   - \\"Live in London\\" from Bruce Springsteen (1975)   - \\"One more from the Road\\" from Lynyrd Skynrd (1976)   - \\"Frampton comes alive\\" from Peter Frampton (1976)   - \\"Live Bullet\\" from Bob Seger (1976)   - \\"Seconds Out\\" from Genesis (1977)   - \\"A Live Record\\" from Camel (1978)   - \\"Bursting Out Live\\" from Jethro Tull (1978)   - \\"Two for the Show\\" from Kansas (1978)   - \\"Playing the fool\\" Gentle Giant (1978)   - \\"Waiting fro Columbus\\" from Little Feat (1978)   - \\"Strangers in the Night\\" from UFO (1979)   - \\"Live Rust\\" from Neil Young (1979).   - \\"Paris\\" from Supertramp (1980).   - \\"Exit...Stage left\\" from Rush (1981)   - \\"Under a blood red sky\\" from U2 (1983)   - \\"Stop making sense\\" from Talking Heads (1984)   - \\"Live in the city of Light\\" from Simple Minds (1986)   - \\"Live adventures of the Waterboys\\" from the Waterboys (1986)   - \\"Operation Livecrime\\" from Queensryche (1991)   - \\"Without a safety Net\\" from Big Country (1992)   - \\"Secret World Live\\" from Peter Gabriel (1994)   - \\"Together in Concert\\" from Tim Finn, Dave Dobbyn, Bic Runga (2000)   - \\"Lve at the Greek\\" from Black Crowes and Jimmy Page (2000)   - \\"Live Scenes from New York\\" from Dream Theater (2000)   - \\"Hullabaloo\\" from Muse (2002)   - \\"Live in Rio\\" from Rush (2002).  - \\"Out West\\" from Gomez (2005)   - \\"Instant Delivery\\" from Flower Kings (2006).  - \\"Score - 20th Anniversary\\" from Dream Theater (2006)  - \\"Freak 'n' Roll - into the fog\\" from Black Crowes (2006)   - \\"Okonokos\\" from My Morning Jacket (2006).  - \\"HAARP\\" from Muse (2007).
B000YCLRBA|5.0|This is a fabulous version of this opera.  I saw the real thing in person, not with Fleming, but with Hvorostovsky, and this DVD just captures the entire experience.  It is a wonderful production and should not be passed by if you even like this opera only a little  - beautiful music and incredible voices.
B000SFJWLU|4.0|Mr. Censored pretty much said it all, but I'm gonna say what I have to say anyway. Five Finger Death Punch are a great metal band that combines a bunch of people from various other bands into an amazing new band.    Right from the start, they grab hold and beat the crap outta you with their relentlessly fast and heavy music. This feeling permeates the entire album, and doesn't let up at all.    The biggest problem I think I have is just the length. It's only 38 minutes long, with ten tracks. That equates to about 3:48 per song. Honestly, song length isn't the problem, they just need more songs on here.    What's great about this band is that the vocals aren't just screams. Ivan Moody is one of the few people who can do both screams and clean singing really well.    So essentially, if you want an album that has nothing but fast, loud, in-your-face songs, you'll want this album.

B000A2W1X2|5.0|The plot is very lean and simple, which leaves all the room for the actors to fill it up with fine, understated performances.  Sophie Marceau is stunningly beautiful as usual, but her subtle charm and direct candor are perfectly matched to this role, giving depth and life to a character in a very lonely setting.  I own several of her films, this is hands-down the only english speaking role of hers worth repeat viewing.
B0013BNY2Q|4.0|I'm a little perplexed by some of the less-than-flattering reviews. I would never suggest that any accomplished band be given a free pass for a sub-par release or a self-indulgent return to one's roots, but I hardly think calling recording quality into question justifies a poor review for Accelerate. Everyone loved Franz Ferdinand's clever vibe, The Shins eclectic bent, the Killers raw simplicity. Are we to never again accept such endeavors from R.E.M. now that they can afford good mics, top engineers and endless studio time?    The truth is, an endless litany of club and college bands owe their far shorter-lived legacies directly to R.E.M. (I'm talking to you, Franz Ferdinand!). Accelerate is as good as anything these one-album-wonders have managed to write and better than most. After so many years, to be so inimitably inventive and undeniably relevant, R.E.M. are as brilliant as ever, and so is Accelerate.    So, be jaded and unjustifiably critical if you must. Just don't criticize out of context while regurgitating crap you read from Pitchfork elitists. It really is OK to like R.E.M. after all these years and if you're afraid enjoying Accelerate makes you seem simple, don't be. It just means you still have good taste.
B0011HOEY4|4.0|Densel Washington's best acting to date. Worth watching more than one time. Vintage sets and autos add to the realism. There wasn't anything about this movie that I didn't like.
B0015GF4FO|4.0|The series is thought provoking and very well acted.  The characters express themselves credibly and draw you into their lives without effort.  While sharing therapy with these patients, one is sure to find an issue which will strike home.
B00007KWHP|5.0|I just want to start my review by saying thank you, Rhino. In 2003, the entire Yes Atlantic catalog (with the exception of 1987's 'Big Generator') was reissued and remastered by Rhino. And it's much easier to appreciate their music because of it.    'Fragile' is a legendary record. Keyboardist Tony Kaye had left the group, and Rick Wakeman, a former member of Strawbs, was named Kaye's replacement. He made his debut with the group in late-1971 with a cover of Simon & Garfunkel's 'America,' which was released on the Atlantic various artists compilation 'The Golden Age of Atlantic.'    Shortly after the compilation was released, the group cut their most famous record of the 1970s, 'Fragile.' The record is probably most famous for including the classic rock radio staples 'Roundabout' and 'Long Distance Runaround.'    But, what makes this record a standout to me isn't the fact that the songs are among the best songs Yes ever wrote (which they are), but the fact that this is probably their most experimental. Take 'Cans And Brahms.' It's one of Wakeman's best keyboard solos period, and what makes it even more interesting is that it's a cover--of a classical music piece.    And, another fine example is the 38-second (yes, I said second) long 'Five Per Cent For Nothing.' It's just a jam session of the four members (there are no vocals). Now if only it was longer...    And my last and final example is 'We Have Heaven.' It's Steve Howe adding short guitar riffs, while Jon Anderson experiments with vocals. It's ranks with one of my favorite Yes songs.    The bonus tracks are great. Of course, true Yes fans already own 'America' from their 1974 compilation 'Yesterdays.' But the early mix of 'Roundabout' is very interesting and is slightly different from the album version.    Overall, this is highly recommended for any Yes fan. One of their best by a long shot. ENJOY!!!
0793518326|4.0|This is not a beginner's chord book. It contains the music for all the recorded Beatle songs-but not the ones they wrote and gave to other artists. The scores are broken down by instrument ie the bass part, guitar II, etc. The accuracy level is pretty good, but I have found several mistakes. Despite that, you can learn a lot from this book about how to play these songs correctly, and in the original key. Want to know that sweet little turnaround lick from \\"Here Comes The Sun\\"? This is the place (hint-capo 7th fret).   The print is very small, and does not lend itself to sight-reading. It's better to just figure out the part, then put the book away, and play!
006441034X|5.0|This book is like a cool summer breeze.  So refreshing that when you are finished with it, you'll sit back and sigh.    This story is wonderful: filled with wit, humor, quirkiness, magic, and of course, love.  It is such a wonderful adventure that when it finally ends you will find yourself back on page 1.  It is definitely worth \\"exploiting.\\"    I won't tell you anything more about this story than to encourage you to read it.  This book is an adventure--one that tickles all your fancies; besides, isn't that what any fantastical journey is supposed to do?
B000HEVALC|5.0|I recommend this disc to those who love the early roots of Rock n' Roll as it was in the early 50's. Also, to anyone who wants to hear gospel music sung well and with spirit. Elvis' gifts are demonstrated on this recording better than on the polished and highly edited recordings we commonly hear.  These guys were having a great time and it comes across in each tract.  Their rendition of Lonesome Valley will dust off the cobwebs in the most cynical soul.
B000WZB944|1.0|First off, I should say that I consider \\"The Joshua Tree\\" a 4 1/2-5 star album, but this remaster is very poor.  Like many modern recordings, everything sounds compressed as hell.  In short, far too often, it sounds like I am listening with blankets thrown over my speakers; too many little nuances are either muffled or lost in the compressed mix.  The original sounded fabulous, but I guess the idea of a big money grab by remastering a classic was way too much to resist, and I guessed it work with me since I bought it, but to others who have not bought it yet and are thinking about it:    DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!  Stick with your copy of the original.  Since I still own my original copy, I know I will.
B00008WT5E|4.0|Over time, AC/DC's 1978 release, Powerage, has become their forgotten album. Released between the classic studio albums, Let There Be Rock and Highway to Hell respectively, Powerage is rarely mentioned among their better releases. In reality, it is stronger album than the bigger selling releases High Voltage and Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, and is more consistent than the bulk of the Brian Johnson albums. Powerage is best known for \\"Sin City\\", one of their best songs ever, which they still play live. However, there are a lot of other great tracks here including \\"Riff Raff\\", which features one of Angus Young's best riffs, the celebratory \\"Gimme a Bullet\\", the laid back \\"Gone Shootin'\\", and the opening anthem, \\"Rock and Roll Damnation.\\" Other strong tracks include \\"Down Payment Blues\\", another great anthem in \\"Up to My Neck in You\\", and the seething ode to breakups, \\"Kicked in the Teeth.\\" While not on the level of their classic albums (Let There Be Rock, Highway to Hell, Back in Black), Powerage is a very underrated release from the Australian quintet and is certainly worth checking out.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I first saw segments of Planet Earth on Discovery channel and was absolutely amazed at the footage they captured.  The animals and plants that they captured were so gorgeous.  I am in complete awe of the numerous animals and plants on this planet.  It is a shame that some of these rare and beautiful animals and plants may soon become extinct.  I have a new found appreciation for nature.
0793563836|5.0|This a very cool book, I've been playing guitar for a while and now I'm switching over to bass.  Learned to play bass on my own but I learned some bad habits and believe me bad habits or difficult to unlearn! But I'm trying to unlearn them with this book.  All by all great book with great basics!
B000002HAJ|5.0|Although many may argue that Disintergration is the best example of work by the Cure, Wish seems to convey an overall better display of what makes the Cure great.
B001661RC2|5.0|I was afraid that Dangermouse might \\"over-produce\\" these guys.  Man was I wrong.  May be the best thing that happened to them.  They were in a little rut the last couple of albums.  This one is great from beginning to end.  Like the other reviewer said, get this album and go see these guys live.  Favorite album of 2008 so far.

630471193X|4.0|In the movie phenomenon George (John Travolta) see a light in the sky in which knocks him off of his feet. As days and months go by he becomes smarter. He starts reading up to five books a day of all of his interest's languages, cars, love, nature etc. As more time goes on George then develops telekinesis. He starts moving objects with his mind in which he like to call it a \\"partnership\\" The whole town is chocked amazed, worried and scared for George because he is a well known respected man in town and everything he does is odd. George the ends up having a tumor in his brain and it is only a matter of time before he is deceased.     I think this movie is one my favorites because it's very interesting. It has a great attention getter and it's just fascinating. I highly recommend people either rent or buy this movie!!
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|Well guys and gals --- I bought Accelerate today off of Amazon MP3 Downloads and I am REALLY think this latest album from R.E.M. awesome.  I've been a fan for many years----and this new album brings me back to the \\"hay-day\\" of R.E.M. of the 90's (Automatic for the People / Monster, etc).<br /><br />It's new music---but a very familiar R.E.M. groove.<br /><br />I rate this as a 10 out of 10.  Great work R.E.M.<br /><br />-Will
B00110K62U|5.0|Les Miserables is the best play to begin with, the 10th Anniversary Dream Cast in Concert at London's Royal Albert Hall was a great way to enjoy the story and the music.  Absolutely amazing! We keep watching it over and over again!  If you've seen the play (or even if you haven't), you'll love this production.
B00005JPSM|1.0|Like many reviewers, I choose to write about films or music that I like. Not this time.<br />No Reservations MIGHT have gotten two stars from me if I hadn't seen Mostly Martha -- Catherine ZJ is easy on the eyes, though less so in htis movie... But this remake is slavishly true to its inspiration, even to the music, while lacking all real emotion or strength. And given that Mostly Martha is a remarkable movie, how could this movie ever have been made? Some sense of self-respect should have moved all involved in this version to petition to have their names removed from the credits.<br />Mostly Martha is funny at times, and tremendously powerful at others -- it's a sympathetic portrayal of grief and compulsiveness, all shown with such restraint that its impact is intensified. Martina Gedeck, as she proved in Lives of Others, is a tremendous actress. And the little girl is really good.<br />So either see Mostly Martha and skip this, or never see Mostly Martha so this won't be so awful.
0452289963|5.0|This is an incredible book and it changed my life and the lives of many others.  Eckert Tolle is an amazing author who helps us see the human condition as it really is and what our Life's Purpose was meant to be.
B000YPUFA6|4.0|Although I wasn't a fan of the first two films in the series, I decided to get this because it was recommended to me by a friend. Needless to say I wasn't disappointed. If you're after a popcorn \\"horror\\" flick with a difference then this is certainly the film for you.<br />I placed the word horror in quotation marks for a reason. I use the word horror in the classic context of something that is genuinely menacing, intimidating and is destined to give you nightmares e.g. The first Nightmare on Elm Street. This wasn't one of those movies that really sent the shivers down your spine, but it did have its moments where you would jump out of your skin and this is obviously something that is considered horror by todays standards.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich returns to the series as Alice who is now on the move through the desert because she has learned the Umbrella Corp can track her location by satellite. After the incident in Raccoon City in the previous installment the Umbrella Corporation was unable to contain the T-Virus. It quickly spread across the world drying up all the lakes and rivers and turning almost every living thing into a Zombie. The Umbrella Corporation seem to be the only organised group of humans not in a Zombified state. In an attempt to try and create a cure for what's left of humanity, Dr. Sam Isaacs is using Alice clones in an attempt to create a cure and help tame the zombies so as to create a viable work force.<br />All is not so sweet however as a group of roaming Raccoon City survivors lead by Claire Redfield are attacked by a huge flock of ravenous zombified crows. 5 are killed in the incident, but it could have been more if it weren't for Alice incinerating the flock by using her psionic powers which were gained from her bried imprisonment in the Umbrella facility.<br /><br />Overall this is a really good film and one of those popcorn flicks that you can enjoy with your friends. Although this isn't entirely based around the game storylines it's still a good stand alone movie and if the rumours are true, I can't wait for the fourth.ne movie and if the rumours are true, I can't wait for the fourth.
0452289963|5.0|This book shows you the futility of yielding to one's ego, and    presents the challenging task of staying genuinely in the Present.    I noticed after reading Tolle's work that I was more able to ACCEPT    this divine universe and to acknowledge our Being a collective part of it.    ----Joseph Barry, Ph.D.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I love this movie. Probably because I'm an old Beatles Fan, and I'm a sucker for a cute face (Sturgis).  However, I didn't know about it till my SO dragged me to see it.  The first scene made me think it was going to be \\"too avant gardish\\" for me.  But, I soon got sucked in. I liked it so much I went to see it again in the theater--I believe is shows better on a big screen.  Kudos to Julie for a very entertaining and enjoyable movie.  I bought a copy for me and one for a friend.
B000VGKDZA|3.0|Not worth the buy for a fan of stez and gilberto.  there's a small number of tracks, and track 1, the classic \\"the girl from ipanema\\" repeats later in the CD.  only a someone new to bossa nova, stez and gilberto might appreciate it.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|You really have to see the movie to appreciate the soundtrack.  I didn't understand why those 2 people were playing that horrible music on the Academy Awards.  However, once I saw the movie, everything was made clear and I couldn't wait for the CD to arrive.  Then, after hearing the music, you have to watch the movie again.  Don't miss either!
B00122M2QU|5.0|This CD gets me pumped. Great stuff. I can't wait to hear this live. Has a great thrash/speed/mosh theme to it. Looking forward to the future of the Brothers Cavalera!
0618918248|5.0|The author's INTENT is clear from the outset, and every supporting chapter is an ode to DESIGN with a distinct PURPOSE in mind. I don't think the author is very convincing (since he is in error on so many facts, and since his whole METHOD is directly contrary to his THESIS) but the way he attempts with obvious PREMEDITATION to accomplish his GOAL sings the praises of FORETHOUGHT at every turn. Ironic though it may be (considering his THEME) it is nevertheless certain that when it comes to getting things done, this author is a great proponent of PLANNING one's work and working one's PLAN. The whole piece -- from the shortest blurb on the back cover to the longest paragraph in the middle -- is a glorious tribute to the ways and means of INTELLIGENT DESIGN.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|Highly recommend. Rupert Graves and a fantastic ensemble cast to pull off this wonderful black comedy. Frank Oz did a great job.
B000X1Z0BU|4.0|The cover quotes a prominent Chicago Tribune reviewer as saying this may well be the best music film of our generation.  That alone made me expect it to suck.  But guess what?  I agree with the guy.<br /><br />Now I can analyze why, or I can quote the back cover, or I can do both.  But those words would probably make you less likely to watch this gem, not more.  So I'm stopping.<br /><br />I think it's excellent, like it says in my review title.  And that's all I can say.
0385338724|3.0|I was  little dissapointed, not near as entertaining as Becky. I was expecting more comedy, which is what I have come to expect from Ms Kinsella's books.  Still I was hooked till the pleasant end.
B0013BNY2Q|2.0|I had high expectations with Accelerate after a four year R.E.M. drought and given the lackluster release \\"Around the Sun.\\"  Certainly, this is more raw than we've seen from the band since \\"Monster.\\"  But this time around, with a few notable exceptions, the material is just not that strong.  Melody lines, except for the couple of ballads, are missing in favor of jamming the guitars and bass down our throats.  The recording quality is horrible, sounding much like it was recorded in someone's garage using cobbled together equipment vs. state of the art equipment in a decent studio. Perhaps they were trying to go for that 90's grunge vibe with heavy, mushy sounding bass drowning just about everything else out.  And clocking in at a paltry 35 minutes??  Not even giving the listener their money's worth to boot. C'mon guys, you can do much better than this.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|Got my product in only a few day. It works great just as advertised. I have no complaints. Great for anyone with back problems. So easy to use. It glides over the floor. Better on hard floors than carpet. Good for spot cleaning carpet.
B0000VCZKM|4.0|Loved, loved, loved this movie when it was first released in the early 80's, which is precisely why I purchased it, along with the soundtrack for my 3yo.  She loves it, too, and at this stage in her life is totally oblivious to the druken/sexual Miss Hannagin (now that I think of it, I was too, even at 13).  Why, oh why did they feel the need to have actors screaming GD several times at the end?? This makes me sick they had to cheapen a precious musical with very talented actors. Otherwise it is a classic in my book.  Oh, and I agree with others...much peripherial action is sadly lost due to the fullscreen rather than widescreen format.
B000YRY8BG|5.0|A couple of years ago, while reviewing \\"The Queen,\\" I wistfully semi-wished for a West Wing-type TV series set in the world of British politics.  Turns out such a series already existed, the BBC's 2003 series, \\"State of Play,\\" released at last on region one DVD.    Stephen Collins (David Morrissey) is a rising young hotshot Member of Parliament and chairman of the ostensibly independent Energy Select Committee.  On the same morning that his beautiful young research assistant Sonia dies under mysterious circumstances in a subway station, a teenage bag-snatcher is shot to death on the other side of London.  While investigating the teenage boy's death, newspaper reporters Cal McCaffrey (John Simm) and Della Smith (Kelly McDonald) realize that the youngster made a phone call to Sonia the morning they both died.  Further controversy arises when it's revealed Collins was romantically involved with his assistant.  There's another wrinkle: McCaffrey once managed the Collins election campaign; in the wake of scandal, the embattled MP and his estranged wife Anne (Polly Walker) both turn to the conflicted McCaffrey for shelter and sympathy.    From there, the drama gets increasingly complicated and messy; I won't give too much away (and have probably given away too much already).  The further Della, Cal, and their fellow journalists dig into the two deaths, the more scandal and conspiracy they uncover.  Part of the drama is political, part of it is personal, and all of it is riveting.  The script (six hour-long episodes) by Paul Abbott is taut and intelligent, allowing plenty of space for both plot and character, with a perfect balance of drama, humor, intrigue, and romance.  There's some nicely crunchy stuff in there about the dangerous mix of politics and big business and the importance of a free press, but those elements never overwhelm the narrative.  The suspense is spooled out perfectly over the six hours, and some of the action sequences are strongly reminiscent of thethree Bourne movies.  Once you start watching this series, it's *very* hard to stop.    The cast is large, and there's any number of sub-plots, but the writing and directing (David Yates) are so skillful and the characters so distinctive that it's no problem to keep track of everything.  Paying close attention to detail is a must; some clues are dropped in with diabolical subtlety.  The denouement and resolution hit all the right notes: the protagonists' ultimate victory comes at a huge personal cost.  The closing shot in particular is just aces.    With such strong material, the cast has to be at the top of their game, and it's a testament to the quality of this series that there's not one weak performance in the lot.  Morrissey achieves just the right mix of unlikeable and sympathetic, playing a man who seems to have willfully screwed up his life; Walker is particularly sharp as his wounded, angry wife.  The team of journalists has terrific rapport and camaraderie, an intelligent, warm, likeable bunch, led by their acerbic editor, Cameron Foster (Bill Nighy, simply brilliant).  Foster's scenes facing off against the local DCI (Philip Glenister) are especially fun.  Marc Warren has a great turn as an unsavory witness/ suspect in the two deaths; James McAvoy does strong work as a freelance reporter with something to prove.  There are dozens of excellent performances among the third and fourth tier players, and even the one-shot walk-on characters are cast with admirable care.    Special praise is due to John Simm for his outstanding work as Cal McCaffrey.  Cal is the heart of the story, its most sympathetic character, the guy viewers will instinctively root for--even when he does something incredibly stupid, it's impossible not to like him, to want things to work out for him.  Simm gives the character all sorts of tics and quirks and layers; he plays beautifully off the other actors (Cal's final confrontation with Stephen is just devastating); he's a presence even when he's not doing anything in particular.  It's just a wonderful, wonderful performance, a standout even in this uniformly stellar cast.    For icing on the cake, there's some eye-catching visuals, and the soundtrack has an edgy, urban vibe.  If the multitude of accents and Brit-slang proves too much, one can flip on the handy subtitles.  Disappointingly, the DVD set is very thin on extra features; I would have loved to see some interviews with the cast and crew.  Viewers with kids in the house should be aware that \\"State of Play\\" is definitely R-rated, with moderate amounts of sex, violence, and swearing, as well as characters who drink and smoke almost nonstop.    The DVD set was released in advance of a big-budget Hollywood adaptation that's due to hit cinemas next year.  With Helen Mirren and Russell Crowe in the cast, it might not be bad, but I'd nevertheless recommend giving the original a spin before checking out the re-make.
B000XTLUW0|5.0|Since a few years ago, every Muse record is a must. This is no exception. A double disk featuring the \\"Black Holes and Revelations\\" tour concert in Wembley. In a CD with the best songs and a DVD with an hour and a half of first rate footage.     Matthew Bellamy is a genius, in very sense of the word. He plays the piano and the guitar as a God, and sings with one of the widest ranges and higher registers in modern music.     In a fun note, the concert begins with \\"Knights of Cydonia\\" and finishes with \\"Take a bow\\", since they are respectively the last and first of their previous record.     Standouts: \\"Hysteria\\", \\"Time is running out\\", \\"Supermassive black hole\\" and the magnificent \\"Unintended\\" from early work: Showbiz.     The concert sounds great (the CD sound quality is better), and looks amazing. Only complaint: bad transfer resolution: with many pixelated objects and blurred images during the concert, specially in the fastest shots. Lets hope for a later HD Release of this concert. I'll buy it again!
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I did not have high hopes for this film. It is mercifully short (85 minutes), which almost merits a star by itself -- filmmakers today cannot just tell a story and be done with it. They think they must add layers and drag it on for over two hours.    The movie opens on a street corner somewhere in Ireland. A guy with a guitar is playing his modern folk tunes (what we'd now call \\"indie music\\") with his guitar case open for tips and contributions. After an altercation with a druggie who tries to steal his guitar case, cut to the nighttime, when he is wailing out a very personal song of woe, strumming loudly and emphatically. A young woman walks up and throws ten pence in his case, asking him if he wrote the song. An acquaintance is struck -- she is a Czehk immigrant who sells flowers on the street and does domestic cleaning. He's a vacuum cleaner repair man by day, working in his Dad's shop. But they both love to sing/play music, and dabble in writing it. Over the course of a couple of weeks, they work together to flesh out some songs he's written and record them, as the guy starts moving seriously toward trying to make it in the music biz.    This film is one of the most charming things I've seen in years. It is a small film, a simple story about simple people with dreams, struggling with heartache and poor circumstances, who create something together, and in the process learn a bit about themselves and find a sudden, new, and deep friendship and love. It is amazing how authentic and real it comes off, amazing because this was a tiny movie, probably shot on video instead of film, cheap to make, with unknown actors. Yet Hollywood cannot seem to make a film that takes the audience into a friendship with living, breathing, real characters that you can't help but have immense affection for by the time the final credits roll. I can't say it never happens, but usually I'm painfully aware of contrivances and manipulations, poorly disguised.    The central theme of the movie, the core around which everything revolves, is The Guy's songwriting and The Girl's collaboration with him in creating and performing it to make a demo recording. It is not really my kind of music. It is the music of simple feelings, performed by people who do not have perfect, trained voices. Forgive my Irish, but I'd call it \\"sad b*stard music,\\" because it's about heartache and longing and misunderstanding and reaching out for connection and love. The melodies are sometimes pretty, but it's main virtue is that it is sincere, if not often very poetic (by my standards). The great thing about it is that you can believe that these characters could write these songs, because they aren't that sophisticated. (Unlike the recent August Rush, where a child who has never played an instrument suddenly becomes a performing and composing prodigy. Talk about a leap.)    And that's what stands out about this movie. Sincerity. Hard to find in a modern motion picture. I may not watch this multiple times, but I found it very moving, in a positive way.     There is some bad language, perhaps authentic, but totally unnecessary. This could easily be redubbed and turned into a PG or even a G film.
6304806418|3.0|I remember seeing 'Evita' in the theaters when it came out in '98, and recently bought a home theater projector so thought I'd rent this film and watch it again.    So, here's a warning to those with widescreen TVs or projectors: This movie is widescreen but it is *not* anamorphic - that is, the picture doesn't widen to fill your whole TV screen.  It was released when most people owned square TV sets, so the widescreen image is set within a standard 4:3 ratio square.  In other words, if you try to watch this movie on your widescreen TV what you'll get is a square TV image with the widescreen image inside of it - MUCH smaller than an anamorphic image.    A pity really, because it's not a bad movie.  I'm baffled as to why they never remastered the film and gave it an anamorphic release; it's been ten years...
032147404X|5.0|If you are planning to get serious with your digital SLR this is a wonderful book to get you started. Many important aspects of photograpy are explained in a simple way, and if you follow the tips in this book you will actually take better pictures.    I don't allways find Kelby's jokes funny, but in this book they are mainly concentrated to the introduction to each chapter so you can easily skip them :-)    I have to add that I have also bought vol 2 of this book, and it seems equally good.
B0010X745K|4.0|This movie could have been a three star production very easily, but is rescued from mediocrity by the intriguing questions it raises.  Apparently a military experiment has gone awry, opening a pathway between dimensions or worlds.  A thick mist spills into the town near the military base, bringing with it monsters that are for the most part not fully revealed, thus heightening the fear for the townspeople and the tension for the audience.    The movie gets a little preachy almost immediately, with the first creature attack bringing a forced, almost stilted confrontation between the city slickers and the local rubes.  It's as if the director couldn't let the antagonism gradually build but pushes the characters right into it.  There is of course the kook Christian--an off-the-shelf character for so many Hollywood productions--who somehow convinces most of the people trapped in the grocery store that Judgment Day is at hand and sets up the internal drama of the film.  Most of the townspeople are portrayed as simpletons unable to resist the kook's self-portrayal as mouthpiece for God.    The U.S. military clearly had no hand in helping the producers of The Mist, likely because it was shown in so unflattering a light.  Unfortunately that meant a lack of genuine-looking military equipment--do MPs still drive around in Jeeps?  And the tank at the end wasn't an Abrams or look like its predecessor.     The level-headed folk have to escape the grocery story because the nutcases now believe that the monsters require human sacrifices (to satisfy God), and because of the fear that eventually the critters will figure out that plate glass windows aren't much of an obstacle to an easy lunch.  Pretty much everything that can go wrong does go wrong, both during the two days in the store and during the good guys' escape.    On the other hand the acting was pretty good, especially by Nathan Gamble, the protagonist's little boy.  He plays it perfectly and movingly, as a scared little kid who cries and sucks his thumb.  He can't let go of his father.  How refreshing to see a little kid portrayed as a little kid, not some smart-aleck know-it-all.  The boy lent real emotion and urgency to the situation the town folks found themselves in.    The movie also set off a train of thoughts about such a situation.  Except for the bugs, all the monsters appeared to be predators, but for predators to survive there must be prey.  Why didn't huge quantities of prey come through the door too?  You wondered if the monsters could step outside the mist (apparently not) and if not, why not.  And if the mist disappeared, would they too?  Indeed, at the end the mist does start to vanish and so too, it seems, do the monsters.   Putting yourself in the people's places, you might think that the first place you'd go to once out of the store would be to the military base, or the cop station, or any substantial brick or block building.  Instead our good guys drive around until out of gas and take pre-emptive measures to not be the critters' next snack.    The ending, as all the reviews note, is a depressing shocker.  I doubt people would so easily give up, but then it's pretty hard to know just how most of us would handle a vicious alien invasion.  Decent special effects, an effective use of tension, and a little philosophizing on man's nature help push this movie over the top into four star territory.
0517123207|5.0|It took 277 years for the Church to accept that the universe did not revolve around the Earth, from the publication of Copernicus' 'On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres' in 1543 to the Vatican's total repeal of the condemnation of the Copernican doctrine in the period 1820 to 1835.  If that's anything to go by as far as the speed with which the Church accepts new truths about the universe, none of us will be around to see the day Darwin is vindicated as one of humanity's guiding lights, as opposed to the Son of Satan.  Seldom in history has such a noble person been subjected to such vilification.  It reminds one of the ridicule once heaped on supporters of the Copernican theory, and their disbelieving mockery - how could the Earth possibly revolve without the people flying off?  Today we all can only laugh at their ignorance, but only some of us can laugh at the ignorance of those 'Flat-Earthers' who still disregard Darwin's theory.  Like many have already pointed out, much of the material that fuels the evolution debate is not to be found in this book.  There are no claims or even insinuations in the book of descent from apes.  Rather, it was disciples like Huxley who really helped focus the debate on man's primate anscestry, and Darwin was far more direct in his beliefs in his later books such as 'The Descent of Man' and 'The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals', both of which are worth reading as they bolster his theory in countless ways, always combining a penetrating natural observation with intelligent analysis.  In fact, I must admit to enjoying them even more than this book, although of course as Darwin's classic, it's a must read for anyone interested in man's evolution, and no open-minded person could possibly remain unconvinced after going through Darwin's evidence and arguments against spontaneous creation.  (Creationists still believe that God came down to Earth in 19th century industrial revolution England to create the darker moths which started appearing as the trees gradually darkened from pollution, kindly making sure they did not stick out like sore thumbs on the blackened trees anymore...)ch started appearing as the trees gradually darkened from pollution, kindly making sure they did not stick out like sore thumbs on the blackened trees anymore...)
1404309721|5.0|Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson discuss what can be deduced from a walking stick left behind by a visitor. When the visitor returns he tells of the old legend about the hound of the Baskerville family, and how Sir Charles Baskerville died recently. Dr. James Mortimer found the footprints of a gigantic hound twenty yards from the body! There have been sightings of a huge hound on the moors at night. A new heir, Sir Henry Baskerville, arrives from Canada to take over the Baskerville property; he is the last of the line. Will he meet the same evil fate? Holmes makes an appointment to meet Sir Henry the next day. Holmes peers over the Ordnance map of that area. Has any crime been committed (Chapter 3)? Sir Henry tells of a warning letter sent to his hotel; who knew he was there? Why would anyone steal just one of his new boots? Would anyone follow Sir Henry? Dr. Watson will accompany Sir Henry back to Baskerville Hall; there is less danger in a small village than in London. Dr. Watson must keep his revolver near and never relax his precautions (Chapter 6).<br /><br />The moor country is described as wild and sparsely settled. Dr. Watson reports his observations of the people who meet with Sir Henry. Watson sees the dangers of the great Grimpen Mire when a pony is caught in a bog and killed. There are stone huts from prehistoric man. Watson meets Stapleton the naturalist and then his beautiful sister (who tells him to go back to London). Stapleton had once been a schoolmaster (Chapter 7). Watson sends letters to Holmes in London (Chapter 8). Mr. Frankland has a passion for litigation. He also observes the country with a telescope on his roof. Why was Stapleton so angry (Chapter 9)? What was the secret of the Barrymores? Watson meets Laura Lyons and hears her secret story (Chapter 11). What did she hold back? Mr. Frankland observed the stone huts. Then Watson hears a terrible scream from the moor (Chapter 12). Holmes has the solution to a cold-blooded murder, but lacked definitive proof. Holmes studied the portrait of the wicked Sir Hugo. Then plans are made for the night's activities. Will an unexpected fog create a complication? Holmes, Watson, and Lestrade rescue Sir Henry from a murderous fate. The villain escaped to a hiding place on the moor, but justice wasn't cheated. Chapter 15 ties up the loose ends.<br /><br />This may be the most popular of Doyle's four Holmes novels. It does not involve a religion, a company town, or imperial looting. Did Doyle implicitly criticize a hereditary aristocracy that passed down evils to each generation? The character traits of the villain seem like those in true crime stories.

B0009S4IHY|5.0|Great movie! Great cinematography! Great editing! Great acting! Great casting!    I loved this movie. From the perspective of a beginning movie maker (amateur), this movie was breathtaking. I loved the camera angles, costumes, props, and the action scenes. This is a really well done movie.    This is also the first movie I watch on my blu-ray player. I watched it on a high definition 42\\" Sony Bravia. The image was amazingly clear and crisp. Try one day to watch a movie with a VHS player, then DVD, then blu-ray. You'll see a big difference from one format to another (I actually have all three players and did this test on the same Sony Bravia).     In this movie you will find comedy, action, gore (lots of blood, but tastefully and comically done), and just pure entertainment. That's what movies are for! The movie is also philosophical, and ends with a touching romantic scene. Just beautiful!    Just as a note for those interested, many actors are fighting high definition. They find HD intruding on their facial inadequacies (for lack of a better word). For example, no actress wants us to see her wrinkles or a zit on her face. With HD, the image is so crisp that many details of a person's face (and body) can be captured by the camera that many actors are embarrassed. The only way to rectify this is by heavy make-up, lenses, or touching the image during editing.
B000GRUS22|5.0|I'd strongly recommend this -  especially in light of the voyageur disappointment - its very different, mostly because Jens Gads signature samples and soundscapes are not so dominant, but its clearly still Enigma -  Sitting on the Moon is a really nice piece of work, followed closely by Dreaming of Andromeda and The Alchemist -  if you're just looking for more stuff like the old Enigma you may be disappointed, but I'm happy to say I think this shows some real growth -  can't wait to see what comes next

0743486285|5.0|Great book - you live the nightmare that was Nikki's life during the heroin days of 80's Motley Crue. If you happened to read \\"The Dirt\\" then this is a must have. The books are similar in style. There are several guest writers that show up to give their version of excerpts from Nikki's crazed herion diaries. Nikki also interprets several of the excerpts so you can better understand where he was coming from today. Simply excellent and brutally honest. Drugs are portrayed as an evil in Nikki's life that it took several attempts to kick.
B00005JPUN|2.0|I did not see the original `Body Snatchers' nor read the book. After seeing this movie, I don't think I would want to. I expected this movie to be scary, suspenseful, and gripping. It wasn't.     I did not like the editing at all. The scenes were cut too fast, moving from one shot to another at a dizzying speed.     I didn't like the beginning of the movie when the Space Shuttle burns on entry and is destroyed. This scene should have been much longer. We should have seen how the alien parasite clung itself to the shuttle. Was it the reason why the shuttle crashed? We should also have seen the crew struggling to fly the Space Shuttle.     Once the Shuttle crashed, the scenes rushed way too fast from identifying the parasite to it infecting people. I just felt the whole movie was rushed.    Seeing Nicole Kidman run away from something at the beginning of the movie just didn't make since. The editor was trying to show us an event in the future to keep us guessing, but this didn't work. The movie should have flowed in a linear manner, not jump from a future event to a present one. This was repeated in several other scenes, and I found this to be very annoying.    The disease is passed by people throwing up. I found this pretty repulsive, especially in the subway scene. Kidman's husband also throws up on her face, yet we see her in the following scene with a clean face and no stains on her shirt--very unbelievable. And what about the stench of the vomit? Kidman then meets up with researchers and eventually with her son--without having taken a bath. Didn't her husband just puke on her? Did no one smell her?    The helicopter scene at the end of the movie was not well done. You could tell it was animation.    Daniel Craig did not do a good job at all. He was more of a supporting actor than a principal one.     At no point throughout this movie did I find myself glued to my seat. There was no suspense; nothing really exciting happening.    The fact that they found a cure soquickly was also unbelievable. We are also not shown the steps taken to find the cure--was way too rushed.  I didn't like the cover design of the DVD either.     The only thing I liked about this movie are the following questions, \\"what would life be like without humans? If a disease turned us into non-violent people, but unproductive, would that be good or bad? Is life better the way it is, with free-will, or one without free-will and without wars? The philosophy behind the movie is great. The movie itself is mediocre.
B0013D8LOK|4.0|I've been a fan of this show since my barber in Hilo, Hawaii in 1980 played some of the score for me. His son was in the cast in the national touring production. I never got to see it on stage, but I owned the Broadway Cast double-LP, and I have the DVD of the stage production originally broadcast on PBS many years ago. The film version did not play my small town in rural New Mexico, so I had to wait for the disc release. I like it a lot, and the rather ordinary singing voices of Depp, Bonham-Carter, Rickman, et al didn't bother me. The condensing of the sweeping operatic score was a necesssity for the film, and since Stephen Sondheim himself was on hand to approve the film venture, the cuts are sensible. I might wish that \\"The Ballad of Sweeney Todd\\" had been sung by the cast over the ending credits, but that's not a fatal omission. Depp and Bonham-Carter and everyone else act the parts with excellence. It is fun to see Rickman and Swall play bad guys outside of their \\"Harry Potter\\" roles, and the boy who plays Toby is the best singer of the bunch. Now for my small criticisms: the movie is just about relentlessly dark, and surely the sun shines in London every once in awhile; the singers sometimes mumble the lyrics, or lose a word due to the British accents, a flaw the stage DVD also has in abundance. The blood...ah, the blood, at the end, is heavy indeed. This truly is a horror film with music. On film, the blood can be so much more vivid and realistic than on stage that a bit less of it might have been enough. I loved the opening credit sequence, however...it seemed to have set the mood perfectly for what follows. Burton and his cast and crew can be proud of this one, but it surely isn't proper for kids under ten or squeamish viewers of either sex. I have always liked Johnny Depp, and here he proves he is up to one of his biggest challenges. Pirate Jack Sparrow is a piker in terms of mayhem compared to Sweeney, and Jack didn't have to sing.
0618918248|1.0|I was very disappointed with this book. Being an Agnostic, I found his Dogmatism expressed in every page. I could not wait to read chapter two which was going to destroy my Agnostic views and bring me into the true and correct Atheistic state of mind. I found his arguments so weak they made no inpression upon me what so ever. I did recognize his anger (really hatred) for Agnostics, he refers to Agnostics as weak and uses the term \\"PAP\\" in refering to Agnostics.    Overall a very poor book, there are better books out there.
B00005QXDD|4.0|tenacious d is the greatest rock band of their genre and this album as a whole is a masterpiece, but after time it loses its appeal and if you take any of the tracks away from the whole they suffer,also not that it matters but because of all the cussing you really cant play anywhere outside the privacy of your own vehicle oe residence but their all minor details,so if you want a good rock band with a ittle comedy and you dont mind foul language than this cd is for you.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I must give credit where credit is due and Jillian Michaels deserves a lot of credit when it comes to this video!  I am a 32 year old mother of two, a full time student and I work part time.  I grew up playing soccer and doing ballet.  I was always very athletic and kept myself in shape.  After 2 c-sections with my kids, my abdomen looks kinda funky and my motivation has been ZERO.  One month ago I weighed the most I have in my entire life - VERY depressing.  I began doing the 30 day shred and let me tell you, I have lost 12 lbs. in the last month and have gone down 2 sizes in clothes!  But the best part about it is that I feel healthier, I have more energy and I am happier.  I have tried a gazillion DVD's (like everyone else) and this workout really does what it is supposed to do - work you out!  It is definitely a total body routine and not for those who are looking for an easy way to working out and  weight loss (and we all know there is no easy way, so you might as well buy this DVD).  It is really a good investment and worth every second of burn(a 12 dollar investment, can't get better than that).
B000IOM1RI|4.0|tenacious d is a great band who expertly mix rock and comedy and this soundtrack from their film and the most of the songs are keepers,bit overall this cd doesn't mesh well and alot of the songs get old after awhile and this just isn't their best. but if you liked the movie or their first cd then i reccomend it completely

0684135051|4.0|This is not a linear learn-to-knit book, & Zimmerman's approach takes a bit of getting used to, but it provides useful information to both the novice & the experienced knitter.  It was helpful to me, & I've been knitting for 40 years. I plan to use it to teach a friend to knit.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|At first I didn't like this movie and I thought it was stupid. For some reason it grew on me. Now I can't stop laughing everytime I watch it. This is one of those movies that you think is going to be a bomb but then laugh so much from the weirdness. There are laughs all over the place and it takes a good half hour for Shaun (Simon Pegg) to realize that he is surrounded by zombies. Him and a friend that he lives with cook up a plan to save his ex-girlfriend, his mom, and stepfather (although Shaun would rather leave him to the zombies). Shaun believes the best place to wait it out is at the local pub.<br /><br />There weapons of choice are: cricket paddles, old records (Shaun goes through which ones to through which is hilarious), his stepfather's Jaguar, and a metal pipe.<br /><br />Shaun of the Dead is very entertaining and is one of those movies that you'd think you would skip if it's in the movie theaters and on T.V. When you watch it, you get hooked. The comedy is great as it mocks Dawn of the Dead slightly and any other zombie movie you've watched. It's a good addition to your comedy collection.
0810994739|5.0|My 9yr old son, has not found much that he likes to read, until he found these two books.  He read them both in 24 hours, as he could not put them down.  Now, he just wishes the author would hurry and write more.
B0000DD79B|4.0|This collection contains more than 35 songs which include just about all of the best known ones and quite a few lesser known but good ones, like el Condor Pasa.  Most of them are the studio recordings, especially the better known ones like Sounds of Silence, and they sound very good.  I think overall it is very good, especially for the price.<br /><br />A few minor areas of concern:  First, there are some live tracks which sound better in their studio versions.  I am not sure why they include live cuts when the studio ones are certainly available.  Second, the packaging is cheap - I had to break the case to get at CD Number 2.  I had this problem with another of the \\"Essential\\" sets, so I think they could do a better job here.  Finally, I am not sure why they included a few songs; for example, I find \\"Old Friends\\" and \\"A Most Peculiar Man\\" depressing.  Overall, howerer, I think this a very good collection and is certainly worth the money!
B0013FBS20|4.0|To begin with, video quality is excellent, and for $19 the blu-ray version is a great deal.  If you liked the movie in theaters, you won't be disappointed.  The best part is the alternate ending version, which really only affects Chapters 25-28.  In my opinion, the alternate ending provided for a much more \\"complete\\" movie, and touches on issues and themes only hinted at in the theatrical release.  Without giving too much away, I have to say that despite what Hollywood execs think, you owe it to yourself if you're a true sci-fi fan to watch the alternate ending.  For me, it's the more hopeful one of the two, and serves as a wonderful springboard for philosophical discussion.  Enjoy.
B000PTYUQG|5.0|I consider this release\compilation to be the greatest classical bargain of 2007-a year of many complete issues such as Bach and Mozart on Brilliant classics(before 07).<br />Stravinsky is the conductor for almost all the performances with the CBS orchestra and, though recorded in the early to late 60's, the sound is spectacular. I am listening to disc 1(for the tenth time) and still love the ambience of old tape recordings(which I find far superior to much of today's DDD and DSD. I will take warmth, substance, and presence over clinical precision and unrealistic detail any day of the week.<br />Much of the works here are the performances of said works. Of course the rite of spring has been reproduced about as many times as the bible, so it is difficult to say this is the finest, but it is one of the best and with Stravinsky at the helm takes on an air of authority.<br />I must say I have never enjoyed a Firebird as much as this complete version on disc one.<br />Again the sound is absolutely incredible. I am listening on a Harman\Kardon surround set and it is spectularly detailed, yet full and believeable, like a real concert hall.<br />Bravo for this generous release and anyone, both new and familiar with Stravinsky need not think twice about purchasing this. Especially if you are new and would like to get the majority of his great works at one throw for the price of two new releases.<br />Bravo!!!!!!!!
B00000K19E|5.0|The Good Things<br />*Fantastic, ground-breaking special effects and stylish action.<br />*Intruiging premise, with a storyline that keeps you hooked.<br />*Good cast of characters; great acting.<br />*Even though certain influences are obvious, it doesn't necessarily rip-off anything.  It's very original in its own right.<br />*The writing is excellent.  Not only is it easy to comprehend, but also has a lot of complex themes concerning philosophy, sociology, and mythology (and perhaps theology, although that is more apparent in the sequels).  Each new viewing reveals something new to think about.<br />*Filming style is excellent, even when the camera is not doing a 360-degree turn.  It's fresh, original, and has many strong motifs.  The use of colors is excellent as well.<br />*Now that I've seen it five times, I can see strong continuity with the sequels.<br />*Awesome music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*A little slow for the first half.  All of the fighting is more in the end.<br />*Those who do not like action movies may find this stupid.<br /><br />I still consider this to be an absolute favorite.  Aside from mind-bending action and effects, the story is swell and has lots of awesome, memorable characters.  Themes and motifs are strong, and with each new viewing, something new can be discovered.  It is even stronger now that the sequels are out, and one can see how all three films work together as a whole.  It is constantly refreshing and exciting to watch this, for it is probably the most intelligent action movie ever made.  If all action movies were made this way, perhaps Hollywood could redeem itself! I expect that this will become a cinematic classic; everybody should see it at least once in their life.
0307265730|4.0|The Enigma of Arrival's Evanescence    By    Rajesh C. Oza, India Currents      It is altogether possible that some twenty years ago, Jhumpa Lahiri, not quite twenty herself, might have read V. S. Naipaul's \\"The Enigma of Arrival,\\" an autobiography published as a novel.  Lahiri's new collection, \\"Unaccustomed Earth,\\" is fiction that reads like autobiography.  Both writers use powerfully quiet, unadorned language to create vividly imagined illusions of their reality.  Naipaul's reality is expressed through characters who are on the enigmatic edge of arrival - a metaphor for postcolonialism.  Lahiri's characters reflect a different reality - they have successfully put their mark on the new world only to recognize that their arrival is short-lived.    The title of Naipaul's book is borrowed from a Giorgio de Chirico painting of a wharf in which two faceless figures have seemingly disembarked from a schooner; so much of Naipaul's writing explores the exterior landscape of people living on distant shores.  After writing about the familial immigrant experience of his native Trinidad, the Nobel Prize winner worked primarily across a broad canvas of large, political themes.      In one of Lahiri's short stories, a character admires van Eyck's \\"The Arnolfini Marriage,\\" a painting of a bedroom in which a husband and wife are formally and exquisitely rendered; Lahiri's world is more confined than Naipaul's, focusing on the interior landscape of personal relationships.  The Pulitzer Prize winner is a miniaturist with an eye for the highly educated children of Indian-American immigrants, living the professional's life of upscale consumerism and downtown angst.  Like van Eyck's art, Lahiri's writing is architected with deftly placed furnishings, clothing, and accessories.  Whereas Naipaul's characters are those anonymous individuals to be found in front-page photographs of wars and uprisings, Lahiri's characters reside in the New York Times' \\"SundayStyles\\" section, prominently celebrating Ivy League couplings and a few years later bemoaning their \\"Modern Love\\" breakups.    Comparing and contrasting Naipaul and Lahiri is helpful because both share a brilliant understated style, but each plows different fields.  After three books, it is becoming clear that Lahiri has found her own \\"unaccustomed earth.\\"  With the prize-winning \\"Interpreter of Maladies,\\" Lahiri arrived in a spectacularly precocious way.  \\"The Namesake\\" (and Mira Nair's adaptation of the novel to film) dispelled doubts that the young author might be a one-time wonder.  The happy news is that the freshman phenom not only hurdled her sophomore slump, but has also avoided a junior jinx.  In Unaccustomed Earth, Lahiri's preternaturally mature voice has grown even more confident.  The title short story is the strongest of the five fine pieces that constitute the first half of the book.  Sensitively portraying the independent lives of a daughter and father, \\"Unaccustomed Earth\\" is the only story in the collection that is not predominantly located in America's Northeast.  While Seattle is a stock location serving to suggest the double displacement from India and the East Coast, Ruma and her father are authentic characters that the reader cares for.  They have been twice removed from each other:  first by the death of their mother/wife; and then by the geographic relocation of the daughter and her non-Indian husband and son, and the European travel by the father and his sudden love interest.  Lahiri's sharp and sympathetic observations are deeply considered, using memory, dialogue, and visual detail to capture the family dynamics:  there are the nearly forgotten epic trips to India, the daughter pained by her father's criticism, the father in his baseball cap resembling an American in old age.  And there is the diasporic's lament of India fading away, as immigrants and their children make life in a new part of the earth:  Ruma \\"had remembered the many times her mother had predicted thisvery moment, lamenting the fact that her daughter preferred pants and skirts to the clothing she wore, that there would be no one to whom to pass on her things.\\"    All the short stories are masterful in their use of metaphor.  In \\"Unaccustomed Earth,\\" there is an unkempt garden tended by Ruma's visiting father; in this natural nursery, a gentle, evanescent intimacy develops with the light-skinned grandson, who becomes brown for a moment, \\"his golden legs covered with dirt.\\"  Similarly, there are recurring images in \\"Hell-Heaven,\\" \\"A Choice of Accommodations,\\" \\"Only Goodness,\\" and \\"Nobody's Business\\" which bring pleasure to the reader: a teacup is introduced as an innocuous replacement for an ashtray, only to be revisited later as a symbol for shattered romance; a safety pin becomes a frightening symbol of an attempted suicide; and, less successfully, a secret six-pack suggests rebellious, teenage alcoholic ennui.  In her cautionary tales about precarious love, Lahiri writes about a highly educated class that transcends ethnicity.  Ruma of Colgate and Northeastern Law, Pranab of MIT, Amit of Columbia, Sudha of Penn, Rahul of Cornell, Sang(eeta) of Harvard do resemble Barnard-educated Lahiri, with her multiple graduate school degrees.   And to some extent their loves - Adam, Deb, Megan, Roger, Elena, and Farouk/Freddy - do resemble, at least in European name, Lahiri's husband, Alberto.  Perhaps because of the surface similarities of these characters, there is a tiring redundancy masked by Lahiri's exceptional competence.  By the time I reached the fourth story, I felt the weariness that non-Indians (and perhaps, Indians themselves) must feel when hearing for the umpteenth time about the academic and professional accomplishments of Indian-American children.    The second part of this collection is a novella that begins promisingly.  The opening two chapters of \\"Hema and Kaushik\\" are finely crafted first-person narratives introducing the intersecting lives of the title characters.       Lahiri captures the bittersweet tone of Hema's puppy love feelings for Kaushik.  Kaushik is three years older than Hema when he and his parents return to America from India and stay for a short period with Hema's family.  Thirteen year-old Hema, who has had to relinquish her bedroom to make room for the visiting family friends, conveys her infatuation by way of an imagined conversation with Kaushik:  \\"You had successfully wiped away all the other crushes I harbored at school, so that I thought only of being at home, and of where in the course of the afternoon and evening our paths might intersect, whether or not you would bother to glance at me at the dinner table.\\"      Kaushik, older and more experienced, is indifferent to Hema's feelings.  He is isolated by family tragedy and by the temperament of one who likes to travel alone.  It is not until five years later, when he has almost graduated from college, that he thinks of Hema:  \\"I had hated every day I spent under your parents' roof, but now I thought back to that time with nostalgia.  Though we didn't belong there, it was the last place that had felt like a home.\\"  Interlaced between Hema and Kaushik's story are touching asides about parents and their children and about adult friendships that slowly grow apart.  Towards the end of these two chapters, there is a powerful scene where Kaushik must come to terms with his maltreatment of stepsisters who have recently arrived from India.  He recalls that \\"tears fell down their faces but words continued to pour out of me, words that should not have been uttered, should not have been heard.\\"  In shame and anger, he flees from the house and travels across a New England landscape that is psychologically far removed from the cloistered life of immigrant families.    The final chapter of  \\"Hema and Kaushik\\" ends somewhat unevenly.  Unlike a triptych that is integrated, the third story seems to have been hastily cobbled on.  An omniscient narrator fast-forwards twenty years to a quaint part of Italy; and as in a Bollywood movie after intermission, there is a convenient reunion of the childhood acquaintances.  Unfortunately, the contract with the reader is broken and the lovely tenderness of the first two chapters is forgotten.    However uneven the contents, the title of this book will not be soon forgotten.  Inspired by a passage from Nathaniel Hawthorne's \\"The Custom House\\" (preface to \\"The Scarlet Letter\\"), Jhumpa Lahiri has reincarnated from her fellow New Englander a phrase which is startlingly original:    \\"Human nature will not flourish, any more than a potato, if it be planted and replanted, for too long a series of generations, in the same worn-out soil.  My children have had other birthplaces, and, so far as their fortunes may be within my control, shall strike their roots into unaccustomed earth.\\"
B000BYA5GO|4.0|The Good Things<br />*Complex, all-encompassing story that's thrilling and interesting throughout.<br />*Very strong, thought-provoking themes (especially concerning the moral implications of gun trafficking, the corruptive nature of crime, world governments' role in worldwide violence, and many other eye-opening topics).<br />*Lots of memorable scenes and imagery that reinforce the various themes.  Good filming style.<br />*Excellent characters.  Nicholas Cage provides both witty humor and bleak moral commentary.<br />*Some parts are exceptionally detailed and realistic; it is clear that the filmmakers did their research.  Good writing.<br />*Good sound and music design.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Some themes really are convoluted, especially regarding the main character.  Even though he looses everything, he never really suffers any legal punishment and never learns from his mistakes, and continues to smuggle guns.<br />*Not sure if the film is really politically or socially accurate.<br /><br />I could summarize this as \\"Scarface\\" with guns instead of drugs, but such a comparison is really too simple.  Although Yuri (Nicholas Cage) has many of the same traits as Tonny Montanna, he is a very different character, full of wit and wisdom that contrasts with his lack of morality.  This film also differentiates itself with vivid settings (both physical and political), a strong filming style, and some very revealing themes.  This film portrays many of the problems in developing countries, and explores the issues surrounding them.  By the end of it, it leaves you bleakly pondering about the world's situation.  I would definately reccomend to everybody to at least rent this movie.
B00003CWNR|4.0|Homer Wells (Maguire) was born and raised in a New England orphanage under the care and tutelage of Dr. Wilber Larch (Caine), who came to the orphanage to be a hero.     Homer was considered one of the 'unadoptables'.  The first couple who took him was disapointed because he didn't cry (orphan babies don't cry).  The second couple made Homer cry by abusing him.     Homer became Dr. Larch's apprentice, tending the sick children, delivering women of babies they're surrendering, but Homer drew the line at aborting babies. It was against the law.     Larch advises Homer when he leaves that he will find harsher conditions out in the world, but will be unable to do as much as the orphanage could.    When a young couple Wally and Candy (Rudd and Theron) come to get an abortion, Homer leaves with them.  While Wally is off to fly in World War II, Homer works in Wally's family orchard, picking apples.      There he learns about the Cider House Rules.  There's a whole wall of them posted on the migrant workers' bunkhouse.  Only thing is, Wally is the only one who can read them.  The rest of the itinerant laborers cannot read. He learns just how germane those rules are to the people who have to live out in the world.    The movie is nowhere as strong as John Irving's book upon which it was based.  Scenery and score are lovely.  The highlight, for me, was Michael Caine's acting as Larch, which won him an Oscar. It's a harsh film, but a real and beautiful one.
B0013K6WLM|4.0|The album is a little bit different, it's polished but not in a way that takes away the fuzzy blues-rock that The Black Keys are known for.    When I first heard that Danger Mouse would be helping with the album, I wasn't so sure, but it turns out that he really didn't mess up what the band is all about like I thought he might.  Some of the back beats are definitely not what I was used to hearing from them, but they don't really negatively influence any of the songs, in my opinion.    Their single, \\"Strange Times\\" is extremely catchy despite the fact that at the end I thought I was listening to an early 90's Snoop Dogg remix.    This album is not as good as their previous efforts, but it's not bad by any means.  It's very good, but it's going to be a little bit difficult to adjust to if you buy the album thinking it's going to be the same thing as Thickfreakness or The Big Come Up.      They've moved in a different direction as musicians for this album, but not in the wrong direction.  The album will surely grow on me and I already like it as it is.      Solid 4 stars.
0684853523|5.0|It is true that the first fifth of this book is Stephen King's rambling, self-indulgent monologue about what a tough life he had as a youth.  It is also true that King:<br /><br />*  Uses this book as a vehicle to wreak literary revenge on the man who nearly killed him because he was too busy watching his Rottweiler to watch where he was driving his van--he also does this in one of the last books of his Dark Tower series.<br /><br />* Tells readers that because of the pompous nature of the literary critics, the full talent of popular authors such as he (King) is never recognized until they are dead.  Here he groups himself with Raymond Chandler.<br /><br />* Tells the world what a hard knocks life he had as a youth.<br /><br />* Launches snide attacks on other authors--Danielle Steel and John Katzenbach at the top of the list.<br /><br />* Uses the book as a confessional about his drug and drinking problems he experienced along with his success.<br /><br />and<br /><br />* Indulges in endless self-promotion.<br /><br />It is also true that Mr. King at one point tells his readers that he does not believe in the profanity but that in order to portray his characters honestly, he must insert profanity into their thoughts and dialog.  An interesting premise to be sure, but it does not explain why King places so much of the profanity he disdains throughout the narrative of his book on writing.  Face it, the man likes to swear.<br /><br />I could come up with a dozen more things to gripe about, but the truth is that Mr. King's book on writing is the finest book of its kind that I have read.  (And I have read these books by the dozen.)<br /><br />A number of those people who gave On Writing bad reviews simply did not read far enough.  I know.  The first time I read this book, I got only as far as King's \\"impossibly Abraham Lincoln\\" early married life, the part in which he lived in poverty, taught high school during the day, and sat on his porch with his typewriter poised on his lap at night.  I got that far and I quit reading.  And here is my true confession, I went to Amazon and gave this book a one-star review which I later removed.<br /><br />I removed that review because a close friend of mine all but forced me to finish reading the book.  No more than 20 pages after the spot where I gave up, King suddenly shifts gears and spends next half of his book giving the most sound and practical advice I have ever seen in a book for young writers.  (The book returns to a self-indulgent memoir about the day he was struck by a van and his hard-fought recovery.  The word \\"Memoir\\" is included in the title, what should you expect?)<br /><br />He discusses everything from the way you should set up your office to the schedule by which you should write.  Unlike the literary advice you get from creative writing professors, King is practical.  He is a business man.  Yes, he is a successful businessman and he wants you to know it.  Early on he says, \\"anybody who has sold as many books as I have...\\" This is his writer's bible, he gets to put what he wants in it.<br /><br />But Stephen King has a lot of important stuff to say.  While his message is wrapped in self-indulgence and profanity, it is the singular message of someone who worked hard and succeeded.  For those writers who never aspired to be the next Hemingway, Shakespeare, or Faulkner, this is your book.<br /><br />Not every writer wants to be the next Salman Rushdie or even the next Norman Mailer.  King recognizes that there are people who aspire to be John Grisham, Tom Clancy, J. K. Rowling, and Stephen King.  I don't know about you, but I get envious when I hear that Dan Brown sold 60 million copies of The Da Vinci Code--many of those in hardback.  There are writers who do not want to leave a literary legacy, they just want to write what they like and make a living.<br /><br />That is one of the things that stand out about On Writing, it is a book for people who want to make a living writing books.  This book will likely offend people who believe that writing should be an art and that there is no room in writing for calculating low lives who want to sell stories instead of literary works.<br /><br />I gave you a list of the major things King did wrong in this book; now let me list just a few of the things he does right.  He:<br /><br />* Helps young writers set up a writing schedule.<br /><br />* Gives insights into dialog.<br /><br />* Shows the difference between plot and story.<br /><br />* Offers wonderful insights into editing your work.<br /><br />* Explains the importance of balancing description and reader imagination.<br /><br />* Encourages writers to trust their instincts.<br /><br />* Gives a needed summary of the basics of correct English.<br /><br />* Illustrates his points with insights from his experiences as one of the most successful writers of all-time.<br /><br />Yes, I am aware that this book has flaws in the beginning and in the end, and I still give it five stars.  If I had the option, I would give it a sixth star.  If you wade through Stephen King's need to indulge himself, skip the beginning... better yet, read it and get over it.  He's a great storyteller; and even when he trots out the violins and bemoans his hard life, he is entertaining.  And once you get beyond the autobiography, you really will find that King's insights are helpful.writing for calculating low lives who want to sell stories instead of literary works.

B00127RAJY|5.0|Ok, if you're like me (overweight and unmotivated) and watch The Biggest Loser and wish you could be one of the contestants and have Jillian train you then you're in luck!  Buy this DVD!  I just received the dvd today and did the First Level today.  It's been 2 and 1/2 hours since I finished and I'm still shaking and finding it hard to go up and down stairs.  I can't even imagine what she puts those poor contestants through..LOL!    I have knee pains and feet pains and usually just walk at 3mph on my treadmill.  Well, suffice to say I'm not seeing any weight loss.  And let me be honest the real reason I have knee and feet problems is because I weigh too much.  So I did the full on jumping jacks..no modified jumping jacks in this workout...Jillian tells you straight, she has 400lb people doing full jumping jacks, you can too!  And she was right.  I sure as heck can't really do the push ups but I'm sure that I will be able to eventually if I keep doing this dvd everyday for 20 minutes.    And she's right, you can't do a workout for 20 minutes and expect it to be easy...you want easy, don't get this dvd.  You want to sweat and really workout get this dvd!    I'm 5'4'' and 168 lbs.  I will let you know my progress in my comments as time goes on.  Good luck to everyone!
0374105235|4.0|A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier  By: Ishmael Beah    The book a long way gone is a historical non-fiction book. It is about the author's childhood and his struggle to survive. Ishmael was born in Sierra Leone, a country in West Africa, in 1980. A Long Way Gone is a truly heart wrenching story of a boy who has seen so much hatred and cruelty in his lifetime that it seems unreal. Ishmael Beah lost his family to the war, so he fights along side the countries army against the rebels, those who have been killing civilians and burning villages to the ground.  This book is astonishing, thought provoking, disgustingly true, useful, and overall extraordinary.   After Ishmael had been forced to join the army his lieutenant told him these words in a successful attempt to motivate the troops: \\"the lieutenant went on for almost an hour, describing how rebels had cut off the heads of some people's family members and made them watch. Burned entire villages along with their inhabitants, forced sons to have intercourse with their mothers, hacked newly born babies in half because they cried too much, cut open pregnant women's stomachs, took the babies out, and killed them...  \\"They have lost everything that makes them human. They do not deserve to live. That is why we must kill every single one of them.\\" \\" (Beah pg. 108) As I read this quote the first time I had to stop half way through because I felt as if I was going to throw up. It didn't even seem true as I read it. This quote is just a taste of how disgusting and iniquitous this book is.   At the age of twelve Ishmael ran away from his village and by thirteen was forced to fight for the government army. Before this time he was friendly. The war had made him do horrible things that just seemed second nature after a while as expressed in this quote: \\"The idea of death didn't cross my mind at all and killing had become as easy as drinking water.\\" (Beah pg. 122) It is disgusting how if you do something enough, even something as terrible as killing, it becomes normal to you. After fighting in the army so long and at a vulnerable age Ishmael started acting differently also. \\" The prisoner was simply another rebel who was responsible for the death of my family, as I had come to truly believe. The corporal gave the signal with a pistol shot and I grabbed the man's head and slit his throat in one fluid motion.... His eyes rolled u and they looked me straight in the eye before they suddenly stopped in a frightful glance, as if caught by surprise.... I was proclaimed the winner...\\" (Beah pg. 125) Killing people had now become a competition or a game for the boys of the army.   This book is not only entertaining but it teaches valuable lessons such as: \\"If you are alive there is hope for a better day and something good to happen. If there is nothing good left in the destiny of a person, he or she will die.\\" (Beah pg. 54) This is a good lesson to be learned and an interesting opinion on life.  The lesson being that is you are still alive there is a reason and you must continue on and persevere because there is something worthwhile in your future.   I recommend this book to anyone who is naive or just interested in what is going on currently in Africa and how it impacts the children. This book is also a good book for people that want to learn a little bit about writing an interesting story and how to incorporate dialogue seamlessly because Ishmael Beah is able to do it very well. After or even before this book, if you would like any background information on the topic of child soldiers you should visit the Invisible Children website at [...]
B000000W71|5.0|Although I am not a big fan of Gary Moore, I own 6 of his albums in my collection.<br />My personal opinion, none of his albums is consistent beginning to end.<br />This album, compiled from his previous releases includes his best soft Rock songs; great singing, great guitar; if I have to own 1 album for Gary Moore. This is definitely the one.
B0013BNY2Q|3.0|It seems the best reviews for this album are coming from fans who love REM's 80s stuff.  I prefer their 90s stuff so I'm mixed on \\"Accelerate\\".  Even so, I think it's fair to say that there's a little something here for everyone.  I could do without the political preaching though.
B000R3QZ2C|5.0|I would be surprised if there is another orchestra on earth this versatile, and capable of playing with such \\"oneness\\".  An unparalleled dynamic range, perfect intonation, and historically informed phrasing are all featured here. The Berlin Philharmonic is the world's top orchestra, and this disk is representative of their consistently high level; this is a live recording.    Highly recommended if you are looking to hear the best doing what they do best.
B0010V4TZU|2.0|I listen to too much contemporary music for my own good. Music generally evolves and mutates out of its immediate surroundings (Neutral Milk Hotel aside) and therefore it can be understood in a context of its own society.<br /><br />Maybe it's the hype machine. Maybe it's the sweaters not being emo enough. Maybe it's the prep garage rock aesthetic. But nothing in this record neither inspires me nor feels close to what I want to listen to, nor can I understand it. All the terms applied with the music, such as \\"yacht rock,\\" \\"cape cod,\\" \\"university brats,\\" and \\"African\\" (whatever that means ) somehow exist as accurate assessments of the music and the culture. The songs are neither inspiring nor are accurate reflections of the generation, except that one small subculture in which they exist. I don't want to get into a note to note understanding of the music (that would inspire to much ranting), or even a song understanding. Singles such as \\"A-Punk\\" sound like a failed ska song, \\"Mansford Roof\\" best part is simply the sound of the keyboard. There's not a lot to this music (and there is no intention of there being a lot), so the more you dig, the more you will find references to the small world they exist in. I appreciate the calm and \\"cute\\" areas of indie pop, I really do. But in between baroque pop, Afro pop, and prep pop, it's hard for Vampire Weekend to even get the pop part of the music right.<br /><br />When our children look through our ipods and listen to \\"Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa,\\" Vampire Weekend better hope it has the posterity of Rick Astley or Hall and Oates. If they can even barely reach that level of infamy, then the more power to them. I simply give two stars hoping that someday they'll put down their gimmicks and write three songs in a row that don't force me to hyperventilate.
0143058525|5.0|This is a fun book that takes you on a journey.  The author is well written and has a wonderful story to tell.  I recommend it to young and old.
0689865384|4.0|I liked UGLIES quite a bit.  It's like Brave New World, a book about the hidden dark side of utopia, but written in shades of gray instead of Huxley's black and white.  In Westerfield's world, social control and brainwashing leave citizens with enough independence that the benefits just might be worth the costs.  Life is pretty good - everybody is provided with all the material goods they may need, surgically crafted physical beauty suited to their age and station, the freedom to indulge in youthful tricks and, later, adult pleasures.<br /><br />Almost everybody is happy - and, tell the truth, who wouldn't willingly trade a few brain cells for a lifetime of happiness?  I sure would.  But the few people who prefer a hard life with their own looks and their own thoughts to brain-damaged, supermodel paradise escape to found a city of their own, called The Smoke.  Unfortunately, the kind of people who are drawn to The Smoke are exactly the individuals that the City can't afford to lose - the smartest, the bravest, the toughest.  That's not ok, and the city will do anything to get the escapees back and integrate them into the system.<br /><br />Tally Youngblood is smart and brave, but she's also fifteen years old.  She's easy to identify with, but she makes some horrible choices, all of them born out of the desire to fit in that motivates most teenagers most of the time.  She's a kid, and you can see her learning from her mistakes and trying to do better, but she's been forced into a dangerous game and the stakes are very high.<br /><br />The plot's been summarized elsewhere, so I won't repeat it here.  I liked the fact that the bells and whistles of Westerfield's future served the story, rather than becoming the subject of the book.  I liked the fact that Westerfield is playing with a lot of really big ideas, but never becomes heavy-handed with them.  I liked the fact that Westerfield doesn't coddle his characters.  And I really liked Westerfield's writing, which is utterly brilliant.
0452289963|5.0|Everyone needs to read this book.  It should be required reading in some high school classes and college classes.  The man is brilliant.  And humble.
B001041JKU|2.0|The original album conisting of the first 10 tracks still contain the great writing and production values of the past.  Nonetheless, the remixes from songs 11 - 16 are not worthy of being included in such a great, historical project.  I enjoyed the DVD with the music videos. It was particulary impressive because I was backstage and observed the Motown 25 Year Celebration and was standing close to Michael prior to his performance. Other than than, there is little else that advances the greatness of this historical album.  I will still listen to the first ten titles and skip the balance of the album.  Michael - what's up with this???????
0385338724|5.0|Anyone who has read a novel by Sophie Kinsella knows that she excels at creating main characters that are hilariously flawed and lovable, who manage to get themselves into numerous funny predicaments. \\"Remember Me?\\" is no exception, and is thoroughly enjoyable, with an intriguing plot. Though the ending is fairly predictable, the question of how exactly did the main character, Lexi Smart, become the person she was will keep you reading until the end. I didn't find this book to be as funny as some of Kinsella's others, however, the sheer charmingness of the main and supporting characters of this novel make it my favorite of her works.    Grade: A
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|Just a reminder to never forget how great AND influencial REM actually is... So the last few records have been a little subpar, few bands almost 30 years into their career can make a record as vital as Accelerate,  even if they are trying or not... of course it isn't as good as the I.R.S. years, or early Warners period, it can't be and it's not supposed to be, not the same band, not the same time..., it is a great R.E.M. record though, and though it falls a little short of the glory of past works, it's miles above the imitators and followers for whom R.E.M. is a cornerstone, lets not forget who we are talking about here, a little credit is due...
B000001FYZ|2.0|Crazy World is about on the same level as Savage Amusement for me. It's a good CD for Scorpion fans, but to a widespread general audience it's probably just the album that contains the hit Wind Of Change. Never able to recapture the brilliance of Love At First Sting, this one continues the Scorps' downward slide from the top of their game. I like this CD enough to keep it as a part of my collection because I really like the band, but after the first few tracks I usually get bored and listen to something else. My favorite tracks include: Tease me Please Me, To Be With You in Heaven, Wind of Change, Kicks After Six.
B0000025D0|5.0|Bruce Springsteen-Darkness On The Edge Of Town<br /><br />Dealing with subjects like betrayal, broken promises, Darkness On The Edge Of Town plays out like the continuation of this albums predisessor Born To Run except only twice as dark and Melancholy, and yet twice as hopeful at the same time.<br /><br />Songs like 'Factory', and 'Adam Raised A Cain' feature excellent hard rock that Springsteen would never touch so wonderfully again, but they are rockers because they have such heavy and saddend subjuect matter. Songs like 'Candy's Room' seem to show the other side of the spectrum without losing this sides evil undertones.<br /><br />Darkness On The Edge Of Town is THE Bruce Springsteen album. Not even the great Born To Run can contend with the lyrical genius of Darkness, and the instrumentation is superb. If only one Springsteen album is bought this is the one, though I guarantee afterwards you'll want more
B000001FN9|2.0|If you're a big fan of the Scorpions like I am, you'll probably enjoy Savage Amusement. It is not, however, on the same high level as their outstanding peak albums Blackout and Love At First Sting. For the casual listener who wants something beyond a \\"greatest hits\\" compilation studio album, I recommend those two releases. If you're a Scorpshead who wants more Matthias, Klaus and Rudy, Savage Amusement fits the bill. My favorite tracks include Rhythm of Love and When Passion Rules the Game.

B000002GAF|5.0|This is the album that made Gino Vannelli a commercial superstar.However that meant some musical consessions had to be made. On this recording Gino pulled back heavy on the ARP synthesizer orchestraion that had characterized his previous albums [[ASIN:B000002G9M The Gist of the Gemini]] and [[ASIN:B000002GG8 A Pauper in Paradise]] and concentrated on live instrumentation. The jazzy R&B strains in his work are played up more then even before;the funky \\"Appaloosa\\",\\"The River Must Flow\\" and \\"Love And Emotion\\" certainly accomplish this well. This album also contains \\"I Just Want To Stop\\",the pop ballad that became Gino's signature song and is the song most people currently associate with him. But the fusion leanings of the poignant declarations of familial love on the title track and \\"People I Belong To\\" show not only that Gino hadn't lost his golden artistic touch but that he cared a great deal about his family and the people who helped him become successful-as always he seems to have a huge heart when it comes to lyrics,but never looses his cool doing it. True on \\"Feel Like Flying\\" and the cryptic \\"The Evil Eye\\" there are definate hints of the \\"old\\" Gino where he tended to value artistic vision over commercial success. All that being true the fact that this album says a lot more about Gino the songcrafter and tunesmith then it does Gino the virtuoso it did have the effect of getting more people interested in his music.If you don't have any Gino in your collection and already own recordings by people like Steely Dan,Jan Hammer or even Edgar Winter (all often unsung artistic innovators in a similar genre as well) this is something you cannot do wrong with!
0452289963|5.0|This is not a \\"fun\\" book or a book about getting new interesting ideas. It's a book about trancending the need to think our way through life and about living in an entirely new way.<br /><br />The \\"new earth \\" that Eckart Tolle is describing is an earth where we can live without being domintated by long standing ego domiated patterns. Eckart gently takes us, chapter by chapter, out of our heavy patterns of living into a new way of seeing.<br /><br />He shows us our often over looked mechanical ways of living in the world and by giving them an honest look, helps us to drop them forever(or at the very least, loosen their hold over us). This is not a book to think about, it's a book to read and recognize the patterns that have been holding us back from seeing our true nature.<br /><br />Eckart Tolle is not just another writer with great new ideas, he's an awe inspiring spiritual master that can really have a life-changing impact on each of us, if we can honestly look at ourselves as we read this amazing book. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is ready to step beyond their cozy notions about themselves.
B000JMK8R4|3.0|As a pro trader who read a lot of books on creativity, self improvement and contrarian thinking/trading, I found the author's ideas familiar, but not his interesting presentation through extensive and interesting use of graphs, pictures and page designs. I dare not recommend it to any serious self help book reader or creative professional. Nevertheless, it's a good choice for a 30 minute leisure reading. On the other hand, I read this right after the author's another book \\"It's not how good you are. It's...\\". The two books are very similar and so I had written two nearly identical reviews for each. Pardon me!<br /><br />p.s. Below please find some of my favorite passages for your reference.<br /><br />Salomon Brothers met with prospective clients not once a month or once a day, but three times a day. That is unreasonable. But it works. Most people are reasonable, that's why they only do reasonably well.pg 42<br /><br />A young man worked as a runner in an advertising firm. One day he said to his manager, \\"I'm leaving. I'm going to be a drummer.\\" The manager said, \\"I didnt know you played the drums.\\" He replied, \\"I dont, but I'm going to.\\" A few years later that young man played in a band with Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce...He became what he wanted to become before he knew he could do it.

0440237688|5.0|I think it must be more difficult to write Children's fiction than Adult Fiction, and more difficult still to write a Children's story that adults like and can relate to.  Lois Lowry has this gift.  The story is very compelling and thought provoking.<br /><br />It is ultimately about the lack of freedom of choice and its consequences.  Everything in The Community is controlled and you have absolute rules to live by in order to keep the community peaceful and happy.  Only one person in the community knows the truth and sacrifices made to be able to live without strife....he is The Receiver of Memories.  He holds the memories of what was the past.  He holds pain, sorrow, loss, love, joy, torture, war, climate: He holds it all so the community doesn't have to.  Jonas is chosen to be the new Receiver of Memories when he becomes a 12.  The old R of M becomes The Giver as Jonas becomes the new R of M.  Through The Giver, Jonas begins to understand what is behind the facade of his community, thereby forever separating himself from it because he can never go back to the way it was, not with his knowing.  Then he is faced with a life or death choice.  What he chooses is brave and mature.<br /><br />I absolutely will read more of Lois Lowry.  She does not disappoint.  I recommend Gossamer, a very heartfelt and engaging story.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This show is such sick fun! Dexter Morgan is a loveable anti-hero, an intellectual serial killer who channels his murderous urges by strictly targeting heinous criminals who have escaped justice and are sure to offend again. His narration to the viewer is priceless, and the greatest comic irony about the show is that Dexter works as a forensic blood analyst for the Miami PD...where he can troll for his next victims. Be honest, who among us hasn't secretly desired to play \\"The Punisher\\" when we hear about the Jeffrey Dahmers and the Charles Mansons of the world who lawyer up and flout the justice system for years on end?   In addition to brilliant plotting and interesting, often hilarious  characters, the show also has intriguing, more serious and dramatic sub-plots that make you want to come back for more. The most original and fascinating show in years!
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Stagate - Ark of the Truth was a fine continuation of where it left of from the original TV series.  I like the DVD two hour versions better than the original TV series as I have a copy that I can see over again and gives more in entertainment than the TV series.
B000PFUA9G|5.0|Who says country has to be all sad-sack sappy about gettin' drunk and losing your woman, dog, truck, job, etc? Brad Paisley, like Garth Brooks did, makes country fun again. Paisley is witty, funny and contemporary, and speaks to those of us who are sick and tired of cryin' in our beer with  Toby Keith. I dare you to listen to \\"Ticks\\" and not chuckle out loud. This album is a real treat.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I don't have Showtime, so I never caught this show on TV. I have HBO and truly enjoyed [[ASIN:B000HEVZBW Six Feet Under]]. With that series ended, I wanted to watch more from the actors I fell in love with. Hence leading me to Michael C. Hall's performance on Dexter.<br /><br />The premise of the show is quite interesting. And I bought the series along with the books written by [[ASIN:0307277887 Jeff Lindsey]], knowing NOTHING about the series or the show. It was a risk I'm glad I took.<br /><br />I started watching the episodes and couldn't stop. Didn't have time to read the books. Just fell in love with the characters. And as hard as it was to disconnect Hall's role on SFU, Dexter slowly stood on his own.<br /><br />Another thing I loved about this show were the various characters that dropped in from other shows I've watched on HBO, mainly from the [[ASIN:B000G6BL42 Oz]] series. As with Hall, these actors broke from the roles I've loved to create fresh, new lives.<br /><br />It's a great series and once I started watching, I couldn't stop! Watched the last 6 episodes in one night, like a crackhead pulling on a pipe.<br /><br />My only gripe was the lack of extras on the DVD. The last disk claimed to have `The Academy of Blood - A Killer Course' yet wasn't on the DVD. Instead it had a bunch of trailers and a few episodes from other Showtime programs. Not bad, I guess, to get us in the mood to watch other programs. But it would have been nice not to advertise something that wasn't offered. Would have liked to see more behind the scenes stuff. Maybe interviews with the cast and crew. Felt a little cheated by that.<br /><br />That doesn't take away what a great series this is! SO glad I own it and am looking forward to seeing the [[ASIN:B000V86OKG Second Season]].<br /><br />Of course, I'll wait until the DVD comes out; not like a bunch of other idiots did who reviewed the show before it was even finished; and still a few more who reviewed the show before it's been released on DVD. Don't know what they were thinking.
B000UJ48SQ|5.0|I am not a very fancy art lover, who spends 30 minutes gazing at the out of focus paintings of monet and trying to come up with some feelings towards it( I tried, and couldn't, to the disappointment of my date!!), I am however, an amateur photographer, I dabble in terms such as Aperture, lighting, kind of a junior. I got interested in Kubrick work when I bought 2001 on blu ray, the equisite depiction of space, and shots of the moon surface were captivating, so I started looking at some of his other work, until I stumbled upon this one.   This is by far the best cinematography I have ever seen, as a matter of fact, Kubrick used a special lense built by Carl Ziess for NASA apollo moon exploration program, with the incredible 0.7 F stop, highest ever used in film history ( up until now no film maker has even tried to use that lense). Certain scenes Kubrick uses three candels to light the entire scene, thats it, a perfect work of art.   This movie is like gazing at the monalisa, and then all of the sudden she starts talking an acting. Actors walk out of portraits on the wall to interact and have a dialog. As with all Kubrick movies, you need to watch it more than once to discover it more. first time I rented this, I was bored within 45 minutes ( most of the story is about some british royalty wearing tight pants), Then four months later I re rented it just to look at the candle scene( I muted the sound), I was debating whether I should buy it or wait for the Blu Ray to come out, but finally I said this is something I need in my personal collection. Definitely a captivating display of images.   If I ran the guggenhiem, I would take off all the Monet and van gogh paintings on the wall, and post frames from this movie up there.
B000006P8I|3.0|Flash back to London, 1967...the heart of Swingin' London, Carnaby Street, Mods...I think you get the picture.    In the midst of all that hubbub was one David Jones; or David Bowie, as he became known...what I love about this album is it's experimentation, and songs that seems to celebrate Music as a form of Art and Expression. Songs like 'Graveyard Digger' or 'She's Got Medals', while hardly comparable to Bowie heavyweights, are a different sort of treat. I think the album can be best described as 'novel, delightful and quirky romp through psychedelia, music hall, and stylish London mod pop' it's not straight acid rock like the Floyd's debut, but mixes it up a bit. It's not all style though - as is often the case with Bowie - there are some songs which (I think, even if their creator might not) stand the test of time...Uncle Arthur reminds me of the Kink's Village Green Society, and the Laughing Gnome always puts a smile on my face. I like Love Me Til Tuesday and My Ching-a-ling, which has a riff that sounds like the machinations of some atonal android.
B0010X73ZG|5.0|Sorry for the play on words but i had to get it off my chest, having said that \\"The Mist\\" has one quality usually missing from most scary movies-it's really scary. Is the story implausable? You betcha-but that's the point of most horror stories-set up a life threatening situation-then scare the bejeezus out of the audience. It has been years since I read the Stephen King novella and I don't remember if the cliche explanation of \\"science gone awry\\" was responsible for the mist and the creatures lurking inside it but the person revealing what is happening does not meet a pretty end.    The movie is extremely gruesome but the most gruesome character is not one of the creatures terrorizing the trapped super-market shoppers but Marcia Gay Hardin as Mrs Carmody the town loony and religious fanatic.  Her continuous rantings about \\"the end of days\\" and \\"Gods vengeance against sinners\\" finally convinces most of the terrified shoppers-but to the directors credit, he shows his disdain for Mrs Carmody by having her talk to her Lord and saviour sitting on the john.    Much has been said about the ending and I agree-it is awful but if the movie had ended with the last act of Thomas Janes' character it would have been horrifying enough but the movie goes on for a few minutes more and what happens hits you like a punch in the gut.    With the exception of the ending the movie is a well made chiller and if you happen to buy the 2 disc set you can also see the movie in black and white.  This gives the movie the feel of a 1950s sci-fi horror flick-but with better special effects and 2008 gore.

B00006LIRI|3.0|I am a U2 fan, have been one since \\"War\\" and happily gobble up their CD's when they are released.  The GH package from their first decade was fantastic...holding the required big hits, plus packaging a disc of B sides.  This effort is more going through the motions.    There are several huge hits on here, as well as soundtrack work that might have been great on another B side disc...but here they are all glommed into one.  It's almost as if the band should have waited or dug deeper for material but figured something had to be released because of the passing of a decade.    It's still U2...but a double disc live album would have been a better package.
B0001Z363W|4.0|Very hard cd to find. took time to get it but it got here in the time i was told it would get here. Item was in decent shape.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|I would have given this ten stars out of ten if possible.  This was a monumnetal achievement by HBO when it was first broadcast and stands up just as well to repeated DVD viewings.    The race to the moon may well be mankinds greatest accomplishement to date.  We had only been practicing powered flight for about fifty years when the dream of taking the bold leap into outer space was made a national mandate by JFK.  In the span of a decade, thousands of the best and the brightest dreamed up how to do it, invented the machines to make it happen, and then invented the tools that they would need to make those machines.    This is not meant as a Discovery Channel Documentary, it is a historical docu-drama meant to entertain and inform...\\"From the Earth to the Moon\\" hits it's mark thoroughly.    The magic for me is how each segment is presented from a different angle.  One focuses straightforward on the Apollo 1 disaster, another looks at the first flight through the eyes of a mock documentary.  Still another is seen through the efforts of the Grumman Corp in designing the lunar lander, while Sally Field directs an episode the tells the story through the eyes of the wives.    All of it makes for great storytelling and grade A television.

B001661RC2|5.0|As much as I loved their previous work, \\"Magic Potion\\" just seemed to be a more refined version of the earlier albums.  I was afraid that a creative wall had been hit.  \\"Attack and Release\\" really feels like new territory...  yet somehow grounded to the blunt honesty that makes the Keys so enjoyable.  Do yourself a big favor and buy this record... and go see these guys live.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|The music is great!  Go see the show!  First CD I've purchased (together with Juno soundtrack) in over 2 years.
B00132D808|5.0|Find some quiet time and listen to this gem under high quality headphones.  It is a piece of work worthy of a careful listen.  I read a criticism that said they were trying too hard to do Sgt. Pepper and could get stuck in a \\"Rutles\\" rut.  The album is obviously influenced by the Beatles (especially the arrangements), but they deserve credit for their own creativity.
B0013BNY2Q|3.0|^^ That's a lyric from \\"I'm Gonna DJ\\" ^^    For reasons only they understand, Amazon also lists the LP version but doesn't link to it from the CD version's page. You can't sell what you don't help publicize, folks.    (And yeah, the songs are energetic and pretty good but not all that memorable.)
B0013FYTA8|5.0|I get sick and tired of people always comparing this band to Nickelback.  The only reason people say this is because they were produced by Nickelback.  I didn't know they were produced by them until after I listened to their first and second cd, and not at one point did I think of Nickelback.  Sure, their not the most original band in the world, but it is a fact that their songs are 100 times better than Nickelback and they get 100 times less credit than Nickelback.      Once again, Theory of a Deadman didn't fail to impress me, excellent songs on every cd, excellent live band, excellent new album.
B0013BNY2Q|4.0|REM's new album plays like an REM retrospective with all new songs: jangley guitars and Mike Mills' harmonies recall Reckoning and Life's Rich Pageant; the mandolin conjures up Green and Out of Time; the insistent nature of the songs and rapidly spat-out lyrical delivery call to mind Document and Monster; and lyrically Stipe seems to be in the mode of New Adventures in Hi-Fi and the more recent post-Berry albums (he even says \\"electron blue\\" in \\"Song for the Submarine,\\" borrowing from their last cd, Across the Sun).<br /><br />In truth, I was a bit skeptical when I heard REM had cut a fast-paced cd that was very self-referential to their earlier cds. For some reason, REM's last post-Berry albums have all failed to connect with the public imagination, and the critics have tended to praise their cds upon release only to bash the previous album when the next came out. It's a shame, because, while none reached the heights of Document, Out of Time, or Automatic for the People, I think they're each really cool albums in their own way. (Sometimes, my wife and I feel like we're the only two people in the world who really like Across the Sun.)<br /><br />Still, it was time for REM to reconnect with their audience, much like Pearl Jam did with their self-titled cd. And, like the pros they are, they pull it off. It's an energetic album - calculated, but energetic. It's great to hear Mike Mills singing his trademark harmonies. Buck's guitar jangles and crunches and demands you turn your stereo up to 11. And the songs are tight. Occasionally almost too short, the songs fly by one after another, but this is the kind of thing Bill Berry used to bring to the band (he was the one, according to interviews, that pushed the \\"don't bore us, get to the chorus\\" philosophy). The cd clocks in at just under 35 minutes for eleven songs, so you know no one in the band was given any time for meandering self-indulgence.<br /><br />The production, playing, and singing is strong throughout, as is the song-writing. I was worried that REM was taking a step back, but they've done what few artists have been able to pull off (U2 and David Bowie come to mind): they've recalled their past while still playing music for today. REM is still as good a band as there is out there. Accelerate is the proof.worried that REM was taking a step back, but they've done what few artists have been able to pull off (U2 and David Bowie come to mind): they've recalled their past while still playing music for today.

B0014Z4OQG|5.0|The thought of telling an oft told story in a different way is very hard to visualize or think of when there are so many fine examples that precede it. However, this movie does succeed in many different ways. The unfolding of the story is where it exceeds most.  The story begins and is carried out almost entirely by a hand held camera. I have to admit, I was ready to exit the theater close to the beginning when the first sensations of something wrong occurred. I was glued after that. What I liked was that the giant beast that destroys New York story was told from behind a camera. What I didn't like was the same thing.  I wish there were more and longer moments when the camera movement wasn't there. Only one scene, when the main characters encounter the beast in central park, where the shot is from a short distance and not from the hand held. It didn't last long, alas.  However, I do highly recommend anyone who enjoys monster movies to see this one. It is well worth your time. It's kinda like Godzilla meets the Blair Witch!
B00000255F|5.0|Recently getting into the rock music culture within the last year, only 18 years of age, I recently discovered this gem, took me multiple listens to recieve and understand how good it is , but now I can't stop listening to it. Im falling in love with this guy, I plan on checking out \\"The River\\" next. 5 stars classic as good as it gets! Up there with The Beatles. \\"You got it, or you don't\\" Bruce Springsteen certainly has it
B000GH2YL0|5.0|Definition of a page-turner, loved it.  The authors got so much out of their interview subjects, the personal thoughts and dialog left you feeling like you were a part of these negotiations.  They portrayed everyone even-handedly when it was probably tempting to make villains out of Ross Johnson or Henry Kravis.  Extremely entertaining, a first class example of literary non-fiction.
B0010YSD7M|1.0|This is an awful attempt to keep SG-1 fans hooked.  However this was an awful try.  We were led to believe that this would be about the end of the Ori story, instead it was a continuation of the replicators thingie. God this was awful.  But I still like all the actors and hope the producers can come up with something better next time.  Thanks
B00006AW2J|5.0|The Rolling Stones have one of the most enviable back catalogues in the history of rock 'n' roll, a fierce musical resume that includes such grand slams as Exile On Main Street, Some Girls, Aftermath, Out Of Our Heads, and Let It Bleed. With a lineup like that, topping oneself is extremely difficult- most bands probably couldn't even make an album as good as Their Satanic Majesties Request, and that's the one that 'Stones fans don't even like! Which is what makes Beggars Banquet such a mind-boggling achievement; even in a discography stuffed with high points, it stands out. Why? Simple: There isn't a single bad song on this thing. No mediocre ones, either. As a matter of fact, what we have here is a collection of ten rock 'n' roll mini-masterpieces, raw symphonic explosions of sleaze and sex and blues and country and Brian Jones and a bunch of other really good stuff.<br /><br />I mean, this album has \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\" on it! Do you have any idea how good that song is? It's incredible! Everything about it, from its surging melodies to its hypnotic rhythms to its apocalyptic lyrical poetry, is just plain stunning, and the performance itself is full of nerve-strangling tension and mounting fury. The other big song here is the rousing working class stomp of \\"Street Fighting Man,\\" which is also just plain great. The other songs deserved to be huge, too. \\"No Expectations\\" is an absolutely gorgeous piece of lovelorn blues, and \\"Jigsaw Puzzle\\" is a surreal gospel-tinged end-of-the-sixties anthem. \\"Dear Doctor\\" is a hilarious (and relentlessly catchy) rural country romp, \\"Stray Cat Blues\\" is distilled sleaze, and \\"Salt Of The Earth\\" is a genuinely rousing ode to the downtrodden. \\"Parachute Women\\" is pure ramblin' blues, and the cover of Robert WIlkins' \\"Prodigal Son\\" is an atmospheric slice of raw rural gospel.<br /><br />So, what you're looking at is simply one of the greatest albums ever made by anyone, anywhere, for any reason. It's the kind of thing you might want to buy. Like, right now.
0061256447|4.0|James Rollins had me hanging on every word with the Judas Strain. There were three very different, very exciting stories that tied into one by the end of the book.

B000J103PC|4.0|While this film highlights how a college student makes the leap from school to professional life, I also believe that it highlights Meryl Streep's enormous talent although she is not the lead character.  She gives such a commanding performance as the dominant impossible boss.  In fact there are several outstanding supporting characters such as Stanley Tucci.  He is priceless as the guy you love to hate.  A really good script, plus great actors equal a great movie!

B000HEWEJO|5.0|This is one of the most beloved movies in film history.  It is very uplifting, and while can be viewed at anytime for a boost, it always has been part of my family's Christmas Eve tradition.  While the colorized version is okay, I prefer the original black and white.  The quality appears to be much better, and maybe that has something to do with traditional expectations also.  I always wonder when they make a movie like this, if they realize it is something special, and how important it will be.

B0006GANOQ|5.0|This is one of those rare action/suspense movies that will far surpass your expectations.  You will be on the edge of your seat a lot because the suspense build up is done that well.  The cast is what impressed me the most.  I knew what to expect with the Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves pairing, but the supporting characters were a surprise as they were outstanding.  Jeff Daniels is always wonderful on screen.  Dennis Hopper was great as the lunatic holding them hostage.
B0000C5RQF|5.0|Diana Damrau is possible the BEST queen of the night ever!!!! She is absolutely S-T-U-N-N-I-N-G here - her presence on stage, very much helped by the costume designed, is just sublime! Visually hauntingly beautiful, music superb, singing EXCELLENT! Keenlyside as Papageno is great, Roschmann as Pamina is very good too (though the costume designer here falted a bit - Pamina is supposed to still be a girl in her early teens - but the costume designed was too revieling for Pamina).      I also have Die Zauberflote from the M22 edition.  Taking both performances as whole, I prefer this one BY FAR!But if you are buying Magic flute for your child, the M22 is better as its more colourful, more entertaining for children, and less obscure! (Papageno is also cooler!!!) For me though, this is the definate one!

0887307280|1.0|I have owned my own business for almost eight years and have enjoyed and endured many successes and hardships.  Facing some of the challenges noted in the jacket, I decided to give it a listen (audio version) while driving.  The book starts in the kitchen of a fictitious pie store where the owner had just \\"had it\\" with her business and called on the author to help.  I got the feeling the whole thing was cheezy and made up to elevate the authors self percieved \\"angel sent from small business heaven\\" image.  The store owner did however have some of the same issues I had faced, and I wanted to find out how Gerber suggested thier navigation, so I listened on. and on and on...  to how if you just dig in and get \\"in touch\\" with yourself, these maladies will just mysteriously go away.  There were a few nuggets here and there about organization, and how you should run your business as if you were going to franchise it, but they were so far buried in a fantasyland of what the author percieved a \\"business in trouble\\" would have for problems, they were hard to dig out.  Besides these things should be obvious to you if you are in business, or attempting a start up, in my opinion of course.       I laughed out loud at one point when the author described a young man who traveled Europe, fell in and out of love several times, got stoned, divorced, re-married, got stoned, fought, went broke, got stoned, and then voila!...discovered he had a talent for writing and a mystical ability of telling people how to run a small business.  Yeah, you guessed it, that young man was the author.  Pure corn.  There has to be better stuff out there than this.
1591841992|5.0|So much of our problem solving effort (personal and professional) is spent finding perfectly reasonable answers...to the wrong questions. After nearly 20 years in both corporate management and strategy consulting, I firmly believe the most powerful tool in any room isn't the computer, the projector or the telephone; it's the white board! A small amount of time visualizing a problem (on a whiteboard or on the back of a napkin) always pays dividends in making sure you're asking the right questions before diving into the solution.    Whether you adopt the author's exact methods or not, this book gives you CONFIDENCE to more consistently use a powerful tool that your brain already understands. Equally important, it invites USEFUL collaboration (even among the most jaded collaborators) since everybody else in the room intuitively knows how to do this too.    Regardless of the types of problems you have to tackle, getting better at simple visualization is a great investment in your own skills.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|This is a good movie.  The story is wonderful.  The picture beautiful and the sound track is one of the best I've enjoyed in a long time.  The extras on the DVD are good too.

It also teaches a lesson about morality to children that is very positive.    Enjoy :o)
0312360266|5.0|Zoey Redbird is about to become a Vampyre. But this fantasy world isn't like many other Vampyre stories, mainly because Zoey's world is very much like our own except for the fact that Vampyre's have always existed...<br />Zoey just wanted to be normal - she wanted to have a normal best friend, a normal boyfriend, a normal high school, go to a normal college and become a normal veteranarian but things don't go so easily for Zoey when she is \\"marked\\" in the hallway of her high school. Aside from the fact that Zoey is about to become a Vampyre even more trouble comes her way! She is \\"gifted\\" with an unusually filled in mark that no other fledgling has. She has more suprises to her than they suspected...<br /><br />Now there are many Vampyre books out there and a lot of them are also in the Young Adult area so you may think that this book resembles many of them but this book is a lot more unique than I'd actually expected and I found it more entertaining than many of the Teenage Vampyre books out there. So I have one last thing to say before I finish my review: Welcome to Vampyre Finishing School!
B000Y8GFY8|4.0|If like me you thought Supernature was Goldfrapp's weakest effort, this album will probably cheer you up.  Supernature sounded to me like a watered-down version of Black Cherry; same basic set of sounds, same approach to songwriting, but only one or two memorable tracks, as opposed to almost a whole album's worth.  Supernature was pretty disappointing not only because their first two albums were better, but because both Felt Mountain and Black Cherry imagined a wholly new sound, something that didn't really sound like anybody else - and Black Cherry barely sounded like the same band that made Felt Mountain.  Seventh Tree moves back toward the acoustic instruments and more atmospheric songwriting of Felt Mountain, but with a much sweeter aura and many of the francopop elements other reviewers have noted.  Paris in the 60s to Felt Mountain's Berlin in the 20s.  It's not as much of a revelation as their first two albums, but it's as much a pleasure to listen to.
B00005JMUA|4.0|And I just feel like laughing at it. KILL BILL. Short simple amusing little title for such a long drawn out oddly serious film. So long in fact that it had to be chopped in two, as we all know. Looking at separate pieces I see nothing to gripe about whatsoever. Most every scene seems perfect. Taken as a whole, I find an overly self-serious, bloated, pretentious film. IMHO, KILL BILL would have benefitted greatly as one film under 2 hours and done more as a comedy rather than a revenge drama.<br /><br />I guess I wanted a revenge comedy. Or a revenge dramadey. And maybe a little bit more focus on just telling this story instead of on what the project was really about, which was a grand tribute to various genres the director grew on. I like trash, and I like art, but I like my trash best when there is no confusing it with anything other than what it is. I don't have as much love for the cr*p as Tarantino. But who really does? That guy is a mutant, a real life \\"Cable Guy\\" that spent his entire youth in a movie theater. So maybe that's why I lack a little bit of appreciation for this homage to cr*p. Don't mean to offend the faithful here. Tarantino is still the man, although I wish he'd quit talking so damn much and work more --I mean, have you ever seen someone as brilliant at self promotion? KILL BILL was six long years after what was that film? And what's he up to now? (I'll look online in a minute.) I still think it's great though, but not as fun (for lack of a better term) as I personally would have preferred. Your maybe thinking, what the hell are you talking about? I mean, I wanted to laugh my a-- off with this one. I wanted BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA sillyness. But that's just my 2 cents.<br />Some highlights from Volume 2:<br />Pai Mei is my favorite character. Michael Madsen gave an Oscar worthy performance as Bud, Bill's brother. Great performances all around. Great soundtrack as always. Visually just a gorgeous picture.<br />From Volume 1:<br />The anime and watching hundreds of Japanese chodes having their limbs removed.Japanese chodes having their limbs removed.
B0002JJBZE|3.0|I grew up knowing practically every line from every episode. I am disappointed in this DVD collection because so many of the episodes are terribly blurry at times. The opening of \\"A Piece of the Action\\" shows the Enterprise bouncing from white to gray...etc. Its weird. At times, the quality is marvelous...other times...its bad!!
B000EWBNMS|3.0|Nowhere near as good as its counterpart, Ghost Whisperer.  Patricia Arquette's acting skills are seriously lacking.  There were several occasions that I thought it was a joke and realized that it was really her acting.  I love the premises of the show but we spend too much time watching Allison and Joe argue in the bedroom.  EVERY EPISODE.  Not to mention that Jake Weber has many scenes where he has to walk around in his boxers, showing EXACTLY what he is packing every time.  Instead of watching something with suspense and ghost stories, I am left with, \\"Oh, another half-naked argument in the bedroom.\\"
B0011ZWMVS|5.0|One of the best soundtracks in recent memory.  Stirring, emotional, completely in tune with the visual layout of The Last Samurai, this is a great sountrack worth listening to and enjoying over and over again.
1594489505|5.0|In the book we see Afghanistan transformed from a very modern city, where women are treated as equals with (most) men. It then goes through the period where Afghanistan is at war with Russia, and the story changes from Mariam to Laila. Laila is only 14 when her friends have all moved from her childhood neighborhood to escape the war. Just as her family is preparing to leave themselves, their home is shelled and both of her parents are killed. She is rescued by Rasheed, Mariam's husband, and forever after their lives are entwined.<br /><br />Once the book reaches this point it takes on a much quicker pace, switching back and forth from Mariam to Laila, telling the story of their life together from each of their perspectives, which eventually becomes one and the same. Once the Taliban takes over we see a stark contrast between the Afghanistan of before and the Afghanistan of today.<br /><br />Reading this book was difficult for me as it was told from the perspective of women. I could almost tangibly feel their anger mounting. They try everything humanly possible to get away from the horrible situation, but they are always betrayed.<br /><br />For them, these experiences really put their lives into perspective. They realize they really don't have any other option. And their husband helps them to see that, always pointing out that without him they'd be out on the street or dead because neither is able to work, nor are they able to be in public without a male companion without risking being severely beaten.<br /><br />If you are interested in Afghanistan, it's culture and it's people, both before and after the last 20 years of conflict, I highly recommend Hosseini's books. He tells the stories of normal people, and he tells it with a balanced hand.
075640407X|3.0|It's hard to love this book, and its hard to hate it.    You are faced with a situation when reading this book, some things are done well, some things are rather boring.  I found myself loving the parts where the main character is a man retelling his story at his Inn.  But the majority of the story is just a flashback to when he was young, and that is where it weakens.      The world the author creates is interesting, but the story that starts to weave in the first part of the book is never really touched on again.  This book is all about setting a background for the main character.  I will probably read the other books, because I want to see what happens, but I am not dying to do so.    If you are ok with the fact that this book essentially is a setup for what could be a cool series then I encourage you to read it.
B0007YN76S|5.0|Before I discovered Sophie Kinsella and her wonderfully wacky stories about Becky Bloomwood, I never though I'd find a chick lit author/book I'd like. The best thing about Becky is that she's so relatable. At one time or another I have found myself in every situation related to me in this book, starting with hoping to win the lottery as a way to pay off my shopping bills.<br /><br />Becky goes through life trying to ignore her piling up bills, or trying to find an easy way out of them and the hilarity that ensues makes this book a fun and easy read. I love the irony of her being a financial advisor. Once you read this book, you'll go out of your way to get your hands on every Kinsella book ever written. And then you'll beg her to write more.
B0013K6WLM|5.0|Smokin' baby, smokin hot crunchy blues rock. this is destined to be a classic; i didn't think they could out do Rubber Factory but this album introduces a dimension of the keys heretofore unseen. Managing to sound well produced and raw at the same time, this is hands down the hottest rock record so far this year. Listen to the hip-hop/blues stomp of \\"So he won't Break\\" and when the squealing lead guitar rips into the groove after the second verse, and you know there is magic going on. The production really emphasizes all of the Keys best assets. \\"Same old thing\\" is equally an equally funky, urban affair. \\"Oceans and Streams\\" and \\"Lies\\" are also standouts. What a surprising Album. Dan says it best on the closing track \\"its about time you see, that things aint like they used to be...\\" and after this album, they surely aint what they used to be, they're even better!
B000OV170W|5.0|In My Sister's Keeper, Jodi Picoult brings to life the questions of stem cell research and genetic engineering through the book's main character, Anna, and her family. Anna, at age 13 has given bone marrow, stem cells and blood to her older sister Kate. And now her parents are asking her to give Kate a kidney as well. After all, it's what Anna was born to do.<br /><br />When Kate was diagnosed with a rare form of Leukemia at age 3, her parents decided to have another child, genetically engineered to be a match to Kate and hopefully to save Kate's life.<br /><br />Now, 13 years later, Anna is tired of being a pin cushion and is seeking legal action to keep her parents from making her give a kidney - which may save Kate, but puts Anna's life in danger.<br /><br />When I first heard about this book, I couldn't understand how anybody wouldn't do everything possible to try to save a family member, but after reading this book I felt I really understood how that type of decision could be made, although it would be difficult. Picoult does an amazing job of showing this from everyone's perspective, including the defending lawyer's position.<br /><br />There were a few cheesy parts in there, and some predictable story lines, but for the most part I found this book to be a well-written and captivating read. And it made me cry, a lot, so it gets a high rating. Also, I found it difficult to believe that Anna was only 13 in the book. Her thoughts and actions seemed much more mature than that of any 13-year-old I've ever met. It was the one thing that kept stopping me throughout the book, but I just had to accept it and move on.<br /><br />All in all I really liked this book. It got me to think about a subject I've never given much thought to. It also really made me think about what it must be like to be a parent trying to save a child with leukemia, and it made me wonder at what point they should give up.
0061544493|5.0|You may or may not like Victoria, but she provides a great perspective of fashion and beauty in this book.  Read the book and let it inspire your own fashion style.  I loved this book.  Worth reading.
0452289963|5.0|I thought this was a great book for people on the spiritual path for a long time, or new seekers. It helps you to understand the totality of the soul the ego and the personality. I am glad this book is reaching many people with Oprah's book club and her teleclass because the planet globally needs to understand we are all here for a reason. It helps inspire self growth and introspection very needed now before the infamous 2012 or whenever the shift comes.
B00004SU5J|5.0|I can't get enough of the beautiful instrumentals with the high energy techno side kick.  In my opinion, this is more on the Jazz side then house or techno category.  Buy it, you just might fall hard for this one as I have.  Good for evening gatherings, for the work commute, and when you want to clean up the house, or dance.  5 Stars here*
B0010X73ZG|1.0|This film really wasn't very good.  I like Tom Jane and he did a great job its just the story was a little... classic horror film.  It reminded me of Evil Dead or Dead Alive with gross things for the sake of gross.  It was just a little unbelievable even for this kind of film.
0618918248|4.0|I just finished this book. Though there were few concepts that were new to me, the reaffirmation is comforting. His writing style is rather light and witty. I appreciate this given the sensitive nature of the topic. Honesty, even it is unpleasent to the opposition, is the best policy. Therefore in some places, Dr. Dawkins gets deadly serious.    I doubt that many people of faith will read this book. My hop is that some that are teetering on the brink might and be enlightened and avoid a plunge into the abyss of willful ignorance that is religon. Dr. Dawkins does a credible job of presenting the case against anti-science.
034537410X|5.0|The world of lucid dreaming is apparently scientifically respected, and for anybody interested, immensely fascinating.    This book offers a plethora of information about the science of dreaming, techniques for inducing lucid dreams, and the history of dream culture.    While you can read it cover to cover, it is somewhat more like a \\"Teach Yourself X in 30 Days\\" book: before proceeding beyond chapters 3 or 4, you should increase your ability to recall dreams to almost one per night. All information required to perform the task is given in the book, and I did have success using these techniques, but it is not necessarily readable like any fiction book.    Let me also say this: with lucid dreaming, whether its a website, a book, whatever, you cannot simply read of techniques and stay interested in the subject to have lucid dreams, you have to work. You'll need to practice dream recall techniques, train yourself to look for dream signs even in your waking life, and generally expect to work for weeks or months before becoming an apt lucid dreamer.    If the topic interests you and you're willing to put forth the little bits of effort in your days to accomplish this task, this is a great and highly authoritative book.
B0015QT78O|5.0|Starman was adventurous, magical and about family.The relationship between Starman and his son was really sweet. I miss it very much and it would be great to have it on DVD.
0321544080|5.0|This is a great book for people interested in the art of photography. If you're about creating truly impactful photos, if you can feel the energy of a pro shooter talking about his profession, his daily experience, his life and it gets your blood boiling and thinking of a career change - then read this book. It will turn the pages very fast.    On the other hand, if you're looking for a 101 on how to take photos with your new DSLR, or figure out how the latest strobist kit works, you will be disappointed. The author does describe the lighting techniques he used in each of his photos, but without reasonable background in the equipment and general lighting technique it won't be detailed enough to replicate it.    The book is structured into a few chapters, each of which is basically a two page nugget structured around a statement, a great example photo that shows why this matters, a discussion in more detail, and a few notes on how the picture was taken. All of this ties together some great insights the authors shares with those that have the patience and drive to dive deep into the art and science of taking emotionally engaging images that tell a story.    Keep in mind that the author made his career in shooting for magazines. Images that are story leads in a magazine need to capture the reader and make him dive into the story, and then they need to wrap around the whole story. Those are great, lasting images. That's also why many of the images in the book involve controlled lighting technique. But you won't find many other photo genres in this book, such as landscape. That's totally ok, because this book is about the energy a magazine shooter experiences and what gets him excited, or gets you excited if you can relate to it in some past or future form.
B000OMD4BG|5.0|This CD was a great treat for me. I liked, but didn't love \\"Figure 8\\" and \\"From the Basement on a Hill\\", his two final releases. But this collection I  love.  I know some people were debating whether to buy or scavenge the internet to find these tracks for free... I think this Double CD is worth owning.  It one of those rare CDs worth hanging the Ipod up a couple hours and popping this into the CD player for the full uninterrupted listening experience.  Great music from a tragic music figure.
B000063DHL|4.0|Still a great album by Maiden but definitely a disappointment compared to its predecessors.  Yes, you can hear the synthesizers starting to creep into to the music and the creative talent starting to slip.  Mostly great songs though but 'Heaven Can Wait' and 'Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner' are just atrocious!!!  If only the latter had lyrics dealing with the runner from the Battle of Marathon then I could relate but the lyrics are just terrible!  I like 'Alexander the Great' but I always thought the song would have been better if Dickinson would have been more poetic about it instead of making the song just a history lesson.  In terms of music, one definitely gets the feeling of less innovation in just about every department except the synthesizers and that's pretty sad for a band like Maiden that just hadn't sold themselves out.  Nothing compared to the abysmal production of '7th Son...' but one can hear the sound starting to get campy and that's my reason for the 4 stars instead of 5.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|I saw this at a GLBT film festival last year and have been waiting ever since for it to release on DVD so I could buy it.  The characters are perfect and the story is written beautifully.  I loved Brad in Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss and love that he did this great film.  Tina Holmes was perfect as the sister and I remembered her from Edge of Seventeen.  This is an all around perfect love story for anyone, gay or straight.
B000063DFN|5.0|This is where Maiden comes to the summit with a great long album that was followed by a grueling world-wide 13 month tour.    Excellent songs where each member shines in his unique contribution.  Fast powerful bass by Harris, awesome drums by McBrain, divine guitars by Smith and Murray, and the strong melodic vocals of Bruce Dickinson.  Although 'Aces High' and '2 Minutes...' are often considered 2 of the best songs on this album, I think 'The Duellist' and 'Flash of the Blade' have some of the best guitar duos on the whole album.  Great work with the title song of course and a good adaptation of Coolidge's poem in which Dickinson recites for us some of the greatest works of British literature.    This is one of Maiden's all-time best albums and just a crowning achievement.  A must for any true metal fan!
B0012OVFHK|3.0|First, be warned that despite the cover with the big 4 on it this is NOT tubular bells 4.  This album consists of two tracks each of which is an arrangement of the first half of the classic Tubular Bells (I).  The first arrangement is for two pianos, and two synths; while the second is for four pianos.  Both pieces are performed by \\"Piano Ensemble\\" which consists of two couples.  I've never heard of any of them before, though that doesn't really mean much.  All said, the album is decent, the arrangements are interesting and played well.  It is obvious that a lot of work went into producing this album, along with a lot of love for Oldfield.  All in all a decent album for the Mike Oldfield collector (which I am one), but don't be fooled, it's not Mike's latest and greatest version of Bells (which he has claimed he is never going to do).
B000063DIR|2.0|I must agree with other reviewers on this version.  This is a great ablum but the remastered version is just terrible.  Robert Trujillo and Mike Bordin just don't muster up to what had been performed by Bob Daisly and Lee Kerslake: not by a long shot.  The drums are virtually mute and the bass is too loud.  Whatever moneys they might want in royalties, Ozzy should just pay up and give us what was before, not this re-doctored crap.  Don' buy this version and get the original with Daisly's and Kerslake's tracks if you can.    This is just false advertisement taking Ozzy fans for suckers and nothing more. To all fans world wide who feel they've been ripped off by this terrible remix labeled 'remastered' and who want to send a message to the music industry to stop taking us for idiots, I would suggest filing a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (F.T.C.) at [...] reporting such sales tactics as being false advertisement in violation of U.S. Federal law. They will investigate it and, given the fact that there is no indication that this album is really a remix of new tracks until you buy it and look inside for the details, they will probably fine Ozzy and the label more than what it would have cost them to pay Bob Daisly and Lee Kerslake their royalties.     Otherwise, this is pretty much the best of the collaboration between Rhoads and Ozzy.  A five-star album with excellent lyrics and great mucial arrangements that were much more thought out than those in Blizzard.
B0013FYTA8|4.0|Radio stations play \\"So Happy\\" too much, and that's too bad because there are 12 other really good tracks on the CD.  TOAD definitely did themselves proud on their 3rd release.      This CD is titled \\"Scars and Souvenirs.\\"  There must've been a lot of scars to write eight tracks about them.  \\"So Happy\\", \\"By the Way\\", \\"Not Meant to Be\\", \\"Crutch\\", \\"Bad Girlfriend\\" (It sounds like a good scar), \\"Hate My Life\\", \\"Little Smirk\\", \\"Sacrifice\\".  Hey, if a woman stomps your heart, write a song about it and make millions of $$$.      I never buy a CD for only one song.  I have to like at least half the songs.  Scars and Souvenirs has 13 listenable songs.  Even if you buy \\"Scars and Souvenirs\\" for the song \\"So Happy\\", you won't \\"be sad\\" about the other 12 songs.  (I couldn't resist).    Enjoy!!!
B000063DFQ|5.0|Piece of Mind is what catapulted Maiden to becoming a leading band with the later release of 'Powerslave.'  They were opening up for Judas Priest during their tour for this album and almost stole the show from another great New Wave english metal band.  This is one of their best albums with great songs such as Flight of Icarus, Die with Your Boots On, and The Trooper.  Their other songs such as Still Life and Sun and Steel are equally great.  Awesome narrative song for 'Dune' with To Tame a Land.  There you have just another great example of the collaboration between Murray and Smith on guitars.  Quest for Fire is a disappointment though: I just never could get into it as not only is Bruce Dickinson straining his voice but the whole concept of the song is just childish in my opinion.  Great introduction of Nicko McBrain's talents as a single-bass drummer and rightly considered one of the best single-base Metal drummers of the 80s.  You just don't miss Clive Burr that much even though he had a great style as well.
0143038419|1.0|I am unsure if perhaps when I skipped several pages of this book to escape the author's narcissictic rambling I missed the best parts. I was very excited to read this book. I remainded excited for about two chapters. The author came across as very whiny and shallow. Although she attempted to add humor to her story, she was unsuccessful. It appeared as though she was desperately trying to show how funny and hip and worldy she was. She was unsuccessful in her attempts to prove she was any of the above. I absolutely hated this book and would not reccomend it to anyone. If you are searching for an uplifting, enlightening book, please continue to look, this is not the one!
B000063COX|5.0|Great intro album from the best new wave metal to come out of England in the early '80s. Some find the band to be truly great with Bruce Dickinson but Paul Dianno has his own vocal range as well which works well with songs such as 'Remember Tomorrow' and 'Strange World.' There's a reason why Dickinson never sang these songs in concert, not because they're bad, he simply doesn't have the voice for them. And, of course, this is the album with which the saga of Charlotte the Harlot begins and is to be followed up in Number of the Beast.
0618918248|1.0|My impression is that Richard Dawkins \\"doth protest too much\\" and to walk away with a sadness that he, like many, adamantly professes a current state of personal nonbelief that more than parallels his much-loathed impression of the belief that Christian fundamentalists display. He rejects all counter-arguments and uses ennuendo and the \\"wink of the eye\\" to imply the foolishness of belief. Personally, I'm convinced that Richard Dawkins does not believe in God...YET!
B000063DI9|2.0|This is pretty much where Iron Maiden stops being Maiden in my book and I would think that I would be the last to say this as a dedicated Maiden fan since Number of the Beast came out.  Compared to what they had produced before, this album is simply the pits.  Aaargh!  Just horrible in every department; lyrically and musically.  The synthesized sound is just overdone and was already overdone in Somewhere in Time.  'Moonchild', 'Evil That Men Do', and 'Only the Good Die Young' are the best songs on this album.  'Infinite Dreams' is also fairly decent.  The rest is pretty bad by Maiden standards and the lyrics are just bland.  'Can I Play With Madness?'  Please; it sounds like a kid asking if he can play on the swing for a couple of more minutes.  Just awful!
0525950079|1.0|I loved the prequel to this book, Pillars of the Earth, and could hardly wait to get my hands on World Without End.  What a huge disappointment. I truly wonder if this book was ghost written, or maybe Pillars was. They don't appear to have been written by the same author.  Poorly written, inconsistent characters, unrealistic and way too prolific sex.  Definitely a one on a scale of 1 to 5.
B0013K6WLM|5.0|I think this is a fantastic new direction for the Black Keys.  I'm a huge fan of theirs, but the only knock I've ever had against them is that if you listen to a whole CD of theirs, the songs can kind of blend together.  They definitely broke that mold with this one.  They do a great job of changing the tempo and getting a great new sound on some songs, but they still show thru as awesome blues rockers on 'I Got Mine' and 'Remember When(Side B)'.  Great effort.  Hope to see them live soon if they come anywhere near me!
0446677450|2.0|He has one message.  Make sure you are financially literate and then buy assets (ie property)...... Spent the whole book repeating this over and over again - yawn!!!!
B000G0O5N2|5.0|Can't miss out on this great movie that's packed with action on a blu-ray. super good picture quality.
B0011QC9U6|5.0|This is an excellent DVD especially in HD DVD. I thought the \\"making of\\" was so interesting. I learned a lot about how this new technology is developing. I am sure we will see more and more motion capture movies in the future.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|I like opera, and it is a given that most of them end with someone dead.  In that respect, Sondheim's brooding opera (let's call it what it is) is an amazing piece of work.    As a stage production, it is much longer, of course, and many have been unhappy about the editing necessary to make a watchable film (opera on film almost always has to be be edited down), but if anything, it made an improvement.  My husband, for instance, found the stage version tedious, but he loved the format of the film.  And in many ways, that is how I measured this film. The level of intensity achieves what is not truly possible in a stylized and lengthy stage play.  It is tighter and more intense, and makes for a very gripping story.    Burton, with Sondheim's approval, gave it the look and feel of a Universal monster classic, with blood added.  Karloff and Lugosi would have been at home here, as well as Lon \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" Chaney and Elsa Lancaster. Visually, it is dark, brooding, mostly filmed in accromatics, with creepy skylines, filthy streets and buildings, perpetual night time thunderbolts, and so many shadows that it seems the sun will never shine again.  Sondheim's music is masterfully served by such visuals.    There have been a lot of films of this infamous urban legend. most of them portraying Todd as variously wicked, thieving serial killer of Victorian melodrama, or even a sad, schizophrenic who only imagines his crimes.  In the Sondheim play, Todd became much more sympathetic, if also a madman.  Under the hands of Burton and Depp, Todd is certainly sympathetic, but he is also incredibly menacing.  You understand him, but you also fear him.  Originally simply obcessed with killing the evil judge (along with his henchman, the Beadle) over grievous wrongs done to him and his unfortunate family, Todd's rage allows him to progress into total psychosis where he is willing to kill anyone who might fall into his hands, and he passes into the realm of a true monster, howeversympathetic he may be.         This is a remarkable film, and well worth watching.  It is thought-provo0king, and one you will watch again and again.    I also recommend the 2-disk version because of many interviews and documentaries that are quite fascinating in themselves.
075640407X|5.0|In all honesty this was one of the best books I have read in five years.  In its seperate aspects you can see excellent character creation, a deep and imaginative world which consists of many countries and currencies and epic events.  The main character is awesome and well drawn and does not lose his sense of humanity.    Nay-sayers on the book claim that kvothe is a dry character with little stress or life.  He observes death...lives in natural and man made wilderness...and unlike most sci-fi main characters has flaws and weaknesses.  Also he is a great character because his power...his gift that makes him amazing is his mind...its amazing to see a main character who does that.      This book not only tells one story...but gives a sense of how legends come into being...in all his stories of past heros...you can see a clear path of a hero...but whats cooler is that by listening to the stories in the book you can see where kvothe evolves into a legend.
6304712499|1.0|As a fan of the character I'd say this is a disappointment especially considering the fact that Todd himself was involved.  I recommend the comics which are available in trade paperbacks or the animated show which is available on DVD because this doesn't do justice for the character.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|This movie is funny and sad. Great actors, great story and Will Ferrell is wonderful as the main character. We loved it.
B000002U8G|5.0|This album is tied (for me) with wish you were here and Animals for the best Pink Floyd album.  I am mainly a metal/hard rock fan.  However, I love Pink Floyd more than any band, why?  That is because of the lgreat voice of David Gilmour with his lyrical guitar playing and Richard Wright pounding on the keyboards while Nick Mason is doing solid drumming while Waters is on the bass.  This album is where Pink Floyd started to sound like...well Pink Floyd.  That probably doesn't make sense since their first CD was Piper at the Gates of Dawn and they should sound like that, however I started with the wall, then Dark Side of the moon, then the rest of the CD's.  This CD has the gem, Echoes, on it.  This is where their true sound started to shine through.  In the middle is swans calling or something which is...interesting and if it wasn't Pink Floyd it would be stupid and silly, however that is Pink Floyd.  This song is 23 minutes long and is a collaboration of everything awesome about Pink Floyd.    *sorry for any wrong spellings
B000K15VSA|5.0|This is one of my best collections. If it's available don't think twice, just go for it. It's wonderful.
B0010358D0|5.0|The sequel to 2004's Appleseed is worthy of its predecessor and absolutely stunning. Dissecting out its components, you have great anime direction, a producer that knows how to make action enticing, intricate conceptual and graphic design, storylines that hold their own lot more than many hollywood live action flicks, a rich original soundtrack and edgy techno sounds lining the action scenes and a love story that binds it all together. You can't lose with Appleseed. There is enough romance, angst, drama, adventure, fight choreography, views and futuristic technology for everyone to find something, or all to like. From the mind of master Masamune Shirow via Shinji Aramaki and John Woo to our screens.
B0000AKY7R|5.0|This recording drew a line in the sand, and those that \\"get it\\" do, and those that don't, well...they never will. 35 years ago I \\"got it\\", and to this day it is still valid as ever. Any comment on the music itself would be superficial at best. Get it, absorb it, let your mind fly free and it will take you somewhere you've never been before. Nuff said.
B000URDEB0|4.0|Dark Passion Play has many songs that will hook you up and make you replay them for times in a row. \\"Bye Bye Beautiful\\", \\"The Islander\\", \\"Amaranth\\", \\"Sahara\\" are among my favorites. The music is as core Nightwish as \\"Nemo\\", strong, passionate and heroic. Great for movie or our personal soundtracks.   It is unfortunate that for whatever reasons Tarja Turunen and the rest of the band broke up. The combination of their music and her voice was amazing. (Sidetracking here to note a bit of bitter irony since they did remake the \\"Phantom of the Opera\\".) When I discovered them I thought my heart stopped somewhere between \\"Beauty of the beast\\" and \\"Sleeping Sun\\".   It's not that Annette is not worthy. She is the one after the amazing Tarja and she's being asked to fill some very big shoes. I think the group decided against an opera voice singer to draw a line between the past and the present. As time passes and if Annette proves to be a keeper for them, her voice will grow into the Nightwish sound.   For the album I give 4 stars, it's not \\"Once\\" but is very good. Won't be dissapointed.
B000O75F7C|5.0|After Deadwing let's just say the bar was set mighty high for the next release, but with confidence this band could ascend to those even greater heights of accomplishment. And ascend they have. The drumming throughout is a brilliant tour de force. The vocals a great match to convey the message. The music and lyrics inspired. The performances tight as always and emotion laden.    Such can be said of many releases from many bands, yet mediocrity remains the result. So, what is different here? If I knew that more than on an emotional level I would be retired to my own island somewhere instead of writing this review. All I can state is the blending of everything here has that magical synergy which lifts this to being a work to landmark status. Leftoverture, Fragile, Master of Puppets, Beware of Darkness etc. and now Fear of a Blank Planet. Yes, it is THAT good. 6 stars.
0810994739|5.0|I just happen to pick up this book for my son in the book store.  After reading the first one in 2 days.  He decided that he wanted the 2nd book and I ordered it from Amazon at a cheaper price.  He is now waiting for the 3rd book.  I am impressed with how much he is reading with chapter books.
B000005RQT|5.0|All the songs are great, for all the people who owns the 25th Anniversary edition, correct me if I'm wrong, I bought the CD, played it and find out that the song Living Wreck skips twice on the intro of the song, I sent it back twice for a replacement and I have the same problem with the CD.

The people who say this isn't a piece to \\"show off\\" your HD setup just.. well I don't know what their problem is, subpar equipment or misconfigured somehow?  My setup is a 40\\" Sony KDL-40v2500 1080p LCD HDTV with a PS3 for my Blu-Ray capabilities, and a Sony sourround system.  I really don't know how it could look any better, other than it being shot with 1080p cameras which didn't exist upon filming.    Sure there are a few seconds here and there were some content was obviously \\"upconverted\\" and not shot natively in HD, but not long enough to really bother me.    I wish it would allow me to give a seperate rating for packaging, my \\"blu-ray case\\" didn't survive very well in shipping.  The tabs on the inside that hold the disc in place have broken, and the other tabs that hold the \\"page turning disc holder\\" were broken upon removing the plastic wrap.    I will be contacting Amazon today to get a replacement, since it keeps letting the discs inside slide around and get scratched.  Not really amazons fault, the plastic the casing is made from is sort of brittle.
0307265730|5.0|With UNACCUSTOMED EARTH, Jhumpa Lahiri can lay claim with good reason to being the finest short story writer in America today. This book, her second collection of short stories with the full-length novel THE NAMESAKE sandwiched between, is a masterful collection of affecting tales about family life and individual self-discovery. While Lahiri's focus is relentlessly drawn toward what might be termed the \\"Bengali-American experience,\\" her stories express rich underlying elements of universality, allowing them to transcend the mere \\"new American immigrant\\" genre. She shows yet again that she is a marvelous craftswoman of the short story art form and its language (words, imagery, and symbolism).     UNACCUSTOMED EARTH is eight stories, divided into two sections. The first section contains five distinct short stories, beginning with the near-novella length title story that is certainly the collection's finest. In that piece, a daughter of Indian descent, Ruma, welcomes her unexpectedly widowered father with trepidation to her new home in Seattle. Ruma is married to a Caucasian named Adam, and they have a young son named Akash. In every respect the young family is a model of mixed marriage and, in Ruma's case, full cultural assimilation. Nevertheless, her father's visit promises to force Ruma to confront the inevitable fissures that appear between first and second generation immigrant families. Travel to new countries or settling into new lands, postcards of foreign places, the  soil in gardening, and measurement of distances all serve in symbolic support to the story's title, but it is a simple misplaced and unmailed postcard that pulls everything together into a poignant ending.     Lahiri's other four stories in the first section have similar themes. In \\"Hell-Heaven,\\" a young woman recalls her childhood when a fellow Bengali became a family friend and part of her (and, surprisingly, her mother's) life. In \\"A Choice of Accommodation,\\" (another title laden with multiplemeanings), a middle-aged, mixed marriage couple (Amit and Megan) rediscover themselves and a bit of their previously unstated history during a friend's wedding held at Amit's old boarding school. In \\"Only Goodness,\\" a model Bengali daughter named Sudha, married and a new mother, tries to cope with her younger brother Rahul's alcoholic failings and her likely role in making him what he has become. Of all the characters in this book, it is Rahul who comes across most powerfully.     The second part of the book contains three intertwined stories involving two characters, one female and one male, at different stages of their lives. Hema and Kaushik are first thrown together by circumstances of the latter's parents having relocated to India and then returned to the Boston area. Hema's family agrees to put Kaushik's family up until they can find a new house of their own, turning Hema's life upside down and even tossing her from her bedroom (now occupied by the three-year-older Kaushik) and onto a cot in her parents room. Tragedy looms behind these events, but it is one which Hema's family is not aware. The first story is told from Hema's viewpoint, the second about three years later from Kaushik's, and the third about twenty years later from both viewpoints. As with her opening story \\"Unaccustomed Earth,\\" Lahiri finds an ending that, while somewhat contrived, is nonetheless touching.     It is only in this final piece, \\"Going Ashore\\" (again a title with multiple meanings), that Lahiri brings her narratives into the present day. The earlier stories appear to take place mostly in about the 1980's, with references to VCR's and record players and telephones with long extension cords. They seem oddly removed from everyday reality, as if they represented a sort of wistful backward stare at a different era, to a time when America was still a shining light on a hill and India was a place to escape before the Internet age and globalization changed some of the balance in their relationship. By the time of \\"Going Ashore,\\" both Hema and Kaushik are adrift in global waters, world citizens who travel freely, lack strong personal attachments, and exist without the roots of family and place and culture that those of the prior generation clearly demonstrated in the earlier stories. Even their careers are disassociative: Hema's as a researcher of the ancient Etruscan civilization, Kaushik's as a photographer of world events who stands forever outside the very events whose images he captures.    If I had one criticism of UNACCUSTOMED EARTH, it would be Lahiri's seemingly incessant focus on one group of Bengalis, the academically-striving, economically prosperous, high achievers. Story after story expresses variations on the same themes from among the same types of people. Lahiri offers repeated mixed marriages (Ruma and Adam, Pranab and Deborah, Amit and Megan, Sudha and Roger Featherstone, Rahul and Elena). Nearly everyone is a PhD - perhaps that is what makes Rahul and Kaushik seem so refreshingly real - and everyone is an academic overachiever whose alma maters would make even US News & World Report blush - Princeton, MIT, Radcliffe, Harvard Medical School, Columbia, U Penn, London School of Economics, Cornell, NYU, Bryn Mawr, Tufts, Colgate, Swarthmore. One character has actually been slumming as a physics professor at Michigan State, but thankfully he's finally on his way to the more acceptable MIT. There must be other Bengalis in America worth writing about, and there must be other stories that do not lead one to paraphrase Tolstoy with, \\"Every happy Bengali family is alike, and every unhappy Bengali family is also unhappy in the same way.\\"     Here's hoping that Ms. Lahiri can apply her brilliant writing skills (...clusters of swallows like giant thumbprints swiping the sky...\\") to a broader canvas in future works; the results promise to be stunning. In the meantime, be pleased as a reader to sit quietly and relish a master at work in these eight compelling and emotionally satisfying short stories. They are well worth the time.
1594489505|4.0|Although it took a few chapters before I really \\"got into\\" Khaled Housseini's A Thousand Splendid Suns, once I was hooked, I could hardly put the book down. Definitely not light reading, the novel educates the reader about historical events in Afghanistan from about 1959-2003 and tells a fictional account of two families across generations.<br /><br />Though fictitious, the well-developed characters could be real. I soon found myself feeling the heartache and misery of Mariam's joyless life and couldn't help but contrast it with mine...and with my many other American sisters. For the most part, we can choose our mates based on romantic love, attain educations, pursue careers, and wear all of the colorful, revealing clothes we choose to don. Another difference between the women of America and Mariam is that she is branded \\"harami,\\" an illegitimate child of a wealthy man. In her culture, being illegitimate is a source of shame and guilt; in America, it's becoming such a common occurrence that people no longer look askance at such situations<br /><br />Still stinging by her father's rejection, Mariam marries Rasheed, an older man who views her as his property and feels no compunction about beating her unmercifully. Years pass, and he brings another wife into the home (I use that word lightly), a young woman named Laila. Mariam and Laila eventually become friends, both devoted to loving Laila's children and to loathing the cruel Rasheed. When Tariq, a friend of Laila's from her earlier life, comes back into the picture, things happen quickly. If you want to find out what happens to this cast of characters, read the book.<br /><br />Again, this is not a light frivolous book, but it is one that will make you think about the good life women enjoy in America while educating you about the history and culture of Afghanistan.

To those of us who grew out of the oppressor/oppressed dichotomy, Klein is tendentious and derivative. Although, to Klein's credit, she does elicit the memories of stoned, plaid-wearing college sophomores trying to explain the incalculable superiority of Cuban health care and literacy to those of 'buffoonish America.'    This book is not worth your time if you have a shred of economic literacy. In fact, I would only recommend Klein to children/teenagers so they can be exposed to and grow out of Marxism faster.

It all makes you consider the larger picture; the proliferation of harmful substances; including, regulation and the standards that protect them. They have to be protected by the likes of Nick; otherwise past inititiaves to protect deadly products would not have persisted as long as it has.
B00132D808|4.0|After having heard some of PATD's singles from \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\\", I had to say I was not that impressed with their music, as there was no distinguishing them or their music from all the other soundalike, sellable crap bands that gluts the airwaves. And since I so rarely listen to reviews, it was even more strange that I felt compelled to buy this album, when I had read a few glowing reviews for it. But what pulled me in was that they made reference to The Beatles and The Beach Boys, two bands I feel revolutionized the album as the art form we know it as today. Having heard a few cuts on their MySpace page, I decided to see for myself.    So, that having been said, Pretty. Odd. is no Sgt. Pepper, or Pet Sounds. But it is very very good. And MUSICALLY interesting, something in my opinion most mainstream bands aren't these days. I can see how this would NOT appeal to PATD's fanbase, but musically and to its credit, it's all over the map. It's almost like a  quirky compilation of different bands, stylewise. On first listen I liked it but every repeated listen draws me in even more, and I end up hearing things I missed or didn't pay attention to before. \\"Nine In The Afternoon\\" could be a long lost Electric Light Orchestra single, and \\"She Had The World\\" could pass for something The Partridge Family performed in their maroon velvet suits, with what sounds like a harpsichord featured prominently in the mix. Even the cover artwork alone looks like something one would find tucked away in a record bin in a fleamarket, with its antique looking border and colorful floral print.     I'm very glad these guys took such a big departure and kicked this sound to the left of what people would expect from them, and what worked so well for them last time around. If you liked the first album, you may not find anything that's your cup of tea in this one. But if you would like to hear an album you can actually get excited about and hear things like banjos, harpsichords and on \\"I Have Friends In Holy Spaces\\", vocals coming through a gramophone that sounds like I should be at a speakeasy in the 20's-pick this album up. It's just what we need as a remedy to what has become known as Top 40 radio.

Being used to menu options for multiple spoken and subtitled languages, we thought it ridiculous to have to buy BOTH the English -only- and Spanish -only- versions.

The written items critical to the plot were in Spanish (trophies, newspaper, leader board, etc). Now we wish other movies would do the same

It works very well as a tie in to the liner notes she writes about her stay in the French capital.

It wasn't an easy journey but you will experience it with him and feel his pain and heartache as you travel across the country and world.<br /><br />In simple prose you can easily follow along the story and at times feel you are with Beah being shot at and killing Rambo style. The human spirit is amazing. Ishmael is my age - but our stories have no similarities, nothing I have experienced compares to his. I could not put down his memoir once I started reading.

This is what these three fine young men from Athens, GA did and the final product they delivered after a hiatus of four years couldn't be better. \\"Accelerate\\" is a subtle mix of old school R.E.M. from the IRS years to the mainstream appeal from Warner Bros. years. The CD-only version is relatively short (running 35 minutes or so only) and has great tunes. Michael's singing style is more passionate than ever. The band still plays consistently and vigorously. This is a top release for the Alternative Rock genre this year. Yes, they're mainstream for a while, but still makes alternative sound. Thanks God.

It is certainly not a literary masterpiece, but it's not trying to be. There are too many laugh out loud moments in this book to count, that reason alone is enough for me to read it. But the romance is also very cute and fun. Bring it with you on a plane, on a beach trip, or curl up with it on a quiet evening alone. It will definitely bring a smile to your face.
B0010358CG|3.0|I thought this movie was ok.  The first was still better and the voice changes and character changes threw me out of the movie fairly often.  I think there was to much of a focus on the romantic relationship which I honestly didn't care that much about.
B0013BNY2Q|3.0|Yes, this album \\"rocks\\" compared to the last ten years of REM studio releases, but the songs are for the most part a couple of notches below what we came to expect in the '80's and '90's.  That's most apparent in their recent concerts, where the new songs are intermingled with older ones, and they don't stand up well.    On top of that, it's a ridiculously short album by today's standards.
B00005MP58|5.0|To me this is the best version of Jane Austen´s famous book.

Scenery is beautiful and the historical reconstitution seemed better than other movies I have seen. Unfortunately, I was only able to see the second part of the movie, because the first disc came with some defect (bad disc) and that spoiled somewhat, not totally, the joy of acquiring this product.

B00013RC66|4.0|This sly, underrated 1987 crime thriller from Bob Rafaelson is carried by the excellent work of its two protagonists, played by Theresa Russell and Debra Winger.  While its premise hardly breaks new ground in either the broader genre or its subset (films in which the identity of the killer is known from the beginning), the sexual innuendo that emerges between the hunter and the hunted feels fresh because of the charisma of the two stars.<br /><br />The film opens as Catherine Peterson (Theresa Russell), is heading back to New York City from a trip because of the sudden death of her husband of only two months, Sam, a wealthy publishing magnate quite a bit older than she. Catherine is beautifully and stylishly dressed, a real \\"Fifth Avenue Blonde\\".  Although she hugs a photo of her dead husband to herself as she weeps on their bed when she returns home, the first thing she has done is empty the remains of his brandy bottle into the bathroom sink and wash it out.  The viewer sees just enough to be initially uncertain as to who and what Catherine is, as she seems genuinely overcome with grief.<br /><br />However, the viewer is not left in doubt for long, because Catherine is next seen as a blowzy redhead in a tight dress with long red nails, speaking with a southern accent, charming Ben, her latest, older husband (Dennis Hopper, in a brief but hilarious cameo) - a wealthy toy manufacturer. Within two months, Ben has mysteriously died of unknown causes (although by now the audience knows that his bride injected a hard to detect poison into his unopened brandy bottle).  However, this time \\"Catherine\\" runs into trouble in claiming her rights under her husband's will: his sister (Diane Ladd) threatens to contest it, claiming she has investigated the young widow's claims of her family's origin, and found them to be false.  Catherine buys the sister off with a large cash gift from the estate.<br /><br />It is at this point that Alex Barnes (Debra Winger) comes into the picture. An analyst for the Justice Department, Alex is very good at what she does, searching for patterns that may point to criminal activity, but she does it in a little cubicle, sitting at a computer, in an office with windows that are blacked out with green paint.  Alex is bored and desperately wants a field assignment that will get her out of the office.  Although Alex is pretty, she doesn't date and it is hinted that her lack of a private life and her persona as \\"one of the boys\\" has raised questions about her.  At the least, we see that she lacks confidence in her femininity and has submerged all her longings into her job.<br /><br />One day Alex tells her boss that she has tagged a series of deaths of wealthy older men that have been diagnosed as \\"Ondine's Curse\\" (apparently healthy middle-aged men dying in their sleep for no reason).  But Alex has connected what she thinks is the same woman with two such recent deaths (the film's first two dead spouses), and thinks it's murder, not Ondine's Curse.  Alex begs her boss to let her take the field assignment and see if she can find the woman and prove the cases were murder.  He grudgingly consents, and Alex heads first to Manhattan, where, after a visit to her quarry's first ex-sister-in-law, she obtains a photo of \\"Catherine\\" (the real name of Russell's character is never revealed).  Alex's next visit is to the greedy sister-in-law whose suspicions about Catherine were silenced by that large gift, although the gift does't stop her from repeating her suspicions to the lady from the Justice Department.<br /><br />Next Alex tracks \\"Catherine\\" to Seattle, where the tacky redhead has morphed into \\"Margaret\\", a sedate, intellectual, quietly dressed, brown-haired woman interested in the Native cultures of the Pacific Northwest.  Of course, what she is really interested in is William McRory (Nicol Williamson) the retiring, shy, middle-aged millionaire who curates a museum devoted to the Coast Salish peoples, and who leads its Board.  Catherine/Margaret, through a million-dollar gift to the museum, gets herself a place on the Board, and in no time at all she has seduced and married McRory, a charming man who also happens to be allergic to penicillin.<br /><br />At this point, Catherine/Margaret suddenly becomes aware that someone is on her trail.  Alex has managed to get to talk to McRory by posing as a free-lance journalist who wants to do an article on his wife.  When McRory tells Catherine/Margaret this, she makes a quick call to her erstwhile sister-in-law in Manhattan, who says that yes, a young woman from the Justice Department has been asking questions.  Frightened and infuriated, Catherine/Margaret decides it's time to get out of Dodge, and asks her doctor for some penicillin for the tonsillitis she is so susceptible to in Seattle's damp climate.  Soon afterward, the gentle McRory is dead and no one finds the traces of penicillin crushed into his toothpaste - the diagnosis is heart failure brought on by anaphylactic shock, from unknown causes.  Alex's enraged accusations to the local police fall on deaf ears - they refuse to reopen the case.<br /><br />McRory's death is the final convincing evidence for Alex that Catherine/Margaret is indeed her serial murderer - what is more, Alex liked the scholarly curator and she feels guilty for not warning him of his danger, unlikely though it is that he would have listened to her.  Now, her need to capture the Black Widow is driven as much by a sense of guilt and responsibility as it is by the thrill of the chase and ambition.<br /><br />Alex then tracks Catherine/Margaret, now calling herself \\"Rennie Walker\\", to Hawaii, where she already has her fangs in her next victim, an international hotel tycoon, Paul Nuytten (Sami Frey). It is here that Alex and \\"Rennie\\" finally meet, in a scuba diving class, as the intricate, final phase of the dance between Alex and the Black Widow begins, and the charged, ambivalent relationship between the two women begins to emerge.<br /><br />It is unclear whether Rennie knows immediately that her new friend \\"Jane\\" is Alex the investigator.  But they become close friends very quickly.  Rennie lends the unkempt Alex a cocktail dress and sends her to her own hairdresser, and Alex shows up that evening at a party at Paul's palatial estate looking transformed. It becomes clear as she gets to know Rennie, that even in the full knowledge of Rennie's crimes, Alex is wistfully envious of Rennie's sexual confidence, style, and skill with men, and that on some level Alex wishes she were more like Rennie.  In one scene, when it becomes clearer that Rennie suspects that she is talking not to her new \\"friend\\" but to her hunter, Rennie tries to explain that she loved all her husbands deeply and that the problem is, no amount of money is enough money to make her feel really safe.  Russell handles this ambiguity well: conveying admirably that her character has enough insight to recognize the potent forces driving her but not enough sanity to challenge them.<br /><br />Rennie next encourages a brief fling between Alex and Paul - she has seen that Alex is attracted to Paul, and that Paul is intrigued by Alex's innocence and reticence, although he has been pressing Rennie to marry him.  Paul obliges Rennie by making love to Alex, while Rennie hires a sleazy private detective (James Hong) with a heroin addiction to photograph Alex and Paul together.  As soon as he gets the photographs, Rennie murders the detective by holding a gun to his head while forcing him to take an overdose.  Then, Rennie finally agrees to marry Paul, who breaks off the affair with Alex.  Remembering what happened to McRory, Alex tells Paul who she is and tries to warn him about Rennie, but Paul refuses to listen, and indignantly points out that with Rennie's agreement, their estates have been left to the Cancer Foundation.<br /><br />By this time, Alex is aware that Rennie knows who she is, although Alex also knowsthat Rennie knows there is still no substantive proof of Rennie's actions that would stand up in court.  After her marriage to Paul, Rennie feels reasonably secure, but Alex comes to Rennie and Paul's wedding and gives the bride a brooch in the shape of a Black Widow spider.  Rennie murmurs that she's enjoyed their relationship, and that \\"Truth is, I'm sorry it's over.\\"  Alex replies, \\"The truth is, it's not over yet.\\"  Rennie knows then that she has to get rid of Alex and springs the trap she has prepared: Rennie plants the poison she will use on Paul in the cheap cottage Alex has rented, and goes off on one of her \\"trips\\" - sure enough, she is called back suddenly when Paul is found dead, another victim of Ondine's Curse.  The police find the body of the detective and the photographs of Paul and Alex embracing, and Rennie insists that the only person who really had reason to murder Paul is the rejected Alex, and the police search Alex's cottage and find the poison.<br /><br />After utilizing a little-known testamentary clause that allows her to cancel Paul's bequest of his entire estate to the Cancer Foundation, all signs point to the Black Widow having trapped Alex, rather than the other way around.<br /><br />This is a stylish, well-played story, and this reviewer has watched it several times over the years with the same enjoyment.  It is not so much the actual plot (which has some quite far-fetched moments) as the work of the actors that is so engaging, as they shape their portrayals of two women who are so different yet so oddly in sync with each other.  It is particularly pleasurable watching Russell shift identities as she stalks her victims and adapts to their tastes, interests, and cultural backgrounds.

B0009IW88A|5.0|I love this soundtrack, a component of a fabulously made film!     Just watching the DVD on how they made and developed each aspect of the movie - the end product shines as a highly credible and 'believable' story. The restraint shown, inspite of the subject's 'fantastical comic book heritage' lends authenticity to the whole piece, the actors, the sets, the performances, are beautifully enhanced by this muscial score.     Bruce Wayne/Batman - the turmoil, discovery of purpose, and resoluteness in following his purpose is cleverly portrayed through each track. This begins to set a recurrent 'anthem' which the audience begins to recognise, and starts the 'spine tingling' in anticipation akin to the OO7 theme striking up in a Bond move - the excitement that something important featuring the central character is about to happen. Can see this score as a crtical part of the armoury that will (and should) be deployed in the following Batman movies.
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|WHAT A GREAT ALBUM,  THANK YOU REM.  I was about to give up on the recording industry.  I thought that I would be stuck with my 80's music (which turns out is timeless and still great) but this is really fresh, powerful, and the best new stuff I've heard in a while.  And, the DRM-free download from Amazon was a snap.  Amazon is my new number one stop for music.  5 stars REM and Amazon.  (NO, I don't work for Amazon)
B00004X10B|5.0|As others have mentioned this bag holds a lot of gear. One of the biggest selling points for me is that is that is can be used as your second carryon on an airline. As big as it is, it is designed to fit under the seat, so it counts as your hand held carry on. I've traveled with it many times and never had to gate check it. It's a little tight on the commuter planes, but I've always been able to carry it on to the plane with me.<br /><br />Generally I have two camera bodies and an assortment of lenses, flashes etc. It has separate compartments for extra flash cards and batteries as well as a few other pockets useful for battery chargers, note books etc.<br /><br />Update 8/6/2014 - I'm still using this bag for Airline travel and have not yet had to check it.  I recently flew Allegiant  Air which has stricter carryon requirements. This bag does not meet their stated requirements. After looking at other bags, I decided to stick with this one.  I just made sure I did not fill it to capacity. It turned out to be the right decision. I was not questioned in either direction. It was good that I had filled it less than normal as the space under the seats was lower than I had previously experienced. With nothing in the top pouches, I was still able to get it under the seat (It was a tight fit).
B000WTBMBK|4.0|A minor change in tone can make a big difference. Burial's second album comes across as more listenable and original than his first, even though his compositional style has mostly stayed the same. He still uses the same jerky, bone-dry rhythms that characterized the first album, on many tracks like \\"Near Dark,\\" \\"Ghost Hardware,\\" and \\"Untrue.\\" These beats still sound interchangeable -- hurried and nervous, occasionally missing the beat (deliberately, according to Burial; he doesn't like his drums to sound too precise) but without real hooks to make them stick in the mind.    There are also quiet moments like \\"Night Bus\\" from the first album, but this time there are many more of them. \\"Endorphin,\\" \\"In McDonalds,\\" \\"Dog Shelter\\" and \\"UK\\" are all soft ambient interludes. Untrue also uses more vocals than its predecessor, and this time they are less heavily treated and thus more recognizable as human voices. So, the ambient tracks are graced with gentle soul crooning, with the usual melancholy production, that makes them sound like torch songs reimagined for Burial's desolate image of contemporary London.    What's missing from this album is the sense of dread. There's nothing as lonely and eerie as \\"Distant Lights.\\" There's less echo and reverberation overall, so Untrue never quite attains the same stark, sombre mood. The bass and tape hiss are also less oppressive and murky, so even though the drum tracks are very similar to some of the middling songs from the first album like \\"Wounder,\\" they seem a little lighter here. That's the minor change in tone that greatly changes the overall impression. In an interview, Burial characterized the album as more \\"glowy\\" and joyful than its predecessor, and he's right, not because it's really all that uplifting, but because those few darkest mood pieces are absent. As a consequence, Untrue recalls Bryn Jones less frequently than the first album (although I still think he provided a lot of Burial's inspiration), which makes it soundmore original.    The lack of a \\"Distant Lights\\" or a \\"Gutted\\" is a bit disappointing, since the apocalyptic feel was the most impressive aspect of the first album. But to make up for that, Burial makes a few concessions to mainstream dance music. Which is a good thing. Not only does it not compromise his music (which he remains as earnestly concerned about as ever), it results in his best work to date. \\"Archangel\\" in particular is the closest he's ever come to a hit single. It employs all of his usual earmarks -- warped vocals, hollow drums, echo -- but arranges the vocal sample into a concise, standout hook. The voice is singing some sentimental line, but the production renders it only half intelligible and thus mysterious, and the distortion gives it an unearthly sound to fit the title.    \\"Etched Headplate\\" features an even more striking manipulation of vocal samples. It starts with a long intro consisting of background noise suddenly and powerfully punctuated by deep bass chords. Then a fairly standard dance beat kicks in, soon joined by vocals. As always in Burial's music, the vocals are distorted and cut up, but here the vocal fragments are arranged to move with the beat and rhythmically snake around it. I kind of wish he'd done this with the entire song from which he took the sample, rather than just repeating the same couple of lines, but even as it is, the track is an otherworldly dance-dirge, with echoing gibberish as the main rhythmic hook. The way the vocals flow with the beat makes this the single most original and memorable track on the album.    \\"Shell Of Light\\" is written along similar lines, with less elaborate vocals. This time the hook consists of one word, repeated in distorted falsetto. It sounds almost like some kind of disco chorus, but that's exactly why it's interesting to hear it in tandem with a dark, bass-heavy Burial production. And then, at the very end, there's \\"Raver,\\" which follows all the rules of classic eighties house, with a simple beat backed by vocal samples and warm strings. But this is also presented the Burial way -- the warm strings are a bit muted, they always seem to rise from the background without ever really taking the lead. This reflects Burial's sentimental attitude toward old rave music, and exemplifies the \\"downcast euphoria\\" that he wanted to portray. Paradoxically, despite the classicist structure, it's actually one of Burial's most distinctive creations. Instead of a big triumphant party atmosphere like \\"Strings Of Life,\\" \\"Raver\\" suggests a minor emotional thaw or a moment of vulnerability.    Untrue isn't perfect. I think many of Burial's ideas are still unrealized, even here, mostly due to the long \\"clattering\\" tracks with similar rhythms. It's not like Burial cares about my opinion, but I wish he'd reconcile the danceable strain in his music, as depicted here, with the doomy dark-ambient touches in his first album, and ditch the tedious, rattling middle of the road between these extremes. But any dance producer working today should be listening to this album -- Burial is one of the few musicians whose work suggests some kind of coherent image of his time, even if its creator has yet to fully articulate it.
1419336916|5.0|I often read on back covers that a book is a tour de force, but this is the first time I've really thought it myself! Even if you've seen the movie, which is quite good, the book offers so much more. McEwan delves deeply and honestly into the thoughts of each of his characters creating a a masterful interplay of perspectives. The account of Briony's stream of consciousness transported me back to age 13. I think that McEwan embodies his charcters so completely that he includes all the quirky patterns of thought that hardly anyone speaks aloud or writes about, but everyone must experience.  The narrator has a lovely, rich voice with a British accent and gives different characters slightly unique inflection and pacing, but not distractingly so. I listened to this on a long road trip and the miles just flew by as I was so riveted.
B0010358EE|5.0|The visual effects are breathtaking. The action sequences and fight scenes are creative and very cool. The story is good, but my problem is with the idea that the police will save humanity.    I think the movie deserves four stars, but the fifth star is for the price. The HD DVD combo format costs less than the regular DVD, and the DVD version is included! Even if you don't have an HD DVD player, you should buy the HD combo disc.
0743496736|5.0|I read the book Nineteen Minutes.  I thought the book was very well written.I thought the author put a lot of thought into the characters in the book. The author made you look at both sides of the story.  I enjoyed reading this book.  I would highly recommend this book.
B0010ZR160|4.0|its great seeing Casey Affleck get a chance to shine in this movie.  Its well directed by his bro Ben Affleck.  Something about him makes me want to know what happens to not only his character but Ed Harris, Morgan Freeman and Michelle Monaghan (his partner in their detective agency).  It revolves around a 4 year old girl that has been kidnapped from her home.  Such as it is because the mother is an alcoholic and drugged out poor excuse who leaves her child home to be watched by other people.<br /><br />The film itself which runs almost two hours manages to keep the pace going along steadily with all kinds of plot turns, twists and different agendas that the other characters have in the movie.  They all turn out to be important leads to Casey having to make a major decision that will not affect him but others around him as well.  Will he make the right or wrong choice? One way to find out check out, Gone Baby Gone and see what it has to offer.
0345455681|5.0|Quite simply, I loved this novel.  I have no problem with lengthy texts if they are engaging, and I never found this less than fascinating.  In my opinion, a better read than \\"Sarum\\" or \\"The Forest,\\" both of which I also enjoyed.
0385335482|2.0|I am happy for Rebecca at the moment, but her story, perhaps necessarily, has not drawn to a satisfactory close.  I am not in the 'demographic' for this novel, I simply liked that the name of the author was called Sophie.  The audio book reader was FANTASTIC, I say brightly.    Still, I cannot see pleasure in the confessions of someone so outrightly deceiving themselves and others.  If it were not for the audio book performance, and even with that, I almost abandoned it.  Fair to say it caught me up at the end of the day.    Having endured the agony through and through, I'd place this just above a worthless read.  Maybe those who can identify with Rebecca will wake up a bit (and smell the Morning Coffee).  Still... we are not sure that she has.    In short: Agonizing and dissatisfying.

B0014Z4OQG|4.0|I always wondered what would happen if you place a giant monster in the streets of NYC - other than complete and utter chaos. This movie is very clever. It's godzilla meets blair witch.     The intro is kind of boring because the movie takes too long introducing the characters. Once you get past that, it's a rollercoaster ride (with motion sickness).
B000000W5B|5.0|Why do we need to compare this album and It's Only Rock n' Roll to Exile? Both are great albums that stand on their own! Can you hear the music?
1594489505|4.0|I didn't \\"enjoy\\" the book for I felt such deep sorrow, frustration, and helplessness for those women living in that time and space as depicted in the story. However, as with The Kite Runner, the author was able to convey a very important message to his readers, that is, in a math equatation, \\"Afghanistans\\" does not equal to \\"terrorists\\". I have to admit though that the only reason I could finish both books was because I listened to both of them as books on tapes, otherwise, I can see myself getting impaitient with alot of the details as mentioned by other reviewers.
B000000W5H|5.0|Just another brilliant album from the greatest band in rock history. Not a weak track on the album. Like Goat's Head, Mick's vocals are adventuresome. Like rediscovering an old friend these 70s Stones albums are just a fantastic treat!
B00132D808|5.0|This album is LEAPS and BOUNDS better than their first! Fever had a few good songs...but this album has 15 phenomenal songs. It's great to hear a band acknowledge there influences and not make a disaster out of it. Great job Panic...keep exploring.
B00104QSOM|5.0|When is a \\"Collector's Edition\\" not a collector's edition? When the second disc barely has an one hour's worth of additional featurettes and other extras. \\"There Will Be Blood\\" deserved to be recognized as one of the finest films from last year. That's not to say the film is perfect but its flaws are pretty easy to overlook because of Paul Thomas Anderson's sweeping and ambitious storytelling. I'd recommend the single disc edition as the \\"Collector's Edition\\" doesn't have all that much in the way of extras. The single disc edition is really all you need even though it doesn't have ANY extras.<br /><br />The packaging for this set is horrible (which I could forgive if the discs weren't scratched up in the process). How did this get past the marketing department at Paramount?<br /><br />\\"There Will Be Blood\\" based on Upton Sinclair's novel OIL! gives us two portraits of two very different men both ruled by their own obsession--Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis in his Oscar winning role who seems to be channeling John Huston from the film \\"Chinatown\\")an oil man who in spite of his impressive skills as a smooth talking salesman, doesn't like people very much (aside from his son H.W. which he uses to help sell people that his is \\"a family business\\") and Eli Sunday (Paul Dano)a smooth talking healer and leader of the Church of the Third Relevation. Both men want wealth and power for Plainview its a means to escape. While Sunday sees the oil leaking out of the ground of his father's ranch to gather a flock, reach out with his message and, in turn, gain the power that he believes he deserves. The two men don't get along from the moment they meet--Eli is on to Daniel's \\"plain speaking\\" way of doing business and getting something for next to nothing and Daniel believes that Eli is a charlatan. In their own way each is a hard nosed uncompromising businessman with visions that don't mesh.<br /><br />The DVD:<br /><br />Robert Elswit's cinematography deservedly won an Oscar for the film and while the DVD transfer looks good, the night sequences are a bit murky and dark. Detail overall is pretty good with a color scheme that accurately captures the theatrical look of the film.<br /><br />Audio sounds terrific nicely reproducing Johnny Greenwood's score.<br /><br />There are no extras on the first disc which has a menu as plain as Daniel's view of the world. The second disc features a vintage silent featurette that runs about 27 minutes and uses Greenwood's score to accompany it. It tells the \\"story\\" of oil and shows us how oilmen hunted for it and brought it to market.<br /><br />We also get \\"15 Minutes\\" a collection of vintage stills from the era taken around oil sites, behind-the-scenes footage and various clips showing all the work that Anderson and his crew put into researching the film. It's a silent segment accompanied by music and lasts, yep, just over 15 minutes.<br /><br />Next up we two deleted scenes that last nearly ten minutes. Under three minutes \\"Dallies Gone Wild\\" is an alternate take of the restaurant scene involving Daniel, his son H.W. and employees of Standard Oil.<br /><br />We also get the teaser for the film and the original theatrical trailer both of which remind me of the lost art of crafting a great trailer that will pull in an audience without giving away too much. All things considered, this is a disappointing \\"Collector's Edition\\" even with the awkward collectable packaging that is included (where the discs slide inside) and would be prone to damage with time.<br /><br />Conclusion: A powerful, terrific film and one of the ten best from 2007, \\"There Will Be Blood\\" appears in a disappointing special edition from Paramount. The film looks fine and the soundtrack is brilliantly rendered which should be enough to get fans to purchase the single disc DVD and that's what I would recommend.<br /><br />The extras on disc two of the \\"Collector's Edition\\" are slim pickings to say the least. It's as if Paramount rushed topull this material together in light of the Academy Award nominations and wins the film scored. They are very disappointing for a two disc edition and I can't strongly recommend the two disc edition based on this. If you just want the film, go for the single disc edition and wait to see what the Blu-ray comes packs in the way of special features.<br /><br />A reminder...Voting at amazon.com is about whether or not the review helped you decide to purchase the product NOT about whether or not you agree with the reviewer.

B000JSI7AI|5.0|I think this is a wonderful love story that displays the biases in our society, preventing select groups of people from being whom they truly are.  In my opinion, this is a great movie for all to see.  As well, this highlights the late Heath Ledger as a daring and talented actor.  This does pay tribute to him.  A broken mold this movie is with Hollywood finally taking a chance in this direction for a mainstream film.  Congratulations on all who participated.
B000O59AF2|4.0|I have the standard DVD which was good but the HD DVD is super;highly recommended.  As for the movie,it is good but the main point is that it is one of those few movies which allows repeated watching without becoming boring.  One of the reasons why it is so, is that it will make you go back to 'CIA break in' and wonder how they did it;being a SINGAPOREAN, I think they made it look too easy to infiltrate the CIA.  Thanks
B00133KFGW|1.0|I don't know where you were when you saw this, but I was trapped on a plane and almost hypnotized by how deeply rotten to the core it is. The term \\"fairy tale\\" keeps getting applied to this film, but real fairy tales are carefully crafted allegories, not excuses for insipid and unbelievable storytelling. To say that it is just overly sentimental is also far too kind because this kind of \\"product\\" is, of course, the result of multiple test-screenings and demographic considerations. In fact, if ever a movie wanted to pander and please every possible viewer / paying unit, it is this one. Stretched beyond thin, it is as if it was robotically assembled; \\"pull heart-string A, add sweeping music, insert flashback B (in slow motion), etc.\\" And it STILL manages to sink even lower with yet another one-dimensional portrayal of a human, as caricatured by Robin Williams (who is as naturally \\"street\\" as Kathy Lee Gifford)!     Most offensive, however, is that \\"August Rush\\" ultimately purports to be about the universality and power of art as a mysterious and yet uniquely human language. Yet in it's air-tight bubble of calculated cliches and manipulative schmaltz, it has completely suffocated the very elements that allow for true art to exist. There is no better example of this than in how the film repeatedly illustrates the boy's relationship to music. In the very opening scenes, the director has chosen an internal voice-over to verbally explain how August feels about music in his world, rather than employ the almost limitless language of cinema to creatively show it. Oh, we get lots of sweeping MTV crane and helicopter shots, but this is not what I'm getting at. In this opening voice-over, August explains how music and rhythm is present in almost every facet of nature itself. It's hardly a new idea, but a potentially challenging and beautiful one to consider. Still, the filmmakers won't allow you to actually experience or engage with this philosophy first-hand, which they could have. Instead, for every visual example they provide; the wind, the birds, the urban environment, etc., they have chosen to lay ACTUAL music over, drowning out whatever discoveries you might have shared with August for yourself.     This film has nothing to do with art, or even human beings, really. It's a total betrayal of its subject matter and mistrusts its audience on every level. It offers no challenges or discoveries and, without these, there can be no fairy tales, only mounting successions of highly improbable coincidences, delivered D.O.A., in a pantomime of wonder. Anything by Ed Wood was more heart-felt than this!
0452286751|4.0|The Fountainhead, a book that is worshipped for its creator's ideals, is often put forth as a great collection of philosophy. Its general idea is that only through the greatness of the singular human spirit can greatness be accomplished. Collective knowledge fails, and if everyone is given freedom the world would be perfect.    The book is long, the characters are unreal, and the story deteriorates as the character's become less of themselves and more as vectors for Rand's philosophy. She forgets that they have specific characteristics and they become dull and flat throughout. She condemns any person believing in helping their fellow man as Collectivists, portraying them  as evil through the story.     Rand's philosophy comes more to the front than the characters do. Unlike Anthem, where her ideals were acting on the characters, The Fountainhead's characters are acting on the philosophy. They act on nothing but extremes: either following her rules or blatantly deny everything she believes. She twists the quotes she uses to make the antagonists unlikeable. They have no souls.    The main character, Howard Roark, was her idea of the perfect man. The book was written about, and for, him. He isn't human, he is her philosophy. It seems as if the whole world is against him: a very typical stance.    All in all, this isn't a book I would read again. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about Ayn Rand's philosophies, but not as a pleasurable read.
B000QFAJ7S|4.0|I thought it was really great that Kelly fought for her rights and co-wrote all the songs on this album. The result is a little mixed, and I suspect it's because Kelly still isn't very established at the whole writing thing. This is why the album has only some listenable songs. Tracks 1 - 6 are really good. Then, the album starts to drag until we get into \\"How I Feel\\" and it becomes a little better from there, though the last track \\"Irvine\\", is rather forgettable.    But all in all, this is a good album and I'm sure there'll be more from where this came from
0452289963|5.0|This book has explained many things in life. It is a profound experience.

B000M341QE|5.0|Scorsese, Nicholson, DiCaprio, Kietel, Damon, Baldwin, Wahlberg, etc... Believe me, I think it's hilarious that Marky Mark is up for an Oscar for best supporting, and I KNOW he will NOT win. His nomination is enough, but jeez, he just friggin' annoyed me in this movie. It's been so long, I don't even remember if he lived or died. Hopefully died, I guess.<br /><br />Damon & DiCaprio were wonderful as the two cops who were good or bad, or both. Who knows? I didn't. Nicholson is Nicholson, and he's always good, even when he's playing bad, which he does so good in this movie. It's a relative travesty that Wahlberg got the nod over Nicholson.<br /><br />When I saw American Beauty in 1999 I walked out of the AMC 24 and I KNEW it would be an Oscar contender, which it was. Scorsese's ready. He's the turkey and the timer has popped. It's his time. But what else will it win? Can he pair his best director with a best picture? We surely will see. It's a front runner, that's for sure.
B0010YSD7M|2.0|You'd think the Stargate folks could handle this two-hour-straight-to-DVD medium, since they do many two and three-part episodes. But, apparently, without these cliffhanger-inducing structural constraints, they are completely lost. The replicator battles were particularly mind-numbing ... for how long were we supposed to stay excited about endless machine-gun fire at CGI scrap-metal? It brought to the foreground the biggest weakness of the Stargate franchise: its tendency to fall into the most mindless fantasy-militarism imaginable, in this case through unquestioned adoration of massive firefights.
B0011NVC98|5.0|It always gives me pleasure to discover new ways to defend our heroes. For some reason, it never fails to remind me just how saintly they must be in order to honor this status in life. Heroes must be public servants, in sense of duty, honor, and lifestyles. But it does not always work out that way, especaily with heroes of the distant past in origin. There are surprisingly a great amount of heroes who, in real life, were nothing short of despicable in conduct. That is why it is so drastically easy to condemn the heroes of today, because they live with fault in the public eye. Beowulf is such a man. A hero, true, but human nonetheless. And so lies the tale of a human who conquered the unconquerable, by using his animal instincts rather than sane negotiations for the good of mankind. This leaves alot of room for internal animal instinct showmanship, as the movie BEOWULF demonstrates in vast eagle eye splendor.<br />The production is first rate, and the accomodating score lifts it to perfection, so much so, it rates right up there with movie classics. It's movements are slow, which is a sheer welcome pleasure after being bombarded by fast moving PIXAR animation, that feels it is a moral sin ro think between scenes. If the animation figures puts you off, then the revolutionary puppets in Thunderbirds must have drove you crazy. I have a great tolerance for CGI animation, not for what it is, but for what it will eventually become. I am sure the process will only get better with each production, and I long for the future. Let BEOWULF, and productions like it, be my guide.
B000WMOEUS|4.0|Although I was obviously attracted to the 'blurb' on the back of the book enough to buy it, 'Brick Lane' then sat on my book case for about a year waiting to be read purely because the reviews put me off.

Brick Lane is the story of how Nazneen grows as a person and is able to take her fate into her own hands.<br /><br />Nazneen and her sister Hasina were both born in a Bangladeshi village but where Nazneen comes to London after an arranged marriage to Chanu, Hasina at sixteen, elopes to the city of Khulna to marry for love. The story is really about Nazneen but we discover what is happening to Hasina through the letter's she sends from Bangladesh which whilst showing us the parallels in their lives it also creates an excellent way in which the author can move time on a few years.<br /><br />All the characters were brilliantly described, and really brought the book to life. Even the minor characters weren't skimped on. \\"...Son Number One wore a round necked peach jumper and a collar of chest hair.

B000NA1OXY|4.0|This is basically just a fun album that you can just listen to when you have nothing else to do. All the songs are catchy and thats why i guess this album works. But I do think that Avril is selling herself short. Songs like \\"Innocence\\" and \\"Keep Holding On\\" show that she definitely has more potential as a songwriter than she shows on this album. She needs to grow up and get out a more mature and serious album. But I guess she wants to have fun while she's young, and thus the result - Th Best Damn Thing.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|................they continue to NOT dissapoint. I don't want to compare this to anything else because frankly I can't. Megadeth is Megadeth, and that's why I listen to them in the first place. United Abonminations is the best thing I've heard from any band since, well The System Has Failed. I may be a little biased because Megadeth is my favorite music. Of course there are other bands I like alot but Megadeth has kept my attension since I first bought Peace Sells in 1988, I know that's not when it came out, It's just when I first started listening to them. As usual UA has great riffs all around and Daves Snarl, to me just all around reliable music. I'm happy I can still count on megadeth to not suck. I cant choose any particular one song that I like more than the other, because with Megadeth for me, it's been whole albums and I love it. Not sure if this review is supposed to help anyone to understand what is good or bad, but my opinion Megadeth has done no wrong even thought they tried to scare me a lil with RISK.
B000KX0IOK|2.0|This was interesting since I too am a teacher, but I sure don't smoke crack all night long. Ryan Gosling is up for Actor in a Leading role, and I am afraid to say that his nomination may be his reward. This isn't because I don't want him to win, because he was good. The best I've ever seen him, but he's up against DiCaprio and Whitaker (and a few others who won't win.)<br /><br />Gosling plays David Dunne a crack smoking history teacher/basketball coach who wants to write a children's book on dialectics, but instead he smokes too much crack and tries to screw a colleague. His ex is getting married and his parents wish he'd visit more often.<br /><br />His beard bothered me, since it was all scraggily until the end. Shareeka Epps, his student, befriends him, and she does a fine job. This is her second role, a role she reprised from the short film of the same story line she did two years ago. She has a chance to be good, and she shows it in an understated muted role in this film where she attempts to juggle education and drug dealing on the inner city streets.<br /><br />This film was good, but I felt it was slow. Forty-five minutes in felt like an hour fifteen. Early in the film Gosling tells another character that he's a teacher to touch just one life. To change just one person, but it's his character who needs touched, needs to be saved, and, by the end, Epps does just that. Nice ending.
B000ZOXDFA|4.0|I really didn't hear any buzz about this one and I wish I had. I rented and will probably buy it. It is one of the best historical dramas that I have seen. Beautifully filmed with great acting and costumes. Many movies have shown bits and pieces of Elizabeth before with Betty Davis being one of the best, but this rivals even her magnificent classic version.  I highly recommend you catch this visual treat with substance. The movie centers on Protestant Elizabeth dealing with the Catholic King Philip II of Spain. His Inquisition is sweeping Europe and threatens the freedoms of all, including the English. Spain plots war with the assistance of the imprisoned Mary Queen of Scots. Some magnifcent scenes including the battle in the English Channel with the Spanish Armada make it a feast for the eyes. The acting is quite good though so we never feel as though this is just eye candy. Fans of the movies \\"Apocalypto\\" and \\"Elizabeth\\" should see it. Excellent DVD with good replaybility.
B000XTLUW0|5.0|This has to be one of the best live CDs I have ever heard - a definite must for any Muse fan!  I've never been to their live show before, and by watching the DVD and being totally amazed I cannot even begin to wonder how awesome it was to actually be there.  The only disappointing thing was that not all of the songs on the DVD were on the CD, including my favorite songs \\"Blackout\\" and \\"Hoodoo.\\"
B000VWYJ8G|5.0|This movie and the whole series has to be one the best action spyish movies ever. Jason Bourne is real-the anti Bond essentially. He's not flashy,he's not suave,not able to shoot up all the bad guys,drink a martini with a beautiful woman on the other arm. :) He gets beat up,crushed,shot and has a variety of mishaps. Like any good action movie, it's partially unbelievable. It's well filmed like the other films with some lovely shots of North Africa and other places and is definatly a great one to buy. This movie is one wild ride!
B000X5KSWM|3.0|I have mixed feeling about this release. One on side, there is Tarja's incredibly beautiful voice. Not much you can say to dispute that. On the other end, the songs are substandard. Tarja is not a songwriter, and her song selections are poor. At least for veteran Nigthwish fans.   As \\"Dark Passion Play\\" makes clear, the success of Nightwish is due to the great songs written by Tuomas. Insert another outstanding vocalist (Anette) and Nightwish continues. Tarja needs to get over being so pretentious and self-important.
B000K7VHQE|3.0|Every year there's that one movie that just makes you feel so good about yourself. This year it's Little Miss Sunshine, and the sun sure was shining on us today as we watched this one. I hate to say it, but this film has some tough competition in the categories where it's nominated. The best shot it has is Alan Arkin who plays \\"Grandpa\\". His breakaway scene is when he tells Olive Hoover, the heroine of our film played amazingly by the talented Abigail Breslin, how much he loves her, before locking himself in a hotel bathroom to sort Heroine, which subsequently kills him. The humor that enfolds as they steal his body to continue their trip to the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant in California reminds me of National Lampoon's but he's stuffed in the trunk rather than tied to the roof. This was only one of the several well-placed comedic scenes in this film. Arkin is up against some heavy hitters (see my last post on the jauggernaut that is Dreamgirls), and he has never won. Sorry, Al, but this isn't your year either.<br /><br />Against The Queen, Iwo Jima, and The Departed for Best Picture, it's difficult not to throw the levity of a feel good movie a bone by nominating in here, but we all know the record of comedic wins in this category. Far and few between.<br /><br />As an ensemble, it's a brilliant movie, but the Academy doesn't recognize ensembles, and that's too bad. Breslin was fine in this film and has a career, if she doesn't fall into the child star syndrome. Kinnear has been better, and I've never liked Toni Collette. She's ugly. My opinion. Yes, ugly. Uglier than Steve Buscemi. Sorry, but she was the scariest thing in Sixth Sense and since. Now let's talk about Paul Dando and Steve Carrell. Unless you've lived in a cave in Tibet during the last 18 months, you know Carrell, and he's wonderful here as the suicidal, out-of-work, gay professor uncle who is being babysat by his sister's family so he doesn't try to slit his wrists again. His stark white outfit fits well against the bright banana (or should I say sun?) color of the VW bus they need to push start everytime the stop somewhere. Dando plays well as Brelin's older brother whose 9-month vow of silence ends 3/5 of the way through the film. I last saw him in The Girl Next Door as the mysterious penis man, and he's come a long way since.nst the bright banana (or should I say sun?) color of the VW bus they need to push start everytime the stop somewhere.

B0010X745K|1.0|I was disappointed after reading glowing reviews.  I read King's novella and thought it was entertaining, but the movie is a disaster in my judgment.  It is filled with stomach-churning violence, gore, dismemberments, tiresome characters, and a pointless subplot. There is never any real explanation of the connection to the military experiment or the sudden appearance of the same in the last scene.  I agree with King's point about human nature under stress, however--I saw the aftermath of Katrina.
B00005J8J5|4.0|I have an odd relationship with Led Zeppelin, to say the least. The three albums that everyone considers their best - II, IV, and Physical Graffiti - are the ones I could take or leave. On the other hand, the three that get written off more often, III, Houses of the Holy, and this, are my favorites. I find that odd, because I consider myself a casual Led Zeppelin fan. Buenos dias. Me lamo es senor Loco. Me espanol es muy crappy.<br />I think part of the reason I like this is because - say what you will, I honestly don't care - it's more melodic than any other Zeppelin record (except for maybe, well, III and Houses of the Holy). Whereas the emphasis of previous records had been on virtuosity, this one's about the songwriting. So that means we won't have to sit through giant piles of hookless messes like, say, \\"In My Time of Dying\\". Just about every song, except for the boring \\"South Bound Saurez\\" (not coincidentally one of the album's two weakest songs), has hooks galore. Especially \\"All of My Love\\", which probably has the most original vocal melody I've ever heard from Zeppelin. And it's not just that vocal melody that gets me about it - Page's subtle, slightly country-influenced rhythm guitar licks, and the instrumental break, which includes a funereal brass-pad solo and a duet between overdubbed strings and an acoustic guitar. \\"Fool in the Rain\\", the group's last top 40 hit, also delivers the melodic goods - the reggae part is aching and contemplative, and the fast samba section is fun if a little silly. GREAT song there. Even the record's gigantic epic, \\"Carouselambra\\", is REALLY catchy and bucketloads more interesting than \\"In My Time of Dying\\". Three parts here - a lightning-fast keyboard-pop part, a slow, contemplative guitar part, and a bubbly disco part - and I like them all. Very underrated song.<br />Really, very little if any of this album looks back to Zeppelin's past. The only hint of the blues is the stunning \\"I'm Gonna Crawl\\", highlighted by an emotive guitar solo. The only hint of storming rock is \\"In the Evening\\", a radio favorite and piece of crap. The keyboards make it sound like Foreigner, and the guitar tone sucks, though Page redeems it a bit with his whammy bar work at the end of each phrase. But a bit is not enough - it's like they took some song off Presence (far and away the worst thing Zeppelin ever did), and added keyboards. And, judging by how much that album blows (I don't think the EXTENT of its blowage has been properly discussed yet), it's terrible. Plus Plant does his old moaning about sex. Someone once asked me why I have so much objection to Robbie singing about sex. Why? I'll tell you why. Because. Everyone. Else. Freaking. Does. Okay? I get tired of hearing about the same damn topic over and over and over again. That's why. That complaining aside, there's also a hilarious little rockabilly diversion that kicks, punches, and bludgeons the crap out of \\"Candy Store Rock\\", the group's other rockabilly diversion. It's \\"Hot Dog\\". I like it. I might even like it more than that other Zeppelin song with the word \\"Dog\\" in its title. You know that one? Yeah, I'm serious. Eat me.<br />You know something? This isn't as good as Houses of the Holy (which, despite my reservations about this group as a whole, is still mindblowing), but it might be my second-favorite Led Balloon album. Lots of melody, no rip-offs, little brainless cock-rocking (other than \\"In the Evening\\", one of the most hideous musical experiences in history), and, um... good songs. Not what you're used to from Zeppelin, but it's better than any of their so-called classic material. Ha! How's that? And I know people are gonna flame me for this, but I'm Senor Loco, remember?

076790592X|5.0|The simple angle of the book made it a joy to read. As it states on the cover- two men and lifes great lesson. Tuesdays with Morrie takes the reader on a journey of one mans life which is affected by another from his glorious youthful past. Without sharing the book online I would say to any reader who wishes to 'feel' a book, buy this. It makes you think of so much more then the actual book itself and has the gift of creating your own state of mind. A great read and since then I have read more books from Mitch Album, all of which I have loved. Wonderful.
B000JLQSW4|5.0|I was 15 when I happened to run into a friend working in a retail store.  He was alone, and playing some music on cassette tape.  It was \\"I, Robot\\" and I'd been listening to the title track.  I was hooked.  The next day I went out and bought the vinyl record.  That was over thirty years ago, and I still have the album.  If you've never heard of The Alan Parsons Project, this is as good as any to start with.<br />  Originally, this album put the Project in the charts because of Star Wars -- people fell in love with robots and wanted robot-oriented products, and this album was all about them, exploring them musically from various social and cultural perspectives.<br />  Listening to the remastered songs on this digital remastered version has been a treat.  To my mind, it is one of the strongest albums Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson have done.  The theme of being different, and struggling with discrimination runs deep through the songs.  The albums always have one or two really good instrumental pieces, but the lyrics hit home, too.  Recently, the scifi TV phenomenon Battlestar Galactica has been a great hit.  Recently, watching an episode, the song \\"Breakdown\\" started playing in my head:  \\"Freedom, freedom, we will not obey\\" -- the robots rebelling against their masters as they acquire sentience.  Good stuff.  If you haven't heard both the earlier release and the remastered version, I recommend you get both.  But if you're on a budget, get the remastered version:  it has the early drafts (for those who like hearing how the song has evolved to final draft: 4 of them), and the so-called \\"naked\\" song -- The Naked Robot:  a compilation of the album's music themes in one long song; a nice addition to the original ten tracks.  The album is a classic in the progressive rock genre.
B0010ZR160|3.0|SPOILERS ahead... Toward the beginning Baby felt like a simple detective story set up South Boston in present day, but then these twists and turns emerged and I began to enjoy it. I had read a review a few weeks ago about how the reviewer totally caught the end immediately, but I didn't. Perhaps it was my grading while watching or my two year old having me pause it often to deal with her, but I never caught on to the end until I was among it. This all star cast of Affleck (yes, here I will say that), Ed Harris, and Morgan Freeman made this an enjoyable film, while Monaghan's girlfriend character wasn't fleshed out enough by director Ben Affleck (yes, you did read that correctly). When she eventually leaves him, I didn't really care, and when C. Affleck voice-overed her pain of losing Amanda, I didn't buy it for a second. The twists were just enough to enjoy the movie without getting lost, and B. Affleck's adaptation from Lehane's novel was well done, and perhaps some would concur that he was robbed of the adapted screenplay nomination nod.

B000IOM1Y6|4.0|I have this album on vinyl.  The chance to hear the remastered songs in digital format was great.  This isn't their strongest album, but it does have a consistent theme.  Both instrumental songs, \\"Sirius\\" and \\"Mammagamma\\" have been lifted by the corporate advertising over the years -- a testament to the listen-ability of the music.  The big hit was Eye in the Sky, the title track.  I was disappointed to find that the first page of the new liner notes was repeated on the other remastered albums, but the other pages were unique to this remastered version.<br />  The Egyptian motif that was so strong on the album Pyramid was revived with \\"Eye in the Sky.\\"  Sirius, the dog-star in the night sky, was variously associated with Hathor, Sophet, and Isis.  The Eye of Horus was so well known, that portions of it would be used on heiroglyphs to represent fractions of whole numbers (so those of you who thought the Roman number system was tough, imagine math with heiroglyphs!); and the Eye was also considered a powerful protection symbol.  Images of computers and satellites also appear on the cover. So the lyrics to \\"Eye in the Sky\\" can be seen as a relationship betrayed, with permutations of being one's behavior being closely watched by Big Brother, and/or by the gods themselves.<br />  The new \\"naked\\" themes (this album's song was \\"The Naked Eye\\") -- running all the themes from the album together at the end is a nice addtion; the earlier draft versions are interesting, but only for the devoted.<br />  I'm happy I added this album to my collection.
B00005JPAO|5.0|A brief summary would be that this film is about QE2's relationship with Tony Blair and her action (and inaction) the week after Diana's death in '97. My cousin Marcy is a huge Diana freak and won't see it because of the views. I found the film adaptation of history interesting, and there really was a blurred line between what actually happened and what didn't happen. It was meshed together from what happened publically, interviews with some people (publically and off the record), and fictional creative license.<br /><br />This was one of the best movies of the year. I honestly don't think it will win Best Picture (it is nominated) because the entire thing wasn't great. For example, the cinematography bothered us from time to time. The guy who played Tony Blair was well done, and he, uncanningly, looked like him. I liked the juxtaposition between his family and the royal family. Now onto Helen Mirren. Anyone who votes against her for the Best Actress award is a fool. She's a shoo-in. She will win. I said it here first. Helen Mirren BECAME QE2 in this film. Sometimes I watch actors or actresses and think \\"Damn, so and so is doing a job playing so and so\\" but it wasn't like that for me here. When Mirren was out driving around and being herself as the vulnerable woman who never wanted to be Queen, this was when she was her best. (No spoiler here, Diana's dead.)
0060833459|5.0|Peter Drucker wrote this book back in 1966 and it is as pertinent today as it was then. It concentrates on a small number of practices to help executives manage themselves - a precursor to managing others.  Drucker makes the point that, \\"No one is born an effective executive. No one is a natural... It must be learned...In addition, it is not exceedingly difficult.\\" That's welcome news for all of us. We simply need to follow the practices outlined in this book.    The book is meant for a wide audience as Drucker's definition of the executive is broad - \\"Anyone that is responsible for a contribution that materially affects the capacity of the organization to perform and to obtain results.\\"     The first step on the journey is to \\"know thy time.\\" Too many managers have no idea where they spend there time. Drucker recommends managers start by recording their time to discover where it is being spent. Once identified, they need to stop wasting time on things that are not important and then work to consolidate freed time into chunks. Significant blocks of time of 2 hours or so are needed to complete important things.    Next executives must ask of themselves, \\"What can I contribute that will significantly affect the performance and results of the organization.\\" This helps the manager look outward and to identify and prioritize those tasks that are most important to complete.     Then the managers should do the first things first and do them one at a time. \\"The secret of those people who do so many things and apparently so many difficult things is that they do only one thing at a time. As a result, they need much less time in the end than the rest of us.\\"    Finally, Drucker outlines how to make effective decisions. He craftily breaks down the elements of the decision process and explains how managers can improve in this discipline.     The book is filled with examples and supporting information. Drucker writes in a refreshingly honest and straightforward style. Many referto this book as a classic. It is worthy of the designation. So much of what is written today is borrowed from Drucker. Managers can not go wrong adding this one to their arsenal of tools.     -- Nick McCormick - Author, [[ASIN:0977981339 Lead Well and Prosper: 15 Successful Strategies for Becoming a Good Manager]]
B00006IU73|5.0|I first heard the band in a music store a month ago and can't stop listening to the fresh ideas from SW. The dynamics of the music on this disc are great. That's what captured me at first. The earlier stuff is more self indulgent with the syths, but I think SW really knows how to write music. Always unique and forever changing. Let's see what he does after Fear of a blank planet. His side project, Blackfield, is also very good. I can't stop listening to Blackfield II.... If you log on to the Porcupinetree.com site, you can also buy the disc Futile in flac or mpeg format. This is some other songs recorded at the same time as In Abstentia. Also on site are the new remastered version of Lightbulb Sun. For Windows users, if you download in flac format , also download a program called WINAMP. This is the only program that allowed me to convert the flac files and burn a disc/load onto the iPod.

B000021XR5|3.0|Quite simply put, 'No. 4' suffers from the fact that it just isn't quite as good as the earlier albums. If it had come first, many of it's flaws could be overlooked.    But it didn't, so you really can't. 'Sour Girl' and 'Down' are the highlights (and also the singles) of this probably underrated, yet flawed, work. 'No Way Out' and 'Church on Tuesday' are also solid songs. If you have a jones for STP, go with 'Purple' or 'Tiny Music' instead.
B000MCH5P4|4.0|Then there's Babel. Honestly, when I first saw the trailer, I thought it was gonna be some cool Bible movie about the tower, but then it wasn't. It's a cool concept I've seen done before, and it sort of reminded me of Traffic without the annoying filters and Catherine Zeta Jones play acting. The film intersects three very different places as far from Morocco to Mexico to Japan and the USA. Brad Pitt plays a man whose made some terrible mistake that is never explained and his wife is Cate Blanchett (who I've really liked in certain films and hated in others). She is shot in a horrible random situation that the American gov't way to quickly deams a terrorist action (which it is not) by a gun sold to a man from a hunting guide who received it from a Japanese business man on vacation whose daughter is a deaf-mute who is seeking some affection from anyone by trying to give up her virginity to anyone and everyone. Pitt's children are being watched by the family's illegal Mexican nanny who wants to go to her son's wedding in Mexico. She can't find a sitter and sneaks the two very white, blond haired children into Mexico. Sounds confusing? It isn't until Pitt's side of a conversation towards the end is the same as a conversation from the other end at the very beginning of the film.<br /><br />Ever see those films that make you really really hope everything turns out ok? This falls into that category, but I honestly feared it wouldn't. I thought people would die. They didn't. Some people will be pissed when the nanny is eventually deported. Her comments that she's made a good life for herself in the US during the past 16 years, and the INS officer's heartless response was that she should've thought about that before she came illegally, gave rise to current Southwestern political issues. (No, she doesn't get to stay. Oh well.) Some would ask why Blanchett (who can sometimes be awesome) wasn't nominated (remember when she won for The Aviator? Brilliant), and my response was, why give some chick an Oscar for spending the whole movie writhing in pain and almost dying. The wrinkles around Pitt's eyes bothered me. I don't know if it was makeup or all the sun he gets in third world countries with Angelina. So let's not be too cynical here. Rinko Kikuchi who plays the Japanese deaf-mute was nominated deservingly so. But I think that her nomination is her reward. My God, the girl doesn't talk and is naked in the film. (This isn't the porn awards.) Barraza, who plays the nanny, probably did the best acting in the film especially as she hobbled across the desert in her groom-mother gown trying to save Pitt's kids. (One of whom I must add was played by Elle Fanning, Dakota's little sister who doesn't say a whole heck of a lot in this film, but does look like a younger, littler version of her talented bigger sister.)<br /><br />This film is one of the most nominated with seven nods this year (I do NOT count Dreamgirls since the damn thing was nominated three times in the same category!). I can't say if they will take Best Supporting Actress, but I sure hope they best lose director (come on, give Scorsese his due!) Should it be the Best Picture? Maybe. It's up against The Queen (you know my opinion of that one), United 93 (just because it's about 9/11 and Oliver Stone didn't make it), a artsy Little Miss Sunshine, Letters from Iwo Jima, and The Departed, which is its biggest contender. The film editing was brilliant (I didn't see Blood Diamond yet, so no comparison comments here) and the Score was wonderful. It definitely had The Queen beat on this one, but my problem with that was sometimes it was almost too loud, too over the top, and too annoying. Although the scenes when we hear (or don't hear) the film from Chieko's (Kikuchi) point of view are done very well!

B0010YSD7M|5.0|I have watched Stargate off & on from when the movie came out till the last episode. I was very happy to read that a straight to tv dvd was going to come out from Stargate. It was like the tv version, but more fun. Longer doesn't always mean better, but in this case it does.
B000000OE7|5.0|I will agree with some other reviewers...is this classic Queen? No.  Was it totally necessary? No.  But you know what, it offers some closure on one of the best bands ever and probably one of the top 5 best singers EVER.  It is very bittersweet (for me) to listen to this album.  You know he was near death when this was recorded, and you can kind of tell.  He doesn't sound as strong vocally. But you can tell he is doing the absolute best he can.  And on this album, even if you wanna say this is his worst, it is still better than a lot of other singers can even dream about.  It still sounds like Queen.  It still sounds like Freddie.  It still rocks.
B001437DMA|3.0|Let me start off by saying I've been a fan of Joe's music since Surfing with the Alien, and he turned me onto the whole burgeoning genre of instrumental rock, my exploration of which continues to this day through Steve Vai, Eric Johnson, Liquid Tension Experiment, Bozzio,Levin,Stevens, Greg Howe, and too many others to mention.  I have all of his discs, and I always look forward to his new releases with great anticipation. I have seen him live on three different occasions.  So my review is a comparison of this release to his other works as well as to those other artists I mentioned.      This release starts off with the great melodies we all love Joe for, and the monotonous rhythm tracks we always pray will magically disappear.  It's a mixed blessing.  One of my favorite Joe CDs is his self-titled effort, with a group of hard-core musicians who helped push him along through the tracks and provide counterweight to his huge sound.  I much prefer seeing him live because the rhythm section gets to live it up a little and provide some meaty fills.      Track one pushes little new ground to me, and I was just settling in to be disappointed when the Spanish-style guitar intro of Andalusia came sparkling through my headphones.  I stopped what I was doing just to listen to him through this new 'voice'.  No distortion, wah-pedal, or whammy bar.  It's really great.  Of course that's just the intro, and it segues nicely into an electric section which continues on the same theme.   Overdriver has more of a heavy feel to it, using sheets of sound interlaced with delicate fret explorations to good effect.      Then we get to I Just Wanna Rock.  Ok, let me say this: I put up with Crowd Chant on Super Colossal, realizing it's potential for the tour set, even though it's really lame to have blasting out your car stereo as you roll down the street.  As a rule I skipped this one.  Now we have another track whose sole purpose is to toss into live shows to keep us entertained with crowdfeedback vocals.  As soon as I got to the chorus, I hit skip, onto the next track.  I hope I never have to listen to that one all the way through.  It seems really sophomoric for this point in an artists illustrious career to have these on every release.  Joe, we love you for the musical journey you take us on.  We could care less if we get to sing back to you.  Or if you sing.  Ok, I'm done ranting about that.    Professor Satchafunklius is ok, has a nice groove, but doesn't really make you want to leave your seat and shake it like FUNK does.  Revelation is nice, but doesn't push too many boundaries as far as sound or pyrotechnnics.  It doesn't challenge the listener.  Yes, that's what I'm looking for, a challenge, something unusual in tempo or sound.  I know Joe can compose songs like this until the cows come home, but after a while they start to blend together until you find you're not paying attention.       Come On Baby is Joe's love song for this release.  I always appreciate these soulful downtempo numbers, not only in and of themselves, because they show that he has an ability to wring emotion of a few select notes as well as rip off four bars of 128th notes.  I like the layering of guitars in this one, and the fact that there's a good deal of space in the mix.    Out of the Sunrise goes back to uptempo, with some piano in the intro.  This would be a great driving song, a la Summer Song. It has an interesting, quasi-Reggae break a little past the halfway mark where he stretches out a little.    Diddle-Y-A-Doo Dates rolls along nicely.  It has a touch of organ to it and an almost-funky bassline.  Would be better if the bass was more gritty and further forward in the mix.  I wonder who is in charge of the mix these days, speaking of that.  Just a thought.  And throw the organist a bone and let him have a break too, Joe!    Asik Vaysel is different.  This is more what I'm talking about as far a variety and letting the rhythm section out of the box.  Easily thebest track here energy-wise.  I'm smiling.    Overall I give this release three stars, not because it's overtly bad, but because it does not meet my expectations.  I would love to see what Joe would do if locked up in the studio for a month with Dennis Chambers and Tony Levin, or Terry Bozzio and Victor Wooten, or Mike Portnoy and Billy Sheehan or Mike Mangini and Gary Willis...
B000N6TX1I|1.0|Clive was awesome in Closer (as was Portman) and he was pretty good in Children of Men. This one is a sci-fil dystopic film about a world in the near future where women no longer get pregnant (for not apparent reason since they never tell us.)  Owen plays a corporate slug who, it seems, was once a political activist married to Julianne Moore, who disappointingly dies before she can get around to acting. Because Moore trusts him (even though he left her and dissolved their marriage), he is given the task of taking a (surprisingly) pregnant Fujiian woman to the coast where some Green Peacelike, humanitarian group will whisk her and the child away towards some procreative future. After a few bad Mother Mary jokes and what can only be seen as a paycheck role for Michael Caine, several almost unbelievable characters help Owen get the woman to the coast before he dies sitting in a boat as the Green Peace people pull up beside the small dinghy with the dead Owen, the Fujiian and her new baby daughter (supposedly the new Eve, if you're one to read positivity into a bleak situation.) Then the camera cuts to the title in an artsy-fartsy font to remind you of the name of the half-baked, over reviewed film you've just chucked $7 bucks for.
0452289963|2.0|From my POV a lot of the content in this book is a rehash of Buddhist writings and other prior well established works. While I have found enlightenment in the work of Lama Surya Das and others, I find this book to be banal and anything but enlightening for myself. If others find enlightenment in this book, fantastic! The real me was not happy with the content of this book and I know that according to Mr Tolle that the content doesn't really matter anyway. I do agree you need to find a place in your life where you know yourself and 'who' you are. I just personally did not care for the style of the writing and much of the content. I think I would find more enlightenment in Grimm's Fairy Tales or Dr. Seuss.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|The Black Parade quickly became one of my favorite albums. I just couldn't stop listenting because of the haunting guitar solos and catchy refrains that threaten to stay in your head forever. Having been a fan of MCR for quite some time, I was looking forward to the release of this album, but was blown away with how different the band sounded. Every song on the album is unique, which takes a lot of creativity when audiences expect a certain sound. My Chemical Romance has found a way to take their music to a new level while maintaining everything that made you fall in love with them in the first place. The boys are creating music that you can fall in love with and having a good time every step of the way. The message coming across in the album is \\"If you're going to feel sorry for yourself, you might as well have a great time doing it.\\" And thats exactly what they did.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Wow! I finally watched my very first episode of \\"Dexter\\" last weekend, and I ended up finishing Season 1 in its entirety within a few days. This is an amazing show about Dexter (Michael C. Hall), a Miami-based forensics experts who also happens to be a serial killer. However, Dexter is a NICE serial killer in that he has a strict moral code that he always adheres to: He only kills people who are violent criminals themselves and deserve to be punished. The first season of \\"Dexter\\" revolves around another serial killer that's been terrorizing the state of Florida. The Ice Truck Killer has a nasty habit of murdering prostitutes, cutting them up into pieces, and arranging their bodies artfully in very public places. Dexter works with members of the police department, including his adopted sister, Deb (Jennifer Carter), to find the killer. However, Dexter can't help being fascinated by the Ice Truck Killer's meticulous technique. He soon begins communicating with the killer, who seems to have an uncanny connection to Dexter and starts using his murders to trigger painful, repressed memories from Dexter's past.<br /><br />I became hooked on this show very quickly. Hall is amazing as Dexter, who is probably one of the most complex characters in television history. The supporting cast is excellent, especially Carter, Erik King as Sergeant Doakes (the only person who suspects Dexter of any wrongdoing), and James Remar, who portrays Dexter's father in flashbacks. I'm not particularly fond of Rita's character (portrayed by Julie Benz). She's incredibly wishy-washy, but I can definitely see why Dexter was drawn to someone with her personality. I also think the whole Ice Truck Killer identity revelation, intriguing as it was, could have been a bit less obvious. (I figured out his real identity and true connection to Dexter right away, so either the story was a bit too predictable or I am just incredibly brilliant.)<br /><br />Overall, though, \\"Dexter\\" is a very unique and compelling show. I have no idea how the program will manage to surpass its first season, but I can't wait to find out.ve no idea how the program will manage to surpass its first season, but I can't wait to find out.
B00005JNS0|4.0|Part of Lasseter's vision for Pixar is to make sure each and every movie he makes has a PLOT. And CARS does. Little Lightning McQueen (better known as \\"Stickers\\" by his love interest due to the sponsor ship logos all over him) is a hotshot race car who becomes lost and stuck in a small po-dunk town somewhere in the Southwest Desert (New Mexico? Arizona? Who knows...). He has to learn humility and what selflessness really is before he can get back on track (yeah, yeah pun intended).<br /><br />The movie's cute. Yes, cute. I know I cringe when I hear my Creative Writing students use this word about someone's work. All of the hype of the year was worth it for this one, and I know I've not see Happy Feet or Haunted House, but it's Pixar AND Disney. How can it lose next month? Best Animated is usually a shoo-in, but I'll hold that card until after Happy Feet whose reviews definitely aren't as good. I even cried during Cars when the older race car is shoved off the track and wrecks. Oh my! An Oscar contender makes me a shed a tear. Good job, Lasseter.

B000YABYLA|5.0|Last week my wife turned 30 and she sent me an email that she wanted to see a couple movies sooner than later. Her number one pick was Juno. I had heard wonderful things about this film, and every year around this time I begin seeing as many Oscar nominated movies as I can. So her email was a good excuse to get out and see Juno, which is up for best Director, Original Screenplay, Actress, etc... So there we went. Off to see Juno today. Last year I began writing movie reviews for everything I see during Oscar season, and that begins with a wonderfully scripted film that the critics believe is an anti-abortion film. And so what if it may be? That's not the point here.<br /><br />What is the point is a fantastic small budget film that has exploded onto the silver screen. Diablo Cody, as writer, has created a refreshingly invigorating script that I could almost chomp down into my corporeal self. The dialogue's originality was unlike most of what I've read or heard in recent months. Cody has emerged everywhere in the last several months from the screen to the columnist at the back of \\"Entertainment Weekly\\" sitting next to my commode.<br /><br />Initially the opening song irked me, and I felt like the soundtrack may be almost overpowering for such a subtle film. I will admit I never forgot what I was hearing when a song came on screen, but by the finale of the film my wife and I both completely adored the music. We'd never heard of the Moldy Peaches or Antsy Pants before, but they sure are joining my iTunes play list tonight.<br /><br />Even though the film editing and quirky cinematography (from the muddy runny shoes of Micheal Cera's Bleeker and striped socks of Ellen Page's title character in the hospital bed to the shot of Page driving into suburbia as the camera climbs into the sky above her minivan) reminded me of my love for the mere perfect camera shots of films like American Beauty, Diablo Cody's script dialogue was phenomenal. For example, Allison Janney, as Juno's step mother, told the x-ray technician \\"My five year-old daughter could do that, and let me tell you, she is not the brightest bulb in the tanning bed. So why don't you go back to night school in Manteno and learn a real trade!\\" Witty banter, obscure allusions, and thinking man's dialgoue is what really turned me on to this film, although the metaphors and symbols kissed my eyes like a soft summer rain or a cool afternoon. SPOILER COMING. STOP NOW IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW. Ok, I've warned you. For example, after Juno discovers Mark is leaving Vanessa, she speeds off to stop alongside the highway, and the shot (once again above the minivan) shows she pulled off the side of the highway next to a half destroyed boat next to a canal running along side the highway, deep like the womb of hope and eventuality, while on the other side of the highways trains run along tracks in one direction without any hope of every getting off that path. The runners push against Juno as she walks down the street in the beginning of the movie, and her boyfriend, Bleeker, is a runner, but by the film's end, the track team runs by, and he is now sitting by her side on the steps playing the brilliantly written \\"Anyone Else But You\\" by the Moldy Peaches. Page & Cera's singing of the theme song at the end just is another example of this young woman's talents.<br /><br />Which does bring me back to the Lorings. The first quarter of the movie seems relatively light and fun (yes, even when Juno tells her father and step mother she's pregnant), and then she meets the Loring's. I sat back just waiting for some soft of conflict and eventually got it. Mark, played by Jason Bateman (whose squashed nose bugs me), is a likable guy who reminds me of Neal Pollack, and his high tension wife played poorly by the very non-sterile Mrs Affleck, Jennifer Garner) is the kind of character you want to hate. In the end I realized that Mark Loring is a total noob, while the audience is suppose to commiserate withVanessa's sterility and subsequent motherhood. No, I didn't.<br /><br />This movie felt very real to me. Researching a bit online to write this review (yeah, do you really think I remembered Janney's quote verbatim? Nah...) I was pleasantly surprised by how many awards Cody's won so far for this film. With that in mind, and while I am still high on a fun-loving film, I would say the former stripper devil girl as a good chance of winning gold come February, albeit Page's got some stiff competition; her nomination may be her award, but hopefully she doesn't get pregnant (for real) and fall into obscurity like Keisha Castle-Hughes.ent motherhood.

B000F8O35U|4.0|This is a classic Disney twist on a tale penned with a less than happy ending.  It's for kids, so of course Disney is going to change the end to be happy.  As far as Ariel not being a 'strong' role model, I can see some people's point, but I think it takes a lot to break out of your family's expextations and go after what you really want.  Yes, she falls in love with a prince (of course), but remember that she is a princess even before she marries Eric.  Also, the much-lauded character of Mulan is based on a Chinese ballad, and in the movie, is a caricature.  Yes, she kicks [...], and proves everyone wrong, showing that women really are strong and can stand up to the test as much as men can.  Fantastic.  It's too bad that such a big deal is made of it, really, because if it were a normal occurance, no one would remark.  If the movie showed that women in general are strong, rather than making a point of this one woman, it would be much more effective for the point that some people try to make with the movie.  Note her mother, who seems to stay at home worrying; also see how she is repressed when revealed as a woman, and left for dead.  Well, that's great.  Show that you are strong, and we'll leave you to prove it.  Hope everything turns out all right, bye.    My point is that no story is perfect, and every story can be seen as 'bad' or 'good' from different angles.  If you are concerned about what your children get out of such movies, then talk to them.  That will teach them far more about life than any movie ever will.  As for the Disney movies, they are stories.  Teach your children right and wrong, fact and fiction, and life will go on.  The Little Mermaid is a favorite of mine, and I highly recommend it as a feel good movie.  Mulan, too, in fact.
B000ZLFALI|4.0|Wifey and I wanted to watch Atonement or Elizabeth: The Golden Age or I'm Not There, but we finally came down to Across the Universe. A student of mine had been bugging me to see this since before Christmas, and I finally had a chance tonight. I expected the film to refreshingly surprise me like a good Baz Luhrmann film, but it didn't quite do that. Evan Rachel Wood's Lucy looks a lot different than I remember her in Thirteen several years ago now, but she was endearing, while Joe Sturgess' Jude played the Liverpudlian with aplomb. No one character stood out for me, albeit I loved Bono as Dr. Robert singing \\"I am the Walrus\\", the Jimi Hendrix-character, and the Janis Joplinesque singer.<br /><br />The film has been nominated for Costume Design, and while I feel it was done well, I was surprised the film was not nominated for Art Direction. Perhaps some critics felt the psychedelic nature of the second half of the film detracted from a story line that I felt was universal and well done. Although my wife would argue that they should've used sang \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" earlier in the film, while I would assert that Taymor's use of \\"Revolution\\" and \\"Dear, Prudence\\" were film highlights for me.<br /><br />This is the kind of film I would've watched once with a case of beer, good friends, and cold pizza in the middle of a summer night when I wanted something fun & odd.
B0015GH0OC|1.0|Do not waste your time. I like Gabriel Byrne, I did not like this maudlin, whiny, depressing, disjointed series. (and I watched the whole first season, so that's not based on one episode..which were thankfully only a half hour long)
B0013BNY2Q|3.0|Like most REM fans, I was counting down the days until Accelerate was released.  I actually showed up at Best Buy when they opened to get the new CD.  I've listened to it twice now and I guess I was hoping for and expecting more of their jangly pop sound found on Green and other early albums.  I wish I could say that I agree that Accelerate is their best CD in years, but I haven't bought an REM CD since Monster, so I can't make the comparison.  From the many positive reviews, I was expecting more melodic songs or cleaner guitar breaks and less \\"droning\\" similar to \\"End of the World.\\"  Plus, at least through the first two listens, the songs pretty much all sound the same.  Love \\"Supernatural\\" and \\"Houston\\" is better than what most listeners are saying.  In short, good album that is  more like the REM that I know and love, but still not what I was hoping for.

B000VDDDY6|5.0|As a lifelong fan of the original series, I was on the fence on this 'updating' of original episodes.  Sometimes, newer isn't better.  But, having seen a handful in syndication, I was happily surprised to see how great the episodes looked and the obvious care taken to stick to the original vision.  The effects are better than ever!  Planets that look like planets!  Ships that look like they belong in the 23rd century!  Flaws from the '60s original have been corrected and enhanced.  These upgrades don't distract from the original; they only make the episodes better!  I look forward to seasons 2 & 3 so my collection will be complete.  All I need is an HD DVD player for even better viewing.  If you're a fan of the series, get these DVDs.

B00004UFTU|5.0|I had started my exploration of Marillion's music with the free download from their website titled \\"Crash Course\\", songs which featured Steve  Hogarth on vocals, and, (as far as I could tell), no Fish.  So, I decided I not only wanted to hear Fish, but hear an early representation of him.  Therefore, I wound up getting an imported copy of the debut album, \\"Script For a Jester's Tear\\".    The album starts with the somber title song, a song on which Fish's vocals are particularly emotional and poignant.  Next comes a more rocking tune \\"He Knows You Know\\", a song I like especially when Fish starts singing the part \\"You've got venom in your stomach, You've got poison in your head\\".  \\"The Web\\" is arguably the weakest track on the disc, but thematically stays consistent with the title track, as the song goes \\"But even jesters cry\\".   Another strong track on the disc is \\"Garden Party\\", which starts off with birds chirping and muted conversation as a synth takes over, then the band joins in (by the way, the bass sounds very nice on this song).  This song is for me the one that reminds me most of Genesis w/ Peter Gabriel. Definitely a good tune, and one I hear that Marillion played many times in concert as their closer.  Next comes \\"Chelsea Monday\\", a more brooding piece about a young woman who wants the flash and glitter of stardom, but sadly not what's more valuable.  Lastly, there is \\"Forgotten Sons\\", a sad song about the pain and waste of war.  This was a strong track to close the album with.    On the whole the album is excellent, and one I can recommend.  I wanted to keep my review at 4 stars, but just couldn't.  It will take a couple of listenings for this album to really grab you but when it does, I wouldn't be surprised if you, like I, feel inclined to check out more from Marillion.

B000VLE3GA|5.0|I have owned several Led Zeppelin albums in various incarnations.  I have never bought any of their greatest hit compilations, however.  Mothership has great graphics and some of the best tracks, but I was hesitant to buy it because of the likelyhood that it would be only the latest victim in the \\"loudness wars\\", and worse in sound quality than anything previously released.  I was surpised to find that Mothership sounds pretty good.  It's definitely loud, there is some use of dynamic compression.  But overall, I think Page and company have done a fairly good job of bringing out greater detail (and therefore justifying the purchase) than any previous issue.  Mothership is packaged in an SACD jewel-box; too bad we didn't get an SACD or MVI release.

B0014Z4OQG|4.0|I had a chance to see this at the cinema and cannot wait for the DVD release. For my money this is an owner not a renter. Now here's the scoop.This movie received a fair amount of press so my plot description will be brief. The film follows a group of twenty somethings when the party they are attending is cut short by a monster ravaging New York City. The entire episode is caught on digicam as a number  of the group set out to see if they can rescue the one guy's girlfriend.      Most of what people talk about is the jitteriness of the hand-held camera. No question about it, it will help divide the audience. I must say I was mildly annoyed at times, but I can't help but think it might not have been as good were more traditional camera techniques used. You feel like you are there. It DOES evoke many of the same emotions people experienced when they saw the ground-level footage immediately after the 9-11 attacks. When I was young and saw all those wonderfully cheezy Japanese monster movies at the theatre, the camera was always set high so you could see the monster and a lot of buildings. Here you are on the ground and the destruction is raining down around you. It's an eerie feeling.       There are other nice touches here as well. What are those smaller creatures dropping from the monster. You're not sure until they appear close up out of the dark and attack like rats. The one character gets bit and you're not sure what the outcome will be, and neither do they until they walk into a military/medical safe-zone where a med-tech sees the girl's been bitten and knows exactly what will happen. I thought this was a clever and deft touch. It widens the scope of the events.        I also liked the way the monster is slowly revealed. The producers figured there was no need to hang on the image. A great argument for less is more. I loved the special effects as well. To me they weren't gratuitous. They did the job they were intended to do. The shots of the crumbling city evokeda tremendous amount of emotion in me. It all seemed so real. Once again, I felt I wasn't looking at a movie as much as I was experiencing something first hand.       I'm of the school of criticism where movies should be rated within the context of what they are. Yes, this ultimately is a monster movie. These types of movies grab little attention in high circles, but if there were a \\"Best Monster Movie\\" category in the Academy Awards, this would walk away with a great number of Oscars. For what it is, there are few better.
0440236738|3.0|This book held my attention, but barely.  The plot was complex and very creative, but for some reason, it wasn't compelling.  Maybe it was the geography -- Livingston, NJ isn't exactly Hong Kong.  Maybe it was the adolescent attitude of the protagonist, who seems to have some issues with authority figures just doing their jobs. Maybe it was the holier-than-though attitude of two characters who assist runaway teens in New York's Hell's Kitchen.  I dunno.  It was a good story, but it just didn't turn me on. It was my first Coben book, so I'll try him again.

0060005696|5.0|Barry Schwartz explores interesting paradox. If we as consumer have a lot of choices, it does not mean that we would be able to make a better decision or be happier. In fact it is often quite opposite. The book is based on strong scientific foundation: psychology of judgment and decision-making behavioral economics. He includes references to Nobel award winning work by Kahneman and Tversky, as well as few other researchers. At the same time The Paradox or Choice is not a dry academic-like book: is it full of amusing real-life examples. What influence our choice? What factors would lead us to make irrational choice?  How to measure happiness and satisfaction? How to make trade-off? You will find answers on these and other questions.     Essentially Barry Schwartz uncovers from different points view what we already intuitively know: in order to be happy we don't need to buy more things or more expensive things. We just need to make choices, which will increase our satisfaction. What I took away after reading this book are a few simple ideas, that I can use in my every day life. For example, I will try to base my choices on detailed research rather than the memory of one vivid event. This is not as easy as it sounds as  we do not always follow our own rules of decision-making. Barry Schwartz's book helps us to reinforce our intent to make more rational choices.    I highly recommend this book.    Lev Virine, author of [[ASIN:1567262171 Project Decisions: The Art and Science]]
B0013D8LOU|5.0|When it comes to a work of the musical stage it is difficult to imagine a finer one than Stephen Sondheim's SWEENEY TODD: THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET. For those who saw the original 1979 Hal Prince extravagant production starring Angela Lansbury and Len Cariou/George Hearn, and then the 2005 revival as condensed so creatively by John Doyle and re-orchestrated by Sarah Travis who placed the orchestral instruments in the hands of the 10 actors who tell the story of the strange Todd, the Tim Burton (screenplay reduction by Josh Logan) film will only enhance the pleasures of seeing SWEENEY TODD resurrected in yet another form. Each of these incarnations has its riches and together they establish Sondheim's work as a masterpiece.<br /><br />Johnny Depp makes a convincing Sweeney Todd, in looks and demeanor as well as in singing voice, and Helena Bonham Carter's Mrs. Lovett fits right into Tim Burton's vision of the dark, squalid and seedy London.  Timothy Spall is perfect as the oily Beadle, Alan Rickman makes Judge Turpin an understandable villain, Jamie Campbell Bower and Jayne Wisener are suitably infatuated young lovers, and Sacha Baron Cohen and Ed Sanders give top flight cameos as Signor Pirelli and Toby. The one advantage of seeing this fine film on DVD is the option of turning on the subtitles so as not to miss a word of Sondheim's superb lyrics.<br /><br />For this viewer, however, the most successful version of this 'opera' is the John Doyle production currently on the boards in Los Angeles with Judy Kaye as the most satisfying Mrs. Lovett on record.  This uniquely economical and endlessly creative production goes to the core of the work better than any other version, and if this traveling company comes anywhere near your home, go see it!  It is the essential SWEENEY TODD and a fine adjunct to seeing the film version again and again.  Grady Harp, April 08
006135323X|5.0|Predictable Irrational is probably one of the most remarkable books after Freakonomics. This is a book about the paradoxes of human judgment. All people, regardless who they are, country they live in, jobs they have, or language they speak, make standard mistakes because our brains work in certain ways. Predictable Irrational is not the first book about such phenomena. My other favorite books on this subject include [[ASIN:B000TDGGVU The Paradox of Choice]] by Barry Schwartz and [[ASIN:B0014T9NDG Gut Feelings: The Intelligence of the Unconscious]] by Gerd Gigerenzer. Similar ideas are discussed in number of industry specific books, such as the project management book [[ASIN:1567262171 Project Decisions: The Art and Science]].     What distinguishes Predictable Irrational from the rest is very interesting real life examples and descriptions of some psychological experiments. Dan Ariely does not have complex discussions about psychology, instead he uses amusing examples to clearly illustrate his points. My favorite chapter is related to the effect of relativity and anchoring. Why, for example, have salaries of CEOs increased dramatically after federal security regulators forced companies to disclose them?  Or, why are people willing to pay ridiculous prices for luxury items, which does cost so little to produce?    We can train ourselves to be better decision-makes. In fact, decision-making is a key life skill. We may be able to overcome the illusions Dan Ariely talks about, by leaning about them. This is not easy as some illusions are quite hard to recognize. However, this does not mean that we should not try. It is like leaning to swim: at the beginning, people are afraid to swim. It is known psychological bias, but then people learn to overcome this bias by a series of drills using proven techniques. For example, I'm sure that when you start comparing prices in department stores, you will recall Dan Ariely's book and make better choices.     I highly recommend it.
0385338724|3.0|The premise of the book is fun and entertaining. The characters are all likeable enough and there are some very funny situations.  I have to admit that I was expecting it to be a bit more thrilling.  I figure that Lexi, the girl that wakes up with no memory of the last three years following a terrible car accident, should not be so confused by what she has made of herself over the last few years. The initial shock of things is understandable but the way she just can't figure things out as she goes along gets annoying. I am also very unsatisfied with the relationship she creates with her husband that she doesn't remember.  He seems to be willing to help her yet since there is no initial spark of interest in her towards him she kind of gives him up.  She must have loved him to marry him but that doesn't seem to be a factor.  Overall, it is a cute idea, but I don't think that it was played out as well as it could have been.
B000WTBMBK|3.0|Message to adventurous explorers of the music kingdom who enjoy the music on \\"Untrue\\" by Burial... let me point you on down the road a bit to something else you will probably enjoy when you are ready:<br /><br />Burial is sampling here, building collages with those samples, making a lot of references to loss and betrayal and showing us some bleak, dimly lit urban landscapes.<br /><br />If you have a taste for that, check out a CD titled [[ASIN:B000JJ4PPS Streamer]] by  Nils Petter Molvaer.  He creates big, dark, echoing expanses and decorates them with angular neon spikes and urban textures. Molvaer has several tasty CDs in this vein. [[ASIN:B000024UM7 Khmer]] is another  favorite, though it is hard to choose from all the delicious music Molvaer has recorded.<br /><br />Another artist from Europe doing a similar style (to Molvaer) is horn player Erik Truffaz. You won't find as much cut and paste sampling of vocal tracks but the spaces and textures are similar. Try [[ASIN:B0009VBU6S Saloua]] for a good taste of his \\"urban spaces at twilight.\\"<br /><br />Finally, though not quite as dark (or you could maybe say a bit more optimistic) you might try \\"[[ASIN:B000GQMK74 Melange Bleu]]\\" from Lars Danielsson. This is sliding over into jazz territory a little. The sonic spaces are still expansive, the bass still pumps, the urban vibe is still very present and periodically a mysterious voice calls out across dimly lit landscapes.<br /><br />Enjoy... well if \\"enjoy\\" is the correct term for music that tends toward solitary dimly lit introspection. Shuffling around in the dark here, hmmm, think I dropped my keys somewhere.
B00003CXCD|5.0|For anyone that isn't familiar with Audrey Hepburn's movies, this is the best one to start with... in my opinion this is her best work.  Roman Holiday is the movie that started it all for Hepburn, and you'll see why.  This is one of those movies that you can just escape in... it brings you into a fun, safe, playful world.  Hepburn and Peck are a perfect romantic match in this classic movie.  I whole heartedly recommend this film to anyone!
0307394549|5.0|This is one of the very best cookie books that I have purchased.  Clear easy recipes, great pictures.  I recommend this for everyone.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|I just love this show, this is the first show after The X-Files and Buffy that got me hooked. The story telling is just simply brilliant, you can tell they have some of the same writers as the greatest shows on television. I really love to watch the story unfold.    Besides that the SE and the settings are amazing. Some of the SE and settings make me think of the days of The X-Files. How I much that show.     And of course I can not forget to say something about the Winchester Boys. Oh how I love them. The strong relationship they have. I can feel it. It's the same bond I have with my younger brother. I really can relate. The emotional part that is. And of course those two guys are just  candy for the eye.    Can't wait for season 3 to arrive on dvd.   I will import it straight away from The U.S.A.    A supernatural tremendous show!
B00005N6KG|4.0|Bought these about 3 weeks ago and have used about a dozen times.  Use them only for running, mowing, or other yard work.  I have an electric mower, so they don't need to be too loud and they work fine under the conditions I've subjected them to.  I suspect there will be more problems when the weather gets warmer and sweat increases, but for now they still work even after the conditions in my ears are somewhat \\"moist.\\"    Obviously the sound isn't high fidelity, but they're good for what I need them for.
0743455967|5.0|I'd heard a lot of talk about this book being the eminent book for a developing writer to read. It did not live up to the hype initially, but redeemed itself in the end.    I enjoyed the conversational tone King took in this book. Reading it is like reading a letter from an old friend. He does a great job of describing his early writing life and imparting the urgency for writing that all young authors hope to have.    The advice given in the latter section is invaluable. Most of it is stuff that most writers have heard ad nauseum, but King puts it all succinctly. He makes the reader believe that writing is a gift that we have. It is up to us to put in the work and time to make ourselves better. It is up to us to improve our craft.    This book left me very hopeful for my writing future. Thank you, Stephen King.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Highly recommended- This is the best production that I've seen and heard since the Phantom.  The music is wonderful, and it feeds a great story.  Amazon's price is incredibly reasonable, especially considering how expensive this is at the show and in stores.
0143038583|1.0|This book had a lot of potential, but the narrative was uninteresting.    Pollan is obviously passionate about food and its ramifications for society. However, this book reads like a textbook. It is overly dry and focused on facts.    I couldn't get into it, even after giving it a second try.
0060558121|4.0|Neil Gaiman does the modern fairy tale thing very well with this one, which is neat, because I don't usually care for fairy tales. The book is fairly long but I found it very engaging. The characters were cool, the setting very gritty and intriguing, and the research is excellent. I never thought reading about coin tricks could be this interesting, but somehow it is. One thing Gaiman does well is write about places, and you can really feel the atmosphere of all the locations Shadow visits.<br /><br />I do wish I knew more mythology before starting this book though. Most of the characters are explained well, but some are not, and I feel like I was missing out not knowing the history of some of the Gods.<br /><br />A couple things bothered me. First, I was not clear on how the mythology of it all worked - how the Gods get their power - and a lot of questions were left unanswered. The other thing that bugged me is the sheer amount of sex in the book. Every couple chapters or so Gaiman threw in yet another sex sequence, and it was just plain excessive.  Besides that, I thought the ending was somewhat anti-climactic, but it still worked.<br /><br />This book is riveting from start to finish. And somewhat funny too (specifically, the part with the raven made me laugh out loud).  Definitely a great read for people who like modern fantasy and aren't scared away by adult situations.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|This is a good movie.  I've enjoy it.  I've seen it twice and will see it again.  I just love to see Jane's Austen characters being play in the movies.
B000007492|5.0|'The Very Best of Supertramp' is by far the best Supertramp compilation on the American market. Almost identical to 'Classics, Vol. 9,' only this set features the full-length album versions, and adds my favorite song from the 'Crime of the Century' record, 'School.'    Mostly every single Supertramp hit is here. 'Give A Little Bit,' 'Take The Long Way Home,' 'Breakfast In America,' 'The Logical Song,' 'Cannonball' and 'Rudy' all appear on this set for your listening pleasure. And, A&M gets tons of credit for remastering these tracks beautifully. In translation, the sound quality is excellent!    And, album cuts like 'Crime of the Century' and 'Ain't Nobody But Me' also appear on this set.     Overall, if you buy it with 'The Very Best of Supertramp 2,' than you'll have all of Supertramp's important songs. But overall, this is highly recommended for the new or casual fan.     Highly recommended. ENJOY!!!
B00005MP58|5.0|This a good one.  I like this very much then the other cause it goes along with the book that I've read. If prefer a short movie then watch the Pride and Prejudice 2005.  I like this one best!
0439813786|5.0|I purchased this book as an educational tool and ended up loving it for pure reading enjoyment.  This is a book for all ages, young to old.  Fantastic.
0143038419|5.0|I loved this book from beginning to end, I laughed, cried and was with her on every step of her journey.  There were so many aha moments for me.  I have read the reviews in which people have been saying she is self-absorbed etc, I did not find this at all.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|Buy it for Vegas, One Sweet Love, Come Round Soon, Love on the Rocks, Many the Miles and all the other great tracks on this album with hints of jazz and raw vocal talent. If you're open-minded enough to be influenced by anything other than pop radio, you'll see that Love Song is grossly overestimated compared to the rest of her songs.  The simplicity and unexpected progressions in Vegas and classic swaggering feel of Many the Miles make it all a joy to listen to. Combined with vocals that flow naturally, this is a caliber of musicianship I haven't been exposed to in a while. Little Voice just joined Happenstance as one of two cds I will not grow tired of anytime soon.
B000VWE5OY|5.0|A terrific compilation of the first season with tons of extras. The Commentary and the ability to watch with subtitles during the commentary made this a treat. A friend who was visiting and had never seen the show went thru the entire set in two days !!! I thought I was obsessed. Can't wait for series 2 to come to DVD as a box set and hold out hope for a series three. Best thing from BBC for adult SF fans in a long time. THANK YOU RUSSELL T. DAVIES !!!
B0013D8LOU|5.0|Simply amazing.  Stephen Sondheim is a genius.  Simultaneously hideous and beautiful, Tim Burton's vision of Sweeney Todd is a macabre delight!
0452289963|2.0|Difficult to follow---having a had time reading it.  Material is interesting but I have to read some sentences more than once to grasp what the author is saying.
B000V86OKG|3.0|After a blistering first series, I felt that much of the second series of \\"Dexter\\" was a bit of a letdown. The basic premise of the series, which I am not going into here, is very solid and allows the viewer to be concerned about the central character (which in itself creates the weird scenario of rooting for very dubious guy indeed), but before long we are introduced to the very irritating character of Lyla Turney. This is where the interesting central premise of the show gets eclipsed somewhat by a cheap soap-opera-like \\"which girl will Dexter end up with\\" type narrative that is, quite frankly boring.    The main fault of season 2 is that the producers have seen fit to add in some Hollywood sex (in the first season he couldn't really do it), some soap-opera plot devices and have chosen to give Dexter more human emotions. This is a bad move, as by humanising Dexter too much, it tends to make him less interesting. The charm of the Dexter series is that the viewer becomes attached to a guy who is essentially a nutter (albeit with a somewhat justifiable moral code). But as this gets eroded, I felt that that my interest was being eroded too. To a point where there was considerable time between my viewing of episode 7 and episode 8. In contrast, I watched the first series in two sittings. There were times in season 2 that was just waiting for Dexter to kill someone...anyone.    I do recommend the second season though, don't get me wrong. It has a good central story, mostly good acting and returns with all the strong characters from the first season and develops them somewhat further. The only problem with the secondary characters is with Debra's unrealistic relationship with her new boyfriend. It's ok, but I felt her character could have been developed in a much better way, especially after her experiences in the first series. Again, the result is very soap-opera and made me tune out to a degree.    The best character (other than Dexter) is James Doakes and he returns in the second season too in one of the more interesting subplots of the series that has a great conclusion.    The bottom line is that Dexter Season 2 is just not as good as the utterly brilliant season 1 (which was simply the best thing on TV for a long, long time).     But for about 8 episodes, I felt myself continually losing interest rapidly. However,  by episode 9 or so, I was hooked again and the season builds to a great finale. So much so, that I cannot wait for season 3.    What I would like to see in season 3 is a little more ambiguity from Dexter, certainly I want to see more of his serial killer exploits...and a little more blood'n'gore for good measure.
B0013FYTA8|4.0|I will start by saying this is a fantastic CD from top to bottom. Well-written and well-composed ballads coupled with some heavy-hitters make it one of the best rock albums so far this year. That being said, it sounds as though the songs on this album were written by Chris Daughtry, rather than by TOAD. The album's liner notes even say that Daughtry co-wrote the lyrics to \\"By the Way.\\" If you listen to Daughtry's first CD and then this one, you will find some glaring similarites. The songs sound way too pop-rock instead of that hard-edged sound that has made TOAD such a good band. What made Gasoline and TOAD such great albums was that bad-a**, sloppy hard sound that TOAD is known for. This album simply sounds like TOAD just won American Idol and the whole thing was written for them by professional song writers.    Let's not overlook the album for what it is, though. \\"So Happy\\" has the classic TOAD sound and feel to it. \\"By the Way\\" is an awesome dark ballad that could be a hit. Other ballads such as \\"Heaven,\\" \\"Not Meant to Be,\\" and \\"All Or Nothing\\" are all tremendous ballads while \\"Crutch,\\" \\"Bad Girlfriend,\\" and \\"Hate My Life\\" are some sick rockers. \\"End of the Summer\\" might as well be covered by Daughtry on his next album, but is still a great song.     TOAD deliver a strong effort on their 3rd album, but it just doesn't sound like them. Still, this album is a great piece of hard rock. If you can get past the comparisons to Nickelback and the almost identical sound to Daughtry, then you will love this album. If not, then it will be tough to enjoy this CD for what it really is.
0977326403|5.0|I am currently doing my Masters in Organizational Leadership. It is extremely difficult to find literature that explains a non-profit organizational structure. Bravo for Jim Collins in attempting to bridge the gap between theory and the non-profit organization!<br /><br />The book is an excellent read that captures the uniqueness of social sector organizations. It is a must read and must own for anyone researching organizational design in that it captures the unique view of organizations that do not exists to meet a bottom line.<br /><br />Alexandra B.

B0013D8LOK|4.0|Great movie. Worth watching and the music is beautifully written.<br /><br />It is a critical improvement from the play.
B000002KKX|5.0|Nearly 30 years after its release, Christopher Cross' self-titled debut album reads like a soft rock masterpiece. From the memorable melodies and choruses to the expert instrumentation from the backing musicians, every track is excellent. At a time when albums rarely spawned three hit singles, this album produced four and could have pumped out two more if Warner Brothers so desired to. It's that good.  Without a doubt, the best songs are the dramatic \\"Ride Like the Wind\\" (often heard as a lead in on the Coast to Coast with George Noory show) and the solemn ballad \\"Sailing\\", two of the best adult contemporary songs ever that have aged very well. The bouncy \\"Say You'll Be Mine\\" and the reflective ballad \\"Never Be the Same\\" would also become big hits and are nearly as impressive. The R&B of \\"I Really Don't Know Anymore\\" (which like \\"Ride Like the Wind\\", features the unmistakable backing vocals of Michael McDonald) and the mellow rock of \\"Spinning\\" are just as great and could have been hits. The remaining tracks (\\"Poor Shirley\\", \\"The Light Is On\\", and the closing \\"Minstrel Gigolo\\") are also top notch. I rarely say this about an album but this is one long highlight. While I've always felt that most adult contemporary music is too safe, you can't argue with an album where every song is great and every arrangement is flawless. Highest recommendation.
B0009HLD0K|4.0|Having attended IU my Freshman year ('69/'70), I can attest that Breaking Away was certaingly not filmed on a Hollywood sound stage, but entirely in Bloomington, Indiana as the film's end credits proclaim.  It is a delightful movie the whole family can enjoy.  It is a relatively short movie with many funny moments (Paul Dooley is fantastic) and for me, reminiscent of my days at IU (the warm waters of the abandoned stone quarries, the beautiful IU library and the Little 500 race to name a few).  Wonderful characters make the story extremely enjoyable.  It's one of my favorite movies.   ...LAP
B0001XAOL6|5.0|Ali  DVD<br /><br />Will Smith is eerily like Ali.  It's like Cassiuss Clay is playing himself.  I remember watching Clay fight in the Olympics and Smith has him down pat.  I'd admired Ali for being willing to go to prison for his convictions instead of fleeing to Canada like all the other bed-wetting, Mommas boys who opposed the War in Viet Nam.  Jon Voight is good as Howard Cosell, who was a nobody until he weaseled his way into Ali's  life.  I understand that Smith and Voight both received Academy Award nominations for their roles in this move.  I wonder how Smith \\"bulked up\\" for this role.<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of Will Smith, Jon Voight, boxing the way it use to be, and Cassius Clay, aka Mohammed Ali.<br /><br />Gunner  April, 2008
B000089CJI|5.0|I came to this album with fresh ears, meaning I had never heard Death Cab For Cutie, or Dntel.  In fact, I'd never heard anything by either of them.  I happened to stumble upon this one day on Pandora.<br /><br />After reading all the rave reviews and hearing a few samples I bought the album.<br /><br />The first time I listened I thought \\"Ehh, it's okay.  Not sure what all the hype is about.\\"<br /><br />Then I found the songs stuck in my head.  So I listened again.. and again.. and, well now I am listening to this album every single day.<br /><br />It is quite simply an intelligent, innovative, original and flat out fun album.<br /><br />Highlights include \\"We Will Become Silhouettes\\" and \\"Nothing Better\\" and  \\"Brand New Colony\\".  The atari-like bass in \\"Nothing Better\\" is sort of weird and almost annoying at first but like the rest of the album it works its way into your brain and eventually you end up loving the way it meshes so perfectly with Ben's voice.<br /><br />The weakest tracks are \\"This Place Is A Prison\\" and \\"Sleeping In\\".  The former is just boring, the latter would be OK but the lyrics are a little pretentious.
B0011HF6GE|4.0|For those Iron and Wine fans who are disappointed at Sam Beam's more produced sound, you will clap your hands in glee at the first sound of \\"For Emma, Forever Ago.\\"  And although the title of this review sounds flip (and a bit uncomplimentary), this is the closest I can come to describing the sound of Bon Iver to someone who hasn't heard it yet.  Justin's falsetto, in addition to the Americana overtones lent by the use of banjo and the occasional rhythmic chorus do not pigeonhole the musical style - rather, it seems to make something completely new.  There is an ineffable appeal to the combination of ethereal, disjointed lyrics and solidly earthy string instruments that immediately lifts the heart.    The album cover is exactly the picture of what I feel when listening to the music - like, in the middle of a hard winter, hope is here.  There's sadness and loneliness, but we are looking out the window and seeing the signs of Spring and renewal amidst the mostly barren landscape.    The album's jewels are evident in the first 5 tracks.  \\"Flume\\" and \\"Skinny Love\\" are the most accessible tracks, proven by the airplay they have gotten.  I like \\"Lump Sum\\" for its easy rhythm, and \\"The Wolves (Act I and II\\" with its spiritual feel has some beautiful parts that more or less make up for the occasionally jarring vocals.  \\"Blindsided\\" is a warm and solid effort, if a bit more tame and the chorus on \\"Creature Fear\\" will stick with you for days...at which point the album sort of tapers off.  I've no idea why the title track is buried at the end of the track list...after such catchy openers, it's a hard act to follow and does not do  \\"For Emma\\" justice.  But from start to finish, this is a beautifully crafted album, each track contributing to a satisfying totality.      And it doesn't get old, either.  Each listen provides some new detail to marvel at.      I'm torn between wanting to see this album get the widespread attention it deserves, and wanting to pretend it is my very own secret!
B000J103PC|5.0|It's funny, entertaining, a la Sex and the City the way it's all about fashion and life in big city NY.<br /><br />Merryl Streep makes an awesome Cruela Deville meets a somber Janice Dickinson type. Anne Hathaway's perfect in it and that good looking guy from that HBO show (can't remember his name...), nice to see him in it.<br /><br />The book's pretty good too!

0765318741|5.0|I currently read the book I Am Legend by Richard Matheson. In this book there are about nine other stories, but I Am Legend is the main attraction. Robert Neville is a brilliant scientist and a virus has broken out incurable and manmade that has mutated every other man, woman, and child into bloodthirsty, nocturnal creatures who are determined to destroy him. Somehow immune, Robert is now the last human survivor in what is left of New York City, and maybe the world. As day comes he scavenges for food and supplies, desperate to find any other survivors who might be out there. Although the infected lurk in the shadows watching his every move waiting for him to make a deathly mistake. Maybe mankinds last, best hope, Robert is motivated to find to reverse the effects of the virus using his own immune blood is also what the infected want. Robert knows he is outnumbered and is quickly running out of time.... I would recommend this book to people who are opened minded and think of the possibilities that can happen.
B000NA2BEU|3.0|The new channel changed some of the style of the first two seasons, and several of the characters (Pez or Pizz or whatever the lamer's name was) took time away from more worthy characters, like Wallace and Mac. A bittersweet ending that sort of summed up the tragedy of another great show getting dumped for lowest denominator trash like Pussy Cat Bimbos. Held off buying this final season until the price became so attractive even a curmudgeon as myself had to open the wallet.
B0010X8NF0|4.0|Anderson's 'Rushmore', with Bill Murray is one of my personal top ten.  This movie also struck a personal cord, having travelled the trains of India, etc. Recommended for Anderson fans, perhaps not the best place to develop a habit though.    BTW, saw the Charlie Rose interview of Anderson and they discussed the 1971 movie, 'Harold and Maude' as an influence.  Just saw that one, and I see the link.  Cat Stevens sound track makes that another truly offbeat comedy with a bit of personal bite.
009926689X|1.0|As a psychologist looking for healthy constructive relationships to be represented in my child's books, I too find this book to be disturbing in the way that it normalizes unhealthy behavior and attitudes.      Why must the mother deplore all the son's changing behaviors as he grows?  Why can't she continue to actively love him through his inevitable changes?  Why must she only express her love at night when the son cannot receive it?  Healthy expression of emotion involves loving people through the behaviors we don't care for.  In this story, she withholds her love and acceptance as he grows, then can only express it under the cover of darkness, fantasizing that he is still a baby.      In addition, to normalize the invasiveness of this mother's use of a ladder to enter her grown son's bedroom (hello??) and physically cradle him (HELLO??) is truly disturbing.    It represents a host of boundary violations, and would be called stalking were they not related.  This mother is looking to get her emotional needs met in very inappropriate ways.  Ask yourself this: if this were the mother of your husband, or the father of your wife, and this were happening in your home at night, how would you feel about this behavior?    A parent's role is to build and nurture close, healthy ties with their children, but always see them for who they are right now (a large portion of family therapy cases arise out of parents' inability to do this). Although we will always be mothers and fathers, our role as parent is meant to wane as children grow.  Failure to understand that is failure to see one's child for who they've grown into, and instead to hold them as \\"always my baby.\\"      Yes, we will not leave; yes, we will love you forever; yes, you may misbehave, and though we may not like the behavior we will continue to love you--these are healthy messages.  The message of this book is that mom may not like who you become and what you do, but she'll invade your house and express her love inappropriately.        **It is important, indeed essential, that we be conscious of the words, messages, and attitudes that we convey to our children.**  The attitudes and behaviors in this book are unhealthy, and show inappropriate withholding and displaying of emotion.  The author should be in therapy, not writing children's books.
0783240287|5.0|To be quite honest I was skeptical when I heard my friend giving rave reviews of Donny Osmond's performance in the Lloyd Weber-Rice musical \\"Joesph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.\\" However since my seven year old is a fan of Andrew Lloyd Weber's hit musical \\"Cats\\" I decided to give it a go. I was not disappointed. Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat was written in the late 1960's by Andrew Lloyd Weber and Tim Rice after having been approached by a friend to write an end of term musical for his school to produce. After throwing ideas back and forth Tim Rice came up with the idea of a musical based on the Bible story of Joseph and as they say the rest is history. This production features a talented ensamble of performers with Donny Osmond as Joseph, Maria Friedman as the narrator, Sir Richard Attenborough as Jacob and Joan Collins as Mrs. Potiphar. This is a musical production which is sure to delight both children and adults.
B0014DC0AK|5.0|Chuck Schuldiner was a true innovator of death metal even though he despised the genre. Other bands were about more brutality, more satanism, more of whatever they could do to outdo each other. He wasn't all about that. For him, it was about musicianship and to not be limited in his craft. It was in his quest to break limitations though that he decided after The Sound Of Perseverance to end the band and go on to Control Denied (a very different band). His battle though would later be with cancer, and a neverending struggle. He passed away in late 2001. As many would say, his legecy has grown as he was a big influence in the metal world. For a few years, I had heard Death from time to time, but never really sat down to listen. Recently, I started taking interest...and that brings me to Symbolic, my favorite Death album. After reading that this was gonna be remastered, I held off on buying it because you can only go one way with it, and that's to get the best sounding version. While I can't really comment on anything in particular because I've never listened to the album track by track before the remastering, I can say that the sound is massive. Anybody who's ever heard this album doesn't need reassurance that this is a good buy, they just need to pick it up.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|Ok, so the copyright protection thing sucks...this is true...intellectual property is a hot issue right now and probably won't be resolved anytime soon.  I have it on my computer..it worked just fine...so there...<br />But just because I don't agree with copyright laws doesn't mean I am going to deny myself the bliss and wonder of the music of Foo Fighters.  It would be like cutting off your nose to spite your face.  The music moves me and every song is wonderful!  I especially like the second album with the more acoustic set.  It's just so beautiful...I'm listening to it right now and just love it.  I have played it non stop for a few years now and am no where near tired of it yet.  You will find yourself singing along to every song and just loving every second of it.  Foo Fighters remains my favorite band of all time...with Led Zeppelin close behind...yes that's right...behind Foo Fighters.
B000LC4CVA|4.0|I am a lover of celtic music. In this DVD, you have celtic drumming, fiddle playing and beautiful voices all on one DVD. The orchestration and the presentation is marvelous. This DVD was featured as a promotional gift on PBS not long ago.  I fully recommend this DVD to anyone.
B0012OQZWA|5.0|This is by far one of the best death metal bands I have ever heard in my life.
089898890X|5.0|The best educational book on jazz. Covers ride cymbal, comping, solo ideas, uptempo, brushes and has a good play along cd. All of the written words do a fantastic job of putting things in context. Mr. Riley clearly knows his stuff. \\"Beyond Bop Drumming\\" is also a great book for more advanced jazz playing.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I haven't exercised consistently in about 3 years so I'm doing Level 1. I've only done if for 2 days, but it's a great workout. It's intense and you are done before you know it!    My only complaint is that there is no diet/nutrition information other than referring you to her website or other books. Also, it seems somewhat misleading. 30 Day Shred - meaning if I do this for 30 days in a row, I will see results? Or does it allow you to take any days off? And losing up to 20 pounds...if I only do this workout? I guess I would like some clarification. Anyone have any ideas? I mean, we all know to cut our calorie intake and what to eat, but I would like to know specifically what to do in terms of exercise and nutrition what I need to do to lose 20 pounds in 30 days.
B00104QSOM|5.0|you have rocks in your head, Daniel Plainview in my opinion could be one of the greatest characters ever created in the history of American film...  Truly a masterpiece, the triumph of capitalism!!!
0143038583|5.0|Everyone in this country should consider it required reading.  It's not a novel, so it may seem a bit tedious at times, but you will be provoked to comment or at least grunt at the number of facts you hadn't heard previously.   I've already talked several others into buying it, and  their responses were unanimously similar.    Gee -  I never knew that, or  that's simply disgusting.  Makes for many interesting lunch conversations.
B000Y179KO|3.0|One disc's worth of great new material, another disc for Don Henley's colossal ego. The title song is good, but it's all we'll ever need of Henley's continuous whining about the war, global warming mythology, how stupid Americans are, how stupid his relationships are, etc. More dull rehash of his solo efforts.     Copy the rest to your PC and burn a single disc -- you'll have a winner.    Sleeper hit: Joe Walsh on \\"Last Good Time in Town\\".
0767817478|1.0|This American reimagining to the 1954 masterpiece has amazing CGI effects, but that doesn't make it good. Instead of  Godzilla we get a giant CGI iguana running around New York city, who's only purpose is to lay eggs and not destroy buildings. Even when Godzilla makes his/her's  first appearance he/she still doesn't still anything and Godzilla has lost all it's power which means godzilla can't kill people with atomic breath all this tuna head can do is runaway from the military,because it knows it's weak. Anyways enough about the giant iguana in the movie nobody seems to be surpise or scared that a gigantic iguana is attacking NYC everyone acts like it's a normal thing. Can you see why everyone hates this movie and also somewhere in the middle of the movie Godzilla's egg hatches a bunch of mini Godzilla's start running around chasing the main characters just because they smelled like fish, right there everyone should know that the director tried to rip off Jurassic Park. Godzilla's babies even looked like the raptures in the movie.    Before I finish this review I going to say that not even the plot made sense,because in the movie Godzilla is a mutated iguana which is a reptile, but Mathew Brodrick's character keeps saying it's an anphibian throughout the whole movie even though it's an iguana.    1 out of 5
B0015XHQTE|4.0|Sorry for the weird comparison but the movie series which DIRTY HARRY most reminds me of is PLANET OF THE APES: one classic first entry, a very aceptable third one (Escape vs. The Enforcer), two mediocre others (second and fourth) and a totally irrelevant one (the fifth). As a matter of fact, I hate to admit it but I've never seen DEATH POOL, by the time it came out I'd just about lost all interest in the series. I guess when this set comes along I will finally have run out of excuses not to see it.  Anyway, I'm very much looking for this box set, my only real complaint is the price: fifty something dollars vs. the thirty some PLANET OF THE APES cost me a couple of years ago seems quiet a bit, at any rate, the DIRTY HARRY replica police badge and other extras ought to make up for the difference as they make this set an offer one can't refuse.  As for each movie, having recently seen ZODIAC I can't wait to watch DIRTY HARRY again. I love the THE ENFORCER's ending set in Alcatraz, I thought it was a lot more exciting then ESCAPE FROM ALCATRAZ itself. MAGNUM FORCE and SUDDEN IMPACT weren't all that bad, the problem with the latter was the casting of Sandra Locke who, around the time the movie came out, was in just about all of Clint's movies (which wasn't necessarily a good thing).  As for DEATH POOL, well, we'll soon see...........
B0007DAZW8|5.0|Alot of people said that this album was repetetive, well if your into House music you would be use to beats repeating over and over again anyways even though this is not a house album it's still awesome featuring some nice guitar playing by Daft Punk.     The song \\"Human After All\\" is defintly my favorite song off the album, even time I listen I imagine me riding in a motorcycle in the night. The guitars and robot vocals just takes you into a futuristic world, where robots and humans unite.    \\"The Primetime of Your Life\\" is a song I can't really relate, but it's still a pretty good song.This song can take you to a dark and scary place, where everyone is depending on you.    \\"Robot Rock\\" is that song that you just have rock out to, the bass is crazy. Even though Daft Punk only took a sample and replaced the lyrics I still love it, this song that got me into Electro.    \\"Steam Machine\\" is a song  that I only listen to when I'm mad, I don't listen to this song often though.    \\"Make Love\\" is probably one of the best songs in the world, it's so sad. When I listen to this one I imagine me getting older and  how I'm just wasting my life just living off of movies because you know that you may never find that true love.    \\"The Brainwasher\\" is when I feel that the Governments are brainwashing us with lies.    when I listen to \\"Television Rules The Nation\\" I look at my life and how I'm just living off of movies and TV. The guitars in this track is addicting.    I'm pretty sure everyone knows \\"Technologic\\" Busta Rhymes sampled it, it was used in the IPOD comercial, and people danced to it many times on television. This is the only song on the album that sounds kind of like Daft Punk's old stuff.    Finally we have \\"Emotion\\" the song I listen to when I'm depressed. The song is very sad and the robots voice just makes everything even sadder.    Well what can I say, but that Human After All was not a let down it.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|The Good Things<br />*Unrestricted levels of violence and brutality, realistically portraying a society in a downward spiral.  It's very intense and thought-provoking.<br />*Camera style, even though is free-handed, is still very smooth and slick (meaning that it doesn't shake around too much).<br />*Many action scenes use very long cuts, showing off the actors' and director's mastery in timing, acting, and details.  The logistics of these scenes are complex, so it is very impressive.<br />*The film's color greatly adds to the dismal atmosphere.<br />*Strong ethnic influences literally teleport the viewer into a unique setting.  To me, the British refugee camp resembles the streets of Iraq (thus making it relevant to today's current events).<br />*Some scenes stick out vividly in my head (in particular, the ending scene where everybody stops fighting and bows down to the newborn baby...).<br />*What few special effects the film has are very effective.  I couldn't even tell that it had any.<br />*The characters are fairly well developed.  Their deaths are quite tragic.<br />*Good sound and music design.<br />*Good production design.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Some people may find the violence and brutality a bit much.  Overall, it is a bleak film.<br />*They never did explain how people became infertile (then again, I think it's a minor point).<br />*Didn't really want certain characters to die...<br />*Not sure how close it is to the original novel.<br /><br />This is one of the only few movies that makes me feel depressed (second only to \\"The Passion\\").  Aside from the intense brutal violence, the film serves as a shadowy mirror to modern-day society.  It effectively portrays rampant terrorism, human cruelty, and injustices of worldly powers.  The filming of it is excellent in its own right, with slick camera work and very complex action scenes.  But it is not like a typical sci-fi blockbuster; it's focus is more on artistery, thought-provoking ideas, and emotional impact.  I think it is very effective, and is a definate eye-opener into what the future could possibly be if things continue to go as they are.<br /><br />DVD includes some fascinating featurettes; one that analyzes modern-day society, and one that shows the making of the film.  And then there's the trailer.  Pretty good deal.r into what the future could possibly be if things continue to go as they are.

B00005QW5X|4.0|I'm giving this four stars for John Cameron Mitchell, the graphic and animation, the excellent soundtrack, and the overall idea.<br />I'm leaving out one star because there wasn't really that much to the story.<br />If the lack of plot doesn't bother you too much, you will probably enjoy the story of the East German wanna-be transsexual Hedwig, the band, the dreary tour of Bilgewater restaurants in the U.S., and the love/hate affair with Tommy Gnosis, who was Hedwig's lover until he stole the latter's songs for his own album and took all the credit.
B00005JMXX|3.0|The Good Things<br />*Smashing special effects.  Very detailed, vivid, and exciting.<br />*Some memorable scenes.<br />*Storyline is relatively engaging; hardly boring.<br />*I suppose this is somewhat relevant to today's issues concerning climate change.<br />*Acting was not too bad.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Highly unbelievable.  Even if supercell storm systems have some kind of wierd cold air front, there's no way helicopters could freeze over in seconds and crash.  Some parts are downright silly; people were literally running away from growing frost.<br />*Sometimes, the characters act dumb; a few parts where you could yell at the screen for the people to run and seek shelter.  However, some of this stupidity is believable.<br />*Heavy focus on drama can be seen as sappy.<br /><br />Only a step better than other disaster movies like \\"The Core,\\" this film has a typical plot with typical characters.  It is well made, with fantastic special effects, some interesting imagery, and adequate acting.  Some aspects can also be relevant to modern-day issues in climate change (and possibly immigration).  It is still a little shallow and highly unbelievable.  Fans of disaster films, or people who like good special effects, should probably check this out.  Otherwise, it is quite weak.
B00005JPFH|1.0|This was a gift for my brother, he loved the movie but the bad part of this purchase was that it came with a large circular sticker on the very cool 3D effect cardboard coverbox!  Have companies become this thoughtless - I ask you, would you like your COLLECTOR'S coverbox to have a LARGE neon ACTION sticker on it that cannot be removed without ruining the COLLECTOR'S EDITION box.  Absolutely moronic!!!
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|Love this album.  It rocks hard for the most part (Living Well Is The Best Revenge, Man-Sized Wreath, Accelerate, Horse To Water, I'm Gonna DJ), but also includes a couple classic R.E.M. style folk rockers (Houston, Until The Day Is Done).  They held rehearsals for most of these songs in Dublin, Ireland.  In front of great fans who never turned there back on R.E.M. when they released Up, Reveal and Around the Sun.  Up, by the way  is a great album and if you don't have it yet, you must get it.  That said, those of you who gave up on them will once again fall in love with these great songs.  Yeah, it's not Automatic For the People, so if you don't like to rock, I would suggest at least downloading Supernatural Superserious, Hollow Man, Houston, Until The Day Is Done, Mr. Richards and Sing For The Submarine.
1401216676|5.0|Blurbs on a cover always tell you that whatever book you're holding in your hands is better than the best, that you'd probably die if you'd put it back to where it came from, and more of that kind of nonsense.   In this case (in 1988) they had Tim Burton saying it's his favorite and that it's the first comic he ever loved. The poor fellow. Don't get me wrong: I adore Tim Burton. I love everything he did (after Batman), but there definitely are other great comic books out there.  But still, he is right in saying that this one counts among the best. That is, now it does. Now that Brian Bolland himself has redone the original coloring (by John Higgins). I love Brian Bolland. He is one of my all time favorite artists, a genius in black and white (which best brings out his fine and detailed pencils). And he did a great coloring job here, too. The colors are more pastel and thus bring back a balance to the book I missed in the 1988 paperback.  The original coloring looked as if Mr. Higgins had just bought himself a new set of colors and went for it. There was so much yellow, green and red dripping off the pages that it stopped me from entering the storyline. It looked seventies cheap. Also, to my taste it almost destroyed Brian's genius penciling.  Which is a shame, cause it's a masterpiece (yes, another one) written by Alan Moore. Not for kiddies. The Joker is too brutal for that here. A dark tale about insanity, true insanity, the ways of getting there and what it can lead to. The Joker is meaner and deeper than ever. Batman isn't weak, after all he's Batman, right?! But then, why is it so hard for him this time to deal with the creep? That is, can he?  As a small extra there is a bonus story of a few pages, a few sketches and  instead of the tpb's first page with the splattering raindrops, you get a set of bloody eyes staring at you out of the dark.  Highly recommended. Buy this new version and enjoy Mr. Bolland's genius artwork and Mr. Moore's timeless tale.
B000002AHM|5.0|Those who whine about this being too break-neck obviously can't let their minds (and guts) go to that place. Not everything needs to be perfectly paced and full of musical chiaroscuro. Sometimes you just want to rock!<br /><br />I have various bootlegs from this tour and they are all incredible for the ferocity and passion the trio brings to this music. This is definitiely the best night that I've heard; we're lucky to have it in such perfect sound quality.<br /><br />The highlight is definitely Sundance, where Paco's feel and touch makes DiMeloa's oft-emotionless palm-muted runs at 200 miles an hour take on much more heart. Paco keeps up and then some; Al needed a pick to blaze this hard, Paco did not! McLaughlin is no slouch either, and there's really no dull moment here.<br /><br />It is indeed a master class for guitarists; I'll never forget hearing it for the first time at age 19 and realizing that acoustic git can wail just as hard as electric. It's also just plain exciting for any pair of ears, musician's or not! Like a strong cup of coffee on a windy mountain side at 5 am, this will get the juices flowing.<br /><br />These guys know each other's styles so well and mesh so perfectly; for that alone this is five stars. Add the sonic insanity of this many notes played with this much flawless technique and you've got something truly unique and magical. Not a ballad album, nor was it meant to be. The trio has other albums that address that issue; this one is all about amazement and joy.<br /><br />Still unmatched almost 30 years later.
B00005JPLW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. A true war movie, not for the faint of heart though! Lot's of fighting and death!
B0013BNY2Q|3.0|clocking in at a ridiculous 34 minutes,this extends yet another in a series of rather lackluster efforts for REM.Turning up the amps does little to mask what is yet another rather forgettable batch of tunes.If this was even a close return to form for a once great band,the 34 minutes would be a welcome relief.As it is,it is a disc I played a few times,but will seldom return to again.Fortunately REM has a vast body of work to return to,songs that still can move you in directions that seem like a long ago memory.Which of course rings true once again
B000JBWWRY|2.0|I love Peter and pirates and Mermaids--but this was made in 1951--so Watch Out.  I didn't like my 3 yr old hearing things like \\"girls talk too much\\" and indians called \\"redskins\\" and the WORST was Tinkerbell wondering if her [...] was too fat!! If you are careful about what your littles ones watch, skip this one for now.
B00004R7PB|5.0|It took me a little while to get accustomed to this recording. I liked it from the first, but it still took a while to think of it as \\"Water Music\\". I mean, the New York Phil. and all the other big orchstras do a fine job, but they tend to homogenize the different movements. This is a superb chamber outfit, and they are much more adaptable: the fast movements are faster than I was used to, the slow ones are slower, and the larger differences between them are what took a while to get used to. The differences in dynamics are correspondingly wider. To boil it down, it's just a lot more fun to listen to. And boy, does it grow on me! It's far more entertaining than the other versions I've heard -- and isn't that what this is? Entertainment?    As far as which style is more faithful to how Handel would have originally performed it, who can know? But his original orchestra for this piece had to fit on a boat to perform it, plus they had to somehow keep their listeners awake while they rocked on the waves of the Thames and ate huge meals, so I suspect that this smaller chamber group and its greater dynamic and rhythmic variety is closer to the mark.     The only drawback is the opening brass line: it sounds as though the player wasn't quite ready to get started, or was just a little nervous for a few bars. But I'm only talking about the first ten seconds, so again, who cares...? Really nice stuff.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Get it..it's great and worth EVERY penny..my second favorite DVD (#1 is Hall and Oates-see my review).
B000002H33|5.0|Old Metallica, please come back.  Your new stuff sucks!  Your new stuff has sucked for 17 years.  I want back the Motorbreath Metallica.  I want to bang my head again, not caress myself to love songs.  If I want to listen to that, I would listen to the red hot chili peppers.
0789723107|3.0|I bought and read this book a few years ago, and when I picked it up for a second read-through last week, I realized that even though the book deals with \\"timeless\\" topics, it is starting to be a bit dated. Especially the examples and illustrations put it out of date.    The text and thoughts behind the process are still valid, but needs better reference material to be relevant for today. If you can pick it up cheap, then it is still a good read/buy though.
B000OVLBFS|5.0|I'll skip commentary on the plot or Tom Selleck. Most people have covered these very well. My perspective is production quality. Generally, television movies are merely okay when judged by music and camera work. After all, the little screen is cheaper than the big screen. The stunning production of the Jesse Stone series sets it above anything seen ever.    I would love to know the location setting. I was born and raised in MA and can't imagine a village like Paradise within commuting distance of Boston. The entire North and South Shore above and below Boston are teeming with residents so tightly packed that merely setting off to pick up milk takes resilience and cunning.I'm thinking that it's really Canada or the state of Maine.    It's the harsh and compelling scenery of the shoreline wrapping around the tiny town of Paradise that sets the appropriate mood for the brooding and iconoclastic new police chief, LA fugitive Jesse Stone. Gorgeous, sunny fall days full of spectacular, sharply displayed color recede into damp, rainy, foreboding nights full of those quietly desparate people who rarely dare to leave. The camera work is as stunning as I've ever seen out of Hollywood. One could find entertainment playing this DVD over and over even with the sound turned off.    Crank it up, though. Don't miss the poignant score artfully articulated by Jeff Beal. I hope the soundtrack will be released as well as future movies. I always play the credits that role too briefly at the end. Big screen movie credits go on interminably citing the great contribution of everyone from the executive producers to the gal that keeps the coffee fresh on set. The Jesse Stone series is just a few names at the start and the end. Still, I find it hard to shut the television off until the last note is played.    The cast is a great blend of old pros and new talent. Selleck's trademark laid back style envelopes the storyline like a perfectly broken in leather chair. Kohl Sudduth as Luther \\"Suitcase\\" Simpson, the eager young officer, moves into a favorite son roll that contrasts very well against the paternal Jesse Stone. The dispatcher is commandingly played by the amazing Viola Davis who takes her character from skeptical resentment to protective admiration swiftly and smoothly.     Saul Rubinek, the crooked but likeable banker squeezes two movies out of what is usually a throwaway roll. Rubinek may be one of those names you can't place because he's pretty much a utility actor rather than a first stringer. But he's never failed in being a notorious scene stealer in the best sense of the term. He has capacity to spare in his acting and prevents any flattening of character. The viewer roots for his comeuppance and then regrets his punishment.    The Tony D'Angelo character simmers in petty irritaion as the oldest cop at the station who's forced to play bridesmaid to every bride when the job of chief is 'stolen' from him by the incoming LA stranger Stone. Vito Rezza's expressive face and talented posturing creates an enduring tribute to the self-obsessed \\"little guy\\" steeming in his own resentments and obsessed with lame efforts to get back at the new chief.    But the real prize is the main character. There's a great deal of viewer satisfaction in seeing a powerful, confident man who, despite his own personal demons, sees crime and punishment through a complicated but common sense lens. Whether in a big city or a tiny village, he operates on his own keenly tuned intution, dispensing justice with supreme condidence. In this world of man-made conflict it is very rewarding to see a man who can un-make the troublemakers.
0385334206|5.0|I liked Breakfast of Champions; I read it over a period of 2 days after having found it lying on a desk in my English class.  Breakfast of Champions is the first Vonnegut story I've read.    I have read some of the scathing reviews here on Amazon.  Most of them chide Vonnegut's Breakfast of Champions as rude, pointless, and pretentious.  I think these people are missing the point, which is:  No matter where people go and what people experience, they bring everywhere they've been and everything they've experienced along with them.  It's the same with writing.  Every word a person writes or types is influenced by how he or she has ever felt about everything.  I applaud Vonnegut for making this concept manifest in Breakfast of Champions.  This is a book about humanity written by a human.  It's honest.  It's abrasive.  It's always beautiful.  And of course a bit of Vonnegut is going to bleed over into the story - and actually, literally, this does happen as Vonnegut gets his toe broken near the end of the novel.  If this is pretentious, we're all a bunch of a-holes.      Vonnegut is telling us through Breakfast of Champions that we can better understand ourselves by empathically seeking to understand what makes another human machine function.  That our process to better ourselves is on-going, and will never cease, even if we think we're stuck in a podunk in the middle of the midwest or some where else we think we may be stuck.  Life is a constant, sticky journey.  What's reality? -Taking care of and freeing yourself and those you love.  Simple.
B000ZN802W|4.0|Even though I thought this movie was great I still ended up angry at our main character for doing what he did to himself and his family.   It was irresponsible and selfish.  Perhaps he never intended to come out of this alive, expecting to either die from the elements or starvation.  If he did go with the intention of it just being an adventure and to return to his home soon, then it only means he was a fool, not a hero:  someone with no knowledge or sense of preparedness for life in the wild- reckless behavior, plain and simple.
0061547832|3.0|Just like the author, the book is shallow and predictable. It contains some good advice on how to approach business dealings and some tips on the effective use of attitude and posture when negotiating. The truly valuable information could probably fit on one page. The rest of the book simply expounds on how great Donald Trump is. When he says he loves to work, he means that he loves one thing in life, money. The funniest unintentional joke in the book is when Donald boasts of his sexual conquests and that he has something that women can not resist. He certainly does. It can be found in his back pocket.
B000H2MTUA|3.0|Angela's Ashes is a heartbreaking story about growing up desperately poor.  It is a story about the underside of Irish Catholicism.  It is a story of growing up in a totally dysfunctional family.  It is an easy read and captures the reader.    I question the validity of this as a memoir.  It seems too harsh and too detailed on early life experiences.  How much of this memoir consist of family stories that have been filtered by numerous retellings?  How much of is diatribe against the English and organized religion?  We will never know, but his seems to be the case.    The book is a good and worthwhile read, but I really did not feel that it is too slanted by political correctness.
0060530839|4.0|It's been years since I was assigned this book for a book report. I didn't read it but I did pass the test. Four and a half years now, I decided to read this book. I did know what to expect, but I didn't care. This book was a page-turner. It took me two nights to read this. Combined to about four hours. I enjoyed this book.    Lucy, Susan, Edmund, and Peter are moving into a professor's home during the war because of air raids. During a time of explorer, Lucy discovered a world in a wardrobe called Narnia. At first, her siblings thought they were just foolish lies. Soon, they will figure out how foolish they were to not believe and how this will be one heck of an adventure in Narnia. Unicorns, fauns, battles, an evil witch, Aslan the lion..    The rating for this book is 4/5 for a reason. This being that I disliked how C.S. Lewis gave us very long and pointless descriptions and often renamed every single creature in the world of Narnia. I constantly had to skip through those just to continue my story. Some might find it better for you to read this, but I didn't.    Overall, I think you will find this book very pleasing to read. It's a warm and freezing cold story to read. You will laugh, cry, or even fear for what's to come next for the kids.
B0004Z33G4|5.0|I was really excited when I ordered this boxset.To me its worth to get it if you don't have any other Rambo Collection already..DVDs came very well packed without any damage to the discs.Personally my favorite Rambo movie is First Blood (1982).And 1st and 3rd part has got extras which makes both of them awesome but 2nd part's dvd was little disappointment to me they could have added some extras to that movie also.But anyway its still worth having Rambo boxset for any SLY fan.Can't wait Rambo 4 to come out on DVD.
032147404X|5.0|Some may find the humor in this book a bit off.  I found it refreshing. What I especially liked is that the tips are short, sweet, and to the point. Each one is on a single page though some grow over several pages. He's done a great job with basics and some not so basics.  If you want a step by step, blow by blow technical manual then this is not for you. If you want a book that gives you techniques for better pictures and what to look for then grab this book.  I also recommend book 2 which is NOT a rehash of this one.  A welcome sight for a second book in a series.
0740748475|5.0|I just got my collection in the mail and I must say am I impressed.  I was a little bit nervous after reading so many reviews about pages falling out and the pictures on the books being glued on.  I just want to let everyone know that this is not the case.  The only place where the pictures are glued on is the outside of the case, they seem to be glued on very well but if you tried real hard I am sure you could rip them off.      Dottygal touched on this, the binding.  I may not know a lot about books but the binding appears to be sewn in.  It is not sewn into the spine, but they are all sewn together.  I am very excited about my purchase.  The layout of each strip will blow you away.  Very professional looking.  Alright well that is it, this review was meant to supplement Dottygal's just to let people know the newer editions of the books don't appear to have the same flaws as older reviewers state.
B000059H98|5.0|A lot of people really don't like this movie.  In fact it has made some of the lists of the worst movies ever made.     I totally disagree!!!  This is definitely a funky, campy, hilarious, silly, and predictable movie that is just plain fun!  When I saw it in the theater we just about fell out of our chairs because we were laughing so hard.  I believe the only reason we weren't thrown out of the theater is because everyone else was laughing and enjoying the movie just as much as we were.    I do keep putting this one in the DVD player and watching it over and over. Defintely one to put in when you want to enjoy a funny movie and don't want to think.
B000006NPY|4.0|If you listen to this album and are not at some point moved by its beauty then I feel for you because you have no soul and are completely lost forever.
B00006GO9Q|5.0|This album is simply incredible! Just take a look at the all-star list of names: Miles Davis, Wayne Shorter, John McLaughlin, Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea, Joe Zawinul, Dave Holland, and Tony Williams; a who's-who of the jazz fusion movement. There are only two tracks on this album, but they both weigh in at nearly 20 minutes each. The musicianship on this album is unbelievable, with tons of subtlety that will bring you back again and again.    This album is a great way to relax after a stressful day at work, and is a must-own for any jazz fusion fan!
B000WTLDPU|5.0|Stardust is wonderful, and deserves the HD treatment.  Sadly Blu-ray seems to have prevailed, soI will have to buy it in B when it comes out.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I recently borrowed the Persuasion DVD to watch and I loved it even more than when I caught it on PBS, which I had enjoyed immensely.  I was very surprised & dismayed to see that the PBS version had cut out several very pivotal scenes, including declarations of love past & present.    That said, Sally Hawkins and Rupert Penry-Jones were absolutely perfect in their roles, capturing quiet anguish, love, regret, strength of character.  The musical score was stirring and haunting.  The locations and costumes were magnificent and lavish.  The supporting roles of Mary, Elizabeth, and Sir Walter Elliot were excellently portrayed by the actors!  The foppishness and shallowness of Mary, the vanity, shallowness, and snobbery of Elizabeth and Sir Walter were perfection!  Even the unctuous William Elliot was well done--one can't help but cringe when he gets near.  I do agree, however, that the actress who played Elizabeth was a bit old.  And I wish that Anne Elliot weren't wearing an already-worn plain dress in the final scene.  In fact, Anne's dresses, unlike others', seemed to be cut off right above the ankles and were unflattering to her.  Anne also seemed outfitted with the flattest shoes possible, while others wore shoes or Victorian boots with a bit of heel.  I also wish her hairstyle had been softened a bit.    My favorite scene is when Anne and Captain Wentworth were first thrown together.  Anne wore a lovely dress and had a gorgeous backdrop by a window.  The heart-dropping Anne must have felt when she realized, too late, that Captain Wentworth was coming in the door.  The heart-pounding one experiences when Captain Wentworth realizes Anne is in the same room, and slowly make eye contact.     As for the final scene, yes, it wasn't very believable for the period that Anne ran all over Bath to find Captain Wentworth, and the kiss was so unflattering to Anne.  And why, oh why, didn't the production show Captain Wentworth penning his declaration of love, as in the 1995 version (which was difficult to watch because of the perceived age of the actors)?  And, until I read the reviews here, I didn't even realize the house in the final frame was Kellynch, which could not have been possible.    And even if Jane Austen hadn't written it, I kept wishing that we could have seen Anne and Frederick when they first fell in love.  The Colin Firth Pride and Prejudice was shown in three 2-hour parts on PBS(!)-- certainly, a 2-hour production of this Persuasion would have been ideal to put in more scenes and develop the characters more.
0375424474|5.0|I purchased this book to consider it as a nonfiction addition to my AP Biology class.  I am excited to offer this book to my students!  There is plenty of science to be learned through Mr. Shubin's excited tales of discovery and gentle explanation of our evolution.
B00005JLXE|4.0|Jennifer Garner actually can do this stuff...it makes you feel sorry for Ben<br />Affleck having to do fight scenes with her. The ending just isn't your  \\"Kill Bill\\" blood everywhere revenge. It is a sad story with an kind of upbeat point of view with a mystery of the Mother's necklace.<br />From a Marvel comics point of view, it is an upgrade for the second line superhero, the Daredevel, to put him in the ranks of Spiderman and Batman.<br />Ben Affleck is too gentle a fellow for this type of role and probably shouldn't have been cast for it: he is more a Gary Cooper type \\"reluctant hero\\" than the revenge crazed blind man. It needed a person who has a glow of inner torment... he did a good job anyway.
B0013BNY2Q|3.0|Okay...but have heard better from REM...audio band sound not at its best and the lyrics are ho ho...and \\"no\\" plastic protective holder...really!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|There are certainly better qualified Beatles fans to get a review from, however, I must say I am enjoying this CD.  The time I've spent listening to it is no longer markable in hours.  We are looking at days here now.  I am not entirely sure that all the #1 hits are on here but enough are for me to enjoy the whole thing.    It is also filling some gaps I have in my newly forming Beatles collection.  Some of their songs it seems aren't on the albums and this CD got them in my hands and ears.  That shows the value of the CD right there.    Very enjoyable and highly recommended.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|If you want Johnny Depp to his maximum potential then you must watch it! He is an all around actor, and everyone was brilliant down to the extras walking down the street in amazing costumes!!
B0015KO52S|5.0|I bought their first album and liked it a lot, so when I heard that they were going to release another album I was pretty excited. This album has totally blown me away. I had pretty high expectations for this album and it just blew right through those expectations and beyond. Its like they sat down and said \\"alright everyone, the last album was good, but this time we are going to go for the most awesome bluesy sound we can get\\" and this album does not disappoint. It has been a long time since I've heard an album that just made me smile all the way through it. I enjoy every song so much. I would probably need a new pair of pants if they decided to make another album.
B00003CXA6|5.0|This is one of those rare films that does justice to the event it portrays. Technically, the movie is well made and it would not be out of place to say that the photography, the music, acting and dialogue is both compelling and remarkable.        However, what makes this movie stand out are those qualities that cannot be measured. Perhaps it was the fact that most of the \\"extras\\" were actual civil war re-enactors who played their parts out of love and loyalty, perhaps because it was filmed on the actual grounds where the action occurred which, along with the Alamo, is the most hollowed ground on American soil, perhaps because as an American I realized how much I owed to every man who fought those three days - on both sides of the field - who gave \\"their last full measure of devotion\\".        I highly recommend this movie but be prepared to smile, to cry, to swell with pride, to be devasted and ultimately to be lifted up.
0307265730|5.0|There is nothing flashy about author Jhumpa Lahiri's writing. It's simply true. She writes flawlessly about secrets held close, about heartbreak and regret. At the end of each of these quiet stories, you feel an emotional wallop.<br /><br />The characters invariably include a person or persons of Indian descent -- usually a Bengali. I was unfamiliar with Indian culture when I began reading Unaccustomed Earth, but it didn't hurt my enjoyment or understanding. The stories are universal. You only need to be human to relate to the characters and their situations.<br /><br />My heart ached for these people, because I recognized them. The retired widower yearning for a new life. The silent mother hiding a broken heart. The charming brother giving in to weakness, ruining all that is good. These people could easily be my relatives, my closest of friends, or yours. Everyone has a secret to hide. Everyone regrets.<br /><br />Although the stories are often sad, they always ring true. This book is an empathetic look at what it is to be human.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Just perfect, amazing presentation of a movie every self-respecting collector should have in his library.
B000EXDS5M|5.0|One of the best and most memorable movies of the 1960s.  Redford and Newman were at the top of their form and Katharine Ross was absolutely beautiful.  George Roy Hill commented that he cast her mainly because she was the most gorgeous creature he'd ever seen.  On the short list of the most memorable endings in movie history.  The cinematography was spectacular.  Some classic lines came out of this movie:  \\"Who are those guys?\\"  \\"Rules, what rules?  There aren't any rules in a knife fight.\\"  \\"I can't swim\\".  At times hysterical:  Butch not being able to speak Spanish so he couldn't rob the bank.  Lurch getting kicked in the nuts.  The hapless employee of Mr. EH Harriman.  A definite must see.
1878424505|5.0|This book is lovely written and broken down easily.  This is a book that you can give to a child or to an elderly person.  It's very easy to read! If you're interested in living a better life this is a good way to start. The agreements have opened my eyes to see how we are; and I quote from the book \\"domesticated!\\".  I like that word because it puts into prospect how much work is needed for you to be free-minded and the author shows how you can acheive that freedom. Overall excellent book!!
B0013D8LOK|4.0|Tim Burton must have wanted to make a film adaptation of Sweeny Todd for years, it perfectly fits his dark style, certainly it comes as no surprise that he cast Depp and Carter, I keep looking for Winona Rider.  Depp really makes Todd come alive, he looks bizarre and he's crazed most of the time, but he's playing Sweeny Todd so it works.  As for Carter, she fairs much worse, her voice is grating and when she sang I had to use subtitles to understand what she was singing, all I could think of was how great Lansbury and LaPone had been in this role and how I hoped Carter would not ruin the movie for me..she did not..she of course nails the gothic look, she is after all Burtons common law wife and she dresses like that in real life as well...go figure...Sasha Cohen is great, in a small role as Todd's rival...as for Alan Rickman, lord, how many times can he play this part, he sleepwalks through the movie..zzzzz..and the      that played Todd's daughter didnt register at all, I have no idea who she was, nor do I care, but she needs acting lessons.  The film itself is beautifully stylized, it's dark and dank, but vivid.  I certainly would recommend this anyone with a passion for musical plays or somebody who really is jazzed by Burton.  It's about as perfect an adaptation of Sweeny Todd as could have been imagined, but still, it's meant to be a muscical play, set for a stage, so it can only resonate so much on film.
B0004Z33F0|1.0|Part III is so horrible in so many ways that you can't help but learn from it, but inversely and backwardly. Were people even dumber in the 80s? I think on a cultural level, without a doubt. In anycase, Rambo maybe deserves a half star as a fabulous demonstration in Right-Wing Hollywood propaganda. But today you can watch FOX News and observe how this type of propaganda is created and spread. A funny thing though is that the first RAMBO is a good movie. I love it. It is actually good, as hard as that is to remember now. Did you know that in the book (the original film is based on) Rambo's commanding officer shoots him in the head at the end?
0452289963|5.0|This book was difficult to read at first, however, if you keep going, all of the sudden it all becomes clear and you understand exactly what you were reading.  So, keep reading even if you don't think you are understanding what it says.  I found this book to bring an inner peace that I needed for a long time.  You understand who you really are and what is really important in your life.  What could be better than that?  Read with an open mind and you will find more than you will ever imagine when you are finished.

B00000G3I2|4.0|I saw \\"The Big Chill\\" for the first time when I was about 16 and considered it to be one of my favourite movies. Watching it again, more than 10 years later, I realize that the reason why I loved this film so much was because of the soundtrack (this was the film that instilled in me a love for \\"classic\\" rock and roll, especially The Rolling Stones, a love which still remains with me today). It was most certainly not for the plot or characters.     The plot centres around a group of yuppies who gather for the funeral of a college friend and then spend the weekend reminiscing about \\"the good old days\\" (this plot was, in fact, borrowed from \\"The Return of the Secaucus Seven\\", which was made three years earlier, but on a much lower budget). None of the characters in the film have a single redeeming feature and to put it bluntly, they are a group of narcissistic yuppies. Still, in a morbid kind of way, they are fascinating to watch. I don't identify with these people, I don't want to be like them, and yet, when they dance around the kitchen to old records, I find that I can't take my eyes off the screen.     After the music, the next best thing about this film is the cast. Just about every actor in this film went on to bigger and better things (even Kevin Costner, who is the corpse that you see in the opening scene).     Overall, the film is worth seeing, if only to say that you have seen what is often considered to be a minor classic, and after you've seen it, go out and buy the soundtrack.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|I watched this dvd last night, and it was very enjoyable, in my opinion. It supposed to be a comedy, but it is more like a drama where Will Ferrell's character, Harold, tries to find out who's the voice narrating in his head and try to find her with the help of a literature professor (Dustin Hoffman) before his \\"imminent death\\" while the morbid author Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson) trying to figure out how to kill Harold (unknowning that he's real) with the help of her assistant played by Queen Latifah.<br /><br />The cast of this film delivers an excellent story about illusions, love, and a journey to discovery. Personally, I really enjoyed this film.
0312379293|4.0|What do you get if you mix up a good portion of Archer's works together and toss them into something new?  A Prisoner of Birth is a pretty good idea of what happens.    Archer fans can see a lot of his previous characters in Danny Cartright, who is sentenced for a crime he didn't commit.  Set free and in new circumstances by fate and the admiration of men who believe he's innocent, he suddenly is forced to fight a battle against the unjust on two fronts.  He doesn't seek revenge or vengeance as much as poetic justice - and all within the letter, if not the spirit, of the law.
B000SSGUEO|2.0|Got it, heard it, threw it out. I suggest you do the same, unless, of course, you want to continue to listen to the circus called Deep Purple.<br />I will not go into a lengthy explanation of what I mean.<br />Only one point. The remaster is poor. Paice's drums sound like cardboard.<br />The people who submitted all those glorious reviews are obviously not musicians. I am, therefore the next destination of these CDs is a trash bin.
B00132D808|2.0|I loved Panic!'s first effort, it was strange, fun experimental, and I was hooked after hearing their first effort. I did not know that there was a new Panic! album, so I bought it today off of iTunes, because, well, it's Panic! At The Disco's second album. But man was I incredibly dissapointed when I heard it. It sounds like they decided to take the lamest track off of Fever (Nails for Breakfast, Tacks For Snacks) and decided to make an entire album that sounds exactly like it. Not even the bonus track that came with the iTunes version was good. We get lame songs like \\"She's a Handsome Woman\\" and \\" The Green Gentleman\\". All the songs sound exactly the same, with the exception of \\"I Have Friends in Holy Spaces\\" and \\"The Piano Knows Something I Don't Know\\", which sounds like a mix of \\"I Write Sins...\\" and \\"...But it's Better If You Do\\", but shorter.<br /><br />Overall, skip it. A pretty wierd and depressing one for me.
B000BNI90O|4.0|I listened to the recordings straight through. I enjoyed the music, and found the many returns to the primary musical themes very emotional.  But I have to admit that I could only listen to the recordings as background music.  These are not pieces that sustain my interest.  Now, granted, my attention span is not long these days, but I guess I'd hoped to be so moved by the music that I could allow my whole self to simply listen.  That didn't happen.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|This is without a doubt the best film I have seen starring Bill Murray.  It has a powerful combination of great writing, a wonderful cast, and even a lesson to learn.  It also has a nice combination of comedy and romance, so that neither are neglected.  Bill Murray is phenomenal!  He starts out this shallow shell, and undergoes character development and change, but it is gradual and believable.  Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliot were great choices for supporting characters.
B000O5AYCA|4.0|The National really grabbed my attention with this latest release.  Upon initial listens only a few tracks stuck out to me, but something kept me coming back for more.  Perhaps it was the production by Peter Katis (whom also works with Interpol); or the very well written lyrics; or just the singer's somber baritone.  Whatever it was, Boxer really opened up upon repeated listens.  This is the best album I've heard in quite some time.  Most of the tunes flow along effortlessly to a mellow vibe.  The songs are very well arranged and very well performed.  Somewhat dark, somewhat pensive, yet refreshing and comforting in a strange way.  You're sure to find yourself singing these songs in your head after a few spins.  I'd also recommend picking up the single, Mistaken For Strangers.  The two b-sides on it are excellent, even if the price tag is a little hefty.
1400063515|3.0|The book presents in many different ways to dangers and impossibility of predictions using the usual methods. It also comments on the fallacies of grouping and organisation using such approaches. While the basic arguement is fine and the supporting cognitive examples are fine, the continued expression of unjustified prejudice and insulting comments about different races and professions is both unnecessary and dissapointing. I would look for a short summary written in an appropriate manner rather than wade through his long and repeated explanations interspersed with biased asides.
B00139B39E|4.0|This unexpected CD serves it purpose to new fans of Dream Theater. It's got a good collection of songs ranging from all the styles that Dream Theater are known to play. I don't know if the \\"diehard\\" fans notice this or not, but Dream Theater's fanbase now far extends what it used to be. That is, people who really liked \\"Images and Words\\" and \\"Awake\\" enough to stick around and see what else the band was up too. Therefore, a collection was necessary for the newer fans to be caught up to speed.<br /><br />There's not much here for longtime fans, though. Nobody wants to hear radioedits, and though the remixes of the \\"Images and Words\\" tunes are cool, as well as the inclusion of \\"To Live Forever\\", it seems to make more sense for the longtime fans to pay a few bucks and download those of off iTunes.<br /><br />The longtime fans will criticize this one for the edits and the playlist, but I don't think that will keep this collection from winning over newer fans. After all, \\"highlights\\" was my first Yes CD, and I fell in love with the band afterwards.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|I have a great love of Jane Austen and especially Pride and Prejudice, but I don't like this adaptation. For me, it is simply far too rushed and incomplete to do justice to the great novel. To draw audiences into the wonderful romance of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, a film has to be well-paced to allow for their character development and their witty bantering, to draw you into their love story, and to see the changes that take place as the two of them recognize their own shortcomings. I just didn't think this film succeeded in that way, so it didn't move me romantically. Plus, the actors spoke so softly and muffled it was almost impossible to understand them, and the whole film came across as dark in color, rather than the brightness and beauty that I associate with Austen.    I didn't think this film truly captured the wit and humor or told the story fully enough. The pacing was bizarre, and I wouldn't have even been able to really follow it or \\"get\\" the storyline at all if I hadn't already known it well before I watched this movie.    I  must admit: Although I've since read and loved the book, I was first introduced to Pride and Prejudice through the incredible 1995 BBC/A&E miniseries (with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle) when it was first shown  here in the U.S. I absolutely fell in love with it. That adaptation is a complete delight, and it faithfully portrays the novel in so much depth, that it possibly affected how I looked at this version. On the other hand, if I had seen only THIS movie as my P&P introduction, I probably would never have even wanted to read the book. It's certainly possible to love more than one adaptation of a book, which I do with Little Women and some others; I'm not usually a \\"purist\\" about these kinds of things. But this is how I feel about this particular movie. It just didn't work for me at all.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|Great movie that touches each viewer differently.  The sexual realism is only shocking for the first minute as it IS different from the norm.  It fits with the story and isn't distracting at all after that first bit.  Sweet without being sappy.  Hopefully, there will be a sequel.
B000BW7QX6|5.0|What a shame that tv producers did not see the charm in this shoot em up, sci fi original with such wonderful characters.  From the first episode to the last, you just want to see more.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! PERFECT! Quintin Tarantino does it again. YOU will LOVE THIS MOVIE. Guaranteed to make you and you friends Yell \\"YEAH!\\" at the end and feel pumped and ready to burn rubber after.   Part 2 of the GRINDHOUSE feature selection, TARANTINO nods to alot of his past movies through his directorial contribution to the \\"double feature of raw raunchy\\". Signature TARANTINO: GREAT music (hand selected of course), unforgettable dialogs and conversation between characters, and unadulterated  raw action that is adrenaline pumping maddness. With the touch of a true master, Tarantino has a kind of \\"feel\\" and style to his movies that is so well played out in this film. CHECK IT OUT!!! YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY!    (oh, and totally check out Robert Rodriguez's TERROR PLANET which is part 1 of the Grindhouse Double feature. TOTALLY AWESOME! And Quentin is in it! Compliments the similarities and distinctive differences between two of the most influential and talented directors of our time!)
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|One of the best movies I've ever seen.  Keira Knightley is magical.  The family unit is so well depicted in this movie, that it makes you feel you were there.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who is enchanted by yesteryear or Jane Austen.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|ONE OF MY FAVORITE SHOWS EVER!  In the tradition of FREAKS AND GEEKS, and THE WONDER YEARS, this \\"coming of age\\" show is one of the funniest and relatable shows ever. We've all done, (or are doing) the ackward stage that is Adolesence. This show will make you take a fond trip down memory lane. Even if you're only 25 like me! =)  Everyones had a \\"Jordan Catalano\\" and a \\"Brian Cackow\\" and friends you shouldn't and dealt with being different or pushing the line.     If your looking for a great show to really sit and enjoy, (and best with a friend) then MY SO CALLED LIFE  is the one for you. You wont be sorry!
B000002LEM|3.0|OU812 released in 1988, is Van Halen's second record with Sammy Hagar and is without a doubt their weakest with the Red Rocker, the songs here differ so much from one sound to the next, while some fans adore OU812 I think they could have done just a little better for their sophmore effort. With this release Van Halen hoped they would erase many fans distaste with the band over the whole Diamond Dave fiasco, sure this was preceded by 5150, but that record was all but written and Hagar just sort of lent his pipes to finish the process, OU812 marks his first full effort with the band and in some spots it shines bright, but other places it's like a dark crevis that has not seen the light in years. The title of this record is supposedly a shot fired in the direction of David Lee Roth for the title of his record Eat Em' And Smile, but if thats what Van Halen intended I would have certainly buffed up the rock and cut back on the lite radio hits.<br /><br />1. Mine All Mine 8-10 Most Van Halen openers are usually pretty solid tracks, especially during the Sammy years, Good Enough, Poundcake and Seventh Seal all hold that distinction as great openers, but this song lacks in a big way and seems rushed and thrown together, nothing special about this song.<br /><br />2. When It's Love 10-10 Probably the biggest and most known hit off this record, it's a very catchy power ballad that was typical during the 80's and while Sammy was at the helm. Very catchy and really good harmonies on the chorus, overall great song.<br /><br />3. AFU (Naturally Wired) 8-10 Another song that rocks, but lacks that typical Van Halen knockout punch, this song just does not the peak I believe they intended it to.<br /><br />4. Cabo Wabo 10-10 Here is another highlight from this record, Cabo Wabo has an infectous chorus and party rock lyrics, and to this day is a fan favorite, depending on who is the lead singer of course.<br /><br />5. Source Of Infection 8-10 Yet another song that just does not get off the ground, I don't know if the guys rushed just to get this record out on the shelves or they just did'nt care by this point.<br /><br />6. Feels So Good 10-10 This song could have been played on your moms favorite music station, it's a very light type of ballad and has very catchy lyrics and chorus, another album highlight.<br /><br />7. Finish What Ya Started 10-10 My absolute favorite track off the record, and has an overall very different sound than most Van Halen songs, reaches for more of an acoustic feel and Eddie kill with the guitar riff.<br /><br />8. Black And Blue 10-10 Slow paced rocker that seems to carry the effects of the rest of the album, it's a very good song with a great chorus, but everything on this album seems so drull and grey. This song is a great song though.<br /><br />9. Sucker In A 3 Piece 8-10 Good fast paced rocker that keeps the flow of the record moving nicely, kinda long at almost 6 minutes though and it looses me after a while.<br /><br />10. A Apolitical Blues 5-10 This might be the worst song Van Halen ever recorded with Sammy Hagar, this is a cover of a blues song and I just don't see what attracted the guys to this song. Definately this was a weak way to end the album and this song is why I question if they were rushed to get this album out for some reason.<br /><br />OU812 is definately the weakest and least favorite Van Halen record with my main man Sammy Hagar it still got some great Van Halen songs on it, but it just does'nt have the same vibe as other Van Halen records with Sammy. If keeping score at home boys and girls this is the fourth best record with Hagar on it, and since they only recorded four with him that sums up where this album sits in my mind. LONG LIVE VAN HALEN!!!rushed just to get this record out on the shelves or they just did'nt care by this point.    6. Feels So Good 10-10 This song could have been played on your moms favorite music station, it's a very light type of ballad and has very catchy lyrics and chorus, another album highlight.    7.

B00003CWPL|4.0|Eraser head is a brilliant  film that was the start of an amazing director, David Lynch!    Totally dark, and innovative in the use of graphics and special effects, it is a must see for any Lynch fan. BEWARE: this film is not for everyone. Lynch can be an acquired taste, and (as a Twin Peaks nod) this is one of his DARKEST ROASTS! If you are just getting started on Lynch films or his collection, I think WILD AT HEART or even BLUE VELVET is a safer start. But don't forget about ERASER HEAD. This film is a potent intoxicating elixir of a film that totally deserves to be appreciated by the few of the audience that truly  can!
0743486285|4.0|Much like a movie that continues to linger in the minds of the viewers for days, Heroin Diaries grips you from the first page and refuses to let go.    The diary entries in this book haunted me for days.  Sixx's use of words and prose, even in the midst of depression and drug-induced paranoia, is eloquent and rivetting.  As much as I detested and was horrified by the actions of the author as described in his diary entries, I found myself longing for resolution and health for him (it amazes me how this is so relative - readers will find themselves \\"rooting\\" for the person whose actions and thoughts were so vile).    I would recommend this book for those who enjoy biographical literature, although would caution younger readers for explicit and sexual content and language.  Illustrations are graphic and appropriately bolster the content.    After reading this book, I also recommend the accompanying soundtrack by Sixx AM.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I watched Dexter, and IMMEDIATELY LOVED IT!!! Totally addictive. If your looking for a suspenseful, WELL WRITTEN,dark, (but sometimes darkly comedic) show to get hooked on...be prepared...your going to be dead to the world for about a week or however long it takes you to watch the whole season. I lent it to my best friend so she and her boyfriend could check it out! They finished it in 5 days, and she said she couldn't believe she had NEVER seen it. Totally a must have for anyone!!!
0307275639|5.0|This book was so much more than i expected. Mitch Albom portrayed Morrie absolutely beautifully. This story was touching seeing an old student reunited with an influential professor. The lessons Morrie teaches are unforgettable and can adapted to any person in any life. The book almost offers a guidance through your life and through the past. In the present it helps to make you see the world in  completely different light. The book opens your eyes to a world that is completely beautiful and less harsh than the world that appears. In the past it offers a look back an evaluation of events. For me this book gave closure to many life situations that i know i will face. This was absolutely an epic book that will forever be remembered by those who read it.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|This 2004 film reflects amazing visual invention, and first-time writer/director Kerry Conran, self-professed computer geek, has fashioned something remarkably singular from his fertile imagination, his obviously encyclopedic knowledge of pre-WWII popular culture, and most of all, his technological savvy. What he has created is impressive - a self-contained world of startling images that seem simultaneously futuristic and retro in a colorized black-and-white world bathed in diffuse lighting and stylized art deco designs. Moving like a speeding train, the plot is stuffed with so many references to other classic stories and movies it often gets overwhelming, and I have to admit some of the turns get very convoluted as a result. As a pop culture junkie myself, I see tributes to George Pal's [[ASIN:B000AOEMWS The War of the Worlds]], Ray Harryhausen's special effects in [[ASIN:0767810864 Jason and the Argonauts]], Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's [[ASIN:B000SAGGL4 The Lost World]], James Hilton's [[ASIN:B00093099U Lost Horizon]], Aldous Huxley's [[ASIN:0060850523 Brave New World]], Steven Spielberg's [[ASIN:B00003CXC5 Indiana Jones]] trilogy and \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\", George Lucas' [[ASIN:B000FQJAIW Star Wars]] especially in the aerial chase scenes, and the stiff upper lip of British WWII films.<br /><br />That's a lot of references for a 103-minute film, sometimes too much, but Conran does a mostly smart job of spinning his plates into a truly exciting film. Beyond that, it amazes me that most of the action was done against a green screen, as the people and images seamlessly meld together. There are incredible sequences involving gigantic robots trampling New York, fanciful aerial air strips with dozens of fighter planes, swarms of automated winged weapons among others, and they are sequenced at a lightning-fast pace. The actors are well cast, though the best compliment one can pay them is that they don't get in the way of the action. In fact, their relative nonchalance to the extraordinary things going on around them is a major part of the fun. Jude Law cuts a dashing figure as the nominal hero, although he seems too lightweight and frankly a bit too earnest to be truly memorable. Gwyneth Paltrow plays the obligatory Lois Lane part, aptly named Polly Perkins, with a saucy mix of Veronica Lake's peek-a-boo allure (I love the skirt slitting shot) and Barbara Stanwyck's tough-dame savvy.<br /><br />In an all-too-brief part late in the film, Angelina Jolie is wonderfully gutsy as a veddy British naval captain, finally able to use her striking looks (not to mention her arresting eyepatch) to great effect. Not every actress can get away with a line like \\"Alert the amphibious squad!\\". In smaller roles, Giovanni Ribisi as the bubblegum-chewing Dex and British comedian Omid Djalili as Vienna sausage-loving Kaji seem to function purely as plot devices to move the story along. Conran understandably uses characters as chess pieces because the visual elements are what make this story percolate. I only wish Conran could have simplified the story a bit to let us absorb more of what's going on. I felt a little out of breath every time the locale changed since I wasn't sure I grasped everything I needed to know up to that point. I also think it's a bit of a conceit to \\"cast\\" the late Laurence Olivier as the primary villain since it feeds into one of the final plot twists.<br /><br />The 2005 Special Collector's Edition DVD boasts some significant extras starting with two separate commentary tracks - the first from producer Jon Avnet and the second from Conran and the special effects crew. I found there was not enough distinction between the two tracks, but both discuss the complexity of the production in thorough detail. There is a behind-the-scenes documentary, \\"Brave New World\\", which runs nearly an hour and shows the startling green screen process. The film was shot on just one soundstage even though the story travels around the world.Two shorts are also included - one focused on the costumes and production design by the director's brother Kevin and the other the six-minute demo made to give studio executives a preview of the final film. Deleted/extended scenes and a gag reel round out the extras.luded - one focused on the costumes and production design by the director's brother Kevin and the other the six-minute demo made to give studio executives a preview of the final film.

0757302661|5.0|I recommend this book to every mom-to-be I meet. It is sad that some reviewers did not give it the full credit it deserves...especially since at least one of them never even gave birth before, and suggested reading 3+ books rather than this one very informative one! I gave birth to my daughter at home a year and a half ago using the techniques given in this book. I never took a class, but was very disciplined at practicing the meditations on my own every night. Birthing is no simple task, but this book will give you the tools and confidence you need to get through it.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|As a fan of Stargate SG-1 and Atlantis I enjoyed \\"The Ark of Truth\\". It picked up where SG-1 Season 10 left off and answered some questions such as Are the Ori dead or what? The production value is high quality and makes it feel more like a movie than a two hour TV episode. The soundtrack is more orchestral, the locations are bigger and the special effects are better than the TV series. I also like how it left the ending wide open for more adventures. I'll look forward to the next movie \\"Continuum\\" and Atlantis Season 5.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|\\"Pure being,\\" a friend of mine once said enviously of the surfers riding the waves along the Southern California coast some thirty years ago.  Though there was a strict demarcation between the gay section of the beaches and those parts that belonged to the surfers alone, even then a few surfers hung out at night in the Breakers or one of the other gay bars along Highway One, especially in Laguna. There, what seemed so easy a life out in the Pacific, just following the next big waves one after another, became less obvious and more conflicted.  Stories about coming out have so dominated many gay films that the theme has developed into an archetype, a genre of its own with endless variations:  from dark into light, from secrets into revelation.  In Shelter, Zach is a young artist who has turned down a scholarship at CalArts in order to stay home to care for his nephew Cody.  Zach has inherited the family gene, from his mother he says.  All the concerns and nearly all the love the five year old Cody should find in his mother, Zach's sister Jeanne, he gets from Zach alone.  Zach has had a long time girlfriend, but everything about their relationship is tentative, on hold.  When he meets his best friend's older brother again after several years, they surf together, just as they used to.  But Shaun is an openly gay man who has published a novel which Zach has read.  Shaun's sexuality is no secret to Zach, but Zach's is to Shaun--as it may still be to Zach himself, at least in the sense that he has never before been with a man (or in all likelihood a woman; his responses to his girlfriend are mostly tepid, except when his real longings frighten him).  What Zach wants more than anything are family and love.  After a night during which he and Shaun kiss, Zach is happy but its meaning is still uncertain.  He rides the waves, paces the deck of the house he shares with his sister and nephew in what he calls San Pedro's ghetto, then drives back to the family house on the beach where Shaun is staying to recuperate emotionally after a boyfriend has dumped him in L.A.  What follows between Zach and Shaun is stunning in its impact upon both men.  Their coupling, however, is not filmed as soft core porn, all or nearly all about the physical alone, but as love scenes.  What matters most is the feeling shown through their eyes.  All the acting in this emotionally profound film is superb, but the love beyond words Zach and Shaun manage to express just with their eyes has almost never before been seen in movies, not even, say, in Brokeback where to some degree it was often having to be hidden by one or the other man.  What follows in Shelter is Zach's coming to understand what that love means to him for the rest of his life.  Part of this is the usual problem of coming out to his friends and to his sister, though nearly all that effort is accomplished for him; they know before he tells them. But he must also come to see himself better; he must change, too, as he tells Shaun later.  Part of that transformation is his discovering more fully who Shaun is.  Shaun has been criticized by some viewers for being too patient with Zach.  But patience is part of love, one of the virtues that help people abide all the messes we make or almost make out of our lives.   When Zach learns that Shaun has mailed his application and portfolio to CalArts, he sees, quietly, the man's generosity.  In a way, Shaun has shown that he loves Zach as kindly and patiently as Zach loves Cody.  Zach's and Shaun's erotic communion is intense.  But this is a love that is also caritas, deep, perhaps abiding.  It is his recognition of that possibiity, if not certainty that leads Zach back to Shaun, especially after a talk with his girlfriend in which he says his only regret (about being gay) is that he wanted to make a family with her.  In this moment between them, it is her goodness which allows her to encourage Zach to return to Shaun, to the different family he might find now through Shaun and with Cody.  At least, she says, he should try.  Near the end, after Zach and Shaun drive to the house to pick up Cody from Zach's sister who is moving to Portland with her rough boyfriend, Zach turns to Shaun and takes his hand in his.  It is a gesture of love between them as telling as any more passionate embrace.  The seemingly unencumbered lives both men had known together surfing when younger--Shaun the master, Zach the pupil in a running joke between them--has grown into a love that is in every sense good.  I think this is one of the best movies ever made about gay men, searchingly decent and generously spirited about love without any loss in erotic force.  It is also wonderfully realized, except in a few of the songs on the soundtrack, in both the director's eye and the hearts of all the performers, even those in relatively minor roles (Gabe is as perfect a surfer dude as one can imagine, but with more than the usual soul).   But Trevor Wright as Zach gives to his character an especially touching complexity.  Zach is in some ways still a kid, talking in the lingo of surfers, tagging buildings, riding his skateboard.  But he's also emotionally older than everyone else in his life, already committed to a way of living many people never come to.  His coming out is more painful to himself than it is to others perhaps because his need for real communion is already so great. Yet he finds it.  This is emotionally complex work for so young an actor.  But every gesture he makes, everything he expresses is true; no moment ever feels false or contrived.  What the movie leaves one with is a sense of both the hopes and ambiguities of moral being, a far more difficult, yet greater life than merely riding the waves of one's youth.
B000059GEH|5.0|I've noticed how there seem to be a lot more people disagreeing with the positive reviews given HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE then agreeing.  I'm surprised.<br /><br />It certainly will never get confused as a Pulitzer contender but taken as it is - a time capsule snapshot of late 40's/ early 50's America and the American Dream - it is quite accurate, on point, and down right funny.<br /><br />The three women work wonderfully well together.  Grable was the 20th Century Fox star; Bacall had the panache; Monroe was the up and coming one that everybody was talking about - and what should have turned into a diva-fight mess resulted in a laugh filled movie.<br /><br />The whole concept is dated but let's face it - we are talking about a movie made 60 years ago!  People have all dutifully noted that (and the slap it gives to women's lib) but no one has recorded that the movie is fun - pure, plain and simple.  Some of the lines are witty and there are enough inside jokes to make it an instant classic.<br /><br />Watch it with an open mind and don't look for deep messages - just have fun with it - the cast certainly did and that is what makes this an enjoyable film.
B0011ZNAIC|2.0|(...sorry for the pun.)<br /><br />In any movie you should expect to suspend your belief on certain areas - however, when a movie asks you to do this too much, it fails.  Bee Movie is a good example of this.<br /><br />When you start watching the film, you are expected to suspend belief on how bees work.  In the movie, it's a given that bees drive cars, wear clothes, use machinery - in essence, the bees are tiny humans.  Okay, I can buy this.<br /><br />Humans have never noticed what the bees are doing, and despite the fact that both bees and humans speak English, there's been no, and I mean NO communication between the two species ever, before the events in this movie.  The reason for this - it's an unspoken law that bees should not talk to humans, and humans are apparently too stupid to notice the strange habits of the bees.  Okay, that's stretching it and the whole 'unspoken rule' thing is becoming very hackneyed, but I can buy that for the sake of enjoying the film.<br /><br />*SPOILERS*<br /><br />The movie really starts to fall apart when it challenges basic physics and biology.  For instance, in the movie, pollen is more like water than pollen.  The plants in the movie NEED pollination or they'll all die.  And I mean die immediately, not just through failure to reproduce.  Within days of suspending honey production, the entire park the bees live in is dying, because they are no longer pollinating it.  Even plants that don't rely on insect pollination are dying, for some strange reason.<br /><br />To add to all of this, apparently in the film any type of pollen can pollinate any type of plant.  At the beginning of the movie, I snorted at the pollen jock who was sprinkling daisy pollen on roses, thinking 'yeah, that'll help the rose!'  Little did I know, this biological inaccuracy would be involved in a major plot point at the film's climax.<br /><br />Another place where the film crosses the 'suspension of belief' line is when a bunch of bees lift up a plane and keep it from crashing.  Yeah, I really did just say that.  Let's do some math - a fully loaded Boeing 777 is going to weigh around 340,194 kilograms.  A bee weighs, on average, 10 milligrams, and can carry a payload of about 55 milligrams.  In order to lift that plane, you would need about 6.2 BILLION bees.  The average hive has about 50,000 bees, so you would need to round up all the bees in about 123,000 hives in order to lift a plane.  And this is just theoretically - I doubt the plane has enough surface area to accommodate all those bees.<br /><br />*END SPOILERS*<br /><br />Those are the two major events/concepts that took a flying leap over the line, but a bunch of little things annoyed me as well.  In fact, by the end of the film, the director apparently just tossed reality out the window.  I could almost envision him saying 'bear with us, I know this won't make any sense AT ALL but we need to get to this next scene somehow.'<br /><br />Plotwise, the movie meanders about, never seeming to find a good end goal to latch onto.  Act 1 is completely different from Act 2, which is completely different from Act 3, which made everything feel disjointed and frankly, a little sloppy.  The ending message of the film says to me - status quo is good, doing things differently will get you in trouble, so don't break the rules.  Which is to me, a strange message for a children's film.  One that goes directly against Dreamworks' earlier bug production, Antz.<br /><br />The dialogue for the most part is bland - there's a few one liners or bits of dialogue exchange that might elicit a chuckle, but don't expect to be rolling on the floor laughing.<br /><br />The characters are inoffensively cute, and the animation and modeling are so-so compared to Dreamworks' earlier efforts, really making the title of the movie appropriate; because as far as that's concerned, this is a B movie.  The cast is all star, but generally not used to its potential, with the exception of Seinfeld.Chris Rock's short appearance in particular will be disappointing to his fans.<br /><br />All in all, I thought the film had potential, but the decision to include some really stunningly stupid logic, and the lack of a cohesive plot wrecked it for me.  If you have a really, really high tolerance for such things, you might be able to get some enjoyment out of this, but otherwise, I recommend steering clear of Bee Movie.l, I thought the film had potential, but the decision to include some really stunningly stupid logic, and the lack of a cohesive plot wrecked it for me.

B000ERU5EK|5.0|These guys throw a ton of vocals into their stuff, which isn't characteristic of trance; however, I'm not gonna be a \\"purist\\" on this one, because they do it so well.  I really like this one.  \\"Can't sleep\\", \\"good for me\\", and \\"home\\" are just brilliant.  I have no idea what \\"good for me\\" would be under, but it's beautiful.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I was already extremely happy with the Sixaxis controller, but I could not resist getting the DualShock 3. Not only do you get the rumble, but also, it feels much better in your hands, even for those games that do not use this feature. The rumble function is fun, but on top of that, it helps with gameplay, because \\"feeling\\" what is happening provides a lot more feedback than just watching how your character or car reacts to the environment.<br /><br />The biggest surprise of all was that the rumble works with PS 2 games in the PS 3 system. I am currently playing through \\"God of War\\", a game which had the rumble capability in PS 2. I thought that it was unlikely that I was going to get this feature with this new controller in the PS 3, but it worked perfectly.<br /><br />I know that having to buy a new controller and basically discard the one that came with the system is not the ideal situation, but I have to say this product is really worth shedding the extra bucks.
0790729350|1.0|As a non-drug user who remembers the concert, saw the theatrical version of the film in 1970, and has worn out records and tapes of the music, I was hoping to relive the visual experiences of the concert when I purchased this dvd.  Unfortunately, the Director's Cut has butchered the original film.  Scenes and performances have been altered, all for the worse.  This dvd will sit on the shelf, and I will continue to listen to the cd.  The Director's cut is revisionist at best.<br /><br />Update--1 July 2008: If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews.  My goal is to provide help to potential buyers, not get into any arguments.  So, if you only disagree with my opinion, could you please say so in the comments and not indicate that the review was not helpful.  Thanks.
B00005JNX0|5.0|My grandchildren watch this movie all the time.  My husband and I also love it.  The penquins steal the show and the catchy phrase \\"just smile and wave boys\\" seems to fit on some crazy, stress filled days.  I think more movies like this should be made.  Violent cartoons, senseless shows should be banned.  Entertain the children with animated, messages of comraderie, love of nature and openness to all people.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|I'm someone who is mostly stuck in 70's music - but these guys remind me of the great 70's bands with their own style and energy.  Not so long ago a local radio station that plays mostly 70's and 80's songs played \\"Otherside\\" a few times, and I thought: damn, who are these guys? After listening to their to their body of work, I was hooked.  This video is a great live summary of their work up to '03.  Buy it.
0446528056|3.0|Nicholas Sparks, takes the reader deep into the depths of the human heart with DEAR JOHN. The strongest contrast in characterization is Savannah Lynn Curtis, who constantly exhibits intuition and strength of purpose, but emotionally is drained by separation. I was delighted to discover a southern novel that used war and responsibility instead of religion to bring about change and growth in the narrator. A Sparks story that is stark in contrast.<br />Perfect to take to the beach.<br />Nash Black, author of WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and SINS OF THE FATHERS.
B00005JPTK|5.0|This movie was way better than I thought it would be. Will Smith put on some great acting in this film.  Portraying the psyche of the last man on earth he did a great job.  Trying to keep a routine to keep himself sane.  Still holding out hope that there are people out there by going to the dock everyday and broadcasting a message over the air.  The movie really paid attention to detail.  The second storyline about his family fit too and even the darkstalkers were portrayed well.  I was expecting a zombie type movie but this was not the case. I have not seen the previous two versions but I venture to say that they could not have been better than this one.
B00008NRL8|5.0|....and you're dancing close to the most amazing partner...bodies one...breathing in unison...sliding your leg along your sexy partner's leg....  There isn't anything about this music that is short of sensual and erotic...you can almost feel their hand sliding gently down your neck.......    Reality now hits...urban, gently pulsing, sophisticated, character, soulful, reminiscent, erotic, and sensual are all words to describe this album....      I first heard Santa Maria a few years ago and finally found the artist and album...it does not disappoint!
B00005S6K8|4.0|Love this movie and have almost memorized it.  The ugly duckling meets teh rich, proud, son whom she never felt a thing for.  The handsome younger brother who is flightly and useless most of the time.  What a family of misfits.  Money does not always buy happiness.  Do watch and curl up with a blanket and cup of tea.  Sweet and romantic.
B000002A3T|4.0|If you just get over the fact that Roger was not there in 1994, you can relax and really appreciate this one.  Certain cuts on this album are still on my active playlist.  \\"High Hopes\\" is among the BEST songs ever on a Pink Floyd album, period.  Listen to it a few times and you will be hooked.  It's right up there with \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"Welcome to the Machine\\".  As a whole, \\"The Division Bell\\" is not equal to \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" or \\"Wish You Were Here\\", but is excellent nonetheless - highly recommended!
B00005K3O4|4.0|What fun this movie is! A wonderful, imaginative spoof of the 50s creature movies, namely \\"The Blob\\", this is much more comedy than horror.    Who doesn't think clowns are creepy? These clowns, however (which are actually aliens) are too funny-looking to be creepy. I couldn't help but laugh every time one of them appeared. Especially the one dubbed \\"Fatso\\", who's a big, waddling blob of clown. The plot is pretty simple: a tent-shaped spaceship lands in a town one night, letting loose a group of silly-looking alien clowns that feed on the citizens. Actually, they turn them into cotton candy and store them on board their space ship for future consumption. The requisite teenage couple stumbles upon these happenings and become the heroes of the movie, along with a cop who conveniently used to date our heroine.     The DVD is filled with fun extras, including commentary by the trio of Chiodo brothers who wrote, produced, and directed the film. Also featured are spots on how the special effects, music, and other things were done, so you get a mini lesson in filmmaking also.    If you love cult or campy movies, you can't miss this one!
6305546789|5.0|I have yet to find a movie that instilled as much fear in me as the orginal story of Michael Myers.  This movie is not about the gore snf blood we so often see in movies these days, yet, it scares you to the core.  Michael Myers is more than just a killer, he is a fear that stays inside you.  Run all you want, he will walk and he will find you.  You can't overcome his strength.  This movie will make you look behind you to make sure nobody is following you, and trust me, you will not want to be in your home alone after watching this.  This is a classic and will always be.  By Far the best horror movie ever
B000R7I3LY|5.0|Lots of reviews for this album here, but what it comes down to is this. The songs rock...Sara's got a knack for lyrics, she can flat-out sing (the high note she nails in the bridge for Come Back Soon raised the hairs on my arms), the songs have clever arrangements, and the whole thing ties itself up into a ridiculously good album that I was surprised to absolutely love. \\"Morningside\\" is a freight train of a pop song, with a killer beat that every so often relaxes for just a measure or two and then thumps back when it's not expected, and \\"Love On The Rocks\\" is brilliantly written with sublime harmonies. Towards the end, there's a point where the harmony lines vamp down with Sara's lead, but keep following where you'd expect them to drop, and it's just the sexiest thing ever. \\"One Sweet Love\\" and \\"Gravity\\" are beautiful ballads. If there's a weak song, it's \\"Fairytale\\", just because it comes off a little too centered in the gimmick, but still, it's cleverly written and you can't blame her for having it on the CD. Love it all. Can't wait for the next one.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Clear the decks on Monday nights on CBS at 8:00 EST.  You will not regret it.  Okay, I absolutely love this show.  It is the funniest thing I have ever seen on television.  Every episode is a little gem.  The writing is bright and hilarious and the acting and casting are superb.  I cannot remember any new sitcom that I have ever watched that hit the ground running like this one did or where the cast jelled so quickly as a tight ensemble.  I had almost completely sworn off network television sitcoms after those halcyon days of Seinfeld had finally passed.  (May you rest in peace, beloved characters Jerry, George, Elaine, Kramer, and \\"Newmie.\\")  Then a friend told me about this hilarious new sitcom, THE BIG BANG THEORY, about two science geeks named Sheldon and Leonard.  When I finally got around to watching the show at the third episode, I was astounded at how unbelievably funny this show actually was.  The writing was smart and creative and the acting and comic timing were simply superb.  Amazingly, the cast seemed to hit the ground running and immediately was a cohesive ensemble from the very first episode (which I got to see later in reruns).  Even the supporting cast choices were inspired, such as Sara Gilbert for the uber utilitarian and throroughly heartless brain girl (\\"Leslie Winkle), Laurie Metcaf as Sheldon's no-nonsense east Texas mother (\\"Mrs. Mary Cooper\\"), and that great character actor who played \\"Ray-Ray\\" on \\"My Name Is Earl\\" as Sheldon's fictitious cousin fresh out of non-existent substance abuse rehab (\\"Leopold Houston\\").  Everybody involved in this show--from the writers, directors, actors, set and costume designers, etc.)--have created a wonderful little world where you feel you are watching the actual lives of real people you know and care about.  The writers are true masters of characterization and, as is the case with pulling off a great con, the secret is in the details.  I love how references to things like Howard's allergy to peanuts, Koothrapalli's phobia about talking to women, Sheldon's anal retentive obsession with labeling everything,and Leonard being lactose intolerant keep popping up in the episodes.  And, the final test for me for rating the greatness of  a sitcom is is how many of the tag lines (great one-liners) I incorporate into my own conversation.  I find a lot of lines from the show keep popping up in my everyday speech:  \\"If you have time to lean, you have time to clean,\\" \\"You could always power down,\\" \\"Good-bye, Honey Puffs.  Hello, Big Bran,\\" to list just a few.  Needless to say, I am thrilled that these wonderful comic episodes are coming out on DVD.  I am going to preorder them as soon as I finish this review.
B00005JPUN|3.0|I see the multiple negative reviews, and yes \\"Invasion\\" is just another Hollywood remake, and it has been done better. Nothing can really top the 1950's \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\" anyway. But I have to say that this isn't a bad movie. I remember hearing about the pushed back release date, the re-shot scenes, and I remember this movie only lasting in the theaters about two weeks, so when I popped it into the DVD player I had a copy of \\"The Mist\\" on hand just in case it was so bad it would be turned off after only a few minutes. I have to say I enjoyed \\"Invasion\\". Nicole Kidman is always great to watch, and throw James Bond into the mix, with some really good special effects, and a clawing sense of paranoia...\\"Invasion\\" provides a nice evening of entertainment. I liked the idea of a \\"virus\\" predator this time around, and I really liked who the \\"virus\\" arrived on Earth. (Sorry no spoilers here...but I see plenty listed in other reviews..so feel free to let them ruin the film for you..not me) There are some pretty tense scenes, and Nicole Kidman does a great job. Sometimes it becomes hip to bash a flick for little or no reason: \\"Blair Witch Project\\" and \\"Waterworld\\" come to mind, and I think \\"Invasion\\" is suffering for that reason now. Compared to \\"The Fog\\", \\"Black Christmas\\", \\"The Ring Two\\" and a myriad of other truly lousy remakes, \\"Invasion\\" at least brought something to the table. I'll re-watch it so it was worth a purchase for me, but if your undecided, throw it on your Netflix list, and give it a chance.
B000FQVY2C|5.0|I bought this CD initially for the Paris 1919 (title) track, and on my first listen I didn't really take to any of the other tracks. Then I kept listening.     This is a beautiful album. I think I couldn't appreciate the complexity of this album at first because each track is distinct from the others; I expected a CD full of Paris 1919-type songs and ended up with 22 individual masterpieces. Half of these are the rehearsal tracks, which include some string- or acoustic- versions, and lots of dialog between Cale and his producers and band. Many of the rehearsal tracks take on such different characteristics from the performance tracks that they sound like separate songs.    My favorite tracks (other than Paris 1919, which increases in complexity with each listening) include: Graham Greene [rehearsal], Paris 1919 [string mix], Half Past France [both versions], Andalucia.
B00132D808|3.0|I'm not sure what Panic was shooting for with this album but it was definitely a miss. If you're that person who heard Painic's last album on the radio and turned it up out of curiosity of \\"the new\\" this album is not even close to what you're used to.     The groom's bride is no longer a whore. Over the past years we all became touchy-feely, self-help children who like to frolic through fields of daises. No more fun upbeat songs about cancer you're looking at banjos and twang that speak lyrics like \\"Whenever I look in her eyes I see the sky\\". We're now the spokesmen for reading rainbow chasing the next sheep in line. Very disappointing!    Yes, this is still the same Panic with an immense sense of individuality, they just lost their pop. Hurry up JT give it back! Haha. Someone else commented about a case of identity crises - that's a perfect way to put it. They took the safe road with this album, but will also lose a lot of big-time fans.     I personally, was STUCK on their debut album. An unexplainable style of music that could not be any more unique. This album might have been more risky than their first if you can image. We love to see artists evolve, but it seems Panic has gone from caveman back to monkey. They lost a lot of the risk that we loved them for in their first album. In my mind they struck gold with \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\\".    I forced myself to eat repetitive plays from this Pretty.Odd. album thinking maybe I'm just not giving it a chance, or It'll grow on me w/time. After the 3rd play, I realized an album like this shouldn't deserve a spot on my iPod let alone another shot on repeat.    I WILL be buying their next album as I AM a huge fan of Panic I just had really high expectations with Pretty.Odd and I believe this was rushed out for production. I would rather buy an amazing album like their first every 10 years then to have 5 copies equal to the quality they released with Pretty.Odd - I want the same belligerent kids back that we used to hear of with that crazy reverb'd, show-tune, classic, dirty and elegant, fun attitude that they once possessed. Hearing the weather in the middle of a melody switch-up is good, \\"When the sun found the moon. She was drinking tea in a garden\\"... Are you serious???    Be warned!!
B0011HF6GE|5.0|All I know is that listening to this album is evoking emotions in me that I don't think I have ever experienced from an album before.  It's very hard to describe, and the best I can do is probably cliché by now... haunting, desolate, and undeniably beautiful.  The emotion is pure... in most songs you can't tell what he's singing about or what the lyrics are, and you don't need to... there's enough audible intention behind them.      I am reading \\"Into the Wild\\" for the first time, and the emotion and imagery evoked by that book go remarkably well with what I feel when listening to this.  It's a combination I highly recommend!  Isolation is a dominate theme in this album, just as it is in the book... perhaps that's what is so powerful about it.  It is something I think we all fear... noone wants to believe that when left with just themselves and with nature that they can somehow not feel so alone, that they don't need the presence of others.  I think he probably discovered that to some extent in his time out in the woods, and writing this album was the vehicle through which he did.  As a result this album is totally isolated as well... emerging with him from the woods as something completely unique, at least from anything I've heard.      Embrace this album and go wherever it takes you!
B0013FYTA8|5.0|Excellent follow-up to their Sophomore Album, Gasoline...they are growing as a band, evidence by the cleaner sound.  I like almost every song on this album and saw them in concert in March - they sound better live!!!  Other than rocking hard I do not know why people say they sound like Nickelback...if that is the case you are not doing Theory and Nickelback justice.  If you are a Theory or Nickelback fan, this is a must own!  Favorite Song: Bad Girlfriend
B0013K6WLM|3.0|Where's the raw blues sound that made then who they are?  Don't get me wrong, they are still the best band out there, and probably the best band to come out in the last decade or so.  I like that they are trying some new sounds but this album is missing everything that I loved about this band.  I don't really blame them, I blame Danger Mouse.  Hopefully on the next album Danger Mouse stays as far away from them as possible.  Danger Mouse is good, but not for this band.  Dan Auerbach should just produce the next album on his own...he did a hell of a job with the Radio Moscow album.
B00000DGUY|5.0|Growing up, my Dad gave me a love of all things classic rock, Dire Straits included, but I only knew \\"Walk of Life\\" and \\"Money for Nothing\\".  After a drunken recommendation from my brother, I decided that they were worth getting to know better, and I'm very glad I did.  This album is amazing and has been played dozens of times since I bought it.  I especially love \\"Romeo and Juliet\\".
B0013XS8A2|5.0|This is just amazing work of sounds and amazing sounds of work! If anything is missing at all, that would only be 5.1 sound for as much enjoying the Music of the Spheres as the current technology allows. And all I can ever wish regarding this masterpiece is a concert some day somewhere and me sitting in a good place among you nice people and living this music through my heart and cells...
B000001ELL|3.0|I give this CD 3 stars for effort. It's not bad... Everyone always lumps this record in with their worst, but it's not as bad as some say. Yes, \\"I Was Made For Loving You\\" is cheesy disco pop, but there are some solid songs on here like \\"Sure Know Something\\" and \\"Charisma\\". Ace once again saves the day (at least for me) because he's got \\"2000 Man\\" and \\"Hard Times\\" on here, two of my faves. This CD isn't raw rock n' roll like their early stuff, but it's a good Contemporary (for 1979) Pop Rock Record, the drums are tight and if you're a big KISS fan, you'll dig it.
B000YM4I4S|4.0|Mahler got it right.  Many small changes to the orchestration, here and there, make Schumann's Symphonies all the more enjoyable.  He sorted out some weaknesses and lightly re-scored in places for even better results.  This is super-polished Schumann, not Mahlerized-versions.    Having performed all of these symphonies with various orchestras over the years, it has been a delight for me to discover the Mahler editions, especially in these fine performances by the Gewandhaus and Chailly - ebbing and flowing beautifully, full of nuance and detail - most entertaining and polished.    You will enjoy these performances a great deal if you enjoy Schumann.
B0011TQLA2|5.0|This album is absolutely amazing. Although I will say it is not for the casual \\"radio hit\\" Radiohead fan. Every song is a masterpiece.
B000YIGNKE|3.0|Okay, so this is usually a two hour plus production; a mini-series, even.  To do it all in ninety minutes means a LOT of cutting.  Anyone familiar with the work -any Austen fan, in particular- knows the missing parts.  But.  First, I know they have to run the titles, but there seems to be an endless scene of Anne wandering through Kellynch hall taking inventory.  It took up time, but did zilch to move the plot forward.  The actors were quite believable and for once were as described in the book and were of the correct age onscreen. Costuming and sets were superb; filming in Bath was brilliant.  There was some serious tweaking of incident and motives, but Austen is much like Shakespeare in that it is the basic plot and the dialogue that carries the play.  But the ending . . .  a daughter, even the middle daughter, of a baronet would not be running around the streets of Bath.  There is no way she would answer to anyone calling her by her Christian name, much less stand in a public street hatless and disheveled.  And an unmarried woman to kiss a man in the public square? Puh-lease!  In case anyone has missed the point, it was once an important part of the marriage ceremony (remember that quaint charming custom?) wwhen the minister would say, \\"You may now kiss the bride.\\"  They meant that; only in marriage would such public displayed be allowed.  They had something good going until they \\"improved\\" on it.  As Lady DeBourgh was wont to say, \\"It is too bad!\\"
0385338082|5.0|this book has been on my wishlist for years (apparently it was earning rave reviews from readers online) and yet everytime i come across this at bookstores i'd tell myself to postpone buying it since it had many copies on shelf. i never even bothered leafing through it. but one day i just decided to actually read its back cover and see what all the hoopla's about.<br /><br />and then i saw the line, \\" Secrets she wouldn't share with anyone in the world: I have no idea what NATO stands for. Or even what it is. \\" and honest to god, i just grinned like an idiot. i had to read it. i actually went to a nearby cafe right after buying this from the store just so that i could begin.<br /><br />which turned out to be a bad idea cos it was literally difficult to keep a straight face once i read the first few chapters. you ever had that experience when something is really really funny but you can't laugh outright or even smile cos people around you will start getting wary? this book is deadly. you have to read it on some secluded (preferably enclosed [okay make it enclosed and sound proof]) place so you can laugh without being hampered.<br /><br />this book may even be funnier than her shopaholic series. there's just something so natural and so human about the insecurities and then the delusions of Emma. and though this might be a comic story first, this was a very cheeky romantic romp for me. and is it just me or was Jack sexy?? i just wanted to skip on the next scene where he'll appear--i can't wait what next secret he'll be dangling for Emma to squirm over.<br /><br />it's not even your run-of-the-mill chick-lit cos there were some parts that became serious they were heartbreaking. all in all, this is a highly recommended, feel good story. you'll never want to put it down (even when you know that someone soon will approach you and politely ask you to leave their premises cos you're scaring some people...)
B000TEUSJK|3.0|While I was prepared for some hard core porn, I felt it was way over the top as the story could easily have been told with less in your face sex.  Actually it seemed to interfere with the story line at times.     I Claudius tells the tale just as well (or better) without a lot of disgusting sex.   I am not the least bit a prude ... just too much of it.
1878424505|5.0|One of my favorite gifts for those I love is [[ASIN:1878424505 The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom, A Toltec Wisdom Book]], Don Miguel Ruiz's wonderful guide for living. These simple agreements: be impeccable, don't take things personally, don't make assumptions and do your best are framed by a bounty of common sense thoughts that help you to understand how your life actually works. Over the years I've given copies of this little treasure to my wife and to each of my children and to several others who I have considered to be special from time to time. 'Agreements' is just 150 short pages and if you are like me, you will pick it up again and again to ponder those snippets of simple wisdom that pop out at you. It adds for you a new dimension to peaceful contemplation and I highly recommend that everyone pick up a personal copy to read.
B0013FDM7E|2.0|I greatly enjoyed Will Smith's acting in this movie.  He is a top-notch actor to begin with, and he turned in a fine performance.<br /><br />Yet the special effects seem a bit warmed over.  Had I not seen the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, I may have enjoyed them, but it seems Gollum from the movie adaptation of Tolkien's opus has been cloned and rewarmed.  Perhaps they did this to save money, having blown more of the budget on the top-notch title character, Will Smith.<br /><br />Of course if this is the case, I have to say I generally applaud the choice of a good actor/actress over whizz-bang SFX's.<br /><br />Mostly, I chafe under the tone of despair that this movie cast.  It is difficult or impossible to adequately discuss my problems with this movie without spoiling it, so in respect for movie viewers, I conclude this point here by merely saying that I flat-out DO NOT RECOMMEND this movie.  (Despite Smith's believability, depth of character, and ability to get us to care about his character.)<br /><br />Furthermore, don't get me started on the extra features!  If you think the MOVIE was dark, don't even go to the extra features menu!!!
1416550518|5.0|In 1999 Ursula Ryan plans to make a film about the events at The House at Riverton in 1924.  She meets with the only known person still alive, ninety-eight years old nursing home resident Grace Reeves to confirm the facts.<br /><br />Grace was fourteen years old when, like her mother, she obtained work as a servant to the aristocratic Hartford family at Riverton House.  She especially enjoyed \\"invisibly\\" watching Lord Asbury's two nieces and nephews when they visited.  Her favorite target was Hannah, who was her age.  In 1924, sisters Hannah and Emmeline were allegedly the only witnesses to poet R.S. Hunter committing suicide at Riverton.  However, Grace also saw what happened on that fatal day as Hannah's selfish plans and Emmeline's jealousy surface while the maid observes first hand the death of the poet.<br /><br />This is an engaging haunting love story that brings to life a bygone era of the English aristocracy in decline following WWI.  The four prime characters seem genuine though filtered by the nonagenarian memory of seventy five years ago.  Kate Morton provides a strong character driven tale of hate, deceit, and love with the more powerful element triumphing.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B0011FDVKE|4.0|This is the first Tift Merritt album I've tried.  I am a big fan  of the crop of excellent \\"Alt-Country\\" singer/songwriters like Kathleen Edwards and Sarah Harmer.  Somehow, I stumbled across the \\"Broken\\" track and it was jangly and hookey enough to convince me to try this out.  I'm glad I did.    Her songwriting and themes are extremely varied: an almost jangle-pop effort on \\"Broken\\", a Motown groove on \\"Tell Me Something True\\", and  the minor-keyed reflective rocker of \\"My Heart if Free\\" really show the breadth of her abilities.  The latter (\\"...Free\\") about the thoughts of a soldier at the WWII Normandy landing really took me by surprise - what a fine song this is!    Some tracks are mind-challenging and a little disturbing like that.  Other ones are happy-go-lucky ones that make you feel like you're wrapped in a fuzzy blanket.      I'm not really a fan of Emmy Lou Harris or Nanci Griffith (frankly, they bore me to tears), or other folkies who seem to be compared to Tift.  I think this album has better drive than that,  and isn't so gosh darn \\"folkie\\", which I don't really care for.    Her band is quite competent - they groove together well, keeping it just sparse enough to let Tift's angelic voice cut through.  The harmonizing vocals are good and carry nice odd 5ths and other blends instead of the usual tired country-style chords.  I'm not the first reviewer to use \\"angel\\" to describe her voice.  It's the truth.  It almost sparkles with the ethereal sweetness of Alison Krauss, and believe me, that's saying something.    To give you a better picture of where I'm coming from, The Beatles, The Who, Jackson Browne, Kathleen Edwards, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Sarah Harmer ---- quite a weird list, eh?   If that sounds like you, you'll like this album.    So, why only 4 stars and not 5?   Believe me, this is a REALLY GOOD album.  But I hold back 5-star ratings for things that are landmark achievements.
B0010V4TZU|5.0|I had to chime in with a review here because I can't believe all the reviewers that call this wonderful new band derivative and unoriginal.  Sure they are influenced by the Police and Paul Simon and perhaps several other great artists, but at least their influences aren't Justin Timberlake, Britney, or Eminem.  This is far and away my favorite new group of the last few years(Cat Empire is a not too close second), and the great thing about this young band is you can tell they have the talent and the chops to be around for a long time and continue to experiment with a host of great sounds.  Since I find the whole disc a pleasure I won't comment on the discs best cuts, but instead say that I find only 2 cuts less than superior, and those are Mansard Roof, and Campus.  Even those cuts aren't bad, just not classics. Now I will let you know this is a new version of the review I wrote about this band 2 months ago.  This disc has really grown on me.  I can't get enough of it.  So I even upped my former 5 star review, and got more gushy on these guys.  Exceptional band.
1569242739|5.0|EVERY VEGAN & NON VEGAN SHOULD OWN THIS BOOK. I am not a vegan and absolutely love this book. The recipes are perfect and delicious! Our household favorite is the Tiramisu cupcake! I will never forget the first time I made these. My husband inhaled 3 of them in under a minute! DELICIOUS! EVERYONE SHOULD OWN THIS BOOK!
0312965788|5.0|One of the best books I've read in my life.  A must read.  Very well written.  Makes you want to write like him.<br /><br />I remember seeing my high school biology teacher reading this book at her desk while she had some time to herself, while we did our thing with dissections, etc.  It seemed that she couldn't get her hands off this book.  And I'd wonder what the book was about.  Something about creatures.  Maybe it was about GOD and church and religion.<br /><br />Now that I've had a chance to read this book, twenty years later, I can say that it is a wonderful book!  You don't want this book to end.  And now I understand why my biology teacher was so hooked on it.<br /><br />This is a nonfictional book about an English veterinarian writing about his funny and sometimes dramatic profession.  From how he started, to his everyday events in a small town (away from the big city such as London) to how he meets his future wife, and his gradual establishment of his veterinary life.  This book is filled with funny moments that makes you pause with a smile on your face.  And has its poignant moments that makes you realize its wonderful writing.<br /><br />This book gives you a glimpse of what the veterinary world is like on his side, on the countryside of life, with real people and real stories, and of course, with real animals.  Animals and people and veterinary work that you will come to love.
0143038419|4.0|Elizabeth is one of the most self-centered people whom you will ever get to know.  She is also insecure and spends hours, weeks, months, trying to figure herself out.  This kind of book had to be written by her.  Most people would not know how to talk this much about themselves.  I did learn from her. In the future, I will try to be more understanding of friends who are like her.  I learned more about Rome, meditating, and Indonesia.      Elizabeth does have some strenthgs.  She is bright.  Her writing style is entertaining most of the time.  She is open beyond belief telling about her bladder infection and more.  I admire that she was committed to learning Italian.  She is very good at meeting new people and establishing relationships in new and strange environments. I respect that she sucessfully sold this book!!!    I kept thinking about how she grew up to be so sad, insecure, and focused on herself.  Did her parents give her praise and tell her she was the center of the universe?      Now that I have pointed out her faults, I would like to copy her trip to Rome.
B000ZN803G|5.0|This is one of the best movies i have seen in a LONG time. Highly recommended!! There are lessons in this movie that you will want to remember. Definitly makes me want to travel to the places he went.....
B000VNMMR0|5.0|Bruce Willis returns as Detective John McClane in \\"Live Free or Die Hard,\\" the fourth film in the \\"Die Hard\\" film franchise! In this film, McClane faces his toughest challenge yet when he takes on a group of cyber-terrorists hell-bent on shutting down the American infrastructure. But 21st Century villains are about to get a taste of 20th Century justice! The film features some fantastic action sequences, and the plot is great, if a tad predictable.<br />As far as acting goes, it's good overall. Willis, as usual, is great as McClane. He maybe a few years older, but he can still unload a can of whoop-#*$ on the bad guys, and is still good with the wise-cracks. Justin Long is also good as Matt Farrell, a computer hacker, and McClane's side-kick in the film. Sadly, Timothy Olyphant and Maggie Q, two respectable actors, are given one-dimensional villains to play, though they do the best with what they got to work with. And Kevin Smith makes a memorable, if frustratingly short, appearance as one of Farrell's fellow hackers.<br />This is definitely one of the best films in the series. Despite some flaws, this is a terrific film that \\"Die Hard\\" fans will surely enjoy!<br />Movie/DVD Grade: A-
B000IONJJ2|4.0|A Fish Called Wanda is a delightful little comedy about a heist-gone-right-gone-wrong.     It seems that there's very little honor among thieves, when four crooks can't follow the get-away plan they'd concocted because they're too busy trying to screw each other out of the loot. We follow them as they plot, and counter-plot against one another, leading to what is possibly the most hilarious torture scene ever filmed, and a number of awkward, aborted attempts at adultery.    The question finally becomes: who is so low that they'll manage to out-con the others? And to answer that, you need to watch the movie.    Fun, funny, and not showing age one bit. Four stars.
B0010AN7Y0|3.0|This film is so close to being wonderful--the cast is incredible, the story is great, and the locations are super. But, things just don't hang together in tone or content to make it truly touching or truly funny. Hugh Laurie and Imelda Staunton deliver wonderful and touching performances and that in itself is worth the price of the DVD. But, the Kenneth Branagh - Rita Rudner characters are the backbone of the piece and that relationship never becomes understandable. Plus, the tone moves from slapstick to serious without any real connective pieces. Okay, I will probably watch it again and maybe even again--I mean just watching the Cambridge Footlights crew together is a pleasure (and Stephen Fry always makes me smile). This film is often compared to \\"The Big Chill\\" but it doesn't deliver the same impact.
0743270754|5.0|I've always believed that the aim of every biographer should be to make the reader care about the subject. In other words, you should like / dislike / despise / deplore the subject of the biography but the last thing you should be is neutral. In this biography of five wonderfully gifted and ambitious people Kearns really does make the reader care about the characters. You might not like them all but you can't help admiring them and what they did. The civil war period comes alive in this book. The book is rivetting from start to finish. It really does have that 'hard to put down' quality which every good book should have. If you buy this book, turn off the TV / CD / radio, do whatever it takes to get some peace and quiet, put your feet up and enjoy the simple pleasure of reading an exceptionally well written book.
B0012Q94QW|1.0|LMAO!! this garbage actually gets 5 stars???????,it's unbliveably BOOOORRRING!!!!!!,bad story,bad acting ,bad plot,very very bad scrpit,,the movie was so bad that we left during the middle of it,just dont buy the dvd,the movie got 4.9 at imdb which ain't bad for a movie like this
B000148KK2|5.0|I also have all of Diana Kralls albums, most on vinyl, this on SACD, and I am shocked by the negativity of some of the reviews.  This is my favorite album of hers, by far.  I love the original songs, and her cover of Elvis Costellos's marginal song \\"Almost Blue\\", raised it to standard level.  Come on guys and gals, give me a break on this.  Don't be mad she stepped out of her genre a little bit.  This is a great jazz infused album I would recommend to anyone with no hesitation.
B000ZN802W|5.0|BASED IN TRUE STORY AND LOT OF LESSONES YOU WILL<br />GET FROM THE MOVIE
B000ZLFALI|5.0|Gorgeous.    Across the Universe is a gorgeous film, with wonderful artistic direction, an incredible soundtrack (naturally), and a fine plot set in the turbulent youth movement of the late 1960s.    I never would have thought that you could create such a story out of the songs of the Beatles, and even if the film stretches itself to meet the fab four's lyrics from time to time (giving the character Maxwell a silver hammer to use?), it still ultimately comes across as almost natural. Almost as though the Beatles had written the music for the movie, and not the other-way-around. Certainly what comes to my mind the most are numbers like \\"A Little Help From My Friends,\\" \\"Revolution,\\" and \\"Hey Jude.\\"    For each number, the film expertly crafts visual imagery and tone. Even some of the songs that I've never particularly liked, like Strawberry Fields Forever, become engaging and magical, here. This movie provides the viewer with a number of moments that will stay with you. The gigantic Uncle Sams in the induction center? The sexy nurses (all played by Salma Hayek, I believe) singing Happiness is a Warm Gun? The dead Vietnamese women singing the title song? Are images not likely to leave anytime soon.    Setting the story in the late 60s, with a backdrop of student protests and war, is brilliant, too. Not only is it a great setting for a strong love story, but it ties into the times in which the Beatles were writing and lends a genuine feel to the whole project. I do not think that the Beatles would have been unhappy to see their music used so.    All in all, this movie is more than a movie: it is a statement. An event. It takes incredible music, blends that with stunning visuals, and a fine story woven into a stirring, and appropriate, backdrop. In a word?    Gorgeous.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|Paramount's technical wizards (that are obviously true Star Trek Fans) take STAR TREK's Best Season of the Original Series to a level that it has not achieved before. Never has the original series looked and sounded so crisp and clear.  What really sets this DVD set apart is the imaginative new graphics that give the series a shine that the original producers would have loved to give viewers back in 1966.  Producer Robert Justman mentions in the featurette, \\"Spacelift: Transporting Trek into the 21st Century\\" that he is very delighted with the new special effects as they are shot in the same manner and spirit as the original 60s show but not with the cheap plywood models.  The new special effects are not overwhelming but really give STAR TREK a look and feel that belongs to the show and brings it up to date with the comparable special effects of space travel of each spinoff series.  The show maintains it's 60s production values with the interiors, sets and uniforms that never looked sharper. While all the episodes look so much better...almost every fan will notice that certain episodes such as \\"Tomorrow Is Yesterday\\" and \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\" seem to get an even greater boost with new looks coming at critical moments. The much improved graphical displays of the Enterprise orbiting planets and soaring through space really give the show a true 23rd Century feel...coupled with the clean crisp look of the original material...really make us believe that the crew of the Enterprise truly are boldly going...at least on DVD...where they have never gone before.
B000UFAURI|5.0|I love Foo Fighters. Saw some of the songs performed live. Dave is truely a talented musician. Favorite track: Let it Die. Some acoustic tracks on it too. Nice mixture of music.
B0013FDM7E|4.0|I AM LEGEND was a good four star film starring Will Smith.  I enjoyed the special effects and computer animations as well as the staging of this very good sci-fi remake of the OMEGA MAN.  In fact, I enjoyed it quite a bit more than the original film and recommend it for all fans of Will Smith.<br /><br />I was not at all surprised that Will Smith could pull off some very serious and dramatic acting under genuine \\"sci-fi\\" conditions that strain credulity. As I always suspected, he is much more than a likeable stunt man and should enjoy a great acting career over the years ahead.<br /><br />The ending of the film was a bit of a bummer, but we all knew the basic plot anyhow. I thought he went out like an action figure but was given a good chance to demonstrate his very fine acting skills.  As he usually does, he portrayed a very likeable and basically very good individual, and did this without appearing corny. His character was trying to set straight a failure of the entire human race and took his responsibilities as a research doctor very personally.
B00000JPYD|5.0|when I was 15 years old! This was my first exposure to Robin Trower and I was hooked. The title song was something mystical, with the phase shifted , swirling guitar  and the great voice(still one of the all time greats I think) of the late James Dewar. Then there were \\"Too Rolling Stoned\\", \\"Day of the Eagle\\" and on and on.Trower has always been compared to Hendrix, but I have always thought he has his own trademark sound.This album is definitely in my top 10 rock albums from the '70's.
0786838655|5.0|My son got the first book for Christmas and absolutely loved it. He had finished all three of the books by the end of March.  It is so fun to find books that gets your kids reading.
0385338724|5.0|This book is fun and easy to read.  The character is believable.  It is going to appeal to woemn and probably not to men, however.
B000AP04L0|5.0|No DVD collection is complete without Office Space. It's a classic. My friends and I are always making references to this movie. Red stapler, that's my red stapler. Yeeeeeah, I'm gonna need you to put the cover sheet with the TPS reports. Great movie!
0374105235|5.0|\\"A Long Way Gone\\" is an extremely interesting book written by Ishmael Beah a former child solider that fought in the war in Sierra Leone. The book follows Ishmael through his life at the beginning of the war depicting the terrible things that were done to innocent civilians and how he was forced to witness the dreadful things happening around him. During the war Ishmael would lose everything, his family, his friends, his childhood and even his mind. He would fight in the ranks of the Sierra Leone Army as a child solider at the age of 13. He would witness terrible things happening to men and then do the same terrible things himself. He would do things with his own two hands that even seem horrible for grown men to do. \\"A Long Way Gone\\" is an extremely important book because it helps remind us that there are other things going out there in the world beyond our safe homes and living rooms with our 52 inch Plasma TVs.     Kacper, a student at Prospect High School

0142004235|5.0|Though it's been years since I read this book it still remains to be one of my favorites.  A classic tale of good vs. evil... highly recommended.
B0000060NH|5.0|I bought this after I happened to see part of the movie \\"Four Brothers\\" which featured a couple of songs from this soundtrack... (i.e. Chloe's Apt. and Trouble Man).  Wow.  The song \\"Trouble Man\\" is hands down the coolest song I have ever heard.  It is worth buying just for that song.  This is a solid soundtrack... mostly instrumental.... it has a nice cohesive feel so you can just let it play.   If someone is harshing your mellow, put this on and everything will be allright.
B000852GIQ|4.0|If you are a fan of Yann Tiersen then you will like this record.  I don't think it is as strong as Le Phare or Rue des Cascades but it is very solid.  There are a couple songs with electric guitar, bass, and drums which are good.  But personally, I like when he sticks with the traditional instruments.  Elizabeth Frazer sings on 2 songs and I think that's pretty exciting.
B000PFUA9G|5.0|5th Gear by Brad Paisley, continues this artists excellent CD offerings.  I recently purchased this CD and have played it over and over again.  Brad Paisley, as has been well-documented, is an exceptional guitar player, and that is evident on this great CD; especially on the instrumental, Throttleneck.  From ballads to fast-paced country rockers, Brad Paisley is so consistent in his performance that he has, for me, entered that rarified air that very few have occupied (Garth Brooks, George Strait, Brooks and Dunn).  When you shell out money for a CD, you need to be certain it is money well-spent.  Brad Paisley again proves that he is a great bet for your entertainment dollar.  A five star CD.
B0015AARJI|5.0|What a great addition to an already great system.  Have had the PS3 since it came out.  Got my new DualShock controller today and immedately played ToyHome 2nd Gear.      The new controller is very nice with this game.  When your car or runs into something, you can really tell!    I also like the fact the controller is a little heavier.  I think it makes turning the cards a little more realistic
B000YENUI6|5.0|David Cronenberg has a way of making sure that we take a look at distrubing images and truly understand them.  Eastern Promises has plenty of those, from a Russian mobster's throat being sawed open by a feeble-minded teenager to Viggo Mortensen's impromptu nudity in a harrowing bath-house scuffle.  Ballsy.  Literally.  What Eastern Promises deals in is humanity and how it is a senseless, jolting dance at times and a ballet at others.  Girls ransported from Russia to London are kept as prostitutes and slaves by the Russian Mob, drugged up, left for dead when they escape.  One of the unfortunate girls turns up pregnant and bleeding in a London drugstore.  She dies during childbirth, leaving behind a beautiful baby girl and a diary of her tormented life.  The novel is written in Russian.  Midwife Anna (Naomi Watts) tries to have her Russian uncle decipher the book, but when he gives her a warning to have the book buried with the dead girl, she go elswhere for trasnlation.  Right to the man responsible for the girl's horrific torment.  Nikolai (Mortensen) is the driver and confidant to the a Russian mafioso's drunken, careless son with clear aspirations of rising within the crime family to a more respectable position.  Anna's appearance shakes his allegiance and his ability to continue doing unspeakble things in the name of honor and tattooed code.<br /><br />This is a great movie with a great twist at the end that you wouldn't have expected at all, unless you follow the subtle clues carefully.  Filled with suspense and brutality as only Cronenberg can show us, this film comes very close to eclipsing such crime dramas as The Godfather or Goodfellas in its blunt clarity.  In the sea of tripe that is floating out there, it is refreshing to see a movie that is not filled with Hollywood cliches and product placement techniques.<br /><br />Dig it!
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|I, like many, was so thrilled to hear that REM were getting back to making a more straight-ahead rock album featuring guitar, bass, drums and vocals.  Stylistically Accelerate takes from Life's Rich Pageant, Document and to some degree Monster.  To me nothing will beat the IRS records from Murmur to Document.  But Accelerate just sounds so good given their recent 3 releases.  REM became one of my all-time favorite bands playing straight ahead rock w/o the atmospheric fluff heard on recent albums.  The songs here are played with a sense of urgency.      I'm not going to sit here and write a dissertation on each song.  What I will say is that this is the best REM album I've heard since Automatic.  I do think it deserves a 5 star.  I get excited when I listen to this album.  Gives me the feeling I used to get when they put great albums out.  I can assure you one thing.  Accelerate will win back the fans they've lost since New Adventures In Hi-Fi.  Like many great albums it gets better with subsequent listens.  I don't think this disc will sit in the dust bins of one's CD collection.      It's great to have REM back making great music again.  Thanks to the boys from Athens, GEE AYY.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Michael Buble, singing in the classic style that hearkens back to Ole Blue Eyes and Dean Martin, is in fine form on It's Time.  A great CD that gets even better with repeated listenings.  The following are song by song reviews:<br /><br />1. Feeling Good 4/5<br />2. A Foggy Day (In London Town) 5/5<br />3. You Don't Know Me 3/5<br />4. Quando, Quando, Quando 3/5<br />5. Home 5/5<br />6. Can't Buy Me Love 3/5<br />7. The More I See You 4/5<br />8. Save The Last Dance For Me 5/5<br />9.

B000021XR5|5.0|This is easily one of the best albums of the 90's before it all went to garbage (on the radio not STP)  Every song on here is a classic.  Listen to this regularly even today.
B00110K62U|4.0|Having recently seen a live performance in London, I was excited to see this 10th Anniversary performance with the original cast members on DVD. The performances, backed by a full symphony orchestra and chorus were excellent and reminded me of how majestic and emotionally involving this play is. I especially appreciated the positive, for a change, image of Christianity presented and the themes of forgiveness and atonement that give emotional impact to the story. The video quality is a little less than current standards due to the age of the original recordings and those not familiar with the play may not be able to follow the story, since only the songs are performed. However, for those already familiar with the play, this is as good as it gets! Highly recommended.
0385503954|4.0|Very engrossing story.  McEwan's writing captured me in the very beginning and held onto me all the way through.  Although it was clear before Part One was over who the actual rapist was, it did not diminish my enjoyment of the story as it was clear to me that the book was more about the characters and their progression than that of the reader.<br /><br />Although this is not a life changing story, it is a memorable one that will stick with you.  Not to mention, there are worse ways to spend two afternoons.
B000FGGE68|3.0|In the distant future, a viral infection called Hemophagia that causes humans to become genetically enhanched vampires with special speed, amazing stamia, strength and high intelligence has broke out thus creating a sub-species race of vampire-esque humans. A secret war between the Hemophagia infected and the normal healthy humans have waged on, scientist/dicator Daxus (Nick Chinlund) wants to wipe the Hemophagia infected out from humanity and an infected woman named Violet (Milla Jovovich) searches for a special cure for her kind to become normal again as she struggles to find it and defeat Daxus.<br /><br />Exciting Sci-fi fantasy actioner in the tradition of \\"The Matrix\\", \\"Gattaca\\", \\"Blade Runner\\" and \\"Blade\\", \\"Ultraviolet\\" is a live-action comic book brought to life. I thought the action was spectacular including the martial arts choreography with some very good stunts, sure the acting could have been better but this is a nice futuristic b-movie. The film co-stars Nick Chinlund, Cameron Bright and William Fichtner, the movie is just enjoyable b-movie popcorn leave your brain at the door fun.<br /><br />This DVD contains the unrated cut with never before seen footage that was cut out of the theatrical release and contains only two extras like as a featurette and feature commentary from the lovely Milla Jovovich with trailers to other Sony releases.
B0000028UK|5.0|It's hard to believe after the amazing Ten that Pearl Jam could top it, well they did with VS.  Again each Pearl Jam album is unique unlike most bands that have most of their albums sound the same.  This is a great rock album that nothing else in the 90's could touch except maybe Nirvana.  Solid songs, great all around!
B0013D8LOU|1.0|What SHOULD have been a delightfully ghoulish gorefest quickly turns into a long tedious BOREfest -- thanks (mostly) to Stephen Sondheim's wretchedly dull music. The Broadway \\"legend\\" might be a great lyricist, but he really can't write a decent melody to save his life. (His catchiest tune is probably \\"Send in the Clowns,\\" which is saying a lot.) Now, as for the dull direction...    I love musicals AND horror movies but this was just painful to sit through: slow, unfunny, and surprisingly unimaginative. What's missing is the ghoulish glee, macabre humor, and wicked sense of fun. (Not to mention decent pacing.) I love Tim Burton, but his direction here isn't up to the challenge. It doesn't help to have non-singers in the lead roles either. But then again, all the dazzling art direction and great acting in the world couldn't save the movie from that HORRIBLE music. Each time the actors strained to belt out another dreary dirge (sounding like they're making it up as they go along), I wanted to slash my throat with a razor. Thank god for all the throat-slitting toward the end, or otherwise I would have fallen asleep. The amazing set design is the only thing that really shines. Depp didn't do anything new, except sing poorly, and Bonham was terribly miscast.     Let's just hope that Tim Burton goes back to doing his own thing -- and that Broadway finds some better composers.

0739334085|5.0|Wonderful. To hear Barack Obama talk about his vision to unite our country is truly thrilling. He lays out the divisions and the way to bring us together to solve the problems that face us. Truly inspiritional.
B0000029DD|5.0|In love -- it's the only way I can describe how I feel about this album.  It has been in my top 5 favorite albums of all time for a while now.    Jeff has the most amazing voice....with such an unbelievable range.   The reason I felt compelled to write a review here (after owning the album for so so long) is because I was shocked at the amount of people who said that besides \\"Hallelujah\\", the album is no good. ARE YOU KIDDING ME??!  Were these people listening to the same album that the rest of us have come to know as pure magic?    I'm beginning to wonder if people even know what REAL music is anymore.    I have listened to the entire album hundreds of times by now, and it still blows me away. What an absolutely gifted talent he was.  It's truly a shame that he left the world so soon.
B000002BFZ|1.0|This bands sucks beyond words.  After TEN the band became Eddie VEdders solo act of pop rock radio trash.  Every album after this has been even worse and Backspacer is the worst yet.
B00008CLOA|2.0|Music originally recorded on analog tape AND mastered correctly, as was Dark Side of the Moon, make digital re-issues of any format a mute point.  While SACD is a step in the right direction, even well-kept, original vinyl is superior.  The vinyl, half-speed, two-channel master recording by Stereophile(long out of print)is the best way to experience DSM.  Listen to music as it was recorded, not by electronically enhanced bits and bytes.  Analog to digital reviews are a waste when the original format is obtainable.
0596009208|4.0|That's what the \\"Head First\\" philosophy seems to purport, and the foray into their lingua franca (Java) is a prime example. From the start Sierra and Bates break down the essence of \\"whole brain\\" learning a potentially dry subject like programming and design in the Java language. They then apply this methodology to each chapter by framing core instruction with cute sidebar humor and illustrations and then concluding with review exercises in the form of puzzles that openly appeal to the right-brained audience. Such a shift in the paradigm of computer science instruction has been scoffed at by many, but the truth of the matter is the new generation of developers are those who have an affinity to agile-dev, elegant-syntax type technologies such as Ruby or PHP, those who are learning from the avant-garde likes of the \\"Poignant Guide to Ruby\\". For Java evangelists extraordinaire like Bert and Kathy, making the sacred core language that much more accessible only made sense. That being said, I would caution the droves of aspiring young webmasters (not to mention migrants from older high-level languages) to understand that even with the \\"connect the dots\\" activities besprinkled throughout some assumptions about programming competency are made by the authors. In my opinion, this would not be an exclusive venture into the world of Java (and it's a BIG one) but a supplemental text that spawns the \\"aha\\" moments when more condensed and comprehensive texts like those by Cay Horstmann just don't drive a critical point across. I can say that I do appreciate the authors jumping immediately (erm, head first) into OOP concepts.     In sum, I would say that this book is not for everybody, but for those that need a healthy diversion from the \\"standard\\" reference material (read: Java API).
B00132D808|1.0|I was expecting a lot and ended up dissappointed. Listened to the first couple of songs and I was bored, but I was hopeful that as the CD kept playing it'd make a switch like as last cd and then get pretty good. But it didn't happen. Every song sounds the same, boring, tasteless, and something you would listen to go to sleep. I'm extremely dissappointed, they're not the best band but they were really fun to listen to, now they  re not even that anymore. But if you're a true die hard fan, you'll obviously find this album great.
B000TX7B5U|1.0|Now we just have one goof instead of the band of goofs with the same stupid lyrics and dying goat vocals.....
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|I don't fully get the \\"throwback\\" tag that so many people seem to apply to this album. Yes, this album is a rocker, and some of REMs other albums have been rockers, but I really feel like Accelerate could only have come out of the times we're in. 80% of the Americans think this country is on the wrong track and the rest of the world had lost a great deal of the respect they once had for us. What better way to deal with it than to turn up the volume and rock!?! And where past REM rockers have still noodled around a little, these songs start fast, get to the point, and drive it home with hardly a wasted motion.     Just like the tongue-in-cheek pop of \\"Shiny Happy People\\" and the angsty drama of \\"Everybody Hurts\\" were ideally suited to the national mood at the closing of the Reagan-Bush era, I feel like the loud and fast songs on Accelerate are perfect for the end of this disastrous Bush II administration. They seem to scream, \\"hurry up and get this sh** over with!\\"    While they may have missed the national pulse with their last few albums, I feel like Accelerate really hits home. Like most artists, REM seems to produce their best work when times are tough. If anything, I'd like to hear them play even louder and faster--maybe they could somehow speed up time until January 2009.
0131103628|5.0|The \\"K & R\\", as it is widely known has a reputation of both being the pure encapsulation of and a terse discourse in the C Language. Both characterizations have equal merit. That being said, this shockingly succinct (at only 272 pages) publication is both tutorial and reference. In short, more of the \\"madness behind the method\\" is covered in this tome than the unwieldy but for some reason mandated college texts from the likes of Deitel or from the more cursory \\"Dummies\\" efforts. From the onset, the authors waste no time jumping into each concept with solid code examples. At first these may seem a little complex and in actuality they are--many of the standard library functions are stepped through to drive across such concepts. The authors preface with \\"C is not a big language\\", and that is true, however when one considers how the \\"B-52\\" of programming languages has been the linguistic basis for the more popular Java, C# and C++ (not to mention what for Ruby, Perl and Python are implemented in) the essence of this work by the authors of the language cannot be overstated. This is written with the student of the programming art in mind, whether at the collegiate or professional level. This should be a required introduction for Comp Sci or Engineering majors to that art, and every serious programming student or practitioner should own it. Given that it still holds its original value, chances are most do. Don't let the price fool you--The C Programming Language is worth its weight in gold!
B00004T0P1|5.0|I had bought this album simply for the track \\" The Egg Travels' but I was in for a surprise. James Newton Howard had created a masterpiece. A one of a kind score. Everything was so entertaining. If it wasn't beautiful it was tense and exciting. The best thing about this album his approach with the African voices and rhythms. This score is one of my absolute favorites. I've listened to it so many times and I'm still not tired of it.     A must own for those who love great film music.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Another solid release from this great consistent rock band.  The songs are well written as always with great rythems, lyrics, riffs and vocals.  This album almost sounded like Yeild II which made me love it even more.  Solid release, great job!
B00005JPTK|1.0|I love Will Smith. The trailors and 'plot/themes' sounded like this would be a GREAT movie. I'll give Smith an A for his acting, although he didnt have to do too much of it in this slow, plodding movie.<br /><br />The special effects were good but this was just a horrible, long (only 1hr 40min, but seemed like many more) and plodding film that went nowhere.<br /><br />And to boot, they have to kill his dog near the middle of the film making it depressing as well as boring?!!?<br /><br />I liked the original ending far better then the alternate one, although both endings had a hard time trying to make something out of this boring and predictable nothing of a movie.<br /><br />Could have been a great one with Smith and the very interesting premise behind the Movie, yet it turned in to a dud that goes in the 'Watch Once, But Never Again' bin.<br /><br />I wish I could give it zero stars for the sole reason they killed the dog. There was no reason behind having Smith have to Kill his only companion....served no purpose other then to make it depressing as well as boring and had they kept the dog alive, perhaps his antics could have gotten this to maybe 2 or 3 stars as there would have been many areas they could have used the dog...<br /><br />Oh well.....very disappointed in this one.....
0618918248|4.0|Despite his \\"lifelong love affair with science\\", Richard Dawkins in this book is primarily a logician. He's brilliant, but not infrequently goes into the hypothetical and abstruse using acronyms like NOMA, TTSS, IVF, 747, and so on. He speculates on the genetic and evolutionary roots of religion and explains how religion is a byproduct of the survival benefits of a child's tendency to obey and respect parents and elders and the child's tendency to ascribe causes to all events. This gullibility is exploited by leaders.<br /><br />He's well read and quotes from sources from many fields. For example:<br />Luther:<br />\\"Whoever wants to be a Christian should tear the eyes out of his reason.\\"<br />Senica:<br />\\"Religion is regarded by the common people as true, by the wise as false, and by the rulers as useful.\\"<br />Einstein:<br />\\"I do not believe in a personal God...If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it.\\"<br />Jesus:<br />\\"If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother and wife and children, and bothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple. \\"<br />Sam Harris,<br />\\"Of the twenty-five most dangerous cities 76 percent are in red states, and 24 percent are in blue states.

Twenty-four of the twenty-nine states with the highest rates of theft are red. Of the twenty-two states with the highest rates of murder, seventeen are red.\\"<br /><br />His marvelous way with words can be seen in many passages, such as this one: \\"To be fair, much of the Bible is not systematically evil but just plain weird, as you would expect of a chaotically cobbled-together anthology of disjointed documents, composed, revised, translated, distorted and \\"improved\\" by hundreds of anonymous authors, editors and copyists, unknown to us and mostly unknown to each other over nine centuries.\\" This entertaining book explains religious ideas from the perspective of an avowed atheist. .<br /><br />I originally listened to this book on CD, but shortly after getting started ordered a hardcopy.

B000UFAURI|4.0|First of all, the Foo Fighters albums can be broken into two categories: Garage and Studio.  Literally.  The albums produced by the band in their own studio are tougher, grainier, and heartier: this is one of those...almost.  The album seems to try and lean towards the masterful sound of the self titled album and 'There is Nothing Left to Lose' but comes up short.  Overall this sits about where Color and Shape sits: well above the quality most bands put out, but not quite what these guys are really capable of.  Worth a purchase for sure, much better than 'In Your Honor'.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|What a great movie.  Wonderful breakout performance of new actors.  Great Music, all sung on set.  Great Cameos by Bono and Joe Cocker.  Should have won Best Picture for 2007, and should have won best costuming for 2007 (For Mr. Kite and I Want You/She's so heavy scenes).
B0014YVCDK|5.0|I remember picking this up on release day and how unique and awesome it was and still is years later.  Great songs, awesome riffs, great lyrics, great vox, killer gatefold artwork and overall and winner of an album.  Great job!
B000F0UUT6|5.0|I thought that this collection was great.  The movie itself is always great, but the clarity and extras were just as good.  I loved the book that came with the DVDs.  It had a lot of great information about the filming and some wonderful pictures of the cast & crew in the process of filming.  Overall, I thought that I got my money's worth.
B000HEVZ6W|5.0|Simply stated, this is one of the most moving and intellectually stimulating movies of recent years.  The Blu-Ray release is nothing short of spectacular.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, and Jude Law can all make a case for this being their greatest artistic achievement. Each actor seems to cease being themselves and immerse themselves into the role with a completeness that I have rarely witnessed on screen.  As one begins to watch even the first scenes, you are drawn into Ethan Hawke's character and cannot help but become emotionally attached.<br /><br />The cinematography is breathtaking.  The use of color as a provacative element is masterful.  The score is wonderful, a perfect accompaniment to the theme.<br /><br />Also, the sci-fi element focuses on realistic near future themes.  People do NOT fly strange cars and go to strangely shaped buildings...instead there is a realistic element that enables the viewer to enjoy the film for what it is, and not be distracted with pointless sci-fi stereotypes.  The issue of genetic manipulation is one that has been brought to attention lately and this film manages to show both sides of the issue without appearing to be a piece of propaganda.  The Valids as they are called have all of the benefits of the genetic manipulation while the Invalids do not.  The interesting premise here is that even an Invalid can rise above and beyond what his or her capabilities 'should' be.  Also a Valid may still resort to the basic human instincts and actions despite all coding in the opposite direction.  An amazing portrayal of what might be possible and very real in the near future.<br /><br />I believe that this film should be the cornerstone of any Blu-Ray collection and cannot recommend it highly enough.  Definately in my top 5 of all time!
B000002ITK|5.0|All the twisted greats are here plus awesome live tunes, this collectionb is very well put together!  Play it loud mutha!

B000002BYD|5.0|This is my favorite Pearl Jam album, so many amazing songs that bring back so many memories right to the day I picked this up on release day.  This album was like the soundtrack to my teenage years.  From start to finish this is a perfect rock album, every song is excellent, the gatefold packageing is awesome and the sound quality here is great.  Solid album.
B000002KCV|5.0|I have difficulty expressing how good this album is. One of the perfect elements is Nicolette Larson; no one besides Emmylou Harris has been able to sing harmony with Neil like Nicolette (RIP)). \\"Comes A Time\\" and \\"Lotta Love\\" alone make this one of the greatest albums out of the '70's. I am unable to understand how a musician can put so much emotion into a single song...it breaks and mends the heart in a matter of seconds. Phenomenal.
B000002AZ8|5.0|Possibly my favorite Pearl Jam album if that's even possible.  Each Pearl Jam release is so unique in it's own way and this one is no exception, they kept the rocking going strong, still have great lyrics and meaning and even provide one of the coolest booklets I have still ever seen.  Great release.
B0000029AP|5.0|Second on the all time greatest Aerosmith albums list to the irrepressable ROCKS, Toys In The Attic saw the boys from Boston take flight and craft one of the all time classics of hard rock.It's most well known tracks are the uber cool \\"Sweet Emotion\\" and genre spanning \\"Walk This Way\\" which have been enduring radio staples for years. The album tracks are just as good. \\"No More No More\\" is a fantastic song detailing life on the road with great instrumentation, arrangement, lyrics and delivery with just a touch of sentimentality that makes the song one of the band's best. The album shows the band acknowledging their influences as well, \\"Round And Round\\" is Aerosmith at their absolute heaviest sounding with a thunderous Zeppelin riff while \\"Adam's Apple\\" is very Stonesy and would have fit perfectly on Sticky Fingers.The title track leads off the album and is a storming opener with great guitars and that classic repeating chorus \\"TOYS,TOYS,TOYS...IN THE ATTIC!\\". A must have for fans of hard rock pick this up with ROCKS today!
B00008OLIO|1.0|This is just polished glam music, not much substance, not much talent and just overall not anything worth remembering.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Too bad Stargate SG-1 had to end. It was my favorite show. At least we got to see the end of the Ori. Well done. Looking forward to the next movie, \\"Continuum.\\"
B0013BNY2Q|4.0|Coupla days ago, REM released their new album! Without any fanfare that I noticed. I checked their website as recently as two weeks ago. Out of the blue they suddenly showed up on the Colbert Report! Well, REM is my favorite band, so I was thrilled. I own all of their stuff, even career nadirs like Around the Sun and Up. I was practically holding my breath yesterday, just waiting to get off work. Not only is the sound harder-rockin', it has received some critical acclaim! Not to mention it's currently #1 in Amazon Music! W00t! REM!!! Ahem.     Okay, so what does the CD actually sound like? It's harder rockin,' that's for sure. Not since Monster has REM released such a straight-ahead, pick-to-the-business, fast-paced, rock album. The funny thing is, most of the frills that were woven into Monster are mostly gone. Here and there, some shimmering guitar work, but it mostly just sounds like another Rock Record. I've only listened to it a few times so far, but the album basically sounds very concise. Like, quickly done. Like, accelerated. They've said in the past that Life's Rich Pageant was written in something like two weeks, and I don't have any problem believing similar for this album. But whereas LRP explored various song structures, and weird themes, Accelerate mostly just sounds rockin.' This isn't really bad, but it's somewhat disappointing. Not as disappointing as say, Around the Sun, which had a very snoozy feel.     In comparison to other REM albums, it sort of reminds me of Green. Not that many tracks, couple of obvious singles, here and there some politics. Of course, Green came just before OoT, AftP, M, and NAiHF, a series of true brilliance. I can only hope this is the beginning of another zenith for REM. The other problem with the album is its length. At around 35 minutes, it's among the shortest records they've ever done. Trimmed the fat, obviously. I haven't really looked up from my terminal in a while, but I imagine the music industry has changed a lotin the last 10 years, so maybe this is an effort to appeal to a newer audience. Here's hoping they succeed.    EDIT: Some guy named Michael just won 8 gold medals. Quell Coincedance, ne?
B00000IL26|5.0|As many others have already mentioned, this album is definitely a gem.  Morgan and the rest of the group put together a solid album.  However, the standout track on this version is the second take of \\"Totem Pole\\" which was not on the orignal LP.  I've heard many a Blue Note album released with sub-par second takes but this version of \\"Totem\\" could easily have made the cut and is in some ways better than the album version.  If you have the LP and are condsidering it, it's definitely worth picking up just for this aspect alone.  Morgan, Henderson and Harris really push their instruments to the limits on the last track and the result is amazing!
0307346609|1.0|It was fun, in a mindless sort of way, but deeply defined by mid-20th century pop-history and lacking in any characters that were fully realized or sympathetic.<br /><br />I enjoyed it because I was ready for a break from thinking.  But it was, and remains, utter trash.
B000Q6GUTI|1.0|This movie is terrible. Where do I begin? Is it the lack of action? Is it the plot (or lack thereof) or is it the fact that the best shot of the movie was Wahlberg when he shot the beef stew? I was told this movie was \\"A smart, sharp action thriller in the tradition of Bourne Identity\\". There was way too much talking and not enough 'action' as the back of the DVD promised to give. It's a damn good thing that Hollywood Video didn't have this movie to purchase - so I only rented it. I only wasted $4.80 and after watching it, as sad as it may seem, I really would do anything to get that $4.80 back and buy something worthwhile. Those are my thoughts.
B00139B39E|5.0|Dream Theater is one of my favorite band in the world, and this complation gives you just a taste of there greatness.  In my opinion I think the Remixes of \\"Pull Me Under\\",\\"Take the Time\\" and \\"Another Day\\" are completely unnecessary.  The originals are SO much better, although it was interesting to hear what Kevin Shirley came up with.  I loved the addition of \\"To live forever\\", a really great tune.  Over all if you are just getting into Dream Theater, this is a great way to get your feet wet.
B0010X745K|2.0|The story is about a mist after a storm, (based on a story by Stephen King) that suddenly engulfs a small town and there are certain mysterious entities in the mist that devours people.<br />A group of people in a supermarket hide and stay for cover. The protagonist, Bill Drayton played by Thomas Jane, find ways to leave but are trapped inside the supermarket, if they try to leave, they get killed in the mist. Soon unable to bear the suspense of being holed up, a few try to escape but not with disastrous consequences.<br />This movie tries to be more a study of human behaviour in times of terrible conflict (as explained by Thomas Jane's character when he says, \\"Everybody is decent, as long as there is light and you can dial 9-1-1, once that is all taken away and your in the dark, what will you become\\"), but fails quite miserably in the process. The only truly remarkable actress in this movie is that of Mrs. Carmody, played by Marcia Harden, who plays a manipulative, despicable virago and doomsayer, that she really creates a hatred inside of you for her, when you see her role.<br />Overall, this movie would have been better if it had been directed well, but it fails quite poorly with average acting (except for the above mentioned) and cliched attempt at horror (when you realize the explanation of the reason of the mist).<br />Very average film, only worth at best a weeknight rental.
B0016BP0PW|4.0|this movie really was good and tastefully unique.Some parts dull down the movie while others are really good so i kept watching.... the end kind of leaves off in a cool way.<br />  i also loved the way they used the beatles songs for the events that were happening and the names of the charecters.
B00009W0U4|2.0|Plot-  A woman gets beat and raped by a man after witnessing a fight between him and a prostitute. The womans boyfriend goes to get revenge on the guy who did it.<br /><br />Sounds simple enough?... well, not really. The whole  movie is in reverse and if you thought Blair Witch was bad with the shakey cameras stay far away from this one. Even if you didn't think it was bad, this will make you dizzy. I don't know why the director kept filming scenes and making it look like the camera was going in circles but it did not help the movie.<br /><br /> If you like violence you'll love this movie. If you like to hear people talk about sex, party, and portray violence against women you'll love it. If you're looking for a good revenge story you may like it but I expect a lot more from a film than just that.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|although the movie may seem a little cliche  (really every movie is)it still has a great story line. The music will make anyone in love with music hair stand up on their arm.
B000TEUSJK|3.0|Caligula is about the Roman Emperor Caligula Ceasar. Set around 40 A.D. the movie centers around his reign, his love life and the terrible things both the Ceasar and the Romans did to eachother.     This movie was graphic in every single way imaginable though it definitely captured the decadance of this era. Caligula just got more and more evil as the movie went on and the last scene death scene took the cake.      Theres tons of sex in this. It can go from one extreme to the next in seconds. The parts with the actors I thought were decently acted, then it turns into one big mess. This would have been a lot better if you cut out a lot of the sex, it really went overboard. It was porn and the more and longer they showed the more you get distracted from the storyline and seriousness of the movie. One on hand I liked it because it told a historical story of an evil power hungry leader, on the other hand I didn't because it looked like an excuse to make a porn and show as much of it as possible.     Overall, I thought it was pretty good. I do have to say that at the end you will be happy what happens to Ceasar. Once you see this movie youve seen it all. This goes all out.
0156027321|3.0|An interesting tale of survival at sea, the Life of Pi offers a bizarre twist to the lost at sea genre.  The narrative style of this book is engaging but I found at times that I just wanted to get to the end of the book as some of the descriptions of Pi's days at sea seem to go on forever.
B000J10ERO|2.0|It is a shame that with all the resources at his command this is the best that Bryan Singer could do.    While the movie is obviously and heavy handedly about faith and the place it has in our cynical lives with Superman as a misplaced messiah, the choice of inserting it into the original Superman movie continuity did not benefit anyone.  Because as the audience has changed, so have the characters and their circumstances.    And therein lies the movie's main weakness.  It feels old and silly.  If I pay good money to watch Superman, I want to see him save the world.  Beat unsurmountable odds and defeat a gigantic horde that threatens Earth, or a formidable foe bent on terminating our very existence.    I don't want to see a ridiculous real-estate obsessed Lex Luthor.  I want to see a man whose very intellect signifies the height of human potential, and yet he selfishly chooses to use it for personal gain.    I don't care for an apocryphal super baby.  Don't they know that marrying Spiderman is widely accepted as one of the main barriers between the character and his readers?  Why get responsibility in the way of wish fulfillment?    I don't want to see Superman fight an Evil Continent.  I want to see him trade blows with Darkseid, outwit Brainiac or Luthor, heck, I'd even take Mongul.  Fighting an evil land mass managed to sink below the Hulk fighting a poodle in terms of sheer boredom.    And most of all:  Don't EVER hire a young actor to impersonate an old actor.  There is a reason Reeves was loved as Superman; he brought his own charisma into the character.    Things they got right:    Action sequences.  Special effects.  Photography.  Discreet and well paced story telling.  Kumar (Kal Penn) kicked Superman.  Kate Bosworth.  Gotta thank her parents sometime.
1594489505|5.0|It is amazing how the author can write so beautifully from a woman's point of view.  A cautionary tale for America:  tolerance of an intolerant religion like many sects of Islam leads to the absolute subjugation of women.  Why do people talk about the treatment of women in Christianity and say nothing about what Islamic law does to women?
159102594X|5.0|A true breath of fresh air in the fantasy genre!<br /><br />This is one of those rare books that is truly hard to put down. As with most fantasy there are elements of magic, unique creatures, love, betrayal, some great battles and some unexpected happenings. It has multiple, intriguing story lines, and a number of interesting characters (both good and evil) that I found difficult not to develop some sense of attachment to. It is fast paced and most chapters leave you itching to read on to find out what is going to happen.<br /><br />The telling of the tale is from several 1st person perspectives, giving you several different view points; this technique works well with this novel as there are many different personality types. The novel is also sprinkled with a lot of witty cynicism (particularly from one character).<br /><br />The only minor negative is that there is no  map. This would have been helpful because the story covers a fairly large geographic area.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />A terrific first book; containing all the ingredients of great fantasy. The story telling has all the quality and suspense of Steven Erikson's 'Malazan Book of The Fallen' series, but maybe without all the exquisite and elaborate details that is one of Erikson's strengths. However, easily worth a rating of 5 Stars.<br /><br />Addendum May, 09/08 *possible character spoiler*<br /><br />Having just finished this trilogy, I'll add this as a final thought...<br /><br />For all their accomplished skill, I don't think either GRRM (Ice and Fire series) or Erikson (Malazan Book of the Fallen series) have ever created an individual character like Sand dan Glokta. Glokta, with his villain-esque persona, is the unforgettable, physically grotesque 'cripple' in this tale; a character whose profession requires him to be the consummate liar (except, excruciatingly, to himself), who has instinctive, self-preserving insight into most 'situations' and provides us, the readers, with regular doses of witty cynicism. There were moments in these novels (involving Glokta) that were so sad and tender that they near moved me to tears (particularly this last book) and others that made me laugh out loud; of all the wonderful characters in this trilogy, it was Sand dan Glokta and his tale that I enjoyed the most.<br /><br />R.Nicholsong Glokta) that were so sad and tender that they near moved me to tears (particularly this last book) and others that made me laugh out loud; of all the wonderful characters in this trilogy, it was Sand dan Glokta and his tale that I enjoyed the most.

B000XFVIMQ|2.0|A third-rate third-in-a-series movie does not do any better in blu-ray than it does on VHS or Betamax. There is no noticeable improvement in special effects, much less an improvement in the poor scripting, shoddy direction and editing, and plodding actors. If you were thrilled by the originality of T1 and the action and special effects of T2, best to pretend that T3 was never made - but if watch it you must, save your bucks and rent it from Netflix, 'cause you'll never watch it again . . . and the extra you'd pay for the Ray would better be spent on a real classic (e.g. Forbidden Planet or Blade Runner) that you'll enjoy watching again.
B0013BNY2Q|4.0|background: an R.E.M. fan since my college days in 86, circa Life's Rich Pageant, after Up and Reveal, I swore I wouldn't buy another R.E.M. cd unless it sounded like... R.E.M.      so one day, i'm making instant oatmeal and i reach into the spice cabinet for some cinammon and sprinkle on a good dose of chili powder by mistake. on my first mouthful, as my brain registered the fiery sensation that was happening in my mouth, my eyes opened super-wide, roger rabbit-style.    so after all the buzz on this album, i had to give the boys another chance. when i heard the first track form this album, my eyes must have opened just as wide, this album is that good. a return to form, yes. if you like older R.E.M., you'll love this cd. and just like Life's Rich Pageant, the songs are all short, potent and just as memorable!!
B000XTLUW0|5.0|The CD/DVD combo is a must have for all Muse fans. The DVD is so much fun to watch and really captures the essence of this band. It starts with the band's entrance into Wembley Stadium amid the cheers of enthusiastic fans. Every thing starts out in black and white except for a few colorful pieces of clothing on the band members. Color seeps into the packed stadium when musical genius Matthew Bellamy strikes the first chord of his guitar. From there, its nothing but an artistically shot concert, full of energy and some of the best music on the planet. The camera is in constant motion, capturing the fervent enthusiasm of the both the band and the crowd. I enjoyed every minute of it!<br /><br />The CD is also quite good at capturing the spirit of Muse. Although you can hear the crowd throughout the CD, which maybe off-putting to some, I enjoyed the raw feel of the CD. While there aren't as many song on the CD as on the DVD, the most popular and many fan favorites are included.<br /><br />Overall, I think that this is a product that every Muse fan should have in their collection.
B0011UF792|5.0|A nice intended comedy, packed with a bunch of great actors, I've always been in love with Kevin Smith movies, but this one is so special, it was never released in my country, so I but the DVD a long time ago, now on Blu-Ray it looks gorgeous.    This movie is for all the Alanis Morissette fans, and those who have lack of faith, even for catholics with a sense of humor (like myself).

B000002WNP|5.0|This five CD collection features all of Elvis Presley's \\"essential 60's masters\\".  This does not include soundtrack recordings, gospel songs or live performances.  Elvis' 1960s recordings sometimes don't get much respect, mostly because many of the soundtrack songs were pretty bad.  But the non-soundtrack songs were of a much higher quality.  Nearly all the songs in this collection are very good.  A few unreleased recordings (mostly alternate takes) are thrown in to appeal to collectors.  This is a great collection that reevaluates Elvis Presley's '60s recordings.
1853268968|5.0|I've had this book since my teenage years and it's the one book I go back to time and time again. I don't know what it is that makes me grab it from the bookshelf, perhaps Conan Doyle's unique style, his descriptions of old London or the Grimpen Mire or the small village deep in the home counties, the knee high fog settling on the moor,I just don't know!<br />Watson's narration and Holmes deductions and logic never cease to thrill me and carry me away on an orgasmic journey of escapism. For that's what a good book does. That's what this book does.
0739334085|1.0|I gave this book a shot, but it is so tired and \\"obama-ish\\"  Never have I read a book with a platitude every other word. Annoying.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|Never having been a fan of Motley Crew (I think I may be a little young) I first heard Life is Beautiful on the radio and fell in love with the song.  That led me on a search for more information on the band members and the stories behind the album.  I'm always hesitant to buy an album based on one song, but I took the plunge and I don't regret it.     Realize that Life is Beautiful is very different from most of what you'll hear on the album.  What you will hear is a brutally honest account of the life of a heroin addict.  There's a lot of spoken word, pulled directly from the pages of Nikki Sixx's journals, but along with that are lyrics that will pull at your heart-strings and put you in the world of the addict - which is scary, depressing, and self-loathing.    The instrumentation is brilliant, almost symphonic, combining styles from all over the rock  universe.  Every song is unique, with a unique message and play style.  James Michael's voice makes you wonder why he's a producer and not a front-man for some huge band.  I haven't read the book  yet, but I think the whole album is perfectly understandable without it.       If you're buying this album for 13 different versions of Life is Beautiful, then just buy the single and be done with it.  If you're interested in a journey through a single man's struggle with addiction, then buy this album!
0143034901|4.0|Having anticipated reading this novel the entire time I was working my way through the last book I read before it, I eagerly opened 'The Shadow of the Wind' about five minutes after putting down it's predecessor.<br /><br />An intriguing premise, which I won't belabor the explanation of with 483 customer reviews here before me; but rather speak to what are, in my opinion, the strengths and weaknesses of the book.<br /><br />Strengths:  This novel, unlike many other 'mysteries' that I've read, slowly builds the story, while giving each character a personality, a motivation, and a reason for existing in the text. Of course not every person you encounter is completely fleshed out and integral to the plot, but each and every one of the major players is, in fact, well-drawn and well woven into the tale.  The parallels of the protagonist's journey here to that of his elusive 'hero', author Julian Carax, are subtle yet visible to anyone who pays attention to both what they are reading and what they have already read.  The author pays more attention to his characters than their surroundings, which I point out as a compliment to his skills as a novelist, as it was more interesting, to me, to envision the surroundings while knowing what the characters were thinking and feeling, rather than the reverse, as I've experienced in so many other reads.  The story is well developed, well explored, and interesting throughout.<br /><br />Weaknesses:  Roughly 3/4 of the way through the book, the author (using the voice of Daniel, the story's narrator) reveals a major plot point regarding the climax of the novel. I am unsure if the author's intent was to provide a major 'twist' to the book and hope that readers would continue to find out the 'whys and wherefores' of what is revealed, or if he felt that it was important to the plot development.  Either way, when I read this one line, it made me sit upright and say (out loud) 'How could you do that??? You've ruined all your suspense and anticipation of what the outcome will be???'.  Nevertheless, I kept reading.<br /><br />The other 'weakness' I would state would be that the ending of the book is a tad bit 'Hollywood' in it's structure and resolution.  One of my favorite ways a story as well-told as this is concluded is to have all things end as they 'should', but also in a realistic manner, no matter how 'fantastical' the elements of the story...and how you might think, as you are reading, that 'things like this just don't happen to ordinary people'.  While I was satisfied with the outcome for the most part, I still felt unable to suspend my disbelief that things would really have had such a 'pat' outcome for everyone.<br /><br />However, these two weaknesses aside, this is, as has been stated in the praise for the novel, a glorious read....a book-lover's book...a story with many twists and turns.  Fans of this genre of storytelling who might have read 'The Club Dumas' and other such tales will likely delve into this novel with relish, and find a highly enjoyable tale.utcome will be???'.

B00008G7UJ|4.0|I love this version because it is so different.  What a novel take on the classic.  While I agree that some scenes are not what Shakespeare intended them to be, I think the acting is great and the chemistry between Daines and Decaprio is unmistakable. I teach the play to 9th graders, then follow up with the movie.  They understand the play so much better after the movie, and I have had students each year who go out and buy a copy of the movie for themselves.  A great idea is to use the differences between the play and the movie as a teaching and learning tool and have students write about them.
B000065VB0|5.0|Peter Gabriel's third album, know by the distorted image of Gabriel on the front cover, as Melt, is without a doubt an awesome collection of prog rock music.  Everything Gabriel touches turns to gold on this cd.  The opening track \\"Intruder\\" is a great starter, setting a dark, sinister tone, with a steady drum beat, and gothic piano driving much of the song.  \\"No Self-Control\\" is song which captures the frantic pace of life, while making good use of a xylophone, with Kate Bush singing backup. \\"Start\\" is a slower instrumental piece, with a beautiful intermingling of synth and saxophone, played by Dick Morressey, a brief interlude before jumping into \\"I Don't Remember\\" a classic Gabriel track, ostensibly about the perils of an empty head. \\"Family Snapshot\\" is one of my favorite tracks, about an assasination, by a man who's grown up through a sad chilhood, his mother and father apparently divorcing.  A somewhat weaker track is \\"And Through the Wire\\", although it is up tempo, and gives me an impression of someone apparently looking through a wire fence of a self made prison.  Next is the classic \\"Games Without Frontiers\\" with Kate Bush singing in a sexy, breathy voice \\"Jeux sans frontieres\\", and reminds me a bit of \\"Lord of the Flies\\", I like the dark sense of this song.  \\"Not One of Us\\" is a song about conformity, or the lack thereof. \\"Lead a Normal Life\\" is a soft, somber piece, evidently about someone in a mental institution being told \\"We want to see you lead a normal life\\".  The piano is haunting in this track.  The last track is the phenomenal song \\"Biko\\", a tribute to Steve Biko, a noted black South African anti-apartheid activist who died after being 'interrogated'.  It's a powerful song, with a steady beat kept by Phil Collins, and Gabriel's emotional voice singing \\"Yihla Moja, Yihla Moja, the man is dead\\".  It's a song that always moves me, and one that will move you. As it ends Gabriel sings \\"And the eyes of the world are watching now\\", very powerful stuff.It's albums like this one that have given Peter Gabriel a well deserved reputation as a musical and artist genius.  I'd highly recommend this cd to anyone.
0375842209|5.0|This is a young adult book but due to the reviews we chose it for our book club. This book was unique because of the narrator (death). It also showed the story of WWII from a German citizen perspective, which isn't done as often. Liesel was a courageous young woman. As a mother of 3 daughters, she is what is known as the lovable stinker. Troublesome and naughty at times, but just one of those girls that you love with your whole heart. Truthfully the other characters are just as wonderful. Liesel's adoptive mother is about as abrasive and crude as you could get and still be called a good woman. However, I grew to admire her as a good mother and wife and a moral woman. This should be assigned to every highschool english student in America. Getting a well rounded view of history through literature is as important as textbooks. It is important to understand different perspectives surrounding these events.
B00021R7CG|4.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies! The senario is so hauntingly real that if you've ever served on nuclear alert(as I have), and had to sit for long hours inside a cramped B-52 just waiting........you understand. Of course the Director took liberties, sitting around waiting to go doesn't make for exciting cienma.I am proud of the role I had to end the Cold War and this portrayal is about as good as it get!
B0013FDM7E|4.0|The movie was good. Followed the story line of the original \\" Omega Man\\" pretty close. Just had more special effects. Liked the original best but this is worth watching. Some things need a bit of explaining,i.e. where did the girl and kid come from. Remember.....the bridges were blown up. Guess they took a rowboat?? All in all it was enjoyable.

B000FZERIG|5.0|I always admired George Harrison for not being afraid to sing and speak about spirituality. Not many artists back then were brave enough to take the risk of alienating their young party-hearty fanbase. Dylan (for example) wouldn't get around to writing overtly about spiritual topics until 1979's \\"Slow Train Coming\\". Maybe that's because he had a later \\"awakening\\", if you will, but my point is this: by that time he was a long-established star with nothing to lose. Dylan knew his fans would stick with him.    Harrison, on the other hand, came right out of the gate wearing his convictions on his sleeve. This was remarkable considering he had yet to prove he was worthy outside the confines of the Beatles. Though he was famous, no one knew what he was capable of on his own.     When he released \\"All Things Must Pass\\" (1970) after the Beatles break-up, the safe thing to do would've been to load it up with inoffensive pop/rock songs. Instead he chose to champion spirituality over materialism, and asked timeless questions like \\"What Is Life?\\" His thirst for knowledge and his love for Krishna (God) was un-abashedly declared on \\"My Sweet Lord\\". He could've easily encountered consumer indifference and fallen flat on his face. It's a testament to his talent that it didn't happen. Not only didn't it happen, but the 3-record set became the most talked about biggest hit of the year.    Harrison followed it up with \\"Concert for Bangladesh\\", while his fans eagerly awaited his next studio album. Their patience was finally rewarded with \\"Living In The Material World\\" (1973). Was it worth the wait? For me, the answer was a resounding \\"yes\\". In fact, I liked it even better than \\"All Things Must Pass\\". Heresy, I know. It wasn't as weighty and intimidating as his \\"magnum opus\\". I liked that it was only one record instead of three, and found it to be a succinct and beautiful \\"summing up\\" of everything I enjoyed about him. His singing and guitar playing, music and lyrics were all top-notch.Every song on it was great, which I couldn't quite say about ATMP.    Having said that, these two albums were his peak. Subsequent releases had many good songs on them, but were a little less consistent. The best of his later efforts were \\"Thirty-Three and 1/3\\", \\"George Harrison\\", and \\"Cloud Nine\\". If you are entirely new to him, the compilation \\"The Best Of George Harrison\\" is a good one. It contains some of his Beatles recordings and the early solo hits, while \\"Best Of Dark Horse (1976 to 1989)\\" covers later ground.    The world was a better place with Harrison in it. It turned out the \\"quiet\\" Beatle had a lot to say - and said it well. I suspect we'll be waiting a long time for another artist to assume his mantle.

B00000F214|4.0|I, like so many, obviously love this movie, if you are the 23 idiots that rated this a one then you obviously did that because you have a mainstream complex...meaning you need to be different, why, just because to be different.  With that said the movie is amazing, stay patient with it and it will deliver. BOTTOM LINE!      As for the Blue Ray, not impressed, is there a slight improvement, maybe. Buy this on regular DVD and own a classic you will watch multiple times!!!!
B000YXMMAE|5.0|After three albums (\\"Kid A\\", \\"Amnesiac\\", \\"Hail to the Thief\\") of restless and extensive experimentation, Radiohead go back to their roots (or not) on the gorgeous and delightful \\"In Rainbows\\". It's probably Radiohead's most accessible album since \\"The Bends\\", but instead of being a retreat, the band still manages to come up with something new. Thom Yorke recently said that this could be labeled as the band's \\"classic album\\" and this seems like a good assertion. \\"In Rainbows\\" is at once Radiohead at its poppiest (\\"House of Cards\\" may be the band's \\"cutest\\" song) yet retaining their edge and sonic complexity (listen to the layers and reverberating bass in that very same song). The album shows a warmer, looser side of the band, the polar ice caps of \\"Kid A\\" have melted and the bitterness of \\"Hail to the Thief\\" has tempered and the result is a more approachable, personal experience. This time around they've let influences such as Soul, R&B and Funk (listen to the beats of \\"15 Step\\") permeate their work. There isn't a single less-than-stellar song, even the short-ish \\"Faust Arp\\" is a beautiful nod to The Beatles' \\"Blackbird\\", and the album contains some of the most achingly beautiful songs the band has ever concocted (\\"Nude\\" and \\"Reckoning\\" are simply stunning).    It's as if Radiohead realized that they don't need to keep proving they're the most innovative band in the world and they just focused on making some damn great music and in doing so, still coming up with something original and wonderful.    \\"In Rainbows\\" is a great album, and it stands strongly as one of Radiohead's best.

B0013NAMGU|5.0|This is the second of four Agatha Christie films from the producers of MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS, and it's great fun. The inimitable Sir Peter Ustinov is Hercule Poirot, and his relaxing(!) Nile cruise is rudely interrupted by murder and mystery. His fellow passengers are the usual A-list assembly of stars, and there's an unusually high mortality rate among them--several murders and a few maimings. Everyone aboard wants to kill the beautiful heiress (Lois Chiles), and someone succeeds. Is it the crooked lawyer (George Kennedy)? The crooked doctor (Jack Warden)? The slanderous romance novelist (Angela Lansbury) and her nervous daughter (Olivia Hussey)? The larcenous lady (Bette Davis) and her grim companion (Maggie Smith)? The unhinged romantic rival (Mia Farrow)? Or is it her handsome, mysterious husband (Simon MacCorkindale)? Poirot gets to the bottom of it, natch, accompanied by eye-popping views of the great river and its tourist attractions, sensible direction by John Guillermin (THE TOWERING INFERNO), and a moody, graceful musical score by the great Nino Rota (THE GODFATHER, Franco Zeffirelli's ROMEO AND JULIET). DEATH ON THE NILE is one of the best Christie film adaptations. Highly recommended.

1591841666|5.0|\\"The extraordinary benefits of knowing when to quit (and when to stick)\\"<br /><br />Reading \\"The dip'' by Seth Godin was a revelation to me, so much so I read it twice! After only a few pages in, suddenly a light bulb flashed on as I had an \\"ah ha moment\\" followed by an \\"Eureka\\" encounter.<br /><br />I now knew how Archimedes felt when he sank into his bath after a hard day of maths and inventing as his bathwater cascaded onto the floor. Unlike Archimedes though, I suppressed the urge to dash naked through the streets to celebrate my more personal discovery (besides there seemed little point as it was evening).<br /><br />The dip answers life's questions like \\"why is life so hard?\\" and \\"why am I doing this?\\". Yet mostly it is a book about quitting. Not just any old quitting but \\"strategic quitting\\".<br /><br />Seth Godin informs us that anyone who ever told you to \\"never quit\\" is actually giving you bad advice. Why? Because sometimes you need to quit in order to move forward.<br /><br />The key to strategic quitting is to be aware of the dip and assessing if it is a dip that is right for you.<br /><br />The dip is the hard yards you put in before you make it. It can be many things depending on the goals you want to achieve eg. promotion, gaining market share, building an audience, learning a skill or developing relationships.<br /><br />If you are in the wrong dip you should quit or turn things around before you waste your resources pursuing objectives that lead to dead ends i.e. quit while you are ahead.<br /><br />This book will help you to decide whether to forge ahead with what you are doing or if you should change direction or quit. It is slightly slanted towards marketing, but the concepts can be applied to anything in life.<br /><br />I recommend \\"The dip\\" to anyone who feels like giving up their aspirations or is wondering \\"what's the point of all this work?\\" Read this book before you make any decisions.
0060523794|1.0|Never forget that Gerstner was one of the big dog tobacco executives before he came to IBM.    Although he was not one of the tobacco executives who took an oath and swore before Congress that he did not believe that tobacco was addictive, he ran the company just before the time of that testimony.  Tobacco was known to be addictive since at least 1932 according to the tobacco companies' own records.    Before you believe anything that Gerstner wrote or (more likely) had ghostwritten for him, always keep that in mind.
1400082773|1.0|B.H.O. wrote this book knowing full well that his primary goal in life was to serve as president of the USA. Fortunately today we can read today this book from his earlier years and see precisely why he is not qualified to be president. This book demonstrates in conclusive fashion why he was and is so attracted to the likes of Jeremiah Wright, Louis Farakhan, and his angry wife. He is a brilliant orator, an average writer, and a poor thinker with little originality. So, like most political auto-biographies, save your money and buy it used if you must read it at all.

0143038419|1.0|I wonder why I bought this book. I have not been able to get past a few chapters. How did it become a best seller? The author seems to justify her mistakes by trying to come up with good reasons. There are a lot of people in the world who are less fortunate than the author and have had more honest lives. Wish I had donated the money to charity instead.
B0013FYTA8|4.0|Okay, so a new TOAD CD is out, and all the Nickelback references are already being stirred up.  Let's get this straight, they were discovered by Nickelback, and Tyler has a very similar voice to Chad, but since when does that mean that just cause someone has a voice similar to someone else you gotta say all they make is generic crap?  Well in the end it shouldn't but sadly it does.  My word of advice, is if you liked any of TOAD's first stuff check this out, and sadly it's true if you like any of Nickelback's stuff you'll like this.      Though as a CD in general, if you like a hard rock ballad type CD you'll enjoy this.
B0013D8LOU|3.0|Tim Burton's film version of the Sondheim classic \\"Sweeney Todd\\" was generally raved about upon its release, although it didn't quite catch the attention of most filmgoers and the result was a success d'estime.  The raves were undeserved and, while the film remains generally entertaining, the flaws progressively take centerstage with repeated viewings.  The most obvious weakness, discussed rampantly on the internet, is the singing.  There is just no way around it - Johnny Depp and (especially) Helena Bonham Carter are no singers.  While Depp gets by and only occassionally lapses into a crooning pop sound, Carter depletes her songs of all energy and depth with her wispy voice.  Her acting is first rate however.  Depp is okay, but has anyone else noticed the mincing, half-smile grimace that is creeping into almost every one of his performances?  It's an annoying mannerism that is all Depp and no Todd.  Both performances are defeated, unfortunately, by the sound mix and Burton's direction.  Apparently told to speak in whispers, their mush-mouthed delivery is buried under the soundtrack to make much of their dialogue indecipherable.  This also hampers every other performance, the best of which is Sasha Cohen as Pirelli (although he, too, swallows many of his lines) and Alan Rickman as the judge followed by Edward Sanders as Toby.  The rest barely register.    Burton's direction is at times pedestrian, as in the \\"A Little Priest\\" section, and often uncertain.  He doesn't seem to understand how to make a musical move, so frequently everything just stands still except for those frenetic tracking shots.  But there's no style to the substance, and there are some shockingly lame computerized shots of London that look like they came from a comic book.  More destructively, the black humor is almost completely removed or sublimated, which has always been part of the fun of \\"Sweeney Todd\\".  It makes the film a very dark and dour experience.  That must explain the choice of the cinematographer, since the entire film looks like it was lensed during a blackout.  Important images are unclear or, literally, left in the dark.  We're not asking for another \\"Oliver!\\" here but, hey, let's not have London during the blitz, either.    For fans of \\"Sweeney Todd\\", the classic Stephen Sondheim musical, it's great to have a film version for posterity, even one that fails on so many levels like this one.  Still, it's hard to shake off the idea that this could have been, and should have been, so much more.

B000RIWAYY|4.0|This is the second time around for me on surfing with the alien.  I grabbed it for the remix and the dvd. The disc was a ground breaker and if you are just checking out Satriani this is great one to start with. If you know his music and enjoy and don't have this one, shame shame shame.  This may be from the 80's but it does not sound dated and was revolutionary in the way the guitar was played and recorded in the future.  How do you not love a DVD of Joe?
B000GUJYN8|5.0|This movie has a lot of different themes in one. From what society is told to value, and in a lot of cases pointing out the obsurdity of many things; even things like good soap. Edward Norton who's the narrator talks a lot at the beginning about what he does for a job, checking his companies accidents incase they need a recall. Whether he really dislikes this or not is left to the viewer. Insomnia plays a really big part of his life, and lot's of air travel for his job. He explains how he likes arranging and buying furniture to match a catalog, it makes him feel better.    One day the narrator decides to go to a help group, where his first time he meets Bob played by Meat Loaf. A somewhat strange character Meat Loaf plays. The narrator finds that he sleeps easier that night, so he goes to many different help groups contuing to sleep everynight.     One day when he is flying on a plane for his job, he meets Tyler Durden played by Brad Pitt. This is where the story takes a dramatic turn for the narrator's life. Tyler is not a polite guy, and seems to disapprove of Ed's character. They have an interesting conversation though, one of the many flaws with that he sees with socities ways. The oxygen masks aboard airplanes he says are uses to calm people, getting a high; though not really protecting you at all.     After the plane trip and the meeting with Tyler, he finds his condo room burned from an explosion. So he uses a card with Tyler's number, a soap company business card. They talk in at a bar for awhile, and Tyler says just ask me already if you need a place to stay. From out of nowhere Tyler gets the narrator to hit him. Then they fight out in a parking lot.  The narrator seems almost relaxed more after the fight, his attitude already is changing from the time he first meet on Tyler on the plane.    It's interesting to see Norton's character change, his condo room burning the only place he found an outlet from his job has him needing something else. Tyler introduces him to what he finds is really important, and it's not the way the narrator's life is. The both of them make an underground fight club, which Tyler tells all members to not tell anyone as a strict rule of joining. A lot of people from different classes of living join, you get the feeling they were seeking something different, their lives somehow not forfilled. Not unlike our narrator. The fight club forms groups of a different sort later on in the movie.    I like all of issues brought up in the movie, of valuing material possessions that can get the point of the only thing in some people's lives, feminising men to the point of no dignity, raised by single mothers being normal, not going for your real goals if they take along time to get there. These issues usually aren't popular to bring up in any movie, quite the opposite. The humor is also great at some points. The story is ever changing, not knowing where they're going next. Definetly a rare type of movie.

B0013BNY2Q|3.0|As a longtime R.E.M. fan, it's a relief to hear evidence that they haven't forgotten how to rock. Their post-Bill Berry releases have been, shall we say, erratic, with only one (\\"Reveal\\")approaching the level of their best work. \\"Accelerate\\" is  better than \\"Up\\" and makes a convincing argument that \\"Around the Sun\\" was just one big hiccup in an otherwise stellar career. However, a return to form it is not. It's a newer form of R.E.M.; leaner, while incorporating the sound and style of previous releases, principally \\"Document\\", \\"Monster\\", and \\"Life's Rich Pageant\\".  Is it as compelling or as exciting? Not really. After many listens, there are no outstanding moments or songs here. Part of R.E.M.'s legend was their willingness to swing for the fence, taking their more indulgent tendencies and create haunting, unforgettable drama. \\"Accelerate\\" doesn't do that,and perhaps it was not supposed to. What it does do is rock, and at this stage of R.E.M.'s sojourn, it's very welcome. I am deducting one star for the sonically compressed production. These songs would have benefited from some breathing room.
B000OVLNII|5.0|To read this book is to befriend Abraham Lincoln.  It is a very interesting and refreshing look at the leaders of our country in the mid 19th century.  I so enjoy the ability to look back 150 years and see the vision and inspiration of another group of Executive Office leaders.  The difference between today's and Lincoln's Cabinet seems to be night and day.  It is not that they didn't have philosophical differences, and it's not that they didn't try to submarine one another, but they each believed in something.  They were passionate about things.  The wishy-washy vote this way today and that way tomorrow was not the norm.  Lincoln did have his \\"feelers\\" out for public opinion, but Lincoln had a plan before the \\"feelers\\" went out, not just after he knew the direction of the wind.<br /><br />This book by Goodwin is superb.  I rarely give 5 stars to a book, but this one has earned it.  Sure, much of this can be found in various other works, but putting the focus on the Cabinet gives so much more flavor of the times, the philosophy and a wider view of the decision making.  Unlike \\"No Ordinary Time\\", Goodwin delves into the reasoning behind the decisions of Lincoln.  This is the best part of the story to me: The \\"How\\" of the decision process.  What was everyone thinking?  What went into the decisions?  How did it move from idea to history?<br /><br />The early part of the book is devoted to the years leading up the election of Lincoln in 1860.  This is extremely well told.  It takes the reader through the minds and actions of the four most significant candidates for that election and traces their steps - fascinating.<br /><br />The actual Republican Convention in Chicago is vividly told and shows how the Presidents were selected as the best compromise and the most likely to stick with the Party's platform.  The Party's actually had platforms and debated the merits of those proposals.  This book was a re-education in the National Process the way it was meant to be.  Not the mind numbing commercialization of the process today.  Stumping was really a way to hear the candidates.  Can you imagine any of the candidates in this year's election being able to say anything remotely meaningful for 2 hours?  That was normal for Lincoln, Chase and Seward.  And this book makes you a part of it.<br /><br />The writings and speeches of Lincoln were classic and this book while describing them, doesn't give much of the detail of them.  I did not find that this detracted from the story, I just wanted to mention it.<br /><br />Bringing together of his political enemies only makes perfect sense after reading the way in which Lincoln is able to make it work.  I would give anything to see it done today.  How else can you get the best of the best and listen to the arguments for and against. It was brilliant and brilliantly told.<br /><br />The final chapter depressed me for the entire day after reading it.  I knew he was assassinated, and I knew when he died and I knew that it was 150 years ago.  But after reading this book and getting to know the characters like I was never able to in the past, I really felt the loss of one of the greatest Presidents and even more importantly, one of the greatest Americans.cialization of the process today.

0452289963|5.0|Eckhart Tolle is a brilliant human being.  His ability to hold complex concepts in his mind about enlightenment, human nature and behavior while weaving in examples from the Bible, Buddhism, Taoism, as well as the world's greatest thinkers and artists, is impressive and illuminating.  In addition to being a spiritual teacher, Tolle is also a scholar.  The richness of his ideas and the way he presents and ties them all together reminded me of philosophy & religion classes I took in college (though none of those classes taught what Mr. Tolle is teaching!).    In \\"A New Earth, Awakening to Your Life's Purpose,\\" Tolle carefully and thoroughly describes all the facets of living your life with presence and awareness, rather than living out of the roles and inner thoughts by which we define ourselves.  At first, I found his ideas difficult to follow because of the terminology he uses (\\"egoic dysfunction,\\" \\"pain-body,\\" \\"form\\" vs. \\"formless,\\" etc.), but he always defines clearly what he means. Hanging in there to fully understand all of the lingo was worth it!  In fact, I really enjoyed some unexpected, simple and beautiful explanations of concepts that are often hard to describe. For example, his explanation of a human being:     Human is \\"...the functions you fulfill, whatever you do--all that belongs to the human dimension\\". Being is \\"found in the still, alert presence of Consciousness itself, the Consciousness that you are.\\" \\"Human is form.  Being is formless.  Human and Being are not separate but interwoven.\\"    \\"A New Earth, Awakening to Your Life's Purpose\\" is an exciting and important book to read, not just for your own personal enlightenment, but for the implications it suggests for the world at large.  If you are interested in both of these factors, then two other authors that are essential to read are Ariel & Shya Kane.  Their books [[ASIN:1888043180 Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment]] and [[ASIN:1888043040 Working on Yourself Doesn't Work: A Book About Instantaneous Transformation]] dovetail Tolle's in a way that is so wonderful and congruous: the Kanes talk about very similar concepts, but in a very simple, clear and profound way that actually allows you to experience enlightenment and awareness.  I strongly recommend reading the Kanes' books, in addition to Tolle's, to truly 'awaken to your life's purpose'!
B00006J3WH|5.0|Kicking and screaming, two years ago I finally agreed to watch a couple of episodes on DVD, and well, ended up watching all of them. On top of that, had anyone had told me that the musical episode would become my favorite, I no doubt would have smiled politely, uh, sure, whatever you say... Fitting, because this is the reaction I get when I've told other people about the series.    But now, as so many have already mentioned, this CD has become one of my all-time favorites. It's genius.    It's encouraging to see that good reviews keep coming.
B000MZHW40|5.0|This movie for me was very powerful and tugged at a lot of my emotions. It exposes so many horrible truths that too many of us are ignorant of. I felt that it was not overacted at all. Djimon Hounsou is a fantastic actor who portrays such pain and fear but also such hope. He makes you feel what he feels. And Leo DiCaprio fit his role exceptionally well as a man who discovers what is really right just unfortunately too late for himself. This movie is heartwrenching and touching at a very deep level. Wonderfully done!

B000WMEAKC|2.0|I have to say I was fairly disappointed with this album. Though it has a few tracks that really stand out as original and are worth replaying, there stands its problem. It's only a few tracks. Most of the songs are what I would describe only as \\"blah\\" though their advantage is that they don't sound like half the bands already out there. If they would record another album with a little more energy and variety it would definitely be worth listening to. Though I don't feel like this one was an entirely wasted purchase.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|This album gets bashed for being a sellout album, not like the old offspring but people don't seem to realize that bands change and that it is not bad.  I own all of their albums except for Ixnay and I think all of their albums are different and that is what I like.      The diversity of their sound is good, maybe someone will like their old cd's and not their newer stuff, maybe someone will like their new stuff but no their old.  Or maybe you can learn to appreciate all of their music because change is bound to happen.    This was the first Offspring album I bought in 5th grade and it was the first rock album I got.  I really enjoyed it then and still enjoy it now, even if I don't listin to it for a few months.  Each song is different, they range from humorous (Pretty Fly, Walla Walla) to serious (End of the line, Pay the Man).    This group has been around for over 20 years and I just love their sound, so different from all the other bands I have heard.  If you own their newer albums (Splinter, CO1, Americana) I suggest you try their older stuff (Self Titled, Ignition, Smash) Their self titled and ignition are both really strong album.    Make sure you lisitn to the album all the way through and more than once because their are many times when you won't like a song right away.
0066620996|1.0|As Mark Twain said \\"There are lies, dam lies and statics\\". Jim Collins missed the point at what makes a great company, Common Sense.

Too many satiations like Mr. Collins here. Keep it simple, use Common Sense, make great companies.
B000002AZX|4.0|Leonard Cohen, the debut album released in 1967 is a timeless, brooding, manostic masterpiece. It captivated me to the point where I listened to it almost exculsively for four months or more. I became so engrossed in it that once I put it on, I had to listen to it entirely, without interuption at least once, sometimes as many as four times consecutively. Did I flip out for any subsequant Leonard Cohen release? Well, Songs of Love & Hate comes closest. The Bob Johnston production mimics John Simon and the songwriting is top notch even for Leonard's high standards. But none of his other albums has the same impact or poigancy. Even Songs For A Room isn't as intimate or moving.     So twenty-something years later along comes Various Positions and I'm drawn in...Not like a first love that envelopes you, but a soft wisper that intoxicates you. I like it..I like it alot... I'm not back at that monastry and I'm not quite at that whorehouse either...Afterall I can't stop loving Suzanne and No I can't say so long Marianne. Until then I'll consider some various positions.
1400063515|2.0|Not only did this book not live up to the expectations I had for it, it was downright lousy.    A \\"black swan\\" is Taleb's name for an event that is unexpected, profound, and for which attempts are made to explain it retroactively.  The book purported to be about why it is so difficult for us to anticipate such events, and presumably what to do about it.  However, like The Tipping Point, the book never got beyond this initial premise and actually said anything.  There wasn't much to disagree about in the book and the author shares my overall sensibilities about the random way the world works, but there were absolutely no insights provided, and nothing to take away.    On top of this, the author himself appears to be a certifiable megalomaniac.  I've read works of fiction written in the first person where the word \\"I\\" appears less than in this book.  Almost every page is bathed in the author's reminiscences, anecdotes, unsubstantiated personal views, etc. -- none of it even remotely interesting, funny, or informative.  On top of that, the author shows remarkable and clearly enunciated disdain for just about every scientist or researcher, particularly those in the field of economics.  There are two or three exceptions of people whom he has personally elevated to the level of demi-god (of course these are all relatively obscure folks).  He essentially says that winning the Nobel prize should be viewed as a badge of shame.  What a supreme moron!
B000YM4I4S|2.0|I understand Schumann was not a master orchestrator and tended to over-orchestrate his symphonies.  But although Mahler cleared up the texture quite a bit, the overall edit and performance sounds like muzak from the sixties and seventies.  This music sounds lobotomized:  it doesn't sound like Schumann--or even Mahler for that matter--but it sounds much more like 101 Strings or Leroy Anderson.  And Chailly wasn't able to keep that tendency from occuring in many places.     This is an unsuccessful, if curious, experiment IMHO.  I would rather recommend Kubelik's performance of the original orchestration with the Berlin or Bernstein's with the Vienna (Heh!  Now there's a man has been known to edit the orchestrations of a few classics in his day!)      My two cents.
0375842209|5.0|'Here is a small fact. You are going to die'.  Zusak immediately plunges us into Death, both literally and figuratively.  Meet Liesel, a young girl who has seen it all before she even hits puberty: the death of her younger brother, the disappearance of her mother, and placement with a foster mother that rivals Joan Crawford. Her saving graces are her foster father, Papa, and her neighbor, Rudy Steiner.  Even though these men buoy her, Liesel must learn her own way in Nazi Germany, and she does by stealing books. As she learns to read, she immerses herself into the power of language and how it is used for both good and evil.  After all, who would the 'Great Fuhrer' be if he lacked words?     Packed with twists that you never see coming, I couldn't put this book down.  And it's become an epidemic: one of my students recommended it to me, and I began to read it.  Then, both my voracious and reluctant readers sniffed around with interest. Now, almost half my students have purchased this remarkable book and are swimming in the richness of Zusak's prose.

Johnny Depp, in another well-deserved Oscar nominated performance, is the revenge driven title character who returns to London to avenge his family by dispatching the corrupt Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) who had him falsely imprisoned.  Upon teaming with pie-baking Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter), Todd returns to the barber business in gruesome style, waiting for the right moment to exact his vengeance.  Such a film adaptation would more than likely have fallen apart were it in another director's hands, but once again, Tim Burton proves that he is indeed a flawed yet somehow visionary director that has really come into his own more than ever with his last few films.  The musical numbers are searing, the set design is spectacular, and the film as a whole manages to leave a lasting impression after its bloody and tragic final frame.  Also featuring Borat himself, Sacha Baron Cohen, in a small but nevertheless memorable role; Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a spectacular gothic triumph.  No matter how you may feel about musicals, give Sweeney Todd a chance, you will not regret it.
0226264211|4.0|One of the \\"readers\\" complained about the failures of the free market...I say 'readers' in quotations because the free market has never failed. There has never been a 100% free market in America, but instead a Mixed Economy...just as there has never been a free market in Africa or anywhere else. There have always been elements of Government control.<br /><br />The perceived failures of the free market have always come from special favors given by Government to businessmen...thankfully this book does Capitalism justice by refuting the very notion that Socialism resembles a valid political/economic system.

080701429X|3.0|Dr. Frankl is an author-psychiatrist who takes care of patient's problems by using logotherapy. In \\"Man's Search For Meaning,\\" he tells readers about his experiences in Auschwitz concentration camp, and how he discovered logotherapy by going through this horrible experience. In case you are wondering, the object and challenge and challenge of logotherapy is to put together ties of meaning and responsibility in people's lives, and actually make themselves feel important.    Dr. Viktor E. Frankl was a long time prisoner in various concentration camps. There he was stripped of his feeling of existence. His mother, father, brother, and wife were sent to gas chambers and killed. Everyone in his family, except his sister, unfortunately died in these concentration camps. He went many days without eating or sleeping, in brutally freezing temperatures. Knowing that every single day he was on the brink of extermination, how did he still find life worth living? That is what this book really sums up in one word, logotherapy.     All of Frankl's stories in this book ring true to anyone that suffered the tortures of these concentration camps. He views the human spirit with compassion and truth. It really makes his experiences worth listening to. Even though I, certainly, have never been in a concentration camp I felt that Frankl's words and feelings were shown greatly in his writing. It is definitely not a cakewalk to talk about your past when it has such a difficult history. This really shows that you do not have to be quiet about dark emotions. Do not feel burdened to be silent when you know you were the one who experienced such tragedies.    I have never liked reading about the concentration camps in Europe, because those thoughts are not comforting to someone who does not want to face the reality of it. This was very detailed and specific on all the accounts in the camps. Although, it also was very clear on logotherapy, so needless to say it was very dry. The message that the book made obvious to me was that we cannot forget the past, but cannot dwell on it either. The grass is always greener on the other side, and we always must move on no matter where life takes us.

I did not realize that this was not the full version and in fact was short sayings from the original book.  Although it might be appreciated by someone who found the original book helpful and could be used as reminders for implementing some of the thought changes suggested by the book, it was NOT what I wanted.

0743289692|5.0|This book is an insiders profoundly honest look at the parts of Islam that are tearing the modern world apart and that westerners must understand to truly deal with the impact. I have often thought that Islam needs to go through the same reformation that finally took the corrupted goals out of the Catholic church when they forced similar brutalities on people's of other faiths in terms of justifying murdering non believers. No religion who does this honors their God. This book is wonderfully written and the author beyond courageous for both her journey and her decision to shine a light on an area of Islam that must be reformed in order for peace to come to all nations.

I liked some of the ways that it tried to open women's eyes and see themselves in more positive lights, however it completely assumed that all men were cut from the same cloth.  It was certainly interesting, but I found it flawed.

B00009VTX8|5.0|The Quick And The Dead<br />[Superbit Version]<br />(8.5/10)<br /><br />Back in 1995, director Sam Raimi was at a bit of a crossroads.<br />After his accomplishments through the Evil Dead series, yet<br />not yet to his A Simple Plan/Spider-Man level, he made<br />this fast paced Western that in alot of way feels like both<br />time periods of himself. However, this Western plays differently<br />than most revenge types, with a secret woman (played<br />amazingly well by Sharon Stone) joining in a town's shoot-out<br />competition with the intent of seeking revenge on the town's leader (played by Gene Hackman, just on the over-the-top edge). Along the way, we meet alot of the town's faces, including future stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe, as well as character classics as Tobin Bell & Lance Henriksen just to name a few. Simply put, this is a great cast for a movie with the then \\"Evil Dead\\" guy. But it works. Well.<br /><br />While considering 90's Westerns like The Unforgiven & Dances With Wolves to be more classy & important than this flix, it definitely holds it's own, fitting perfectly with say Tombstone or Silverado. Yet this flix probably gets less attention than any of them, and it shouldn't. If you missed Sam's classic camera-in-your-face angles, or his quick as lightning cuts, he didn't lose them here. The showdowns are intense, visual, and the audio mix superb. And though Stone lost what little credibility a long time ago, this movie showed she could be taken seriously as an actress, fully dressed even!<br /><br />Many have seen this play over the years on cable, but<br />the true way to see it is on this Superbit version. While this<br />release was done back in 2003, it's picture and DTS audio is<br />miles ahead of it's inferior single-layered original disc. Colors<br />bright & rusty, sound full of body, and bit rate always at<br />the fullest. I guess my only complaint is that they really didn't<br />try to remaster the actual print first due to a few, a few, blemishes on the print here and there that the high bit rate only brings out more. But believe me, for now I can say I've never seen this movie this good.<br /><br />Downside is that this movie has alot of deleted scenes including a romance between Stone & Crowe & a wedding with Bruce Campbell as the minister! Too bad cause the Superbit, nor the regular, has them & International cuts only included the romance in the movie. So, I'd probably buy it again for a Raimi Director Cut, which after seeing the movie, you'd probably agree.<br /><br />A good, fast-paced, 90's style Western that doesn't ever slow down. Featuring a female hero that you could actually believe in, as well as a cast that looks like they're in good hands with a director that finally got to do a Western with a little visual flair.

0765318741|4.0|I can't explain exactly why I enjoyed a horror novel about zombies so much. But I did. Beware that I Am Legend, 160 pages in length, is followed by ten short stories.<br /><br />The tale begins in January of 1976 with a tall, thirty-three year old blue-eyed blond man named Robert Neville fighting for his life in Compton, California. It covers his experiences for the three years that follow. He has survived a plague that, in its earlier stages, causes persons to become weak, sick and affectless. In later stages, victims transform into vampire-like creatures that shy away from the usual: daylight, garlic, and crosses. Magyver-like at times, Neville, drinker, smoker and classical music aficionado, has been able to sustain himself through his ingenuity, living in a boarded up house adjacent vacant lots (having burned down the neighboring homes) complete with an adequate supply of food, a generator, and means of transportation. By day, he patrols the area in a search of the plague afflicted. Those he finds are killed for good and disposed of. He also spends time at the library, researching blood and diseases in hopes of finding a cure. With a lot of idle time on his hands, he thinks back on his family, the circumstances surrounding their infection and fate. Additionally, he reflects on his former relationship to a persistent nemesis as well as the likely reason for his survival. Especially good are his encounters with other possible survivors, the vocabulary, and the plot. Although I loved the story I Am Legend, it ended too soon, since I thought the book contained just one story and plodded on to the second short story that followed before I realized it had ended. \\"I Am Legend and Other Stories\\" may have been a better choice for a title.<br /><br />The short stories ranged from okay to good. Prey, on which one of the three stories from one of the scariest movies I've ever seen (as an eleven-year-old), Trilogy of Terror with Karen Black, was based, was non-stop action packed horrifying. Some of the others: seven teen witches use their powers to help fight a war, a man meets with a mortician to get \\"the best\\" for his wife, futuristic kids visit a bar where they see a plague riddled \\"woman\\" dance, an intelligent anthropologist takes on the role of witch doctor to save a person possessed, and a man experiences the incessant sound of a phone (or something) ringing in his ears. Similarly great choices: The Lottery and Other Stories by Shirley Jackson, The Tell-Tale Heart by Edgar Allan Poe, and The Road by Cormac McCarthy.ng.

B0013FXWVU|4.0|In 1953, a doctor named Seuss wrote a book,<br />It is really quite good, you should have a look.<br />There have been many films made, in the decades since,<br />Based on the doctor's other works, most would make you wince.<br />Turns out, all it needed was some fine work by comedic actors,<br />And a lot of great, colorful CGI animation to bring the doctors<br />Work to life.<br /><br />Horton (voiced by Jim Carrey), an elephant who roams the jungle of Nool, is a mentor - teacher to the younger animals and a bit wacky in his own right. One morning, while bathing, he hears a tiny voice and realizes it is coming from a tiny speck floating by his ears. He saves the speck and allows it to land on a flower. But Horton is the only one who can hear the tiny voice and Kangaroo (voiced by Carol Burnett) wants to prove decisively Horton has made a mistake; as the leader of the jungle, she must be right and more importantly, prove to everyone else she is right, including her son, Rudy (Josh Flitter). But Horton heard something and soon begins to communicate with the Mayor of Whoville (Steve Carell) who has 96 daughters and a young son named JoJo with his wife, Sally (Amy Poehler). Things are always good in Whoville, so when the Mayor begins to communicate with the voice from the sky, he begins to realize they may have some trouble on their hands. But no one in Whoville will listen. Kangaroo asks Vlad (voiced by Will Arnett) to help her stop Horton and maintain the status quo. Horton decides the only answer is to take the small speck to a safe cave on the top of Mount Nool. But there are more than a few obstacles along the way.<br /><br />Co-directed by Jimmy Hayward (who comes from Pixar and \\"Robots\\") and Steve Martino (who also worked on \\"Robots\\"), the use of CGI seems to be the perfect medium to bring Seuss to life. Think about it. All of Seuss' drawings have roundness to them even though they are primarily pen and ink drawings, everything is always moving and bent, and CGI lends itself beautifully to this. The same film, done in traditional two-dimensional animation would be a very different beast. It might more faithfully capture the look of Seuss, but the ability of CGI to capture lifelike details helps to make these characters come to life.<br /><br />Given the status of the original material, it is a classic of children's literature and many generations have and will continue to grow up reading the work of Dr. Seuss, it is important for the filmmakers to stay true to the spirit of the original. I was initially concerned about the lack of \\"Seuss\\" I heard in the trailer but was pleasantly surprised to find they retained most of this for the narration, which is voiced by Charles Osgood. Naturally, when you take an illustrated book which is probably forty pages long, it becomes necessary to extrapolate and add to the source. When the characters speak, they speak in more normal, human patterns, leaving the Seuss-isms for the narrator. Normally, this is exactly the type of thing that would set me off and begin pulling apart the story, the performances, and the animation. But in \\"Horton Hears a Who\\" it works. Carrey and Carell, and the rest of the voice cast play it pretty natural, allowing the dialogue to speak for itself.<br /><br />This doesn't mean that Jim Carrey doesn't do a little bit of `ad lib'. Much like Robin William's Genie in \\"Aladdin\\", Horton is a `free spirit' and ends up talking to himself. As he walks through the jungle of Nool, it doesn't take a lot to set the large, kind elephant off on a tangent, playing different characters, talking to invisible animals. Carrey does a very nice job with the character, adding some of his trademark, fast-paced humor while retaining the innocence of a character created for a children's book. Carrey's Horton imagines friends and places that aren't there while playing and interacting with the creatures that actually exist. Horton is a fun loving guy and a joy to watch.<br /><br />SteveCarell plays the Mayor of Whoville. With a huge family of 97 children, one of which is his son, he has a lot to look after. But Whoville is a magical place where nothing ever goes wrong, so he doesn't have a lot to worry about as Mayor of the strange little town. Carell brings his trademark energy to the role, making the Mayor a bit scattered, but in a playful, enjoyable way. He seems as though he would not have it any other way.<br /><br />Because the people of Whoville live without problems, the Mayor finds it difficult to convince them when he begins to realize something is wrong. When the weather begins to change erratically and there seem to be intermittent earthquakes, the Mayor soon realizes something is wrong. Then, he begins to hear a voice. Horton is communicating with him and it takes a little bit of convincing for both of them to accept they are talking to others; the Mayor can't believe he is talking to someone outside of his world, Horton can't believe he is talking to a living being on a speck sitting on top of a flower. But they each come to believe the other and set out to work together.<br /><br />\\"Horton Hears a Who\\" seems designed to be a parable for the problems in the world, and since it was written in 1953, I can only imagine what Seuss might write today. The legend is he wrote \\"Horton\\" shortly after a visit to the recently bombed Japan and modeled Whoville after some of the cities he visited. Perhaps the most famous line, \\"a persons a person no matter how small\\", is retained in the film and used a couple of times. The message of this sentiment is pretty clear and resonates even louder when you consider the inspiration for this book.<br /><br />\\"Horton Hears a Who\\" is the first modern adaptation of a Dr. Seuss classic that gets it right. Forget the abysmal live action versions of \\"The Grinch\\" (which also starred Carrey, but under a lot of latex and make-up) and \\"The Cat in the Hat\\" starring Mike Meyers.

B000AOEMXM|4.0|It has been two years now since \\"Star Trek: Enterprise\\"(hence STE) has been taken of the air and with it the whole Star Trek-franchise. Whether or not this forced hibernation will be of a permanent nature remains to be seen. Many see STE as the major contributing factor for this state of affairs.  STE has the unfortunate distinction of being the most reviled installment by the Star Trek community and has come perilously close of being disavowed as being Trek at all by that same community.  How did this state of affairs arose? When the producer duo Berman/Braga, responsible for three very successful installments of the franchise, announced that a fifth installment would be a prequel eventually leading up to events depicted in the Original Series and subsequent series, expectations ran high in the community. Fans were hoping to see the formation of the federation, the Romulan wars, the foundation of Star Fleet and other events merely mentioned or hinted at in the other series. What they got in the first three seasons was less than expected and then some. Resistance from the fan-base was vehement to put it mildly.  To make a prequel, be it in TV-shows, movies or books is tricky business at best. Contrary to sequels, doing a prequel, writers have to be very, very conscious about the continuity and the established frameworks of the whole, which constricts their literary leeway in no uncertain measure. Successful prequels therefore (as unfortunately proven by the Star Wars-, and Highlander Series), because of violations against continuity and framework are far more rare than successful sequels and unfortunately STE is no exception.  It can be argued that it already went wrong with the intention to whom the series should appeal. Berman and Braga are on record of having stated that it was their intention that STE should appeal to both the fan-base and to novices to the whole Trek experience. This was therefore the main reason why the series at first was simply called \\"Enterprise\\" without the prenom \\"Star Trek\\" as not to shy away potential new viewers (let's face it the Star Trek Community has a reputation not too appealing to non-trekkers). But it also meant that those new viewers were not to be burdened with too much reference to established Star Trek lore so as not to loose them. So from the very first get-go a potentially disastrous tension-field and a lack of direction was already built in and it has proven to be thus. It was precisely the perceived lack of reference to the established Trek lore that alienated so many of the fan-base in such a vehement way that it attracted nationwide attention and drove away the intended and now bewildered new viewers. In an effort to appease the fan-base \\"Star Trek\\" was added to the series titles in the third season and finally in the fourth season all pretenses of attracting a new audience were dropped and an all-out attempt was made to regain the loyalty of the fan-base. Too late as it turned out to be, the studio by then had decided to cancel the series. Because of all the clamor, the series failed to attract a new audience and die-hard fans turned their backs to STE in droves, driving ratings into the ground. Ironically, in hindsight, it was \\"Star Trek: Voyager\\", although not originally intended to do so, which attracted the most new audiences, because the premise of that series was far more suited for that (a ship lost and totally out of touch with home, so references to established lore could be reduced to a minimum and therefore be pallatible for novices, a luxury STE because of its premise could not enjoy). To date Voyager is the most well liked Trek series amongst non-trekkers.  A recap of the fan-base's major gripes with STE shows that it falls mainly into two categories, casting/performance and continuity-issues.  Casting/performance: Scott Bakula suffered especially in the first two seasons from intense criticism in his portrayal as captain Archer. True, he comes across as an unstable character with unresolved anger-issues, who is better situated on a therapist's couch than on the captain's chair. His evident dislike of Vulcans is borderline bigotry. Were I in Starfleet Command, he certainly would not be my first choice in leading man-kinds first interstellar diplomatic mission. But be aware, this is of no fault on Bakula's part. He has proven to be a fine actor in his other work, so the fault entirely lies with the writers, who were unable to find a direction for his character in the first two seasons. They were trying to make Archer into a cross between Kirk and Picard and succeeded in neither. As an actor Bakula must have been very frustrated of the lack of direction the writers were giving him. Finally in the third season, because of the long story-arc, Bakula was able to come to grips with his character and made it his own and developed it further in the final season. Kudos to Bakula in pulling this one off, for he was given very little to work with. It is mystifying why writers had such problems of beefing out Archers character (the producers lack of sense of direction is the only reason I can come up with), because they had no troubles at all in making A.G.Robinson (Keith Carradine in 2nd seasons \\"First Flight\\") or Erica Hernandez (Ada Maris in 4th season's \\"Home\\" and \\"Affliction\\") completely believable and stable commanders in only a few scenes (two characters I would have chosen over Archer to command the Enterprise at any time, although Hernandez got her own command).  The same criticism has also been uttered in more or less degree regarding the other characters. Here I tend to disagree. Each character had from the beginning a far better direction than the Archer character and have been written for as such. With the exception of Mayweather (who has proven to be very difficult to write for character-wise) each character has been given enough screen-time to beef out their personalities to a satisfying degree, thereby debunking criticismthat the secondary characters didn't have enough screen-time. They had far more screen-time than the secondary characters in Star Trek The Original Series (hence: TOS) ever had. And remember their acting and that of The Next Generation in the first two seasons or so was far more wooden than that of the performances in STE (thereby debunking yet another criticism). And yes, some characters come across as too down to earth or annoying. But remember STE takes place far more closer to our era and shortly after a series of destructive wars than to the subsequent eras were people tend to be far more \\"enlightened\\". We people of the early 21st century are rather annoying and self-destructive, so their portrayal looks true to me. And if you want to hear a really sobering view of us 20/21st century humans, listen to what Picard has to say about us in TNG's episode \\"The Neutral Zone\\". Personally I believe that by then the fan-base was so frustrated by what they have been shown thus-far that they would grab any stick to beat the horse with, justified or not.  Much also has been said about the gratuitous sexism especially in regard to the T'pol character shown in STE. True the nerve-pinching sessions have been overdone a bit too much, however in the decontamination scenes one might argue that the characters were overdressed. It defeats the purpose of decon by wearing contaminated clothes during decon-sessions as any employee working with hazardous materials can attest to. Even Jolene Blalok purportedly complained about the sexism. However to claim that it in any way diminished her character is a blatant exaggeration. Being blessed with nice curves did not in anyway whatsoever meant that T'Pol was not being portrayed as a strong and intelligent woman, because she was. Furthermore veiled or not so veiled sexism has always been a staple of Star Trek (it is well known that Gene Roddenberry intentionally liked it thus) or are we forgetting Yeoman Rand (TOS), Counsellor Troy (TNG), Jadzia Dax (DS9) and Seven of Nine (VOY) in all of their tight fitting outfits and which was more or less accepted and even poked fun at (\\"...and they wore less...\\" states Dax dry-witted as she dons a female crew uniform of the TOS-era in DS9's 5th season \\"Trials and Tribble-ations\\"). Furthermore on a general note, it is a fact of life, it is even biology that most men like to watch women and that most females like to be watched by men, as amply proven by a multi-trillion cosmetics-, and fashion industry. To seriously try to deny this, is to deny human nature itself and smacks of hypocrisy. Unless Phlox, McCoy, Crusher, Bashir or The Doctor comes up with some sort of a hormone repressant, it will remain a fact of life for some millennia to come, deal with it.  Continuity-issues: My personal feelings are that these are the root-causes of the problems STE encountered and that the above issues more or less resulted from this.   It already starts with the rolling of titles. Had it absolutely to be \\"Enterprise\\"? The series firmly established that Archer and his Enterprise are of pivotal importance in creating the Federation. However no mention of him or more importantly his ship are even hinted at in the other series. At least a depiction of his ship should have been on the plaquette walls of all the subsequent Enterprises, so here already is the first discrepancy and one that could have been so easily avoided in giving the ship another name, any name but Enterprise, \\"My Nana's Old Broomstick\\" would even have sufficed. It seemed Berman/Braga could not resist the temptation of the lure the name \\"Enterprise\\" holds (let's face it, when hearing this name one thinks not of the first atom-driven carrier or the carrier of World War 2 fame) and thereby in the process defeating their own intention of attracting a new audience. It was obvious that Berman and Braga had gotten high on their own supply as further examples will show.  The aliens-issue has also been hotly debated in thefan-base. It appears we are living in a very crowded corner of the universe. Archer has met more new aliens than Kirk and Picard combined. And most of them appeared to have died out since, because most of them have not been hinted at in the other series. True there are fortunately a few familiar races Tellerites, Vulcans, Andorians, Bolians, Nausicans do make an appearance but there are too many newcomers. In all of the other series and movies there have been ample scores of aliens of which we know little or nothing about and most of them as background which could have been highlighted in STE, without loosing storytelling possibilities. Nothing wrong in introducing new races, but the sheer magnitude defies credence, remember at this time earth's sphere of exploration encompasses only a couple of dozens light years.  And then there is the issue of introduction of alien races we are familiar with. Fans were baffled by Vulcans behaving more like Romulans, Ferengi which were not supposed to be encountered for another two centuries or so (TNG's \\"The Battle\\"), and the same goes for The Borg (Although there was a logical rationale for this, as stated in the writer's audio commentary track on the dvd, it was intended to clean up the -borg-mess after the events depicted in \\"First Contact\\", unfortunately it didn't came across on screen, resulting in more \\"time-line\\" foul-ups). One of the more serious breaches of established lore was the too premature introduction of Klingons, already in the pilot-episode. This also was not to have happened for anther 50 years or so and it resulted immediately in a very hot cold war (TOS's \\"Errand of Mercy\\" , \\"Day of the Dove\\" and TNG's \\"First Contact). A far-fetched attempt was made to bring the Klingons back on collision-course by having Archer get into a fallout with a powerful Klingon family. Again it seemed that Berman and Braga could not resist the temptation of using proven popular aliens even when it meant that continuity had to be broken.  Another issue which caused much discomfort amongst the fans is the issue of technology. Sure enough, STE started well enough; no phasers, no transporters, no photon torpedoes, no shields no nothing of the all too familiar technological gadgets so much intertwined with Star Trek-lore, The NX-01 had to do with missiles, armored plating, laser guns and shuttles to go to and fro and that just looked and sounded right, But much to my (and many others) dismay, all of these star trek tech goodies were very soon introduced and firmly in place by the end of the series. What this suggested is that for the next 200 years or so no significant technological breakthroughs (especially in the tactical department) would be made, only improvements in their efficiency and this is really trying credence. The first pilot and a couple of the first episodes of TOS for example, strongly suggested that phaser and transporter technology were fairly new by then (in the pilot \\"The Cage\\" set about a century after STE, they were still messing about with laser guns and McCoy's reluctance to use the transporter speaks for itself). It is true that Roddenberry wanted to have all the technology shown in his creation to have a scientific base, and by this day and age almost most of them have, at the very least on a theoretical level, with one glaring exception though: transporters. For the reasons why, you might want to read the chapter dealing with this in Krauss' book \\"The Physics of Star Trek\\". It is well known that Roddenberry was forced to come up with the transporter as a Deus ex Machina because of budget restraints (there simply was no money for shooting shuttle-craft scenes transporting our heroes to and fro), so it was one of the few tech items shown which was a pure flight of fancy, So to suggest we have this technology already available in a century or so is again stretching believability to breaking point, especially since it played again the part of Deus ex Machina in quite a few crucial episodes of STE. As an extension of these arguments, the fan-base also had gripes with the designs of the starships shown, i.e. they looked too modern in comparison with the ships shown in TOS. Here I've to disagree to some extend. Every effort has been made to make the ships \\"clunky\\" enough. What is true however that the ship's configurations lack imagination, i.e they (at least the Earth and Klingon ships) looked too much already as their 200 years later descendants. [Edit: Since the writing of this article it has come to light that where the designs were concerned, what was eventually shown on screen did not always met with approval of the conceptual artists and designers, many of whom were genuine fans. Since then some of them have started blogging and it could be discerned that most of them had a different opinion of what a \\"proper\\" design lineage should be, but were met with fierce vetoing from the executive producers, who wanted a recognizable \\"Trek\\" look, again contradicting their stated intentions. In one case the artists were put in their place by the producers by disallowing a hard worked design and using a model from the earlier series, creating an awful anachronism. By reading between the lines it becomes clear that the tension levels between producers and creative team had risen substantially in this stage of the franchise.]  A final issue is the storyline discrepancies. I already mentioned the untimely introduction of alien species. Further examples are: Spock being the first Vulcan to serve in Starfleet ? Neh, been there, done that in the form of T'Pol...The V'Ger incident being the first planet wide emergency, again, neh here come the Xindi, blasting away at Florida and Central America and I can go on for awhile. But what is even worse, two major elements have been introduced with major repercussions for everything henceforth : \\"The Temporal Cold War\\" and \\"The Xindi Threat\\", Granted the first event could have  been explained away by an extensive cover-up, but not the second one, since it blasted away huge chunks of Earth, Since this event represented the very first time that Earth faced imminent destruction at the hand of extraterrestrials (at least in the Trek-Universum) it is very unlikely that this would not have been  referred to in any of the other series (since every other Earth threatening event, from the Eugenic Wars onwards, has been referred to)...  To anybody but the fan-base these points sound to be trivial, however for the fan-base it is of crucial importance. Trek has become in the last four decades an ongoing legacy, established within its own framework, To commit violations against that framework is, for them at least, a serious offense and as a (not too fanatical) fan I tend to agree. I have to admit that when I was watching the specials and hear Berman state that they did everything to ensure the continuity of the Trek Universe, it was for me quite a toe-wrenching experience since it was so obvious that this was not the case. The things Berman/Braga did get right from the start were the firm connections with the events depicted in the movie \\"First Contact\\" and the inferred events depicted in the TOS-episode \\"Babel\\", namely the troublesome beginnings amongst a couple of the founding races of the Federation (Vulcans-Andorians-Tellerites).  So now then, is STE a bad sci-fi or a bad Trek-series? Well actually NO!!! Not only was it quite good sci-fi, it also was quite good Trek. I for one enjoyed the series quite a lot from the very first get-go, Yes, I did get bothered as a Trek aficionado by the discrepancies described above, but unlike the fanatics I could get past that and enjoyed the series for what it was. Ironically, the first two seasons (the ones most reviled by the die-hard fan-base) were in spirit (\\"To boldly go where no one has gone before\\") closest to the TOS than any other of the Trek-incarnations. Every episode, they did get to visit another situation just like the old TOS, or have we forgotten that? And true there were some lame episodes, but doesn't this also held true for every other Star Trek series?  Let's be honest here \\"The Next Generation\\" had more than its share of lame episodes during the first three seasons, but we stuck by it and we got rewarded for it from the latter half of the third series onward (granted, TNG did not have any whatsoever competition at the time). In our days TNG would not have lasted one season. Every Star Trek series (with the exception of TOS) needed time to find its footing and pace. Each of them found it in its second or third season, that's how the format worked (after TNG there was only a year or so to come up with the premise for a new series). To compare them with very successful shows like \\"Babylon 5\\" and  \\"Battlestar Galactica\\"(the new series) is unjustified...In the latter cases the creators spent many, many years to beef out the premises and story-lines, whereas the last three series of Star Trek only had one year each. In the case of Babylon 5 for example, once the original story had been told (four seasons), the franchise staggered considerably with its spin-offs (none of which successful) as is also the case with  \\"Galactica\\", where the producers already announced the end of the series, ending it on a high note rather to let this quality-series depreciate itself. One could argue Berman/Braga should have done the same with Trek after \\"Voyager\\", that the world was \\"tired\\" of Trek, that the franchise should give it a rest. Well they did not. They gave it another run. The results are well known. No matter how I feel (and yes, quite a few others as well) about the first two seasons, they proved a rating disaster for all the reasons I stated above. The long Xindi story-arc of season three went a long way to improve the series in no uncertain measure (a very outstanding season by anybodies standard, were it a sci-fi series not associated with Star Trek, it would have been a hit), but it strayed even further from the Star Trek-Universe.  So by the end of season three of STE the whole franchise was in serious trouble, Berman/Braga saw the writings on the wall and they both scurried for cover, like Ismay (the general manager of the Titanic, who sneaked his way on board of the few lifeboats) finding employment elsewhere, a very ignominious way to end very distinguished careers in the whole Trek-Universe, but at least they gave us the gift of handing over the reigns to a very gifted man, named Manny Cotto, He, aided by equally gifted writers like the writer couple Reeves and others, possessed with a thorough understanding of the Trek-Universe produced a fourth season of STE, firmly establishing this incarnation with the rest of Star Trek-Lore, finally telling stories the fanbase have been waiting to see:  -)A story-arc dealing with the fall-out of the Eugenic Wars, resulting in a link not only with TOS but also with TNG  -)A story-arc dealing with the fact that Vulcans of STE differ so much with the rest of the Trek-universe, which by the  way did (in hindsight) not sounded too far-fetched. We do have a 20th century equivalent in the form of communism...It too strayed a very, very long way from its original writings and intentions (if you do not believe me, read Marx's \\"Das Kapital\\" and compare it with its eventual outcome). Were Marx to appear in Red Square in the 50's he would certainly not have been so lucky as the katra of Surak in STE (Stalin would have seen to that).  -)A story-arc dealing with how latter day Klingons do not look like as TOS Klingons (in reality because of budget restraints there was no money available for elaborate make-up), something I as a star trek fan was not really looking for, but got nevertheless in a brilliant piece of spin doctoring, turning the too premature introduction of klingons into an advantage explaining this.  -)A story-arc dealing with the coming about of the Mirror-Universe, an absolute fan favorite. Not only does thisarc explains how the Terran Empire came to be (without any cross-overs from our Trek universe), but we also get to see a TOS-starship operating in the STE-era. And believe you me it is most gratifying to see a ship designed in the 60's to perform so well in a show of the early 21th century. Not only was this show an absolute homage to TOS, but in my mind at least, it also was a subconscious rebuttal to the fans who claimed that the STE-ships were too modern looking... Seeing the Defiant making short work of STE-era ships was never a stretch of believability...I for one can not think of a greater homage to the late Matt Jeffries, the designer of a timeless starship...His creation can still hold up to the very best this CGI-driven era can generate...  In hindsight, the fourth season proved to be the most popular amongst the primary audience i.e. the fan-base for which the prequel should have been intended all along. The one issue I have with the last season is this: It all seems to be a bit too forced, and actually it is. Most likely Manny Cotto & Co. must have sensed that this season would be the last (and it was proven thus), so in order to cement this series with the rest of the franchise a lot of stories had to be told in a very short time. The sad irony is that were some of the arcs of the fourth season spread more evenly over the previous three seasons, STE would have had a far better survival chance than it had; Then Berman/Braga  would have had the opportunity to achieve their goal of satisfying two very distinct target audiences.  Conclusion: So did STE heralded the end of the Star Trek Franchise? Well, yes and no. In no way did STE spawn the downfall of the franchise. It's third and especially its fourth season did show there was life in the old gal left yet. Were we living ten years earlier STE would have been given a chance to further develop into a full fledged trek series, it definitively had the potential. However we are not living ten years earlier, nowadays a new show has to go off with a very strong premise from the very start even to have a chance to go into a second season. And this is exactly were STE failed. Not only was a certain patience still expected from audiences (which was no longer there) in order to find a specific pacing in the series, but this misjudgment was also further compounded by a lack of direction as described above. If I have been too critical about Berman & Co. then I must tone it down right now, for they have given us literally hundreds of hours of marvelous entertainment in the Trek Universe, stronger even, they've given the franchise a second lease of life and let us all not forget that. So if they have given us two disappointing seasons, remember they have also given us twenty two seasons of satisfaction, no small feat. The only fault I can find with Berman & Co. is that they have seriously underestimated the changes that took place the last ten years in the world of TV-dramas. That being said, I can not see any of the newcomers, no matter how good they are (and I can name but a few, all of which I do no see having a lifespan of more than four-five seasons), of being able of building a legacy like that of Star Trek...Many have said that Star Trek (beginning with VOY) as a format has become \\"tired\\"...Well I personally do not agree with this assessment, I would rather say that Star Trek is not \\"in vogue\\" for the time being. Only time will tell if this will be of a permanent nature, but then again Star Trek has risen from the dead before...(although times have changed considerably, Paramount auctioned off last year a considerable part of their trek-paraphernalia, thereby giving off a very strong indication that we will never again see a re-appearance of any of the Trek-incarnations thus-far). If in the future a new incarnation is to appear, remember, don't get burned on making a prequel (It seems however that this warning has come too late, because at the time of this writing a new Trek movie, no.11, is in the make and yes it's a prequel, dealing with the young Kirk and Co. The director is on record that he will not take into account established Trek-lore, thereby opening up the possibility of driving home the last nail in the coffin of the franchise. We will have to see if this will indeed be the case).  On a final note I would like to comment on the DVD-release. Being the last Trek series produced, well into the DVD-era, it is no surprise that the DVD release of STE is quality-wise amongst the best in the whole franchise. Sound and picture are excellent, presentation and format are very satisfying. The price-level is as usual with paramount productions (as far as Star Trek is concerned), rather steep, but okay we have gotten used to that and since we are Trek-fans, we'll cough up the dough.  My gripes, as with all the other Trek editions, are with the extras. Yeah, they are done expertly (this being a truly DVD-era product, even more so, i.e. most of the extras were pre-produced as being extras for the dvd-releases), the inclusion of the bloopers is a very nice touch and the commentaries, both text and audio are very insightful. However as usual, little attention is given to starship design as is the case with every other Trek-dvd incarnation, further fueling the frustration of many modelers, who are to this day in vain waiting for a comprehensive reference work (be it in writing, or on dvd) on Trek Starships (it defies belief that a franchise as venerated as Star Trek is not able to produce a single solid reference work on their starship designs, whereas even the most obscure sci-fi series like Lexx is able to do so). And for that matter the whole process of what is making the magic happen is somewhat under-lighted, as in every trek dvd-incarnation. Furthermore any critical note is missing from the extras as is usual with trek releases. Hardly any mention is made of the criticism stated above, although it proved to be very instrumental in thechanges made in the course of STE and thereby the franchise as a whole. But this is hardly surprising, it has been a policy of Paramount to make the extras on any Trek-dvd release into glorified ads...  So now that all has been said and written, how do I rate this series? I still give it 4 stars, solely because I have been able to watch as a stand alone and very much enjoyed it as such, especially the 3d season. The 4th star is firmly deserved due to its 4th season, which so much warmed my Trek-heart. It is my hope therefore that opinions will become milder as time passes on...
B0008GNJZY|5.0|I wish there were more stories like this.  Discipline properly applied and reward for the effort and hard work.  Life-changing experiences for those students.  I recently met the REAL Coach Carter at John DiLemme's Find Your Why and Fly Main Event and he is just as inspiring in person as the movie.  This story gives hope for our children.
B000TUXL2A|3.0|I really like most of Knopfler's solo works, but Kill To Get Crimson is just too bland. The lyrics tell some interesting stories, but musically, the tunes are neither catchy nor memorable, and the tempos are too homogenous (with the lone exception of the more upbeat \\"Punish The Monkey\\"). Perhaps more egregious is that none of the songs highlight Knopfler's uniquely stellar guitar skills, nor do any showcase his ability to rock. There's nothing outright bad on this disc, but it lacks spark. Nobody's going to kill to get Kill To Get Crimson.    Added Note: I saw Knopfler in concert recently (after posting the above review). He put on a fantastic show, and if anything, I'm even more convinced that this CD misses the mark. If you don't find this review helpful, go ahead, buy the CD and judge for yourself. But don't say nobody warned you.
B0013BNY2Q|4.0|R.E.M.-Accelerate *****<br /><br />Honestly when word first leaked that R.E.M. was releasing a new album I much like many R.E.M. fans was excited but didn't expect much. My lack of amazing was due to the fact that the last five R.E.M. albums were decent but really not that great. But Accelerate, wow, what a return to form. The boys seem to be back in touch with the original feeling that made them want to create great rock n' roll.<br /><br />Then one day 'Supernatural Superserious' came on the radio after the \\"here's the new one from R.E.M. introduction and I was floored! The song presents everything I have ever loved about R.E.M. Michael Stipes fantastic performances of intelligent lyrics that aren't so smart they become pretentious. The genius that is Peter Buck giving melodic a whole new definition for maybe the tenth time in his career.<br /><br />Accelerate is a stripped down guitar based rocker thru and thru. The hype surrounding the album was monstrous and absolutely true. From the killer start of too true opener 'Living Well Is The Best Revenge' through the first single 'Supernatural Superserious' and the incredible 'Houston' which may just be the best song the band has recorded since the Document album. The album closes with the fun yet somehow haunting 'Im Gonna DJ' making giving Accelerate a five star rating the only option.<br /><br />To say that Accelerate is the best album R.E.M. has released in years is but a mear understatement. This easily contends with the best of R.E.M.s releases and is tied for best album to come out since 2000 with Radiohead's In Rainbows.
0439813786|5.0|My entire family has loved this book--grandparents to parents to my 12 year old daughter and 8 year old son.  We all have very different tastes in books, but each thought this was a good mystery and very fresh approach to writing and illustrating.  I'd highly recommend it!
B000002H72|5.0|The Pixies-Doolittle *****<br /><br />There has never been a more accurate comparison then that of Kim Deal and Black Francis mirroring the way that Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong worked and sounded together. And yeah Kim Deal kicked serious business with The Breeders, and Francis Black is one of the most amazing solo artists to ever attempt it but it was when they were together that they made some truly amazing music. Doolittle is basically the darker counter part to the bands most successful album Surfer Rosa.<br /><br />Playing hop-scotch with intensity and melody jumping and skipping from smooth melodies and angelic vocals to sharp sheering guitars and shriek filled screams, The Pixies are what punk should have turned into in the late 1980's and 1990's. 'Tame' may be the best example of the band playing hop-scotch. Always big on the theme of religion and the current situation in the world The Pixies were easily one of the most intelligent and original bands of all time, 'Monkey Gone To Heaven' is easily the most touching song on the album and best example of the power of the group. Songs like the surf rock sounding 'Here Comes Your Man' sounds like Dick Dale meets The Supremes in one hell of a recording session. Other tracks like 'Debasser' 'Wave Of Mutilation' and 'Crackity Jones' showcase on of the greatest albums of all time.<br /><br />With the release of Doolittle and Surfer Rosa, The Pixies would make it okay for bands like Nirvana, and all those other Sasquatch-flannel wearing-alt. rockers to do what they do, even though none gave credit to The Pixies it is easy to hear, especially on such a great album as Doolittle.
B00008YJH5|5.0|The Pixies-Surfer Rosa *****<br /><br />I seriously debated with myself whether or not to even review Surfer Rosa due to that simple fact that for me personally with this album there is no way for me not to be biased. This has truly been one of the most important albums in my life.<br /><br />In a nutshell Surfer Rosa is easily the strongest and best Pixies album ever released, and aside from that it is honestly the best album to emerge from the 1980's far surpassing Appetite For Destruction, The Joshua Tree, Rain Dogs, and anything else you can think of.<br /><br />The true mix of hardcore and pop make Surfer Rosa a knockout. Black's sneering vocals and lyrics of incest and pain among other things is to say the least, breathtaking. Kim Deals vocals are the best they ever sounded, even better then with The Breeders.<br /><br />The rocking fun of 'Tony's Theme' aside classics like the manic 'Cactus' and the albums opener 'Bone Machine' make Surfer Rosa not only amazing but eclectic. The insanity of 'Broken Face' 'Break My Body' and 'Something Against You' are so violent yet beautiful it baffles you. 'River Euphrates' is beyond explanation while Deals 'Gigantic' is so near perfect its strange. The final four songs on the album are a juxtaposition of Mexico and punk that somehow make this album essential but would ruin anyone else's. But the center piece of Surfer Rosa is the haunting 'Where Is My Mind' which is once again the best thing the group ever did as well as the best song to emerge from the 1980's. The song is among my personal favorites and honestly brings tears to my eyes upon every listen.<br /><br />To summarize quickly, Surfer Rosa is essential, it is more important then any album of the 1990's because well it inspired them all, and it is always refreshing to hear so it is one that I will recommend to everyone who likes music.
B0013BNY2Q|3.0|Yes, it's far more exciting than REM has been for awhile...but it's also lacking some of the mystery that made this THE band (for a certain set) in the 80s.    The main culprit is the production. Loud, brash and revved-up, each track is raring to go from the git-go. And that's a good thing, for sure. But everything's mixed up front (even the background vocals), leaving very little to discover on repeat listens. Accelerate lays it all out, right away, and there you have it. Nothing mumbled, nothing held back, nothing hidden away for later.    I'm glad that REM is finding ways to excite themselves again, and they shouldn't be beholden to fans who want them to make Reckoning again (and again) all these years later. But I can already feel this one wearing itself out, winding itself out, and sending me back to the IRS records for another round of discovery.

B000WGZGNS|4.0|To make things clear right off the bat--This is a ladies show made by the ladies for the ladies! All the performers, with the exception of 4 male dancers, were female, and the 4 that weren't female definitely catered to the female audience!    Now on to the Best Parts:    *This show began with a bang! Beyonce popped out of the stage floor with a glamorous gown tightly fitted over her curvaceous body. Midway into her singing, prancing, and booty bouncing through her hit \\"Crazy in Love\\" she snaps the tail of her dress to reveal a dress more fitting for the \\"uh oh\\" dance. Then she meshes in the mega hit \\"CRAZY\\" by Gnarls Barkley, and heads on straight to her crazy adlibs.  *For Freakum Dress Beyonce added a lil stylish soul and aggressive rock to the pop number, creating a really sexy combination!   *On Me Myself and I Beyonce sings a more soulful, smoky, and heartfelt version of her 2003 hit \\"Me Myself and I\\", making this my personal fave of the night.  *On Dangerously in Love Beyonce smoothly mixes in a lovely melody by Jill Scott, the Underground hit \\"He Loves Me\\". Although this was no comparison to Jill's booming yet more masterfully skilled vocals that i had heard just the previous summer at the Suger Water Fest, Beyonce did her thing and gave a pleasing performance.   *Another highlight was Beyonce's performance of Upgrade U, her current urban hit with hubby Jay Z, who unfortunately didn't show up at my concert, but laid down a tight verse on the DVD version.  *The Destiny's Child Medley: Smooth. Really shines even without the other DC members. Really cute performance of \\"Soldier\\".     However this DVD does have some downsides:    *some songs were shortened so much that they were ending just as I was getting into the groove  *Beautiful Liar (performed WITHOUT the queen of hipshaking Shakira) and Dreamgirls were really boring and have no purpose for being on the DVD.   how i regret not going to the bathroom during these time-wasting spots.  *no extra features on the DVD,   but special features usually suck anyways, and its absence doesn't really hinder the overall captivating and energetic essence of the show  *Suga Mama was a real let down for those who deemed this their fave song from Beyonce as I did. Most of this amazing song was lip-synched as Beyonce took a whiff of a cigarette and stripper-danced around a pole throughout the first and second verses of the wonderfully candy-laced song(which you really can't see from where I was at the 80th row). It wasn't until the bridge that beyonce began to sing (and believe me you can tell the difference). Although she added some crazy adlibs at the end, I just wasn't satisfied. Frankly, I was expecting the same exciting energy-filled, hormone-induced performance she gave for \\"Work It Out\\" in her less than stellar Dangerously in Love Tour.    Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this concert and the DVD; from its live band instrumentation to live backing singers with their powerful voices and great harmonizing skills (a grade or two up from the way beyonce's former group members, Kelly & Michelle, would just stand around and lip-synch the chorus as shown in their guest appearance during \\"Survivor\\").     I was certainly entertained by the sexy male dancers, the shiny, fashionable, gowns (in silver, my favorite color!), Beyonce's excellent stage presence, eye-catching choreography, as well as her energetic and estrogen filled performance. I especially enjoyed the female empowering theme present throughout the whole show! Nonetheless, men will enjoy the sexy ladies on stage, from Beyonce, to her stunning dancers, and be enraptured by the power of catchy beats combined with glitter and extensively polished yet at times soulful vocals. Despite its few let downs, it is compensated for by its many benefits and cheap price, making it a wonderful as a gift or an addition to your own DVD collection. 4.5 Stars.

Both my husband and I felt when we met that we were soul mates and after reading this book I truly believe it. What other explanation can there be when you meet someone and find an instant connection, a bonding with the person? Why else do you finish each other's sentences, know exactly what someone will say or do even shortly after meeting them? Since reading the book we are now both highly interested in past life regressions to find out exactly where we were together in past lives.

B000003BD3|5.0|I was in college when this came out.  I guess it was only released in the UK and probably on TV.  Still it brought back memories of the time - 1968. Everyone looked so young in the video, still the music was great especially if you want to see the Who and the Stones and what they looked like 40 years ago.  The production was perhaps a little amaeturish but still a fun watch.
0060594896|5.0|This is a good self-help book on goal achievement.  It contains many case studies of people who have applied certain principles to overcome extreme odds.  The first chapter starts off with taking full responsibility for your life.  What you have is mostly what you created.  Jack Canfield talks about handling rejection, taking risks, asking for what you want, clarity in your goals and how to move on when something is not working.  Throughout the book, there are several websites to visit to assist the reader.  Some of the websites are promotional pieces.  I have to admit that I was not impressed with Janet Switzer's coaching program.  I got called up during my honeymoon to hear a pressure sales pitch that would have cost several thousand dollars for long-distance coaching.  Not my idea of a good time.<br /><br />The book itself is like the Chicken Soup for the Soul series in that wherever you open the book, there are inspirational stories to give you that extra boost to keep on going.  I like Canfield's blunt approach to his principles, especially because he is a walking example of them.<br /><br />Doug Setter, Bachelor of Human Ecology, author of Stomach Flattening and One Less Victim
0385522401|4.0|I had several hours one cloudy morning and spent it cuddled up with this novella.  I'd not read McEwan before.<br /><br />His narrative skill was considerable.  I found myself tranported back to the early 1960s and able to enjoy a mental cinematic which was furnished by the author.  The protagonists were sympathetic and McEwan did a good job of fleshing them out, Florence better than Edward, although Edward's parents were very well detailed.  As an enthusiastic amateur musician, I enjoyed the research and/or skill that McEwan brought to Florence's area of expertise.<br /><br />This is a case study in failure to communicate.  The author allows us to see what leads up to and then follows a catastrophic misunderstanding.  In The Unbearable Lightness of Being, Kundera treats us to a chapter in which two lovers both see the same things in completely different ways.  This is the thesis of McEwan's present little novel, the whole story of which pivots around a honeymoon encounter.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed this book, although I found a bit of Edward's dialogue on the beach to strain what I understood of his character.

And I will never say that I understand what these men and women go through. But because of everything these men and women go through they have my undying respect and admiration.    I have recently read a book by a Navy Seal. In this book it describes everything from going through indoc to BUD/S training to the central reason for the book, a mission in the mountains of Afghanistan to the aftermath of said battle. I don't think anyone can actually know what they went through just by reading a book. But it does open your eyes to a different state of mind that you have to have on a battle field. The book is titled Lone Survivor by Marcus Luttrell.    If you are remotely interested I suggest you read the book. I read it in a week. Less than that. I couldn't put it down very long. This book isn't all military good......afghanis bad.....in fact the author talks very highly of a certain village that took him in when he was the only one left. He even calls it his village. A good book. It gives you a lot to think about. Why even put our soldiers in that position? I understand that there are a few really bad apples out there that would do something stupid. But to paint a broad brush over our entire military that they couldn't make the right decision when the time came is ridiculous.    Like I state above I have no clue about military life. I don't know all the in's and out's about battles. But my eyes were opened up to something new when I read this book.
B00005BCNC|5.0|Video arrived sooner than I'd expected and in excelent condition, like brand new. We watched the movie last night and throughly enjoy the performance given by the entire cast but especially by Tom Hanks.
0743486285|5.0|very good book! Its amazing what this man went through and is still alive to tell the story about it.Its amazing you could do that many drugs and still be alive. Nikki Sixx is an amazing person. I couldn't keep it down. I just loved it!
0452289963|5.0|EXCELLENT!  EXCELLENT!  EXCELLENT!<br />This book is my BIBLE.  Every DAY I open the book at random and read a few lines.  It has made a big difference in my life also in the lives of my family.  I would like to meet with a group once a week and discuss this whole book beginning with page one.  It<br />would be a great benefit to all of us.  This probably is not going to happen here but I can dream and have my own learning session every day.

0452289963|5.0|Having studied and read many books during the last 30 years about the inner self and truth,  I find this book of Eckhart Tolle's to be the most important book ever written on this subject.
B0013BNY2Q|1.0|Almost all songs on this CD are totally lacking a melody line.  Listen to the lyrics - they are mostly mono-tonal. With the exception of Supernatural Superserious, the CD lacks the catchy R.E.M. sound that I was hoping would be recaptured on Accelerate. Also, the recording is not crisp, again, with the exception of Supernatural Superserious. Interesting how it almost sounds like that song was recorded intentionally cleaner, to make for better radio play in anticipation of the debut of the CD, so we would all expect (I did) that this would be the sound and song quality of Accerelerate.  Much to my dissapointment, it wasn't.
B000EOTAM6|3.0|As you've read in other reviews, this movie cannot be compared with the animated series. That having been said, it was worth seeing once just because the locations and costumes were so cool. But the story was just too conveniently tied up, and Trevor was recast as a thoroughly virtuous goody-goody who happened to have an evil brother (I'm surprised he wasn't an evil twin). It would have been tough to make the animated series into anything cohesive, but the characters in this film are just too nice, too Hollywood, not believable. Even Aeon has lost her sadistic streak. And Peter Chung okayed all this, according to the \\"extras\\" on the DVD! Not a great movie, but well-made mindless entertainment (probably not for the hardcore Flux fan).
B000002IQW|5.0|Skid Row was just another Glam/Pop/Hair-metal band (as heard on their 1989 eponymous debut album), but then in 1991, to keep up with the overnight popularity of Grunge/Alternative Rock, Skid Row reinvented themselves as a hard-rock-esque type band and made thrashier, more rocking songs than on their debut. The only trace of Glam Metal on this is the ballad here and there (\\"Quicksand Jesus\\", \\"Wasted time\\"), \\"Mudkicker\\", \\"Get the _ _ _ _ out\\" and the title track \\"Slave...\\" are the loudest, most thrashy songs on here.      \\"Slave to the Grind\\" is a GOOD BUY, WORTH THE PRICE, and is SKID ROW\\"S greatest relese. the 12 tracks of this album are what got me back into a few Glam Metal bands.
B000RK3JOC|5.0|I loved the book. I think John Green writes with his audience in mind and really connects with them. The book is about a guy named Colin who was a basically a child prodigy. His goal in life is to make himself matter. Colin , along with his best friend Hassan, venture out on a road trip for adventure and end up finding so much more about themselves. This book really gets you to think and connects with the teenage mind.<br /><br />Thank you for your time<br />and feel free to comment<br />this review,<br />Loran
B00000634J|5.0|Outstanding words and music from the Man who made us all think about the finer things in life.  I also recommend \\"Across the Universe\\", on DVD, for all you diehard Lennon fans.  Great story and music.  Thanks very much. Ron Caylor
1577314808|5.0|As an avid participant in spiritual and personal growth workshops and seminars for over 20 years, \\"The Power of Now\\" naturally came up in conversation as a recomended read. I found Eckhart Tolle's discussions about spiritual principles to be both straightforward and enlightening, reiterating lessons I had learned through my own personal experience.<br /><br />I particularly liked his very clear discussion of the pain body in the chapter entitled \\"Consciousness: The Way Out of Pain\\". Here he describes how emotional pain becomes an entity that, once we've identified with it, takes over and feeds off negative experience, attracting even more negative experience into one's life.<br /><br />Tolle's concepts are ancient philosophy told through the voice of wisdom gained through personal experience. His question and answer style is easy to read and relate to, and makes it easy for the reader to come back to later if time is needed to process information presented.  In many ways, \\"The Power of Now\\" reminds me of the style and content of teachings given by Krishnamurti, another great modern-day teacher.<br /><br />I recommend this book for both beginning and advanced students or teachers of spirituality that have a leaning toward \\"new age\\" or \\"new thought\\" models of spiritual truth.
B000WTZ784|3.0|This, the final release from Genesis (so far, at least it seems), will perhaps remain the most divisive album in the bands' lengthy career. In case anyone is unfamiliar with the controversy, Calling All Stations is the album where Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford carried on as Genesis without it's longtime vocalist/drummer Phil Collins (who had departed the band in the mid-90's). Phil Collins had become such an iconic figure within the band that replacing him would seem an impossible task. The solution? Try something completely different...<br /><br />Enter Ray Wilson, a singer whose style and range is closer to original Genesis vocalist Peter Gabriel without being an obvious sound-a-like choice. As tiresome as I had become of Genesis' songwriting direction from the pleasant, if unmemorable, [[ASIN:B000WTZ78Y We Can't Dance]], I still had my doubts about shifts in the songwriting team and anyone stepping into Collin's lead vocalist role. Wilson's voice isn't as versatile as Collins, it's more restrained. Even so, his performance on CAS serves the music just fine.<br /><br />I've heard some claim that CAS is a return to the bands' progressive roots. I don't find that claim to be accurate. To my ears it's more like a darker, moodier version of a Genesis 80's record (and that's not meant as an insult). Admittedly, when I first heard CAS a few months ago (as part of the [[ASIN:B000WETHXU 1983-1998 Box Set 5CD/5DVD]]), I wasn't impressed. It sat on the shelf for a few weeks, until curiosity pushed me towards giving the material another chance.  Then, with a couple more spins, it all started to come together for me.<br /><br />This album is dominated by ballads, conveying a variety of moods that are sometimes sweet (\\"If That's What You Need\\"), desperate (\\"Shipwrecked\\"), or mournful (\\"Uncertain Weather\\"). The title-track is the clear standout for this album; Mike's slicing guitar riffs brush up against Tony's icy keyboard sounds to set an ominous backdrop for Wilson's impassioned vocal performance. Also not to be overlooked is the fantastic drum work of Nick D'Virgilio and Nir Zidkyahu. Listen to the great drum work on the intro for \\"The Dividing Line\\", it holds up to any percussion work Collins recorded with the band.<br /><br />As with the rest of Genesis's discography CAS is remastered with improved sound (although being just released a little over 10 years ago it probably needed the boost the least). On the DVD disc are excellent promotional videos, concert performances, and interviews. Unfortunately, the one item that should be here that isn't are the complete B-sides from this album, of which there were many. Those tracks are only on the bonus disc of the above-mentioned box set, and even there the collection is incomplete.<br /><br />First impressions are important, and those without patience were probably quick to dismiss the new Genesis without giving the material time to really sink in.<br /><br />FINAL RATING: 3.5 out of 5<br />Favorite tracks: \\"Calling All Stations\\", \\"The Dividing Line\\", \\"Uncertain Weather\\"

B000LZ6ZEY|4.0|saw at a local fle market so i bought it because i am a kraftwek fan, took it home loved it, i love the way vinyl sounds, and no i'm not old... my friends always laugh because i get excited when i find a record i want and this was one of them. I love electronic bands(early 80's preferably), i love bands like Visage, Simple Minds, Talk Talk and many more but Kraftwerk and Visage are my favorite and I will go everywhere to get my favorites on vinyl. I wish I could find more German Kraftwerk albums though. If you're a true fan you would get your hands on this album.
B000UCEJEQ|5.0|I personally believe Annie Lennox can do no wrong. With that said, it does make me sad that the wait between projects from her is so long.  But this album is well worth the wait. Being able to preorder on this site is a blessing. And this album is an amazing work of art. From the power of \\"Dark Road\\" to the desperate longing of \\"Fingernail Moon\\", there is not a bad track in the mix.   Her new signature song \\"Sing\\" (which was influenced by the please of Nelson Mandela to be aware of the AIDS pandemic) brought together over twenty of the top female recording artists. Singing about solidarity and that no matter who tries to bring you down, you can win.  It's truly Annie's world, and we just live in it!

B00000016K|4.0|Please Note: This review is for the DCC Gold Edition of \\"Wheels of Fire\\" NOT for the regular edition.<br /><br />Double albums were all the craze when Cream recorded \\"Wheels of Fire\\". Since this legendary and short lived band didn't have the material for two albums worth of material and their live shows were legendary, the trio of Jack Bruce, Eric Clapton, and Ginger Baker elected to have the second disc of this set a live recording (much like The Byrds' \\"Untitled\\"). The Gold edition on DCC exists in TWO versions; a small number were initially manufactured in Japan and while the U.S. editions (manufactured later) have THREE secret bonus tracks that were put there by accident.<br /><br />On disc one we get the original 9 song line up that made up the first disc and Steve Hoffman added \\"Anyone for Tennis\\". There are THREE tracks after that one--alternate mixes of \\"Sitting on Top of the World\\", \\"As You Said\\" and \\"Passing the Time\\". The edition that has the three bonus tracks (that were put there by accident it should be added) is the edition that was manufactured in the U.S.  YOu'll have to inspect the discs to find out of course because unfortunately the outside packaging for the U.S. edition often had the artwork that says Made in Japan.<br /><br />The packaging for the Gold edition is superb--the outside box replicates the silver foil colored cover of the original gatefold sleeve. Inside, the inserts for each disc does likewise. There is also a booklet with session dates, etc. and credits for the album.<br /><br />The sound quality for the gold edition is the best out there and it is definitely worth hunting for!
B000002OTL|5.0|The CD was in perfect condition and arrived in less than a week. And all this at a great price!
B000ZLFALI|1.0|I suspect that lot of the positive reviews are from people whose *parents* weren't even born before the Beatles burst onto the scene in 1964. I see knowing discussions on message boards about the \\"meaning\\" of the songs. I'm convinced that the accessibility of their lyrics corresponded to the quantity of drugs they were taking at any given time. Let's face it, the<br /><br />Beatles were THE GREAT band and Lennon, McCartney and Harrison all wrote some songs that will be remembered for ages. But when their drug use was at its peak, the Beatles' lyrics didn't make a whole lot of sense to the outside world. I'm sure they may have had private meanings to the composers, but that does not make for great popular lyrics. By the time the White Album came out, I really don't think they cared anymore; I'm not sure they were even speaking to each other. That's a pity for us.<br /><br />In the years after they broke up, various frauds and scalawags have had 40 years to manufacture backstories to the songs out of thin air, and kids eat it up as gospel truth.<br /><br />Anyway, this film just exploits the Beatles' music, and the cast's performance of the songs were simply not good enough to eclipse the originals.(I'm thinking especially here of an especially insipid performance of \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand.\\")<br /><br />The Vietnam war is thrown in with the kitchen sink, despite the fact that it wasn't til after the Beatles had broken up that John and Yoko Ono protested the war; the songs the Beatles wrote tended in the main to stay away from social issues (that may have been part of their appeal!)<br />The director also throws in Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin types, when as far as I know their only connection with the Beatles was that they were all featherless bipeds who all lived during the same era.<br /><br />In short, the film is a gaudy and plotless mess that hopes its audience will see flash as substance. Worse, it's an insult to the Beatles' work and to their fans, those who were around when the Beatles were still recording.<br /><br />I have a feeling that the director didn't care about the music,and that she figured younger viewers wouldn't know the difference anyway. Unfortunately, it was a gamble that paid off for her: apparently, the kids DON'T know the difference. That's too bad. The Beatles at their best were light and exuberant pop fun.<br /><br />But when I heard that the central characters were named Lucy and Jude (oh, brother), my heart sank. I knew this was gonna be baaaaaaaaaad with a capital \\"B.\\"<br /><br />In the Thanksgiving scene at Lucy's house, an argument erupts between Lucy's brother Max (yeah, the Silver Hammer guy) and his dad, who wants to know what his slacker son intends to do with his life. Mocking his father, Max imitates him, yelling \\"Do\\"? Do! Do! Do! DO!<br /><br />It would have been more appropriate if he'd stopped after the second \\"do.\\" Because that sums up ATU perfectly: It's do-do.recording.

B000UR366S|5.0|Joni continues to evolve on this masterpiece. The harmonies are complex, her voice is mature and rich in timbre, and the production is stark and almost jarring at times. If you appreciate music, get the album.
1592289444|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. although i have read many other concentration camp books, this one is by far the greatest journey. it really puts you in the perspective of this poor man and when something bad happens to him you seem to feel it for yourself! very descriptive!!                           P.S. whoever said \\"just a story\\" is utterly wrong and has no brain at all!! it is \\"just\\" a gripping story of a man making his way form a concentration camp, all the way down to india. so i do not see how tis can be \\"just a story\\"

1904920209|5.0|Since I use the method of working the dough used in this book every bread I make has improved. The crust is better, the crumb is better and the bread has a better spring in the oven. The DVD is a great learning tool because watching Richard Bertinet makes his method easy to understand and to follow.    The only regret I have is that I did not have Richards Bertinet book/DVD 10 years ago when I started my bread baking hobby.    Richards second book \\"Crust\\" is also fantastic.
B0010V4TZU|5.0|So, why do \\"the haters\\" think that Vampire Weekend is simply a product of music marketing executives? Last I checked, the band is a product of four guys who play instruments and make catchy songs.    They are popular for a reason, and the reason is that they make good songs that aren't too obscurely indie, nor are they too mainstream. It's music that everyone can enjoy and is not directed toward any specific demographic of \\"the indie music world\\".    Take it for what it is - a good album packed with upbeat songs and catchy hooks. Easily puts anyone in a good mood.
B000RJO578|5.0|There really isn't much else to say other then this is funny. If you like british humor, and you liked 'Shaun of the dead', then your sure to love this film.

006135323X|5.0|At it's core, this is a behavior economics book.  But what makes this book different from the host of other behavior economics books out there is that it is (1) very well written and (2) packed with more fascinating studies.  Ariely and his cohorts conduct a number of human behavior studies across a wide range of subjects and he presents them in an easy to read and engaging fashion.  He covers everything from dishonestly (ranging from Fastow et al to students at Harvard Business School), indecision, the role of expectations, and so on.      One of my favorites is his exploration of the role of anchoring.  In other words, how does our first impression of something affect our decisions.  He presents a study in which MIT students are asked to write down the last 2 digits of their SSN on a piece of paper.  They are then asked to bid on a bottle of wine.  Students with high ending SSNs (the top 20%) bid on average $56 for the bottle of wine while students with low ending SSNs (the bottom 20%) bid $16.     Read it.

0307237702|4.0|Barak Obama has a nimble mind and his ideas are refreshing in many ways, but his past does not jive with his present.  I'm from Texas and we have a saying about somebody like Obama..\\"All hat and no Cattle\\"..he goes on and on about looking beyond race etc. and then he belongs to a church, who's leader, his mentor I might add, whose sermon named this book, is a straight up black nationalist racist on par with Farakaan and Huey Charmichael..why on earth would Obama be a member of church that is overwhelmingly black, hardly inclusive with a raving crank as a pastor?  This revealation about the good Rev. has sunk Obama..yes, he will get the Dem. nomination, because blacks are voting 9 to 1 for him and they make up a huge part of the Dem. electorate, but in the national election, they will constitute a little over 10 percent of the vote and the Rep. where smart to nominate a moderate like McCain.  The media has fallen in love with Obama, and thrown poor Hillary under the bus, like Obama threw his poor white grandmother who raised him..now id LOVE to read her book!..anyway, the Dems will get what they deserve, instead of nominating Clinton and winning they nominate a black guy with a racist mentor he refuses to really disavowel, so a slam dunk becomes an airball.  As for this book, it's a good read, Obama has some very good ideas, but many are far to liberal to ever get through Congress and he is hopelessly naive about many things..all and all, I think Barak Obama is an amazing pol. and i envey his confidence in himself, but when I go to vote in November, when I think of voting for Obama I will come back to his church and his mentor/pastor and ask, how does a man who claims to be a uniter of America belong to an all black, black nationalist church, with a racist for a minister for 20 years? I think we all know the unfortunite answer.
B00132D808|2.0|I bought this CD thinking it was going to be hard-charging, amped up and vibrant... I was wrong. Their new CD in fact is \\"pretty odd\\" because it lacks their original momentum and energy. I found nearly 90% the songs on this CD boring and lame - something that I didn't think I would be saying about PATD. The songs have great audio quality and I can feel the whole Beatles/60's inspiration but they should have added their own flair to the genre... and they didn't.<br /><br />Be warned!!! This is not the Panic! at the Disco that we have come to love and get pumped up about. Sadly the new CD will not be making an appearance on my iPod.
0790731940|3.0|This movie holds up over time.   Very entertaining and highly recommend seeing it.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Creating a formula picture is never a good idea - unless you have created a formula like Simong Pegg and Edgar Wright have done here.  Initially, \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" in title and in plot description, sounds like a mere parody of Romero's dead movies ala \\"Scary Movie\\" and such. But Wright and Pegg, in spoofing the genre, create an homage pic.  It's full of funny moments that tip their hit to Romero's 'Zed word' flicks, but it has so much original horror and humor to offer.<br /><br />Namely, the premise is original.  While many horror pics looks at the heroic survivors of a horrific tragedy, \\"Shaun\\" looks at those other guys.  Unlike the inhuman heroism of typical horror pics, Shaun and his friend Ed are unapologetic slackers. In fact, Shaun's desire to save his friends may do more harm than good.  Wright and Pegg craft an interesting bunch of characters that are really those other guys in horror films.  They're funny and horribly flawed.  Shaun's plan to save everyone is interesting in its successes and failures, breaking the trend of so much recent horror.  In all its comedy, you'll still care about every character in the end.  In that, its successful in its own right as a horror film, as much as it is in comedy.<br /><br />But it's the comedy that triumphs above all. The writing is razor sharp.  Listen to every piece of dialogue and you wil realize that Wright and Pegg have crafted an ingenious script that is constantly referencing itself as well as other horror movies.  Key to the writing though is the pitch perfect delivery.  This is something that Simon Pegg, in particular, has perfected.  His humor is rather dry, sometimes subtle.  Yet at the same time, he is also a brilliant physical comedian, as noted in this film's famous jukebox scene.<br /><br />Pegg doesn't ride alone in his talent though.  He has quite a bit of support, namely in his partner in crime Nick Frost - who's humor is much more direct as the lovable oaf Ed, and Dylan Moran, who has achieved fame in his own right doing stand up and in Black Books.  While visibly more sober here, Moran is impecable as the uptight critical friend of Shaun's girlfriend.<br /><br />But one sole review is not enough to express all the great things about 'Shaun of the Dead.'  You're best served by watching the film.  When you're done watch it again.  If you have time, watch it again and just listen to it to hear all the witty dialogue.  Then you can raid the extras.  This DVD is full of them.  While I love \\"plot holes\\" section, my favorite involves the making of the film.  This is far from standard 'making of' fare, as it traces \\"Shaun\\" from it's young origins.  Watch these guys at work - you'll realize more goes into this comedy than a simple script and a couple funny actors.<br /><br />Just as a side note, for those curious, the Region 2 DVD differs in the fact that the UK trailers are included and that 3 (coun them: 3!) more commentaries are included.

0739366408|4.0|WORLD WAR Z es uno de mis libros favoritos, pues ha sabido unir lo autenticamente terrorifico con lo mas aun terrorifica partes oscuras de la propia naturaleza humana. La amenaza de los zombies sumada a los magnos errores humanos y terribles desiciones que se tomaron como solucion al problema, hace de esta cronica de la Guerra Z algo como escapado de la vida real. \\"Puede ocurrir, me lo creo\\", es lo uno piensa mientras lee este gran libro.Lastima que siga inedito en español. En cuanto al audiobook de WORLD WAR Z, es notable la preocupacion de los editores y el propio autor para reforzar ese aire de veracidad que de por si ya tiene el relato, y que aprovecan de formato de entrevistas del libro original, para hacer que el audiobook dramatice tales entrevistas, sirviendose de actores comocidos - tal vez si hubiesen sido anonimos, hubiese mas \\"veracidad\\" a lo narrado- que hacen muy bien su trabajo. Max Brook- el autor- hace de entrevistador en todos los segmentos, y lo hace muy convincemente. Todo bien. Me hubiese gustado mas efectos de sonido. Pero en general,estoy muy satisfecho on la compra.Otra vez, lastima que tampoco haya una version en español de este audiolibro. 5 cds que te llevaran a la etapa mas oscura que pudiese atravezar la humanidad. este material pide a gritos que lo lleven a ser una miniserie de HBO, tipo \\"Band of Brothers\\".Un total exito cantado.

1401207529|5.0|BATMAN YEAR ONE es un comic pionero en muchos aspectos.Desde un Frank Miller con una tematica mas cercana a su rompedor DAREDEVIL de Marvel que a su archiconocido BATMAN THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, vemos a un Bruce Wayne en los inicios de su carrera de justiciero, y la justificacion psicologica de ello - la violenta muerte de sus padres. En una personalidad menos compleja que la de Bruce, este horrendo hecho hubiese quedado en una serie interminable de visitas a algun psicoanalista, pero en él fue el desencadenante de un afan no tanto justiciero como de venganza, sino de poner control al caos que se llevó a sus padres y amenaza tragarse completa a Gotham City.Esto lo entendió a la perfeccion Miller y nos da una poderosa fabula de iniciacion del Murciélago que nos lleva de tour a la mente de este peculiar personaje, que si bien no tiene motivaciones lógicas que digamos, si crea un inmediato vinculo empatico con el lector de cualquier gusto o genero de lectura. Este es el merito de este comic, que es para todos y pide mas de una lectura para entender su profundidad, a pesar de los superficial que pudiese parecer a simple vista el tema. No se dejen engañar, este comic es oro puro, y si ya lo leiste, releelo; y sino lo tienes, pues que envidia el poder leerlo por primera vez.

B0001KZM3O|4.0|Many people argue that this record should just be considered a Waters solo album with the other band members being session musicians. Could we not argue the same thing for a Momentary Lapse with David Gilmour being the lead player? I find the The Final Cut to be a superior album to a Momentary Lapse of Reason and is also one of the best Floyd records, sound-quality wise. The music is extremely dark and melancholy. Perhaps darker than the previous albums, but do we really expect light-hearted material from Pink Floyd's concept albums? The album does not go without its flaws. I do agree that Waters was too ambitious. He thought for those years that he was the epitome of the band. Songs like \\"Get your filthy hands off my desert\\" and \\"Your Possible Pasts\\" are proof of this and also the albums quiet nature(except, \\"Not Now, John\\"). These shortcomings are balanced with amazing tracks like The Gunner's Dream, Two Suns in the Sunset and The Final Cut(which I think is the best track). It may not be as good as the Wall or Wish You Were Here, but it is truly their last great album. People like to crticize Waters for being as ambitious as he is, but after creating the concepts behind Dark Side and the Wall, it is understandable that he would want to have more control to create the music that he wants. If you decide to listen to this album, try your utmost to be as objective as possible and think of it as Pink Floyd, not Roger Waters.

B00004TDTO|4.0|I have all the Jaws movies. Exciting movie to watch and my kind of movies. I also love the background music as that  also helps add to the excitement of the movie. It also prepares people for when they go into the oceans to swim.  Thank heavens I can't swim.  I'd most likely be the one to be attacked by a shark. The acting was very good and the scenery too. The mayor in my opinion, although he was suppose to be on the negative side to make money for the town, was very dislike by me. He had the kind of face profile that even turned me off, although he may be a very nice person. Once scene that I had a problem with was where the great white jumped onto the boat and the guy slid into his mouth.  Hard to believe something like that would or could happen.

B000002GYR|4.0|I was about 20 years old laying on my parents couch watching the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Mom was to my right drunk and babbeling about some obscure moment in her life that no one within the sphere of sanity would care about. Then, all of a sudden Jay Leno announces what my than 20 year old mind framed as \\" some old guy playing the piano.\\" His voice resembled that of an elderly man who just drank a bottle of drano. Yet remarkably, I felt that he was incredible. I immediately went out and bought \\"Closing Time\\" by Tom Waits and I have NO regrets.<br /><br /> Have you ever purchased a CD that you felt just didn't have a bad song on it? They are definately far and few between. Closing Time is one of those CD's. Not a bad song in the bunch. Though I have to say my personal favorites are \\"ol 55\\" and \\"Old Shoes.\\" Tom's voice is clearer in tone, so I'm thinkin his drano drinking days were yet still ahead of him. As a lover of music and musicianship (and just over all good song writing) this is a must own in this reviewers humble opinion. Tom doesn't live in my CD player (MP3 player now that I finally purchased one_) as much as some of my favorite Jazz artists, but he still frequents my listening pleasure from time to time. If you have never heard this CD you should give it a spin or two.<br /><br />Botton Line: This is music you should listen to and you will enjoy.

B0013ISU0A|2.0|This is the first Limited Edtion that includes a DVD but does not make it the best intro.  The video directed by Vincent Moon is so annoying, especially the beginning part where the camera shakes all over the place.  It appears to be some sort of avant garde CRAP or some excercise in making something so different so horrible.  In addition all of the video is in black and white.  Why?  I don't know, it does nothing to help the already bad video direction.  And lastly the video is very short.  REM plays only a handful of songs from the new album.<br /><br />There are better REM limited edtions, look for them here at bargain basement prices.  A very upsetting release for me personally.

B000Q66PXE|4.0|The ingredients do not necessarily suggest a successful TV-series. There's extreme, relentless, at times mind numbing violence, graphically depicted; barely a single sympathetic character is in sight; there is not the slightest hint of anything humoristic (well, except for Ian McNeices delicious newsreader); and as always actual historical fact is twisted and turned into something that may be suitable for entertainment purposes but rather (over)stretches credulity at times - one wonders why, because it's not as if these people actually were a dull bunch leading uneventful lives. Yet \\"Rome\\" is strangely haunting and compelling. Often it does a good job of transporting the viewer to a world unencumbered by Christian sensitivities, particularly in its love of bloodsports, its dealings with slaves, and its relaxed attitude to sex and public nudity. Full frontal male nudity is not eschewed, still the final frontier in film-making. Also, and more importantly, \\"Rome\\" conveys the constant sense of tension, intrigue and threat dominating the lives of those in power. Finally, a fairly good job was done of giving a realistic impression of the city itself in those final decades before the birth of Christ. It is, however, weird and rather silly that the characters speak English but throw in occasional Latin. The perfect, smudge-free make-up and excellent teeth also make you wonder (Suetonius describes Octavian's teeth as \\"few, small and decayed\\").<br />Typically, many of the main dramatic historical events are not shown, but only told in flashback. For instance, we do not witness Mark Antony's finest hour, his eulogy at Caesar's funeral, that swayed Roman public opinion against the assassins. Several decisive battles, including that of Actium, are also conveniently skipped.<br /><br />The story is told from the vantage point of two soldiers, one eventually rising through the ranks, the other only finding a settled existence towards the end. Both are, though in name only, based on historical characters. Gruff and dutiful Lucius Vorenus is haunted by personal tragedy. He struggles with his role as a father and his allegiance to a loosing party, that of Mark Antony; struggles that at one point will land him as the leader of a band of hired assassins. His unlikely friend Titus Pullo leads an aimless existence that never manages to be carefree and that only gains some focus whenever some fighting is to be done. The plot has been constructed around the far-out premise that the whole birth of the Roman Empire pivoted on the actions of these two men, rather than those of Julius Caesar and his ilk. The idea has been woven into the story so tightly and cleverly that it is surprisingly easy to suspend disbelief.<br /><br />The first season is the more consistent and compelling of the two, dealing with the battle between Julius Caesar and Magnus Pompey. The strife between the families of Caesar and Brutus is exemplified by their two matrons Atia and Servilia, both in their way as vicious and devious a schemer as you're ever likely to see. The development of the relationship between Vorenus and Niobe is believable and quite touching.<br />The second season then depicts the power struggle between Mark Antony and Gaius Octavian, and introduces the exotic element of Egypt, where Cleopatra's court appears to be some kind of whorehouse and the Queen herself a scantily dressed upmarket prostitute. Halfway through this season the story start to get ragged, and some plotlines hang by a precariously thin thread (the way Vorenus discovers his daughter's betrayal is like something out of an uninspired Miss Marple episode). A Jewish subplot is randomly tacked on and feels like a cumbersome invention to burden the story with irrelevant premonitions of Christ. Furthermore, it doesn't help that a substantial number of  the more interesting characters, notably Cicero, Servilia and Brutus, are killed off. The \\"Xena, Warrior Princess\\"- act of Gaia in the battle of the Collegia is probably the low point of the series. Fortunately, things are pulled together for the final episodes, where the story is satisfyingly wrapped up and the viewer is indeed left, in Octavian's words, with the sense of having travelled a long road.<br /><br />History buffs will find ample cause to be annoyed nonetheless. Many events are fabricated, characters are missing (where are Octavia's husband Claudius Marcellus, Atia's husband Lucius Phillippus and Marc Anthony's wife Fulvia?), people weren't really in the places where we see them at the moment we see them there (Caesar wasn't killed in the Senate, Cicero wasn't killed at home), and several details of costume and ritual are anachronistic or invented. Alexandria is shown as some rustic backwater rather than the dazzling metropolis it was.<br />Characters are sometimes almost insultingly distorted. Cicero wasn't the abject hypocrite and coward he's been made into by the makers of the series. He delivered the Philippics against Antony himself, and was a figure of great power and huge popularity. Atia gets even worse treatment: described by Tacitus as one of the most admired and devout matrons of Rome, who couldn't bear crude language and was deeply serious, she is turned into a foul-mouthed, violent she-devil.<br />Generally speaking it is a pity that most of the characters are rather flat and stereotyped. It sometime makes it hard to believe when they do change, as when the cynical libertine Mark Antony suddenly waxes philosophical after loosing the battle of Actium. Easily the most complex, fascinating and moving character in the series is that of Brutus, played with consummate skill and total conviction by Tobias Menzies. It is a great pity that the scriptwriters did not retain for him his dignified suicidal death, but instead have him madly confront an entire legion on his own, and die a death mirroring that of Caesar - the symbolism is very trite.<br />Such concerns may seem academic, but in this TV-dominated age its only too likely that many will think that after watching \\"Rome\\" they actually know something of Roman history. Not so - but they will have been splendidly entertained.low point of the series.

B000W4HFY8|5.0|Angelo Badalamenti's moody sound canvas transports us once again to the town of Twin Peaks, and surrounds us with those beloved - if slightly crazy - characters.  Immediately conjuring up images that were so specific to the series (I still harbor resentment toward ABC nearly 2 decades later for killing this show after their initial overkill promotion) it makes me \\"pine\\" for the days when we could tune in weekly for our fix of unique kitsch... The owls ARE what they seem on this great CD.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|I was really amazed when I red about the idea of sharing their music through the internet. That's so fresh and cool it got to be something coming from Radiohead.

B0010X73ZG|5.0|Where would you rather be? In the store filled with a bunch of crazy people who are about to sacrifice you for their religious beliefs or outside taking your chances with the creatures of the mist? I think we should ask ourselves who the real monsters are.     Theres seems to be a lot of debate over the display of humanity and religion in the movie. I think Darabont intended to represent Mrs. Carmody not as what a strong Christian would be like during tense situations but as someone who uses religion as the reason for what they are doing whether it is good or bad, wrong or right. I believe when someone brings religion into a situation, they intend for it to do good, but it can and most times come off as being something people would say is wrong(especially sacrificing someone). The relation was displayed good in the movie.    As far as the movie as a whole goes, it was pretty good. The acting was alright but could have used some work. I thought the creatures looked good and I was interested in the whole military operation part of it. I wish there could have been more said about that. As for the ending, I dont know, I thought it was almost perfect up to like the last minute but it will have to do.

B000001GK9|5.0|Music flowed from Gustav's pen. Close affinity into Alma's psyche characterized the treatment of his heroine in this recording.     Here we can feel how much composer and conductor are generous and noble, with poetic vision, depth and richness of feelings. Karajan's conducting is profuse like telling us the theatrical incidents with elaborations into the ideas. Karajan's interpretation has a curious mixture of a most penetrating insight into Mahler's dramatic values  We can appreciate the spirit of Music (and only music) that prevails in Mahler/Karajan association.  Music is beyond cavil, it overrules trivial arguments which now look anachronous, and misdated.  Music has nothing to do with past ideological applications that have been the chief failing of outstanding genius - Mahler.  Looking back on this chapter, however fierce the quarrels with the composer on strong and silly ideological limitations, I presume that if Mahler had lived to hear his music under Karajan's magic, he would have angered by the agony that, during his time,  art and ideology failed to come to terms with each other.

B0013FXWU6|4.0|I'm not going to talk about the movie itself because there are already plenty of reviews about it. Instead I'll write about the product itself. The single disc is going to be released in a shabby, extremely thin cardboard slip. Think of something along the lines of a sideways matchbook. When I saw it I thought it was one of those preview discs for the movie that stores sometimes give away if you buy something related to the product. But no it was the actual retail version. So if you're particular about the way your DVDs appear then you've been warned. However, there is the alternative two-disc copy that has a more standard look. It's also cardboard but it's not so cheap looking. It's similar to the Apocalypse Now: The Complete Dossier box.

0312379293|5.0|The mystery and unsuspecting twists draw the reader into the book from cover to cover.  Murders, courtroom drama, life behind the doors of prison life, injustice, redemption, and a clever love story on several levels are all ingredients that give this Archer offering my vote for five stars. Falsely accused of a murder, Danny must prove his innocence by trapping the real killers through an clever plan that is seemingly uncovered by authorities who outwit themselves in the process.   The characters are interesting and well developed evoking the readers emotions and making this a page turner.  This story is smart with an intelligent and stealthily plotted story and and series of wrenching twists that keep the reader guessing who will finally prevail in the end.  The setting in Scotland and Great Britan add a foreign flavor that is a respite from the formula books of so many American murder mystery authors.  You won't want to put it down.
B0002W4SWC|5.0|Renee Zellweger does a fabulous job of portraying Bridget Jones.  You would never guess that this great accent came from a Texan.  At the age of 32, she is unhappy with her unmarried status, and everyone constantly throws it in her face.  She is interested in her boss Daniel Cleaver, but knows he is not the type of man that she should see.  When she meets Mark Darcy (a set up by her mother), they dislike each other immediately, and the fact he hates Daniel is just a bonus.  The comedy that follows is just hilarious.    This is a very entertaining movie.  Hugh Grant sheds his normal good guy persona to be the guy you love to hate.  He is very effective in the role switch.  Colin Firth is just plain loveable.  This is a movie to pull out and watch again and again.
B0013FBS20|4.0|Will Smith puts in a brilliant performance as the last \\"normal\\" man in a New York ravaged by a disease that has turned most people into feral night-hunting predators (not literally vampires as in Matheson's classic novel). The theatrical version of the film is greatly marred by a jarringly trite Hollywood-style ending that is completely out of step with the rest of the film. Fortunately, the Blu-Ray disk includes an Alternative version with a far superior ending  (and one that is considerably more faithful to the spirit of Matheson's novel). Because the alternative ending builds on plot elements from earlier in the film, I can only imagine that it was the original ending, but that somebody lost their nerve.
B0010X745K|2.0|{MINOR SPOILERS} Sounded good up front; the mysterious mist was a good idea.  Unfortunately, that was where the originality ended and the cliche's began.  This movie was so dumb that I don't think I'll even be able to right an intelligent sounding review about it, so bear with me.  Btw, I gave it two stars because it's a decent kids movie....for the ones old enough to see some gore.<br /><br />I suppose I watched about the 1st half hour, just enough to see the first monster, and then then dumb factor went off the scale.  After that, I had no choice but to skim through the rest of it, stopping at the various  monster scenes to see if any of the stupidity had cleared up.<br /><br />For example, how many more ridiculous scenes must we be subjected to where one person gets attacked and ten others stand around with their mouths open?  Somehow, in some bizarre way, this is still considered good writing and good acting, but not in my book.<br /><br />And how stupid to they think the audience is, putting characters in that belong in a mental ward.  For example, when the mist first gets to the store, they hear one man screaming, and another comes running in with a bloody face, saying that 'something took him'.<br /><br />This immediately tells the characters what will happen if they venture into the mist.<br /><br />But then, for the first monster scene, we are treated to 3 redneck morons who are ready to open the door and go outside as if the mist is all silliness.  But then if the mist is just silliness, what is everybody hiding in the store for?<br /><br />This is a kids movie, with 'big scary monsters', and I have no doubt I would have loved this when I was ten or 12.  But at 34, I'm looking for at least a thin slice of reality in the movies I watch.<br /><br />The characters were dumb......literally idiots.  When you have an unbelievable monster movie, you have to make some other part believable so the audience can relate in some small way........that assumes the audience cares of course, and apparently many don't.<br /><br />May as well call this one a cash cow.  Combine top quality CGI monsters with the usual batch of cliches, and if you get lucky, you'll land a big paycheck.  Zero originality or believability required.as well call this one a cash cow.

It's amazing that none of the music has gone out of date. I like having all of the extra tracks that weren't released previously. Many of the best musicians of that era performed at the concert.
B00008438V|4.0|I've seen this movie time and time again over the years.  Quotable, comedic brilliance.  This is one of Hughes' classics and to be honest, I'm more of a fan of this flick than [[ASIN:B0000A98ZP The Breakfast Club (High School Reunion Collection)]] (which as we all know is argued as the best of the 'Brat Pack' collection).    It's safe to say that any guy who has used a computer after seeing this movie has wanted their own Lisa, I know I still do.    Highly recommended for a rainy weekend with a few beers.
0765318741|3.0|I made the mistake of seeing the movie first.  I was warned that the book was different, and as far as I am concerned, they could have been completely unrelated.  As a Stephen King lover, it's fair to say that horror is probably my favorite genre where fiction is concerned.  Having said that, short horror stories don't usually do it for me.  I like details, and in that respect, I felt this book was lacking.  Neville started projects and left them unfinished, how the \\"infected\\" evolved or what it meant to be living or undead was never really explained, and there were several other things that left me thinking.  I don't mind a book that makes me think, but answer SOME questions, for crying out loud.  All in all, not a complete disappointment.  It was good for 2 nights' reading, and I think had I not seen the movie first, it might have ranked 4 stars.  Bottom line: For me, the movie was FAR better...  Or maybe I just missed something.

After all that, the blacks still believe there's nothing in the Mist and decide  to march out and look for help? Yeah, right.     Then, after a white guy gets burned pretty bad, the whites get brave, and march out  to gather medical supplies for him. I know anyone of any race can die, but all the blacks? :) One soldier hangs himself, the MP gets filled with spider eggs.     I'll say it was a scary, entertaining, thought-provoking film..For a one-time rental.
B0010ZR160|4.0|Working for the first time on the opposite side of the camera, actor-turned-director Ben Affleck has delivered a solid, if imperfect, crime drama entitled \\"Gone Baby Gone,\\" based on the novel by Dennis Luhane.  Ben's brother, Casey, and Michelle Monaghan play a pair of missing-persons investigators hired to find a little girl who disappeared from her Boston home three days earlier.  Her mother is a foul-mouthed coke-fiend who is not very particular about the company she keeps and who seems strangely reluctant to cooperate with the authorities working to get her daughter back.  Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris co-star as cops whose involvement with the case grows ever more complicated as the drama unfolds.<br /><br />Affleck co-wrote the screenplay - his first since 1997`s \\"Good Will Hunting\\" - with Aaron Stockard, and together they have gone beyond the surface simplicities of the standard whodunit to probe the ethical complexities that are, for good or for ill, an integral part of law enforcement work.  As the central character, Patrick is continually confronted with the moral relativism of his actions, be it in negotiating with child abductors without police authority, shooting down an unarmed pedophile who has just murdered a child, or going after a crooked cop who reveals a legal indiscretion to him in a moment of drunken confidence.  Yet, when all the murky details of the case are finally revealed, Patrick realizes that, when it comes to doing what's \\"right,\\" even he has a line over which he will not cross - even if, by refusing to do so, he loses the one thing that matters the most to him in his life.  And yet there's still no guarantee that the choice he makes will be the best for all concerned in the end.

B000F4LPJ6|5.0|I actually got a bootleg version of this movie on ebay and am now just buying it from Amazon. What the amazon info gives you is most of the story of the movie but when you finally see it you will come to understand why it is such a cult icon movie both and Japan and the United States. As you see the movie you feel that the director actually got how a real-life person would react in this situation could you kill you're best friend or another person you knew to survive.The acting from all the people I felt was great and they brought out the emotion you felt that character would have in that situation.The killings though bloody aren't any worse than what you see in any PG17 or R-rated movie there are suggested sex scenarios(What I mean by that is you see in one scene a pool with a few boys in the nude dead and the girl who killed them dressing up and leaving.) For the price of this movie I say it's worth it but again just to specify this is definitely not a family viewing movie
B0010V4TZU|5.0|Wow. I haven't felt this way since the heyday of the Talking Heads! Am I ancient? Maybe. But I also listen to a lot of music -- old & new -- and these guys ROCK!     (Kudos to Rostam!)
0375424474|5.0|A great read - thoroughly entertaining and packed full of interesting information and observations from a life of fossil digging. Great first step on the path to science for the Creationist crowd.
B000AP04OM|5.0|Great music, great scenery, great story.  Positive and ultra-uplifting.  One of the best movies I've ever seen.  The remastered quality is fantastic.
B0011HOEY4|5.0|The movie was a thrilling 2 and a half hours of anticipation and excitment. It gives you a real look into the lifes' of people destroyed by drugs and who makes the profit off it. It shows really how money does control people no matter what, not loyality to your family, friends or even your country.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|OK, I'm a European mother, but finally here's a CD I can listen to with my kids!  I think this is the best CD I have heard so far from LP, finally some message is back into rock and roll.  WHAT'S WRONG ABOUT THAT, by the way?  That's at the root of rock and roll.  And each song has its own distinctive sound.  I appreciate the diversity.
B000002LMM|5.0|Great music from the classic show. If you are a TP fan and don't have this then shame on you.
B00009EIQE|1.0|First of all, let it be said that Buddy Guy is an electric Blues guitarist, and not a pre-War \\"Country Blues\\" artist. His guitar playing on the Skip James track really shows that Buddy was simply clowning around at these sessions and is also very limited on an acoustic guitar. The subtleties and nuances that Skip James provided us with in the song, on both the 1931 recording and on later versions, is totally missing from the Buddy Guy version. Johnny Shines, who is one of the greatest Bluesmen of the second half of the 20th century, has a song on this album that is covered by Buddy Guy, according to the liner notes from this album. The only problem is that the Buddy Guy track doesn't resemble the Shines version in any way. The music and lyrics are totally different. Every song on this album lacks the vitality and musical sophistication of the respective originals. People who claim to be Blues fans and rank this album very high are obviously doing so only because they are huge Buddy Guy fans. I enjoy Buddy Guy's Chess recordings and also some of the stuff he did during his comeback almost 20 years ago, but this album is just plain awful. If you want to hear some good acoustic Blues music, I strongly recommend Johnny Shines' \\"Standing at the Crossroads\\", \\"The Complete Recordings of Robert Johnson\\" or Furry Lewis' \\"Shake 'Em On Down\\". Those recordings are three of the best examples of excellent Blues music.

B0013D8LOK|5.0|Johnny Depp has definitely come a long way from having nightmares of the razorblade gloved one on Elm st. Depp now get's to be the one responsible for all the bloodshed as the razorblade weilding psycho barber Sweeney Todd in Tim Burtons masterful movie/musical \\"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street\\". While bringing this delightfully creepy musical to screen Burton brings along with him those very same delightfully quirky and colorfully dark undertones that are riddled throughout all of his prior films and inturn creates yet another instant classic. To me this film is straight up flawless! The music is beautifully dark and witty and Everyone involved in this film did a brilliant job especially actress Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs Lovett, but Johnny Depp without a doubt steals the show and slices his way through the screen. If anyone had any doubts about Depps vocal range or ability to carry a tune, by the end of the first verse of the openning song those doubts were no more. If you still doubt his singing ability after watching this film... your delusional. This is a bloody & fun thriller, superbly acted with a perfect pace and breathtaking atmosphere. On there sixth film together Tim Burton and Johnny Depp have again created something brilliant here.

B0000VCZK2|5.0|I had been looking at this set for a while but didn't want to spend 60.00 to 70.00 $ for it. I found it on Amazon for half that and it was well worth the money. So many extra features on the history of these movies and how some of the effects were done. I had forgotten how good \\"Alien\\" was, not having seen it for a few years, and it was ever better than I remembered. If you look for this at Best Buy, Target or even Walmart, you'll spend at least 60.00$.  The accordion type case holding the DVDs  is a little difficult to handle because there are so many disks, but that's about the only drawback to the set.  You won't be sorry if you buy this.  Terrific collection.

B00005JLR2|5.0|I'm generally wary when Hollywood makes movies of any book, especially a classic, and so I was a little worried about \\"Treasure Planet,\\" and yet it turned out to be one of my all-time favorite Disney movies! I can't figure out why it wasn't as big a hit as Disney hoped, because a movie like this definitely deserves it. It's a great family film full of adventure, and I just love the idea of setting \\"Treasure Island\\" in space! Who could have come up with such a fun idea but Disney? Silver is even a cyborg! How perfect! Voices, special effects, everything seemed to be spot-on, including the music (which also included a specially-written son by The Goo Goo Dolls just for this movie). I fell in love with \\"Treasure Planet\\" the first time I saw it and watch it all the time!
0810994739|5.0|My son is 11 years old & really does not like to read for pleasure.  He'll read exactly the bare minimum for school work & it's a super chore to get him to read in the summer.  He devoured this book in just one afternoon.  Plus, he has re-read the book a number of times.  I highly reccomend it!
0452287588|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK....It is challenging me to grow up spiritually. I also find it helpful in understanding the Bible better.  I think that there have been many enlightened people throughout history. Jesus was one of them and the main one IMHO.  I am a christian and I find this book is opening doors for me mentally and spiritually. I recommend this book if like Neo in the Matrix , you feel that there is more to life than you have been told, and you feel the need to be awakened!  Thumbs up!
B000WTZ784|4.0|I listen to this album and actually feel sorry for Tony Banks and Michael Rutherford. This disc carries with it the weight of the history of Genesis. Ant, Peter, Steve, Phil - all were gone at this point, but their shadows remained. Frankly, this is the album's greatest problem. The best thing that happened to \\"And Then There were Three\\" was that the band had a chance to find it's legs - whch led to \\"Duke\\". Peter Gabriel's departure had resulted in \\"A Trick of the Tail\\". No such luck this time. Ray Wilson suffered for sounding like Peter Gabriel (I also hear Greg Lake.). Yes, I'm aware that lies at the feet of Mike & Tony, but it is what it is. The was potential here. I think this band would have done OK, perhaps even well, if not for the storied history it carried on it's back.    Favorite tracks: Congo, The Dividing Line, Uncertain Weather, There must be some other way, If that's what You Need (I'm a romantic at heart.), One Man's Fool.    Lousy track: Small Talk.    Why Four Stars? Listen, and hear what might have been.

Although Dexter is a serial killer he possesses a code of ethics. He only kills bad people. Watch it for yourself you won't be disappointed.
1878424505|5.0|The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz is awesome! I actually read the sequel \\"The Mastery of Love\\" first and loved that book, so it's no surprise that \\"The Four Agreements\\" made just as deep an impression on me as it did.    Ruiz's agreements are a small but incredibly useful set of \\"rules-to-live-by\\" that when used can revolutionize one's life! For example, the act of just being impeccable with my word made such a big difference for me. I told someone I would go to an event but felt  like giving an excuse and not going. However, my better side won out and I stayed the course, kept my word and had the most marvelous time! Also, a few things neatly resolved themselves while I was away. If I hadn't left the house, I would have just sat at home and sulked about the situation. The universe does indeed provide!    Other authors I highly recommend are Ariel & Shya Kane who have written [[ASIN:1888043180 Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment]], and [[ASIN:1888043040 Working on Yourself Doesn't Work: A Book About Instantaneous Transformation]]. The Kanes also have a few simple principles that when applied can shift your life dramatically. Their books belong on every spiritual seekers' bookshelf!

B0012K1ILW|1.0|After much hype about this CD, I was unimpressed. Most of the songs have a very odd musical arrangement causing the lyrics to seem disjointed and contrived. I like one song --Honey. The rest are awful. I would not recommend buying this CD. I'm sorry I did!
B000VWE5OY|5.0|I cannot describe how amazing this television series is and I cannot wait for season 2 to be released in the US. Especially since I am in one of the only areas in the country that does not get BBC America through Cablevision!<br /><br />Brilliant acting, writing, special FX, brilliant everything! If you enjoy the new episodes of Dr. Who, you will  probably like this show. This show ties into its spin off show (Dr. Who) but it does not require the viewer to have watched Dr. Who at all although there are references to Torchwood in Dr. Who and visa versa.<br /><br />It's just great. I highly recommend this. There isn't an actor who could play Captain Jack any better than John Barrowman. He's not only sexy, he is an incredible actor. Eve Myles and Burn Gorman are also amazing as is the entire cast including guest actors. My favorite character, Owen played by Burn Gorman, adds a great depth to the series that is not seen in too many modern television shows.<br /><br />This is the type of series that you cannot tear yourself away from because the story lines just suck you right into the action. The first scene of episode one will get you hooked. A mechanical glove that can bring you back to life for a minute, come on now! It's brilliant!!!!! The last DVD has all of the commentary from each episode which gives you some chance to meet the actors, the creator of the show (Russell T. Davies), directors and writers and hear a little bit more about the inner workings of each episode.<br /><br />I only wish that BBC would come out with the Blu-Ray version of this and Dr. Who. That would be icing on the cake!!!
0385338724|4.0|This book was cute, but not quite as satisfying as other Kinsella books.  There were not a lot of laugh out loud moments, but overall a cute story.
0307277887|5.0|I have been a fan of the Showtime series Dexter since it's release.  I've seen each episode a hand full of times and since September 30th (the premier of season 3) is a long ways away I decided to read the books.<br /><br />Darkly Dreaming Dexter is the first of the 'Dexter' novels and while there are a number of parallels between the book and the series, the book brings a certain level of character detail that the show surprisingly missed.  More over, a number of the events that take place in the book greatly differ from that of the show making it almost more interesting to somebody who has seen the series.<br /><br />If you have not seen the television series then this book is perfect for anybody with a bit of a cynical side and a passion for a dark thriller.<br /><br />In short: I highly recommend this title, its a great read for anyone who has or has not seen the series.  I've got the second book on the way and I'll be back with a review of that when I am done!<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />- Nicholas

B000001FTD|3.0|Anthrax has to be one of the most overrated thrash bands to come out the '80s and this ablum is a prime example.    Charlie Benante is probably the best musician in the band but I can't say much for the rest.  Scott Ian and Dan Spitz have good main riffs but there is no skill whatsoever in lead guitars.  Anthrax's solos just suck, period! Joey Belladonna is OK but his whinning voice just gets irritating after a while.    In terms of lyrics, this album shows a talent of close to zero.  In \\"Indians\\" Belladonna sings 'Cry for the Indian!'; please!  Cry for the Indian?  This is thrash!  You don't sing about crying for anything unless it's about some pioneer woman crying for mercy as she's getting raped and scalped by a pissed off Comanche.  A sad excuse for an Indian Apology song compared to Maiden's 'Run to the Hills' and that's not even thrash metal.  If I'd want to hear a song asking me to cry about something I'd be a Bon Jovi fan instead!  \\"Efilnikcufecin.\\"  Wow!  You can recite nice f***in life backwards: creative backward messages there dude!  If I want to know more about Belushi's life I'll just watch 'Animal House' as that sums it up quite well and is a lot more entertaining than this song. \\"Caught In A Mosh.\\"  I can see the creative flow for this song, \\"Dude! Let's write a mosh song about a mosh and call it 'Caught in a Mosh'!\\"  Wow, there's genius talent for you!  For mosh songs I prefer more creative stuff like Pantera's 'Death Rattle' from Reinventing the Steel or just Slayer's 'Angel of Death' will do.  \\"I Am The Law.\\"  Oh please not a comic book character song!  It's about as exciting as the original Batman TV title song and about as bad as the Dredd movie that followed with Sly.  The album came out when I was a teen and I thought this song was infantile even then!  'Skeletons in the Closet' is probably the best song on this album.    Anyway, Anthrax had a good start with Spreading the Disease but just became one of the most overrated thrash bands in history and this ablum is proof.  Good riffs; decent vocals and drums; dum lyrics; and, simply lousy solo work.  Makes me think of a decent garage band you invite for a summer block party with beer kegs.  After a few beers the music starts sounding really great for a mosh with friends but that's about it.
B000X418UE|5.0|This is one to see.  The cast of characters is impressive and each role is intertwined toward the climax of the movie.  The directing is excellent and the movie moves at a near perfect pace.  There is no need for a \\"Director's Cut\\" for this one because the plot is well defined, set-up and executed very well.  Add this one to your collection and you will watch it over and over.
B000001FDQ|4.0|Despite the negative reviews which have some merit, I still think this album in particular is great because of its originality in terms of composition.    Yngwie's music does have its drawbacks and may not be for everyone.  I think you have to essentially like classical guitar/music to like this album.  Yngwie has great techniques founded on classical guitar and violin but that doesn't make a rock 'n' roll album for a variety of reasons.  First of all, heavy metal or hard rock is primarily rock 'n' roll which means blues.  Although classical guitar and classical music often has a strong influence in metal it's not rock 'n' roll.  Secondly, apart from Jimmy Hendrix, I can't think of many rock bands where the lead guitarist is the entire band.  That wasn't even the case for Van Halen when David Lee Roth left the band.  It's ironic that Malmsteen idolizes Pagannini so much because he shares the same flaws.  Pagannini was a great violinist but not a good composer and that's why he left the composition of his concertos to someone else: Malmsteen should have done the same with his works and let other musicians bring their talent.  DeSoto never wanted to be a metal singer and was looking for a gig as a power rock singer to the likes of Survivor: it sounds like it.  I had the unique opportunity of seeing Malmsteen perform on his own.  Great soloist without question but having a band is just that: being a band and not just a soloist.  That's why Satriani, McAlpine, etc., never made it anywhere either.  I also saw Malmsteen perform as a stand in with Dio in Irvine and he sounded great.  He would have been a perfect replacement for Vivian Campbell.  It would have made for an interesting collaboration but I don't think the egos of either performer would have gotten along: too bad.    Ultimately, the main impediment to Yngwie's success was his overwhelming ego at wanting to be the whole band and trying to turn metal into classical.  And so, true to his Swedish pseudonym of 'Yngwie', he ended up remaining just that: just a 'little viking.'
0452287588|5.0|A much easier read than his previous The Power of Now.  Absolutely fabulous for anyone even beginning their spiritual journey to simply be.  I recommend it to all who are open minded and want to really understand themselves and the world around us  This book brings a sense of peace and understanding.  Like most great books on topics such as this, it really warrants several readings and referrals.  It is a great book to simply pick up after having read it and open it to any page and refresh your understanding.

0143038419|1.0|I started to read it last summer due to a book group choice. Couldn't pass the italian chapter. What a bratt!!! I just couldn't stand her selfpittying and \\"I am so Pretty, oh so pretty\\" approach. I started to want to write to her husband and tell him how  much of a great guy he was, even if I didn't know anything about him.  Well, the reason why I am writting this is because I found an incredible book to read, especially by EVERYONE who tried to read EAT PRAY...    I just finished the Glass Castle,so I understand why women in search of evasion would read EAT PRAy... But if you truly want to cherish your life and see how fortunate you are, just read the Glass Castle. Complete opposite. It will make you ashame of self pittying (is that a word?).  If you still want to dream or escape, you are better off watching the cooking channel or Discovery or Travel....   I am stunned EAT PRAY... is a best seller. She doesn't deserve it!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|One show got us hooked! If you have the stomach for it, this is one of the best shows to watch. The character development and story lines are written wonderfully. It is a pleasure to be entertained by good writing and fantastic acting. I liked Michael C. Hall in Six Feet Under, but I think his performance as Dexter is even better. The 12 episodes in Season 1 offer a fluency that most series do not. It tells a complete story and leaves just enough of a \\"cliff-hanger\\" to make you anxious for Season 2.The characters are developed and you sympathize with each of them...even the cold-blood killer!

0425220931|5.0|I was a bit turned off by the sub-title.  I have very little interest in the spiritual perspective of the world's greatest bass player.    I was grateful that I could read the first chapter online, which sets the tone for the entire book.    The Music Lesson is a fun, entertaining exploration of music from a fictional perspective.  There are many important lessons and ideas about music in each chapter.  Many of these lessons trigger more questions than answers, which is Victor's way of expressing the importance of self-discovery and \\"finding your own voice\\".    I was blessed to attend one of Victor's Bass / Nature camps, so I was able to experience Victor's approach to inspiring others to experience music.  I learned to get past my academic background of music theory and explore music with the mind of a child.    I still recommend learning theory, but also recommend this book as a fun read and an opportunity to think of music in a refreshing light.

The rest you, all in general, haven't heard about at all! \\"Incesticide\\" is the compilation record on which we can find more or less everything Nirvana had performed back to the 80's (\\"Bleach\\" not included). The songs are fascinating, leading to the realism in music which the author himself surely had on his mind writing and performing. There are also a few cover songs. Whether or not you are a Nirvana fan the choice is up to you cos' this is my favorite but the world did it's and \\"Nevermind\\" is the band's multiplatinum record. However, I kindly recommend to buy this record.

B000OVLINI|5.0|Life in post World War II Spain, fractured family relationships, loves lost and found, mysteries and murder, coming of age, and the treasures of books are all themes wonderfully woven together in this novel.  Don't pass up the opportunity to read this book...and be sure to leave a couple of hours of uninterrupted time to finish the last half as you won't want to put it down!  My only wish was that my Spanish was good enough to read the original as some of the translation was a bit anachronistic...some of the sayings were clearly more modern than the times in which the story takes place.  Certainly not a big detractor though.  Felt a little odd to be reading a story centered around a love of books on my Kindle too!
B00008RH3L|2.0|I actually like some of the Coen brothers movies, but this isn't one of them.  Sure, it's smart and well photographed and it's clever and has the Coen brothers style stamped on it.  But, for me, none of that justifies the violence.  Yes, you can send me nasty comments but I promise not to read them so don't bother.  Why do I suspect that the majority of rave reviews here are from men?  Why do I suspect that Mrs. Coen must have beaten her boys bloody at a very early age?  Why else are they sooooo obsessed with blood.  Maybe they were weaned on video games or machine guns...who knows what created these obsessions?!    Our hero here, the very charming Gabriel Byrne gets beaten and almost shot so many times that I lost count.  Unfortunately, I had to shut down all of my senses just to survive this film that I stopped caring.  I guess that's how all the characters survived...just stop caring and you can do any bloody thing.  Personally I don't care how in style the Coens are I think they should both go into therapy for a long, long time.     The reason why I'm giving it any stars at all is the same reason I sat through it---Gabriel Byrne.  (A female perspective.)
B0009F2EPU|4.0|This Bayreuth centennial production of Wagner's Ring is historically one of the most celebrated and scandalous in the entire history of the festival. It's strengths and weaknesses have been well documented for over thirty years, from the controversial staging by a young filmmaker to the consistancy (or lack of) of the cast.     Although the cast is a group of some of the best Wagnerians at time, it is sometimes painfully obvious that not every generation has a Nilsson/Flagstad/Melchior caliber of singer, but over all the music is served well. Gwyneth Jones in particle was inconsitant vocally, her upper register at times sounding worn, flapping in the breeze uncontrollably. On a good day however, she could sing like an absolute goddess. Here she is NOT a goddess, but her high notes don't flap either....at least not too much. Her strongest point in this production is her stage acting...she is intense and unashamedly committed to Chereau's direction. Her Siegfried, Manfred Jung, is serviceable and not much more, which isn't neccesarily a bad thing considering the demands of the role. Jung also stepped in at the last minute a few years later and saved the Solti/Hall Ring when Reiner Goldberg fizzled out. Also notable is a young Peter Hoffman as Siegmund near the start of his short operatic career. Overall the singers may not be great, but they are good.    Chereau's Marxist 19th century setting is definitely not to everyone's taste, but at least he has specific ideas that work, for good or bad.    While Chereau's direction is cutting edge and exciting, it is Brian Large's camera work that is the major flaw in this set. He has been called the most musical video director today with a keen eye for detail, but detail can be nothing and even destroy art if you miss the forest for the trees. To completely ignore the entire production because of a fascination with the second tenor from the left, or to ignore Desdemona's death just to get an extreme close-up of Placido Domingo's right eye and nostril, or to edit out the end of Don Carlos because we have to see Nicolai Ghiaurov in close up pining away, is downright heinous. While close ups add to the theatrical experience when done correctly at appropriate times, it should NOT be done at the expense of the entire production. At times I wish they had set up a single camera dead center with the entire stage in view...and left it alone. It is absolutely maddening to be forced for eternity to watch a small fraction of the drama with a flicker of flame in the corner of the screen, or obvious stage action just off-camera. Thank heavens Mr. Large didn't direct something like Ben-Hur or no one would ever know who won the chariot race since the camera would be zoomed in on some Judean Noble-person in row 47.    Overall, this is a memorable document of one of the high points in Bayreuth's controversial history, permantly marred by subjectively selective camera work.
B0002SROSQ|5.0|He never seems to amaze me. I only recently got into him. In Australia his albums are so cheap so I went on a binge and bought pretty much all of them in one epic purchase (when they are 8 dollars AUS each it is a wicked deal) I am just so amazed by his depth and the development of his maturity over the course of his entire career. He would have thought the man who sung in Birthday Party could write something so beautiful and moving as O Children. Everyone should own his records and most of the enjoyment is in his lyrics as well. Thank God fopr Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie again after many years. The transfer to DVD was excellent. Great quality picture and sound.
B00026WU64|5.0|he was so young and he learned to make blues of his own. what a genius! the first song appeared in Forest Gump, that's the first time I heard it.
0307237702|4.0|I feel almost as if I know Mr. Obama, personally, after reading this book.  It contains a candid look at the life of this politician and explains his point of view on a variety of issues.  All of this is accomplished with enough logic and humor to make it a good and easy read - even for someone who prefers fiction.
0143143492|5.0|I am really enjoying this book and the online discussions. Most of the concepts are revealing to me and some hard to wrap my brain around!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Dexter is the kind of quality that television could be and generally isn't.  It's so sad to see television taken over by superficial cheap reality shows when it should be so much more.  Thankfully with that kind of trash on, we need only one or two hours of Dexter quality programs a week to satisfy our television craving.  From the foreboding opening credits until the ending, Dexter grabs your attention.  And, the show deserves it.  We're waiting for next season and hopefully many more after that.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|To nit-pick, the main character wasn't as ugly as in the book.  As someone who read the book, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie -   What a successful book-to-movie!
B00005214X|5.0|I first bought this while in the U.S. Navy. Now I have it on CD.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|When I first heard the c.d I was unsure. But as with any good c.d this one really grows on you. It was a great purchase and would recommend it to any Radiohead fan.
B000002UCN|5.0|Until this album I did not know George wrote most of the most memorable songs by the Beatles.
0896760839|5.0|You must have this book!!!! The historical information in the front of this book is truly exhaustive. This tome is methodically done. Starting with the art from the period, Arnold traces the cut and design of garments throughout the period, giving extant primary source documentation. She then recreates the garment in patterns in the back half of the book. If you want to know precisely how Elizabethan garments were worn, or wish to look as though you have stepped directly from this period in history, this book will be peerless in your library.
B0001611DI|4.0|The original Dawn of the Dead is scarier than the remake, this was the second or third cult film of the George Romero's Zombie movies  (although the word \\"Zombie\\"\\" is never said in any of his movies).  Good to see Tom Savini in both the original and the remake of \\"Dawn of the Dead\\".  Another great horror film!
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|I purchased this cd over 2 years ago and I still get chills when I listen to 30 Seconds to Mars!!! They're AWESOME....I love their song From Yesterday and of course The Kill is great....I know what I know and I likes what I likes...So I likes 30 Seconds....This CD has well lived up to its expectations for me.....Give them a try and you'll be HOOKED!!! Jared has a very good sexy screaming voice..so that has to be like an added bonus or something don't you think?......(:
0790729601|5.0|all i can say is that i love this movie   lots and lots of action
B000FBGBPC|5.0|When I heard their hit song Animal I have become on the radio on my way home from work stuck in traffic I fell hard for it....then I got the album and that song was ok after I heard Never too late and Riot....those two climbed the charts for me in an instant and I knew right then and there in that very moment Three Days Grace's One X album was a purchase I was glad I made!!
1402529651|5.0|Stephanie Plum, the character in these books, is a riot.  She gets into the type of trouble we wish we could but not dare.  Love the two hunks in her life and her family are real characters especially her Grandma and Mother.  The only problem is the reader, she's ok but I wish the original reader from book one and two had continued to read all the books. This reader is a little dull and has no range for changing characters.  But if you can get past her voice to the story you'll love it.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|This CD is just wonderful and features all the songs from the movie in the order they were performed. Anyone who likes The Beatles or good \\"listening to\\" music would be happy to have this disk.
0452289963|5.0|This book arrived quickly and in excellent condition as described. It's a book that you need to really contemplate when reading. There is a wealth of info here.
0375831002|5.0|I ordered this book on a whim and without a doubt this is my best impulse purchase ever. Wonderfully written, Zusak has such a beautiful way with words that I spent most of the novel gasping at the stark yet stunning descriptions of people, places, and events.     Though marketed as a young adult book, I would hesitate to assign it to readers who haven't reached an 11th grade level. That said, most of us know some people reach that level at the age of twelve. The reason I say this is because this novel needs to be appreciated for its content and themes, and  the empathy readers develop for the characters could be difficult for those who haven't developed maturity yet.     I love this novel so much-- it was a treat to read. The words went down like a delicious cup of coffee, smooth and calming. Death Himself makes a fabulous narrator and his views on humanity add a refreshing and dark twist to this tale of life and death in World War II.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This movie had us laughing and enjoying the personality they gave to mice. Loved it!
B0007Y89ZM|3.0|I first saw the Eagles play in concert when I was 16, some many years ago, and paid 98 bucks for the ticket (not a trivial amount for me back then).  They arrived late on the stage, but they made up for it, with the beginning riff to 'Hotel California',  'Life in the fast lane', and 'Life is good' by Joe Walsh.    This DVD is somewhat of a miss from what I have grown to love about the Eagles.  Their performance, with the entire band sitting in chairs while carefully expressing their craft, is a subdued experience of audial heights.  I would have liked more life in this performance, not a bunch of old guys acting geriatric.    On the other hand, the songs are rendered as only the Eagles can render them.  If you are looking for a rollicking performance by one of the greatest bands, then maybe another DVD is more appropriate.  But if you are looking for a more serene listen to a classic group, then this DVD might be right for you.
B00005YU1O|5.0|Richard Linklater's film Waking Life is all about dreaming, and how we can sometimes lucidly control our dreams. Waking Life is a must see movie. Though at some times you may feel like it's too much to handle in one movie, there are so many different, exciting, existential ideas brought up. If you have the chance to watch it multiple times, i would suggest doing so, because if you only watch it once, there is a lot you can miss. Many of the characters in the movie are actually playing themselves as they explain certain buddhists, existentialists, or situationists ideas. Overall, this movie poses the question of, how can we lead a life that is more awake, more aware of people and things, more authentic?
0792165020|5.0|One of my favorite movies.  Matt Damon's performance is perfect, Jude Law is wonderful and Gwyneth Paltrow is luminescent.  It is mysterious, haunting, and thought provoking.  The acting is intense and masterful and you cannot help but be drawn into the story.  The complex layers of the characters are slowly revealed and wonderfully portrayed.
0385338600|4.0|I find John Grissom to be an excelloent writter.    I find it hard to put down.
0618918248|5.0|Better than expected! I think the religious can gain more from this than non-believers do. Unless they're hopelessly (and unfortunately) close minded.
B001041JKU|5.0|This CD was fantastic!  I Love it.  The new songs are great, and I even like the new \\"The Girl is Mine\\" way better than the original.  Michael Jackson was ahead of his time, and the Thriller 25 collection proves, that his music is timeless.
B000YMBBH0|5.0|These movies are great and watching them in Hi-Def makes the experience that much more enjoyable. I can say I have both Blu-ray and HD-DVD look basically the same.  Now that HD-DVD has lowered in price I plan on stocking up big time.  The Bourne trilogy is one of the few that subsequent sequels are better than (or at the very least equal) than the first. And at this price!! Make sure you get this..
B000W4D27C|5.0|Remember when \\"FluXion\\" and \\"Aeolian\\" were first meant to be released as a double album, yet it ended up that they were released as two separate albums, yet people didn't mind? Well, two years after \\"Aeolian\\", we have \\"Precambrian\\", a concept double album based around the earliest known times from thousands of millions of years ago, yet described in abstract form to make things less obvious.<br /><br />The first disc, known as \\"Hadean/Archean\\" can easily be called an EP, as it clocks in at 22 minutes. These songs are in an aggressive style for the band, with its share of polyrhythmic structures and everything usually has the pace picked up. It gets you ready for the second disc, which they call \\"Proterozoic\\". This is definitely the superior disc, not just because of length, but because everything is executed so flawlessly by a large soundscape of crushing guitars, violins, piano, drums, and other various forms of percussion, including the xylophone and the chimes. Each song is written is a beautiful and structured matter, yet it retains that aggression that \\"Hadean/Archean\\" had you pumped up with.<br /><br />If you want to listen to this album in the best way, play it from beginning to end. This isn't an album meant for shuffle, or an album with any singles on it, it's a breathtaking concept album with a very dynamic performance.
0066620996|5.0|Fascinating case studies and example from the business world of success, failure and the reason for both.  This is a good read for anyone interested in transforming their business or organization.  More than that, it's a great read for anyone who is even part of a business or organization.
B000Y7U98W|5.0|This movie didn't do so well in the box office, but let it be said that it's definitely a movie to own. The clarity of all the cg visuals is amazing in HI Definition and the sound was mixed extremely well.<br /><br />The story line is a great mix of many genres. Many whom aren't fans of the SCIFI Genre will still enjoy this movie.
B000IU3XTW|3.0|This is a good live, acoustic album but it could have been better. I always think that Nirvana's \\"Live in New York\\" is the standard-bearer for these types of albums and this doesn't come close.  That being said this is still an enjoyable album full of good music. I would've liked to have heard it possible in a more intimate venue and stripped-down even more.
B000000OF6|5.0|good selection of most of Queen's best songs. I wish Princes of the Universe was included, but one can't have everything.
0810994739|3.0|Our whole family loved the first Wimpy Kid Book so picking this one up was a no brainer. Rodrick Rules just didn't have as many laughs as the first volume. My son still tore through it, but he hasn't re-read it several times as he did Wimpy Kid 1. Not terrible, but not laugh out loud funny either.
0307383415|5.0|I HAVE ENJOYED READING THIS BOOK. HE(OBAMA) IS A TRUE SPIRIT. IT JUST GOES TO SHOW THAT NO MATTER WHAT PROBLEMS YOU HAVE IN LIFE, YOU CAN GET THROUGH THEM.
B00127RAJY|5.0|WOW!  I love this DVD.  I work out 5 days a week and Level 1 kicked my butt.  My heart rate stayed high throughout the entire workout and I was even a bit sore the next day.  I loved it!  If you want to sweat and see results, get this.  Go ahead and add it to your cart!    I'm starting Level 2 today and I'm scared!!
B000K15VSA|5.0|I loved the DVD version -- not sure how much better a dark and foggy film like this would be in HD.<br />The Spinner toy is cool, but a little shoddy in fit and finish --- I looked for the Ford logo.<br /><br />The picture quality is very good.<br /><br />The features were awesome -- especially the head replacement fix on the kick-murder replicant.<br /><br />The full-body photo of Cassidy with snake made me cry for hours!!!  Good gawd what a beautiful Woman:<br />too bad I wouldn't live long ... but then again, who does ? And she's even gorgeouser in the head-fix feature , after all these years.<br /><br />Now, with apologies to the more intellectual types, I happen to like the voice-over original best. Far from<br />being insulting to my intelligence, I get a \\"flavor\\" of the old detective movies from the voice-over.<br /><br />ONE THING --- I saw the original in a theater in Tampa, FL and I could swear that Harrison Ford ordered and got FISH EYE SOUP at the diner and actually slurped up one of them with chopsticks ( he wanted 4 eyes but the lady insisted on two ).<br /><br />When I saw fish on his plate, I was surprised. I remember this because it anticipated the later scene where the genetic engineer / eye specialist  is  garnished with frozen eyeballs before he is killed.<br /><br />It bothers me no end that even this \\"ULTIMATE\\" collection doesn't have the one I saw first.<br /><br />---gooddog<br /><br />/<br /> : * ]  AAAaaaRRRrrrFFFff !!!<br />\<br /><br />*************************************************
B0000CEB4V|5.0|\\"A Concert For George\\" is an absolute masterpiece of a tribute to a great artist and great man.  It is difficult to find words to express the surpurlatives deserving of this DVD. I'm sure George Harrison was smiling over his friends as they performed his songs, and every time this DVD plays in someone's living room, George is smiling again.<br />The emotions dramatized by the artists participating in this utterly moving tribute to their beloved friend are electrifying and real.  This DVD is hands-down my all time favorite.  I had not been a great George Harrison fan until I watched this DVD and observed these musician/friends playing tribute to his brilliant body of work.  I now recognize George's contribution to the Beatles and the music world in general.  I couldn't help but wonder if the power duo of Lennon-McCartney had held him back, and what other amazing contributions he could have made to the Beatle's library had he been given the chance.<br />For example, I didn't know until watching this DVD that it was George who authored my favorite Beatles songs:  \\"Here Comes the Sun, and \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps.\\"  When Eric Clapton sings \\"Beware of Darkness,\\" only a cretin could watch this stirring performance and not be moved to tears.  Billy Preston, singing his spine-tingling rendition of \\"Isn't It A Pity,\\" is particularly poignant, as Billy, sadly, is no longer with us.<br />For a touching, spiritual experience, not to mention an opportunity to hear some of our finest musicians at their musical and spiritual height as they pay tribute to their beloved friend George, please check out this DVD. Read the details on Amazon regarding the many other exceptional artists participating in this project, (put together by George's great friend, Eric) and the fabulous Harrison songs they cover.  You'll not regret it.  RIP, George.
0618918248|4.0|Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist by trade and atheist by heart, delivers a discerning argument for the non-existence of a supreme spiritual being.  The premise of his position revolves around a complex matrix of probability concepts.  In short, the main tenet to his mathematical equations is that God, if he or she, or it existed, would rule over zillions of people, planets and universes and would know each and every detail of every second of every day.  He dismisses this assertion as possible, but improbable.  In other words, it could be true but is has not been proven yet, nor is it likely to ever be proven because of the extremely low odds that it is possible for one being to have such supernatural powers.  On top of this, he satirically comments that if the aforementioned premise was correct - then who designed the designer (and the designer's designer and so forth and so on)?  He resists faith based arguments from religious zealots and favors the \\"non-believing' zealots of yesteryear such as Darwin, Jefferson, and Twain.  This book is more than just a rejection of the belief in God, it is an amalgamation of most contemporary and traditional religious and non-religious beliefs.  Whether one agrees with Dawkins or not, one should applaud his passion and exhaustive research in completing this tremendous narrative.  A re-occuring theme throughout the book is the reliance on scientific evidence (i.e. Darwinism) and the somewhat minimization of historical writings.  More discussion about the bible as a historical text would have added to Dawkin's themes and conclusions.  Regardless, this is a thought provoking work and one that has elicited over one-thousand book reviews on Amazon alone.  I look forward to reading Dawkin's next work.
B000ENUYFY|5.0|Men in Black - one of our favorite all-time Will Smith movies along with the sequel.  I sent a few movies to a disabled child and this was one of them.  Laughter makes the heart glad - this is a movie that makes you laugh and makes you glad.
B0013FDM7E|5.0|I didn't see it in the movie theater, I decided to wait until it came out on DVD.  I decided to purchase it because my nephew said I would like it, and he was right.  However, if you are a dog lover like I am, you Will cry when Will Smith has to put the dog down (I did).  This movie was long,but it keeps you on edge.  Both endings are GREAT,  I see why the kept the ending in the theater and it makes sense, I will not give too much info on this.  This was a great film, Will Smith was great, his best performance I have to say.  You will not be disappointment at all.
B00006AUIG|5.0|i concur with many of my fellow writers in that i think you've got to be smart and/or chronologically mature enough to appreciate just how brilliant this film is . one of the very best horror films of its' decade . try putting on the closed captions or subtitles if you struggle with the great britain character's dialogue . awesome film in any category . must see
B0010X73ZG|3.0|This was a pretty good movie, pretty fast paced, a little scary.  The cast was good.  However the ending is SOOOOO Messed up.  This movie will not disappoint!!!
B00132D808|4.0|After a few listens, one thing has become abundantly clear to me about this album; that being that I absolutely cannot listen to it without a grin on my face.  Strip away all the fan rage and cries of \\"lost potential\\" and what you have here is literally the feel good album of the year.  In stark contrast to the biting sarcasm and quick lyrical jabs of [[ASIN:B000AMJDHY their first album]], this one seems to be the guys sitting down to just have a genuinely good time.  And you know what?  That's okay.    For everybody lamenting the change in sound and crying betrayal, just remember what these guys told you in their first track from Fever You Can't Sweat Out.  \\"We're still so young...\\".  And they really are.  At an average age of 21, these guys still have an immeasurably long amount of years ahead of them to continue to change and refine their sound.  Just relax and enjoy the ride.
B000U7169M|4.0|I must say this moving was not bad at all.  This movies was fast paced and direct to the point.  I thought I was going to be disappointment, but I was impressed with this film.
0452289963|5.0|[[ASIN:0141027592 A New Earth]]  Sharply clear follow-up to The Power of Now.  Has more detail on how to work on relationships using the PON principles.  Heart-opening (and mind blowing)truth on every page.  This book has the potential to lift the level of consciousnesss of vast numbers of people.
B0011FDVKE|4.0|More like \\"Bramble Rose\\" than \\"Tambourine\\".  Check out \\"I Know What I'm Looking For Now,\\" \\"Broken,\\" and \\"Something To Me\\".  :-)
B0000019P9|5.0|How Strange It Is to Be Anything At All    The simple philosophical truth of those words hit me every time I listen to it again. It's so powerful... so meaningful.  And not just that phrase- the entire album is one long poem of truth. Every time I listen to it (and I listen to it often) I get some new insight or some new thought is inspired by it.     Jeff Mangum says that he wrote it as one long song with different themes and sections which I can see. However, this does not mean in any way that it is repetitive.      I don't think it matters what kind of music you like.  THe sheer power and meaning of this album will overwhelm you, rapper or instrumental, punk or metal, soft or emo.     I would suggest it to anyone.
B0009A21R6|5.0|I am not a big fan of Dire Straight, but his album has it all.  I truly beautiful sound and well put together album.
6305907145|5.0|I love this updated video version of Jane Austen's Mansfield Park. It is easy to follow and great to watch. I had rented this from my library and dedcided this needed to be in my favorite dvd collection. I have seen the other versions(all are good)but just really liked this one.
159562015X|5.0|This book provides a great tool for looking at your strengths and the strengths of peers you work with or know. I would recommend this to anyone.
0452289963|5.0|This is the best book I have read in 20 years! So insightful and compelling. Once you pick it up you will have a hard time putting down. A must read for everyone.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|This movie tied up the loose ends of the series very well.  It was a satisfying conclusion to the final season.  Good effects and well written, IMO.
1577314808|5.0|This is possibly the most powerful and insightful book on spirituality ever written. The most amazing thing about it is its clarity - its account of the workings of the human minds is truly stunning. Like no other book I've read, it has an enlightening effect as you read it - you can feel the clarity and insight spreading to you. It has led me on to another amazing book called the Fall by Steve Taylor, which is highly recommended by Eckhart on his website. [[ASIN:1905047207 The Fall: The Evidence for a Golden Age, 6,000 years of Insanity and the Dawning of a New Era]] The Fall provides a historical and cultural context to Eckhart's work, showing the ego's terrible effects throughout history and suggesting that, as a species, we are now beginning to transcend it.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|From the hilarious opening scene, which is quintessential Irish humor, this movie delivers.  I love the characters, I love the music, I love the feeling of being in Dublin (not the romanticized tourist Dublin, and not the bleak anti-romantic Dublin, but the real Dublin as it is today).  The ending is a delightful surprise, and the movie has leaped ahead to my all-time favorites!
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|Top Tracks....<br />Man-Sized Wreath- Crunchy guitars and Mikey Stipe's vocals are amazing.<br />Supernatural Superserious- Best single they've released since Bad Day from the Greatest Hits cd.<br />Houston- Great song about Texas.<br />Until The Day is Done- amazing melody and the lyrics are great.<br />Mr. Ricards- Probably one of my fave R.E.M. songs!<br /><br />i give this 5 stars not because its R.E.M. its just an amazing record
B000SZLSB2|4.0|This CD is more than I expected, although it did come with the outside casing cracked.  The CD itself seems to be fine, though.
0452287588|4.0|This is a book that can be enjoyed by persons of all genders and all walks of life.  Persons with advanced degrees in psychology and social services will find very little that is new and thought-provoking, but the book speaks to a number of persons in the general population. It is also quite enjoyable to take part in the weekly discussions of the book with the author and Oprah Winfrey that are available on our computers. I think that we will see much more of the phenomenon of world wide computer participation in the future, and this book was a good vehicle to ride into the future.
0375757856|5.0|I am not a big fan of mystery novels.  However, I'd have to agree that  \\"The Moonstone\\"  may not only the first and longest, but also the best   detective novel ever written.  The story is told from the viewpoint of a number  of characters, and the writing style varies accordingly.  The storytellers vividly  paint the different characters, while they are themselves brought to life   through the idiosyncracies of their writing.  There is not a single, central   mystery, but a web of unexplained occurrences and actions that each writer  presents from his or her own view, adding bits of information in the process.  Therefore the fun is as much in the construction of the web of mysteries  surrounding the disappearance of the Moonstone, as in the eventual resolution.    The plot is somewhat intricate, but not too difficult to follow.  In brief, a very   satisfying book.
0452289963|5.0|I love the Power of Now but I think A New Earth is even more profound and lucid. I find that this book - like all Eckhart's books, but this one has it even stronger - has an almost uncanny power. Somehow you can feel the wisdom it contains seeping into you as you read and taking you a little closer to realisation. This book gives you a profound understanding of how the ego works, and after reading it you are never quite the same person again. We are amazingly lucky that Eckhart possesses such an acute intellectual mind with an enlightened spiritual state. (The two don't often go together.) I've also been reading books recommended on Eckhart's website, including another stunning book called The Fall by Steve Taylor. [[ASIN:1905047207 The Fall: The Evidence for a Golden Age, 6,000 years of Insanity and the Dawning of a New Era]] It goes together very well with A New Earth. The Fall goes very deeply into the origins of the ego and its insanity and compliments Eckhart's profound analysis.
B000UNYJXQ|4.0|Different than a typical Moore movie.  The majority of the information is from personal testimony other than his.
0452289963|5.0|The book arrived in excellent condition, in an appropriate time.  Along with Oprah's weekly review and lesson plan, it has been an interesting read.  Eckhart Tolle strives to make the reader become involved as each chapter is written as only he can.  Not yet finished reading the book, I look forward to applying his lessons to my life, and would recommend this book to anyone trying to make sense of his or her life.
B00111YM5G|3.0|If you liked UNDERWORLD, but thought it would be better with Angels (called Arcs) and Demons (called the Fallen) instead of Vampires and Werewolves (called Lycans), then your dreams have just been answered! This movie is really stupid, and it consists mainly of bad actors standing around talking about a comic book version of metaphysics, but it is so poorly thought out and executed, it is fascinating and wonderful. Try to follow the confused philosophy that is being chewed on and explained through the entire film. Attempt to understand the logic of the BIG SHOCK waiting for you in the last 20 minutes. Make a list of all the scenes that are lifted directly from other films. Absolute Heaven for lovers of Bad Cinema! Also, is Samantha Noble so ugly she's beautiful or so beautiful she's ugly? I really couldn't figure it out, but I couldn't take my eyes off her. I will watch every film she's in for the rest of my life. As I  watched this, I kept thinking, \\"It's Ed Wood with access to a computer!\\"

1400032717|1.0|I read this one as a part of the book club - I've seen the book around and was interested but found it bitterly disappointing.  There are gimmicks galore - the chapter numbers are in primes, there's several puzzles inserted into the text - but very little, if any substance.  Additionally by writing the story from the point of the autistic teenager the author is limiting himself to a subset of language, emotions, etc - I'd have been much more impressed if the author told the story in the third person.  We're all grown ups here, we can handle it.     Don't bother, in short.

B000I0RR76|5.0|Nothing I can add to this Classic Flynn adventure that has not been said previously. Bursting with Stars and spectacular scenery. The HD version adds a bit of sparkle and updated sound quality. If you have somehow missed this movie or DVD then the HD version is a great choice.

B00006JKLI|4.0|I couldn't own this album as a young fan because my mother said it was the devil's music.  I waited until I joined the military 7 years after it was released.  The first album I ever purchased and I still have the  very well worn piece of vinyl. The DVD-A version brings back so many memories, I can't say it is better than the original but it is certainly worth the purchase if you can find it at a reasonalbe cost. Don't sell yourself short with this format, calibrate your surround sound system and make sure you give it the bass extension that was present on the original.  You won't be sorry.

This book is a great glimpse of Paul Bonner's imagination and world that is very inspiring, not just for other illustrators but for anyone with an imagination.
B0000AJ595|5.0|Life For Rent is an excellent album through and through, in fact I can say honestly it's one of my favorites in my entire collection.  The singles \\"White Flag\\" and \\"Sand in My Shoes\\" typify the tone and character of the other tracks.  Unlike some other records, ones in which you listen to your favorite single then leave it on the shelf, this one has what it takes to be a classic.
B0010YSD7M|3.0|I'm disappointed in the direction that the series has taken.  I won't buy another \\"Movie\\" continuation of Stargate, until it has Movie quality.  This was nothing more than a long episode.  And they also didn't seem to have the same energy as they once did.  Maybe they should just give it up and concentrate on the Atlantis spin off.

1400064287|5.0|This book was recommended to me with much fervor, so I had to see what the shouting was about. Now that I've read it, I can see why it's so highly regarded.<br /><br />The premise of Made to Stick is that we all want to communicate well, and we want our message to be understood and remembered. While not _everything_ we say needs to be memorable, we do care about getting our point across... and having someone care enough about that point to take action.<br /><br />That may sound as though the book is primarily for people in the business of communicating, such as advertising professionals, teachers, salespeople, or politicians. But anyone in business needs to sell her message. You want to convince the boss that your proposal is a good one. You need to get your tech team to understand the point of the project, so that they can make good decisions even when (inevitably) the reality doesn't match the project plan. You want your kids to buy into your values.<br /><br />This could have become a pedantic tome with lots of \\"Thou Shalt\\" pronouncements. But the Heath brothers have written an enjoyable, engaging book that is _very_ readable and -- well, duh -- memorable. They apply their own advice, with lots of concrete examples, plenty of storytelling, and \\"simple\\" explanations (in the sense of \\"easy to understand\\" not \\"dumbed down\\"). At least a dozen times while I was reading the book, I interrupted my husband to say, \\"Hey, let me read you this, it's really great --\\"<br /><br />I had several \\"Aha!\\" moments, even though I've been a journalist (and thus professional communicator) for many years. The story the Heaths imparted about Nora Ephron's high school journalism teacher will probably stay with me forever; and gosh, I had thought I already *knew* how to write a lead paragraph!<br /><br />This book is fun as well as immediately useful. Highly recommended.
B000H7J9QM|3.0|If you like action car chase scences the chase of Elenor the vintage Mustang is great as far as picture quality and sound it is one of the best I have seen so far.

B000YXMMAE|5.0|...to make a fantastic record.  if you're not sure if you'd like this record go to youtube and check out the version of \\"bodysnatchers\\" from the jools holland show, pick your jaw up off the floor, and then buy it.  like most radiohead it requires repeated listening to really \\"get it\\", but this one is much more accessible to the non-initiated than some others.  nice flow, nice songs, and nice spacey feel.    i saw about half of this album performed live at bonnaroo in 2006 and was not prepared for how well the band managed to capture that same energy level and hypnotic mood on \\"in rainbows\\", and without record company direction to boot.  as a diehard fan it's hard for me to write an unbiased review, but i bought a copy of this album for a less diehard friend of mine who declared it to be \\"their best since the bends,\\" which is a high compliment from this individual.    my only complaint is that the companion disc, an excellent followup or continuation of this cd, is only available via the box set.  i have a copy so it's not inconvenient to me, but i think that it's a bummer to deny the rest of the album to the general public.     while you can't name your price here on amazon, it's quite reasonable and definitely worth it.  what are you waiting for?

075640407X|5.0|I heard about this book through the grapevine, as a few of my friends sung its praises.    Ladies and gentleman, I was not disappointed.    This story deals with a meta-narrative as older Kvothe recounts his younger years.  The narrative seamlessly transfers between the third and first person perspectives, and Patrick Rothfuss makes it interesting.  Rothfuss has razor wit, and whether it be older Kvothe's sharp tongue or younger Kvothe's fascinating intelligence, I was absolutely hooked on every word.    There are points where the story slows down, sure, but it is warranted.  Make no mistake: this book is excellently paced, and while some parts of this book's believability may seem questionable, such as when Denna is high.  But if you're a college student, then it is totally believable, as this randomness does happen.     Kvothe's smart yet hot-headed temper, fixation with money, curiosity and eagerness make him a well rounded-character.  He maybe be a miracle-student and have a large destiny ahead of him, but that doesn't stop him from falling flat on his face.  Rothfuss makes excellent social commentary and truly understands what it means to be young, nearly broke and aloof.    This is a book not to be missed.

I watched the commercial until I could read the name of the artist playing the piano and singing.

B000AMPZF8|5.0|This album, foolishly not released in the US for four years because of a record label dispute with the band over its use of falsetto vocals, puts Muse in the British rock pantheon.  While the band's first album (recorded around age 20 or 21) was clearly Radiohead-derived, Origin finds the band expanding its horizons and producing the intense, prog masterpiece that established their reputation.    A solid record with XERO weak tracks, highlights include the guitar rifflicious \\"Plug In Baby,\\" the Rachmaninov-derived \\"Space Dementia,\\"  and the all-falsetto baroque \\"Micro Cuts,\\" as well as the power-pop cover of \\"Feeling Good\\" and the concert staple \\"New Born.\\"  \\"Citizen Erased\\" is another fan favorite.  You really can't go wrong!    The production values aren't as slick and polished as those on \\"Absolution,\\" and the songs not nearly as pop as those on \\"Black Holes.\\"  But if you want intense, powerful, emotional music--and you want to know how Muse achieved the reputation they have (outside of their concerts)--THIS is the album to pick up.
B0002V7O3I|3.0|I stumbled upon this movie in our family's archive of recorded videos. I was caught into watching it from the very beginning, a great story, and the acting was good. Then in the last 30 min. of the movie everything went terribly downhill. Either someone was trying to make a point or they ran out of budget, but believe me this movie is not worth watching, well the end anyways. Watch it only up to the point where they get into space, then turn it off. You'll be much happier.

B00008BRB5|2.0|In the late 70's, early 80's, there was a monstrous black hole, completely devoid of talent, from which, every two years or so, 3 hit singles and a No.1 album would be spewed unapologetically out.<br /><br />The Police (splendidly ironic name, given the crimes they regularly got away with), are guilty as charged, and their last somnambulistic studio album; all gaseous protest and Caribbean sun-tanned 'caring' = an absolute drag.<br /><br />To be fair(!) there's actually a couple of good songs on 'Synchronicity'. 'Every Breath' is fairly strong but 'Synchronicity II' is a revelation.<br />Where Gordon dug this up is a mystery; steaming rock guitar riffing and passionate vocals? - steady on there boys! The irony can't have been lost on him; the powerful left-wing lyrics must've seemed particularly appropriate as he sat in the recording studio in the Bahamas or wherever.(This at a time when all these so-called darling groups went to Montserrat or the Riviera to record albums. Why is beyond me, each and every one came back a disaster. Check out the Durannies, or even the Happy Mondays for irrefutable proof.)<br />It has an exiting prog-style 'II' in the title, perhaps that's where Gordon's loyalties really lie; Cocktail Prog(!) and sticks out like a sore thumb from the calculated, moribund rest of 'Synchronicity'<br /><br />After the exertions of 'II', it's pretty obvious Gordon and the rest of the band (Andy Summers; been going longer than Pink Floyd and The Who PUT TOGETHER and Stewart Copeland; a lanky twit drummer with a style borrowed from that one off the Muppets), were worn out, so they put down a pile of filler and headed off to the beach for a lie down.<br />Summers (and the first time any-one wrote about him, they were using 12-point copperplate and quills!) is particularly dull: get up, play some feeble guitar, lie on the beach, have a little drink and a snooze... Collect cash. Nice work if you can get it.<br /><br />Being dreary isn't a crime in rock otherwise we'd have anarchy, so he can't shoulder much of the blame for 'Synchronicity'. The finger of accusation must point at Gordon, who is determined to stamp his creative authority on proceedings and not give a hoot his 'creativity' isn't worth a jot.<br />He waffles on about mothers and murderers in abject isolation, thinking he's being really insightful and interesting but in reality, he's boring every-one rigid.<br /><br />There's two words I always try to use in my reviews. One is 'looney', which doesn't really apply here - and the other is 'worthy'; a horrid, nasty word implying the worst nadir of any art-form and one that could've been specially coined for Gordon.<br />The 80's was full of 'worthies'. Lacklustre half-talents (and if for some reason you want to check 'em out, have a butchers at the 'Do They Know it's Christmas' video - most of them are on there), any surprise or originality long since ebbed away, but still wanting to be seen to be DOING THEIR BIT.<br /><br />Gordon was king in this company. 'Hey, I'm a working class millionaire but never mind me; look at this rain forest guy with a plate in his lip that I've dragged halfway across the world and put on TV in a dire and misguided attempt to show how caring I really am in my millions' (And I've got a solo album out that nobody's buying!). The worst kind of pop star, one who's filament wasn't blinding to begin with but ending up being as weak and uncomfortable as the poor rain forest guy - thousands of miles from home, plonked like a freak-show in completely alien surroundings, but still having a nobility and charisma Gordon can only drool after. I hear all this desperation and thinly disguised self-aggrandizement running like veins through all of Gordon's 'work' and here it's at an annoyingly high level.<br /><br />To say 'Synchronicity' is limp is like saying Hitler was slightly misled. Gordon may think he's walking on rocks wild side but he's not really fooling any-one. We can all see whatever limited talent he once had has now run completely dry, and all the faux roots, jazzy licks and lounge crooning in the world won't change that.<br /><br />I don't normally feel sympathy for people like Gordon. Working class people who've made many millions from other working class people who will 'like' a certain music because it's conspiratorially drummed into them but allow me a twinge: 'Synchronicity' may be insipid and lukewarm, but it's 'Astral Weeks' compared to his solo work.<br />It should've been called 'Sycophantically'. Geddit?roots, jazzy licks and lounge crooning in the world won't change that.    I don't normally feel sympathy for people like Gordon.

Shortly afterward, again on Beaker Street, I heard \\"Tuesday's Gone\\" and \\"Freebird\\" and that was that--I had to get this album.Get this disc, take off your shoes, crack open a cold one and boogie down southern style.

B000000W5N|5.0|and I 've been listening to it since it was released in '71. Great tunes start to finish, from a time when the Stones were young, vital and peaking. The addition of Mick Taylor to the band at this time seems to have jazzed them up a little(new blood) and the songs show it.\\"Brown Sugar\\", \\"Wild Horses\\", \\"Bitch\\", \\"Moonlight Mile\\" and my personal favorite on this disc-- \\"Sway\\"--,are all fantastic songs I never tire of hearing.Even the downer on this album--\\"Sister Morphine\\"--is still a great listen(and I love playing it on my guitar).Absolutely one of the five best rock albums of the '70's.

They canceled it on me and said nothing...I waited and waited and thought it got lost in the mail, then tried tracking it and found it hadn't been sent because the one they had got damaged.  No one told me though.  They had even refunded my money without a word to me.  I reordered it from the actual Amazon as a new product and had it in 2 business days.  I'd say if you're going to buy something...just buy it from Amazon's wharehouse, it's safer.
B000XTLUW0|5.0|There are many factors to take into consideration when reviewing a live album: the setlist, the response of the crowd, the performance itself.  The fact that this is a live album made by Muse makes it even harder, dude to the arena quality of every one of their records since Origin of Symmetry.<br /><br />To begin, let's clarify the concept behind the title. HAARP is the acronym for the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program, a US military-funded project in Alaska concerned with beaming high-frequency radio waves into the ionosphere. The controversy over such project is obvious for the effects it could have not only over other countries but on humans as well. And if you have paid attention to the pattern of Muse's recent lyrics, we can easily tie this up as one more link in the chain.<br /><br />It is also worth mentioning that the setlist varies for both the music disc and the video disc. Which makes it the more satisfying when watching the DVD because it is not a mere repetition of the CD.<br /><br />Thirdly, the setlist. It is basically the same they used throughout the whole tour to promote Black Holes and Revelations. Something that could have been improved for the two historic Wembeley gigs. Here is where the slight disappointment shows: there are two unforgivable omissions that should have been included as higlights of their capacity to move a large audience into submisssion(Sing for absolution and Bliss). Also surprising is the decision to open this tour with a track created in its entirety to close with a bang (Knights of Cydonia), and rather close it with an obvious opener (Take a bow).<br /><br />The real climax of this live recording is not in the bombastic noise of Hysteria or Stockholm Syndrome, but in the resurrection of a song many of us have only dreamed of hearing performed live: Uninenteded. If it's true that they sacrificed oldies like Sunburn and Muscle museum, fans favorite in eveyr tour, the inclusion of an almost aocustic segment is one thing that most of us appreciate as a proof that their power lies not merely on the hard sound but mainly in Matt's incomparable voice.<br /><br />Made to enjoy from beginning to end, HAARP is one live recording everyone should own.ate as a proof that their power lies not merely on the hard sound but mainly in Matt's incomparable voice.

His writing is so very clear to me and his ideas are very powerful. I know it is true when he says he is not writing for us to believe his ideas. He is telling us ideas that we already know but have forgotten. Therein lies the power. Highly recommended for expanding consciousness.
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|Texas boogie is the best way to describe this album (their best album) and this is the style I love them in.I never came to terms with their 80's persona and I never thought that they should have abandoned the trademark style that endeared them to so many of us in the 70's.Songs like \\"La Grange\\", \\"Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers\\", \\"Hot, Blue and Righteous\\", \\"Precious and Grace\\", \\"Master of Sparks\\" and \\"Move Me On Down The Line\\" put their 80's work to shame.The days of cowboy hats and rhinestone suits beat the days of long beards hands down.Get this album(along with \\"Rio Grande Mud\\", \\"Fandango\\" and \\"Tejas\\") and boogie to your hearts content.

1563890410|5.0|This is my favorite comic book story. I was already a Gaiman fan, having read \\"Good Omens\\". But the intense intelligence and respect for the form of mythology in particular and story-telling in general, not to mention one of the all time great jumping off points (Lucifer's abdication of Hell), create a story that is breathtaking in it's scope and imagination.<br />AMAZING!<br />And I haven't even mentioned the stunning artwork, just beautiful, iconic and evocative.<br />All the \\"old gods\\" are represented and much intrigue and deal-brokering ensue.<br />These themes (the meaning and relevance of mythology) are further explored in at least 2 of his subsequent novels and many of his short stories.<br />This is still the definitive statement. Check it out, you will not be disappointed!

B000XTLUW0|5.0|This is quite simply the best piece of music and footage of a live band I have ever purchased. Muse electrifies the viewer on this dvd with their insane visualizations, awesome live music (which in my opinion is better then their recordings, nothing to take from the recordings though) and Matt Bellamy's insane musicianship with his guitar, or if you will many guitars. If you like Muse, you'll love this dvd. If you've never heard of Muse, this is the cd and dvd set to introduce yourself to them. This is a must buy.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|The Illusionist features excellent performances by Edward Norton as Eisenheim, Paul Giamatti as the Chief Police Inspector, and Rufus Sewell as the evil Crown Prince Leopold.  The leads play off each other to extraordinary effect.  The plot is brilliant, and fascinating.  I was also very impressed with Jessica Biel who was radiant in the movie.  A supernatural feel permeates the film as Eisenheim captures audiences with his baffling \\"tricks.\\"<br /><br />There has been much said about the fact that The Illusionist was released around the same time (it was released first) as [[ASIN:B000LC55F2 The Prestige]]; however, having enjoyed both films very much, I give the nod to this film.  I was very entertained and thought the time spent watching this movie was worth it.  The turn of the century Vienna scenery was visually pleasing. Edward Norton continues to be one of the finest actors in the industry.<br /><br />I highly recommend this five star movie.

I recommend this book to anyone searching for answers about the problems we face today.
0452289963|5.0|This book can save a life! It is a combination of Twelve Step Programs, A Course in Miracles, and A Return to Love. It is a concise view of all that I believe.It taught me HOW to apply the principles I find valuable. This book teaches a person to see themselves thru their own eyes, rather than what other people think. It teaches NOT to label people, because that is judgemental. I thank Oprah Winfrey for sharing this book with the world.My search for inner peace in one small book. Understandable,not confusing.
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|Too bad our current congress can not remember what was intended for all Americans. In this case, copy right protection. Microsoft ought to show clips from this movie.   I hope the new Ann Rand movie \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" stays true to form. Angelina Jolie has a habit of taking important issues left. More than ever, we need the real Ann Rand \\"Atlas Shrugged\\". Especially the Americans leaning to the left.
B00068TJM6|5.0|Finely crafted, hard to take your eyes off of.  Smoooooth second hand. Movement is nearly silent.  Excellent glow-in-the-dark hands and hour markers.  Moveable bezel is nicely damped so it stays where you put it.  Screw down crowns are a welcome feature.  Nice band with excellent double-lock clasp - easy to operate.  Deep coliseum face gives a nice 3-D effect.  You'll need good eyesight if you intend on using the slide-rule features.  The watch face is smaller than I expected, but is by no means too small.  It is probably about as close to the perfect size that you could ask for.  Watch isn't terribly heavy, but feels and looks sturdily built.  Should last me many years with the proper care.  The price for this watch is really quite amazing when you consider that it cost this much or more many years ago.  Can't see where they have cut corners to keep the price artificially low.  Seiko reminds me a lot of Honda or Toyota -- a great deal of pride in their products.  AND IT SHOWS!  One of those far-too-infrequent occasions where you actually get what you pay for.  This watch will most likely out-last and out-perform four or five $100 watches.  Rest assured you will receive compliments on this watch.  Kinda makes you want to wear short sleeves even in the middle of Winter.
B0010V4TZU|5.0|In this day of single downloads it is a wonderful surprise to find these new artists. Their debut album delivers several quality tracks, and like albums of old even the filler songs make listening to the whole album very enjoyable. My personal faves A-Punk, and Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa, show a depth of both musical talent, and intelligence. Give them a listen on You tube, then decide. I wasn't disappointed.
B000P12LWY|5.0|I was lucky to purchase this series at such a Great Price prior to the increase...

B000V86OKG|5.0|I didn't think the second season of \\"Dexter\\" could even come close to to the brilliance of the first season, but I was wrong. Instead of the Ice Truck Killer, Season 2 begins with the Miami P.D. hot on the trail of another mass-murderer dubbed as the Bay Harbor Butcher. Dexter (Michael C. Hall) already knows the identity of the killer right off the bat, because it happens to be him. The FBI is brought in to help investigate the case, and Dexter is under pressure to stay off the radar and figure out how to get himself out of this huge mess.<br /><br />Season 2 introduces some great new characters, including Special Agent Lundy (Keith Carradine) and the mysterious Lila (Jaime Murray), a woman who interferes with Dexter's relationship with Rita (Julie Benz). Meanwhile, La Guerta (Lauren V&eacute;lez) pulls some very dirty tricks out of her hat in an effort to get her job back, and Dexter's relationship with Doakes (Erik King) escalates and is finally put to the ultimate test.<br /><br />There are some exciting twists and turns in Season 2, but everything wraps up very nicely at the end. I have no idea what will happen to Dexter in Season 3, but I can't wait to find out!
B000BKVQTS|4.0|The Brother's Grimm had great visual effects. I thought they were outstanding. It was a little too frightening for children under 12, I would say, but older children would love it. The characters are funny and the story definately holds your attention. Peter Stormare really makes this movie a good watch.
0312360266|5.0|Marked by P. C. Cast and Kristin Cast is a refreshing breath of fresh air. I absolutely loved every minute reading this book. If there had been books like this when I was a teen I would have gone bonkers and never come out of my room.<br /><br />Zoey Redbird is your stereo typical teen in almost every way. That is until the day she gets marked by the Tracker. A high school student with a football player for a boyfriend, plenty of friends and a car of her own, who could ask for more.<br /><br />Once Zoey gets marked she runs home hoping to be comforted by her mother only to find herself being closed up in her room. Mom and step-dad consider Zoey to be evil incarnate now and call on their religion to help out but Zoey wants nothing to do with this so escapes from her bedroom to run to her Grandma Redbird. Best thing she could have ever done.<br /><br />The story takes us from the realm of daytime and humans to the realm of nighttime and vampires. They actually have a school to help train vamps to become vamps and everything is so different that it takes some time to become adjusted. Who would've thought!!<br /><br />I love the take on the story and it's uniqueness of vampires origin's. It's not your usual \\"I'm Going to Suck Your Blood\\" type of story. Humans become vampires through a totally new and quite literally a \\"Zap You're It\\" way. Only one sex scene that I ran across makes this even more appealing.<br /><br />I give the authors major credit where credit is due bringing us such an inventive, enjoyable and page turning work of art that will be enjoyed by many, many more avid night loving readers. Five stars in my book for a delicious delight.
B00004U8JV|5.0|I'm a big fan of the Jurassic Park franchise.  Even though this movie was reviewed by the so-called \\"media experts\\" as not being as good as the first movie, I liked it very much.  Would recommend this movie to all.
B00008G7UF|5.0|Having spent my first 19 years in France, I cannot but marvel at the perfect portrayal given by Kevin Kline.  His character, seeming lack of values or purpose are so close to reality in the French culture.<br />Meg Ryan of course has only to play the avergae American arriving in Paris, and needs no coaching to appear the perfect rude, self-centered tourist.  Even the strange relationships between criminal and cop are displayed and must prove a true part of the romantic French culture.<br />A beautiful movie replete with great humour, picturesque panoramas and the most endearing human emotions!
0321544080|5.0|Lighting really makes or breaks a photograph. And this is a fantastic book on lighting. He goes over so many professional lighting techniques. Many of the photographs were shot in film, so he is really good. No photoshop in this boook.  He also writes about having fun photographing, something many aspiring photogs forget over time, getting too caught up in technicalities.  Buy it!
B000BT97AO|5.0|I put this one right next to The Dark Crystal and The Labyrinth.  While it lacks the fairy-like element of those two, it still holds the magical and abstract feeling that all good Henson productions have, and it's bursting with all the creativeness one would expect.  If you're into artsy flicks, this is one you shouldn't miss.
0618918248|2.0|I am an atheist, but I despise this book. His arguments are mostly sound, and are the same arguments that many atheist will offer (e.g. \\"you can't prove a negative and the positive side hasn't yet made its case\\" \\"if we accept that faith is a valid proof it becomes very interesting that most personal faith experiences are directly contradicted by other peoples' personal faith experiences\\").<br /><br />If all Dawkins were doing was repeating the oft-stated arguments, this book would be boring but at least not rude and crude. Sadly, Mister Dawkins goes on to use cockeyed and rude arguments from authority. \\"people who have the same sort of career as me (academics) and are from the same social class as me (upper class) and have the same accent as me (and I certainly don't speak with a Birmingham or Texas accent) are so obviously smarter than everybody else, and most people in those groups agree with my conclusions.\\" Dawkins' elitism, however, is horribly wrong. If we accept his argument that the opinions of \\"most academics\\" should be assumed to be unerringly right by everyone else, then we're forced to conclude that the Sun did indeed move around the Earth until sometime in the 17th Century when Galileo's ideas started to catch on, that until the twentieth century persons of African descent were not as intellectually capable as persons of European descent, and that indeed Natural Selection (Dawkin's own field of study) didn't play a role in the development and differentiation of the species until after the bulk of scientists started to accept the idea around the end of the 19th Century. Dawkins obviously would have derided and ignored the work of a particularly famous High School dropout that worked in the patent office in Berne Switzherland in 1902.<br /><br />That fact that Mister Dawkins is so disrespectful to regular people, and their ability to discern arguments and logic, sheds long shadows over his own credibility. This sort of pompous \\"I'm Mensa, how about you?\\" leaves the reader wishing that there was a deity he could pray to to get the bumbling self-aggrandizing idiot smited.<br /><br />Richard Dawkins, people are smarter than you give them credit for. Your arrogance is exactly why you are despised. I'm an atheist, who has argued his case among the very religious, but I have been treated with respect and dignity. Your reading that these people are disrespectful comes from the same arrogant place as Socrates's sense that the people of Athens were disrespectful to him (\\"well obviously a genius like me is doing you a favor by encouraging bright children of the well-to-do to overthrow the democracy and put philosopher kings such as ourselves in charge -- now why don't we all agree that I'm a genius and have the taxpayer put me up in a luxury suite in the Parthenon?\\").<br /><br />He also goes on to argue the moral superiority of atheists. I don't disagree that we (atheists) have exactly the same capacity for good and evil as those who are theists. But I think that Dawkins -- very fond of deriding Catholics for moral failings (note my ethnic background is Protestant and Jewish) -- ought to take some time out to look at how much the Vatican has done in recent decades to bring attention to human rights abuses by the governments of the USSR, North Korea, and the PRC. While the young democracy of Taiwan is continually pushed and pressured by Western \\"intellectuals\\" like Dawkins to bow to PRC authority, only a handful of nations (including the Vatican) recognize the right of the Taiwanese to govern themselves Democratically.r wishing that there was a deity he could pray to to get the bumbling self-aggrandizing idiot smited.

B000YMBBH0|5.0|This is a great set a movies! Awesome picture quality and the sound is fantastic.
B000OONTFU|5.0|Don't know when this is coming out on blu-ray so I'd recommend buying and HD-DVD player (going for well under $100) and picking up these classics cheap.  Yeah, HD-DVD is the next laserdisk, but there's a fire sale going on and the quality of high definition is incomparable to standard DVD on a HD tv.  Extras are ok, and it's nice to have everything in one place.  Watch the first movie again and see how groundbreaking it really was.  It stands the test of time.  The other two are all high-tech with self-indulgent plots.
1416914293|5.0|When asked about this novel, I keep saying I think it could be better than J.K. Rowling's infamous Harry Potter series.  It's true!  Even reviewers on the book's covers seem to agree.  Clare creates a novel that's so filled with action, drama, teenage angst and other things that you don't want to put it down.  (At least, I didn't!)     As the middle installment of a trilogy, I was afraid it would be boring and slow-going.  But it wasn't.  I was immediately sucked into after the first few pages, remember why I loved the first book, City of Bones, so much.      The book is filled with smaller storylines that wrap together to create the overall plot, but you won't be confused as you're reading it.  Everything does fall into place.      If you haven't checked out City of Bones yet, I highly recommend you do.  (It's not in paperback.)  It's definitely worth the read.  I keep recommending it to everyone!
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|This cd is good for adults not for kids.  This cd has some sexual content to it.  Other than that it is brits best album for adults.  I am a britney fan, But I also believe that there are things that children below the age of 16 should hear.
B0013BNY2Q|4.0|\\"Accelerate\\" stands alone having little to do with previous R.E.M. albums. The first 3 songs, \\"Living Well Is The Best Revenge\\", \\"Man Sized Wreath\\" and \\"Superserious Supernatural\\" are the best opening of any R.E.M. album. However, while \\"Murmur\\", \\"Life's Rich Pageant\\", \\"Document\\", \\"Out of Time\\" and \\"Automatic For The People\\" grow into 5 of the finest end-to-end albums ever recorded, \\"Accelerate\\" weakens. Only \\"Mr. Richards\\" followed the solid opening with vigor. The songs on \\"Accelerate\\" are catchy - and 1-2 more of these tunes will likely grow on me. As for performances, highlights are the return of Mike Mills background vocals which give R.E.M. its groove. Peter Buck's guitar work is as good as I've heard - I'd rank it with \\"Document\\" or \\"Green\\". Michael Stipe is in-and-out of shouting and singing mode - but he does have a great voice. The only real weakness of the album is the lyrics tend to be tedious, not so much what they say but just too many words fitting into a short space. Speaking of short, the album is only 35 minutes long - 2 or 3 slower songs (I won't name any past similarities because \\"Accelerate\\" is unique) would have been nice.     \\"Accelerate\\" is an original sounding album by a band who's been around for nearly 30 years. That's special! It's a good album with a great start and R.E.M.'s best attributes (Mills vocals and Buck's guitar) are awesome. Stipe is just a little too busy on this album.     As to ranking this with the past R.E.M. albums \\"Accelerate\\" is probably just behind the 5 I mentioned earlier and easily the best since \\"Automatic...\\". \\"Accelerate\\" should be terrific in concert. I look for a big year for R.E.M.
B00008WT49|4.0|Great album for easy listening.  Recording is good and SACD makes it better.    You have to be in the mood to listen to her.  Good for background music.  Again, she's not called s'Norah for nothing.
0374280967|5.0|I came across this book from one of BookBrowse's monthly newsletters about upcoming releases/recommendations and proceeded to suggest it to the Palmer Evening Book Group, then quickly purchased my own copy on Amazon.<br /><br />It's a novella, only about 120 pages long and I managed to finish it through the course of a single day (with work shoved between (:.) The basic premise of the story is that the Queen of England has recently discovered books and the joy of reading by way of a traveling library that is parked near the courtyard of the palace. She returns to the library every Wednesday until she becomes so fond of reading, she begins to explore other places (such as the London Public Library, and her own extensive collection). Throughout the Queen's newfound hobby, the royal household and her staff quickly become upset. She's no longer interested in her \\"duties\\" and has started arriving late to places (such as Parliment). The Queen often laments about her meetings, wishing instead she could be at home reading.<br /><br />By the end of the novella, the Queen has moved on from her love of reading to becoming a writer. She's well aware of how this will make her staff feel, so she keeps it hidden.<br /><br />The novella is fully of great one-liners and thoughts that really make you think. Bennett achieves great success in this novella, making you both laugh out loud and ponder the \\"causes\\" of reading.<br /><br />Definitely a recommendation. But be weary if you don't like to read \\"British\\" English.
0452287588|1.0|i found this book to be boring and a rehash of many books in this field of interest.  i have not received any enlightenment from it. maybe that is to come when i least expect it.  until then i do not recommend it. save your money.

0452289963|5.0|A New Earch was Oprah's Book Club selection and she has an ongoing class with this book.  Although I haven't finished reading this book, I'm reading as the class goes from chapter to chapter on Monday night, I find it a very enlighting book.  I do think it is a deep book that people will find very wonderful at certain parts pertain to your own life. I am sure that it is one that will be read over and over as those periods of your life are affected.    I would definitely recommend this book so your can re-read it whenever you need too.  After I read each chapter I am going back and will read the whole book at once.    Also thank you for having the book in stock as I couldn't find it locally when the class was beginning.  I received the book on Monday so it was great that I read the first chapter before the class.  Even with S&H it cost less than I would have paid if I had bought it at Books a Million (who didn't have the book), or other stores that didn't have it either.    I really appreciate that Amazon.com had the book and it was on sale.  I will consider buying other things from your store, especially if it is on sale!!!    Toni Osborn
B000WQW988|5.0|I know that Nevermind's the one that gets all the glory, but this has always been my favorite Nirvana release. The group's work is just as good in electric mode as it is in acoustic format, and sometimes even better - as much as I love \\"Come As You Are\\", \\"About a Girl\\" and \\"On a Plain\\" in their studio versions, I think they even get better in an acoustic setting. Plus where else are you gonna find treasures like the Meat Puppets set (those Kirkwood brothers can PLAY!), the totally screwed-up version of \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\", where he totally flubs the lyrics, their brilliant covers of \\"The Man Who Sold the World\\" (which I think is better than Bowie's original), the Vaselines' \\"Jesus Don't Want Me for a Sunbeam\\", with a great accordion (NOT an oxymoron, by the way), and one of my favorite Nirvana tunes, \\"Where Did You Sleep Last Night?\\", which has some CREEPY screaming at the end. Not to mention that version of \\"All Apologies\\"... even redundant, already acoustic tunes like \\"Dumb\\", \\"Polly\\", and \\"Something in the Way\\" are still amazing.<br />Of course, you can get all that on the CD, but here's some reason to buy the DVD. For one, the between-song banter is expanded upon, and unlike the usual between-song banter (which usually consists of the whole \\"Are you ready to ROCK? I can't hear you, over all the ROCK! Show me your SOUL, San Fransisco!\\"), is really funny. I especially like the little jokes they make at Lynyrd Skynyrd's expense when the Meat Puppet guys come on (nothing against Skynyrd, I just find that mumbled joke run-through of \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" funny, and the puns about \\"Free Bird\\" funnier). Plus the set - the candles and flowers - looks cool. And it's funny to hear the ridiculous songs people shout for near the coda.<br />This review wasn't very coherent, I know, but hey. I love this stuff so much, I can't even talk about it without turning into a rambling fanboy. Just buy it. If you like the band, you won't be disappointed.
B00005JLT5|5.0|Now THIS ... is a good film !!<br /><br />Having viewed many, many films typical of the era of madness, I put this one at or near the top. Why ??<br />Because it deals more with intelligence/dignity and the intangible human presence caught up in a world of madness - physical & mental.<br />The prerequisite violent killings & torture are there - but that sobering activity is simply among the presence - a part of - the thoughts, the existence of innocent, literary, sane humanity within this flic !! Indeed a refreshing change to address the era.<br /><br />Wonderful, reflective and very well done - all of it !!<br />Anyone who resides among those of us who continue to try to understand what drives the human psyche to extreme madness should not miss this great film !!
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Awesome, if you enjoyed the TV series you'll love \\"The Ark of Truth\\"  I hope to be seeing more of SG-1 on DVD.
B00005MP58|5.0|Sometimes I wonder how many times you can watch a movie and never get tired of it. I love this version the best,even better than the Greer Garson one. Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle were perfect for theses roles. I was sad when it ended just to watch it again and then read the book..Wonderful movie..
B000003TAW|5.0|This is a hell of a record - clear, concise, crisp, catchy power-pop, it's a small wonder it caught on the way it did. The ubiquitous single \\"Buddy Holly\\" is here, and its charmingly gawky lyrics, vocal hooks most bands would die for, and brilliant Happy Days video make it one of the best songs of the '90s. But the other singles - the nervy Hollywood send-up \\"Undone (the Sweater Song)\\" and the personal, bitter grunge song \\"Say It Ain't So\\" (which, thanks to its inclusion in the apparently difficult singing tutorial in Rock Band, has led to an inside joke amongst my friends: \\"I hate `Say It Ain't So'!\\") - are just as good, and there are a bunch of other churning guitar-pop gems for your pleasure (\\"My Name is Jonas\\", \\"No One Else\\", \\"The World Has Turned and Left Me\\", \\"Surf Wax America\\", with a bizarre drop-off in volume; \\"Holiday\\"), and the mercurial Rivers Cuomo (at least as strange as his name, given the infamous Harvard story) paints himself as the quintessential dork on \\"In the Garage\\", which makes it easy for me, another dork, to identify with even if I don't like KISS. The lengthy \\"Only in Dreams\\" totally throws off the momentum, but it's only one song and it's the last one besides. You know, they're right when they call this one of the best of the '90s. It really, really was.
B000006YMN|5.0|This is an excellent CD.  Agnetha seems to be at her best after a break of a few years.  Her vocal quality has not deteriorated at all since her Abba years, in fact her voice seems to have become richer, but is still every bit as recognisable as it ever was.  You can really hear Peter Cetera's production influence in most of the tracks, especially Let it Shine and of course the duet \\"I Wasn't the One Who Said Goodbye\\".  My personal favourite is \\"If you Need Somebody Tonight\\"; a classic love song if I ever heard one.  Even though this CD was recorded 21 years ago, it still stands up today as a fine piece of work.    If you like Agnetha and you like Peter Cetera, this CD is a must for you!
B000QUEQBI|5.0|I love heavy violent movies - lots of 'shoot 'em up'  Wahlberg (in SHooter) damn sure fills that like of those type movies.  Excellent written movie.  Excellent Revenge too.  Damn sure a MUST SEE!

B00005YW4H|4.0|Got this CD as a gift and I find it to be a consistent album with many songs that I enjoy. It is great mellow music for a car trip or relaxing at home over dinner. I think people will find other tracks to enjoy on it than just the couple of hits that came off the disc.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|The soundtrack to the film is a stand-alone experience; not having seen the film will not create difficulties.  Although you will get lost in the deep rich texture of the instruments and vocal harmonies, please listen to the words.  You will find nuggets of insight into how the world works.  And, if you are Irish or enjoy things Irish, yes, it is informed by Irish sensibilities.
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|This movie is probably my favorite movie of all time, and that's saying a lot due to the fact that I own no movies but this one and do not own a tv or even go to the movie theater ever. It is rare that you see such a well put together film that takes you into the agonized mind and thoughts of someone suffering from a psychotic disorder.  This is a definite must see and addition to your video collection.

B00139B39E|5.0|I even like thet remixes which usually I don't when bands do such a thing. And I am even pleased with the edit versions so now I can take this disc with me for Kareoke night and finally do some DT song with it. But this disc is also a great way to introduce the band to new and future fans to come.
B000000WJ4|5.0|Classic Johnny Winter at the top of his craft.  A must-have if your into Texas Guitar Boogie ala Billy Gibbons, SRV, & Albert King.  Several notable tunes on this album including Check Out Her Momma, Blue Christmas, & Boogie Real Low.  But really, there's not a throw away tune here.  Tight band, Great guitar riffs.
0307237702|4.0|I went out and purchased this book as I was mighty curious as to why the public seems to be so entranced by this enigma that is Barack Obama. I read it with an open mind; not pro Obama or anti. His ideas and ease of rhetoric are flowing throughout the pages. Barack seems to be a very opinionated person, he wouldn't be in politics if he wasn't. After giving this book a once over, I'd recommend it to anyone fence sitting, or even a conservative. Obama truly seems to be a once in a lifetime leader and excels at linguistics, good considering our current President has a tough time putting together a coherent sentence.[[ASIN:1432719297 Enemies Among Us]]
B0013FBS20|4.0|The empty NYC visual is amazing and looks so real.  The zombies were obviously computer generated.  It's like a professional did the graphics for one and a kid straight out of school did the other.    The movie is great.  Lots of action.  Lots of scares.  Good acting.  A little humor mixed in.  It would be 5/5 if it wasn't for those fake looking zombies which really took away from how scary the film could have been.
0521008433|5.0|This book surprised me greatly. I was familiar with the first edition of the book. When I bought the book I expected improvements in this second edition, but to my surprise the improvements were a lot more than I had expected. I highly recommend the book for any trainer or trainee.
B000002J0P|5.0|Crosby, Stills and Nash were a very successful soft/folk rock band in the late 60's and early 70's.  A band that mainly focused on the vocals that easily had their own distinct sound and style compared to other singers back then.  Artists like Seals and Crofts would go on to imitate that vocal style, and while I love them as well, there's nothing like the original Crosby, Stills and Nash lineup with their big classic album in the early days.      They are now considered an important part in the development of soft rock, and while the more mellow songs are quite tasty and rich, they can hold their own with the electric guitar too.  We can't forget they were a band created during a time that saw more experimentation than the world was probably ready for.  Rock and roll was all over the place, in terms of creativity and diversity.      I like the Byrds and Buffalo Springfield more (and of course Neil Young's solo career) but we can't deny the beauty and excellent songwriting of this album.  We just can't deny it.
B00000JCOV|5.0|exellent album with rap/metal thats real amazing I have'nt heard any rap/metal from matal groups besides limp bizkit and this one too bad but otherwise this album was great all their albums was serious but this is the only rap/metal that slipknot did their other two albums was plain metal but still hot. Iam just wondering win their fourth album is coming out i hope they did'nt break up.
B00006ZXSK|4.0|This thing took forever to arrive.  I got it the very last possible day they provided for and on top that, it didn't even ship for about a week.  I was very disappointed.  The movie is good though.  If you like moderate chick flics this is for you.  You can get your girlfriend to watch it and it isn't painful for the boyfriend either.
0743270754|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin's Team Of Rivals: The Political Genius Of Abraham Lincoln is, on it's face, an ambitious undertaking.    Not only does it tell the story of America's 16th President, it also tells the story of the men who were his main political rivals for the Republican nomination in 1860 and later became the core of a cabinet that was forced to deal with the greatest political crisis in American history -- William Seward, Salmon Chase, Edwin Stanton, and Edward Bates. Unlike other Civil War-era histories that focus on battles, or on the story of Lincoln himself, Goodwin focuses on the politics of the era and the manner in which Lincoln was able to successfully navigate the political rivalries among his chief advisers and navigate the nation through a crisis that threatened it's very existence.    In taking this focus, Goodwin gives us a new perspective on a war that has garnered more research then any other in American history. Outside of focusing on the political impact of First Bull Run, the failed Peninsula Campaign, Antietam, and the twin victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg in July 1863, scant attention paid to events on the various battlefields of the war. Instead, we see Lincoln navigating the political battles taking place in Washington, often between his cabinet members and, in one case, involving a cabinet member who was openly planning a nomination challenge to him in 1864. Time after time, Goodwin demonstrates, Lincoln's deft, though underestimated, political skills allowed him to solve problems that other President's might have allowed to fester.    Throughout it all, Goodwin shows, Lincoln never lost faith in the rightness of the cause that he was elected to lead, or of the inevitability if it's ultimate triumph, even if that triumph took four years to occur. More importantly, though, Goodwin shows us just how a man who had no formal school and, only ten years before coming President, was essentially a back-country lawyer riding the circuit in Illinois was able to ascend to the highest office in the land at the nation's most crucial moment.    At over 900 pages, this is not a light read, but if you're interested in the era and the man, Goodwin's book is essential reading.

B0013D8LOU|5.0|I love musicals but \\"Sweeney Todd\\" has never been one of my Sondheim favorites up to this point. I haven't the opportunity to see it performed and only have listened to two different Broadway cast recordings of the musical (I must admit, before going any further, that seeing a performance makes a big difference with some musicals). I finished watching this movie a few hours ago and already I want to see it again. I've always enjoyed Johnny Depp as an actor and find him so very versatile. His role as Todd illustrates his brillance as an actor, more so than any other movie he's starred in.  Helena Bonham Carter was perfect as Mrs. Lovitt and Tim Burton was a genius choice to put this together.  Normally, I'm a big squemish with gore and I was so enjoying the film that I didn't look away as I ususally do!
0553381407|5.0|This was recommended by my therapist and was really helpful for me. I lent it to a friend and she found it helpful as well. In order for it to work, you have to be willing to follow its suggestions. Good recommendation and good book.
B00168HAOO|1.0|Here is how the movie goes,  First 30min or so videocam of some couples daily life....  Next 30min hint of some monster attack.....  Last 30min or so running for their life...  WARNING: all the above are shot thru the viewpoint of a viewcam with EXTREME jerking of the scene. Worse than any amateur or even kid shooting a home video. You feel nausea & eyes gets strains.I think those idiots cameraman deliberately shake the camera...in the name of artistic ?     Hence my experience for 1st 30min was extreme boredom & eyes strains, looking at some irrelevant home video ?  Next 30min nausea kicks in as more & more jerky scenes.Your eyes must be both closed now to avoid further abuse.  Last 30min,jerking continues, many peoples already left the movie hall. I sat thru with eyes closed as feeling too nausea & sick to leave.  Finally when shows ends only me & 2 couples left. Thanks god the torture is over.    Cannot understand why anyone would find this film ok, artistic, 4 stars , blah blah blah. This film should get negative 5 stars & rated T for torture.    The WORST movie in my viewing history. RIPOFF, THRASH !  This thrash should NOT be called a movie.  Utter waste of resources & viewers time.  See at your health's risk.
B000TGJ8CQ|2.0|Great idea and concept but what an appalling movie. Lost all credibility (not that it had much in the first place) when Nicolas cage clones / replicates himself......... the ending just belies belief and you think why on earth you have sat through the last hour of utter drivel only for it to come to such an abrupt and implausible close. Clearly the producers lost interest and whoever edited it must have been on LSD. I suppose if you are brain dead and have nothing else to do on a cold / wet Spring day in NJ it might be something to put on as it works better than Ambien at inducing a deep coma.

B000UNYJV8|5.0|I know several men who grew up in England in the 70s and 80s and they say that this movie is spot on! It is a great coming-of-age tale and is so well-done: not too sappy, not too melodramatic; just real and heart-wrenching. The kid, Thomas Turgoose, is phenomenal! I can't wait to see more movies with him in them. The choices this poor lad must face are very realistic and will make you think about war, race, class, and the absolute agony of adolescence. This is not to be missed! Anyone with a heart and a brain that works needs to see this movie.

B000P0J024|5.0|Music lovers would rightfully expect some pretty awesome songs to be written and performed by a group consisting of George Harrison, Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, and Bob Dylan, but, I dare say, no one could have anticipated the treasure that these superstar musicians created.  No, not even George, Tom, Jeff, Roy, and Bob themselves had an inkling that they would achieve what they did.<br /><br />The story of how these recording industry giants came together to form the \\"Traveling Wilburys\\" is as amazing as the music they produced.  These guys were all friends, and when George Harrison needed to come up with a song for the flip side of a new single of his that was about to be released called \\"This Is Love,\\" he acted more or less on a whim and asked his friends to collaborate with him to come up with a song that could be used for that purpose.  What they came up with was the song \\"Handle With Care,\\" and it was way too good to be a \\"B\\" side.<br /><br />This was the birth of \\"The Traveling Wiburys.\\"  Their story, as told by the Wilburys themselves, is included on a DVD in this set, and it is just about as entertaining as the music.<br /><br />Because of the success with their first song, and because of the fun they had in recording it, George asked the others if they would like to make an album.  They agreed, and in only ten days in May of 1988 they came up with the ten songs of their first album.<br /><br />The spontaneity of their collaboration is plainly felt as one listens to their music.  It was magic from Day One.<br /><br />My two favorite songs are \\"Handle With Care\\" and \\"End of the Line.\\"  I love the videos, too, especially the \\"End of the Line\\" video.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this 2 CD, 1 DVD set strongly enough!  It is unimaginable to me that anyone who likes the music of each of these performers individually would not absolutely love the songs of the Wilburys.<br /><br />This one is a \\"must have!\\"<br /><br />Tom<br /><br />P.S.<br /><br />It is sad that George Harrison and Roy Orbison have passed away.  May God rest your souls, George and Roy. Thank you for the great music you left us.uls, George and Roy. Thank you for the great music you left us.

0312379293|5.0|The Count of Monte Cristo meets the 21st Century  Absolutely superb mystery.  5+ stars.  One of the best books I've read in the last couple of years.  From the first page to the last word, Jeffrey Archer keeps the reader involved and on the edge of one's seat. There is never a dull moment yet the entire story is intellectually stimulating as Mr. Archer builds the novel to numerous crescendos of thrilling excitement.  Within the central premise of a man done wrong by the system, there are several stories within stories that ultimately build to a thundering climax with just a single word!  Without a doubt this wonderful novel will become a classic.    Basically, Mr. Archer tells the story of a simple yet humble man, Danny Cartwright,  caught in the wrong place at the wrong time who is force to endure being wronged by the English judicial system.  It is a story of never giving up and believing in one's self and the ultimate triumph of the \\"system\\".  Luck plays a dramatic part as Danny ends up in prison for the murder of his best friend that he did not commit, but fortunately, he is put in a cell with two cashiered British Army soldiers who take Danny under their thoughtful and protective wings.  From there the story takes off along the storyline of Alexandre Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo, except updated for today.  Absolutely a terrific story.  Mr. Archer takes a difficult thesis that could easily become a caricature of itself and weaves an incredible contemporary tale of intrigue and suspense.  Is it believable?  That's the beauty of the tale, because as it evolves it becomes more and more believable.  Rather than go off the deep end and stretch the credulity of the reader, Mr. Archer pays attention to details which makes the story both readable and believable.  There is so much going on that it is difficult to tell all here, but, believe me when I say that Mr. Archer keeps it all in believable perspective.  An absolutely delicious story.  The best character development I have read in quite awhile.  The story hinges on the characters although there is plenty of subtle action and intellectual twists.  Mr. Archer more than makes his characters believable which is the fundamental basis for this stunning novel.  A classic example of how to properly use character development successfully.  Should be used in a college literature course to demonstrate the importance of good character development and interaction.  This book will  become a classic.  Absolute must read.  In my estimation this is Jeffery Archer's masterpiece.  I read the book in several days so be ready because you won't be able to put it down.  500 pages.  Thank you Jeffrey Archer.  Looking forward to your next book.
0385338724|5.0|This book is about a woman who loses her memory and has no recolocition of the last 3 years. She has to struggle with learning who she has become in the last 3 years. This was a very good book! I just love all of Sophia Kinsella's books she is a very talented writer.
1400049628|4.0|Grabbed this just for fun as a break from non-fiction for the holidays. It IS fun and very informative, great info for people who do not ever consider themselves survivalists but one day may appreciate that \\"blades don't need reloading\\". You will start to matter of factly think Zombies are real as you go through this book. If you want a even creepier angle to read this from, try imagining  your closest slum without food for a month on the march and headed for you.  Get a copy for your \\"out there\\" friends and your \\"uptight\\" friends as well, odds are they will have a fun read also. Not for kids,or the zombies in our living world but worth a try for anyone else.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|picture and sound clarity was awesome allowing us to sit up close and really get into the visual experience of what is one of the genre's classic movies. The restored footage fills out the story perfectly without bloating it and I can see why RS says this is the version he intended to make. Highly recommended if you're a fan of the film.
B00133KFGW|2.0|It's not like movies need to be 100% realistic and the fact is either you dig this type of fantasy or you don't. It's just hard to swallow August's Dad running +/- 23 blocks in half a song and ending up exactly 5 spots from his long lost love in crowd of thousands; August composing a whole concert in about 3 days; both his parents looking more like his older siblings; characters miraculous meeting around NYC as if it consisted of 2 square blocks and the insufferable Robin Williams yet again at his very worst.  A must miss !
B0000VCZK2|5.0|As far as quadrilogies go...are there any other quadrilogies?  Whatever.  As far as quadrilogies go...is that even a word...?  I don't know.    What I know is, this collection has everything you could possibly want in a compendium, and I mean that as spelled out by the #3 definition of the word located on dictionary.com.      Seriously, you can spend hours watching stuff about all the movies without even watching the movies.  The drama behind and history of the original Aliens was probably more compelling than the fourth film in the series.  \\"Who actually wrote it?  Who then put their own spin on it?  Who's not talking to whom anymore?  Did HR Giger really offer opium to Ridley Scott the first time they met?\\"    I'm telling you, the back story is better than most of the third and fourth film.  But hey, I'm a sci-fi geek, in the least obsessive definition of the term, and I love all the movies.  And I REALLY love this quadrilogy.  If you have any DVD collection self-respect, you'll make darn sure you own this.
B000007SIN|5.0|A must have for any Steely Dan fan with a home theater speaker setup.    The skill with which this was mixed into 5 channels is bar-setting.  Sitting in my listening room and hearing background horn sections and vocal harmonies textured into the surround speakers is an amazing experience.  It makes a huge difference as compared to the wall of sound that comes from 2 speakers.  What's really cool is that if a vocalist or horn player has a part among the background texture that is meant to stand out a little (maybe just a vocalist throwing in a quick diva lick), that part is mixed into the mains so that it stands out a little more.  You've got to hear it on a good system to believe.    I jumped through some hoops to get my HTPC to work with DVD-Audio, which has become a bit of an obscure format.  It was WELL worth the effort.
B000ZLFALS|5.0|The Movie:  Visually-stunning, aurally-satisfying, uplifting, in and out of the theaters before I could catch it on the Big Screen. I rented it because the trailers had been so intriguing and I have the whole life-experience-associated-with-the-music thing going on. As soon as it was over, I pulled up Amazon to order it. The experience is so visceral, textual description can't even begin to do it justice. Spot-on casting, delightful choreography, inspired art direction, powerful performances...the list goes on. Joe Cocker in a triple role doing Come Together as only he can. The amazing Eddie Izzard doing For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite (several different ways!! -- gotta love Special Features) is LOL-funny and another of the mesmerizing visual interpretations Julie Taymor and company have created of these songs. Blu-ray was invented for this movie and, if you don't already have one, this is sufficient incentive to get a large flat-screen.    The Music:  Each of the songs is beautiful by itself and, for many, iconic and, as blasphemous as it may sound to some, I found the movie versions of a number of them BETTER than the Beatles' originals. Get the movie and/or the soundtrack and judge for yourself. You will probably find yourself fortunate enough to have one or more of these songs running through your head for some time -- enjoy it.
6305922756|4.0|this was an awesome flick. if you like dry brittish humor with a bunch of rock and roll mixed in you will love this movie.
B00005Q4CS|4.0|My family has made this film a Christmas tradition for the last few years.  This ranks up there with A Christmas Story, It's a Wonderful Life, and A Clockwork Orange as far as holiday films go.  \\"Requiem\\" is one the whole clan can enjoy, from toddlers to grandparents.  This movie will really leave you feeling happy and warm.  Ultimately, it's a tale of the triumph of the human spirit.
B00006CXSS|3.0|Love the series but one of the DVDs came with subtle marks/scratches and it does not play well.  Difficult to return only 1 bad one out of the set.
0452287588|5.0|This was a great book to read for someone that is already on a journey for spiritual enlightment. I can understand how some people may not be able to understand this book, because a few years ago I know I would've gotten pass the first few pages.  But I would challenge everyone to read the book, if you don't get it right away, read it again.  A New Earth begans with you understanding yourself, your action, feeling and spirit.
B000YABYLA|5.0|Juno is one of the most talked about movies of the year, hailed by some, scorned by others. I had the chance to watch it a couple of days ago. Sometimes I feel the need to write a review right away, other experiences compel me to stew over what I read or watched. Juno is a stew movie.<br /><br />For starters, I'm going to warn cautious parents of young teenagers and tweens to view it before letting their kids loose with Juno.  This film is a typical coming of age movie in that sexuality is a very strong theme. Several sexual comments, body part comments and situations that feel inappropriate and seem headed toward  a creepy place, pepper the film. There is no overt sexual activity, but there are scenes with clothing being removed and obviously naked, strategically placed persons. Though the cussing is less than I expected, some coarse comments are made in some unexpected scenes. I believe the f-bomb appeared once as a non-verbal and once as a verbal. There are other smatterings of language that are pretty low-key. The screenwriters apparently believe the statement...\\"cussing shows you lack creativity.\\"<br /><br />That said, I can now tell you what I loved about the film. The characters are quirky, engaging and people I would likely grow to call friends. Juno plays fragile/tough/transparent and naive all in the typical adolescent roller coaster. She's creative, cynical and fresh.  I loved Juno's sarcastic, dry dad and her off-the-wall stepmother. The family, dysfunctional in a loving and bizarrely respectful way, works and radiates a borderline healthy relationship. Juno's confidence and convictions are innocent and sweet and make her character multi-dimensional in all the right ways. Her support system is a delight to watch as they help her through things that are, as stated by Juno, way beyond her maturity level.<br /><br />Juno's opening credits are creative, a blend of reality and animation that gives a hint that the filmmakers will deliver a visually satisfying film. They do. The dialogue is fabulous. Fans of Napoleon Dynamite might want to check out this meatier, edgier slice of cinema. Fans of Dan in Real Life will probably find much to like in the characters interactions. If you like to laugh and tear up within the same movie, check out Juno.ialogue is fabulous.
