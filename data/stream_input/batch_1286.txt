B00074CBIS|4.0|Just by looking at the front cover, I can see Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon pretending to be Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan on the Rush Hour movie series. However, I have not seen this movie for years. I am so glad that I ordered the DVD. I love the part especially with model Gisele Bundchen touching that other woman (Jennifer Esposito) inappropriately.
0385535139|5.0|Oscar Finley and Wally Figg are two ambulance chasing lawyers who have managed to continue practicing law for decades by the skin of their teeth. Between problems with alcohol and women the highlight of their days have been when their office dog AC becomes alert and then starts to growl seconds before a siren is heard. AC stands for \\"AMBULANCE CHASER\\" and that about sums up the whole M.O. of the legal firm of Finley & Figg. Throw in Rochelle Gibson who answers phones when she's in the mood... and referees arguments between Oscar and Wally... and the reader immediately is aware that this firm isn't dripping with culture as it advertises on bingo cards among other venues.<br /><br />Despite the overly depressive surroundings and history... Wally continues to dream... not unlike Willy Loman in \\"Death Of A Salesman\\"... Wally constantly dreams of a giant multi-multi-million... hundreds of millions of dollars... class action lawsuits against a giant company with deep pockets. Before you know it Wally has put a name on the pot of gold of his dreams... Krayoxx a drug to lower the cholesterol of obese people. \\"Krayoxx was made by Varrick Labs, a New Jersey firm currently number three on Big Pharma's list of the world's ten largest drug companies, annual sales of some $25 billion, and a long, ugly history of bruising battles with federal regulators and tort lawyers.\\"<br /><br />Part of Wally's impossible dream... was lining up hundreds if not thousands of clients and simply riding into the promised land on the coattails of the experienced... private jet owning... renowned tort lawyers... that he envied so much.<br /><br />In the midst of this continually dismal \\"boutique\\" of a law firm's existence... David Zinc a thirty-one-year-old Harvard Graduate lawyer who is sick and tired of working for a giant prestigious law firm with no humanity... walks out on his \\"high-rise\\" firm and winds up on Finley & Figg's front door at the tail end of a kamikaze... drunken... one day binge. Though not a very logical landing spot for a Harvard Graduate making $300,000.00 a year without ever trying a case in court... the jagged serendipitous character melting pot that follows is the crux of the story. David watches in amazement as Wally promises cash kick backs for client references in the Krayoxx case... as well as promising millions of dollars in payoffs. All the while Wally's dream is to simply collect the money as the big boy tort all-stars do the dirty work in court. Without giving away the finish... to quote an old Bob Seger song: *SURROUNDED BY STRANGERS I THOUGHT WERE MY FRIENDS!\\"  The hilarity of the legal \\"THREE STOOGES\\" (Wally/Oscar/David) who between them did not have one day of trial experience in a Federal  Court... fighting  to simply survive as a business... let alone win a case... is the culmination  of an enjoyable character study.ng spot for a Harvard Graduate making $300,000.00 a year without ever trying a case in court... the jagged serendipitous character melting pot that follows is the crux of the story.

B005XY67WI|5.0|I bought this because a)Shakira is hot and b) I like her music. I have her other two concert videos, and so far, this one is my favorite. Its more high energy and eclectic and showcases a lot of the variety of music she's capable of singing. Her concert videos are all elaborate and have lots of great sets and outfits and lighting and sound. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a Shakira concert on blu-ray over the other two concerts she has out. Especially the one concert video with \\"Hips don't lie.\\" That one pretty much blows. The sound quality on it is not very good. This blu-ray has great sound, however.

0920668372|1.0|I happened to read this story one day at the store while Christmas shopping. Holy cow! What a G.D.mess this one is!!! This story honestly and literally gave me a really disturbed feeling. And I'm a 31 year old grown man. The cover looks innocent enough like any other kids book. But once inside, you find out just how bizarre and creepy this book really is. Just really, really weird. Disturbing would be the best word to describe it. I would NOT recommend this book to ANYONE, children OR adults, unless you hate them and want them to have nightmares.
038541627X|5.0|Isaac Asimov is a genius of science fiction.These stories provide the reader with many wonderful opportunities to think and even sympathize with the characters. Some of the stories deserve to be made into novels because they leave the reader wanting more, to know what became of their hero or villain.Certainly this anthology and it's sequel deserve to purchased and read because a genius wrote some of the most amazing stories that SF has ever seen.

0385493622|5.0|This book is a wonderful explanation of not only the history of Fermat's theorem but also it's subsequent solution. I am not a math major and certainly didn't understand the big deal with the theorem but this book helped increase and perhaps create an understanding of math that my teachers could only hope they cultivated in my youth.Though I don't expect to learn love math overnight, this book helps one see that math, just as every other subject, carries it's own history as rich as art and as wonderful as English literature.
0439023513|3.0|I absolutely loved the first book, had mixed feelings about the second book, and just recently finished up the third one as well. Unfortunately, I feel like the Hunger Games trilogy followed in the footsteps of many others before it, where the first is good, the second is okay, and the third feels lacking.  While I totally understand the author's goal, of making readers come away from the series thinking that war is bad, I found Mockingjay disappointing. I has read a few five-star reviews, and can understand the good points that others have pointed out in its defense, but I simply found Katniss too despondent, too drugged-up, and too weak to really make for a good read. She had her moments, yes, but this book in general was kind of hard to get through because it was sometimes a little boring and a little tedious.  The ending seemed extremely rushed, but it tied everything up adequately. All in all, I am glad that I was able to read Mockingjay, but it's not a book that I'd bother reading again.
1408803011|5.0|J.K. Rowling released a book containing inside information on the wizarding world, alongside Quidditch Through the Ages. This book, as the title states, focuses on the magical creatures we see throughout the Harry Potter series as he progresses through the years and comes into contact with more creatures.<br /><br />While reading the books, we, like Harry, come into contact with these creatures for the first time. Now, we are able to see his school book and read more information about these animals of which we, before, had only vague ideas.<br /><br />Not only does this book contain detailed explanations of what defines a \\"beast\\", but also tells us a bit about each creature in this book. From dragons to acromantulas; J.K. Rowling informs us of each of these creatures.<br /><br />Despite the informational text, a detail that breaks the textbook feel and adds humor is Harry and Ron's self-written notes throughout the book. From small discussions, to small snippets added to specific creatures - this book contains it all.<br /><br />It's these notes that made me go from a 4-star rating to 5, as it draws you into wizarding world and makes the entire world seem more realistic. Students scribbling in their books - isn't that a common occurrence, even for us muggles?<br /><br />It's relatable and that is what makes this book even better than with just the information it grants us.
B004SIPA4G|4.0|This version is incredible! I'm brazilian and I was very happy when I found that there's a portuguese version - menu, audio and subtitles - in the disc (in the back of the Blu-ray it isn't said). And more happy when I saw that the second disc, with the Recut, Extended and Unrated version, also has the portuguese audio option (with a new dubbing; the voice actor that used to dub Bruce Willis since \\"Moonlighting\\" died years ago). I prefer the original audio, but I like to have all the options. The R.E.U. version brings the stories separated, and the original version has 2 commentaries, one with Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller, and the other with Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. Also has the Cine-Explore option, with comparisons between the scene and the comics, and other stuff; and a cool audio version in 5.1 with an audience reaction recorded in Austin. Recommended!
B004G7FFF8|5.0|WHAT A FEAT!<br /><br />by jbongiornochi<br /><br />I have been followong Leslie Howard's complete-Liszt-piano-music project from afar for a number of years.  I assumed (always dangerous)he was a second-tier pianist trying to make a name for himself by attacking a humungous feat. His article in Wikipedea makes no mention of any activity in the United States, which was another strike against him.<br /><br />I was wrong.  His playing is world-clss technically and musically.  The quality is persistent throughout, with an unceasing elan.  You'd think he'd approach some of the music lackadaisically: \\"Ho hum, another thirty waltzes today.\\"  Not so, at least not in the samples I listened to.<br /><br />Okay, I figured, let's start with The Sonata.  As good as any I've heard.  The Beethoven-symphony transcriptions: better than any I've heard.  Opera paraphrases and transcriptions:  Superb.<br /><br />Comments on the opera works: such works were allegedly written for home use because so few poeple would afford to go to live performances.  If so, the amateur players at home must have beeen awfully talented, because it sounds like it would take players of Liszt's talent to play them.  Second, they are best listened a disc at a time, because there are only so many \\"frills\\" Liszt could use -- scales and cadensas in thirds and fifths, arpeggios, thundering bass (How often is bass not \\"thundering\\"?) -- and in time they can become tiresome, although through no fault of Howard's.  Many of them address operas by composers who have passed into the darkness of obscurity.<br /><br />He fantasized-paraphrased-transcribed other works of countless composers, not only of Beethoven, Liszt (yes, he transcribed his orchestral tone poems,Rossini, and Schubert and Schubert and Schubert -- nine-and-a-half CDs of Schubert alone -- and scores of others. There are more transcriptions and parpaphrases of others' work than there are original compositions of his own.  Again, I've never heard of many of the composers.<br /><br />His voicing is perfect: the melody is always there.<br /><br />Packaging is unsurpassed.  The big box is color-coded for the different types of music, and the contents of each CD are printed on each sleeve.<br /><br />Shop around.

B001VEHZZ2|5.0|Changez is the best Pakistan has to offer the world, brilliant, handsome, ambitious. Nothing can go wrong for him; he sprints through Princeton, best in his class, and easily obtains the best job in New York City and a beautiful American girlfriend. And then 9/11 happens and everything does go wrong.<br /><br />It's the way this story is written that is so wonderful. The Reluctant Fundamentalist is written with Changez speaking directly to an unidentified American in Pakistan, a conversation, a dialogue really, that extends the entire length of the book. It felt like Changez was talking directly to me, the reader, confiding in me the animosities, the hurts, the frustrations of those who grow up outside America's borders.<br /><br />Changez reveals the differences between himself, the outsider, and Americans. He tells us he has come to \\"savor the denial of gratification.\\" He is irritated with Americans and the \\"ease with which they spent money\\", their \\"self-righteousness\\". He admires his own ability to function both \\"respectfully and with self-respect,\\" something he sees Americans as unable to do. He resents Americans, who did not even exist as a people while his ancestors were building a rich civilization.<br /><br />And what an ending. It's been a long time since I read a book with such a powerful and satisfying ending.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I was extremely worried about reading this book after the mixed reviews.  I don't understand the high number of sub-3 star reviews.  Game of Thrones is an epic.  It is not the story of Tyrion, the Starks, or The Dragon princess alone.  To say the this book doesn't advance the plot is ludicrous.  It just doesn't advance the plot in an easy way.  There are a lot of layers of subtext.  Things happen that at first glance are superficial, but have great, and sometimes unspoken, importance.  Sure, I would love to read more about my favorite characters, but their story and point of views are not the only ones.  There are no throw away chapters here.

B0001LYH98|5.0|While I know this isn't Bowie's catchiest album, for  me it is emotionally, the one that has the most meaning.  I know at the time he put this out he said he was trying to make music for his generation instead of trying to cater to the usual pop main stream.  It is an album who's lyrics are filled with thoughtful ambiguity.  The musical style is quiet and ponderous, for the most part, supporting the same in the lyrics.<br /><br />Without going too far into  my own personal reasons for loving this album so much, I will say it is what I put in my cd player when I need to find my way out of a mental crisis. The lyrics are always giving me new meanings and as I grow older (I first bought this when it came out--which was my first year of college) I find myself coming closer and closer to the material that Bowie presented.<br /><br />This was my first David Bowie album and I've never regretted owning this.
B002BWP49C|5.0|While the first 3 Movies stayed somewhat close to the books, \\"Breaking Dawn-Part 1\\", has a lot of thing's that are different in it... I know that they can't put EVERYTHING from the book into the movie, but there were a few time's that I found myself thinking 'Why did they   do this/that???', 'How did they get from there to here???'  Even with those thing's, it's still a GREAT Movie... One that you diffently want to see... I just hope they release it on DVD soon... I also can't wait to see -Part 2-, I think it's going to be sometime in July or around then...

B005JE7WKI|4.0|Tucker (Alan Tudyk from Firefly) and Dale Tyler (Tyler Labine from Reaper) are two harmless hillbillies who buy a summer cabin, to enjoy some fishing. However, when they rescue Allison (Katrina Bowden) from drowning and take her back to their cabin, her college friends mistake them for the kind of crazy hicks you see in horror movies. One by one, the college kids are dieing while coming to the rescue, but because they are dumb and clumsy, not because Tucker and Dale are killing them.<br />  While watching the trailer, I wanted to see the film right away, but thought \\"how can they pull off a movie with teens just accidently killing themselves, through-out\\", but some how the film works and it's very funny. While Labine, who's from many canceled Tv shows, gives a star making performance and is just brilliant as a loveable hillbilly that wants a girlfriend, but doesn't know how to talk to the ladies. Tudyk, who's also usually from television has a natural chemistry with Labine and is pretty funny as well. The plot is clever, but it's the leads that mostly make the film work. In closing, the very end is kind of dumb, but not so dumb that it ruins the movie, so check the movie out!

B000HEWEJO|3.0|Bought this as a gift for my mother who love love loves this movie.  We had it for a long time on VHS.  I thought the one disc version would be fine.  It includes the updated restored black and white version of the film.  Although I would never watch this movie in color I would suggest just going for the 2 disc edition anyways.  In the 2 disc edition you can watch the un-restored black and white version of the film which I am told .  Summary:  Just shell out a couple bucks more for the 2 disc edition and it will be worth it.
0525423656|5.0|Ally Condie does it again. Her writing style is so lyrical and fluid, her storytelling so heartfelt and inspirational.  I think those reviewers who objected to the use of poetry actually reinforce one of the story's themes: people appreciate, value, and seek that which is denied them. Many of us live in societies where it's easy to take for granted the treasure troves of great poetry, literature, history, art, music, etc., readily available in libraries, museums, schools, stores, and online. If Cassia and Ky had our access to all of this, they probably wouldn't be so affected by centuries-old poetry either. But that's the point. Their circumstances, their struggles against the limited knowledge and freedom of the Society open them up to the shared human experience of these lines of verse that transcend time and place. Ally captures that concept in an amazing way, weaving it through the pages, making it a symbol of the characters' rebellion, and inviting the reader to be part of that connection too.  Crossed builds substantially on the foundation of Matched. We learn more about the main characters and the world. We meet interesting new characters and see interesting new places. Some mysteries resolve while others deepen. I did feel that Ky's and Cassia's \\"voices\\" weren't distinct enough and sometimes had to flip back to the chapter headings to figure out who was talking. But overall, the quality of the writing is awesome. I love the imagery and emotion of Ally's words, as well as the intrigue and premise of the story. I would like to know more about the Society, its leader(s), its motivations, its rationalizations, and its purpose. Why do they do what they do? Hopefully these questions will be addressed in the next installment.  This is an enjoyable, thought-provoking book...wish I could keep reading to the end right now instead of having to wait another year!

0307593312|5.0|Best book I have read in a long time! I am a skimmer, but with this book, it was difficult to skim because of the connections between the characters and all the different 84's. The constants were Tengo and Aomame and their connection over the period after their hand holding when ten. Everything else was changing and oscillating. They were great characters and I hope to read more about them in their new reality (possible new book)? The book conned me into buying music, Janacek which I liked a lot! I have a math background so Tengo's job experiences were pretty familiar, and I wonder if Murakami didn't have some math background?  Aomame is warned in the beginning \\"things are not what they seem,\\" and that certainly proves to be true! The Little People's enigmatic existence and behavior seems to be beyond the understanding of the author and is just there. They can talk to some people and create doubles of others, but do not have unlimited powers, and it is not clear they exist in the beginning and final realities. Angels or Demons or??  It is a great pitched battle between reality and fantasy by a master of both! I am totally hooked on Murakami!

They keep it real, and the camera work is just mind-blowing. This is by far the best action film I've seen in a long time. VERY INTELLEGINETLY DONE.
B002RSDW80|4.0|Before I saw the movie I listened to an Audio book of Julie Powell's Book.  It was interesting to me because I like to cook and my friends usually turn to me for cooking advice and look forward to anything I make.  I was, however.  a bit disturbed by her fowl language, even though I am younger than her.  I'd disagree with anyone who says that is how people talk these days - if that is how \\"they\\" talk \\"they \\" shouldn't speak or write for or to others.  Thankfully this language is basically completely missing from the film and Amy Adam's portrayal of Julie Powell is far more likeable than I imagine the real Powell is.  Unfortunately I have a hard time believing that she actually made all of the aspics or that honesty is important to her.  After all she didn't even ask her mom for Julia Child's cookbook - she stole it from her own mother.  After her book was published and before the movie came out she had an affair on her \\"sainted\\" husband and she seems to not appreciate her fans.  Probably the only part of the movie that resembles her true life is the part where she is self centered.  All of this of course is good because a movie based on the real Julie Powell would be boring and irritating.  Meryl Strep is amazing simply amazing - when you think of how different this character is from the \\"Devil\\" and from the equally opinionated nun she played in Doubt, it is truly incredible.  I would give this film 5 stars but, it isn't a movie that is going to have universal appeal.  It will mostly appeal to foodies and people who are already fans of Julia Child but for those who like it - they will really like it.  The Julia Child part is really a love story and a very touching one unlike the shame of a marriage Powell apparently has.

B001F3FUK6|1.0|I was looking through on sale movies and saw this movie had descent reviews.  For the life of me I cant figure out why.  This movie was incredibly slow for a drama, let alone a comic movie.  Lex Luthor's plan made less then no sense in this movie.  Superman can apparently lift a small planet made of kryptonite and fly with it?  Let's not forget the lightly veiled Jesus reference or the cliché of his son (Superboy?) who is constantly sick.  This comic movie ranks down with the 1994 Captain America, 1994 Fantastic Four or the 2003 Daredevil movie.
B000PMLFRA|3.0|This review is over the September 16, 2011 Blu-ray release (the box with vader's head covered in scenes from the movies). At the moment this is the only release of episodes 4-6 on blu-ray (the 1-6 is basically the same release). NOTE THAT THIS VERSION DOES NOT HAVE THE THEATRICAL RELEASE.  That All Caps aside, this is an excellent release.   PROS  - The blu-ray quality is excellent  - 3 disc set, in a small compact form  - Separate from episodes 1-3  CONS  - Doesn't contain the theatrical release  - blu-ray quality means that the CGI add-ons are easy to spot and look pretty bad IMO (even a person watching the series for the first time can tell these aren't suppose to be there)  - Cheap  Note: if you want the Theatrical Release (at the point of this review) you either need to get the old VHS or the November 4, 2008 DVD release (has vader and luke clashing with lightsabers, lots of blue, with vader's helm in the background) [[ASIN:B001EN71DG Star Wars Trilogy (Widescreen Theatrical Edition)]]

B000A0GP0Y|5.0|I bought this movie as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. I knew he loved the movie and wanted to add it to his rather large collection of DVDs because he kept repeating the phrase \\"Will you teach me to football?\\" every five minutes. The movie was only eight dollars and it arrived within two days thanks to Amazon Prime.  I don't usually watch football movies but he really wanted to watch it the moment he opened it. However, this movie was absolutely hilarious. It was definitely more of a comedy than anything. I think it's one of Adam Sandler's best!

B001AQO3QA|5.0|As everyone as mentioned the packaging is a bit difficult to get the discs in and out of. I am using the PS3 as my Bly-Ray player and having no issues.  I don't see the need to go into more detail on picture and audio quality there are many very in-depth reviews here expressing my thoughts. Great update, Great Picture and Sound.
B002ZG981E|3.0|I love this movie.  I just got a blu ray player, and a itouch so most of the blu rays I received as presents have the digital copy in it.  If you buy this movie just for the digital copy, don't bother.  It expired and you can't use it at all.  Maybe they should put something on the case that the digital copy expired in May.
B0064T6LV8|3.0|Minor bug: ball can get hung up on tiny flipper in wild west mini game. Still, great physics. Lots of fun to play repeatedly. Ads are annoying and too easy to launch by accident.  Game crashes at times. Considering all the ads I think all the boards should be included.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I love how the series turned out, the seventh part two with snape almost killed me haha, I watched that part over three times in a row! I don't regret buying this, if you want to wait, ok, wait. But I don't think it's such a big deal to wait. Anyway, good job everyone who worked on harry potter :D

B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is wonderful. The movements are world class no waiting dosen't freeze while playing. thanks for making such a great game.
B0036T32LQ|4.0|I flipped this on at about 1 am when I had way too much grading to do to work in silence.  To be honest, I wasn't expecting much except some white noise in the background, but I was pleasantly surprised when it was all said and done.  I did some research, and read that this was an Australian production, which is probably why I had never heard of it, even being a fan of B-style-horror movies.  It starts off fairly typically, to be honest I thought the first 30 minutes were so standard and typical, I almost turned it off.  However at about 40 minutes in, the movie 'felt' like it was about to end...45 minute movie? ...didn't make sense.  So it drew me in for that reason, and it was about the 45 minute mark (ish) that this movie takes a twist and just goes nuts from there on out.  I don't want to really reveal the plot point I am speaking of, but I've never seen a movie twist so hard and pick up at a fairly relentless, and at times slightly confusing, pace.  It turns from being what looks like a fairly stupid stranded/slasher movie to something totally different, and for the last half really plays with your head making you constantly question what is real and what isn't.  I thought the female lead does a great job at conveying this as well (it would SUCK to be in her shoes that's for sure).    So look, this isn't the greatest horror movie ever, but damn, it was surprisingly good.  By the end, it leaves you in the wake of such a twisty path, it has you thinking hard about the beginning again (thus redeeming its [seemingly] slow start).  I think any horror fan would enjoy this flick, it might not be the best ever, but I think it will surprise many of you.  By the way, I got jack graded that night, although it was worth it.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Really fun game, *extremely* addicting, and runs smoothly with absolutely no lag. Some people may complaining about the ads loading affecting performance, but I often play this when I don't have a WiFi connection, so there are no ads to worry about.
B004GGQMRY|5.0|I bought two copies of this Blu-Ray for Christmas gifts.  Both were flawless copies with great quality.  The movie is based on a true story (with some falsities added in).  The performances were entrancing.  Dustin Hoffman portrayed his character with perfection and even was able to mimic some of the smaller ticks beautifully!  Tom Cruise plays a terrific jerk who pulls it together and becomes the loving brother Raymond needs.  A real tear-jerker.  I highly recommend the movie and seller.
B006C45CFG|5.0|I'm a House fan so since Olivia Wilde was on that, I've been a fan so had to see the movie. I saw Cowboys and Aliens when it was in the theaters and thought it was really good. There were some parts I didn't like but saying which ones would be spoilers so I'll leave them out of my review.
B00006JDU9|5.0|This dvd made my collecton complete! I was very pleased at the expedition and quality of the item. Though the dvd has been out for some time it appeared \\"brand new\\".
B001MNFOIW|4.0|I was surprised at the ratings from others. I'm a Jolie fan so maybe I'm biased but I liked the film and thought it was good. I watched it when it was in theaters and have seen it many times since. I'm glad it's on sale right now on Amazon so I just bought it :)
B004XWMXX8|5.0|Ordered this for a Christmas gift.  It came in plenty of time.  Was much cheaper than in the store.  CD in new condition.
B006C1DH92|3.0|Love fruit ninja! It's free! This is the first time I've ever downloaded a game from Amazon.com. I'm pretty impressed at how many hoops I have to go brough to get this thing.
B005P06AAO|5.0|This show caught my attention when i first saw the trailer to it, after R.J. Berger has been cancelled, it was very hard for me to find another unique show. Later on Awkward. has been premiered. When I saw the first episode, I was in love, this shows is really awkward from wierd parent making sure their kids has the best in life, to school where you are pratically a loser because you are prettier than the 'b****y' head cheerleader. this show has an amazing cast, you have the counselor, trying to be young and hip and down with the kids, you have the 'obese' yet pretty cheerleader who thinks the world should hear what she says because everything out of her mouths is a compliment which ends in 'you're welcome', you have the parents, that is worried that their daughter is a loser, so they get her the nicest things and trys to be cool. you have the 'teen' who is in love with the awkward. girl but is still afraid of what people thinks, then you have the class president who wants the 'awkward.' girl but has a christian girl friend. when you watch this 13 episode season, you are going to love love love this show! i guarantee it... you're welcome.
B004ZNB12O|2.0|this is a ok cd ,I'm a huge fan of pink floyd but I'm disappoint at this compilation,you cant get the best of pink floyd on 1 cd,i will say you need at least 3 cds to get the best of it,the left out songs like mother,poles apart .on the turning away,good bye blue sky,one of these days ,a pillow of winds ,echoes just about the entire animals album and  wish you were here album..do you self a favor just get the box set its worth it or just get all the albums pink floys is not a band you can just put on a 12 song compilation

B0001E7LMU|5.0|Get the expansion, this game is a great deal of fun!  I played this game with 7 of my friends and we loved it! It was a classic mix of Mafia and your favorite board game.  Bought the Sabs 2 as well but you NEED the original the play 2.  Awesome game!
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Nice quality bag to hold your camera and all your accessories. It is a little bigger than I thought it would be but will come in handy as I add to my camera accessories.
B004U52VPS|4.0|Initial impressions are mixed. I love the concept but the implementation leaves a little to be desired. The game is a slight departure from the original. Still fun to play but not without a few problems. The pieces are much smaller and lighter than expected. Gameplay is a little off compared to the origial game. Aiming can be difficult but in reality, it's still a lot of fun if you enjoy the \\"destructive\\" nature of the angry birds we've all grown to love. Build it up and tear it down! My son loves it and I must admit, even with the few shortcomings listed above, I'd buy this product again.
B000002UAI|4.0|It is nice to see the predecessor to Rubber Soul display such a subtle switch in maturity and attitude from the smiling, wiggling moptops people were trying to write off back during their earlier output.  Considering this album was released the year I was born and having grown up in a household of 2 out of 3 siblings who preferred them to the likes of Bobby Sherman (don't ask), the matter of mono verses stereo isn't even an entity here.  Great music is great music, even if you have to get out your grandparents' old 78s to hear Glenn Miller the way he truly sounded.  The music will surpass the technology if it's truly great, and this is my argument with For Sale.<br /><br />Moodier than their earlier albums, one tends to rely on interviews with John Lennon from Beatle Brunch and other such Sunday morning radio shows for, not only how tired they appear on the album cover, but also their less than happy-go-lucky sound this time out.  I heard recordings of John explaining why the Beatles stopped touring and it was truly an eye opener.  To be in their position and have a bipolar reaction of love and hate to that magnitude would truly change your approach in the studio as well.  It shows a young group of brilliantly 20-somethings who were battling critical analysis by the press, blackmailings by wealthy politicians for favors to their kids, and teen idolization Lennon enjoyed least of all of them to show how grace still held under pressure once being hurried back into studio for a Christmas release.<br /><br />1. \\"No Reply:\\"  A bitter song about cheating with among the finest melodic structures in all of pop-dom to this day, it stands as one of their truly great pre-hippie tracks that doesn't detract appeal to the fans of their earlier catalog.<br /><br />2.  \\"I'm a Loser:\\"  Some self-deprecating reflection from Lennon?  Again, just like on the previous track, his voice is strong and emotive, and the song is an inarguable classic.  I still laugh about the parody of the song by the Mosquitos on Gilligan's Island, regardless of the fact they looked and sounded more like the Byrds.<br /><br />3.  \\"Baby's in Black:\\"  Gorgeous harmonies between Lennon and McCartney with a mid-tempo rhythm that gets you lazily bobbing to it without much thought.<br /><br />4.  \\"Rock and Roll Music:\\"  This has never been my favorite classic early rock song, but I don't understand what people have against the cover either.  It's certainly better than others I've heard, especially the vomit-inducing REO Speedwagon.<br /><br />5. \\"I'll Follow the Sun:\\"  Not quite as depressing as the above tracks, this is one of the finest and catchiest melodies to ever brace the Beatles songwriting catalog.  It's obviously typical McCartney, and it is the forefather of songs like \\"Lovely Linda\\" and \\"Junk.\\"<br /><br />6.  \\"Mr. Moonlight:\\"  Okay, so it's not that great, I agree.  Compared to crap like Cheap Trick, among their most awful imitators, though, this is a brilliant cover.<br /><br />7.  \\"Medley:  a) Kansas City/b) Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey:\\"  Great rockin' covers with road roughened bawlz.  This shows just what a great grasp they had on R&B as a covers group, and their own pop melodies never detracted from the fact that they never lost that grittiness even later.<br /><br />8.  \\"Eight Days a Week:\\"  Sorry, but this has never been my favorite Beatles song at all, but I don't dislike it either.  It sounds like it was written in a hurry, but to their credit, I would never have dreamed of a title like that.  Hell, it's even become a catch phrase!<br /><br />9.  \\"Words of Love:\\"  Interesting Buddy Holly cover.  It's Lennon and McCartney's harmonizing here that keep your attention forward and center.<br /><br />10.  \\"Honey Don't:\\"  They should have applied the title of this song as a response to the idea of letting Ringo sing lead on it.  He has his cute novelty moments, but this one just doesn't work.<br /><br />11.  \\"Every Little Thing:\\"  Outstanding!  Easily my favorite cut onthis album.  It's short, sweet, has upbeat lyrics and a sweet sentimentality that detracts from it's alleged datedness.  It is a truly magnificent, endearing timepiece that stands still in my book.<br /><br />12.  \\"I Don't Want to Spoil the Party:\\"  My second favorite track on FS, we used to play this song all the time on the stereo when I was little, and it brings back some really great memories.  A bit Everly Brothers-like, the harmonies are stellar and the simple, folk pop arrangement is also very sharp.<br /><br />13.  \\"What You're Doing:\\"  Great rocker.  Polar opposites in depressing and fun, featuring some of Paul's strongest lead vocals and great guitar work by George.  Ringo's puctuative drumming is also very striking on this one.<br /><br />14.  \\"Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby:\\"  Disappointingly standard cover, this one shows the boys were rushed to reach their deadline.  I wouldn't mind it so much if it weren't the last track on the disc.  It would have been better if they'd switched it with \\"I'll Follow the Sun,\\" so that the album could have had a very strong, positive ending cut.<br /><br />Minor flaws aside, this is a very good, strong Beatles effort that shows grace under pressure, and anyone who gives this album less than 4 stars isn't hearing what makes it so phenomenally great.  It is truly the beginning of a new sort of growth for a quartet of young men who probably matured a lot more quickly than they'd intended and, in their creative labor, we fans reaped the rewards.  Five decades later, it's obvious that the rewards of their efforts are very sweet indeed.It is a truly magnificent, endearing timepiece that stands still in my book.  12.  \\"I Don't Want to Spoil the Party:\\"  My second favorite track on FS, we used to play this song all the time on the stereo when I was little, and it brings back some really great memories.

0307591549|5.0|This is the kind of book you will want to give to someone you care about. Digestible research review for the layperson about what makes up happy written with Malcolm Gladwell-like comprehensibility.<br /><br />Early on, we're taught to get an education, find a job, work hard, be successful, and we'll find happiness. Turns out, like so many things, science and research say just the reverse. Figure out what makes you happy, pursue it, and you'll find happiness, and a good living to boot. Shawn Achor, a researcher and teacher himself, has pulled together the research of some of my favorite people--Martin Seligman, Carol Dwek, Tal Ben-Shahar--and many others into an enjoyable, powerful text which posits that intentionally investing in what makes us happy might just be the most important investment we make in our lives. He offers seven (7) principles to help us do just that. Principle #1: The Happiness Advantage--How Happiness Gives Your Brain and Your Organization the Competitive Edge; Principle #2: The Fulcrum and the Lever--Changing Your Performance by Changing Your Mindset; Principle #3: The Tetris Effect--Training Your Brain to Capitalize on Possibility; Principle #4: Falling Up--Capitalizing on the Downs to Create Upward Momentum; Principle #5: The Zorro Circle--How Limiting Your Focus to Small, Manageable Goals Can Expand Your Sphere of Power; Principle #6: The 20-Second Rule--How to Turn Bad Habits into Good Ones by Minimizing Barriers to Change; and, Principle #7: Social Investment--<br />Why Social Support is Your Single Greatest Asset. This book is VERY important for employees, teams, leaders and companies to read. Send a copy to someone you care about.
B004NELBPC|3.0|The app is OK except for the slide shows for any article shows the same unrelated pictures of celebrities at a premier, regardless of what the article is about.  This is too bad because they have a lot of Top 10 lists that they display as slide shows so you mis a lot of the content.  The rest of the app works fine.

B004A8ZWXS|2.0|I was hoping for so much more than this from Spielberg. It's basically the 1943 (?) movie of Lassie Come Home starring Roddy McDowell and Liz Taylor: Poor family has animal everyone wants, poor family has money problems, sells said animal to pay bills, said animal wants to come home, travels miles, meets up with many people who help it, finds owner in the end. End of Story! The Collie is merely changed into a horse. No doubt the serial copier/remakers of Hollywood will make the same story again with a cat or a bird or a gerbil. There are soooo many to choose from.  As far as equine technical advice, this movie was so incredibly unbelievable. Joey runs thru 2, count them, TWO, barbed wire fences, wrapped tightly from head to foot, yet when cut loose, not a drop of blood or a cut. Personally I've seen horses who have tangled with barbed wire. The wire wins! This animal would have been hamburger. There were no tetanus shots nor antibiotics in 1918 to my knowledge, certainly not on a battle field.  It was talky, a LOT of war, a whole lot less horse scenes than, say, \\"Horse Whisperer\\" which is still a superior horse movie.  I've lived 66 years and have come to the realization that war will NEVER end. Men must have their wars. I have nothing against soldiers, but everything against war. If there are no wars, men make them up and \\"play soldier\\" on the weekends. To quote from the movie, \\"Everyone loses everything in war.\\" To men I say: If you must kill each other please LEAVE THE ANIMALS OUT OF IT!! Spielberg is an anti-war liberal. Why is he so enamored with war?????  Only gave it 2 stars for the phenomenal cinematography.  Rent this one, don't waste your money.

1593081081|5.0|I got this book for free so I just read it to see what it was about. I am surprised to say Little Women is actually a very addicting book. All of the characters are fun to follow. The second group of stories are stronger than the first, but overall this is a great read.
B0060AY6FO|1.0|I'm not overly picky about P&P rehashes -- I don't care if the writing style is Jane Austen's, and I'm perfectly fine with authors taking liberties with characters (and I did enjoy the references to her other books sprinkled throughout).  I just could not get into this book, though, and I regret forcing myself to finish it.<br />First off, the two main characters (Darcy & Elizabeth) didn't play much of a role at all.  This wasn't a continuation of their story, but it wasn't really someone else's story, either.  It kind of wandered back and forth, never really going anywhere.  The potential was there, but it was more like the plot was just a series of events happening to one-dimensional characters, rather than them living the plot.<br />Second, Darcy is pretty much a wimp in this book, taking little to no action and continually second-guessing himself.  Pretty much the only time you see Darcy's point of view is when he's worrying about this, beating himself up over that, and wallowing in his insecurities.  Elizabeth seems to exist solely to worry about Darcy.<br />Third, and this is nit-picky, but the author has a habit of providing backstory by having characters discuss previous events (that both characters were party to and of which they are therefore fully aware) in excrutiating detail that is just too awkward for words.  It'd be like you telling your best friend how the two of you met, as if he/she wasn't there or couldn't remember.<br />Finally, this wasn't much of a mystery.  Sure, there was a murder, and people wondered what happened, but there was no detecting, no action, no developments.  It was all incredibly passive, and in the end the solution is wrapped up in a tidy little bow and presented to everyone.<br />Overall, if you're a mystery fan, this is a poorly-written mystery that completely lacks suspense or satisfaction.  If you're a P&P junkie and have read everything else out there and need your fix until the next book comes along, then this might hold you over.  I would rather have my time and money back.I would rather have my time and money back.

Damn VR software.) it all seems so innocent, but still not for children (I still burst into giggles from \\"When Doves Cry's\\" references to animals striking curious poses and cheer Prince on when he proclaims \\" Do you want him or do you want me? Cuz I want you!\\" in \\"The Beautiful Ones\\"). Ah Nostalgia.<br /><br />Every time I listen to this album, I'm consumed with laughter because my 11 year old mind could not concieve any notion of what a night with \\"Darling Nikki\\" would entail and the third verse of \\"Purple Rain\\" is so trippy (if you know what I'm singing about up here come on raise your hands).<br /><br />All of that aside, this is one of the greatest albums of the 80's and the greatest album by the Purple One. Bravo!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|this app works great on my kindle fire there are many many lelvels to choose from.  some of them you have to unlock and others already for u.
B005ZUR724|1.0|This is a decent MMORPG for iOS and Android. GL has screwed this one up though. Connecting to any server requires the latest version which is **NOT** available on the Amazon App Store. Kindle Fire users **CANNOT** currently play this game.
B000BTC5LW|4.0|I personally like the concert, the music was well selected, fitted well together, nice effects. The people performing were not really enjoying themselves, if you see the line up you will realise that these people have done this many times, and this is nothing new for them. However, they did a very good job and the tracks were played well. David Gilmour seems to be enjoying himself and really does well.<br /><br />The quality of the sound is really good. Played on my modern calibrated equipment, the sound was really good. The surround effects are well made, and the Dolby track is very good.<br /><br />Picture quality is not so good. Another reviewer had the reason in his review and it makes sense. However, this is a music concert and the video is secondary to the sound. The sound is good.<br /><br />Get this before its gone.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|This is my biggest complaint, Love amazon and kindle is very cool but the app should allow for books to be played so you can listen to them as they are read to you similar to audible.com. for driving etc
B000EHSVSC|4.0|Americans never really understood how they were dragged into World War I during the period from 1914 to 1918; and the horrors that humanity went through in that period, in which thirteen million people lost their lives, made the United States, which, like the rest of the world, was to suffer further horrors in the Great Depression of the 1930s, wary of entering international conflicts that had nothing to do with them.  Even the rumblings from Adolf Hitler in Germany meant nothing to the U.S.--for a while, anyway.  When Japanese emperor Hirohito ordered a surprise attack on America's Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii on December 7, 1941, however, America woke up to a new kind of reality, as World War II was bought to their very doorstep.  This was the story told with frightening accuracy, from both sides of the conflict, in the multi-national 1970 World War II epic TORA! TORA! TORA!  Based on Gordon Prainge's book \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\", and Landislas Farago's book \\"The Broken Seal\\", this well-mounted movie, which, at a cost of $25 million, was among the most expensive films made in Hollywood up to that time, focuses, on the way the Imperial Japanese navy prepared to do what its emperor was ordering of it, and the way the American military staff in Hawaii were trying to understand what they were up to.  The truth of the matter is that America and Japan had both been at odds for some time over various issues; negotiations between the two countries were going on for much of 1941; and if Japan could not get what it considered a fair deal from a country that was still largely considered isolationist and inferior in the eyes of the world, then it would take it all by force.  As far as the American military was concerned, there was no indication that a sneak attack of any kind was imminent on them; and it was assumed diplomacy would work things out.  It then came through a deciphering of secret Japanese communiqués that an attack was under way; but by the time the deciphering was in the hands of the Pacific fleet staff, it was too late.  Pearl Harbor was virtually destroyed in a matter of two hours; numerous battleships, including the Arizona, sank to the bottom; and almost 2,500 people were killed.  It was the greatest single loss of life in any attack on the United States...until September 11, 2001.  It would have been tempting for 20th Century Fox, the studio that funded and distributed this film, to make it a jingoistic piece of propaganda and paint the United States as the victim (even the 2001 blockbuster PEARL HARBOR, a near-enough remake of TORA! TORA! TORA!, flirted with that); but, like on its 1962 classic THE LONGEST DAY, it avoided doing so.  Instead, thanks to the participation of two prominent Japanese directors, along with veteran U.S. director Richard Fleischer (THE BOSTON STRANGLER; FANTASTIC VOYAGE), the film looks at the events leading up to December 7, 1941 from each side of the conflict, with the Japanese, including their revered Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (Soh Yamamura), anxious to strike but knowing full well what it may mean for their empire in the end, and the Americans misreading Japanese intentions and disregarding the numerous warning signs until they are backed into a corner.  The film gives equal credit to both sides, as befitting as accurate an account of history as Hollywood can muster.  Featuring the Oscar-winning special effects work of L.B. Abbott, A.D. Flowers, and Art Cruickshank, TORA! TORA! TORA! also features solid actors like Jason Robards, Martin Balsam, Joseph Cotten, Richard Anderson, George Macready, James Whitmore, Wesley Addy, Leon Ames, and others rounding out a fine cast, along with Goldsmith's always dependable scoring genius, which here combines American and Oriental themes in a unique way.  By avoiding the romantic sub-plots and the gung-ho theatrics of the Jerry Bruckheimer-produced and Michael Bay-directed PEARL HARBOR, TORA! TORA! TORA!, though an unavoidably lengthy movie, makesitself stay truly memorable in the way it sticks with the historical facts; and it will certainly make the viewer wonder just how certain wars throughout history get started.  In the case of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, which led to six months of victory for them in the Pacific before they were ambushed at Midway in June 1942, it was a combination of misreadings, misunderstandings, and (on the part of the Japanese) the nerves of riverboat gamblers that made history happen.  And as TORA! TORA! TORA! makes abundantly clear, such is often the way history gets made.
B004EPZ07U|5.0|I had turned down seeing Green Lantern in it's theatrical release due to some negative reviews I had read. Turns out Green Lantern was one of the most enjoyable movies I have seen in quite a while. It raised me off my chair when the movie began and set me back down when the credits started.  Ryan Reynolds was very well cast as Hal Jordan and is an almost cloned image of the reinvented comic character from the early sixties.  The special effects were top notch and captured the original comic book series perfectly.
1597801585|3.0|The book is a case of Macros and Micros for me, and in the end left me somewhat unsatisfying.  The overall (macro) tone, new ideas, conceptualizations, and story are solid and thought provoking.  However the execution (micro) of the novel was quite lacking in my oppinion.  None of the characters were particularly likeable, and all of them were extreemly flat.  The use of foreign (thai, chinese, etc) word was unneccessary and poorly executed.  The pacing left something to be desired as well, since for the first 1/2 of the book nothing really happens.<br /><br />At times I felt like I was trudging through this novel, then there would be a chapter or two offering hope of it picking up, but ultimately it did not.  Sure, the action picked up, but when I closed it after finishing I had a sort of empty feeling. I think since there wasn't a main character to champion the end of the novel came and I just didn't really care what happend or \\"who won\\" (so to speak).<br /><br />Upon further reflection though I did take some positives from the Wind Up Girl.  The world that Bacigalupi creates really is quite interesting.  The concepts he toys with for a dystopian future are unique to my reading, and I appreciate that.  I feel that there are important concepts here that are worth the read itself.<br /><br />Pros: Unique Dystopian Universe, Concepts worth thinking about<br /><br />Cons: Terrible Characters (flat, boring, too flawed to root for), boring pacing (plot rambles for 1/2 the book before it starts moving forward), Foreign words inserted for \\"local flavor\\" proved useless and therefore an annoyance<br /><br />Overall:  3 stars, far from perfect but worth a read.
B0063IH60K|4.0|its a simple fun game. Runs smoothly,no bugs as of yet. I like that you can change the background of the game. it gives it something different to look at while playing a card game.
B006O5XYWG|1.0|This movie had issues. It the picture was very jerky and the words didnt match the picture. We deleted it and downloaded it again and got the same result. Requesting refund for both.
B004BSFC6Y|1.0|The high contrast design fascinates her. Beyond that I do not recommend this product. It didn't fit her at three months old. They where not shaped for the feet so they fit awkwardly. They did not rattle loudly either.
B000002L61|5.0|This is prime good melodic metal. The best kind , the type of rock that has melody and great singing. The playing is more complex too. This was perhaps Dio's highpoint of his career in sales and songwriting ability. He had a fantastic career going back to the sixties but only really came into his own in the 70's. By the 80's he was laying down fine cd's like this one, and there isn't a bad song on this one. it has the fm radio hit 'last in line' on it , and the influences of black sabbath and rainbow are very strong on this one. That's a good thing because those are great groups.  The cd is probably the best one for a casual fan of this late great artist to enjoy. I have them all and this one is his best probably.  There are no extra tracks on it though. Still it's the one to buy for fans and casual fans as well.
B004U52VPS|4.0|More than double the retail price was a bummer, but I paid it because my grandson really wanted this game, and we both love Angry Birds. The game is a lot of fun, and we both enjoy it. Shipping was super fast - ordered Friday, received Monday.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Now, this app is worth installing especially cuz it was free. 2nd works good 4 the procastinator like myself who users their phone (evo 3d) 2 work. Too bad I couldn't transfer it to iPad2.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|We have enjoyed having all of the Harry Potter series. We were just saying that it was nice to not have to not wait for the next part of the story.  We have been watching one per night, and that works. Since there is not much on TV that we like it is nice to have a series of movies that we have paid big bucks to see. We like all of the extras, such as interviews and deleted scenes that are included.  It is also fun to see the actors who start out quite young and get older as the story progresses. There seems to be more than I remember.  At any rate this is a good series to have.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I have the Kindle android app on my verizon galaxy tablet, and while the download process is a little more complicated, and takes longer than my Nook for android app, I like Kindle/amazon prices better for some books.  The other rather fabulous perk of the kindle app, is that wherever I am on the pc cloud reader, it keeps me on my galaxy android kindle app as well.  Well done!  =)
B000001GAM|5.0|...but I cannot help myself, even though I know I can add little to the preceding responses. Rather than attempt any detailed analysis, I'll simply share with you a couple of moments which make the hairs on my nape prickle: the Wagner tubas' \\"Farewell to life\\" motif at the beginning of the Adagio and that wondrous moment at 19'23\\" when St Peter's gates swing open and a sonic panorama worthy of John Martin's epic landscape \\"The Plains of Heaven\\" lies before us like a dream.<br /><br />Time is irrelevant in Giulini's cosmic vision; his command of legato and phrasing ensure that we are never conscious of his profligacy. The quality of both the playing and sound - despite being only 16 bit \\"red book\\" standard - is demonstration level. (OK; I detected one minor mini-blip from the brass at 3'03\\"; it was a live performance and even the VPO are only human.) There is no audience noise and you could not ask for more depth or clarity in the auditory picture. I came late to this masterpiece of an interpretation and it encourages me to explore other of Giulini's Bruckner recordings; what a pity he never made a complete cycle.
B005AUWXZ0|2.0|Well even after reading the reviews I couldn't imagine Cars 2 being so dreadful after how wonderful the first film was.  My children all enjoy the first film.  However, I was mortified when I saw a car being tortured and then killed!  At this point I was so thankful that my children weren't even interested enough in the film to watch more than 5 minutes and by this point in the film they had lost interest entirely.  While the plot is OK - it is not geared towards the same audience that the previous film had been, and it is quite complicated for young children to follow.  I do not want to explain why cars are being tortured for information to my 4 year, let alone my 8 year old.  I am shocked that this film doesn't carry a PG13.<br /><br />It is unfortunate the beloved characters from the previous movie are almost all left behind.  Further the movie isn't just dark in the sense of the plot, but it is just dark.  The previews on YouTube have the best parts of the movie - stick to those and you won't waste your money or be terribly disappointed.<br /><br />I wish I could take the movie back.  It was a complete let down and waste of money.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like it, rather additive and a joyous way to waste my time.   slightly challenging, yet gripping great game overall.

B000Q9ISSQ|4.0|The audio book sat on my shelf for quite some time before I got round to listening to it. Being an Aussie away from home, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It made me homesick, wanting to go back and visit the places Bill had seen but I had not. I wish he would go back and write another.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I finished this book in 4 days...which is pretty good for me and my schedule. I loved it. Its definitely one of the best fictions ive read.
B005CS3VQ0|5.0|One of my favorite books this year. Wide-ranging but very smart. There are chapters about the the translation industry, the European Court of Justice's use of a comparative method in legal rulings, the very important history of biblical translation, the first simultaneous translation at the Nuremberg trials, and why Russia is the only member of the UN employing L2 translators, plus some speculative sociology about why literary translators are willing to reluctant to preserve social class makers when translating.

0439023513|5.0|I was a little worried that I would be disappointed with this book after reading some of the other not so happy reviews.  I loved the other two and read them each in a day or so.  Like some others have said if one is looking for a fairytale, this is not the book; but really I can't see why after reading the first book that anyone would be led to even believe that was possible.  The series started off with a world that was so sadly wrong and distributing, I find it funny that anyone would consider it could have a perfectly happy ending.  For those who didn't like that some of the characters were killed off...  I'm not sure that without one loss in particular that Katniss would have done what she did to essentially put an end to the fight.  Oh and those who complained the author changed the characters and such in this book...  What would you expect?  To live through all that and not be effected?  Silly.  I didn't see much of a change myself anyway.  I personally liked the ending and I think the author ended the book in the best way she could considering the world she created.  I also thought it was a happy ending, not perfect, but happy.  Plus he (I won't spoil it for anyone) had my vote the whole time :)!
B005QPMB2Y|4.0|I installed a zmodo system, this little app is great!, I can pull up video from anywhere to check my house. no problems... setup was good. just get try the free app first to make sure it will work for you. I use this on my Droid X and Kindle fire.

1451648537|4.0|Walter Isaacson has written a well-researched book about Steve Jobs and the making of Apple. He, however, almost deifies Jobs and his talents. It reads like a novel. I nevertheless enjoyed the book as I have all of Mr. Isaacson's books.

B006C45CFG|5.0|A good old western, a la Gunsmoke, with a few aggressive giant extraterrestrial insects and a major-size interstellar spaceship.  Excellent combination of two genres.  Kind of like James Bond meets Back to the Future (the visit-the-past sequel).

0316017930|5.0|There are books that make you think and then there are books that make you think and somehow along the way manage to change your entire perception. \\"Outliers\\" is the last of the two. When I received my syllabus for this semester I felt a tad miffed because I noticed that one author was mentioned twice as required reading. \\"How can this ever help me with the emerging trends in higher education?\\"  I asked myself. The answer to that question remains unanswered; however, I have realized that this book can help me with my life and my own personal success.<br /><br />Like the author I have spent a decent chunk of my life wondering what it is that makes some people successful and others not as successful. Like most of the population, who haven't yet read \\"Outliers,\\" I assumed that these people must have some characteristics that separate them from everyone else. After all, the self-help section is full of books trying to sell you on the habits or characteristics you must have if you want to succeed. Malcolm Gladwell looks deeper into various success stories and reveals that so much more goes into success. Success is more about factors you cannot control like your birth date, your culture, where you are from. It really was a fascinating read and I have not stopped talking about it to everyone I meet. I would strongly encourage everyone to take a few hours and read it for themselves. This is not a read you will regret.
0061969656|4.0|With this volume in the saga of Alfred the Great, the series seems to be running down...  Uhtred of Bebbanburg, who has been Alfred's loyal sword arm through many travils, is again called into service as the \\"Sword of the Saxons.\\" A dying King Alfred finally awards Uhtred with some fine lands that promise to make him wealthy, if he manages to live long enough to enjoy his rewards. But before Uhtred can make full use of his new status, he must assist young King Edward in repulsing the Danes, led by Jarl Sigurd and Jarl Cnut, who are in the process of invading Wessex and Mercia from East Anglia.  Alfred's eldest daughter Aethelflaed, who is romantically entwined with Uhtred through an adulterous realtionship, manages to assist in the Saxon triumph over the invading Danes.  But there must be more yet to come in this saga, since it does not seem to have a real final outcome. So...stay tuned, for Cornwell will undoubtedly write more of Uhtred. The pace of the storytelling seemed slower than usual, but the battle scenes are classic Cornwell, and are drenched with blood. A decent page turner, but not the best of the series which is why only 4 stars.

1594202710|5.0|I would recommend this book who wants to read about Chinese history, particularly that from about 1940 until the present day. A word of caution however, it would be best to have some knowledge of the Cold War and some education about Marxist-Leninism and perhaps some knowledge of the early history of the rise of communism in it's early days in Chinese history. Also some previous knowledge of the of the communist and nationalist war would be helpful to the reader.  Such a background may be of help in better understanding parts of Dr. Kissinger's book and may make for a faster read.  I found this book to be a great reminder to me of the historical events which occurred in the Soviet-USA Cold War period while educating me about the specifics of what was going on in China during the same period which was largely ignored by the press in favor of Soviet issues. Thus most of us who grew up during the Cold War could benefit from reading this book. The first time I had heard much of China was when the Chinese crossed into North Korea and my dad came rushing into our house to tell us about it. But of course back in the 1950's and 1960's the Soviets had a better chance of destroying the world than the Chinese with their limited military.  So for me the insider knowledge that Kissinger had about China and particularly the secret negotiations that occurred between the US government and China stretching back to the Vietnam years was most interesting. Kissinger does a good job of portraying the personalities of Mao, Chou, and Nixon during this period especially by including actual conversations between these three people and himself. It was also interesting to hear about the opening of the Sino-American relationship and the fear that China had of the Soviets which, at least in Kissinger's view, was the prime reason for the Chinese to seek out support at least psychologically from the US. I also never knew that the Chinese feared encirclement from the Soviets, other Asian countriesincluding Vietnam and of course from US strategy.  I think however that Kissinger became somewhat carried away with explaining things over and over again between some chapters of the book. Also the early history of China, while interesting, lacked much detail which I suppose would be better left to books devoted to those periods but it did help in explaining China's feeling of being the only country under heaven that could be the center of the world.   What will happen next in the history of the world is of course anyone's guess but the specter of the rising China I believe will be the major issue on the plate of the US for many years to come.

B0002CTQYW|5.0|Le Diner de Cons was one of the most funniest movies<br />that I have seen in a long time.  The purchase came<br />earlier then expected, in excellent condition (new) and<br />neatly packaged.  It seems that the French have the greatest<br />gift for humor and their movies prove it. Thank you<br />for sellling French movies with English sub-titles.<br />Although, I do speak English, I like the French-speaking<br />voices to listen to, since I am trying to  learn the<br />language. At first, it was a bit of a distraction to<br />try to watch a movie and have to  read the English, but,<br />after a few good French movies, I am not even aware now,<br />that I am watching, listening, and reading.  I reccommend<br />buying French movies and having the greatest enjoyment<br />possible.  Moxiewalk
1400062756|3.0|Purchased book as a requirement to a college course. Author has a great thesis and good supporting ideas, but the reading is so incredibly dry and the thought of having to read another long overly repititious chaper almost makes my eyes bleed and my brain go numb. The book could have gotten its point across in about half the pages. The \\"examples\\" are all mostly geared to sports and that makes it that much worse.
031606792X|5.0|Love all the Twilight saga books and movies however I would expect the ending to be more dramatic than it was. Also there are couple chapters that are too long for what they are describing, they just seem to drag a little too much.Other than that really loved it and would recommend it.
0061537969|5.0|I absoltuley loved this book and have been telling everyone about it since I first started reading it!  I started crying in the first chapter, and cryed again at the end.  Enzo is such a lovable character!  I am a dog lover, but I think anyone would love this book.  I am not a race fan, but loved the analogies with life.  A great read I could read again and again.

B00005JPLW|4.0|My husband always likes a good action packed thriller and I have to admit there is a part of me that does too. I also thought the visual effects in the movie were interesting and even though parts of it seemed to be over the top I think that is what made the film interesting.<br /><br />Anyone who sits down to watch a movie and starts picking it apart because that couldn't possibly happen in real life needs to reevaluate why they watch movies in the first place. Yes, there are times when we want something to be realistic, but the whole point of a movie,play,art etc. is because it is supposed to evoke emotions in us that we wouldn't normally have in our real lives on a daily basis.
B002ZG976U|3.0|This was not a great movie, but Christina Aguilera's voice and performance alone made me buy it.  Fantastic.  Cher of course is Cher and there will never be another like her.  I enjoyed the film.
B001HN6922|1.0|Awful movie and not geared for small children as the first was, but I don't know what age group they would be going for with cars that have eyeballs? (Tongue fully planted in cheek.) This was designed to attempt to indoctrinate the young and thick in political agenda. NOTHING like the original and that wonderful soundtrack.  This is a violent propaganda film, done in cartoon, that degrades blue collar workers, as well as American oil companies (No, not middle eastern oil, just ours.) Like a bait and switch going on here, where they build your trust in a wonderful movie with beloved characters, then sneak this total MEAN garbage in the next round.  Contains violent kill scenes, torture, death, and bombs strapped on Mator!  Winnie the Pooh and Mickey Mouse next for this brand of hate? Be sure to borrow or rent this before buying it.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|I only recently discovered Lady Ga Ga while watching the William Clinton Foundation Decade of Difference concert on Yahoo!  The entire program was wonderful, but in my opinion [and I think the audience agreed] Ms. Ga Ga stole the show.  I purchased the \\"Born This Way\\" CD based on the diversity, talent and originality she exhibited during the concert and am very pleased with the recordings.  Take it from me...I've been around through a number of music genres...this is the first real talent and intelligence I have seen in one artist in a very long time.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Not only the most read book in the world, but the most useful app in the world too. The reading plans included are awesome and really help you stay engaged in daily reading of scripture. You can also take notes and highlight text for future reference. It has encouraged me to read the entire Bible two times in the past two years. You can also easily change translations so you can reference several to find the one that's easiest for you to understand.
0345522478|3.0|This is a sword and sorcery novel written about a 2,000 year old druid.  A druid in the modern sense - eco friendly, rather than the historical sense of greed, power, and human sacrifice.  The main character has been running for 2,000 years from his godly nemesis, finally gets fed up and decides to fight.  The stories are coherent and don't have huge gaps like many stories today.  The druid doesn't have any offensive spells, they are used for defense and giving people wedgies, so he relies on his sword.  The author was told by a SCA member that sword fights don't last long, so they don't in the books either.  You end up with a sword and sorcery book without the sword or the (offensive) sorcery.  Fortunately, the books are well written and he does a pretty good job of building up to the anti-climaxes, which is why it gets 3 stars instead of 2 stars from me.  Personally, I've never cared for the books where the gods play a major role.  Humanity ought not to be able to deal with gods, much less defeat them.  Yet in this book half the characters are gods and Atticus, the druid, has little problem defeating them.  As his apprentice tells him at one point, druid 5, gods 0 and that was before a large battle in which several gods die.  Kind of makes you wonder why he hid for 2,000 years.  The one thing the author isn't consistent on is his approach to the gods and their power.  He explains in his third book how it works, the gods get their power from being worshipped.  Yet the no longer worshipped and so impotent thunder god, Thor like, but not the Norse deity, that joins their party in the third book is still able to take out a god with each lightning bolt, that's a pretty potent impotence.  I thought he should have just used the ancient gods in his book.  He only deals with one current religion and that is Christianity.  The only reason he seems to have included Christianity is to poke fun at it.  The friendly widow has to get drunk to go to church.  Jesus joins Atticus in some drinks, gets tipsy and does a fair amount of cursing.  It didn't add anything to the book and should have irritated most Christians.  There is no point in being hateful and bigoted.  If you have an issue with a religion, write a treatise, not a fantasy book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|As far ss solitaire apps go this one is great. I like the different options and ways to play that this game. offers that others don't. It keeps the game interesting.

B000AMJC2K|5.0|This product far exceeded my expectations.  I look for a while trying to find the appropriated monitor stand.  There were several listed that were close to $200.  I thought I'd give this a try and it is excellent.  It worked exactly as promised and had several mounting solutions.  Even though it is light in weight it feels very sturdy and I don't feel that my monitor is \\"at risk\\".  Highly recommend.

B0063IH60K|5.0|Great app. Classic solitaire --and FREE :)  There is a pop up ad before every new game (since this is a FREE version) but that doesn't bother me at all. I couldn't really ask for more from this app.

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I don't like reviews from folks who own a product 2 days and are suddenly \\"experts\\" on it.  I've had this case on my Fire for 6 weeks, so take my comments for what they're worth.  Pro's: Lightweight, hard back shell offers decent shock protection, does not interfere with any portion of the screen, ability to act as a stand in Landscape orientation, excellent cover retention to Fire  Con's: Rubberized covering on hard plastic shell beginning to peel at edges, stand only works in one orientation, stand locking groove is very shallow (slips out of \\"stand\\" position easily), elastic band is cheap  The strength of this cover is the solid, simple way that the Fire clips into it.  No way its going to come off accidentally.  The hard plastic shell gives me great peace of mind that my Fire will withstand minor drops without damage...not a full-blown OtterBox level of protection, but very good.  Another HUGE PLUS of this system is that it relies solely on the edge clips to firmly grip the Fire rather than having edge pockets that come around to the face side of the Fire.  My daughter has a different cover that has material around the screen perimeter.  The cover only blocks the non-touch perimeter around the actual touch portion of the screen, but it is very difficult to touch the menu bar which sits right at the screen edge in many applications.  Whether you get this cover or some other one, BE SURE that it does not cover any part of the face of the Fire (i.e. only get a clip-in cover)  I am a bit concerned regarding the rubberized covering beginning to peel.  It is very minor at this stage and seems limited to areas where my hands contact it the most.  The rubberized coating is only a couple mills thick (think of it as a coat of rubber paint), so its really just a cosmetic concern more than a functional one.  I can only give this 4 stars due to the weak stand function and the peeling rubberized coating.  Neither is that big of a deal, but I expect better at this price point.
0062060554|4.0|If you are looking for a book to keep you up at night; look no further.    Watson has managed to create an absolute page-turner, capturing the possible trappings of the human mind.  We all wonder about our place in the world and we depend on the pillars of our lives, our families; friends; our jobs, in order to make sense of the world we live in and how to react to it.  The main character of this story gets stripped of all these comforts and is forced to reinvent and rediscover her sense of identity every single day.  As the reader faces this unusual problem with the protagonist, a sense of reality is born right alongside it; struggling through the information we are given we try to make sense of the mess we have found ourselves in and end up becoming completely unable to stop thinking about the book and simply have to keep turning the pages in order to get to the end.    But don't let me ruin your experience of the novel by hyping it out of proportion; there is a very limited variety of suspects and it becomes pretty obvious early on during the reading who the suspects are and the plot is not that difficult to unravel.  However, the author has succeeded in keeping the confusion and suspense going right until the very end.  Overall a gripping and interesting read.
B004UUKDNA|4.0|I like most of the songs.  I'd just like to buy new music once that wasn't featured in a commercial.  I can't listen to the songs that have been played over and over on commercials.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|My kindle Fire snaps in place and fits perfectly in this protective (shell) cover. There are no intrusive elastic corner bands, it's dedicated for Kindle Fire only (which is a good thing, I thought). The inside of flip cover that covers the screen is made of soft material- extra protection for the screen. Easy access to the micro usb port, power switch and headphone/speaker jack. This product is actually bi-color, the flip cover is always black and the hard back shell comes in 3 different colors. Since there are only 3 color choices: black, graphite and pink, I picked pink so that I can locate it easier. I hope they can add few more color selections. Overall I am satisfied with this product.
B004EPYZXU|2.0|I kind of felt like I was ripped off after watching this movie and I saw it for free. It was not a good film, lacked substance and originality and they didn't even sew on the NASA patch correctly on one of the space suits which was a little bit humorous. I love a good science fiction movie but the only part that was good about this one was I did not have to pay to see it in a theater and thus I gave it two stars instead of one only for that reason.
B005LFQRTC|5.0|Compared to the Universal UK version out there, this new set from Universal looks really good! The picture looks to have been remastered in some way. For '70s TV, this is a good looking picture and sound. I have had the UK DVDs for years and now glad I can replace those ugly discs with these newer ones.<br />Come on Universal! Where are the rest of the seasons?<br />Can't believe it took this long to get this series on DVD here in the states.<br />But the wait was well worth it!

B0063IH60K|5.0|I found this app to be of the utmost quality. Compared to others it clearly outshone all that rivaled/rivals. Fantastic programming at work here!
B004XWLN20|5.0|I recieved my box set xmas and must say that I just love it. This is my all time favorite show and I've never had more fun watching a show. Do you want drama? Check. Do you want romance? Check. Do you want twisted romance (Lexana)? Check. Do you want Comic book action? Check. Do you want humor (Clois)? Check. Do you want A great charecter actor (John Glover)? Check. In short this show has it all.  You'll read in other reviews that the pilot is a must episode, the 100th episode, or the crashing meeting between Clark and Lois (\\" Just look at his face\\"). I agree with them all but let me direct you to the first episode of the 3rd season \\"Exile\\". If you remember bad Superman in the 3rd movie this is the same idea but a lot more fun. And instead of Superman and Clark Kent faceing off. It's Father vs Son. Just a classic episode.   As for the box set you get two booklets with great pictures and the discs themselves Seasons 1-5 in one 6-10 in the other. The one problem is that the disc are in the booklets tight and do not come out as easy as they should. Scrathing is a concern. Also there is a another booklet with the episode guide that also has some behind the scenes pictures and some set art sketches that are cool. And a Daily Planet News Paper which is nothing more than silly.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|the ads at the bottom of this game had adult content at the bottom... something that is not appropriate when you consider you have a wide range of age of people playing these games...
0451232577|2.0|After having written so many compelling and interesting books, I think that this time the title aptly describes the author, Ken Follett, a fallen giant.  I was sickened to read the first section about the miners and mining town in Wales.  Didn't the author take this directly from Emile Zola's Germinal (a coalminers' strike in northern France in the 1860s) sanitizing it a bit?  Is plagiarism no longer plagiarism if material is copied from a book written 150 years ago?  From there it was all downhill.....cookie cutter characters with no depth, predictable story lines, ad infinitum(or until page 130 when I tossed the book in the garbage)....The other 1 & 2 star reviews have said it all.
0756686970|5.0|This book was a big hit with my 7 & 9 year olds.  It's an easy read and the illustrations are great.  A Star Wars Lego fan must have!  Kudos to Lego for connecting with the younger Star Wars fans!

B000AS4L16|1.0|As the son of a member of the Polish underground whose unit Zoska was recognized for saving 350 Jews during the 1944 Warsaw Uprising I would like to say that the emotions of my father and myself, after watching the parts of the movie involving Poles, were that of disgust and anger.  This part seemed to us to be patently manipulated to shamelessly further an anti-Polish agenda.  I remember how, as people who speak Polish, and are familiar with the realities of WW II occupied Poland, we felt, as we watched this movie, how the questions posed to the apparently poor, uneducated and unsophisticated Polish villagers were leading, contained double meanings, and/or were taken out of context, and were intended to elicit specific responses.  To boot, we perceived the tone of the translator to be aggressive, rude, manipulative, patronizing, hostile, accusatory and demeaning, while the villagers were clearly being polite, non confrontational, agreeable, welcoming, and basically human to strangers who were to them unlikely visitors to their remote and obscure village. The loss in translation of the subtle nuances of tone, use of specific words, etc. appeared to me and my father to have been deliberately exploited by the director to foster an unflattering image of all Poles.  This, alas, is not something that would be apparent to the non-Polish speaking viewer.  The choice of interviewees, the losses in translation, the omission of Polish suffering as well as the failure to mention positive behavior of Polish Catholics towards Jews, coupled with alleged false facts (I personally do not remember the false claim reported by others to have been allegedly made in the movie that the Polish underground refused to provide arms to the Jewish ghetto), the non-Polish viewer is thereby unsuspectingly left with an unmistakably negative but false and unfair impression of the role and culpability of Poles in the persecution of Jews by the German Nazis.    In summary, I found this work to be insidiously and dangerously misleading, in line with communist propaganda, which in the past sought to undermine any support for a free Poland by encouraging a negative opinion of Poles and Poland.  This movie was, in fact, made and released, while Poland was still on its knees under Soviet control, and in my view, is the moral equivalent of a kick to a person laying unconsciously and helplessly on the ground after an unprovoked severe beating.  I personally believe that Lanzmann's \\"Shoah\\", is unworthy of the subject matter, and needs to be vigorously challenged in the name of common decency, the truth, and most importantly, the memory of the millions of Poles who were killed, forced into slave labor, deported, evicted from their land, tortured, maimed, terrorized and starved during the brutal and inhuman occupation of Poland by Germany in the name of \\"Deutschland, Deutschland Uber Alles\\" and \\"Lebensraum\\" for Germans, the memory which he, Lanzmann, sweepingly maligns.  This movie is insensitive to a nation that did much to defy German Nazism, at extreme cost, from the beginning of WW II until the end.   The subject matter of this movie itself is indeed of monumental importance and interest as it, in and of it self, is extremely sobering, thought provoking, and shocking.  This has little to do with Claude Lanzmann, however.  Any documentary on this subject created in a minimally competent fashion would no doubt elicit the same extreme emotions.  When judging this movie and the contributions of the director, one should assess whether the movie took full advantage of the material, and for what.  I believe the material WAS taken advantage of, but to divide, to gratuitously judge and to shamelessly claim the moral high ground, without having earned the right to do so.  I have such strong feelings on this movie that I would loathe watching it again, even though I can watch other movies on WW II and German crimes against humanity.   PS  I did read that Mr. Lanzmann, in regards to questions on the anti Polish bias in the movie, allegedly stated that had he known what he has since learned about Polish WW II history, he would have done the parts on Poland differently.  If this is true, then the parts of the movie regarding Poland SHOULD BE redone, plain and simple.

B005ARYEY6|5.0|This is essential Miles Davis for any serious Miles Davis fan. The only note of caution is that about four of the songs being done repeat on each cd. That being said, they only seem to be really suing the songs as a base for what is some of the most experimental and brilliant jazz ever created. Everyone on it is amazing, bt Miles and Herbie seem to shine the brightest. That being said, the are at times followed very close in what was created by each individual. Harmony in music at its best.
0756655307|3.0|I received this book as a gift from my loving parents that understand how much I love Marvel Comics.  For that reason, I'll love this book.  It was stated in an earlier review from a loving significant other who gave the book to her guy as a gift that he immediately started finding errors.  Our loved ones were fooled.  If I went to buy this for myself, I would have immediately seen the flaws in the information.     My content criticism:  I feel like nobody at Marvel read/edited any of it before letting that publishing company release it.  All you have to do is open to an entry about one of your favorites and you'll feel what I felt reading the New Warriors entry and searching for my favorite character by one of his many alias'(Marvel Boy, Justice, Vance Astrovik, Vance Astro, Major Victory - One small lackluster entry could've satisfied all occurances of this character).Individually, the mistakes in this kind of reference can be laughed off, especially by someone not particularly interested in Marvel or who hasn't read many Marvel Comics.  I however actually felt kind of offended (for lack of a better word to describe the feeling) that this \\"encylcopedia\\" didn't mention much about one of my favorites and when he was mentioned he was listed with incorrect information.  There are lots of others, I was stunned reading through trying to find good info on the characters I love.   There are also lots of incredibly detailed and accurate entries sprinkled about - so I'll give 3 stars for what they got right.  Its the errors that stand out of course.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|As an avid reader and lover of all things King I was not disappointed in the least. I found myself enthralled with the time period, characters and general storyline so much so that I was reluctant to read the end. Virtually impossible to put down despite it's weight (I read the hard cover version), it sucks you down the stairs of Al's closet into the past and keeps you there.   Absolutely on the list of my favorite books.
0756990696|4.0|The beginning of this book was really fantastic. It had an intriguing beginning with a couple interesting questions and was mysterious. As it went on, it explained philosophies of people from a bunch of different eras and got me interested in looking into more about philosophy. The story line that was going on around the philosophy lessons was really interesting too, definitely something I haven't seen before.  However, as the story went on, it began to kind of be like a text book. About half of it was pretty dry. It can be a really slow read. It definitely was for me.  Pretty much don't read this book if you're looking for something with a little more action and plot.
B006C1DH92|5.0|this game is great when u r in the mood. its fun and entertaing.I love this game so much its like a drug
B005OCFGTO|5.0|If you've been picking these movies up one at a time all the way through, this item is not for you. But if you have none, or even one, or two, or three, I still think this is worth it. It's the easiest way to collect the entire series in a neat package, and it's a decent price. No complaints.

B004Z29X3E|5.0|Martha Marcy May Marlene, or \\"M4\\" as I like to call it is one of the best films I've seen this year(I thought the films this year were pretty poor but still)The film follows Martha(Elizibeth Olson) as she desperately makes her escape from a secluded farm in up state New York. She escapes to a nearby town but she's soon confronted by one of her fellow \\"community members\\" from the farm. They share the film's first uncomfortable moment while they eat lunch at the local diner. Martha makes a move for the diner door but he grabs her arm coldly saying \\"what's the matter? you're shake'n\\" then proceeds to leave Martha to her own devices. She's scared and confused but is able to regain her composure enough to call her older sister Lucy(Sarah Paulson).It seems that Martha has being missing for sometime and Lucy is all that remains of her estranged family. Once Martha is reunited with her sister, she attempts to rejoin normal society. Lucy does her best to look after her sister but the mental scars that Martha bares soon become apparent.     As the film progress we get a glimpse into what transpired at the farm. Director T. Sean Durkin choose to hop back and forth from the present to the past to drive the film. Sometimes this approach causes a film to become unfocused or details get muddled but Durkin executes it perfectly. He's slow and methodological with his approach but the slow pace of the film really adds an element of tension that I haven't felt while watching a film for sometime. I found myself clenching my jaw as if watching a speeding car bowling towards an unsuspecting pedestrian.    Aside from superb directing, M4 is supported by fantastic acting. Elizibeth Olsen puts in a strong lead performance as the terrified/mentally ill Martha. She's beautiful and eloquent but her eyes show a deep sadness and unexpressed terror. Sarah Paulson has a solid performance as the well meaning, but overwhelmed and frightened Lucy and John Hawkes channels his inner Charles Manson asthe charismatic cult leader. M4 is a excellent example of a truly unsettling suspense film and a portrait of a troubled and tortured psyche.

B006QF7664|1.0|I read the reviews before renting it - very glad I only rented it enstead of buying it - the reviews posted  seemed to think it was worth watching. I couldn't DISAGREE more. One of the WORST movies I have ever seen. Terrible filmography and ridiculous story arc. Rocks coming to life in the shape of little killer crabs without some explanation of how they can exist in space? . . . Stupid, moronic filmmaking. Don't waste your time or money on this trash.

B0058UXHHK|4.0|(actually from Marjorie's husband - James)  I stumbled across this book on my wife's kindle...read the first chapter, and laid it aside for a few days (very busy).  Then, when I had some time, I began to read again...enjoying it and completing it over the next couple of days.  I was actually surprised that I enjoyed the books so much.  I am a big sci-fi/fantasy buff and do not usually read murder-mysteries with a strong female lead character.  BUT...I really liked the book.  Even though I could not identify with Rose, from a female perspective, Mrs. Swank's writing style kept me hooked.  There is a really good blend of characters, here, lending believability to the development of the story.  Mrs. Swank kept me guessing, just like Rose, about who was trustworthy and who was a threat...to the very end.  Overall, a good read that I recommend.  It's kind of like the chick-flick that you must confess you enjoyed watching with your wife, when it is over.  One more thing, I appreciated the fact that Mrs. Swank avoided the graphic excesses so unnecessarily included in many novels with an adult target audience.
B002ZG980U|5.0|MOVIE was great, left me twisted. Of course I'm one of those who didn't go and see it in the movie theater, but bought as a gift for my Beau because he is a Leonardo fan. This movie did not disappoint.
1577314808|1.0|Recently, I realized that I spend a lot of time thinking of the past and reliving arguments in my mind or focusing on the future and anticipating problems and how I would handle them. I was getting myself worked up all the time and stressing myself out. I wanted to learn more about how to just relax and focus on the present.<br /><br />The first 50 or so page of the book talk about how important it is to focus on the present. I completely agree with that. But then after that, it keeps talking in circles and using vague terms saying the same things. I didn't find anything in there that helped me practice to focus on the present.<br /><br />I am an engineering and science type person. I am not superstitious nor do I believe in psychics, ghosts or anything otherworldly. Ultimately, that's why I couldn't get into this book even though I really tried to. Once I got to about page 100, I stopped reading and just glanced at the rest of the book to see if there was anything that would be more helpful to me. I didn't find anything.<br /><br />To me, a better book about having your brain learn new things, a more science based and factual book which is more my style is \\"The Brain That Changes Itself: Stories of Personal Triumph from the Frontiers of Brain Science\\" by Norman Doidge.

B00003CXBH|5.0|\\"The Mission\\" is the captivating story of Jesuit missionaries' attempts to win the hearts and minds of indigenous people in South America.  The film narrative deals with the religious awaking of Rodrigo Mendoza, played by Robert De Niro, and Father Gabriel's, played by Jeremy Irons, peaceful and determined efforts to provide education and religious teachings.  Whilst the mission established by Father Gabriel becomes prosperous, the Treaty of Madrid reapportions the territory of the mission to Portugal, which is supportive of slavery and thus endangers the safety of the mission's community.  It is protecting the mission that provides a gripping ending, and throughout the movie the viewer is treated to an entrancing film score, and breathtaking cinematography.  Nicholas R.W.

B0053VKP8S|5.0|Firstly, thanks to all those reviewers who took the time to post their comments and experiences with this product. You gave me the info I needed to solve my \\"where's the headphone connection ?!?\\" problems. Thanks.  So - my problem - similar to other postings : new HD TV and sound bar (Panasonic) with not a headphone connection in sight; old tried-and-trusted Dennon amp/speakers with headphone connection; no way to connect the two. Aarrgghh.   Read other reviews, bought this product, plus a digital optical ('Toslink') cable (I have lots of the red-and-white RCA cables in the house, which you also need). Followed instructions in other postings ... make sure little silver switch on this product is set the way you need it; remove plastic protection doo-dads on ends of new Toslink cable (not obvious !); plug one end into 'optical out' on TV, other into this device. Plug red-and white RCA cable into the device and into spare inputs at the back of the old stereo. Plug device into electic power. Switch everything on - wait a couple of seconds - I then switched the sound 'off' on the new sound bar and -- hurrah !! - sound through the headphones. Perfect. Peace and quiet reigns once more in our household. Tah-dah. Couldn't be happier.

B0000549B0|5.0|I ordered this for a Christmas present.  I received it in a very timely manner and I was exactly what my daughter expected.
B0042KZJR8|4.0|I purchased the CD as a Christmas gift from cdgiveaways.com and received it in just two days, despite the last-minute rush.  The item arrived earlier than promised and made it under the tree.  As for the album by Michael Buble', I can see why it was an international best-seller.  Most songs were terrific, but some songs were just OK.  But then again, that can be said for almost any album.
B004Q7CIFI|3.0|Why oh why does my favorite author of all time always need to break out the old tie-dyes and birkenstocks when writing?  This was another great story that kept breaking its own spell on me with political &#34;insights&#34; that were way out of place and contributed nothing to the story.  I guess he feels a &#34;social responsibility&#34; to make his feelings known but the asides are so typical and, unfortunately, off-point, they only serve his concience, nothing else.  I don't want to play spoiler but' for someone who wants to brag about his historical research, his apocalyptic ending was so inaccurate and unbelievable (FYI it will break your heart to know the Rethuglicans were the ones that got the Civil Rights Act through for LBJ), it could only be a lefty fever dream.  it completely spoiled the ride we were on together and made me want to ask Uncle Stevie for a refund.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|it is so good to have an app that can take you anywhere in the Bible and real fast. I love how it has a bunch of devotions that are available according to topic and length of time. I am really enjoying having the Bible app on my kindle fire!!!!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I had a great time with this game because it was both puzzling and relaxing at the same time. I felt challanged but also pacified through the zen-like graphics and music.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|This movie is approximately 2 ½ hours of practically non-stop action coupled with some beautiful shots of Prague, Dubai, Russia, Mumbai India and Budapest.  As expected, there are some awesome stunts (like the promo where you saw Cruise climbing around the outside of a 130 story hotel).  The sand storm is neat, too.  As another reviewer said, the car (toward the end of the film) is awesome.  This movie is well worth the price of admission to see it on the big screen and you will most certainly want the DVD when it becomes available.<br /><br />The movie begins in Budapest where an agent is killed over Russian nuclear launch codes.  Next, we travel to Moscow for a jail break, signaling Ethan's (Cruise) pre-planned escape.  Ethan must impersonate a Russian general and break into the Kremlin, but as he is leaving the Kremlin, parts of it blow up.  The bad guy is a nuclear extremist who is hell-bent on buying the codes and launching a nuclear device. So, the struggle is stopping the bad guys. Because the Kremlin blast appears to be an act of aggression, the IMF officially shuts down their operation.  Ethan's team must go it alone (hence, Ghost Protocol).<br /><br />A very exciting movie.
B004UUKDNA|4.0|I love 7 songs, like 2 songs and hate 1 song. Overall...i think it's a good album.   My favorite is Life On the Nickel. Least fave is Warrant.
B000001ES9|5.0|This album is absolutely fantastic.  This album has some excellent guitar work and drums (even before Neil).  It also has the very, very cool blues tune Here Again.  This song just takes me to another time and place.  Oh yeah, Working Man is on this album too!
0740748475|5.0|There are not enough words to explain the brilliance of this comic collection. It is humourous enough for the kids but sharp enough for the grown-ups. This is the perfect gift for the Calvin and Hobbes fan. It is mighty heavy and cumbersome, but definitely worth it and truly a magical read!
B0063IH60K|4.0|the popups are a little annoying, but the gameplay is good and what the heck, it's free.  the settings are also nice.  a good choice.
B005QBKXOQ|5.0|Great artist and music. One of my favorite musicians. Highly recommended for everyone. Awesome song list. Not quite as good as his previous work but still very solid
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Let me put it like this: I read it in 24 hours.  Within the first few pages I was sucked into the furture world of district 12 which not only feels like a future place, but also very primitive at the same time.  This book reminds me somewhat of the Lord of the Flies.  It is survival of the fitest at its core, with a love story intertwined.  The only real gripe I have with the story is the reasoning behind the games.  The games remind people in all of the districts that the Capital is in charge, and these games are a reminder of how much authority the Capital has over its people.  It basically creates fear so that no one will rebell.  But if one of my children were to fight in the Hunger Games, I'd be fighting tooth and nail to get them out of it.    Other than that fact, I very much enjoyed this book and cannot wait to start Catching Fire!  A quick and intense read in which you likely won't be able to put down!

B0021L8V0M|2.0|The action is impressive, the stunts fantastic. Great movie as long as the viewer's mind is kept in check. If not, the fact that the story makes no sense becomes evident. The defection at the beginning in particular is inexplicable. And since someone was obviously hired to prepare occasional Russian dialogue, how did the movie makers miss the fact that Chenkov is not a woman's surname? As in other Slavic languages, males surnames end in -ov, female in -ova. This is the sort of elementary blunder which ruins the suspension of disbelief.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app works really well with my Kindle Fire. It's the best free app out there. I totally recommend it.
B005ZUR724|1.0|I'll change to five stars when they fix the update issue. Its an incredible game when it can be played.
B000001E3V|5.0|This might be the best live album ever recorded. If you've ever wondered why they once called Eric Clapton \\"god,\\" then you owe it to yourself to strap on your headphones and fire up this album. If this doesn't put some wiggle in your hips, then you might be dead. \\"Why Does Love Got to Be So Sad\\" contains some of his most vicious guitar work. In a word: \\"powerful.\\" It's too bad Derek & The Dominos had such a short life.
B004047XXO|5.0|Great 3D graphics.  Enjoyed the movie with the grandkids.  Arrived quickly from Amazon.  3D are such a price bargain compared to the stores.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love solitaire &amp; this app makes it fun &amp; easy to use anytime, anywhere! The one touch option is so much better than apps where you have to drag the cards to the desired spot. It also has an auto finish feature, furthering its ease of use. It's definitely the best I've come across!
B004XNGKBS|5.0|I got this app awhile ago and use it when I need to make notes.  I think it works well and has been very useful for me.  I need to try it with a stylus but expect that will only improve my handwriting.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|These guys just keep putting out fantastic albums. Lonely Boy drives the list - with sounds from Motown to Black Rebel Motorcycle club, check these guys out if you like a bit of Rock in your Roll.
B005I6EVUG|4.0|I read the reviews of other people who gave it a one or two and I think they are way too critical.  I have a Kindle Fire and I didn't have any trouble getting it in.  Don't get me wrong it's a tight fit, but I would think one would want a tight fit.  The only reason I didn't give this case five stars is because it does not close completely.  However, it is only 1/8 of an inch or less from complete closure.  I love the design of the case.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This was an excellent transaction.  The product was in new condition, as promised.  The delivery was quick. I expreienced no hiccups throughout the transaction.  Thanks.  I very much appreciate that.
B0063IH60K|5.0|best solitaire app out there, for a free app, the ads aren't bad at all. I have it for both my phone and kindle
B004HEXSLI|5.0|This is a good read for anyone teaching, lecturing, learning about right brain thinking and living.   It certainly offers a great balance against the left brain dominance that we default to. Yes, even right brain thinkers function from there. You will love the anatomy of Nirvana. You can tame your ego with this knowledge.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is great and fun, espically for being free too! Endless entertainment! It has 117 mini addicting games and each one is fun.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Nice game. Replaces my pda game that I play when I don't want to focus on a book or something else. Like playing with a deck of cards.
031606792X|1.0|After reading all the books in the series; I have drawn the conclusion that these books were designed to give me a migraine/sinus headache. I definitely without a shadow of a doubt loathe Bella and Edward; mainly Bella. Bella is ungrateful and bipolar to Jacob. After she transformed to a vampire, she became a bigger piece of toilet paper to Jacob; as did Edward. This book or the series was under developed, rushed, and terrible. Why in the world would they have Jacob imprint on Renesmee? Better yet, why does Renesmee exist? If I were Stephanie Meyer, I would have Jacob move on to someone better and then have Bella in-furiously jealous of it and love struck. I would have Bella chasing Jacob; Edward chasing Bella to amplify the triangle more . She called my Jacob a mutt and wanted to rip his throat out? Bella is not a matyr, she gets mad for giving Charlie a heads up when it is clear that she had not thought her whole life through. I think that she rushed this whole thing and did not take the time to develop other characters. Jacob, Rosalie, Carlisle,Seth, Leah, and Alice were the only likable characters. Edward is just UGH, calling Jacob name in one tongue and showing him gratitude in another tongue.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love this game, it keeps me entertained for hours at work. all the different games give me a variety of things to do

B00479SVBU|5.0|I've tried many of the lower end FM transmitters and they were all garbage with lots of static. This one looks nice, is easy to use and as important sounds great! It seems like there are a few features you 'need' the remote for but that in no way takes away from the function of this device. stop searching and just get this one: [[ASIN:B00479SVBU Soundfly AUX MP3 Player Car Fm Transmitter for SD Card, USB Stick, Mp3 Players (iPod, Zune, Sansa) with Remote Control]].
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|this is like the first one but you need to know in advance what the birds can do. just as addictive, great graphics frustrating if you don't figure out the sequence of events that solve the problem early. best advice is to learn from your mistakes and repeat what works. but don't underestimate a random frustration move.
B006C1DH92|1.0|I could not get it to download and it was very frustrating!  Now it is stuck on my Droid half way and will not go away!
B0063IH60K|5.0|i think this is a great game. the graphics are excellent. it feels like you are playing with a deck of cards. I would recommend it to everyone.

B002NWRMVS|5.0|Norah comes thru again with her wonderful vocals. Typical smokiness to her voice, love the new songs. She's just great.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|If you're like me, your faith in horror television went out the window 3 eps in to season 2 of The Walking Dead.  Then, like a beacon of horror in a sea of cop shows: American Horror Story.  Inspired, witty writing. Beautiful sets and plenty of bloody flashbacks.  Surprise after shocking, horrifying, disturbing surprise.  VERY spoiler sensitive, BTW.  You'll be doing yourself a profound disservice if you watch the eps out of order.<br /><br />Frances Conroy, Jessica Lange, Denis O'Hare, and Dylan McDermott's naked butt round out a very large and impressive cast.  I can't say enough good things about it.  If you're a horror fan, you've really got to see this.
B006C1DH92|5.0|This is a very addictive game and quite fun.  I love the two modes and it works great on my Kindle Fire.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|Would give it a higher score but still has ads that my kids can click on. please take out all the ads, even for other angry bird games.
0307959856|2.0|Pride and Prejudice is my favorite book.  I've read all of Austen's novels, including the unfinished works and juvenilia.  I have seen every movie adaptation of every one of the works, including Bridget Jones's Diary and Clueless.  I'm not a stickler about any of it.  Love it all.  I even thought Keira Knightly made a surprisingly appealing Elizabeth Bennet.  I've read many of the (uniformly awful) \\"sequels\\" and hated them for the usual reasons: They were either overly sexual (!), overly explanatory about the period, or they brought in coy references to world events or famous people.  Austen never wrote about sex, wouldn't have had to give her readers little lessons in Regency customs, and kept her world very, very tiny.  I just want someone to write an homage that stays true to those qualities!  I don't want Mr. Darcy suddenly becoming a vocal abolitionist or speaking up for feminism.  So I was very excited when I heard about this book.  P.D. James is a famous British author, in her nineties no less, and a lifelong Austen fan, so I hoped for the best.  Also, I love a good murder mystery.  I was very disappointed.  The mystery part of the story is really lame.  There's no subtlety, no finesse.  The hallmark of a good mystery is that when each clue is explained, you say to yourself, \\"Of course!\\"  But here, one of the most mysterious clues (having to do with initials) is explained away in the end by something the reader couldn't possibly have guessed.  The characters didn't ring true at all--Darcy is an emotional, insecure wreck.  She makes mistakes, referring to Mr. Collins as Mr. Bennet's nephew, when he was supposed to be his cousin, and she several times describes Colonel Fitzwilliam as being very handsome, whereas in the original he was described as having an open and pleasing, but not a handsome face.  Which is not a big deal, I guess.  A little disrespectful to be so careless, I think.  But also there's the gothic tone of the novel--all dark and stormy nights and mysterious apparitions and a courtroom denouement complete with last-minute confession.  Jane Austen wouldn't have written such nonsense.  She made fun of gothic novels!    Here's a short list of things that would bug a fan of the original:  She has Fitzwilliam make a joke about Darcy's \\"newfangled water closet\\" (Oh, come on!)  She specifies the names of the horses pulling the carriage (for no reason whatsoever)  She has Darcy, Alveston and Fitzwilliam discuss Mary Woolstoncraft's views on women's rights  She has the characters sympathetically discuss the servants, dwelling on their hopes and aspirations  She has the characters discuss/contemplate the French Revolution and the tyranny against the working classes that brought it about  She has the characters discuss Napoleon  Jane Austen never mentioned the war except to help move her little stories forward.  Her writing was apolitical.  She was of her own time, and didn't have, for God's sake, the perspective of a modern liberal westerner.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a modern liberal westerner.  And Jane Austen, had she been born two centuries later, would undoubtedly have been one too.  But let's keep her in her own time and enjoy her style, and not go messing it up with our newfangled ethos.  It's actually kind of insulting to put modern views and world perspective in the mouths of her characters.  It's a little like apologizing for what Jane Austen was not, instead of celebrating what she was.
0545265355|5.0|My wife and son are reading the set now. They are on the second book already. It has been a pleasure for me to listen to them discuss the story line, and where they each see the next book possible going. Great trilogy for early teens and adults.
1423113381|4.0|I am very impressed with this my first RR read.  RR gives life and personality to gods and goddesses thought to be long forgotten.  I like that they have character flaws.  I also like watching the Kane children grow into new understandings and the fact that they learn to trust each other even though they don't really know one another at the beginning of the story. The Egyptian descriptions in the back of the book would have been helpful to the very young reader if put at the beginning of the book.  I always check the back of the book for interesting lists and found that straight away but not all readers think to do that.  All in all I will be finishing this series.
B004A8ZWXS|5.0|WAR HORSE conjures up feelings I had when I first read BLACK BEAUTY years ago, the saga of a horse who went from owner to owner amid a series of mostly unhappy circumstances. The difference here is the background (World War I), the luscious farm scenes that start the tale, the colorful faces of the village folk, and at the center of the tale, an earnest and good-looking lad (Jeremy Irvine) who adopts the horse and must turn it into a plow horse so his family can retain their farm.<br /><br />And when the war comes, the grim scenes of battle offer a stark contrast to the sentimental scenes at the start, as the horse proves himself to be a fine specimen until he is caught in a barbed wire situation that requires the assistance of British and German soldiers to put aside the war while they free him from suffering and pain.<br /><br />The usual bombastic score that John Williams gave many of Spielberg's action films is missing here. Instead, there are delicate melodies played brilliantly on flute for the lighter moments and impressive richer sounds for the dramatic highlights. It's a lovely piece of craftsmanship.<br /><br />So is the film, which shows a high level of craftsmanship throughout, the settings and costumes realistic, the performances beyond reproach, and the sentimental happy ending so welcome after all the audience has been through with the brave war horse. Credit must go to Steven Spielberg for his detailed direction and to his cinematographer for the stunning camera work.<br /><br />By all means, one of the best Spielberg films to come along in a long time. Jeremy Irvine is perfectly cast in the leading role and all of the supporting players are well cast, particularly Emily Watson, David Thewlis, Peter Mullan, Neil Arestrup and Benedict Cumberbatch.<br /><br />Solid entertainment, it holds the interest throughout despite its length. Certainly one of the best films of 2011.
B0063GORYU|5.0|but.....wish you could change the card front. the current one is slightly difficult to stare at for long periods. otherwise, well made with no bugs.
1451627289|5.0|11/22/63 was a very exciting book, and like all Stephen King's book,I could not put it down until I had finished it.The story is very unusual and the thought of being able to go back and change a single act from the past is amazing thought out.The butterfly effect was a kick in the stomach to me and I did not see that coming. Loved it. Love Stephen King, and I think this would make a very good movie.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|I was a fan of Scotty from the beginning of American Idol. If your a Scotty McCreery fan this is definitely for you. He is such a talented artist and this album proves that. Such an amazing first album for him. Every song will have you singing along.

B001USHRCK|5.0|My 6 year old daughter got this set for Christmas even though she is half of the recommended age.  She has a number of other Lego Kingdoms and Creator sets as well -- I build them for her and then she takes over and \\"plays\\" with them as a kind of doll house along with the Lego mini figs.  This set is huge.  1601 pieces.  It took me around 6 hours to build with a lot of time spent looking for parts even though I had separated a good chunk of the blocks prior to staring assembly.  The tree I find to be rather hard to keep assembled -- the green leaves keep falling off with the slightest bump but it's a minor annoyance.  I'd like to find the large castle set for her but it's sold out everywhere.  This set is nice in that it has a bunch of individual blocks and not the large complete wall sections that a lot of the newer sets have.  I prefer having the blocks vs. the sections for later use when building custom houses and the like.
0451529065|5.0|The Origin of Species by Charles Darwin is amazingly readable, since it was published in 1859. Darwin lays a good foundation for the Origin of Species which is the basis for the established Theory of Evolution. His only flaw is his sentences are too long, but that's no impediment to a good read. --W.J. Braithwaite

B002HK9I04|5.0|So Trey Parker and Matt Stone are the kings. This movie is perfect in every way, and one of the great musicals of all time.   So I just upgraded from DVD and picked up the Blu Ray. Is it worth the upgrade? To me it was. Everything is brighter. I never realized how much texture there was on their clothes or on background stuff. I watch on a 60 inch screen so it was fun going back to the movie I used to watch on my 27 inch screen on DVD with my crappy stereo to seeing it on Blu Ray 1080p with lossless sound. Everything sounds crisper. It was fun!
B0013N3DSE|5.0|This Blu Ray edition of \\"Adventures of Robin Hood\\" may lack extras,but as one who prefers the main movie,I think this has to be one of the best value for money titles out there.  it looks great and should be there amongst everyones Blu ray collection. ErrolFlynn definetely was and stillis the best Robin Hood

0446547654|3.0|The Best of Me is the story of Amanda Collier and Dawson Cole.  Amanda was a pampered princess of their small Southern town and Dawson was from the wrong side of the tracks. Back in the 1980's, they were each other's first love.  After learning that Amanda was accepted to Duke, but her parents wouldn't pay for her to attend if she kept dating Dawson, Dawson broke up with her.  They wouldn't see each other again for twenty-five years.  Dawson was soon after involved in a tragic accident and Amanda moved on with her life with marriage and kids.  After the death of their mentor Tuck, they both end up back in Oriental North Carolina to say goodbye and rediscover each other.<br /><br />While I have enjoyed Sparks books in the past (especially The Wedding), I didn't think this was one of his best.  It was immensely readable and the action kept the plot moving, but the plot seemed like a rehash of previous Sparks novels.  The overall theme for me seemed to be even if you were in a tragic accident beyond your control and you spent your life trying to make up for it, it was never good enough.  That is more than a depressing message.  I also guessed the ending before the end and I didn't like the end.<br /><br />I never felt like I really liked Amanda or Dawson.  I didn't care as much about their love for each other as I should have.<br /><br /> I also didn't like how Amanda and Dawson broke up to begin with.  I guess I figure if you are that in love, you don't have to break up so that Mommy and Daddy can pay for you to go to college.  I thought that was more than a bit lame.  Maybe I am biased since I had to actually work and take out loans to pay for my entire college education myself.<br /><br />I am also usually against novels where there is an affair or leaving of a spouse and your children.  Yet in this case, Amanda has been unhappily married to alcoholic Frank for years.  Although they've gone to counseling and she's talked to Frank about the problem, things do not change.  I guess I'm all for keeping your family together, but when you have your kids living with an alcoholic, I'm not sure you are doing anyone any favors.<br /><br />Tuck was an important part of the book, but I didn't feel that you got to know him that well.  I think there should have been more Tuck.  I also couldn't wait to read the letters he left both Amanda and Dawson, but I thought they were a bit of a let-down when you actually got to read them.<br /><br />Overall, The Best of Me was readable, but I would skip it and read one of Sparks other much better novels such as The Wedding.<br /><br />This review was first published on my blog, Laura's Reviews.nge.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Thought I was a Springpad man, and didn't want to try Evernote. However, with Evernote's increased popularity, I decided to give it a shot. I haven't looked back since! I have Evernote on all my PC's and mobile devices, and use it to keep notes on all my stuff - work, video game stratagies, grocery lists, to do lists, general reminders - everything! If you have even the smallest feeling you might use Evernote, I strongly suggest you try it out. It sounds odd, but Evernote will change how you organize your life!

B000C8VE14|5.0|I don't know how you could be human and not love this bad @ss debut album. I guess if you like Oasis you're pretty far off the musical target anyway. Oasis was a horrible Beatles rip off. The energy in this band is mind-boggling and much better than the famed \\"Beatles\\" movement too. I don't want to have a BM right now but if you proceed to claim how important they use to be to some one then I'll puke. The fact is, if the Beatles didn't come along some other band would've promptly got that spot back then. Back to \\"The Arctic Monkeys\\" debut album which really deserves 6 stars but that extra star wasn't available. These guys are the \\"Real Deal\\" to all you playa haters! The truth feels sooooooooooooooooooooo good.  Happy New Year,  Common Sense

The corners are elastic, and meant to tightly hold your Kindle Fire in place which they do. Yes it is tight, that's how it works. This is NOT a sleeve you will take your Fire in and out of, it is a cover that you leave on.  Next, know that there is no magnetic closure here nor strap to hold the cover open. In my opinion it doesn't need either. When closed, the lid lies flat and looks just like a book. When open with the lid folded back, it is a comfortable fit in either left or right hands and easy to hold. When turned side-ways and laid down with the cover folded back it presents a gentle slope only. For the curious, there is no way to convert this to a stand.  The inside of this cover is a soft suede and has one pocket.  I received this as a gift but would have bought it anyway, well worth the price.
0399230033|5.0|When I first received this book for my baby boy, I was actually a little disappointed in how few words there were.  Well, my baby is now 13 months and this book is now one of his favorite books -- and mine.  I have realized just how fun it is telling my son the story in my own words.  The story is always a little different, depending on the day.  This book makes us both laugh when I read it to him, which is almost daily.  The pictures are terrific, with great detail.  My little boy now sits in his crib, turning the pages of this book, and says \\"goodnight\\" in his own little way.  This is a wondeful book.
B004K4AVAG|4.0|Of course taking media saturation aside,this is the first time I've actually sat down and listened to a Lady Gaga album. Never honestly paid her much attention. Didn't have to. Personally I feel her one awkward point is similar to that Madonna dealt with at the height of her career. Her whole presentation,creatively and image wise is about non conformity but at the same time the celebrity machine is working overtime in her case. Realizing that this same type of contradiction of approach worked wonders for David Bowie,Michael Jackson,Prince and of course \\"Madge\\" I'd thought I'd give this one a try. A lot of smart people I know with genuine musical tastes actually spoke quite highly of Lady Gaga. You'd really be amazed how,even in the age of internet just how important the right kind of word of mouth can be. Lady Gaga is,in fact a very self contained artist. A singer/songwriter/producer with a flair for the dramatic and for pure shock value,this quality which could easily deduct points for her creatively actually works very much in her favor. And it will also have an appealing to those,such as myself,looking to explore her music past mere surface value.<br /><br />  As pop compositions,all of these songs are actually very strong. Sometimes on songs such as \\"Marry The Night\\",\\"Judas\\",\\"Heavy Metal Lover\\" and the title song there's all too heavy a late 90's [[ASIN:B000002NJS Ray of Light]] period Madonna influence,in addition to the obvious rave/gay club thud Lady Gaga has made something of a trademark. I guess it's being called electropop. Some of that sameness in production is why I deduct one star in the review. However it all plays wonderfully on the club scene however. On \\"Government Hooker\\" there's more of a colder Eurodisco flavor to the production. \\"Americano\\" is one strong number here,incorporating a mixture of tango and Habanero dance rhythms in with the disco dance type music. \\"Bloody Mary\\" is my favorite on the album,a jam on the funkier side of new wave dealing with that delightfully decedent party scene.  \\"Scheibe\\" brings the German connection into it,again as with all these songs telling tales of social outsiders who are proudly \\"born that way\\". On \\"Hair\\" there's this retro wall of sound via E (as in electronic too lol) Street Band sound,appropriately featuring Clerence Clemons on sax. He's also featured on the more poppy \\"The Edge Of Glory\\".<br /><br />  \\"Bad Kids\\",\\"Heavy Metal Lover\\" and especially \\"Electric Chapel\\" with it's rock guitar intro have a somewhat cyberpunk edge to them. \\"You And I\\" is also a fascinating song-kind of a electronic country pop number. It all helps me realize the key to what Lady Gaga is doing with her music here. The filter she looks through is electro rave/dance music. But she brings a lot of the different musical influences that that she embraces into that as well. Musically eclectic artists exists. But they tend to separate their influences out from song to song. Lady Gaga looks into all of her music through that electronic dance filter. Sometimes it's even just outright that. So if your just not too into electronic production,this might not be for you. But for those who chose to hear beyond it to an artists intent,there's really a lot to admire and love about this. During the remainder of the year after this release Lady Gaga has been collaborating on duets with Tony Bennett that show her potential to be expanding her musical filter into another place as well. Listen to these inventive,often cabaret and tin pan alley influenced  compositions even outside the production context it's clear to see that Lady Gaga has more than enough potential to expand and improve on her music as time moves ahead.that delightfully decedent party scene.  \\"Scheibe\\" brings the German connection into it,again as with all these songs telling tales of social outsiders who are proudly \\"born that way\\".

1596432594|5.0|Written in Feynman's own words, this graphic treatment of the physicist's life is generally well done.  I think that those who might not have time to read a detailed book on physics should be able to get the gist of the history of quantum theory, and especially QED (Quantum Electrodynamics), as well as the development of the atomic bomb.  Feynman was, as he observed himself, a curious character who was ever tinkering, ever trying to find out more about how things were constructed.  He got involved not only with physics, but drumming, figure drawing and, toward the end of his life, with going to an obscure Soviet region called Tannu Tuva.  He never lived to see it, but died of cancer prior to getting the permission of the Soviet government.  He suffered several tragedies, including the death of his first wife from TB of the lymphatic system, but he never lost his sense of adventure or wonder.  His life is quite worth reading about and if the reader cannot read Feynman's own books, this is a good substitute.
B004KA9MQO|5.0|After being impressed with her entire personage from seeing her in 'Dreamgirls' on I honestly don't know what was keeping me away from Jennifer Hudson for so long. The important thing is that it finaly happened. After passing on this her sophmore albums for months after her release I decided to go for it on a holiday sale. An in all honesty? I am amazed by what I've heard. For years soul music has been looking to reconcille it's relationship with hip-hop. Either that or looking back to earlier styles. Featuring the help of people such as Alicia Keys,R.Kelly and Harvey Mason this album looks to a modern soul music free of hip-hop productions but using many of it's musical innovations to create a rather new sounding music. And we of course have a singer with a full on gospel wail of a vocal instrument Jennifer possess and her ability to interpret music to such a degree it instantly seems she wrote it....well you've got something very special out of the box.<br /><br />  All the music on this album is possessed of a vey epic flavor. It all comes out of the gospel tradition in these cases as well. On \\"No One Gonna Love You\\",\\"I Got This\\" and \\"Where You At\\" the piano is front and center,the rhythm is based more in percussion and rolling drum lines than beats and along with the title song \\"Why Is It So Hard\\",\\"Still Here\\" and \\"Feel Good\\" Jennifer's tales of passion,romance and dignity shine through even more so on these uptempo numbers. On the wonderful \\"Angel\\",the rousing \\"Everybody Needs Love\\" and \\"Don't Look Down\\" the tempo is still up but a streamlined,late 70's Quincy Jones style dance-funk/pop sound is emmerging. Something very well suited to Jennifers approach. The only song I have any complaints with is \\"Gone\\"-not because it isn't yet another great epic but because the electronic orchestration on the hook isn't very interesting,strong or original. Other than that,it's a superb soul/gospel type tune again.<br /><br />  The album concludes with \\"Believe\\",full on gospel with a live band including a choir and organ where Jennifer relates the story of knowing a friendly old man who died and the musings on that which we don't see. As opposed to pushing the gospel in ones face,the song offers for one to be philosophical on matters of life and death. And to face the possibility of more,or not. And that sums up the whole of this album. Jennifer Hudson,along with everyone involved in the musical process with her all welcome one into a friendly and above all soulful musical environment where it speaks directly to the listener. And while nobody necessarily had to love what they hear,they are at least invited to try. That sense of drawing in rather than pushing away really makes it easy for those new to her music to really get into it. As if I haven't been paying attention to her up until now,she's something I will be following even more closely as her music continues to move ahead.e band including a choir and organ where Jennifer relates the story of knowing a friendly old man who died and the musings on that which we don't see.

B0063IH60K|5.0|Good app. Enjoyable and a good waste of time at the airport. Ads are a little annoying but it is free.
B005ZUR724|1.0|Quoting an earlier poster:  \\"Many of those app stores do not require themselves to test the update before it is released. But amazon does (also apple does this too) l. So they are making sure that the update has no viruses to steal your identity. So instead of blaming gameloft you should be thanking amazon.\\"  The answer seems simple to me.  Before Gameloft pushes out an update which breaks the game for a very large number of their players they should IN ADVANCE get copies of the patch to Apple, Amazon and any of the other app stores who rightly perform due diligence testing of products before foisting them on their users.  When all this preliminary testing is done, they should negotiate a date and time when everybody can SIMULTANEOUSLY push out the update...  That way you don't aggravate your user community and distributors at the same time.  In my estimation the blame is with Gameloft for not organizing the update better.  Oh yeah...  And there is nothing wrong with rolling back to the old release when you first realize that there is a problem instead of having players locked out for three days (or more).
B006G2NVCA|5.0|A good film soundtrack sets the tone for a film.  This soundtrack to the Girl With The Dragon Tattoo does just that.  Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross provide diverse instrumental pieces.  The soundtrack begins with the track Hidden In Snow\\". This piece creates  a feeling of dread and tension in the film.  I love the percussion instrunents featured here. \\"What If We Could\\" is a lovely somber piece played on the piano.  \\"Pinned and Mounted\\" is an seductive piece of music with a powerful drum beat.  \\"Is Your Love Strong Enough\\" is a hauntingly beautiful song performed by a singer named Karen O. She also covers the Led Zeppelin classic \\"Immigrant Song\\". This song pumps me up. It is the kind of song that sends a jolt of energy through my body. \\"A Thousand Details\\" is a track with a intense tone. \\"An Itch\\" is another dramatic suspenseful piece of music.  I love the techno sound to this track. I'm not a musician.  I can't detect all the instruments in a piece, but \\"The Splinter\\" has a lovely eerie quality to it. \\"Perihelion\\" is a track that describes a spot on a planet that is closest the sun.  This tone of this track fills my head with feelings of wonder and fear.  It makes me think  about all the things floating around in the universe. Reznor and Ross deserve another Oscar for their superb work scoring this film.

B0034G4P4O|4.0|Intrepid newspaper man Tintin (Jamie Bell) and his faithful dog Snowy team up with a drunken sea captain (Andy Serkis) in a race with the dastardly Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine (Daniel Craig) to crack the mystery behind three scrolls hidden in model ships.  Will European audiences accept Hollywood's interpretation of a beloved character, and will US audiences line up for it?  Like so many Americans, I'm out of the loop on Tintin.  I was aware of the character's popularity in the soccer-loving part of the world and could have picked him out of a lineup, but that was about it.  Therefore, although I was hugely entertained by this film, I can't comment on its fidelity to the source material.  (However, the fact that Herge himself reportedly felt Spielberg was the only one who could do justice to his character bodes well on that count.)  The over-the-top exploits that sank \\"Crystal Skull\\" for so many people (swinging through the treetops with the monkeys, `nuff said) go down much easier in CGI, which straddles the line between the visceral impact of live action and the suspension of the laws of physics allowed by animation quite successfully here.  Tintin is a bit of a cypher--he looks like a teenager but he has his own apartment, everyone treats him like an adult, and his collection of news clippings is evidence of an eventful career.  The most interesting character is really the drunken Captain Haddock, whose arc takes him from a pathetic souse to something much greater.  I'll dock it one star because the action goes on perhaps just a hair too long, which makes the perfectly good denouement suffer by comparison.  I'm on board for any sequels, and I'm thinking that the original books might be fun to read with my young son...

B004132HZS|5.0|My wife and I saw the first 3 episodes on a trip to the UK last year. I especially was highly skeptical that an update of the Holmes stories would be good. The old tv series with Jeremy Brett shown on PBS often was so good and I dislike some modern updates like \\"The Tudors\\" which to me are little more than \\"Twilight\\" style series with teen heartthrobs projected back a few centuries. To my surprise, I loved \\"Sherlock!\\" Very well done, exciting, original with great character performances that believably project Holmes and Watson into the 21st century without losing the story's or characters original appeal. MUCH superior to the Robert Downey/Jude Law movies!

006091307X|2.0|OK, this is a satire, but I'm not sure of what.  Is it America's obsession with Communists under every bed ?  Is it of the Sixties---the age itself ? (but it was written in 1965).  Could it be a parody of Umberto Eco ?  (but he wrote in the `80s). Or of an obscure episode in a great issue of ZAP Komix ?  Hey, whatever's right, man.  Some say Pynchon is one of America's greatest writers, but on the basis of this book, I don't.  I'd say it's more like a case of the emperor has no clothes.  Admittedly, the writing is lush, even lyrical; the humor, especially the choice of names, made me laugh out loud repeatedly, but I like a novel with an understandable plot, some characters who are more than cartoons, and if a satire, then at least a remote sense that (unlike Kafka's intimate circle of friends) I didn't have to know Pynchon personally to understand the \\"real meaning\\".<br /><br />Oedipa Maas' ex-lover dies, leaving her the job of being executor of his will, but as she tries to do her duty, more and more oddities appear.  I can't give a straight account, because such a thing is impossible.  It's all a vague mass of plots, murders or possible murders, suicides, Nazis, postage stamps, mysterious symbols that turn out to be ubiquitous, 17th century plays, bars, secret organizations with their own postal service, and weird corporations.  Pynchon fans are going to hand me a heap of negative votes here.  But, read some of the other reviews.  If they intrigue you, give it a whirl.  As for me, I'm giving away the other Pynchon novels I have.  I'm outta here.

When it's on tv I try to catch it and I been wanting a DVD copy for a long time but the price just seemed too much for the quality. Well this comes along, a bluray/dvd combo pack for less than $9! So I hopped on it. And from when I put it in the bluray to the end of the movie I couldn't stop laughing. The quality of the movie is much above an upscale and the audio is more than acceptable. For $9, get it. Mel Brooks deserves the money.

B004EPYZT4|1.0|I had pretty low expectations going into this.  I'm a huge fan of the old Conan comics and the original Conan movie with Schwarzenegger and understand the inherent campiness.  He's a barbarian.  He drinks, he kills, he beds women.  He's the James Bond of the Bronze age.  But this movie had the most ridiculuous plot and horrible Syfy channel acting, it took campiness to a new low.  The movie starts with a shot of him in the womb, and his mother getting stabbed in the belly during a battle.  His father then cuts him out of her belly during the battle and has time to raise him in the air.  The rest of the movie is just as ridiculous.  There's some people made of sand, the rules of their abilities unexplained, there's a giant squid, there's a pure blood... it's just all crazy.  Just about everyone in the movie, while not exactly A listers, are better than this.  Jason Momoa did a much better job being Conan while playing Khal Drogo in \\"Game of Thrones\\".

I was pleasantly surprised that this was entertaining and it had its somewhat thrilling moments. However, I find this to be a one time watch, rent and return. There is nothing in the film that really sticks with you, it does rely heavily on instant gratification. The visuals are good and the acting is done well.<br /><br />Bottom line, fun for one night. Just rent and return for someone else, not exactly purchasing quality.
B002ROKQJM|4.0|Winner of Booker 2009. It probably starts a bit slow throughout the first half, although the characters are strong and clearly developed. An excellent story teller is at work here.   This is a must for you if you have been to India or are interested in things India. Other books have covered this topic before, the poor and disadvantaged of India, although this one does it with dry wit and wry observations from the eccentric and ambitious narrator that sets it apart. Sections of this novel are very much bitter-sweet and quite touching.     The strongest section in my opinion is the second half, so the novel finishes up and wraps up very strongly. Indeed. So I think the second half of this novel is well worth waiting for.   After reading this, I cannot but wonder how experts can predict that India (along with China) will be one of the future superpowers. Unfortunately, India has a lot of baggage within its age-old caste system, and by all reports it is as riddled with corruption and bribery as shown within this novel. I'd imagine India would have to substantially change how it has operated for many hundreds of years to become a First World. I suppose it is not impossible but I would have thought it is unlikely. On the other hand, China, which is mentioned many times throughout the novel, would have to be an entirely different proposition.
B006O5XYWG|4.0|Rise of The Planet of the Apes turned out to be a fun and at times thrilling film to watch. The visuals are very well done and the acting is on point. It was much better than the last apes remake that made me want to fall asleep 10 minutes into it. The story line is developed smartly in this one, so it appeals to those of us who like to delve a little into what is actually going on. At times, you cant help but side with the apes, and I know for those who are fans of the originals, we don't want to do that. A lot is revealed here, focusing on Caesar, who is supposed to be the son of Cornelius and Zira, who basically is raised by a scientist after his rescue from a \\"Big Pharma\\" style drug corporation. He is super intelligent and eventually is locked up in a primate shelter where he gains his following as the leader of the soon to be ape revolution.<br /><br />This is a film that fans may want to consider purchasing instead of renting, it is re-watchable and the visuals are good enough for that Blu-Ray you just got for Christmas. Don't miss out, if Hollywood stays on track with this one, we may see more pleasing sequels.

As to the complaints I have seen from many reviewers about its said fragility, I am pleased to report the epic has withstood the rigors of cross-country shipping and hours of play so far. My son loves it and the adults in the family love it too! I highly recommend you give it a spin or more precisely, hundreds of spins!

032180354X|4.0|This book does a good job in providing detailed information on how a particular shot was achieved.  The target audience is likely beginning \\"strobists\\" looking for inspiration and ideas.  I was not familiar with Dustin Diaz prior to this purchase (the book popped up in my recommendations based on my other purchases); but apparently giving the detail behind the shot is his \\"thing\\".  That's why I bought it and I will say the information seems reasonably complete.  I haven't yet had time to try to recreate any of the shots for accuracy, but the settings all seem believable.  He has two very basic and very short chapters on 1) gear and 2) inverse square law.  Probably could have skipped them all together; but they are so short they don't really get in the way.  The gear chapter may be helpful if you are very new to this.  Chapter 3 is the rest of the book.  On the left facing page is the finished shot and the right facing page contains the pull back/set up shot.  He gives distances, settings, apertures, lenses, etc. etc.  Like I said, a pretty complete recipe.  As far as the images themselves, some are pretty cool and some are just so-so. Probably the most compelling shot is on the cover (and I like it).  Interestingly enough, I liked some of the pull back shots better than the finished image. Warning: If you are not a fan of tilted horizons, you might not like this book.  I counted at least 15 tilted shots out of about 60.  Picky I know; but it does bug some people.  Some of the shots seem a little soft (for instance Dad's face is a little soft on page 90...but he shot a 5 person stack at F/2 so maybe he wanted that).  Anyway, for $14-$15 I think this book is worth it.  I can't say I learned a great deal from it; but I think some of the shots may inspire me to try a few different things and for that I think it is worth it.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|This was a gift for my teenage daughter and she loved it! She started watching the show last season and had to miss some episodes during the season, for the last 2 days she has had a \\"Pretty Little Liars\\" marathon so she can be caught up before the new season starts!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A very easy read that you simply cannot put down.  I suggest not starting it just prior to going to bed because before you know it, it will be time to get up and you will not have put down the book. Can't wait to read the next novel in the series!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I would buy this game again in a heartbeat!  Loads of fun.  Looks great on my Kindle fire.    Enjoyable, terrific graphics.  Overall a very nice version of Mahjong with a story plot.  Neat!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I have seen a lot of Christian movies with poor acting, low production budgets that just could not hold a light up to standard movies today. This movie is NOT it. My husband is extremely critical of corny movies with bad dialogue and I found both he and I tearing up at some of the scenes. Very moving, thought provoking and makes you want to be a better person, even if you are not a parent, or Christian.
B001RNO7BW|5.0|Quite simply, this is a fantastic shoe I would highly recommend.  It wears incredibly comfortable right out of the box and I put them to the test immediately on a recent trip where I did a LOT of walking over a two week period.  The waterproof worked like a champ in the rain (and a few puddles) leaving my feet dry and warm.  The show is also quite stable and the material breathes very well.  I have a wide foot at the toe and a narrow foot at the heel, so I generally wear Keens, but the Teva fit perfectly.  Great show and it looks great too.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Fantastic for work, meeting notes, group projects, and really anything that has to do with collaboration. Love the sharing feature! Great app!
B005CA4SJW|5.0|I didn't even know that a zombie show was on TV until recently when a friend of mine suggest i give it a try...and im glad i did!!  This was another pleasant surprise for me and i thought i would review it so that the  rest of the living dead fans know that this is NOT just another cheesy zombie film. This is serious... and it was beautifully done!!!..The acting is good, cinematography is just perfect and those zombies are really great..they actually  have a really serious and creepy looks!!  Far more realistic than lots of zombies in other movies......<br /><br />It is my 3rd movie i watched from director Frank Darabont, he also directed the \\"The Shawshank Redemption , The green Mile and The Mist by Stephen king. The walking Dead will be another strong addition to his work!!! The movies as a really apocalyptic atmosphere as the zombies are everywhere and a group of survivors will have to quickly get organized if they wanna survive...pretty much everyone is dead or gone and this epic battle to survive will finally bring them to understand what really caused all this and why..........<br /><br />If you like zombie movies then you owe it to yourself to give it a shot!!  This is really good and i cant wait to get my hands on the 2nd season, i know its on TV right now but i would rather have the whole thing with me when i start it cause i sometimes like to watch more than one episode without having to wait for the next week......im sure you'll feel the same way after watching the 1st episode!!!<br /><br />ENJOY!!!!
1612680003|4.0|This book is timeless in that its principles and ideas can be applied universally. However, there is something that I find troubling about some of his teachings. On one hand he states that he does not advocate debt, but on the other hand, he seems to advocate borrowing money to take advantage of financial opportunities. All of his examples in this book that involve real estate seem to include an implied message of taking on debt. Perhaps I missed something, but that is how I read the examples. I do believe that the overall message is worth reading and it is important to increase your financial IQ. This is a quick read; thus, I recommend it.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I like this app for the tap function. However, the game is very difficult and does show you useful hints.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Blessed if I can see how this movie lost out to The Hurt Locker, come the Oscars. The CGI is superb, though there are a few holes in the plot (if you own the orbitals, why in heaven's name fight an infantry action?  A single 100 tonne lump of rock dropped out of orbit onto your target pretty well ends the the argument) and the stereotyping is heavy handed.  But it was a fun movie to watch, with plenty of oooo's and ah's for the virtual world created.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I LOVED  READING THIS BOOK - THE STORY HAS A LITTLE SI-FI, HISTORY, LOVE CONNECTION AND MYSTERY.  I DIDN'T WANT TO PUT THE BOOK DOWN AND DID GET IT READ IN JUST A FEW DAYS BY ONLY READING IT BEFORE BED.

0385534639|3.0|First off, I want to acknowledge that the Night Circus is a visually stunning novel. I'm hard-pressed to think of anything else I've read in the past few years that gives such a world building description that the author does here. It's beautiful and lyrical prose that allows the reader to taste every morsel of food and see ever thing the viewer is seeing. In short, spectacular descriptions.   There are spoilers below, so stop if you don't want to know more.  And the opening hooked me. After reading the sample chapter, I immediately picked up the book.It's a fantastic setup. Two age old magicians with differing philosophies using the best students they can find to have a duel they're far too young to understand. Great stuff. Loved the set up.   The problem I had, is that the rest of it felt like it never really went anywhere after that. Although the initial setup is brilliant, there's only so many times I can enjoy the description of a circus act or a meal or an outfit. The story is meant to be a Romeo and Juliet story, but there, the leads overcome massive hurdles in their struggle to be together. Here, not so much.   The lead characters were the least interesting element of the story. They felt largely wooden and quite honestly, I couldn't understand why Celia wanted to be with Marco other than that the author wanted them to be together.   And after being set up by the world's two great magiciians to have this duel, they never really do anything about it. They never really face down the two men who trapped them in this position to begin with. That's just disappointing.  There were great moments, but ultimately, this felt a lot like cotton candy. Great to taste, but not much substance underneath.
B005HS00V4|4.0|\\"New Blood - Live in London\\" captures Peter Gabriel's most recent experiment in a career distinguished for experimentation.  Built on the \\"Scratch my Back\\" concept where he covered other artists' songs with an orchestral backing, this show will enthrall staunch Gabriel fans.    The setlist begins with a heavy dose of the \\"Scratch my Back\\" covers resulting in mixed results.  Regina Spektor's \\"Apres Moi\\" and a playful take on The Magnetic Fields' \\"The Book of Love\\" are strong tracks, but overall, this section of the show feels like a so-so opening act.  You can tell the audience at the Hammersmith had been ready to pounce on the Gabriel material once those tracks start up in earnest.    The often-minimalized orchestral treatment definitely leads to a much more down-tempo vibe for these familiar tracks.  This gives new emotional dimension and power to songs such as \\"Signal to Noise\\", \\"Mercy Street\\" and \\"Red Rain\\".  However, as the setlist progresses, monotony threatens to set in.  You'll breathe a bit easier when the jubilant take on \\"Solsbury Hill\\" comes up (and even the players seem to feel the same).    The video (yes, 1080i video) quality is crisp in this blu-ray release.  Cinematography was up and down - there were several tracks where I wished that the director had matched the less-is-more theme of the performance itself.  This was most evident in the opener \\"Intruder\\" where hyper-quick cuts from security monitors were a corny distraction.  Fortunately, the rest of the presentation is more reserved.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix is well done - clear and distinct as a performance such as this should be.    Overall, the \\"New Blood - Live in London\\" blu-ray is a great chronicle easily recommended for Gabriel's career fans.
B005NF2UE6|2.0|I've been a big nickleback fan for years, but this album is simply weak!  This started with Dark horse and has continud with this one.  Maybe three descent songs on this album, save your money and listen to the old albums.

B000PKX2KA|5.0|This USB GPS was required for marine navigation program.  After loading supplied drivers, even worked with Windows 7.  I had been using an older USB GPS with Windows 2000/XP but wouldn't work with Windows 7 (couldn't obtain drivers) so it had to be replaced.  This GPS finds satellites and locks on very quickly.  Highly recommended.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game app is fun I have it on both my kindle and my ipod touch I love it its awesome
B003Y5H5FG|4.0|While the original version is one of my favorite 80s vampire flicks, you have to appreciate this decent remake because it comes at a perfect time when what we needed from a vampire film today was a good \\"fright.\\"  There are no lovable shiny vampires here!<br /><br />Colin Farrell is awesome as the sexy, alluring, and dangerous Jerry. Anton Yelchin is perfect as the geeky hero Charley who gets the girl in the end. Toni Collette, from United States of Tara, does a great job as Charley's mom. I loved seeing Christopher Charles Mintz-Plasse as the friend, Ed.  Fans will recognized him from movies Superbad and Role Models. He plays the same type of geek here as he often has, but gets to shine as a big bad vampire in the end.  And fans of the original will certainly recognize Chris Sarandon from the original who makes a cameo appearance.<br /><br />With its eerie music and \\"bump in the night\\" moments to set the tone and make you jump, the movie holds true to the original more than I expected. Special effects were decent and scary as well. Overall, it's a fun teen flick that gives back what vampire films have definitely been missing this decade.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|I have tried to download angry birds ad free about 15times. each time I try, It says there was an error in purchasing. it also says click here for suggestions.  it never gives me anything. helpful.
B005ZUR724|5.0|Gameloft and o&amp;c can't be blamed for amazon not updating the client.  Bashing the game on Amazon's store just to whine will only confuse future users once the issue is resolved.  If you have played any online game before from Battlefield to WoW, you should be used to jot being able to play from time to time.  These things happen and are usually resolved within days.  I swear, the people who couldn't play dcuo on ps3 for a month did less complaining.
0143038419|3.0|I read this book on vacation - read like a tasty desert.  I liked it as a travel journal more than for the authors personal revelations about life and relationships.  The author seemed a bit spoiled and over indulged.  I loved her descriptions of her travels, what she ate and her yoga revelations.  Been to Italy and India, not Bali but now I want to go. Probably closer to 3.5 stars.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|This is an excellent product.  I use it on my Nano that's attached to a watchband. Looks nice, fits securely in the Nano and does not interfere with shirt/coat sleeves.  Easy to pair.
B000IJ79UW|5.0|Got this four disk set on Amazon at a great sale price, so it was a bargain. Contains the original and extended version of Superman. Lots of extras on the special features disk including screen tests by different actresses for the role of Lois Lane and alternate music tracks.
0385534639|5.0|I wish I could simply review this novel with two words: \\"simply magical\\".  No two other words I think could better define the story that surrounds The Night Circus.  I'll warn you that once you read it you will be extremely sad that The Night Circus is not real.  Summit Entertainment has bought the rights to the movie and if they can bring this film to life I'll be ecstatic.<br /><br />Le Cirque des Rêves arrives without warning and is only open from dawn to twilight.  The whole circus revolves around a black and white theme but the acts, talents, and tents bring all the color that is needed. Imagine a tent filled with what looks like clouds that allows one to bounce to and from them. Or a tent with mirrors upon mirrors but each one shows a different scene. Or a tent with magicians so phenomenal that they make you want to believe in magic.<br /><br />Unbeknownst to circus goers and to the majority of the circus performers the circus has a more sinister origin.  It was created so that two magicians could compete against one another in a deadly magical battle.  Celia and Marco have entered this deadly battle where neither one of them fully understood the consequences. It is unknown what will happen to the circus and everyone they love that performs within it once one the magicians lose.  Celia and Marco decide to try and find a way to fight for themselves and the circus.<br /><br />The Night Circus has a structure that takes a bit of getting use to.  The point of view jumps between several characters and between several time periods, but once you become immersed in the story line it no longer matters.  It wouldn't make sense for the book to be laid out on a liner time line, I think it would have detracted from the over all sense of magic that the book alludes.  I highly recommend The Night Circus.
B003E6K1VK|4.0|I just received this in the mail after ordering it from Amazon.  There simply isn't anything we can plug it into that isn't instantly and magically turbocharged with incredible sound.  Car stereo, phones, computers, mp3 players.  Plug it in and its like a huge receiver just got connected.  But the length and width makes it no bigger than a playing card.  It truly is amazing.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great game.  Easy to use.  This was a free app but I would have been happy to pay for this game.
0756404746|5.0|Okay, I have to say, Patrick Rothfuss is quite possibly the best fantasy writer--not author, mind--I have ever read.  His story isn't the best I've read, but in terms of style and technical ability, I don't think there's anything in the fantasy world like it.  Name of the Wind is different from most other fantasy novels in that it is told from a first-person narrative.  The book is Kvothe, the main character, telling his story to a scribe who has come to him in the midst of some supernatural disturbances in the world.  This different technique made the story flow so much better--no breaks for other characters' points of view--while also creating a sort of suspenseful tension/interest between Kvothe's backstory and the supernatural events happening while he narrates.  The tension between the two makes both more intriguing.  Besides this different storytelling style, Rothfuss is just a plain old great storyteller.  I was instantly sucked in and absorbed in the story that managed to be completely believable despite being a fantasy novel; I was reminded of science fiction, at times.  There are, however, some criticisms I have:  1) The book has very little magic in it, relative to most fantasy novels.  This isn't really a bad thing, but I WAS expecting a fantasy novel.  2) The amount of actual movement the plot makes = 0.  Yup.  The book is basically a young-ish man narrating his crazy/eventful/important life from his childhood until his first couple years at the university.  He doesn't even come close to finishing his narrative (I assume he won't be done until the third book, as he says he will tell the storyteller his story in three days, and this is the first), the main point of his childhood--finding out who the beings were that killed his parents--never resolves in the narrative, and the whole book is basically an introduction.  Despite these shortcomings, the storytelling is, as I said, incredible.  You won't care about the lack of actual progress or the scanty amount of magic in the book, because you will be completely engrossed in the story.  And because of the excellent style and execution, anyone (even literary snobs who usually hate fantasy) will find this book amazing.  Read this book, but don't expect your typical fantasy novel.
0399142533|5.0|I stumbled upon this in paperback in a dusty used book store. The first paragraph pulled me in and I was a Lee Child fan from then on. I devour his books as soon as they come out and NEVER lend them. I found this hardcover and now, maybe, I'll lend out my paperback copy....maybe. Jack Reacher, the main character, is the perfect man, strong, tough, kind, and he knows when to get the h--- out of Dodge. Lee Childs books are the only ones I never pass on to book drives. Sorry guys, go buy your own, you won't be disappointed.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|I admit that I was dis-swayed by the number of negative reviews early on (I had pre-ordered this case in November but cancelled) - I wish that I had purchased it much earlier! This is a very nice case! It's basically a shell with a cover that folds over to add screen protection. I wanted this for travelling since I didn't want a big bulky case and this one fits perfectly. I chose the white version and it looks very nice; it also has a grippy coating on the case part with a soft cover portion for the screen. The stand feature works well enough when you place it on a flat surface, but I always hold mine so I don't really use the stand feature. I do recommend this great little case if you don't want added bulk to your fabulous Kindle Fire!
0385344325|4.0|The latest in the Jack Reacher series. Somewhat different as it actually the beginning of Jack Reacher's story. It goes back in time to explain how Reacher became what he is. A good book.
B005ZUR724|1.0|been playing this game for a while now and then I am told I need an update that I cant get for my kindle. I even uninstalled and redownloaded but no luck. let's get this problem fixed
B0055QYKQO|5.0|I purchased my Gigabyte Motherboard directly from Amazon because (1) I have always been impressed their excellent customer pre- and post-sales customer care, (2) I know that they only sell quality products, and (3) I was buying a type of product that is associated with higher than usual risks for failure during installation and testing. I had already experienced the failure of a similar product from an on-line competitor of Amazon and was just tired of waiting for RMAs and all the associated hassles. Selling on the Internet is not about price. It is about service. Amazon does that. They help mitigate those risky buys by providing their well-known services and by only selling quality products. In my specific case, I purchased a Gigabyte GA-990FXA-UD3 Ultra Durable Motherboard.  This motherboard just oozes of well-thoughtout design and quality manufacturing. I've had it installed and fully tested for almost one month with no bugs, flaws or gliches. It has worked superbly since the moment I connected the power and turned it on. I've upgraded the RAM from 8Gbs to 16 Gbs, upgraded the video card, and the power supply in the interim period of ownership without a single hiccup. This motherboard just works, runs as designed, and provides me the confidence that the technology I bought was worth every cent I spent, and that it is backed up by Amazon's excellent post sales service.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Until this book I hadn't finished a Stephen King book in years ... I loved his early books, grew away from them as I got older, and the last time I tried to return to them I didn't enjoy the books.  I just couldn't get into them.  When I saw the positive reviews for this book I figured I'd give King another try, and I'm glad I did.  This was an excellent, well-written story.  I enjoyed it completely.
1400064287|5.0|I am not a marketer, an entrepreneur, or an advertiser. I am an aspiring engineer/scientist but that is besides the point.  This book is a MUST read for everyone. Who doesn't need to effectively articulate an idea to someone else?

B0054JZC6E|3.0|On the upside, the games are fun, the price is good, and there are 101games! But there is always that world famous catch. On the downside the games are addictive so you will have the urge to keep playing to unlock more games. You say that's not all bad. But they want you to give up so you will buy points with real money. Also,  they want you to see the adds.
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|The book explains the economic situation vis a vis the current technological state quite effectively.  The book isn't terribly long and it moves at a good pace.  Highly recommended reading for today.
B00003CXB6|1.0|Reading Jurassic Park and The Lost World by Michael Crichton are an amazing treat. The original movie actually followed the written novel to a large extent. The Lost World does not, and was a  major disappointment. Don't waste your money, buy the book. If you must have the movie, barter for it at a yard sale.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The game was very enjoyable game that makes a few changes that improve the gaming experience. I liked it quite s bit more than I expected.

B000LC55F2|5.0|Before watching this, I had no idea it was Christopher Nolan, and only really found out when the credits rolled. Ironically the first thought that popped in my head was \\"Wow - that was the best film I've seen since... Inception!\\"<br /><br />The truth is that this DVD is every bit the equal of its peers, if judged without preconceptions.<br />Just as with [[ASIN:B004FHCH96 Memento]], it has intelligent use of the timeline.<br />Just as with [[ASIN:B000PC6A3E Batman Begins]], it sees Christian Bale at his peerless best, rather than [[ASIN:B002RVCD0U his worst]].<br />And just as with [[ASIN:B002ZG981E Inception]], this film is the intelligent, well-directed brain candy that Christopher Nolan does best.<br /><br />A word or two about the plot, the story follows two rival magicians who are ruthlessly trying to outdo the other in order to be the best magician in London. Although recommended by a magician friend, you don't need any knowledge about magic, and the performances of Michael , David Bowie and the two leads more than outdo any magical pretensions.<br /><br />So if you want to see another Christopher Nolan film that really rewards the viewer, there are few better films than this one.<br />Alternatively, if you've never heard of him, then know that this is a film that, for a change, gets the plot and dialogue right, bringing home to you the magic of the movies.
0811876373|1.0|Cute book, but upon opening up the book, the inside pages are upside down.  Not only upside down, but backwards as well.  As soon as possible, it's going back.
B0057O6IDW|5.0|Ever seen Sapphire and Steel?  This could be their film!  Love it, so atmospheric, horrible deaths, weird stuff going on.  It kinda makes sense but not - and that doesn't matter one bit.

B005ZUR724|5.0|I have only played a little bit, but what I have has been a blast.  This game looks like it will keep me entertained for a long while and will be interested in seeing it grow with time.  It almost directly mirrors WoW, which isn't a bad thing.  Although this is a scaled back version of a regular MMO.

B001DL14HI|5.0|Metallica's latest album Death Magnetic hasn't disappoint me so far since their release of their previous album has alienate me and many fans due to unsophisticated texture of all songs. This album takes me back to the past obsession of the band that I love for many years.
B00177YA1K|1.0|I recieved the product on time when I ordered it from GoHastings. I put the DVD away until Christmas when my son opened it. He put it in the DVD player and it froze up at the menu. I took it out and noticed a crack in the disc. I contacted the seller and they said since it has been more than 30 days, there was nothing that could be done. I will not be ordering from them anymore.
B000038A5X|5.0|It is extremely difficult to find this album in brand new condition. Led Zeppelin 2 has taken the band to a further and deeper attraction of most rock listeners and lovers back in the 1970s and can still be felt now. It is highly recommended for any contemporary rock lovers that have never experienced the true sound of the classic rock.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this book...I was so in to it that at the end, I immediately came on here and bought the next 2 books in the series, despite bad reviews about the 3rd book. At an average of $6 a book for my iphone, it's money well spent to me.    I keep forgetting that these are just \\"kids\\" in this book - because their age isn't the point of the book, yes it's disturbing beut that's the society these people live in. These \\"kids\\" are wayyyy more mature for their age then a normal 12-16 y/o would be nowadays...They already have to fend for themselves and what not, it's not like they're taking YOUR kids and forcing them to fight - it's a whole different world - and yeah it's WRONG - but that's the POINT - that whoever is in power will do what they please and be as outrageous as they want to be JUST because they CAN.  I don't know if it is a good book for kids, I honestly didn't think it was scary, gorey or violent compared to what some people/reviews made me think but I do know that I absolutely loved it.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I was very pleased that my order of several copies of this CD arrived quickly.  The quality of the Christmas music is \\"superb\\".  If was the most popular item in stockings for my friends.
0525423281|4.0|Stephanie Perkins. She makes me feel young again. Not in an unrealistic and manipulated way - but a 'this is actually the way it feels to be a teenager'. Her characters are real and unique, balancing humor, sexual tension and the honest mess that is the process of adolescence. You like her characters and want only the best for them, even though they're not perfect. While Lola and Cricket are the undeniable heroine and hero, even the supporting characters are as delightful. Like 'Anna and the French Kiss', Lola explores the monumental day in and day out of being a teenager. Without relying on vampires or werewolves to convey conflict.<br /> Sheer delight! Looking forward to the next one. :)
1451627289|5.0|I don't go for the Stephen King horror books so I was happy to see this one come out.  I read it in a day so I guess you could call it a page turner.  The buildup of suspense was gratifying.  The characters believable.  The ending remarkable.  One thing to note (Mr King..or editors)in 1962 there was no NFC football to bet on.  It was NFL and AFL.  You might want to make that correction before the paperback is issued.
1451648537|4.0|The \\"Steve Jobs\\" biography is not just the story of a very successful man; it is actually a compendium of ideas (Steve's) about what life is all about and how us mortals should approach to it. As you read throw the pages Isaacson wrote it unveils insight on how a \\"genius\\" mind works, and the potential that is hidden in the inner layers of our consciousness. I really recommend the book not just for the historical references but most importantly because it invites to reflection and self awareness.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|This is a great Tarantino film, but kids, don't watch this for the history. It's no history flick, but an entirely re-imagined take on WW2, with a completely different ending. Divided into five chapters, each one is filled with tension that finally explodes so fast you barely have time to decipher it. This, of course, will remind people of the \\"Kill Bill\\" films. So be it. There 's a lot of unsavory violence as we watch Nazis being pulped with a baseball bat, and bodies being riddled with bullets. Brad Pitt is far from the lone star here, though his role is less central than credits make it appear. A fantasy movie. Great watch.
B00000427L|5.0|Rachmaninov: Piano Concertos Nos. 1 - 4 is a 1972 Decca Record recording starring pianist Andr&eacute; Previn. Vladimir Ashkenazy leads the London Symphony Orchestra. Decca has written the music notes which are very well-written and informative. The performance of Andr&eacute; Previn is amazing to say the least. Full of life and one feels that he truly understands the music of Rachmaninov. A performance for the ages. Highly recommended. 5/5.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I don't understand why so many people gave this a 1/5 star review... that is ridiculous. This collection is AMAZING. Yes, there have been some changes made that not everyone agrees with, BUT those people knew this months in advance and did not have to purchase this. The quality of this film and the audio are amazing. This is the blu-ray Star Wars I have been waiting for, for years in a perfect form. Yes, I love the theatrical version, and it would be nice to have it in blu-ray, but come on, it's 2012... move on people. Keep a VCR and watch your copy on VHS. If not, it's not difficult to find and it's still pretty cheap somehow. Again, this is Star Wars in blu-ray with amazing video, audio, and extras... you get what you pay for. Life comes with changes.
1401223176|4.0|Book was clearly new but has a dent in one corner on front and back side. Was a little bummed.
B004J3QACQ|4.0|I bought this set as a gift and the person loved it!! It's a good addition to any blues collector, particularly If you know they already own a lot of music. The set shipped quickly. Great gift idea and such a reasonable price!
B002RBZ13Q|3.0|Got Blu-ray version of this for Xmas 2011. Whole family likes the killers CD's so thought this would good. The video is good, sharp and nice camera angles. Gives one a good idea of the high energy concert this band delivers. Unfortunately the audio track is lackluster. Biggest issue we had is with stadium echo (present on every audio option of disk). This is unnecessary & distracting. Also bass is weak and drum cymbals not best.  Sounds like it was produced using mics located offstage as opposed to direct feed, doubt this was so, but why else should there be echo?
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love it! so many translations and very easy to access, navigate, and go through. love that its free ofcourse and that in a touch of a button I can access my Bible. its easy and I think its great how it can read to you.
B005K17RU0|3.0|it works pretty good and does tell mostly correct weather. I use it frequently. it is pretty accurate and I enjoy using it.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|I was never interested in the original Planet of the Apes movies but this one was fantastic.  It made me really want to watch the originals.  This is a great movie.  Also, it arrived promptly from this seller and in mint condition.
0545265355|5.0|I bought these books after they were recommended to me by many people, all adults. I was skepticle, but when I started I could not put it down. I finished all three books in less than a week and started rereading them!  Highly recommend!
B0060ZJ74O|3.0|Baseball FANS, you think this is the film you want? you may be wrong, its all talking with no-to-little baseball...  This film has been in talks since quite a while, after watching it I can only say that this film is good no-doubt but nothing great about it.  Simple story, good screenplay and strong performance. I felt like I was watching a B-version of \\"Miracle\\". Wherein Miracle was a great story, with equally weighted screen space for all the actors, Moneyball talks about Brad Pitt and Brad Pitt alone. Not for one second does the camera go away from him, which is a treat for Pitt fans but nonetheless, if you consider the film as a whole it will be just good. I don't understand what is with the critics and Pitt, but they go all 'Gaga' when someone says his name. He is very good in the film, but mind you not great nor is it any groundbreaking performance. The film revolves around Brad Pitt and the film has no possible spoilers, the baseball matches aren't shown, just a quick transition from one match to another. Never in the film was I intrigued or totally involved as it has no substance. I'd rather buy a better film like \\"Warrior\\" (another highly underrated and neglected film which is a triumph for real) again than buy 'Moneyball' and waste my money on a stupid ball game (too cheesy? :P )
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|With delight, I've discovered that this CD captures all of my moods. Traditional celtic instruments are beautifully arranged w/ Loreena's haunting voice. Always sounds fresh and uplifting no matter the number of replays.
B005VT42BS|5.0|has all the network commands a small network admin usually needs with pre-built actions. no command prompt necessary. Flawless and very useful so far. works great on kindle fire
B0036OS3Q0|4.0|I like these boots. I bought them for the purpose of keeping my feet warm this winter. My only complaint is that they are narrow. I don't have particularly wide feet but these boots definitely hug my feet making it difficult to just slide these puppies on and off. Some effort is involved in getting your feet in but once they are on and you are walking around you'd hardly notice it. These definitely run small. I ordered a half size up and they still are a little snug. I wonder if I should have ordered 2 sizes up. I wear them only indoors so hard to say what the outside performance is. Overall comfortable and warm. Definitely lightweight as many people have mentioned. If I had to do it all over again I'm not so sure I'd choose these again but for now I'm satisfied.
B0029ATTAQ|5.0|This movie attempts to follow the original story created by George Orwell and as such does an excellent job. The costumes, the graphics, the visuals produced by the telescreens, the music, the overall decrepit appearance of everything, it's all true to the novel Orwell wrote. The casting was very good, with an excellent performance by Sir Richard Burton. The only weakness in this movie is that it is SO true to the book that it might be a little hard to follow in places without prior knowledge of the story.
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|I bought a Kindle Fire last month. It was a great product. This \\"cover\\" cost me $ 30.00. But the only problem is that the side that is covering the Kindle Fire is the worst part. It stick too many dust and dirty thing. I hate this part, but I like the \\"outside\\"
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I had this version for my ipod and my computer and I like this version the best. it has a lot more levels and having the bigger screen helps a lot! if you have never played angry birds I would definitely recommend it!
1400049628|4.0|Gave as a gift for Christmas. They read it in 2 days. Said there was interesting information in it and all were quoted from studies done.
B006C1DH92|5.0|puss voice is really annoying and creepy but you can silence all the sounds so its alright. but its the same concept as fruit ninja. I got it for free so it was worth the download. it tries to mix things up by adding &quot;acts&quot;  but I would recommend it!
B005ZUR724|1.0|Until a viable update is available this diamond in the rough gets 1 star from me. And I'm a hardcore female rpger.
B005HSL626|5.0|this game is really simple. you chop fruit that's thrown in the air. but the feeling of unlocking more blades and backgrounds is.wonderful. and beating your high score. definitely give it a try. but WARNING YOU MIGHT GET ADDICTED.
B000AYEL6U|3.0|I thought it disappointing.  At any rate, characterization here is minimal.  I found myself losing interest in the characters, as they're so poorly developed.  I didn't finish watching the miniseries.   I haven't read the book (though it's now on my list of books I want to read) but my daughter-in-law has.  She says this adaptation changes the original story pretty radically. It sounds like the people who made this novel into a movie took all the charm out of it by assuming modern viewers wouldn't understand a woman who couldn't love a man because he wasn't a \\"gentleman\\".  Of course, it is the historically accurate details that make novels like these so wonderful--such as the BBC's \\"Cranford\\" (2007), which is another E Gaskill novel adapted for television.  I had hoped this would be like \\"Cranford\\", but it is nothing like that quality.  Or, like the adaptations from the Jane Austen novels, which are filled with references to beliefs and behavior that are now archaic, but since the adaptations are true to the novel, the novel's great truths come through.
B006JCC1GO|1.0|This app has horrible lag and you can only do 1note at a time!!!! I gave it one star because it was free. if you want a good free piano find ''little piano''  that is a great game unlike this one.
B002ZG976U|4.0|My wife and I have watched this show on a Dish Movie Channel.  We found the show very good so I purchased one from Amazon to give to our daughter for a Christmas present.  She was thrilled to get it and said it was one that she had thought about buying for herself.  Myself, I didn't know much about Christina Aquilera, but I have really enjoyed her singing.  We have watched it over and over.  Good Show!
B000002HH2|5.0|Post is the second solo album from Bjork - and is a masterpiece!!<br />The CD takes you on a journey that begins violently and ends trippy, with<br />love, elation, and devotion in the middle.  Bjork's talent as an artist<br />comes through loud and clear here!!
B0055S348W|2.0|I would love to use this, but so far cannot.  You would expect that it would allow you to simply type in an IP address to print to, but no, it must \\"discover\\" the printer.  So no go on printing over a grown-up routed network or even over the internet using port forwarding unless you want to dedicate a computer that stays on 24x7.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great game for quick fun. Easy to start a game and continue later if needed. I recommend this for any sge
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I keep it real simple. I admit I don't use all the features so take this review with a grain of salt. i mainly use evernote for quick note taking and having documents on hand ... I tend to refine my work and papers on other programs (ie word or excel) then transfer them over to have them on hand. For that use its been great and finding notes and specific its great.
1617930598|5.0|Just finished this book and being from Chicago, I must say JG is a master storyteller!! David Zinc's character is inspring and the overall plot is so riddled with deatails that this is a must read for any professinal who has questioned the status quo of big business and it's obsession with manipulating working capital.....
B0063IH60K|5.0|If you want to play solitaire, pick this app. It's simple, fun, attractive, and easy to use. I play this game non stop on both my Kindle Fire and my iPod touch.
B0000062FN|5.0|I own the first three, the essential and Supernatural.  The essential is really cool.  Supernatural I can do without.  That was kind of an introduction to Santana for me.  I picked up their first record from a used bin for .50 cents.  It was all scratched up and skipped and was totally awesome.  I re-purchased the cd new from Amazon and was blown away.  I picked up Abraxas and III shortly after.  These three records totally rock.  They are that good.  They are like a progessive trio of albums.  They get better as they move from the first track of Santana to the final track of III.  Get these if you are a fan of good music.  I highly recommend the first three Santana albums.
B0063IH60K|3.0|nice touch screen fun to play. enjoyed playing hope to get more free games like this in the future thank you
B005G6QF8Y|5.0|I got the cut Wonderland from Amazon for free. And the album was recommended to me several times by Amazon. Then Amazon put the silly thing on sale for $3.99 and I couldn't turn it down. Frankly I would have been happy paying the full price. The songs are fun, catchy, some explicit and are a really pleasant surprise. I never expected it to be that good. I was wrong. If you enjoy Wonderland or listen to other songs on her website then please buy this. She deserves our support.

B0058VW36U|5.0|this game is awesome but I'm going to talk about order and chaos since they took it off the app store. its day 3 of the invisible update for order and chaos. the game will not play without an update but this update does not exist. so don't buy order and chaos until this is fixed.
B005HSL626|3.0|im not rich, so i cant buy the full version. id like it better if there was more yo do on the free verson.
1451627289|5.0|One of my favorites... by Stephen King or anyone else. Time travel, history, love, boxing, dancing, high school theatre... awesome.
B003YCIE68|5.0|I have loved this movie for years. Not real gimmicky and has a gentle moral tale to it. Would recommend it for ages 8 and up.
0060254920|5.0|Growing up this was one of mine and my wife's favorite books ever. So now that we have little ones of our own, this was something we HAD to have. We were very happy to see that the kids enjoy it as much as we did and still do. Still a great read after over 20 years.
B005ZUR724|1.0|I bought this game on November 19th and it is an incredible game.  The problem is that the company doesn't know how to manage customers.  How can you seriously make a game unplayable by introducing an update for only a few of the versions of the game you have out?  Why couldn't you have coded the update for all of the platforms and released it all at the same time instead of doing a half-assed job that alienates a large percentage of your customer base?  Just a look at the reviews suggets that Gameloft seriously dropped the ball on this one and hope that they learn from this so that it is not repeated in the future.
0385737955|2.0|the concept of the book is really cool! I got to chapter 11 though and had to stop reading it, I couldn't take the lack of grammar and the book not being written in the \\"first person\\". It was though, but I couldn't make it through. Perhaps another author may be able to tackle a concept this good and really write a kick ass book. I decided to be out the 10 bucks and move onto the hunger games which i haven't been able to put down. I really wouldn't recommend this book.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|this a clever game. objects are difficult to find since they blend into background. I like the other tasks to complete.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Recently my HTC EVO View (Flyer) upgraded to Honeycomb(3.2).  Now the Kindle app freezes and has to be re-installed once a day.  I expected better from Amazon.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the first time I wrote a review for a product.  After playing with the game for a few days I have come to the conclusion that this is definitely one of the best classic games I have ever played. I read some of the reviews before downloading.  some complaints were that the cards were too small or they can't win games.  I have no idea what they mean.  to me the cards are appropiately sized and had no problems finishing the games.  best part is that its free.  great game to pass the time.
0446677450|3.0|I found this but in a box while moving about 4 four years ago. Anyway I liked the but Robert makes very good points about knowing the deference between assets and liabilities, but that's about all you get.
B004MPESSY|2.0|I know my review title is weird and I did that on purpose. Someone told me long ago that a movie where a man is shown losing his manhood brings a lot of people to see it regardless how bad the movie is. It is weird but something tells me he was right. Be that because women who think rapers should have their manhoods cut-off (as painful as possible) or even men who find it cool - yes, cool - to see other men being punished by beautiful women, some sort of dark sadistic fetish. Though I have no simpathy for rapers, sex-offenders overall, or any serial killer, I expect revenge type of movie to be more well elaborated. I do pay attention to the plot, it has to have some logic behind it. I did not see the original movie but this one is a little too simple, follows the A-B-C line: A victim is cowardly abused / The victims survive and prepares the revenge / The victim shows the true colors. Com on, a young beautiful and innocent writer goes to a swamp to stay alone in a shack? She should be wearing a t-shirt with \\"rapers, I am alone, fragile and I am beautiful\\" written on it, it was almost like that. It could be more well elaborated. She should have a boyfriend with her or the story should take place in a not so God forsaken place. It is too obvious . If the point is just punish them and make it hurt where it should hurt, then Sudden Impact (1983) is the right one to watch. Jennifer Spencer blows a lot of malehoods before shooting them between the eyes. The reason I watched \\"I spit on your grave\\" (2011) was purely movie fan curiosity as I have heard so much about the original. I guess \\"Law abiding citizen\\" is more of a revenge than this one. I like the \\"Last house on the left\\" better too. I don't want to disencourage you to watch this movie, but definitely not so good for gore-type fans, revengers or even rageful women. S(my humble opinion). I guess revenge type of movies can be less graphic and still shocking for the delight of their fans. Sarah Butler is very hot though.
B005V1WZ10|3.0|First off, i wish i had just downloaded the album from amazon instead buying the cd/dvd, i would have saved money that way, i thought the dvd was a concert Korn had done in crop circle when actually it was just them playing some songs in a crop circle and not worth the extra four or six dollars, plus shipping.<br /><br />for the cd, fifty five percent of it is great, the other forty five percent is good, not really what expected, get up and narcissistic cannibal are my favorite, i also like way too far, lets go, chaos lives in everything, burn the obedient.<br /><br />thats all.
B005HSG3U6|4.0|I got the Micro ware Folio Shell cover for my Fire because I wanted the thinnest protector so my Fire would fit in my purse.  This cover does works for that purpose.  I will probably order a Marware leather cover next.
0439023491|5.0|This book is truly amazing. Not only does it involve action on almost every page, but Catching Fire also includes many unpredictable twists and turns throughout the entire book.<br />This is a must-read for all ages!
B004LWZW4W|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever watched.  Great story, characters you can relate to and care about and lots of action without getting too gory.  Had a great blend of CGI and real footage, but managed to avoid the \\"green screen\\" look.  I loved the original \\"apes\\" movies and TV show as a child/teen, and this had the same spirit, with MUCH stronger visuals.  The 2001 Planet of the Apes re-make was okay, but it was not anywhere close to this.  People in ape suits just do not compare to what they have done with Andy Serkis and the motion capture.  Andy Serkis helped the apes come to life in an amazing way.  Also, they have made the CGI ape faces so expressive that you know just what they are thinking and feeling.  (If you have a couple of extra minutes, it is worth watching the extras where they show Andy Serkis doing the motion capture and facial expressions of \\"Caesar\\".)  Very well done and I can't wait to see the next in this series.  Please don't wait 10 years for the next installment!

0792164903|3.0|I own a few of Burton's films, and it's obvious he has no clear vision regarding the scope of his projects. Edward Scissor Hands, Sleepy Hollow, his version of Planet Of The Apes, The Corpse Bride, Beetle Juice are all basically small concepts forcibly stretched out into attempts at full movie scripts. So far the only film a value in a critical sense by him is Sweeney Todd... and that subject is basically hack material by now. I feel this is like most Burton movies, a little bit of his quirky style and not much else... no stand out acting, boring redundant Elfman soundtrack boys choir and all... \\"ooooo~ewwwww~oooooo~ahhhhhhh~haaaaaa~haaaaaa~oooooo\\"   I doubt Burton has the capacity to conceive of anything of true substance having made countless films all revolving around cheap fluff material.
0307454541|5.0|I finished reading The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo around three-thirty this morning and I still can't believe how brilliant it was!  My husband bought me a copy and I started it as soon as it arrived.  Lisbeth Salander is one of the most likable characters that I have come across.  I had heard a lot about how great this book was and so I was expecting it to be pretty awesome.  What I found though was that words cannot describe this book.  No matter how great I tell you it is, you won't understand unless you read it for yourself.  I cannot recommend this book enough.
B004LWZW4W|3.0|I just bought the original Planet Of The Apes boxed set on Blu-ray, the special 40 Year Evolution so I'm a fan of the series. This was better than I thought it would be having only watched the Amazon instant video version in low quality since my connection is crap slow... so I'll probably enjoy it more when i get the Blu-ray order. The star of the movie are the Apes no doubt, and the CG animations are pretty good... but it's the story and screenplay that makes you interested enough to suspend one's disbelief. Pinto is dead gorgeous and Franco does an adequate job but nothing special. The premise of how the apes acquired accelerated intelligence is something new and leaves me to wonder what's in store for sequels should this film prove lucrative enough to warrant further movies.   Not a bad beginning, but the real challenge will be in creating a great sequel. I feel this film lacked a sic-fi edge, the soundtrack left me wanting for something a lot more mysterious... it plays out like a drama too much rather than sic-fi, I would have preferred something more enigmatic and puzzling in a score relating to this type of fantasy.

B0034G4P94|5.0|There is no simple way to describe this movie, heart-wrenching, amazing, fascinating, unforgettable, etc., etc., the list goes on and on. In truth it must be watched to really understand the depth of it. All I can say is that it is a true masterpiece.

B000001GJX|3.0|This is the only time Karajan did the Mozart C minor Mass. Usually on such one-off occasions where Karajan recorded a piece just a single time, he knocked it out of the park. Good examples being Mahler's 5th, R. Strauss's Sinfonia Domestica and Alpine Symphony and Nielsen's Inextinguishable. This Mozart Mass however is not on the same exalted level even though the Penguin Guide recommended it as perhaps the best \\"traditional\\" version. I personally feel that Leonard Bernstein's version with the Bavarian orchestra, which is also on DG, is the better choice for a big, traditional account of this piece.<br /><br />Why does this recording not fully deliver? Let's start with balances. With a huge orchestra and chorus, it is difficult for a conductor to keep everything in the sound picture. The orchestra has a tough time keeping itself in check, blaring over a sea of singers. Throughout the piece, the organ part is barely distinguishable behind a blanket sound of strings and chorus. The soloists don't stand out. Arleen Auger for Bernstein is exemplary, like a angel from heaven. Karajan has Barbara Hendricks, who is fine but not in the same league.<br /><br />Then we have Karajan's tempos, all slow and heavy by today's standards. Not that I mind that but compare it with Bernstein who also has a big conception of the work and still moves much faster, with more drama instead of the high-gloss Karajan treatment. Track 6 is a great case in point, with Bernstein getting through it in 5 and 1/2 minutes while Karajan drags on for 7 and 1/2, a huge discrepancy for just one section of the Credo. The Karajan take sounds grandiose the first time one hears it but it grates on your nerves in later hearings, feels like everyone is moving underwater in diving suits. And yes, the organ on Bernstein's CD is clear and fully part of the aural picture.<br /><br />Not that any of these old school versions will matter much to the period instrument crowd. I am writing this to recommend a more 19th century conception of this music. The Berlin Philharmonic supports the chorus with it's plush underpinnings and DG's remastered sound for this Gold CD is leagues better than the original issue. But there is still a lot of congestion at climaxes. On a more positive note... the cover design for this CD as with many other Karajan Gold discs is fantastic. An artistic and imposing photo and with that Gold foil on top of it. I love it!
6305232660|5.0|Tea Leoni, Elijah Wood, Robert Duvall and Morgan Freeman are excellent.<br />The themes of family, forgiveness, courage and self-sacrifice are inspiring. A giant meteor, big enough to cause catastrophic damage and death to most of the Earth, is headed on a collision course with our planet. Plans are put into place to preserve our society and attempt to divert the galactic missile before impact.<br />A departure from the standard Hollywood approach, when disaster is looming (initial attempts to destroy the meteor have failed), the president (Morgan Freeman) appears on TV to inform the citizens what to expect, and at the end of his speech he offers Judeo-Christian comfort and peace.<br /><br />He says, \\"I wish\\" then he stops himself and says \\"No, wishing is wrong. That is not what I meant. I believe in God. I know many of you don't, but I want to offer a prayer for our survival, mine included.\\" He then goes on to give the Levitical Blessing:<br /><br />\\"The Lord bless you and keep you, the Lord lift up his divine countenance upon you and give you peace.\\"<br /><br />Makes me think of the old saying - There are no atheists in foxholes.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Irelly like the hints, the game isn't too hard for casual play, yet not too easy either. It allows the player just the right amount of difficulty as to not get bored, but to still be able to feasibly accomplish the task. Love it, buy it
B00005RHGL|5.0|One of the best movies of all time in my opinion. From the sets, to the dialogue, to the casting and the story, it is flawless.<br />Val Kilmer turns in a masterful performance as Doc Holiday. He is funny, forceful and tragic.<br />Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp is terrific. He plays the jaded, lost, hardened frontier lawman perfectly. I can't imagine another actor playing this role, or playing it better..<br />There are many others, too many to mention.<br />The story of the Earps against the Cowboys is an old one that has been told many times.<br />This version, though older and in black and white, is excellent<br />[[ASIN:B00008CMR1 Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]]<br />but Tombstone is an updated version, utilizing all the modern cinematic and production equipment, producing a version that takes a back seat to none.<br />The sweeping vistas, haunting score, and scintillating one-liners delivered by Val Kilmer add up to a modern classic that is a must have for any serious movie collection.

Its a good start for someone just starting out, like me. AND WHO CARES THAT IT SAYS COPYRIGHT! its just who printed them. Its a new print of the same deck. I like the muted colors of this deck. Its a good starter!!! Christmas 2011
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I read this book because it was a book club selection, and I was excited because I had heard of it and it sounded interesting.  I agree with another reviewer who compared it to Lemony Snicket's books.  They aren't really anything alike exactly, but kind of have the same feel.  I enjoyed reading this book very much, but I do feel the details of the mystical part of the story got a little fuzzy.  I'm not sure I ever really grasped what was going on with the wights and the hollows and the ymbrynes or whatever.  Also (SPOILER ALERT), I was a little unhappy that Jacob decided to leave his family in the end.  I was hoping there would be a third option for him, but, that's just a personal preference.  I would have rather rated this book with 3 1/2 stars, but since that isn't an option, I thought it was closer to a 4 than a 3.  The plot was original, I enjoyed reading it, the pace moved along rather nicely, etc.  The ending seems to be paving a way to a sequel.  The biggest reason I am rating it 4 rather than 5 is because I don't think I will be interested in reading a sequel, although a sequel might serve to explain some of the fuzzy details I mentioned previously.  I enjoyed it plenty, but one book is quite enough for me.
B006C1DH92|5.0|such a great game. Works fine on my fire. no freezing. no crashes. I &lt;3 the pinata!  the challenges are fun and I love the random bombs. No glitches.

B003L77FYS|5.0|Great show!  This item was a gift and the recipient was THRILLED!  She's a big Castle fan.  Castle is family friendly (for 13+) - it's still a murder mystery show. but is not as immoral as most shows out there these days.  Plots are thick, characters are well developed, and Castle is HILARIOUS!  I think Beckett could loosen up, but she's a well defined character!

0375826742|1.0|In the very first installment of this series, protagonist Eragon and his first tutor/mentor Brom discuss the ancient language and magic. the first spell Eragon ever casts is \\" Brisingr\\" a wildly dangerous beast that unleashes a violent burning fire on the world. Brom then explains how the meaning of the word isn't important, but what it means to the caster. If I were to cast \\"Brisingr\\" in the world of Alagaesia, nothing would happen, because to me, Brisingr means nothing more than sheer boredom.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0756949149 Eragon (Inheritance Cycle (PB))]] by Christopher Paolini was an interesting tale marred by horrendous writing and a so-so pace. Regardless of how rough it was around the edges, the story showed promise. Then, Paolini released [[ASIN:0375840400 Eldest (Inheritance Cycle, Book 2)]], which not only didn't improve upon Eragon, it actually made the problems highlighted in the first book even worse. Eldest had horrible pacing, long chapters filled with little to no action, and page upon page of descriptions of nature.<br /><br />I have this little compulsion-type thing where I *have* to finish a series even if I hate it. So, now, I've gone on to read Brisingr. I am writing this review for many reasons, but one of them is to warn potential readers of the whole series: so far, it has not gotten better. Try your hand at something else.<br /><br />The plot is almost nonexistent. If you look at the summary on the book, you'll read about \\"Oaths Sworn\\" that Eragon must fulfill. This is as exciting as it seems: the first 600 pages of this novel are literally just Eragon doing random tasks that he feels the need to complete because he once swore an oath. This means handing out gold, doing lots of traveling, and even one disturbing instance involving a run-in with an enemy that causes the reader to sympathize more with the victim, and not Eragon, the one dishing out a cruel punishment instead of killing a man.<br /><br />The last 150 or so pages have some plot elements... but nothing huge. Paolini, once again, totally retcons something he had been exploring during Eldest and the beginning of this book, forcibly inserting some history and confusion that doesn't exactly sit right within the series. It's not so much the revelation that bugs me, but the fact that I can see how forced it was on the author's part. Then there's a bloody battle and a Rowling-esque plot device is revealed.<br /><br />As a whole, the continuity is all over the place. People take oaths in the ancient language, only to have the novel reveal that oaths can be broken depending on how somebody feels or if they decide to be nice instead of mean. Nasuada is neither nice to Eragon, nor mean, and all of her conversations with him feel stilted and wooden. One random digression into the woods shows a gemstone of a character named Tenga, who is never mentioned again. Characters pop in and out, Eragon eats meat without regret again, throw in some random, predictable deaths and you get Brisingr.<br /><br />The characterization of Eragon is really starting to take a toll on me. He was a basic, boring stock character in the first volume. In Eldest, he proved annoying, but competent. Now, he is just, for lack of a better term, a jack-ss. First, he awkwardly insists on calling \\"Garrow\\" his father, which is definately off-putting to his usually sympathetic cousin, Roran. Then, wherever he goes, he gets total praise and admiration... for deeds he performed out of sheer luck. Everything he tries to do in Brisingr (From killing the Raz'Zac to flying to Ellesmara) only benefits him, and although the rest of the Varden gets annoyed, they still cheer and give him free things whenever he returns home.<br /><br />One thing horrible in this book is the writing. Paolini showed promise in Eragon, but since Eldest, he has disintigrated even farther. Nobody can use the \\" he wrote this when he was 16\\" excuse anymore. He is now a 20-year old, published author. This is inexcusable. His editor should be fired.<br /><br />For starters: everything is in its extreme. When Rhunon creates a new sword, it is \\"the finest sword [she] has ever forged\\", even though she made it in \\"less than a day\\"-- the shortest time *ever*. Often times, Eragon is absolutely exhausted, moreso than he has ever been before, but he fights the tiredness and the threat of sleep because he must be the strongest in the land to defeat Galbatorix, the most evil rider of all time. Saphira, the only female dragon left, also adores the attention she gets, being the most beautiful creature in the land. Wherever Eragon walks, all the flowers and trees can sense the most amazing presence, something that Arya, the prettiest, smartest, toughest female elf can read.<br /><br />As you can see, it gets really annoying after awhile. \\"-est\\" does not an epic plot make.<br /><br />Next, everything is presented in dreadfully forced archaic language. Every character responds with \\"Aye,\\" because that's remotely scottish sounding and something Tolkein would have done. The dwarves use phrases like \\" mine heart\\" and \\"mine eyes\\" because that sounds ancient and stuff because that's what people under rocks talk like. Then, of course, there is scrubby little Albriech, a tiny farmboy who is uneducated, yet seems to speak as well as Nasuada and King Orrin, two super-powerful diplomats. Why does everyone sound so fancy?<br /><br />In one run-in early on, an enemy starts a conflict by yelling at Eragon, saying \\"Silence, you insolent rascal\\" (182). Kay. Like, I totes mcGotes have that high of diction when I'm infuriated with such a rapscallion as Eragon. JK.<br /><br />(It should be noted here that, oddly enough, Angela the Herbalist is the only character who sounds remotely human, and that is because she is based entirely off of the author's sister.)<br /><br />Finally, Paolini uses totally unnecesary words. On page 719, he writes \\"Eragon stepped forward then and smote one of the crossbars of the portcullis.\\" The highest diction-level readers in the audience will recognize \\"smote\\" as the proper (?) way to conjugate the verb \\"to smite\\" in the past tense. Isn't Paolini smart?<br /><br />Everything in this book is described in long similes. There are birds like fish, anger like red hot molten stuff, tears like diamonds, love like flowers. The most effective authors are clear... not confusing. Some of the battle scenes, in the haste of things like \\"excitement\\" and \\"violence\\", the writing becomes muddled and unclear, oftentimes confusing. Combined with elevated diction, its a wonder anyone knows what is going on anymore!<br /><br />Instead of starting out weak and developing into something unique, this series started out weak and has devolved into something even more cliched than its start. Every new idea introduced is clearly derived from soemthing else. The characters are even more stocky and out of control. I no longer could reccommend this series to anyone in good will.<br /><br />And that, to be honest, makes me sad. As an author, Paolini had so much hope for the future when he publsihed Eragon. Unfortunately, as the series *needed* to be dragged out to four novels because of the *complexity* shown in this novel, I have no hope for [[ASIN:0375856110 Inheritance (Inheritance Cycle, Book 4)]]. Who knows? Maybe with my low expectations, I'll appreciate it more.e.

B0000524CY|1.0|I've never seen the original Exorcist movie. But I am into scary movies. So hubby bought this movie for me. It is interesting to watch in the beginning. But it goes on for ever with the boring talking. Hubby said that's all add on. They have, suppose to be, scare faces popping out in some scenes. It makes the movie look stupid. I wish I got the chance to watch the original version. This version of the movie was too boring and stupid.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|The watch looks better than in pictures, subtel but still quite eye-catching. It's not a luxury piece that people would first pay attention to the watch instead of the owner, it's something that people will suddenly notice and then think 'nice watch...'.  Echo the previous reviews, it's pretty small, the band is quite narrow too but should do good on a midsize man.  PS: I got it on sale, $55, great value for the money.

0815411839|5.0|Spoto's story of the life of MM is meticulously researched and a well-written biography. He truly seems focused on telling her story with proof, not speculation. The affairs with the Kennedys, the conspiracies regarding her death. . .all hogwash. What remains is the story of a woman who never felt she was good enough, unconvinced of her talent or her worth. What's especially tragic is just as her life was getting on track (she was due to remarry Joe DiMaggio and had projects in her future), she passed away, not because of some CIA, mafia, or other conspiracy, but because of. . .well, you'll have to read the book to find out. A quick read that kept me interested throughout.

0439023513|3.0|Spoilers ahead.  If you had told me this was fan fiction to tide us over until the real book 3 came out, I'd have probably believed it.  Too many of the characters came across as mere empty shells, the flow and pacing felt awkward, and character motivations lacked the clarity and consistency we'd come to expect.  And having Katniss' mission, 3 books in the making, end with her getting blown up and then learning of the outcome weeks later felt very anticlimactic.  But ok, that's a creative choice, and I can deal with that.  But in the movie version, will anyone seriously accept the fall of the capitol and Snow's capture happening off-screen?  I doubt it.  And similarly, when the perceived leader of the rebellion assassinates the newly-installed leader, this turn of events must have seemed completely incomprehensible to the survivors.  The trial had the potential for intensely dramatic storytelling, and yet again, the entire thing transpires \\"off screen\\".  That just felt lazy and rushed.

Ijust hope they arte done experimenting and get back to what they know best.  Rock on!!!!!
B004I8WD6E|4.0|I read many of the reviews after purchasing the case, but so far I love everything about it. I haven't noticed the difference in taking pictures yet like most of complained about. The most difficult part of this is putting it on because it is super snug but once it's on, it's great and even on the black iphone4s.  My other qualm which has nothing to do with the product, more towards the shipping was shipping with Amazon. I originally ordered this case December 18th with prime and was notified next day that it had shipped, and then four days later was notified that it shipped again (meaning it hadn't shipped the first time) so the case showed up 9 days after my original puchase date. Be careful when the shipper is Amazon because they tend to take a lot longer from what I read form message boards. I may look at alternative sites next time I need a case.

Overall the quality is good and my son is happy therefore so am I.
1451648537|1.0|Steve Jobs was a pirate and con artist.  He made no seminal technology contributions, and he abused other people and their work.  For the media to praise this outrageous offender in the way they have is itself outrageous.  Jobs stole technology and original ideas from others, such as Xerox PARC, and rushed them to market with gimmicky software.  His whole con game was to hire a bunch of code punchers to write software quickly and then wow the mindless masses with the stupid toys that resulted, before his competitors could get a competing product to market.  When the competitors did catch up, their products eventually were better than the crap coming out of crApple.  He repeated the same cycle over and over.  How can the media and other mindless masses be so stupid and not see right through this con game?  Jobs was just a former drugged-up hippy who learned how to manipulate other people for his own personal gain.  It is unfortunate that the rating system requires me to enter a star to get my review posted in the system. The book does not earn the one star that I was required to give it.

0062060554|2.0|What starts as a great premise, and a blockbuster first chapter, quickly devolves into a boring slog where long exposition and repetition replace action and narrative. I couldn't help feel at the end of the book that this was a Lifetime movie in book form. How you feel about that statement will largely color how you feel about this book. There are no distinct characters or settings. It's really just one device, one trick, that doesn't get resolved until the last ten pages. At the end, I didn't think it was worth it.
B0002IQMKM|4.0|I don't have any other TH albums, but this one has quite a few gems.  From the opening bass line in \\"Psycho Killer\\", the song grabs you and runs away with your mind, David's screaming a french lyrics are so cool.  \\"Take Me to the River\\" is as hypnotic sweet nectar today as the first time I heard it, 'washing me down..\\"  Another classic rock and roll song that becomes more and more a prophetic anthem is the ever chugging along \\"Life During Wartime\\" - it kicks off from the opening downbeat and never stops - sorta like a rock-n-rolling runaway train.  The next really mind-tripping song is one I've never heard on the radio - sorta like U2's \\"Wire\\" - \\"Memories Can't Wait\\", probably best to listen to on a foggy night with your buds.  Top 40 staples \\"Once in A Lifetime\\", \\"Burning Down the House\\", \\"And She Was\\". and \\"wild wild life\\" are here as well.  One of the best ever sing-along songs ever recorded is \\"Road to Nowhere\\", played at full volume in a room of roawdie singers is always a blast!
0385534639|5.0|The circus arrives without warning, and so does the magic of this story. Layers of fantasy and romance, intrigue and drama, weave together under black and white tents that reveal some of their mysteries at night. Like all great shows, though, the real story is happening off stage, where two magicians compete in a competition that not even they understand. In a market too saturated with the same old safe stories, this is a daring leap into a dream-like world that leaves the reader satisfied and longing for more. This was the best book I read all year.

B00382X4X2|5.0|in the metal testament, this release was the book o' acts...it represented a distinct venture into even more wondrously disturbing territory for rock-n-roll; particularly the title track, which is w/o doubt one o' THE most powerful songs ever written.  Ever.  EVER!    true confession : i was deep into elo territory when the film `heavy metal' broke.  being slightly under-aged a friend and i had to resort to an omaha drive-in to catch it on the big screen - this was at the beginning o' that technologically-advanced era where the soundtrack could be routed through the car's stereo system.  when the possessed army stormed the peaceful citadel and started pumping foot-long spikes into its defenseless citizens, this was the soundtrack to the carnage; a more perfect marriage o' audio and visual there has NEVER been.  something clicked in my brain's loins at that moment, almost as if my frontal lobe's balls finally dropped, and I have never looked back since...  mob rules was definitely my gateway drug into the rabid world that is metal, and it is still where I prefer to hang my scalp.  the rest o' the album is also solid, but it gets 5 stars for context - sorry, you had to be there to fully understand  fun fact : bev bevan - elo's drummer - bashed skins for sabbath on their `born again' tour...one o' those circle-o'-life kinda things
B005M2A4D4|5.0|My kids love all of dr who shows. They have all of the recent series but laught that I used to watch the ones with Tom Baker.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|This movie is not for everyone as it is like no other movie I have ever seen. It is very emotional and powerful without using a lot of dialogue or elaborate dramatic sequences. I sort of knew what to expect from previous Terrence Malick films, however I was left speechless and emotional after watching this film. I think people who have children may look at it differently than those who do not. It is about life, however it is also about father (Brad Pitt) and son (Sean Penn) and their relationship and how the son's growth and outcome in life relates to his upbringing.<br /><br />The film is comprised of beautifully breathtaking shots of nature and life and events. It truly is a documentary of life and even the cinematography and camera angles remind me of a nature documentary. The camera floats around the objects and actors as we view them relating to situations and simply living. There are some dramatic conversations and emotional scenes, however I believe I could type up the script for the entire film on one page, double-spaced. The movie somehow captures all the emotion and feelings in the characters simply by their strong emotions. Brad Pitts wife in the film, Jessica Chastain, perfectly captures the emotional power of the situations her and the family are put into.<br /><br />The entire film is accompanied by beautiful music, which perfectly blends the visual and audio aspect of the film. This film is beautifully directed and one which I am proud to own. It will have a different affect of each viewer, however The Tree of Life left me speechless and in tears of beauty and remembrance of youth and growing up.<br /><br />The Tree of Life is by far the clearest most accurate Blu-ray I have ever viewed, and I own over 800 Blu-rays and view all of them on a Sony 55\\" 240hz HDTV. Having a strong audio system is also important. I cranked this film up as instructed when I inserted the disc. The speech is low and the music is high and crisp. It is a beautiful film and will stand as one of the most influential, emotional, beautiful films of all time. I highly recommend at least one watch of this film on an HDTV.nfluential, emotional, beautiful films of all time. I highly recommend at least one watch of this film on an HDTV.

I keep watching it over and over and it still is exciting every time.  Harrison Ford was a great surprise too.  I really love this movie.

B001DHXT1G|5.0|I continue to fail to understand why many didn't like this movie.  It was very well done, from the CGI to Norton's performance, to the story.  As a lifetime comics fan, and have found most comics-to-screen adaptations sadly lacking, if not miserable.  This movie was just about the finest done.  It paid homage to the classic TV show, as well as the comic's character itself.  It had thoughtfulness and action and made the Hulk seem very real.  Effects were as good as you'll find, and this was just about the best Hulk rendition you discover.  Norton had all the stances and mannerisms that Bill Bixby incorporated into his Banner portrayal.  If you've read negative reveiws of this film, and are a true Hulk character fan, then ignore them.  This is one of the best ever comic adapted movie made.

159420229X|5.0|Who knew that a book on memory would be the most visual experience of my year? Of course any memory expert will tell you that the easiest memories to recall are ones that stand out from the rest. Moonwalking with Einstein is a history of memory and of trying to remember. It's also a partial how-to guide on memorizing unusually long lists of trivial data. One of the most interesting tidbits from the book is how we consider the ability to recall nearly perfectly a good thing and yet those rare individuals whose minds approach a true photographic status are seen as handicapped due to their lessened ability to distinguish the quality of a memory.<br /><br />There's a scene near the end of the book, during the Speed Cards round at the U.S. Memory Championships, where the title of the book comes from. The excitement of this moment is a perfect climax for both the reader and the author's efforts.<br /><br />Given the recent success of a movie like Moneyball (about baseball statistics) I think it's possible that a movie about memory could be a hit as well.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I saw The Pacific first and didn't think it could be beaten.  I don't know how I missed this one when it first came out.  I'd heard of it, but never saw it.  I have to admit that this is truly one amazing series.  While I still like The Pacific, I finished watching this one in less time because I was so captivated with the story.  I also liked the interviews with the real soldiers at the beginning and on the extras DVD.  I'm glad those interviews and the reunion were recorded while they were still alive.  This series and The Pacific really show the truth behind WWII and what those men had to endure.  I was especially enamored with the episode about the medic because I was an army medic years ago.  It was very easy to sympathize with him since I know many medics during war time (then and now) are targeted.  My DVD's arrived two days past the estimated arrival date, but I can't complain since it was Christmas week.  All DVDs were in great condition and none missing as I've seen reported.  I was surprised the series was not shot in widescreen, but that didn't deter from the quality of the program.  I highly recommend this series as well as The Pacific, but I think I'm leaning more toward Band of Brothers as my new favorite between the two.  I'm glad I have both and hope to see more.  This series could have cost twice what I paid for it and it would still be worth it.

B005VPRGB0|5.0|As I've said in other reviews, I very much like these little Technic sets (you might as well ignore my star rating), even for kids below the recommended age range. Yes, you may need to assist on the build, but that's a great opportunity to teach children about reading and following plans. What I especially like about these sets is that they exhibit mechanical functions in a simple and obvious way, AND they hold together better than their brick-built cousins (Lego Technic sets are primarily held together with pins).   This set arrived in late 2011 and follows a number of earlier off-road vehicles in the Technic line, notably the Quad Bike from 2006 (#8282) and the Dune Buggy from 2008 (#8296). These sets are larger than mini-figure size and so they are really out of proportion with regular Lego sets (e.g., the City line). Of the 2012 sets, I am recommending this set highly because of its mechanical features, playability, and price-point. The set includes working steering, front and rear spring-driven suspension, and a chain drive. That is a good value and good fun, especially for a child that enjoys automotive stuff. The B-model for the set (it includes directions for both) is a dune buggy; it is fine, but not as attractive as the A-model.   Amazon (by which I mean Amazon proper) often has very competitive pricing on these sets. If Amazon is not selling it, prices will vary wildly. I am also recommending for 2012 the two sets below this one (#9390 and #9391); these other ones may fit your wallet or child's interests better.

Not only is it a beautiful case but it fits and holds my KF (Kindle Fire) in place. I read many reviews and some people said their KF did not fit or was too tight but mine fit perfectly, which makes me feel certain that it's not going to fall out. If you are not constantly taking your KF in and out of it's case (which you shouldn't because that is why you have a case to begin with), the elastic bands to hold in the the Kindle should hold out for a very long time. Get this case!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I cant say anything bad about evernote! Pros: everything, cons: none, especially now that they have the widget app that allows me to move the main app to sd and still use the evernote widget on my htc inspire.  I'm new to using on kindle fire, but so far the only thing I miss is my camera. Of course that's ONLY because KF doesn't have it. It's just that I tend to lean on snapping a pic instead of actually typing notes.  However, I LOVE that I can keep making notes and snapping pics on my inspire and view it all on my KF!  only thing I would ever think of adding would be the ability to hand write/scribble notes, but I give 5+ stars still!

B0012OVFV6|5.0|Santana's second album, featuring Mati Klarwein's painting `Annunciation' as very striking cover-art, was released in September 1970 and followed on from the young band's modestly successful 1969 debut album.<br /><br />The music on `Abraxas' raised the bar with a masterful blend of complex Latino rhythms (salsa, cumbia, merengue) integrated into hard-edged rock numbers, slower ballads and driving instrumentals with inventive time-signatures. It's bursting with energy but at the same time displays a maturity and finesse less evident on the debut album and not recovered until `Caravanserai' (the third album, which followed `Abraxas,' is good but for different reasons).<br /><br />Highlights for most fans would be Carlos's beautiful 2-part guitar ballad `Samba Pa Ti' which just about everyone on Earth recognises; the definitive melodic version of Peter Green's `Black Magic Woman' paired with `Gypsy Queen' with a complex driving rhythm, and the clever instrumental `Incident at Neshabur' which incorporates numerous clever time-signature and tempo changes. Greg Rolie's vocal-and-organ dominated `Mother's Daughter' and `Hope You're Feeling Better' add cornerstones of sing-able hard-rock songs to the album, and the masterfully integrated congas and tablas from Mike Carabello and Jose Chepito Areas add so much to the complex percussive-dominated sound that - paired with Carlos Santana's wailing, soulful guitar - they define the distinctive character of the band.<br /><br />It's beautiful, and in 40 years hasn't aged a day. If you don't know it, you really should give it a listen. It's a great, great album from a dynamic, talented young band at the top of their game, and is a true original. No-one ever really copied Santana's distinctive sound, and they retained a character uniquely their own.<br /><br />The name `Abraxas' BTW was taken from a line in German author Hermann Hesse's book `Demien' (Hesse's mystical writings were very trendy in the 1970s).<br /><br />Production values from the 1970 studio sessions were exemplary and you have several versions of the album to choose from, many of those issued in later years incorporating bonus `live' material - all of it good.values from the 1970 studio sessions were exemplary and you have several versions of the album to choose from, many of those issued in later years incorporating bonus `live' material - all of it good.
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|I got this for my 2 year old son for Christmas. He is a Car's fanatic. This was a very cute movie. It reminds me of a kids version of James Bond. My son loves this movie. He watches it everyday. Sometimes he wants to watch it back to back. My 5 year old daughter even likes this movie.
B0000062FJ|4.0|Santana's 1969 debut album stands apart from most other rock and pop of the period in deploying a unique fusion of San Francisco rock, Latino rhythms and complex African-influenced percussion. This young band made a big impact with a fresh sound, often fast and furious, full of percussive sophistication overlaid with the young Santana's wailing guitar which quickly became their trademark.<br /><br />Hard-edged songs with more traditional verse-chorus structure are mixed with heavily percussive numbers - sometimes with Spanish-language lyrics as in `Jingo' - and the occasional slower-tempo number like `Treat'. The star track on this album is of course `Soul Sacrifice', the long-playing Latino instrumental rocker which had the 1969 Woodstock festival audience on their feet for 10 minutes, prominently featured in the eponymous film of the event and established the band's reputation with a wider audience.<br /><br />It's instructive to listen to this first studio album from Carlos Santana's young band in the context of their second - and more polished - outing just one year later, `Abraxas'. There are similarities and differences, but you can hear the compositions and editing mature and become rapidly more sophisticated.<br /><br />The three extra tracks not available on the original vinyl are well worth having and, if you're discovering Santana's impressive back catalogue, this is a good place to start.

145551389X|5.0|Amazing stunning pictures of a woman who is truly changing the world. This is nothing but pure perfection and everything you would expect from GaGa. Fashion, Technology, and the real stefanie unmasked in her most intimate moments. I don't know what other people were saying about the binding or the condition of the book, mine came perfectly and a day early. A very wise purchase and has been sitting in my room as a table book, and everyone can't stop picking it up and looking. Gaga is truly the best thing that has happened to the music industry since Michael Jackson and breaking boundaries and changing the world on LGBT issues around the globe. I love this book and everytime I look through the pages it inspires me to be myself and love myself no matter what others say. GaGa has sent out a positive force of energy that can not and will not be stopped. This beautiful book is a reminder of her hard work as an artist and her true dedication to her fans. A Must Have. <3

B006C1DH92|5.0|I'm playing this on my Kindle Fire.   Fruit Ninja is already a great game, but I found the addition of puss-in-boots to be a big plus. The overall theme of the game is updated to include the character, and new game modes and multimedia are included as well.  Pro:  + Core gameplay that makes fruit ninja great is still included  + Has a new 'Bandito' mode that lets you play through levels of challenges which I found fun, and with more variety than typical fruit ninja play  + Nice artwork, and background music and sound bytes that match the character!  Con  - None - it's awesome!  Fruit Ninja involves fruits and bombs being thrown randomly on arcs across the screen. Swipe fruit with your finger to cut it in half and get points. Miss a fruit, and you lose a life. Hit a bomb, and the game ends. It's a lot funner than it sounds, and a great way to chew up 30 seconds or 30 minutes. The graphics are top-notch, the sound is fun, and the scoring makes the game quite addictive.  [Disclaimer: I got this game for free, though I would have happily paid for it]

But it should not be that hard to planning. Look at the number of download and extend servers timely, you do not need to be a fortune teller for this. Given we are paying for each month of play time, this server down is not free for us.  It is down now for 2 days. I will revise my rating if this problem is solved in a timely manner.

0545101425|3.0|I listened to the audio version of all three books.  By the time I got to the last, I was weary of Katniss's self-flagellation.  I began to believe she WAS to blame for a lot of the troubles.  I know she was only 16 or 17, and this is what teens do.  But Collins overdid it, I think.  I would have liked to have been inside Peeta's head as well as Gale and listen to their thoughts.  I would have liked Collins to alternate chapters with Peeta's voice and thoughts, as well as Gale's and some other key characters.  I really don't know why Katniss was so popular--I guess I didn't see what everyone else around her saw that made her so exceptional.  There were plenty of exceptional people around her who would have been just as revered had the author given them a chance!  I suppose Peeta was one of them, but not developed as much in the stories.  Having said all that, I got hooked on the trilogy with the first volume.  It kept my attention and I thought the way the games were designed showed some creativity.  Awful, of course, what those kids were put through.  It was obvious from the beginning that this paralleled Greek mythology and Rome's bloody and cruel sports.    One other thing that  bothered me was that if Panem were North America, what was the rest of the world like?  Can't imagine a futuristic society depending just on its own resources--trade with other countries has always been key to survival and beyond.   All of my comments, of course, are views through adult eyes, not teen or young adult eyes.  I probably would not have had most of these criticisms were I still 17!

B004ZNB12O|3.0|For a new listener to Pink Floyd.<br /><br />I am an established Pink Floyd fan, so I don't want to bias this review with the typical, \\"Pink Floyd is an album band and this compilation doesn't do that justice\\".  It may be true, but I want to write this review for those that are potentially new Pink Floyd fans looking to introduce themselves to this wonderful band.<br /><br />First off, Pink Floyd weren't a band of hits.  One could say that only a handful of songs really fit the description of hits.  But, Pink Floyd did have their classic songs, and that is where any Pink Floyd compilation must tread.  They had a lot of classic songs, but it is unfortunate that most compilations don't (and probably can't) get them all into a set.  A set like this becomes further limited as a one disc set.<br /><br />To really try and create a Pink Floyd compilation, you really do need to be a multi-disc set.  Some of Pink Floyd's best songs are epic, and I feel like this album dismisses some of the epic tracks due to the length requirements.<br /><br />The song selection here is not horrible, but as others have noted, it neglects a few albums that did have some great Pink Floyd tracks.  Specifically, I am talking about Animals, Meddle, and Piper at the Gates of Dawn.  It probably wouldn't have been easy to include what could be considered the right songs, but I would argue that songs like Have a Cigar, The Fletcher Memorial Home, and High Hopes could be replaced by songs like One of These Days, Fearless, Sheep, Astronomy Domine, etc.  I have nothing against those three songs that are included, but Have a Cigar leaves a listener one track (maybe 1.5 tracks) short of the whole Wish You Were Here album; tracks from The Final Cut should not take precedence over Animals (I'm guessing length is a factor); and it is just unfortunate that nothing from Meddle is provided.<br /><br />The heavy inclusion of songs from Dark Side of the Moon, The Wall, and Wish You Were Here show the importance of the album in enjoying Pink Floyd.  Yet, this compilation fails here in its sequencing.  If so many songs from those three albums are going to be included, they should be sequenced accordingly.  I realize they are not necessarily sequentially chosen from the original albums, but amongst themselves they would still form better cohesive units than what is provided here.<br /><br />Ultimately, if you are aspiring to be a new Pink Floyd fan, or curious at what the band is about, I suggest looking at some of the other compilations out there. They will have their flaws especially if you read the reviews of Pink Floyd fans who think a hits compilation is blasphemy.  I would recommend [[ASIN:B00005QDW5 Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd]].  It is a two-disc set that does a better job at covering the whole range of Pink Floyd's output.  It is an album that gives you a window into the early Syd Barrett era to the Roger Waters dominated era, to the Post-Waters era in a fully balanced manner.  It is the type of set that will make it easy to see what each album is about.  Last, I wouldn't count out the option of diving into one of their albums.  This specific compilation is heavily weighted on The Wall, Wish You Were Here, and Dark Side of the Moon because they are the most accessible of what Pink Floyd released.  As such, I'd recommend starting with one of those three as a result. They won't make it easy to choose where to go next, but an actual album does make it easy to see just how great the band was at putting together one cohesive work/album vs. the individual tracks.pilation fails here in its sequencing.

B001TOD92C|5.0|For The Wrestler, I was hoping to write a companion review to my review of Black Swan, since these two movies are related, but I am at something of a loss.  This is a good thing.  Black Swan made an interesting review because it didn't quite work as a straight-forward story, requiring some explanation of director Aronofsky's method and purpose.  The Wrestler requires no explanation because it works better as a story.<br /><br />The view of The Wrestler and Black Swan as inversions--age vs. youth, career end vs. failed start, male vs. female, performance arts, physical discipline, broken homes, sexual isolation, suicide--still holds, but whereas Black Swan is often forced, bordering on contrivance, The Wrestler contains similar themes and techniques effortlessly.  The best example of this is Aronofsky's free association technique, which is on display in The Wrestler by referencing Passion Plays when Mickey Rourke wrestles \\"the stapler\\" (a Jesus lookalike) on a bed of barbed wire (aka thorns).  The reference fits seamlessly into the storyline.<br /><br />Whereas Black Swan left me fairly indifferent to the fate of the characters, The Wrestler was quite affecting and deserves the praise it received.  Aronofsky has done an admirable thing in telling the story of a failed man in our society--\\"sacrificial Rams\\" to which we are supposed to be blind, and that we normally see onscreen only in the context of bums or mental health patients.

B0034G4P4O|5.0|Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson set themselves a challenge in translating the iconic comic book character Tintin to the big screen.  Popular in Europe through a series of graphic novels, Tintin is less well known in the US; any movie would have to appeal to both audiences.  A suitable story had to be selected from decades of plots; \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\" borrows elements from three.  Finally, the movie straddles the animation/live action dilemma by using live action capture.<br /><br />The result is a vivid, fast-moving thriller that quickly introduces the young investigative reporter Tintin and his faithful dog Snowy, and sends them off in search of clues to a mysterious ship model and a missing treasure.  Along the way, Tintin links up with the colorful Captain Haddock, who hold one of the keys to the mystery.  The three of them will survive adventures at sea and in Morocco before returning home for a final confrontation with their ruthless opponent and his minions.<br /><br />A clever opening sequence sets the tone for the movie, in which an artist who looks suspiciously like Tintin-creator Herge does a sketch of Tintin in a marketplace.  When Tintin accepts the finished sketch, we see both the familiar face of Tintin and Jamie Bell's movie portrayal.<br /><br />The story is build around plot elements from \\"The Secret of the Unicorn\\" and \\"Red Rackham's Treasure\\" to set up an audience-pleasing treasure hunt, although an inserted segment from \\"The Crab with the Golden Claws\\" is used to get Tintin and Captain Haddock quickly in partnership.  The plot is stitched together with a series of often frantic and sometimes over-the-top action sequences.  This reviewer wishes the producers had settled for a shorter, simpler movie that better captured the exotic but not unrealistic tone of the original stories.<br /><br />\\"The Adventures of Tintin\\" is likely to appeal to new audiences for its fun and adventure, and to long-time fans for its many knowing nods at the pantheon of Tintin characters and story elements.  \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\" is highly recommended to both audiences.lements.  \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\" is highly recommended to both audiences.

B002BWP49C|5.0|I am a huge fan of the movies, and I own them all. I was extremly excited about this installment of one of my favorite love stories. I thought they did a wonderful job taking the book to the big screen. There were some parts that were hard for me to watch, which was the dream Bella had the night before her wedding, and of course the birthing scene was very intense. I loved Jacob's part in the whole movie, how he finally stood up to Sam and took the title that was so rightfully his. I thought it was cool how they allowed us to see the pack converse with each other. But touched me the most was Jacob's imprinting on Renesme. I do agree with one of the other reviewers that they should have cast the part of Renesme growing older with an actual actress not computer generated one. I can't wait to see the special features on the DVD. Overall I Loved this movie and I can't wait for it to come on DVD so I can add it to my Saga collection.
B00631VJIC|5.0|really awesome cd. if you are a fan of the show it is a must have. i wish they would come out with a second one.
B006C1DH92|5.0|I have a tablet and it works great. So much fun for free. Can't wait to play it more. Thanks Amazon. :-)
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is amazing. it has become my one go-to place to store everything. It has allowed me to become completely paperless in a worry free way. I love never having to worry if I have the right notebook with me or leaving my meeting notes on my desk when I ran out in a hurry. From planning very detailed projects...to just a spot to capture random thoughts to tuck away for later...I just can't live without it! A MUST HAVE APP!!!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|My case arrived quickly and is exactly as described. A light-weight case. It keeps my screen scratch free and provides a little protection if I drop it. Looks pretty cool too. Stand isn't the best quality in the world but works well enough.
B000F8O35U|5.0|My daughter loved this movie as a kid and we had it on VHS. However we have misplaced it and although she is much older she wanted it replaced. I have looked everywhere for this and finally found it here. She was so excited on Christmas morning and we had to watch it right away. I couldn't have been more please with the product. It arrived promptly and was just as described. In fact I received it and almost forgot that I had it by the time that Christmas came along. Had it not been for my daughter reminding me that she was really wanting that video! Would definately order from this vendor again!!
B0053B347M|2.0|This light works as described, but unfortunately does not stick well to my particular monitor.  It also does not have an off switch, so I have to physically unplug the USB cable if I leave my computer on standby. An easy-access desk switch would be ideal.
B0029QRA1U|4.0|My parents got this turntable for me as a Christmas gift. I, being the music nut I am, had really wanted the [[ASIN:B001MW69JQ ION USB Turntable w/ Direct-to-CD - ION-LP2CD]] but was just as excited to get this one for converting my vinyl collection to digital. Here's what I've found thus far.<br /><br />Likes:<br />1. The included EZ Vinyl/Tape Converter software is Windows and Mac compatible (also see dislike #1).<br />2. The software is lightweight and quick to install on both Mac and Windows.<br />3. The turntable is very easy to use, even for someone who hasn't used one in many years.<br />4. It can be connected to speakers with the attached RCA connectors thanks to the built-in preamp.<br />5. The unit isn't heavy, bulky or cumbersome in any way.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />1. Although the included software is Mac compatible, the Mac version cannot automatically determine new tracks while the vinyl is recording - the Windows version can.<br />2. The software is not of any use to me except for converting vinyl to MP3 - everything else must be done with an audio editor (see Audio Editing below).<br />3. I'm not a fan of MP3's as the end all be all. I would rather have multiple file conversion options, to include WAV and AIFF.<br /><br />The Dime Trick:<br />One problem I had almost immediately was that my records were skipping and producing a lot of static and pops. This was resolved just as easily by placing a dime on the control arm. Static and pops are part of what makes vinyl so great, but before adding the dime, the static and pops were a little too overbearing. The dime brought them back to a nice vinyl quality (thanks for the tip dad!). The skipping was also greatly reduced by adding the dime. In fact, one Dizzy Gillespie album went from skipping in every song to just one skip at the end of the first song... a little magical audio editing and that was completely taken care of.<br /><br />I have ordered the [[ASIN:B0009IGAPW Audio Technica AT6012 Record Care Kit - Includes Record Care Solution, Brush Pad, Storage Base and Adhesive Tape]] so I can correctly clean my records and maybe with a little luck, I can remove the dime from the control arm without sacrificing quality.<br /><br />Audio Editing:<br />As I mentioned before, static and pops are part of what make vinyl so great. But, when you're digitizing your records, it's also good to remove some of the static and minimize the pops. Some people like to remove all of it; I just like to remove some of it.<br /><br />There are numerous software titles available for audio editing. Some are free, like Audacity. Some are not free, like Adobe Audition. Whichever software you choose for editing, you'll only need to learn the absolute basics of how to use it for most of your converted records. Of course, if you're trying to hide skips you'll need more knowledge, but getting rid of dead space before or after a track, and removing pops and static are very, very easy things to do.<br /><br />I only wish the Ion software were more capable, so additional software didn't have to be used for such basic track editing. On the other hand, I understand why Ion has tried to keep their software as easy as the name implies - not everyone is a music nut and having too many track options would probably confuse some of their customers.<br /><br />Overall, I'm quite impressed. I gave it 4 stars because of the limitations with the software. The turntable itself deserves 5 stars.ape]] so I can correctly clean my records and maybe with a little luck, I can remove the dime from the control arm without sacrificing quality.

0062112430|4.0|What a great premise for this dystopian novel.  I loved her medical descriptions of how 'love' was a disease and the cause of our downfall of our society.  Lauren Oliver is now one of my favorite YA writers.  I did not think she could top Before I Fall, but she has.<br /><br />The romance between Alex and Lena is realistic, exciting and full of angst.  I also loved Hana her best friend and partner in crime...she is complex, strong, loyal and a friend anyone would want in their life.<br /><br />Ms. Oliver has a way of capturing the teenage voice in a way that is accessible, raw and totally engaging.<br /><br />If you love dystopian romantic thrillers...this book is for you.  Start early in the day or you'll be up all night.<br /><br />PG13<br />YA Crossover
B005VR9328|5.0|The Roots are by far one of the most underated hip-hop groups of all time.  Their collectiion of tracks is so extensive it truly boggles the mind.  Since their freshman album, we see a steady increase in maturity from the clan.  They are rooted in hip-hop - yet, they have progressed in many other creative depths and genres.  These guys are musicians.  If you want to compare the Roots crew to Drake then you really need to take a step back and question yourself.  These guys are no fly by night hip-hop group, or MTV/BET idols or commercialized success stories.  The Roots are Hip-Hop!  And furthermore, excellent musicians.  The Roots new album, udun, is pure genius and a great listen.  The creativity exceeds my expectations.  And, Blackthought is in my opinion, Top 5 Dead or Alive...just saying!<br /><br />Peace and Blessings in the New Year.<br /><br />DZA tha Dangerous
B005HIREJK|4.0|I would have given this watch a 5/5, but the band that was shipped with the watch was of poor quality. After putting on/taking off the watch 2 or 3 times, I noticed the band was starting to peel and crack.   Other then that problem (which I hope to have resolved by emailing the company that sold the watch through Amazon) the watch is fantastic. The face is very nice looking and the chrono seems very accurate.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this app. it helps me stay on track, it is easy to pause and set down if I need to.  When I can get back to it, I don't have to worry about finding my place because it does it for me.  I can take notes and highlight or bookmark things.  I love the plans. I can do them at my own pace, and if I fall behind I can easily set it so it catches me up and I start fresh without starting over!  I really love that its all on my phone and I always have that.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|I saw it twice. The first time the poor projection distracted me and left me feeling ambivalent about the movie. Next day went to a different theater and had a chance to really see it. Rooney brings a vulnerability to the role that's new. Not a frame is wasted. Info in each. Masterfully edited. A real enjoyable experience. This crew would really deliver an amazing \\"Fire\\"<br /><br />Courses could be taught plumbing the themes and issues raised in the script and direction:<br />Time- is central to the mystery and is elastic here, slowing, speeding up, deceiving the audience.<br />Fathers and daughters- From the real to the perverted, the wished for and rejected.<br />Touch- the varieties of human contact. Who touches who, who moves away.<br />Sound- trains, floor buffers, the wind, leather on metal.<br />Mothers- where are they?<br />Appearances- we look but do not see what is reality.<br />News- Pay attention to the media, the scroll beneath the news reader, the info flashed on the screen, the headlines. The coffee shop.<br />Greetings- hey,hey or lack thereof.<br /><br />Even if you have read the books and seen the other movies, bring your brain, you will be rewarded. Brilliant.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|I was a teenager when the original Star Trek aired and with the the Apollo program destined for the moon, the show caught the imagination of us kids.  I didn't grow up to be a space scientist, but did become a scientist.  Star Trek fueled my imagination and wonder and still does.  Maybe that is nerdy thing to say, but who cares. Nerds are responsible for the technology that we all enjoy. I became a fan of The Next Generation, in its original run, but with job responsibilities and raising a family, I did not watch the other series.  On a whim, I bought Season 1 of Enterprise in Wal-Mart for less than $20, hoping that I hadn't wasted my money.  I knew of Scott Bakula from Quantum Leap fame and enjoyed that show, so I figured it was worth a try. After the first season I got hooked on this show, eventually buying the other 3 seasons from Amazon.  This show was good in the beginning and got better with each episode. If you have never seen this series, you will not be disappointed, as it is likely, over time, to be evaluated as the best that Star Trek had to offer. It is a shame that it didn't live on for a few more seasons.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I'm sorry, this app is great and all, but it gets one star because due to the lack of a day to day password protection option, it's useless to me. This means that anyone who picks up my Fire can get into my email account. I realize I can lock down my device, but the only thing I need to keep secure from those who have access to it is my email account. Seems like it would be awfully easy to prompt for a password each new time you log in.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|My daughter loves this series then got me hooked, too.  Shocking, Funny, Intriguing, and romantic.  Great music, too, which is always a plus.  If you like One Tree Hill, I think you'll like this, too.
B000SEFNMS|4.0|I've been a fan for some time of Krakauer's writing and was eager to read this prior to the movie coming out. Like Krakauer's other books, this details a life on the fringes; the primary difference I see though is in this Krakauer seems to almost be rooting for his subject. A fun read, however tragic, that taps into the side of us that longs to be free, and the unfortunate short-sightedness that we sometimes fall to while chasing our dreams.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|Excellent movie, very poignant and moving.  Cried several times at the injustices that occurred then and still continue today. Remember, treat others as you would have them treat you.  Will go a long way to remedying the injustices.
B006C1DH92|5.0|I love this game and could play it ALL day!!!! Don't listen to the people who say this game isn't fun!!! :)
B004QK5N5W|5.0|I bought this because I wanted to play hidef movies from my iPod Touch and couldn't with the standard TV adapter. It works flawlessly. It also playback standard def movies as well. It's convenient . . . one connection for both audio and video . . . and a port for a/c power if wanted. Highly recommended. I only wish the cord was a bit longer. But, the fact that it's so short and rather stiff porbably means it won't wear out anytime soon.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is the best. It is just Solitaire nothing more, nothing less. Perfect. This is the perfect game to relieve stress in a short amount of time.
B005TBWN0K|5.0|Fun to doodle with this app on the Kindle Fire!  It does what it is supposed to.  Thanks Amazon for the fun apps.  I lose myself in my Kindle Fire!
B0034G4P4O|1.0|Shame on you, Spielberg and Jackson ... but no, you're not really guilty, because you can't do better, but shame on you, Moffat, whose 'Coupling' we used to love and appreciate so much ...  I'd like to cry like Augustus .... Spielberg, Jackson and Moffat! Give me back my legions ... eh ... my real Tintinstory!!!  And even if you deliver the best images, the best graphics and the best ridiculous action scenes á la Indiana Jones ... in the end it's like eating crap from golden dishes ... it remains crap.  I am so disappointed ....
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This application worked well on the Kindle Fire.  It is useful for when you want to decide what to wear and what the weather will be where you are going.  Very much like the weather on MSN.
B0063IH60K|4.0|sometimes when I have too much on my mind, I can play this game to disconnect from whatever and relax and have fun!
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I love chess and this version is great. The program actually thinks about the moves before doing them  Great game.
B005ZUR724|1.0|Game was working great, but until the new patch is released its useless. ill change my rating to 5 stars once it gets fixed.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|very easy and intuitive to use. A formidable opponent.  difficult to beat after 6-10 drinks, virtually. impossible after 30-34 apparently it wants. more words here THEY ARE
B0063IH60K|4.0|very basic very fun. I would just like to see the winnings tab be a little more developed/interactive. overall tho it gets the job done for a classic boredom curing game
0307591549|5.0|I'm currently a business student and picked up this book thinking it would help me with my professional skills & work ethic, but it's even more universal than that. Anyone in any profession can get something out of this book. The book is organized well and cites a ton of supportive research and interesting real-world examples (my favorite was The Order of the Elephant) but doesn't feel bogged down with data. It's written in an interesting and engaging style so it's easy to read quickly the first time through, but I expect I'll be going back through and writing down a few things I can put into action in my own life.  I would recommend this book to anyone who's looking to improve their performance at work, school, life, anywhere. Even if you consider yourself a pretty positive, optimistic person this book will give you a lot of ideas to go even further in having a good attitude and improving your life.
B0063IH60K|5.0|thanks for a great game. and free! unfortunately I play way too much. until my hand is sore. thanks again (I think).
B005ZUR724|1.0|this app is really fun but after about 2 days then I started to get a update that wouldn't plethora me play unless I updated it.  Hopefully you could change it then It would be a lot better.
B001EIOOV8|5.0|Casino features a vast and rich cast of characters, all of whom have pitch-perfect arcs, which are accentuated by spot-on performances, and a cinematic style which is both engaging and masterfully paced. Every element of the picture, superfluous though some may seem, adds to the grandeur of the characters, the scenery, and the Scorsese-ian tragedy which inevitably befalls them.   Casino is my favorite Scorsese picture, and one of the best films ever made.
B0034G4P94|5.0|Gonna keep it short because everyone has already talked about this film.......<br /><br />...it's one of the best movies I've seen in quite awhile.<br /><br />I liked it better than The Fighter (great movie) and it was great to see Nick Nolte again! Great acting by EVERYONE in this!!<br /><br />After seeing this movie I went out and bought it. Awesome Awesome flick!!!
B003L77G06|5.0|Such a clever and witty show. I bought this not seeing many episodes, and now I'm converted to being an addict.  Good behind the scenes features in the special features too.
B000NU2CY4|2.0|The movie Gladiator (Sapphire Series) [Blu-ray] gives error \\"THIS PLAYER IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH REGION MARKING OF THIS DISK\\" while playing on Sony BDP-S380.  It works perfectly on my laptop's blu ray disc drive. The picture quality is good but the audio is just okay. NOT WORTH THE ENTHUSIASM.  All other bluray movies play perfectly on Sony BDP-S380. Only this particular movie is showing error.  BPD firmware is already updated through internet. I have requested sony to deploy new updated firmware to solve this problem.
B005JE7WKI|5.0|I waited for this to hit the screen for a while, only to find out it came and went :(  After seeing this, now I am really sad I didn't get to see it on the Big Screen.  I bought the screening video, and now I am going to by the actual Blu-Ray as this need to go in the collection.
0439023491|4.0|Liked this book, but preferred the first which was far more gripping. A good effort but seemed even more far fetched. Also, I felt there was not as much content, and some amount of repetition, especially at the end.<br /> Is it right to be exposing our teens to such books (but maybe that's a different topic altogether to address). Howvever, as a work of (science) fiction, a very well done series.<br />Looking forward to reading the last installment.

B005HSG3U6|3.0|Case is good for the protection factor but it 's not very good for propping up the kindle to watch video for the same reason others have mentioned already.  The cover is just too flimsy so don't expect to prop it up on your lap or anything.  Too expensive considering all of this.

B004EPYZSK|1.0|If the lead actors were no-names, I'd be more forgiving. But with big name stars, big directors, big promotion, one expects more.<br /><br />This movie is a complete gypt -- cheat, scam, fake-out, ... using big names to lure you into a really badly written, produced and acted movie. They didn't even bother to keep the scale credible. Big aliens when they're threatening the stars, tiny little spacecraft that the aliens can't even fit into, to save on prop costs. There are too many more inconsistencies to cite here.<br /><br />The plot is really stupid and derivative of the \\"Aliens\\" saga.<br /><br />Bad, bad, bad. Don't waste your money and time.

B000X2H8G4|5.0|I bought this for my elderly mother who has a hard time hearing the TV.  Since she started using it she can hear the TV while the volume is kept at a normal level.  It works so well that I occasionally have to turn the volume up now so I can hear it.  She can also hear better during conversations.  No more raising voices so she can hear.  This little gadget has really helped things become more peaceful.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Works great every time and never fails to keep me amused. Easy to use even for my kids. Totally recommend this app!
007174889X|5.0|Received within few days, in excellent condition. I guess I do not have to write about the book itself, if you are already in medical world. This is 'The ultimate book' for medicine.
B005I6EU7U|3.0|Interestingly, the product packaging does not say this is for a Fire unless that is the 'more' they mention. I am guessing I will grow to like this cover more but my first impression makes me think I should have waited for a better selection. The smell of this bothers me and makes my head hurt unfortunately. I am hoping it will 'air' out soon.<br />I personally like the tight elastics holding my Fire in place. I'm not worried it will fall out. Unfortunaley it has no place for my stylus/pen. It does not close all the way either. Perhaps with a little time it will relax and not gape. I noticed also that the gold embellishments are wearing off already. I've had it for less than two hours. It would look better now without that added touch. I like the embossing better. In a day or so it will most likely be without any gold!<br />Otherwise the stitching looks good and I'm fairly confident it will protect my Fire from damage.<br />It would be a better 'deal' at $29.99 rather than $39.99 (what I paid), maybe.

B0055V6EZE|5.0|For over 30 years now Hugh Laurie has been known as first a comedian in Britain and then as an actor for his work in the TV series \\"House\\". But all these years he has had a love of music in him that until recently had been kept a secret. A secret until Laurie released his debut album \\"Let Them Talk\\", his tribute to the New Orleans style Blues.<br /><br />There has over the years been actors who crossed over into the world of recorded music wanting to show off their musical skills. Some actors proved they had the abilities to carry a tune and others would have been better off if they had been prevented from being allowed in a recording studio. Then there is Hugh Laurie. He not only deserves to be in the recording studio but he's also good enough to make you wonder why he hadn't found his way there sooner.<br /><br />Laurie first learned to play music at the age of 6 on the piano. That lasted for three months or so but the love of music was planted in him. The passion for music would come years later when he discovered the Blues and especially New Orleans blues. Long story short it led to 2011 where Hugh Laurie released his first CD celebrating his love of the Blues. It is that love of the music that makes \\"Let Them Talk\\" so special.<br /><br />Too much of todays music has too much emphasis on having the right formula and hook to the music and filming a video to go with it that will sell a ton of records and make a ton of money for the record company as well as the recording artist. Image and style means everything and the music it seems a lot of times takes a back seat. The love of music has been over taken by profit and the bottom line.<br /><br />\\"Let Them Talk\\" is the total opposit of that. The album was made by Hugh Laurie not for the purpose of making a ton of money for him or the record company. Laurie made this album for the pure love of music. To pay tribute to a style of music he has a love for going back to when he was a young man. The love shows through every single song that appears on the disc. What really makes this album work is when you realize just how serious a musician and how good a singer Hugh Laurie is. This is no frivolous piece of work here. This is what music is suppose to be about.<br /><br />While some songs on the CD are better then others there is not a bad song on the album. Hugh not only sings but plays piano or guitar on every song as well. In addition to all that \\"Let Them Talk\\" also has some big name stars who come in to lend their talent to the record including Irma Thomas, Dr. John, Allen Toussaint and Sir Tom Jones (Yes that Tom Jones).<br /><br />In the end \\"Let Them Talk\\" will probably sell a few records but most likely will not go gold or climb high up the music charts and I believe that will be OK with Hugh Laurie. He didn't make this album for those specific reasons. He recorded this album just simply for the love of it. For the love of New Orleans and its kind of blues. He recorded it just for the love of music, the way music is suppose to be recorded.<br /><br />Speaking personally for me, this is one of the very best albums I have ever heard. EVER! \\"Let Them Talk\\" is in my top ten all time favorite albums list. In fact as far as I am concerned this is the best albun of 2011 and I would strongly recommend this album to anyone who loves music.sc.

B000V5SIFS|5.0|Deep Space Nine takes the prize when it comes to good story telling and better quality actors.  Much less of the technobabble that Voyager was known for.  DS9 excels at creating multiple story lines, some that end each week, some that span over many weeks, keeping the viewing experience exciting.  It is much better when viewed on DVD or on Prime than on TV, so you can watch more often and keep up with the story lines.  They probably did more in character development than the other shows as well.  Instead of running to a new star system each week, you get to experience the opposite, a stable (somewhat) environment of a space station visited by all the different species.  This means less filler characters, more story lines, interesting plot twists, and a complete plot that starts in the first episode, but doesn't finish until the last.  And of course, there is Quark, who is enough reason by himself to watch the entire series.
B003INBOEM|5.0|Ip Man is about a real kung fu master (who trained Bruce Lee). It's about the Japanese suppression of China during the 30's. The fight scenes were terrific, Donny Yen (Ip Man) is an amazing master and actor. Characters in this film seem real. The fight scenes between Ip Man and the Japanese are terrific.
B003JYOFIW|5.0|Quintessential Devo.  High energy electronic sounds, you can hear whispers of albums past made into something new.  Then went to see them live, and it was totally worth it.  This is their best album since \\"Oh No, It's Devo!\\"
B00005B36H|5.0|Let me just begin this review by noting that I have trained in classical music and spent one year as a music major, just to give everyone the perspective of where I'm coming from with this review. Also, 10,000 Days was the first album I heard, and was instantly hooked on it. After hearing 10,000 Days, a friend who also liked Tool gave me Lateralus, so I listened kind of backwards. But by this point, I own everything Tool has ever made and have listened to it many times over.  First, let me note that Lateralus is much more consistent than 10,000 Days, but in my opinion a tad less consistent than AEnima. However, a few songs really knock this album out of the ballpark.  The Grudge - a pretty solid opener, but it took me a few listens to really be able to appreciate this.  Eon Blue Apocalypse & Mantra - lumping them together for the purpose of brevity. Some of Tool's weaker transitional tracks, in my opinion. Unless you're listening to them in a really quiet place, you pretty much will hear nothing but empty space. If I'm on shuffle on iTunes, I most likely skip these.  The Patient - I really like this one. It has many different textures to it, some subtle and some more edgy and in-your-face.  Schism - too repetitive for my taste, even more so than The Pot off 10,000 Days, but I do appreciate the vocal harmonization.  Parabol - not worth much on its own, but contributes in a big way to Parabola. You can't listen to one without the other if you want the full effect.  Parabola - the first REALLY knockout track on this album. It's powerful and the lyrics are creative and moving.   Ticks & Leeches - it doesn't really do much for me. It's not awful, but it's not awesome.   Lateralus - what can I say about this song? How can I even describe it to someone who's never heard it? Life-changing? The most powerful rock song I've ever heard in my life? I'm sure the meaning of life is somewhere in this song.   Disposition - I really like it. It's a bit of a break for the ears afterLateralus, but it's mesmerizing in a way.  Reflection - hypnotic percussion, fascinating lyrics. Really a work of sheer creativity and a close second behind Lateralus for best song on the album.  Triad - one of the coolest instrumental works I've heard in the world of rock. A tiny bit repetitive, but the variation in dynamics and the percussion makes it one I want to hear.   All in all, one of the best albums I've ever heard, not just from Tool, but from any band out there. The thing is that there are about 3 songs that were good, but didn't grab my attention. But all the rest are complete knockouts. 3 years after first experiencing this album, I still find something new every time I listen to it. It never gets old. Worth every penny.
1250004217|4.0|When I first starting reading, I was mesmerized, captured. The story pulled me in immediately. After the first few chapters, I had to set the book down and take a break. It was too tough to read. The scenes were all too graphic, emotional. This was not a reflection of the story or the writing; just the unimaginable horror about to be described. I took the same approach in my own novel The Ruby Tear Catcher. Ms. de Rosnay is an excellent writer. Her use of the English language, intermingled with her French, including her reference to many things Parisian, took me away into a world I didn't want to be in. But the writing drew me in further and further. The flashback technique was well-done. The chapters were very short, I loved it. Overall, I highly recommend this book. Like many books, ending are very tough to write. I found the ending rather predictable, which left me a bit deflated. But at least there was closure. I also thought that Zoe, the little French-American daughter was unrealistically mature. And I guess I don't get it. Why would this woman, the journalist, be so obsessed with the Jewish family who once lived in the apartment she was to live in. I understand the discomfort with it but no the obsession that drove her to finding the family and confronting them. Sadly, in my opinion, she ruined lives. And the reason she did...selfishly wanting to let the family know her family cared about them. Overall, great read but be prepared for tears and admonishment for the Nazi era
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|When I rented this movie I was thinking &#34;I'm not sure why I am getting this movie, it will probably suck&#34;. I was thinking that because Evan Almighty and Get Smart the most recent Steve Carell movies that I can think of that isn't The Office (I know a tv show) or 40 Year Old Virgin was terrible.  I LOVE The Office, and thought he played Michael Scott amazing and the lines in 40 Year Old Virgin still make me laugh no matter how many times I can watch it. However, this movie is now one of my favorite movies. Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling friendship is what makes this story so funny. As their relationship progresses when Ryan Gosling's character helps Steve get his &#34;manhood&#34; back after his wife cheats on him and ask for a divorce. It makes the events that unfold at the end so much better. They are the perfect duo for this movie. However, I have seen Drive this year too and Ryan Gosling really can't do any wrong with films lately! Emma Stone is in the movie too. She must have had some of the best one liners in this movie. She delivered them so well that they were believable and hilarious. I love Steve Carells son's character in the movie too and what 13 year old isn't in love with their gorgeous 17 year old baby sitter. They are at that age. The only thing I didn't like about this movie was Julianne Moore as the wife. She didn't seem to me to be as well at comedic roles as the others. She did have the P-zaz that I thought she would. She was believable but she just didn't do it for me. I could picture other actresses instead. So with that being said I really can't express how much I loved this movie. I wish I could remember the characters names better but I was never good with that unless I watched a movie 20x and that hasn't happened YET.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|They don't make them better than this!! My only negative comment is that, while it played at the theater in 3D, here you will only get to see it in boring old 2D. If it comes out in 3D, snatch it up!!! This film is a never-miss extravaganza!!!
159562015X|3.0|A very interesting book that helps you find your strengths and focus on them. The used book is a great price but the 1 time use code is invalid. Overall, you really don't need the code if you read the descriptions. Great addition to any library.
B004EPYZQ2|4.0|I saw this movie at the theater with my kids and the entire audience loved it! My only caution would be to consider that they originally planned to film it in 3D. Without the 3D visuals of any serious movie today, it lacked something (my family agrees). Still, it's a fun movie I would highly recommend.
B000XR4OC0|1.0|Two weeks of wearing TOM's everyday and the shoes looked awful, I wrote to their corporate offices who were unwilling to replace or refund the price of the shoes. Dissatisfying customer relations for shoes that clearly cost pennies to make in China.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a great app especially on the kindle fire because of the big screen. Angry birds free is a great deal because it is free and you get all the levels like the paid one!
B005U9RXWE|5.0|A must watch TV show, multi-dimensional characters, incredible character development from the first season to the last one.  This show never fails to shock and surprise.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|Very cool app.  I really like being able to transfer files from across the room without having to plug into the usb port.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is pretty fun and it has some hard games and some easy ones. plus, it didn't cost anything!
B0049OSQ18|5.0|I recently heard 'The Calamity Song' and 'This Is Why We Fight' on a local indie rock FM station (V107.3) here in the Cleveland area, and I got drawn into the music (watched some of their videos on 'YouTube' too). So much so that I decided to purchase their CD on the strength of these exposures. I really am enjoying the quality of their songs/melodies, and like the folk-country influence as well. Very well done and organic without sounding contrived. Great band!

B004HAG40O|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums from 2011. The Decemberists really hit the ball out of the park on this one.
B005K2YTG4|4.0|This part review is for the [[ASIN:B005K2YTG4 Timbuk2 Kindle and Kindle Touch ENVELOPE SLEEVE, Grey/Cold Blue]].<br /><br />I bought this item for myself in a batch for Xmas this December, two of each of the selected items, one for me and one as a gift for my sister. I love that my brand new [[ASIN:B005890G8Y Kindle Touch, Wi-Fi, 6\\" E Ink Display - includes Special Offers & Sponsored Screensavers]] fits perfectly and snugly, which i love, since my kindle won't be sliding up and down inside. The sleeve is flexible but still sturdy enough to give support when the device is in, plus has enough padding to protect the kindle but not enough to make it too bulky. Looks and feels well constructed, and the Velcro works fine. The size fits perfectly in my purse (which is on the small side, however it is a baggy, jean purse so that counts). I also switch a lot between my purse and my backpack (with all my college books in it) and i feel that my kindle will be protected from the hassles of living in either one while i'm walking around.<br /><br />I'm docking a star for the following:<br /><br />I have to point out that the one of the grey colors looks slightly different from the picture. The sleeve, when placed with its front to you and on its bottom (the flap opening upwards), has a dark (jean-like) grey color on its left, a beautiful sky blue on the center, and a light grey on its right. The Light grey looks more like a dirty grey vs the color in the picture, making it look a little off; my father, when he saw it, kept calling it cream color (he said the grey-blue-cream sleeve). In addition, the light grey color feels like plastic compare to the rest of the case which feels like a piece of canvas cloth.<br /><br />Something i would have love for this to have (and it would have been extremely convenient too) is an small outer pocket or something of the like. A place to keep the USB cable and wall power adapter safe and together. As it is, my cable is dancing from surface to surface while not in use and it can easily get lost. I don't think that there is a case for the kindle touch out there yet that addresses this issue; if it is and you've seen it please let me know on the comments, that would be a great fix.<br /><br />I also bought the same sleeve but in another color but as a gift for my sister:<br /><br />This part of the review is for the [[ASIN:B005K2Z2O2 Timbuk2 Kindle and Kindle Touch ENVELOPE SLEEVE, Black/Gunmetal/Red]].<br /><br />Like I said above, the construction of the item is exactly like i described before, perfect for the kindle touch and very protective of the device.<br /><br />The only difference is the color scheme. The colors in this particular item are very deep, rich, very dark colors, which makes it look amazing and my sister loved when she saw it on Christmas morning. The material seems to be canvas.<br /><br />Like with mine, a small outer pocket or something of the like would have been an amazing addition.rface while not in use and it can easily get lost.

B004EPYZUI|5.0|This movie was full of great surprises! Amazing acting and great story line! Blu-ray was awesome! Worth the money! Thinking about buying it for a friend's birthday!
B002C6A6N6|1.0|Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman: The Complete Series  Dreadful. Soundtrack in too many segments is not synchronized with picture. Too distracting to watch at those times. The person who edited the series to this should be fired. The person whose lips are moving should match the soundtrack. If there was a selection of less than 1 star that is how I would rate it. I copied this review but agree with it 100%.  I have since read several reviews that are similar.  The first complete set we received did all of the above and every DVD package inside of a sealed cardboard case was not sealed and index was inside season one.  The replacement we got was sealed on the outside, and each season was also sealed with the index loose inside box.  We had gotten someone else's returned set.  This was our first purchase from Amazon that had so many problems and may be the last.  Am sending it back for a refund this time.........
B0034G4P94|5.0|Two underdogs grabbing for the brass ring, a $5,000,000 winner-take-all MIxed Martial Arts tournament, that's way beyond their reach. \\"Tommy\\" is a loser, a Marine deserter using his dead mother's maiden name. Tommy has enough anger for a battalion of PTSD veterans, and a special reserve of anger for his father, a boozer who apparently abused Tommy's mother until she ran away with Tommy in his teens. Tommy has a Pittsburg PA accent to match Sly Stallone's, and a nihilistic slouch to shame Jon Voight. But Tommy is a Raging Bull in the cage, a born batterer who taps out his first two opponents in the \\"Sparta\\" tournament without breaking a sweat. He looks like the underdog you'd want good odds on.<br /><br />The other underdog is Brendan, a happily married family guy, a high school physics teacher whose students actually treat him civilly. He's well-spoken, decent, personable, but his home is about to be ripped away from him by a bank foreclosure. He loses his teaching job when he wins a MMA bout at a local strip club. Despite his wife's anxieties, he decides that training for MMA matches with reasonable purses is his best bet to save his home. The \\"Rocky\\" side of him will become apparent when he gets bashed and bloodied to hell and back fight after fight yet always comes up with a way to win. In spite of his calm teaching demeanor and general nice-guy manner, Brendan also has a seething pot of anger against his father, with whom he chose to stay when his mother jumped ship.<br /><br />But the gimmick here is that Tommy and Brendan have the same unforgiven father and the same dead mother. Is that clear enough? They're brothers who were separated as teens, one with Mom and one with Pop. They're \\"alienated\\". In fact, they seemingly hate each other's guts. If it isn't obvious to you, dear cinemaphile, that the two brothers will advance through the tournament and duke it out in the final scenes, you'd better stick with the films in the \\"family entertainment\\" section. The suspense of this film is over which of the brothers will 'cave' to his emotions and throw the fight to the other ...<br /><br />There's a lot of formula boxing film stuff in \\"Warrior\\" -- stuff that plays the same whether the combatants are MMArtists, mud wrestlers, gladiators, or barroom brawlers. The only thing that saves the film is the grittily convincing acting of Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton as the Conlon brothers. Good ol' Nick Nolte does a decent impersonation of an emotionally shattered failure of a father who has been twelve-step sober now for 100O days. The acting is strong enough to carry the film despite its twin flaws of improbability and predictability. It gets five stars from me for the very simple reason that I enjoyed it. We needn't worry about whether I was in an unusually good mood.<br /><br />Some reviewers have declared that the MMA fight scenes were poorly done. I wouldn't know. I've never seen an MMA bout, not even on TV, nothing more than a minute or two while channel surfing. I kinda thought it was comparable to \\"wrestling\\" on TV back in the 1950s, more theater than sport, but apparently I was mistaken. People are really doing grave bodily damage to each other for your and my entertainment. Me, I'd rather watch my ten-year-old niece's ballet recital, and I'd much rather listen to a Beethoven symphony. But Beethoven makes an audible appearance in this film; Brendan's  trainer uses Beethoven recordings to teach his fighters self-composure, and Brendan enters the cage to the tune of Beethoven's Ode to Joy. Meanwhile, Father Conlon soothes his nerves by listening to audio tapes of Moby Dick. It reminds me of Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood quoting William Butler Yeats in \\"Million Dollar Baby\\"....<br /><br />Wait! I get it! Something for everyone! We ballet/Beethoven fans are supposed to be suckers for a soupçon of pretentiousness.is over which of the brothers will 'cave' to his emotions and throw the fight to the other ...

B005ZUR724|1.0|Order and Chaos Online was a fantastic game, deserving a five star review, rfor the first couple of days that I could play it. But now that there is an update that nobody can find, the game is literally unplayable. I can't even get past the log-in screen! As soon as this update becomes avaliable on the Amazon Market, I will change my one star review to five stars.
B00006LI26|5.0|If your like me and get a hankerin' for some Teutonic Head Bangin' Speed Metal from time to time, this is usually one of the first discs I turn to.  Mind you, this is not the silky-smooth Michael Kiske or Andy Deris fronted Helloween, this is the speed metal/borderline thrash Kai Hansen fronted Helloween.  Somewhat roughly produced, with Kai's nasal vocals, I have heard it takes some people awhile to \\"get\\" this album.  I don't understand those people, I guess.  There is nothing here but blazing melodic riffs, screaming vocals, winnowing bass and pounding drums.  I challenge you to listen to \\"Ride the Sky\\" or \\"Victims of Fate\\" and not snap your neck head-banging or blow out an ACL rocking down with your air-guitar.  Oh, and the guitar solo's are a thing of majesty, words cannot do them description accurately.  Just get yourself that new two-disc re-issue of this, quickly!
0545403359|5.0|Excellent book, pretty much a remake of Black beauty only in a different world.    I haven't read a book very often that needed tissues while you read,This happens when we put human emotion to the thinking of a horse.As a horse lover and owner I get caught up in that. I probably will see the Movie, (With Tissues).
B000J5XS3C|5.0|My Requirements:  I wanted to incorporate a Karaoke system into my current home theater, which includes an xbox360.  I also wanted to keep the budget for everything under $100 and get something with good sound quality that I could later use with an electronic keyboard.  Finally, I wanted to incorporate the free youtube Karaoke videos and save money on songs.  This affordable mixer was the best solution.  Review:  It's doing everything I need it to do.  Since I am using an HDMI cable, I needed an audio adapter for my xbox360 ($4), otherwise you can just split out the RCA output into the mixer, bought a pair of Pyle Pro VHF cordless mic ($29), and the output from the mixer went to the Amp/Home theater.  No cables are included and it will run you about $8 on Amazon.  You can use anything that will stream youtube such as a PC, Roku, Wii, etc.  Use the television or PC for the lyrics.  Youtube has a lot of Karaoke videos with lyrics.  BTW, the mixer is plugged into my Home theater, so shutting off my Home theater will shut off the mixer, as the mixer itself does not have an on/off switch.    Material Quality - Unfortunately, I unintentionally did the drop test from about 3 feet on to a hardwood floor and it didn't leave any mark or crack.  The casing feels like it's mainly made of metal and the knobs feel pretty solid compared to the flimsy plastic knobs on my wireless mic receiver.  I'll leave the rating of the internal component quality to someone else more qualified.  Finally, there is no ventilation on the unit and if you follow their instructions, the unit should not need them.  So 4.5 star there.   Packaging - Unit was packed properly with foam and fit in the box tightly.  5 star there  Usability - How hard can it be to plug in inputs and outputs.  It does require some logic so a little brain power will be needed.  Sound quality - I am running this though my 8 year old Yamaha Home theater system and it sounds the same whether I route the RCA audio cable through themixer or bypassed it and went directly to the Home Theater.  Bottom line, it will also depend on what Amp/Home theater you are using in conjunction to the mixer. Haven't messed around too much with the EQ to give you an idea of how effective they are, but then again, I haven't had to mess with the sound.  So 5 star there.  Overall - It does produce some heat over time where the LEDs are located.  I've only used the system at no more than 30-45 minutes intervals and it gets pretty warm.  The instructions says not to place them over other electronics that will release heat, especially not on top of the Amp.  Since the unit is compact, it's tempting to place it over another electronic device in an effort to save space, but that will just increase its chances of overheating due to the lack of ventilation.  Also, for those of you living in really hot areas, you may want to pay particular attention to the ambient operating temperature requirements.  Yes, I would recommend this product.

B0055SWM08|5.0|Was very unsure of what this game would have in store for me but I love it. It's highly addictive and although it makes you use your brain sometimes, it isn't frustrating. And I could totally sleep to the music. Definitely worth the dollar and works great on my kindle fire so far.

1400079144|5.0|Since The Lost Symbol got so many mixed reviews, I didn't read it when it first came out. I seriously loved all of Dan Brown's other books and didn't want to be disappointed that one of my favorite authors had slipped. But curiosity finally got me and I picked it up... and haven't been able to put it down! I am literally confused when reading the bad reviews. This book, the story, the education, is FASCINATING. Dan Brown has an amazing mind to put together stores that weave themselves together so perfectly. I can't stop reading it and don't want it to end. Conspiracy theorists, those with open minds, those intellectually curious, you will love, love, love this book. I know this sounds like a ringer review. I do not know the author and won't gain a thing from writing this, but I loved the book that much, so don't be afraid to check it out. Dan Brown, please write more, I am anxiously awaiting!!!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This show is honestly the best show on television. Waiting patiently for Season 6 to come out since I just caught up, but it's sad to know there is only one season left.
B0063IH60K|5.0|a+ especially since it's free.  easy to use.  appreciate all the various tabletop and card picture options!  responds nicely too
B000V86OKG|5.0|The reason I love buying these shows on DVD is I can rip right through them instead of waiting in agony for every week's show. Now that I am caught up to season 6 and now waiting eagerly to buy that on DVD as well, I might as well relive the seasons again.   I love this show!
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I'm guessing the publisher simply fell asleep on this one.  But hey, c'mon: a paperback requires PAPER to be bought, INK to be used, and a huge factory which probably employs hundreds of people to produce a paperback - not to mention the shipping to get it into the retailer's stockroom, and sometimes, storage fees for pallets full of book cases.    On the other hand, the Kindle version of this book requires 1347k of storage space on a hard drive (not even 1.4 Mb), and a few seconds of bandwidth when sold to deliver the book over Whispernet or Wifi.  That's it!  I've got general complaints about the high prices of Kindle versions - but hey, Macmillan, this one is wayyyy over the top!! Not going to pay more than $4 for a Kindle version of an $8 paperback. I'm sure that price point would still leave a tasty profit margin for the publisher.
B003L77GH4|5.0|I'm too old to be watching this show and my friends roll their eyes when I mention it but I don't care - it's too good to care about such trifles. I read the books by L.J. Smith in high school and loved them then, so when I heard they were making them into a tv series I was doubtful yet ever so curious. After watching the first & second seasons and half way into the third I have to say Kevin Williamson (and the team) has done a fantastic job of adapting the books into this hip, fun, scary and sexy series. The banter is witty, the acting is surprisingly good (Nina Dobrev is fantastic as Elena/Katherine), the storylines are compelling and OMG - the eye candy is off the charts HOT! That being said the show is more than that. There is all the requisite teenage drama yes, but further into the series you get to see back stories of main characters who are centuries old so they have rich material there to work with. What surprises me most about the show is that even in its third season it's still fresh with fascinating new characters and more answers being revealed as new questions arise to keep you wanting more. The arrival of the Originals into the mix is particularly good, naughty-bad-fun good. I highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the vampire genre.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|Life<br />4 Discs, 10 Programs<br />David Attenborough is \\"Biology\\"! (Summary for Teachers)<br /><br />Teachers speak of teaching biology before and after David Attenborough in the United Kingdom. This is based on the impact of his earlier \\"Life on Earth\\" and \\"Living Planet\\" series. A younger David sat down among wild gorillas and personally dove in the Alvin into the abyssal ocean depths. Students held their breath as they came to hear biology in Attenborough's voice. The mere presentation of an animal's or plant's life has little story line.  Attenborough's personal involvement became the story line.  Several generations of students who saw life through his eyes shared his wonder.<br /><br />He has continued to be involved in additional nature series. He still appeared in scenes in \\"First Life\\" (bought by the Discovery Channel and not available in the USA).  But the release of \\"Life\\" and \\"Planet Earth\\" has ensured that biology will continue to be mentally pictured through Attenborough's seasoned voice, just as many generations of Americans viewed world news through the intonations of Walter Cronkite.<br /><br />Two audiences will perceive this high quality footage differently.  For viewers with significant outdoors experience, these smoothly transitioning segments are jaw-dropping. But for those electronics-addicted and nature-deprived youngsters, many of these scenes will lack \\"awesomeness\\" since the animation world has no constraint of being anchored to reality.<br /><br />Attenborough is no longer seen on-screen but his voice holds these ten programs together. The  photography is high-definition quality. New technologies, including gyro vibration-damped helicopter cameras, now make available perspectives that were not possible a decade ago.  From satellite to microscopic imagery, it is difficult to imagine how biology will ever move to a time \\"beyond Attenborough.\\"<br /><br />Even if Attenborough is not \\"in the picture,\\" segments called \\"On Location\\" at the end of each of the 10 programs provide a story line of the camera men and women's adventure that should grip even the electronics-addicted students.<br /><br />While some teacher editions in catalogs are \\"teacher-proofed\\" for undertrained biology teachers, the following outline is provided for the professional biology teacher who merely needs to excerpt a segment relevant to their biology coursework.<br /><br />John Richard Schrock<br /><br />CHALLENGES OF LIFE 1) Opening footage is probably the most impressive, featuring bottlenose dolphins making circular mud walls with their tails and driving a shoal of fish to the air where the group lines up to harvest them with mouths wide open; 2) in Kenya, three male cheetahs take down an ostrich by hunting as a team; 3) Madagascar chameleon uses tongue to capture many insects from a distance, in slow motion; 4) Antarctic crabeater seals versus orca killer whales; 5) open ocean shoals of fish are decimated by swordfish while flying fish take to the air to evade predators; 6) brown-tufted capuchins in Brazil use rock and anvil to crack mature palm seeds; 7) Venus fly-trap has hairs, two must be touched within 20 seconds to trigger closure; 8) stalk-eyed fly in Malaysia emerges from pupal case and its eyes must grow apart in males, showing their use in combat; 9)in dry season in Zambia, hippopotamuses move to deeper river areas and males fight for dominance; 10) courtship of Oregon grebes concludes with beautiful \\"dance\\"; 11) Northwest Pacific octopus lays eggs in den and cares for its eggs until it dies; 12) Costa Rican poison arrow frog moves each of six tadpoles to canopy, each to a separate bromeliad and then repeatedly returns to provide an unfertilized egg as food; 13) fledgling chin strap penguins in Antarctica must make their first swim while a leopard seal takes a few as a meal; 14) orangutan mother and baby.

1451627289|5.0|I admit this is the first King novel I've read in awhile. At one time I was a big fan but I got where Mr. King was way to wordy for my taste.  This novel is still a little more descriptive then I needed though I have to admit it held my attention. I'm not sure that a younger audience then myself ( I was born 1948) will appreciate and enjoy the past and future references as much as people in my generation. I am one of those people that can't see much sense in watch movies or reading books that you already know the ending (example the Titanic) so I was pleasantly surprised in how Mr. King presented the history of this era and its stories.
B005ZUR724|1.0|amazing game, but dont buy for the Kindle Fire. Amazon (or possibly  Gameloft,  or both)  does not update the game in a timely manner,  leaving it unplayable. if someone were to pay 6.99 for this app today, they would not even be able to play it because this isn't the newest version.
B003IEJZUG|1.0|Recently assigned as a school assignment for my daughter. I had read a few years ago. This had to be one of the dullest and most inane reads I ever finished  The entire AP English class had the same view. Do noy ask anyone to read this.

My two daughters and I love the series.  I love that I can enjoy something that my girls enjoy.  It helps us to have fun things to talk about other than chores and school.  I love that we can all enjoy these books.<br /><br />In this book, we \\"find\\" Percy Jackson and get to see what has been going on with him.  I don't like spoiling books, but I will say it doesn't disappoint.  The only thing I wanted when this book finished is the next one!!!  My daughters and I can't wait to see what happens in the next book.

B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|I know little about baseball, but I quite liked this movie. It is the true story about how Oaklands Athletics manager Billy Beane (a fine performance by Brad Pitt), facing the loss of some of his best players after the end of the season, and with very little budget to hire good replacements, decided to apply statistical methods to find good but undervalued (and therefore, cheap) players. By traveling this path, he gets the opposition of much of the official baseball establishment (though this should not be exaggerated). To help him in this endeavor, he hired a young university graduate (played by Jonah Hill) to whom he soon becomes a mentor, introducing him to the business side of baseball. With these methods, Beane assembled a team for the following season that, while was unable to win the championship, did make it to the playoffs, and generally did much better than expected initially.  The filmmakers are honest enough not to show Beane as a completely nice guy. He has a bad temper. He is cold and aloof with the players (he never travels with the team), refusing to become friends with them, in order to be easier to fire them. It is hinted that he wasn't that good as a husband. Despite these flaws, he is a compelling, generally sympathetic character.  The movie basically believes that human intuition (in the form of the aging scouts) is no match for the mathematical and statistical methods of young nerds. If one has the romantic notion that not everything in life can be quantified, and that in some fields the human brain can still do better than a computer, then one feels oneself to be on the other side of the argument proposed by this movie.  Also, although I'm not very knowledgeable about baseball, it seems to me that the changes proposed by Beane (no stolen bases, emphasis on reaching first base and not taking unnecessary risks) makes for a duller, if more standardized, game. So whether the end result of these changes he proposed made for a more entertaining game, it is debatable.  But despite the fact that I was a bit uncomfortable with its thesis, I did like and enjoy the film.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|This movie is different from the various films done about Queen Victoria in that it focuses on her earlier life as a princess and her early reign as Monarch.  While it doesn't go into great depth about the succession and who is who, we do get a glimpse into what her life was like under the influence of her mother, the Duchess of Kent and Conroy as they tried not only to shelter her but to take advantage of her youth and inexperience and try to force her to make her mother the regent.  Albert enters her life as a potential suitor but he becomes much more and turns out to be her ally and confidante.  The chemistry between Emily Blunt as Victoria and Rupert Friend as Albert was evident in all the scenes, especially when they are playing chess and being watched by the various advisers in the room.  Victoria speaks of herself as a pawn and Albert tells her that she must learn to play the game better than the people who are trying to control her.  We see the frustration that Albert experiences in early marriage when he feels \\"like a guest\\" rather than a husband and partner.  Victoria learns to rely more on Albert for assistance in her duties and of course, this is the all time great love story especially in the era when arranged marriages were just that.  There was definitely love and devotion in this union.  It was sad that Albert died at such a young age and Victoria mourned him for the rest of her life.  As usual with British films the sets were splendid and the 19th century clothing and hairstyles were wonderful and accurate! The other element that I thought was well done was that they  showed  Albert in his native environment speaking German(English Subtitles.)  I don't think I've ever seen this in another film about Albert and Victoria.  After all German was his first language!

B003VANOFY|5.0|I've been looking for a decent pair of wireless headphones for a while and these have fit the bill. I use them a few hours each day for listening to music, gaming, and Skype/Go To Meeting calls. All of the uses sound great. The wireless signal is strong enough that I can wander around my house and not drop the signal. Others say that I sound clear.  My only minor complaint is that they get a bit uncomfortable if you wear them all day. I've found that the top of my head gets sore. I've had this problem with any headset I've ever owned. As the padding gets a bit softer with use this may change. They're certainly never painful just not comfortable without moving them around a bit so that the pressure is on a different part of your head.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Afer recieving my cover, I was very concerned about the extreme tight fit and the fact that it didn't lay completely flat.  It began to make me wonder if it was really meant for the Kindle Fire.  I went back to the website to double check that I hadn't purchased the wrong type of cover.  I scrolled down and read the \\"manufacture discription\\" and I'm so glad I did.  It explains why the tight fit with the straps and the fact that due to the durability and quality is the reason why it doesn't lay flat \\"immediatly\\".  Like a new good book, the spine takes just a little time to relax. It all makes sense and reassures me that I made the perfect choice for my new Kindle Fire. And to top it off, the looks are wonderful too!  I highly recommend this product, and to read the manufacters description.
B0045JEPXU|5.0|What a great CD. Pitbull has returned to his roots, Miami party music. This much appreciated return to the Pitbull we all love is very welcome. Smooth beats, nice lyrics, easy to dance to. I'd suggest it.
0399250573|5.0|The book was shipped in great condition and it arrived promptly.  Love the fast service! We will shop Amazona again!  Thanks!
B0021L8V0W|5.0|Great movie.  I saw it twice at movie theater, and have always wanted it.  If you like Angela Jolie, and you want a very well acted, very good action movie, this movie was great.  Amazon, shipped it out right away, I received it very quickly, much faster than I had expected.  Made a great Christmas gift to myself.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I bought this cover for my Kindle Touch WiFi. It fits perfectly and looks beautiful. I can't stop touching the cover it has a very soft feeling to it. It is Simple, Beautiful, and does it job. Highly Recommended.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this has been a great app for both my wife and me. niether of us use WiFi in chursch and it still works flawlessly. I am running on EVO and she on a Google Nexus. it does need permissions to access and then post versus to Facebook.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Received it in mail yesterday. Fast delivery, nice package and awesome product. It is exactly what I was looking for. The stand couldn't hold stable before I put Kindle into the cover, but it works very well after Kindle Fire is attached into the cover.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Addicting to try and get as many points and beat old scores. I haven't yet found any multiplayer games on here which might be fun.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|\\"HARCHI, A DOGS TALE\\", arrived in Rapid time, Extremelt great Packaging. Purchased 3 of these ..one for ourselves and 2 for our Public Library. Wonderful to do business with.

B0063IH60K|5.0|if u like solitaire games this is for you. fun and additcing!! worth downloading!  and its free what more can u ask for?
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I had not heard of Matthew Macfadeyen prior to watching this movie. I have to say that I have been searching for just about everything since. Very well done. I have not read the book so I cannot say if it is true to the book but still a great movie to watch. I would definately suggest to a friend.
B00006EXL5|5.0|Can someone PLEASE explain to me why this is 104 dollars?? I would really love to but all four physical cds before become totally unavailable and I can't buy this with it being so much money! Can someone who bought this explain to me what makes it so special that they feel the need to jack up the price to some ridiculous amount?!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|A great game to play to unwind and relax.  The challenges build with each level.  Even my 8 year old loves it. Worth more than the 99cents!
0956494242|5.0|One of Austen's masterpieces is enough, but Niroot Puttapipat's illustrations make it all the better. Each full illustration is delicate and charming with gorgeous colors and lush textures. The black-and-white ones are equally beautiful - anyone that loves reading his version of \\"The Night Before Christmas\\" to their children will recognize the style.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I got my product quickly and in new and great condition. I would definitely order from them again! Thanks for the service!!
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I was very surprised how much I would enjoy my Kindle Fire Cover. The cover is a vibrant red and soft to the touch. It is easy to handle and the front cover easily bends back for comfortable reading. The price was very affordable and I would recommend this product to anyone.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This is my favorite Batman movie yet. Jokers performance is great, Ledger's role is definitely one to remember. Must see
B005HSG3TC|4.0|This cover protects the device without adding bulk or weight. I carry my Kindle in my purse everywhere I go, so this is important. My only reservation is that it does not always stay stable in the standing position. I've tried the recommendation to use the elastic band to secure it, but this causes the cover to bend and I'm a bit worried about it tearing. Otherwise,  it's just what I was looking for.
B002ZG981E|5.0|So I've seen this movie countless times and always find a different edge on it. Its a great plot with twists throughout. Definitely a keeper and the picture quality is stupendous
B002U0KHMY|5.0|I have fallen in love with this show. Not only are the charecters fun, engaging, and a joy to watch, but the plot lines are great. The dynamic between everyone is well thought out and fun to watch. I'm no show expert, but I would highly reccomend this show to anyone who likes entertaining tv. It's funny at the right times, with just the right amount of drama. Love it!
B004A8ZWVK|1.0|The  HELP DVD only I purchased will only play half way through then cuts out   so infact is defective .
B0055SWM08|5.0|Love this game! It looked bland from pictures on the appstore but I tried it based on all throw good reviews.  So glad I did! Addicting!
B0034G4OQS|5.0|For me this will be a quintessential holiday movie like A Wonderful Life or Charlie Brown Christmas. It hits so many notes that it is fully deserving of being a full length movie.  We all have aging parents (even centenarian ones), and this wonderful movie asks the questions when is it time for an aging parent to step aside, and who/which child, is the appropriate heir to a dynasty (timeless questions - see The King's Speech), with humor and understanding. With our world turning over to 7 Billion people, it is high time the legend & logistics of Santa get an update -- as Steve, one of Santa's full grown sons knows only too well.  The old wooden sleigh and 8 reindeer are stressed to get the 'job' done in these times of GPS and satellite tracking.  But the older generation has difficulty handling the technical upgrades, and doesn't even seem to see the point when the old-school methods worked just fine back in the steam-era. Mrs Claus is no slouch herself, but doesn't get any sort of recognition. Many a family in today's world has faced just the same familial stresses, not to mention many dynasties over the centuries (see The Lion in Winter).<br /><br />Combine familial issues of the modern age, with the sentimental message that every child matters -- around the world -- and you have a poignant and relevant message for the holiday season, one that will resonate for years to come, and is suitable for children of 'all' ages.<br /><br />This will be a movie I expect to enjoy for the rest of my life.
055357342X|2.0|I'll keep this review short...  Having read the previous two books, I think I gave this series enough chance to impress me. The best that can be said about this chapter is that it has some very jaw dropping twists and turns. Major characters get wiped off, and other characters launch into considerable growth both in personality, as well as in position on the chessboard. However, I found myself skipping over too many pages just to get to the good stuff. The book is filled with too much filler and fluff disguised as \\"details\\". Forgive me, but I like getting to the point. The books could use a little cutting and editing.  I will keep \\"in touch\\" with the series through HBO from now on.
B006LL0UZW|5.0|Realized how much a review might mean for you! I followed your 365 days project. This book continues from that. I bought the Kindle version and totally with the nine dollars I spent! You are funny too. Every page had a laugh or two
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy playing this version because it allows me to posy the game how I want to play, instead of giving me hints or telling me where to place cards.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its okay the controls are hard to use, but most of the games are easy, I wouldn't suggest for a paid game, but for a free game its okay
B0063IH60K|4.0|While the game is OK, the ads are annoying when you start a game because they don't always delete when tapping the close X. So annoying I plan to avoid the advertiser.
B0011HF6GE|5.0|This album absolutely destroyed me. A good friend of mine gave me several albums to borrow a few months back, and while i put them all on my itunes, it took me a while to get around to all of it. One day, while in art class, i decided i would listen to some new music while i was finishing a drawing. I moved my usual very social self to the corner of the room and by chance decided that the album i would listen to today would be Bon Iver's \\"For Emma, Forever Ago.\\" 30 seconds later i was frozen in my seat. by the end of the first chorus of the album opener \\"Flume,\\" my eyes were staring wide open at absolutely nothing, and my jaw was limp. Needless to say, i didnt finish my drawing that period. About a week later i went out and bought a hard copy of this album, because i simply had to own it for myself.  What Justin Vernon has crafted with this is a rarity. It feels utterly familiar and nostalgic, yet at the same time breathtakingly fresh and original. It is the rawest music i've ever heard. The album even seems to change with time. I first discovered it around the late spring/early summer time, and ive found it to be a totally new experience listening to it now that it is winter. If you don't know the backstory to the recording of this album, i recommend you wikipedia it. It makes the experience that much more powerful.   Most songs consist of Veron singing layered falsetto vocals over simple acoustic guitar chords, and some songs add little touches of miscellaneous percussion, horns, or ambient lead guitar here and there. The lyrics are fairly open to interpretation, and they have this amazing impressionistic quality to them. After a few listens, you can determine what almost all the songs are about in a very general sense, but the specifics are up to you.   I discovered this album at a really big time in my life; i was graduating high school, leaving behind old friends and creating new ones, clinging on to relationships with girls and mentors while being thrust intoa new city with new friends and new opportunities. This album really personified all of my bittersweet memories, fears and anxieties about the future, and love for the people i was leaving unlike anything else ive ever listened to. Each song has the power to take you not only back to when you first heard it, but certain songs take me back to certain times before i had even heard of Bon Iver, bring back certain smells and sounds i had almost forgotten. I dont know how it works, this album just drains me emotionally. \\"Skinny Love\\" is the perfect description of trying to hold on to a relationship thats been broken. \\"Re:stacks\\" is an absolutely beautiful song about coming to terms with your feelings for someone. \\"The Wolves\\" is the most powerful song about pain and suffering ive ever heard.   This is not an album to play at a party. It is not an album to get stoned to. I think the first time you listen to this album you should be by yourself, maybe on a long car ride or something. Listening to the album in its entirety is a must. Its an album to listen to completely sober, ready to confront your own personal demons and reflect on your past relationships, both good and bad, and push forward into a new future. 5 stars out of 5.   All of Bon Iver's other music is definitely worth a listen too. check it out.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|horrible game the update is awful. what kind of dumb update is that. liked it until the update. thinking of uninstalling
B0063IH60K|5.0|This solitaire game is perfect.  Just what I was looking for.  The graphics are nice and the game is easy to play. Love the auto complete!
030771652X|2.0|This quickly became one of those books where I'd finish because I'd started. It will get better.    Firstly there is nothing really wrong with the writing. It is the story itself I have issue with. It was recommended by several book review sites, clubs etc. For me it just missed the spot. So memorable I can only just remember the ending and I only read it this week.   Although it didn't take long to read I still regret reading it. Please read all reviews on it though, because I can clearly see, many enjoyed it far more than I did.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love cardgames &amp; solitaire is fun to play. While I'm waiting for laundry to be done or in the car on a long trip. I look to solitaire to pass the time.
0307279189|4.0|I actually came across this by accident. I really enjoyed this. I found it to be informative fun and quite an all round joy to read. I don't know how true a representation the stories were but the book certainly held my attention. The principal characters were also brought to life wonderfully ( so much so I'd really like to meet at least 5 of them). I have already recommended it to 3 friends with more of an interest in physical exercise than I.   I would actually read it again ( definitely if I ever took up long distance running).
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This app is great!  I hoped that it would be useful, and found it to be VERY much so...and FUN!  l,m keeping the rest to myself.  You absolutely MUST get this app!!!<br />UPDATE: 2/12/13.- I still truly cannot say enough good things about this app. It helps you to understand how wi-fi works and how having too many neighbors close together and on the same frequency/channel can interfere with each other while you pull your hair out trying to figure out what is wrong with what. Just as a \\"for instance\\", I found that every time I have a power fluctuation at my house, it causes my router to cycle to the highest channel; right where half of my neighbors are at. Without this app, I wouldn't know. To say nothing about getting back on the right channel. You can also check your signal strength to find dead spots, as well as where in your home those around you have a stronger signal than you do. (YES, this DOES sometimes happen!) Also the devs pay attention to user input and update when needed (or wanted). I can honestly say that EVERY TIME I turn on my wi-fi on, this is the very FIRST APP that I go to, just to make sure that everything is as it should be. I cannot recommend it highly enough. (You can even turn OFF the AD in the settings menu for a week or more at a time!!! WHAT MORE COULD YOU ASK???)  FIVE STARS PLUS!!!!!
B006P4FBUE|5.0|This piano fits my kindle perfectly, it comes complete with beats to play along with and various different instrument sounds to choose from. It is a very fun app everyone i showed it to loves it.
B003L77GGA|5.0|My son in law is a fan of smallville. He has the rest of the seasons on either dvd or blueray. This blue ray completed his collection.
B005ZUR724|1.0|I can not believe that a company would allow this kind of thieving to go on! No explanation no help and yet they continue to allow buying and downloading of this game. Customer service should be a priority! Shame on you too amazon for allowing this in your app store!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|This app doesn't work with my Pandigital tablet, but it says it's compatible...I love Angry Birds, and it makes me so mad that I was willing to buy it and everything just to find out that it doesn't work with my tablet... :( Same thing with Fruit Ninja.
B003WSFXKY|5.0|Great mix of covers. Carlos is Carlos! (so I can't find anything to be critical about here). You can \\"rock out\\" to the first 6 songs. Chill with some on the back end. I was suspect when I heard about Nas & Carlos together, but they pulled it off nicely and 'Back in Black' is probably my fav. I also liked J.Lang & J.Cocker. Slightly let down by 'Guitar Gently Weeps', but still overall it's a great CD. DVD is a nice plus for just a little extra. i enjoyed Carlos's humility & love for the music in the interviews.
B002ZG981E|5.0|One of the better movies I've seen in a long time. Be ready to use your head, though. This isn't a Dwayne Johnson movie.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I have this game for DS and I paid 20 dollars so I was happy when it was free on my kindle. I read the reviews so I wont upgrade the game. fun games. very addicting.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|control was difficult but if your bored it will take up your time. not as responsive as it could be and many times was left wondering how to control next game.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|great selection for a very inexpensive app. I cancelled my Sirius satellite radio subscription and haven't missed Sirius at all. tune in offers so much variety.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I have read over 30 bad reviews for this on here and I was scared when I got this, but I enjoyed it.  I don't see what people are complaining about. None of the changes that were made, I thought, hurt the films.  I have seen them in their original theatrical cuts (VHS) as well as with the added/extended scenes on DVD.  My only complaint is that the dialogue is significantly quieter then the music is.  Other than that I am happy with my purchase. Defiantly worth it for a Star Wars fan.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|While Dropbox is not currently marked as being Kindle Fire-compatible and therefore won't appear in the Appstore for Fire owners, it actually works just fine and can be downloaded directly from Dropbox.com.   When used in conjunction with ES File Explorer, you can easily move pictures and videos between your Fire and your computer without having to hunt for the right cable.
1932735410|5.0|Rita's PMP Study book is one of the best books available for preparing for your PMP exam. It is easy to use, very thorough, and actually makes studying almost enjoyable. Overall it is well written and is up-to-date.
B004478GNI|5.0|My Grand Son loves lego's...this kit was new to him..this was a surprise gift. He left me know he would do it later so the other kids would not loose the pieces...lol
0439023513|1.0|This book was simply abysmal. In fact, it was so bad that it made me want to go back and take stars off of the first two. I will not take the time to write a lengthy review, as it does not deserve to take another minute of my time.   Suffice to say, if you're looking for a book that completely changes the tone of a series, has a heroine who is anything but heroic or inspiring and instead mopes around listlessly and makes unexplained irrational decisions, and a \\"love\\" story that seems like an afterthought, then this is your book!   Bottom line, I want my money and time back. Suzanne Collins should be ashamed. She clearly wrote the first two with some serious thought and plot development, then needed another paycheck and threw up some words on a page, called it a wrap, and hit print.
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|This item arrived when it said it would and was in it's promised condition. My boyfriend loved his Christmas present!
0756404738|2.0|I am annoyed that I persisted to the end.  Some clever and illuminating sections, but deep character and plot flaws. Try Gene Wolfe's The Book of the New Sun (starting with Shadow of the Torturer, The Claw of the Conciliator, etc.) if you want to read a series in a similar vein but with deeper characters and a plot that moves briskly.
B00381PPEO|5.0|Another super record of a super group Down, this time with a touch of blues.   Aside from that it is still a good old fusion of Black Sabbath style heavy metal, southern rock and hardcore punk.   Phil's vocals on this record are a bit louder.   Those who are familiar with Down and Sludge Metal in general won't be disappointed.  People who haven't listened to Down.. better start to...  Should i remind that the band features a legendary Pantera vocalist Phil Anselmo?
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game to pass time...recommended for all ages. Love playing on my Kindle! Better than I remember solitaire being played. Great game.
B0015ABRE2|4.0|In the kingdom of television, where morals are blurred, what salvages serial killer Dexter Morgan is that irresistibly playful gleam in his eye. He comes across as just so likable. Okay, he also comes across as a vicious sociopath when his \\"Dark Passenger\\" is allowed to peek out. But the showrunners did a very smart thing by allowing Dexter to narrate his own story. Privy to his thoughts, we observe his wicked sense of humor, which he mostly internalizes. And no his humor doesn't necessarily make him \\"human,\\" but it makes him more relatable. Dexter is very much aware of his limits, of how he struggles with social cues. We note a strange thing. Dexter occasionally finds himself conflicted now, between the pull of his girlfriend and her kids and his murderous urges. This third season Dexter veers dangerously away from the Code of Harry. He lets someone in. It bites him in the butt. Very unconventional behavior for a neat, orderly monster like Dexter.<br /><br />Safe again is Dexter as this new season opens. Last season he almost lost everything when his bags of body bits turned up off the coast of Miami and the media dubbed him \\"The Bay Harbor Butcher\\" (a nickname Dexter considers crass). But Dexter managed to elude the FBI-led manhunt, managed to pin his dark deeds on someone else. It helps a lot that Dex is entrenched in Miami Metro PD, working as the blood spatter expert. So he escaped unscathed, safe again. Except that now, somewhere in Miami, someone is skinning his victims alive. Dexter's Dark Passenger is licking its lips.<br /><br />And yet it must be so vexing having to maintain a perpetual mask. If you have to summarize this season with a sentence, it may be: \\"Dexter makes a friend.\\" You almost can't blame Dexter's eventual caving in when the Assistant DA Miguel Prado (Jimmy Smits) extends a hand of friendship, what with Dexter having shown kindness when Miguel's brother was murdered (never mind that it was Dexter who murdered him). This series thrives on its character-driven story arcs, allowing the strong performances of its lead and supporting cast and its featured guest star to anchor the strange plot twists and turns. I've said this elsewhere, but Jennifer Carpenter as Dexter's insecure cop sister, Debra Morgan, is a stand-out for me. Carpenter expertly juggles her character's profuse profanity, bonehead impulses, her big heart and aching vulnerability. It sucks that, this time out, she gets saddled with a tepid love interest and an extremely annoying Internal Affairs officer who keeps nagging Deb to spy on her cop partner. Another bit of suck? The Skinner makes for a pretty weak recurring villain.<br /><br />Series 3 explores two particular themes. We see Dexter and Miguel's friendship blossom and then take a strange, dangerous turn. We also watch Dexter cope with the notion that he's about to be a father, what with Rita (Julie Benz), his damaged goods of a girlfriend, pregnant with his child. Can Dexter have it all? A convincing semblance of normality for him to blend in, as well as his extracurricular activities as Miami's unknown top predator? It won't be easy as Dexter finds himself torn. He genuinely likes Rita and her kids, and that pretense, that cover, is threatening to become the real thing. His Dark Passenger fights him every inch of the way, demanding that certain cravings be sated. Michael C. Hall and Jimmy Smits' give and take makes for compelling viewing. There's a certain gratification drawn from seeing Smits' playing against type, getting down and dirty and so fierce. Only, if you think Jimmy Smits' performance is the bee's knees, wait on Season 4 for John Lithgow's sublime turn as the Trinity Killer.s character-driven story arcs, allowing the strong performances of its lead and supporting cast and its featured guest star to anchor the strange plot twists and turns.

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Love it!!  It is very challenging.  Continuous fun and brain exercise.  Just couldn't figure out why when I tapped on matching tiles it wouldn't clear the board until after several attempts.  Maybe, it was trying to let me know not to choose those two.  I'll try choosing different matches and see if that is how it works the next time I play.
B004LWZW7E|3.0|The movie seemed like it was rushed to production or had financing issues because it was lacking on so many levels. The premise, while interesting, needed a lot more thought put into it. It's as if the genesis of the movie began with the idea of using time as currency and that meant a quasi futuristic setting and nothing else. I mean, all the basic elements are there, but that's just it, basic.<br /><br />I've watched enough movies to suspend my disbelief at will and can find enjoyment even amongst the most mediocre and it wasn't the story or the plot or the terrible acting by Justin Timberlake that ruined the movie for me, it was the editing and cinematography. Case in point, the part where Will Salas and his mother were running towards each other, great scene by the way, went horribly wrong at the end. Editor and director of photography botched it. Scene lost the crucial emotional impact it could have delivered and made a worthwhile cause seem fabricated. At the very least, show us Will's agony of losing his mother right in front of him, mere steps away, show us his mother's expression as she fell in the final second. Then there's the swim in the ocean scene, the bank robbing scene, the kiss in back of the car scene, the list goes on. Watch those scenes and tell me if they do not feel flat to you.<br /><br />It was only after the movie ended and the credits began rolling that I realized it was done by Andrew Niccol, this is the guy responsible for the brilliantly fantastic Gattaca, one of the most underrated, way ahead of its time movie. No wonder it had that similar vibe and look just a little darker and grungier. Anyway, it was quite a departure from that polished gem of a movie to this hurried mess. Props to costume designer, hair and make up artist for making Amanda Seyfried look amazing.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|The cover definately is a great protector for the Kindle Fire screen and is very quick and easy to use and install.  I'm kind of disappointed in the easel portion though.  It doesn't have a deep enough groove to keep the easel in position by itself; I have to hold it which is not the ideal situation since I should be able to be hands-free using the easel.
0062112430|4.0|This was the first book a bought on my Kindle and honestly I couldn't put it down. I had read Lauren Oliver's books before and I loved them so I figured I would love this one as well. It took me a while to get into the story at first but about 30 pages in I was hooked. I loved the sence of an alternate U.S. and I was amazed at how much I related to the main character, Lena. I honestly didn't see a lot of the events coming and it amazed me how descriptive Oliver was. I liked how she put background information into the chapter and when you thought there is no way to relate it to the topic she showed how it did. Overall I loved the book and (I know it's pathetic) ended up crying at certain parts. The only thing that I disliked was she got rid of a character at the end but still continued to write another book to the series. The character was such a huge part of the story and said character won't be a part of the next one?! I still would like to read the next book in the series but I'm not so sure that I will be as entertained/excited as I was with the first one. All in all, this is definately one of my favorite books.

B0059XTUEK|4.0|Marilyn Monroe was and still is a bit of a mystery.  In her heyday, she was considered by most to be just a glamorized sexpot used as eye candy in most of her films.  A look back generally shows she had significant acting talent, especially in the right roles.  As this film adaptation of Colin Clark's memoir indicates, Marilyn also comes with a lot of baggage.  Director Simon Curtis personalizes Monroe's struggles with confidence, older men and pills.<br /><br />The film is set in 1956 England where Laurence Olivier (a wonderful Kenneth Branaugh) is starring and directing \\"The Prince and the Showgirl.\\" Monroe (Michelle Williams), then one of the most recognizable people on the planet, finally arrives and drives everyone on the set crazy.  And we're wondering if she doesn't have a bit of crazy in her as well.  Some of these early scenes seem to drag a bit.  OK, we get it.  But I think, it does put Monroe in bad light and I suspect that is the idea.  Then Michelle Williams really goes to work.  Her ultimate relationship with Clark (Eddie Redmayne) brings out the real Monroe.  She was neglected if not abused as a child.  She didn't know her father, but all of her squires have been older men.  Now she meets a 23 year old (\\"almost 24\\" Clark insists) gofer on a movie set.  Monroe is 30 at the time.  After a tender kiss, she says \\"I've never kissed anyone younger than me.\\"<br /><br />Williams once again proves her acting chops in a stellar, award-worthy performance.  Her Monroe is vulnerable, needy and wants to truly be loved.  She wants a \\"normal\\" life and wants to have children.  These are not the same desires of her new husband, writer Arthur Miller (Dougray Scott) or any of her other previous mates.  As Clark had been warned by her former beau and agent Milton Greene (Dominic Cooper), Monroe is a heartbreaker.  But with Williams's performance, damn if I wasn't falling in love at the same time Clark was.  I just don't know if it was with Marilyn Monroe or Michelle Williams.<br /><br />This Blu ray is beautifully done, consistent with the fine film version.  It is presented in 1080p with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, nearly identical to the original release.  Low light details are well done.  Flesh tones are perfect.  The DTS-HD MA 5.1 is exemplary as well projecting the music properly as well as low volume speech.ams.<br /><br />This Blu ray is beautifully done, consistent with the fine film version.

B00004Z4SD|5.0|Released in 1999 to high critical praise, this movie didn't do well, coming short of its miniscule $10 million budget.  Still, I remembered it for some reason I got it recently.  Richard Farnsworth gives a remarkable performance in the true story of Alvin Straight and his mission to visit his estranged but seriously ill older brother.  Farnsworth was 79 at the time and had to play the 73 year old Straight.  Straight himself wasn't well.  He had bad hips, needing canes to walk.  His failing eyesight prohibited driving, so he decides to make the 300 mile trip across Iowa on his riding lawn mower.<br /><br />I know it sounds pretty farfetched and given the fact this was directed by David Lynch, one would assume he would meet up with aliens or something.  But Lynch holds back.  Even when Straight meets an assortment of Midwesterners, they all seem very real.  Along his weeks long sojourn, he must deal with his own devils and memories.  In one scene, Straight and an equally old man trade war stories in a small town bar.  Their memories of WWII are as fresh as yesterday and still weigh on them 50 some years later.  Straight reveals a secret he had never shared, one that he must deal with every day.<br /><br />I love this movie.  It moves slowly, like the lawnmower.  It moves deliberately like Alvin Straight.  It moved me.  Farnsworth delivers the writers lines brilliantly and while Straight wasn't an educated man, he has many words of wisdom.  In one scene, Alvin is talking with a couple of bicycle racers who are camping for the night.  One asks Alvin, \\"What's the worst part of being old?\\"  Alvin replies, \\"Well, the worst part of being old, is rememberin' when you was young.\\" Amen brother.

B003L77G10|5.0|We are in the middle of this season and love it! The acting is great, the show gives us lots to think about and the characters and plots linger in the imagination after watching.  We really enjoy the series uninterrupted by commercials and being able to watch at our leisure rather than depending on TV scheduling.
B004IK8Q86|4.0|This book was so different from many others in that the plot was second to the characters. The plot that is evident points us to the knowledge that we are a result of the choices we make and the things and values we hold dear. If you stick with this book I doubt you'll be disappointed.
0307949486|5.0|Since I started reading on the Kindle I haven't read that many print books. But when I saw The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo at a garage sale for $1.25 I couldn't resist, especially with all the hype. Wow, what a deal that was. This is a serious novel. The first 20 pages or so made me feel like a complete idiot! I kept wondering why everyone liked this book so much and if it was just over my head. There were a lot of foreign references and name dropping that was confusing. Don't let this discourage you. Once the story got going it was much clearer and really hooked me.  Mikael Blomkvist, a financial journalist, is in the midst of a scandal. With no prospects and facing some jail time, he accepts an offer to look into a 40 year old mystery; the disappearance of a young girl. Blomkvist does well on his own, but later enlists the help of a talented but strange investigator with issues of her own. I loved considering all the scenarios and trying to figure out the mystery along with the characters. The author made me feel as though I actually came to know Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander and I look forward to meeting them again in the other books. While writing this review I checked Amazon for some information about the book and author and was saddened to find out that Stieg Larsson died in 2004.

B003VS0CWO|5.0|This is the ultimate cult movie.  I have been to Rocky in the theaters many times over the years and the fun is watching the audience.  The one thing that is possible with the Blu-ray version is that you finally get to hear the entire dialog.  I'm not sure if that is good or bad.  One thing for sure is that Tim Curry's performance is superb.

B005ANZN3Q|1.0|I like Lang Lang as I have been following up his career for a number of years. As huge as his stardom is, he is not a great pianist (yet) as his artistry is still in the stage of infancy. Let's forget about his rock star status for now. In terms of pianistic capacities, Kissin is seldom matched. But I do take Lang Lang very seriously. Is he a showman? No. I think he is very genuine expressing his freedom within the right context of the music he plays. So, beyond the corny and superficial smoke & blue lights exhibited in this concert, he plays the music as it should be played based on his understanding and experience. Now let's get to the marketing side of the concert. In live concert, maybe those side shows such as flashing lights or blue smoke might excite younger generations who know nothing about classical music, but do make an effort coming to see Lang Lang live. In the sad days of claasical music with totally diminished audiences, we need to do whatever it taks to let young people experience the beauty of past treasures. In this sense, I give the promoter(s) 5 stars to pack young people in the concert hall so that classical music won't completely die away in another 5 years. But I do give the DVD one star for the viewing experience as the video director lost his sense of providing a sense of continuity of images matching the music. So, I needed to look away from my large TV so that I can concentrate on his playing AND music, of course.  My recommendation: Buy the DVD regardless to support classical music if you can. The music along is good enough to compensate the shortcomings of the visual presentation.

1451648537|1.0|The interviews with Jobs are fascinating and revealing. We get a real sense for what it must have been like to be Steve, or to work with him. That earns the book five stars despite its flaws, in that it's definitely a must-read if you have any interest at all in the subject.  But there are places in the book where I have to say, \\"Huh?\\"

B005ZUR724|2.0|I've been craving a good mmorpg for a while now, saw this one and gave it a shot. I expected some pay-to-play (p2p) features, as it's a low cost mmorpg, and while there are some features that require cash to enjoy, players are not required to purchase these items to fully enjoy the game.  The graphics remind me of ps1 but I purchased the game expecting worse and was pleasantly surprised. Controls are easy to master, though targetting allies can sometimes be a pain for monks.  There are tons of quests to keep players busy, as well as a wiki for those with questions or those with answers to post. The game is also free roam, and even offers PVP.  Cons:  Grinding is a key part of this game, no real way around it. The level cap for experience gain prevents power levelling and it's not uncommon to run out of quests before you're ready for the next region. This obsticle leaves players with only one real option, spending hours grinding exp from monsters. I don't mind grinding all that much, but for healers (my preference) grinding becomes more laborious than fun.  PVP areas don't require players to accept challenges from other players before they can be attacked. Simply put, you could be in the middle of a quest or looking over your map and get picked off out of nowhere by a random passersby.  All in all, I'd give this game a 4.5/5 but at the moment I can't help but give a low score simply for the fact that the game no longer functions. An update is required to play but at the moment this update is not available for download and thus the game cannot be played. My rating will change once the game is fixed; as a person with scripting and nodding exp I know how many things can go wrong and how much of a pain those things can be to fix, but I can't advertise for a broken product.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I do not know why people would give this game one star. I have it in my kindle fire for free.  everybody in my family is addicted to it, and it is great for ten year olds like me!  please! play! this!  game!!!!!

B0063GORYU|5.0|This game keeps me away from what I should be really doing. I highly recommend this app as it has many levels and difficulties.  It challenges you with one suit or all four, you will find yourself being sucked in hand after hand.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|at first I had the lite version of angry birds. I never knew there were so many levels on the full version. if u have money and spare time this game is a great game to pass time. while the lite version only provides 10 horrible levels. this provides 7episodes. each with about 40 levels on each episode. that's 280 levels of nothing but angry birds. this game is great!!!
B000067QMD|1.0|I've used Avent bottles since my daughter was born, and a Hygeia pump, and I've never had any problems with any of them.  I got these sealing disks intending to send bottles to daycare - I'm not sure what's wrong but I can't get a seal.  Everything leaks, whether it's the 4 oz. bottle or the 9 oz.  We tried snapping the disk into the ring as tightly as possible, and also laying it in more loosely before screwing down the ring, and in both cases, milk leaks out of the bottom of the cap, where the ring meets the bottle.  I'm really disappointed, since it would have been a great solution for us.
B006G2NVCA|5.0|Trent Reznor has come quite a long way.  Forever a fan of his Nine Inch Nails days, Reznor has gone from NIN mastermind to an Oscar winning composer, achieving the feat alongside Atticus Ross for scoring David Fincher's The Social Network.  Now, Reznor and Ross have scored Fincher's American adaptation of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, and the result is a beautifully haunting and atmospheric score that will send chills up your spine the whole way through.  This lengthy score is almost hypnotic, and is just simply brilliant.  All this, plus a hard-driving cover of Led Zeppelin's \\"Immigrant Song\\" featuring Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs is just the icing on the cake.  All in all, whether you're a fan of industrial-laced film scores or a fan of Trent Reznor, pick this up.  You won't regret it.
B005ZUR724|1.0|Does not works at all. Money lost.   I paid for this app, after that it started to ask for upgrade to play but there is no any upgrade to download.  So I paid for nothing at all. Very bad for amazon to sell non working paid aps.
B006C1DH92|4.0|I played this game and it is OK but Fruit Ninja is not my favorite game. I get bored with it too fast and I don't find it to be great fun after the first few minutes. For whatever reason I like to play physics games and games with a mental challenge. Just whacking fruit can only go so far. That being said, the game played fine and I didn't have any problems on the Kindle Fire. The graphics were OK and some of the challenges were interesting to try.<br /><br />I wasn't crazy about the link to the movie sight or to the being led to the Halfbrick site to see their other games for sale.<br /><br />I gave it four stars because it was ok and ran fine. The music was good and the voices added to the Puss in Boots theme. Just because it is not my style of game that I am interested in doesn't make it a bad game.
0307949486|5.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo or the real title \\"Men who hate women\\". To put it simple both titles work for this story.Journalist Mikael Blomkvist is hire to put to rest a cold case for industrialist Henrik Vanger, The case being who murdered his niece 40 years ago.Lisbeth Salander a complex super hacker is also brought to this case eventually and the 2 together will go through any effort to figure who murder who and why.<br /><br />What makes The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo so good is that the story is never boring, long, but not boring. Also the two lead characters may interest you, Lisbeth more than Blomkvist, the reason for this is cause by blomkfist way of doing things, while Lisbeth crazy yet sorrow life takes matters more serious.<br /><br />What I did not like about the book is the promiscuity that both these characters share, yes, they are both promiscuous, but sometimes its just too much, and it makes you think will this case ever be solve.<br /><br />But when it is solve you will be either shock,surprise,or mad. I thought this was a great read and I cannot wait to read the rest of the series.<br /><br />If you see the movies for the books either Swedish or American versions I highly suggest you read the books first they differ then the movies in some ways,<br /><br />This series is not for kids as well as the film so be warn adults only.<br /><br />What you should suspect from reading this book (SPOILERS):<br />Murder<br />Rape<br />Torture<br />Promiscuous Sex<br />Swedish History<br />Translated from Swedish to English so some mistakes, but if you can get through it, you will be fine.<br /><br />Enjoy.
B005NQ94KS|5.0|I've been reading some of the reviews on here and I can't believe what people have to say about this film.  I don't think it's \\"European\\" or a complete bore  -- it's a love story.  A love story with a unique twist at that, thanks to the one-day-per-year approach.  It's not a romantic comedy, but it's not all doom and gloom either.  And comparing it to Friends with Benefits?  Really?  That's like comparing a dirty, crumpled paper plate with food stains (Friends with Benefits..quite possibly the worst movie ever) to fine porcelain (One Day).  Just because Friends with Benefits takes place in America and was probably written by an American, doesn't mean it's representive of what American relationships are like...It's exaggerated cheap comedy.  If you going to base things off movies, then you might as well assume all Americans have lives like The Notebook instead.<br /><br />I'll be honest.  I don't like Anne Hathaway.  I especially disliked her as Jane Austen and I was dreading the reemergence of her British accent.  And for the first few minutes of the film, it does grate on your nerves.  But she's really likable as Emma.<br /><br />One reviewer said someone who watched this without reading the book might not understand the story.  And, really, although I'm sure the book is great and has a whole bunch more detail -- this isn't exactly mystery and unending complexities.<br /><br />The film isn't slow (it moves a year at a time!), but it's about watching two people grow up so there's not going to be any sudden chase scenes and whatnot.  If you like a bit more realistic romance between best friends, Jim Sturgess, and a tiny dose of nostalgia, then I recommend this movie to you.
1451648537|5.0|Great book.  A must read for anyone wanting to be an entrepreneur or executive.  Wonderful insight into what Steve was like and how he interacted with his team at apple.
B006LS7DQE|5.0|This is a high quality and fun game if you like the Puzzle Quest series.  I hadn't gotten a chance to play PQ2 yet so I took the chance with it for the Kindle Fire Edition.  Its a lot of fun and I would definitely recommend it as one of the better games available on the Kindle Fire.

I've been working with it for several months now (I was fortunate to get an advanced copy). I've been reading one chapter a week (ish) and then engaging with the homework in my daily life. The book has been a huge support in making positive changes in my diet, exercise, and even dissertation writing- I know that it sounds like a big claim but it's true. The information in the book rattles around in my head as I'm making choices all day long and it has had a significant cumulative effect in my life.  I've already recommended the book to a number of my friends and family members and am happy to do the same here.  The writing is clear and funny, the research is interesting and accessible, and the exercises are really useful. Highly recommend!
B002VPE1B6|4.0|One of those you must buy and watch again and again. Love the message behind it as well. Hoping they will make an avatar 2!
B000VDDWDS|4.0|The picture and sound on the Blu-Ray are amazing!  I watched this on a 55-inch with Polk speakers and it was truly better than anything you could hope for in the theater.  The disc is missing some of the documentary features that were included on the multi-disc DVD set, which was disappointing.  For that, I give this only 4-stars but for the film itself, you can't do any better.  This transfer is one of the best I've seen.

1552095258|5.0|I had been eyeing this book for a little longer than a year.  Upon receiving it, I was pleasantly surprised by an easy-to-read volume that weaves a bit of history into a discussion of the various aspects of paddle making.  You'll find discussions of everything from paddle designs to the characteristics of the various woods that may be used for paddle construction and a review of the kinds of tools you'll need to make a paddle.<br /><br />If you're looking for an absolute guide that walks you through specific steps to make one of a set number of paddles (e.g., a step-by-step instruction manual to make a specific design), you're looking at the wrong book (though it could be used in that manner).  Rather, the authors try to impart the knowledge that will teach you the overall paddle-making process, but then they leave a lot up to you.  You can stick to the templates in the book and use them to make a simple one-piece paddle, or you can use them as the starting point for making something that varies (a lot, or a little) from the designs contained therein.<br /><br />The book contains a lot of useful information about the subtler aspects of paddle making: the balance point, wood selection, wood matching, and many other topics. It also contains a list of contacts for purchasing suitable lumber.  [I've not had reason to use any of them, but I'm sure they'll be useful to some.]<br /><br />I've long had a desire to craft a paddle that is just right for me.  This book is the means of my pursuit of that desire.  If you've ever wanted something different from those paddles you find on racks at outdoor stores and outfitter shops, and are willing to put in a bit of time to make one, this book is a great place to begin.<br /><br />TOOLS?<br />------<br />While the book reviews the kinds of tools you can use, it spends little time providing instruction in how to use them.  Rather, it provides tips on how best to to use the tools you choose (e.g. how to establish two square edges if working with a planer, how a plane or spokeshave interacts with the wood grain), and provides some great instruction on making jigs and templates that will make your paddle-making easier.  If you are fortunate enough to have a band saw and a belt sander, you'll have some real advantages in your paddle making.  However, you can craft a paddle with basic hand tools (e.g., coping saw, combination square, rasps, planers/draw knives/spokeshaves, sandpaper), so don't think you need a garage full of gadgets to get started.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />-------<br />Even if you never plan to make your own paddle, if you love paddling, you'll find this to be a wonderful book.

B005UKJX4E|1.0|Sorry to say, but I didn't like this movie.  It was a noble attempt at making a movie with deep thoughts but I couldn't handle the split personality of the scenes from cosmos to earth which represent the grace and nature theme the director was attempting to recreate.  Also story libe was just too sad for me.

B001AQR3JY|5.0|We just got this movie for my kids for Christmas and they had never seen it.  My husband and I were so anxious to watch it since it was first released when we were kids and it did not dissapoint. The remastering on this movie was awesome.  The color was vibrant and the 5.1 sound was pure, clear and just amazing.  This is such a great movie for the family and people of all ages it captures your heart, draws you in and you can't help but fall in love with it.

Don't know where all the bad reviews are coming from. Looks \\"cheap\\" I guess you could say but is still very effective. Easel function works great (as long as the kindle is IN the case!) and the screen cover stays in place nicely when closed. Wouldn't want to drop it on the floor in the case, but that's not what it's designed for.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable cover for an already fairly expensive product.
B004G600A4|5.0|This movie is absolutely adorable.  Our entire family (including extended family...aunts, uncles, gmas and gpas) loves sitting down and watching this movie together.  There is one slightly \\"scary\\" part where the baby is stolen out of her crib which made my daughter worried that someone was going to take her for a little while. However all in all this movie gets 5 stars from me because it is so well done.  Great job Disney!
1594481717|1.0|A better title for this book would be \\"Things You Realize Just By Paying Attention.\\" This is easily one of the most boring books I've ever read. The author tells you nothing that you haven't already learned by paying attention to marketing and media for the past decade and a half. Not only that, he does so without humor or what I consider to be a narrative flow. I made it just over halfway through the book before I gave up.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|I downloaded Bible app as a back up because of the large library. I have disiscover this app is always running in thebackground. That is unacceptable so I deleted it.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|If you liked Starship Troopers, you'l like \\"Old Man's War\\".  It's a fast moving, well written book that gives us ideas on what could and should be done to make this world better. I enjoyed this book that was difficult to put down once I started to read it. Being on the wrong side of 70 years old, this is a book very interesting for me and the dialog is appropriate for the age of the \\"actors\\".
B004EBZX6W|5.0|well I think the wifi analyzer is a great thing to have. I mean it works good . its also cool because it picks up wifi signal I. all different places. plus. I got mine for free

B0063IH60K|5.0|It's essentially Windows solitaire on a pad. Ads aren't annoying, and the app has a pleasant simplicity to it without being cryptic.
B005C7SXMS|4.0|The life of Oliver Tate is glib. He's not popular at school, his parents are growing farther apart, and he's trying to find meaning in his existence. When a mysterious girl draws him into his first romantic relationship, everything seems to fall into place. Until a strange self help guru moves in next door and his mom seems to take a fancy to him.<br /><br />SUBMARINE is a hybrid of coming of age story, comedic drama, and experimental filmmaking. The story marches along in different parts, almost like a short story collection.<br /><br />Oliver (played by Craig Roberts) is a strange, albeit charming protagonist who himself is a combination of Walter Mitty, Max Fischer from \\"Rushmore,\\" and Paul McCartney (it's the hair and wardrobe.) He's aggravating in the beginning, but as the film progresses, he's actually funny and awkward. The people around him add to the awkwardness: his girlfriend Jordana, perceived as a quiet bully, has more story to her than she lets on. Oliver's parents are polar opposites who start off flat and never fully develop, which is unfortunate because there was a lot of potential for their plot. And seeing Paddy Considine in a mullet doing martial arts is a blast.<br /><br />The music fits in to the film with ease, gliding along with an air of longing and pretentiousness which spoke to me. Pretentiousness is overrated, yet I can't help but enjoy the songs which highlight Oliver's life.<br /><br />I enjoyed watching this; however, it felt like the film was trying to be over the top just because it could. This isn't necessary. I don't see the need to constantly be quirky when there is some good material in the first place. It's not bad though, just a detail which can be overlooked while you're watching. And this should be watched.
B004EPYZSK|1.0|This was our first movie to rent from Amazon and stream. No fault of Amazon's, but ouch - what a boring movie. My husband enjoyed it because he mistook it for campy, but everyone else thought it was just a too-long, dull story about cowboys, full of bad acting and punctuated by a few moments here and there of B or C special effects.
0439023521|5.0|It seems that I read one AMAZING book a year and the Hunger Games (trilogy) definitely was that book. The book doesn't grab you immediately, but once the action begins, its a real page turner! I have read the entire series in a little under a week. My only regret is not savoring the book longer. If you love a little science fiction or a little action, this book is for you. I say this as a fan of the Harry Potter series as well as the Twilight series... only now I think Hunger Games might have taken Twilights place on my list of AMAZING reads.   I truly loved the characters and am looking forward to the movie!
1400097029|3.0|Mr. Banville writes this story in an interesting style.  You have to pay attention to what is being said to understand when the narrator is talking of.  There are times when he is talking of his childhood, but the next sentence is about something that happened in the near past.  Maybe this is 'stream of consciousness' writing I have heard of?   The narrator is Max Morden, thought you have to look pretty hard to find it out.  He is telling  the story of his life of those he loved, so to speak, and, at times, others mention his name.  Once his mother asks why his future wife calls him 'Max' your name is ________., and he only says that that is the name he writes under, so that is the name she knows him by.   Max had a bad family life growing up and admits he may have not even loved his parents.  His Dad ran off, leaving his Mom and him to fend for themselves.  The main thrust of this story takes place in some seaside village, Ballyless, which is near Ballymore, where his parents rent a chalet for the summer holidays.  I would have called it a cabin.  I do not think it had running water and maybe not electricity.  The others of this story, the Graces, rented a house with all that and more.  He made friends with the Grace's children.  They were all about the same age, my guess is twelve (12), but they may have been as young as nine (9) or ten (10).   He also tells of his marriage to Ann, their child,. Claire, and how Ann died.  You develop the understanding he is still grieving for his wife who passed away shortly before he starts to tell this story.  The sadness is that he does not realize he is still grieving.  He is just going through motions and doing things, and you realize that he has not recovered form the loss yet, but tries to act like he has.  It sad to witness.   Another third of this story was written  of his life now, at the home of the Graces, the Cedars.  He has rented a room there, as does another gentleman, the Colonel.  It is late in the season, October, so the Colonel and him are the only tenants, along with the landlady.   This such a queer story in his writing style and the subject.  I read it because I wanted to see how it would end.  I, of course, had my suspicions of the developments, but why and when, etc.  It seems to me the poor man never does come to grips with his grief: life just keeps on rolling and takes him with it.   Upon further consideration, I find this story has been written as if he wrote down whatever he was thinking as he went through a day or two.  This is particularly noticeable when he rails against his wife for dying.  There is also the memory of childhood where he does not know his motivation, but realizes it must have been something children do or think at just those moments that he is contemplating.  I forget the exact instance, but remember thinking of how he is not judging the child he was, but accepts the choices he made as a child and knows that as an adult he may have chosen differently or thought of it differently: very cool reaction.
B0063IH60K|5.0|just got it for my Kindle Fire cant stop playing.  great when nothing to watch on TV. keeps the mind going
0439023491|5.0|This book is simply amaIng! If you read The Hunger Games and loved it then this book will make you fall in love!<br /><br />Each chapter will make it harder to let it go! It's a real page turner!<br /><br />I'm a gigantic The Hunger Games fan so trust me when I say... Expect nothing but the best!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely loved this entire series. The books had me on the edge of my seat and I could not put them down! The author puts you in the middle of the story and you feel the same pain, love, and fear that characters do. I would highly recommend these books!
0143038419|2.0|I was excited to read this book. I loved the movie & thought the book must be twice as good. I found it a little boring. I even tried to listen on cd, as I do with many books, but Liz's voice is too soothing. If I sat down to listen I would fall asleep. I don't think the book is awful, just not for me.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love these games great way to waste some extra time.the only thing I don't.like is how much point it takes to unlock the games
B0015DROBO|2.0|I didn't really like this book at all.  The story didn't get interesting until the last 1/4 of the book.  The descriptions are hard to follow.  I almost put the book down because it wasn't captivating enough.  I do not reccommend this book to anyone.
B0063IH60K|5.0|i love this app. solitaire is so amazing. i play it for hours on end. I'm definitley addicted. solitaire forever
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is so fun. I haven't put it down for 3 hours! I love the way it spreads out when you win!
B003EYVXYQ|2.0|The movie is not scary or horrifying or even exciting, however it is much more of a comedy. I disliked actors, even the ''kid'' that could easily get the gun from the hands of the national guardsman. They all act so macho, so brave, so careless and goofy, none of them seemed to be afraid. None of them seemed to care much if there was a zombie behind. They all seemed to be very fine among the living dead. Everyone could easily place headshots and it was all like:''Here is the zombie, okay let's play with it, have fun and then it's either headshot or flare in the body or you name it''. What do people on an island do with zombies? They are chained and their sole purpose is to live among living like they used when they were alive. The postman zombie, the cooking wife zombie, Romero, that's just not you. What about the guy who bit the fingers off the zombie? Didn't he know he could have swallowed the blood? The fisherman who catches zombie in the water? Lots of zombies that seemed to be everywhere where the soldier swam? I so doubt that if zombies prefer eat living people and their brains, will prefer swimming and eating fish which they of course can't catch. Too many living people get killed by other living people, or kill the close ones. Since the movie actually starts in ''the diary of the dead'', we see familiar faces. The man that was using power to rob people in ''the diary of the dead'' seemed to care less about leaving 1 333 033 $ to himself. Did he have much time to change? Not really. But he became a very different character in this movie. And if that wasn't enough, when the person gets shot and by the script suppose to survive, they seem to move freely as before they got shot. People that get bitten don't scream in pain even if they lose considerable parts of their bodies. And a cranky old man who kills his own daughter to prove something to other survivors. Yes, she was bitten, but he killed her much much later for nothing. She was although about to say something and since she died on half the sentence, I don't know what it was. Visual effects are okay. Nothing too special, in fact sometimes it seemed like a downgrade. Romero's previous works seemed much better. And I don't mean only the script.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am a preteen who received a kindle fire as a gift and downloaded this app. I enjoy playing it and was surprised how addicting it can get. I recommmend this to anyone who thinks its an adult only game!
B0063IH60K|5.0|i absolutely love this app! i play it all the time! its super easy and fun! I definitely would recommend it.
B005QPMB2Y|1.0|after updating..I simply lost my camera feed. nothing has changed. I log into website I see the feed and launch ip camera nothing. wish I never upgraded. this sucks.
B005D643PO|5.0|What can I say.  If you are this far along in the series you know that Dexter rocks.  It's probably not as strong as previous seasons though. Still, looking forward to the next season.
B004FOA84A|4.0|This game is great looking and plenty of fun to play, but it is entirely too short. If it wasn't for that flaw, I would have awarded this app 5 stars.
B004UQPM4E|5.0|This box is wonderful. The finish is first, not counting the large number of extras on the discs. Essential to any collector of the Man of Steel!
0060873027|5.0|The novel \\"MICRO\\" by Michael Crichton & Richard Preston, is, by far, the best novel I have read this year. As always with Crichton's novels, all subject matter and details are researched to the fullest. If one really wants to know in plain language the current state of technology and big pharma then the fast reading, superbly written \\"MICRO\\" is the book to read. \\"MICRO\\" will almost certainly be a major motion picture.
B005LZW8FO|4.0|This was a very good film that could have been an outstanding film if the ending had been done better.  I won't give away any explicit secrets, so let me talk around it a little.<br /><br />Some stories set you up, and then leave you hanging at the end in such a way that there are multiple, interesting ways you could interpret the ending.  They don't give you a specific ending because it is more fulfilling for the viewer to work out on their own what they think was the most likely meaning, if any.  Usually, there is some very dramatic twist associated with this kind of ending that tries to catch the viewer off guard, forcing them to further contemplate \\"what does it all mean?\\"  That appears to be what the writers of the screen play were shooting for with this one, but in fact what they ended up with for a \\"twist\\" was not at all unexpected.  In fact, given other scenes in the movie, it would have been rather a glaring omission if the \\"twist\\" event of the final scene hadn't taken place.  In that sense, it was really something you expected, and when it happens you're thinking to yourself, \\"Okay, here it comes...\\"  But there's nothing more except the rolling of the credits.  The \\"twist\\" turns out to be just the logical extension of what you already half anticipated would have to happen.  Dramatically speaking, it's a huge let down.<br /><br />I compare this to a film like The Fountain, which I saw for the first time at the theatre.  When the credits began rolling, the entire packed theatre went dead silent.  No one spoke, and no one moved at all until well into the credits.  It was as if we were all stunned by the implications of what had just taken place.  I have never seen such a reaction to a film like that before nor since.  The emotional impact, and the fact that the mind was just left reeling from the implications the film raised literally took the breath away from the audience.  I'd hoped for something equally powerful from Another Earth.  The potential was certainly there, but the script writers just weren't up to the task.  The ending left behind only a sense of having failed to live up to the potential of the film.<br /><br />The film is really an exploration of the idea of making choices, sometimes good, sometimes bad, and then taking responsibility for the consequences.  It's about balancing the cosmic scale where you can, because it's the right thing to do.  And it deals a little bit with the notion of being able to forgive and renew yourself, even though inside you may initially feel like you don't merit such forgiveness.  The concept of there being \\"another Earth\\" is really just a foil; a mirror, for exploring these ideas, and with just a very little bit of rewriting of the script, any number of other foils could have been substituted that would have told the story as it was told just as well.<br /><br />It may sound as though I didn't care for the film, but I did.  It was a very good film, and the message it brings is one that, if understood and put into general practice, would make this world a much better place.  But from a strictly technical viewpoint, there are things, most particularly the ending, that could have been done differently that would have resulted in an ending that slammed home with the impact of an atomic bomb.  As it was, all you really get is a rather meager firecracker.  I'm hopeful that perhaps other endings were shot, but not used, and perhaps at some point in the future they would be included as alternate endings in the special features of the release.  I would really like to see what other possibilities the writers of this screenplay might have come up with.  It certainly wouldn't take much effort to improve on the one they chose.script writers just weren't up to the task.

B0049P1VHS|5.0|The first season is the best so my niece was very excited with this Christmas gift. Buying it through Amazon was great because it got home at time before my trip.
B00338QENI|5.0|I read this from cover to cover in one sitting. I was both fascinated & horrified. Amazed at the woman and sickened at how the medical industry just NEVER stopped raping this family- even her adult children!!! A huge eye opener at what is really going on behind the scenes in the medical research industry. I thought the medical practioner arena was corrupt enough- I didn't realize just how deep it really goes. Frightening beyond words at how there is still not enough  checks & balances preventing these thieves from doing it again.
B002NPUCIA|5.0|Saw Brian open for Barry Manilow a few times and he and his band are incredible.  I was excited to get this recording (haven't watched the film yet--only listened to the CD) and it does not disappoint.  Mainly uptempo cuts, virtually instrumental, and packed with energy in every note.  As the title implies, this is live from the studio so no audience cheering on the audio CD.  Don't skip this one!
B004P7CN5O|5.0|Bought this for my grandson, he loves this movie, too bloody for me.  Quick delivery.  Bought several movies for him on the DVD reduced rates for Christmas.
B005H0IW6W|3.0|I just got the CD for my mom yesterday and after her opening the case which was in a good condition we found a chunk of the CD missing. This disturbed us both,but when we played the CD it seemed to work just fine but I am annoyed of its sloppy condition. Overall I am happy the cd worked, but dissatisfied that I could have been broken for good.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I wasn't at first familiar with the game until I read a review of it in the news.  At first I played it on my desktop through Google rather than through facebook. Frankly, the Facebook site is getting overloaded and games aren't running smoothly there anymore so I don't play the online games on Facebook anymore.  But I did want to continue to play somewhat mindless games...like when waiting in a doctor office where I didn't want to get into a new magazine or book.  At first I played on my phone and more recently added it to my Kindle Fire.  It plays best on the Kindle fire because the screen is the right size for personal use.  I have no trouble at all with the game and love the mindlessness of it.  It's addictive.  The resolution is spectacular.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|This movie will keep your attention as most Eastwood movies do.  It is so sad that the movie portrays what does go on  in our large cities.  I don't like the street language but it is realistic which is sad.  Watch it !
B004U52VPS|2.0|I was so excited to give this to my kids.  They were just as excited to open it.  The very first toss of the bird led to tears.  The bucket launcher broke on the 1st try. Glue nor tape were an option because it broke at the pressure point.  The kids played with it for a couple of days and hand tossed the birds, but soon grew bored.  Nice premise, but cheaply made.  :-(
0962344702|4.0|Book came quickly and was in great condition.  The artwork highlighted in this book is phenomenal (as is with all of his work).  So excited to have this book back in our collection!  This book appeals to art lovers and Sci Fi buffs as well.
B000GUJZ4G|5.0|enjoyed the commentary aswell as the movie patrick swaze was always a class act to watch in his movies wished he was still with us all
B005XRU62C|4.0|This album is very unique...I love it. I play it at the gym or just around the house. It is different than most of my other music which ranges from 80s to Ray LaMontagne to Nirvana, so it usually gets played when I am sick of the same old stuff
B005G4TJI4|2.0|Let's start out with the film. I would say that this Transformers film rivals the first one in quality. It's really that good. I would give it a solid four out of five. This was the first film that I had seen in IMAX 3-D after returning to the states from being stationed overseas. I was completely blown away with the 3-D effects and sound. However, I feel as if I have been duped by Paramount in that when I opened my blu-ray combo pack there was a 5 or 10 dollar off coupon for the Transformers: Dark of the Moon 3-D, Blu-ray/DVD+ Digital Copy! I know that the studio is trying to squeeze every dollar they can out of us, but come on! They probably had the 3-D version ready but wanted to milk us some more. I would not recommend buying this version and waiting on the newer one scheduled to release soon.   So to summarize:  Film- 4  Shady Blu-ray release business practices- 1 (negative if I could)
B002JVWQSW|5.0|This is really one of the best shows on TV right now. It makes a great gift for anyone with a witty sense of humor. I love the jokes that are ongoing throughout the season, sort of reminds me of Arrested Development sometimes.
B001HN6918|5.0|I was a Kung Fu Panda fan straight away after the first film. (I actually purchased the Panda-monium double pack that included a second DVD about each member of the Furious Five.) This time around, I decided to just get the single edition, as the 2nd disc for the first film seemed rather childish. I absolutely loved this film.  The story had a lot more grit, or what can be considered grit for a Family genre film. From Lord Shen's past to the brutal truth of Po's family, the entire thing takes a step up from movie one.  There was also more kung fu, a lot more. The real styles of each warrior were demonstrated in various scenes, this time with more actual delivery instead of being stuck between Jack Black's jokes and catchphrases.  And yes, for anyone wondering, Skadoosh makes a reprise.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|I dressed in black and mourned for a year when HBO cancelled this amazing show! How dare they! How could they!?! apparently it was too expensive to keep this show on air! hello! ever heard of using cheaper fabrics and metals...(ugh!) A.N.Y.W.A.Y. - Whether you watched this show on HBO or not, this DVD series transports you back to the way things were back in Rome. It is edgy, sexy, thought provoking, seducing and each of the actors (in my opinion) gave their hearts and souls into their roles. Ray Stevenson who plays Titus Pullo (swooning) is a Rome god and the reason I had to have this series ...oh, and for the historical aspects and my love of history of course (cough! cough!). If you don't like graphic scenes - think macho war scenes, public executions, heads rolling, adult makeouts and blood, then you can mute and look away but you must ..must.. must get this series. Hopefully the folks at HBO will come to their senses and bring this back on television. Until then, I have the 22 exquisite episodes to keep me going. Worth every penny...

B005YDLJ76|4.0|The only reason I'm giving this a 4 star is because I was distracted by the fact that she was pregnant when she shot this concert DVD! Plus it's Beyonce! she does Arena's, not small intimate venues. I know! I know! I'm horrible and deserve to burn in hell but you will see what I mean when you get it :). Okay, let's focus ... I'm a huge Destiny's Child Fan and Beyonce Fan; have all of their concert DVD's and have seen them in concert in my hometown (Atlanta) so I was really looking forward to this. To be honest, I did not care for the story telling by Beyonce about her Journey leading to '4' only because I have heard it so many times, I could tell it myself. I also must say that I honestly don't see Beyonce as an intimate venue artist. She is more of a huge arena kinda girl so I had to scale down my beyonce mania down a notch. I will say this: Her voice is powerful, and her band is amazing; she does her best to keep up with her dancers and you can tell that unlike other concert DVD's; she is truly humbled and grateful to be performing at Roseland. I loved the fact that she is very honest and open about her life, her relationship with Jay etc. There are also glimpses into her life throughout the concert, which can be a little distracting because I kept pausing to see who she was partying with privately (insert a pregnant Alicia Keys and Kanye West Here ..amongst others). Overall, a must have for every Beyonce Fan or any music fan in general.
B005ZUR724|1.0|I got this game on Christmas eve and got to play all Christmas day but then it shut down for server maintenance and now requires an update that is nowhere to be found. I am really upset that I have spent good money for a game that is the virtual equivalent of a paperweight and that I also got my husband and sister to purchase it as well.  I am uninstalling and maybe if they fix it I might change my review.
B00005AQ65|5.0|If you haven't seen it, but like crusty demons of dirt, you'll like it. Its basically the same thing, but more focused on skis. I would recommend it to anyone who likes extreme sports. I would also recommend the other AMCF movies!
0385732554|5.0|Eleven-year-old Jonas lives in a \\"perfect\\" society: there is no war, no poverty, no hunger, no sickness. Everyone has equality and there is Sameness exists. Everyone is given a job when they turn twelve, and Jonas is quickly approaching this important age. Jonas is selected by the Community to be the very honorable \\"Receiver of Memories,\\" in which he spends time with The Giver and learns all of the memories of things past. The Giver is the only one who knows the truth of what went on before Sameness, and now it is time for Jonas to begin the process of taking those memories from him.<br /><br />I've been wanting to read this book for a really long time. I have no idea why I waited so long! I inhaled it. It is absolutely incredible. Ms. Lowry did an amazing job creating a society that is free of worry, free of pain, free of anything troublesome. Everything is, well, just lovely. At least I thought it was, because Jonas thought it was....<br /><br />...until I realized something HUGE about the way Jonas sees things. I mean, about the way he *literally* sees things with his eyes! Wow! Jonas only realizes that he and the rest of the people in his community are being completely deceived in their perception of things when he spends time with The Giver and receives some memories that are very confusing to him.<br /><br />As Jonas begins to take on the memories of the truth of the past before Sameness, he realizes that along with things like warfare, poverty, pain, hunger, there was also the warmth of sunshine, the beauty of color, the chill of snow, and the delight of rain. He realizes that he has a choice: to let the rest of the community continue to live as they are...without knowing any of the good and the bad of the past and also without the ability to choose anything for themselves, or he can make them aware of all that they are missing. What they don't know can't hurt them, right?<br /><br />Jonas and The Giver make a plan to carry out their decision...and then theirplan A turns to a plan B...and things get a bit crazy and chaotic. My heart was thumping almost out of my chest! Even though Gathering Blue and The Messenger (Lowry's sequel books) are not part of the challenges, I will absolutely read them in the not too distant future...<br /><br />I would love it if everyone I knew read this book right now. It was that good! I will recommend it to everybody. I can't believe it has been in existence for so long and I am just now getting to it. But thank goodness I did! I finished it several days ago and cannot stop thinking about it.

0385534639|5.0|It isn't often that books garner the amount of pre-publication buzz that Erin Morgenstern's THE NIGHT CIRCUS did. I began to hear and read about this book months and months ago and the buzz turned into full-on hype over a rather short time. For me, the excitement began over the stunning cover. I knew I wanted to read the book based on the cover alone and for the folks that know anything about me at all, you know this isn't at all uncommon. Then I read the summary...<br /><br />The story centers around illusionists Celia and Marco, and their challenge, but the Circus is such an entity that it ends up being a setting, a character, and a story itself. The author tells her story using several different narrators, which completely enriches our perspective on everything. She also moves through time, choosing to tell her story in the past, the present, and the future. It may sound confusing by my description, but it actually works very well. Each chapter is clearly marked with the setting in terms of time and place, so the reader always has a sense of where, when, and who -- and the chapters are fairly short in length so that we have an equal representation of all of the varying points-of-view. I have always loved a well-constructed story written in alternating POV, and Morgenstern raises the bar with THE NIGHT CIRCUS. In my opinion, the execution was flawless and the complex structure added to the mystique and charisma of this circus that opens at nightfall and closes at dawn.<br /><br />From the first word on the first page until the last word at the end, this book was nothing but absolute magic for me. It was captivating. It was bold, it was dark, and it was lovely. I knew that it would be the story of a circus and that there would be some magic involved, but I did not know to what degree the magic, the enchantment, and the somewhat-paranormal aspect would be. I was in almost as much wonder at reading this tale as the crowds probably were in witnessing Celia's shows of illusion at the circus. I know, without a doubt, that I read this book with a smile because I was told that I was reading with a smile.<br /><br />I cannot believe how easy it was for me to feel like I was at the circus myself. With the descriptive narrative used by the author, I felt like I could hear the flaps of the tents blowing in the wind, I could smell the cotton candy and caramel in the air, I could taste the hot chocolate that was sold at the concession stands. The language used by the author was never overly heavy or descriptive, but it was certainly thorough. Nothing was left out, from the description of every tent at the circus down to the details of the gowns Celia wore.<br /><br />There is a romance that buds between Celia and Marco -- it becomes stronger and stronger until they are so deeply in love they are almost sick with it. This is never overpowering in the plot. The romance is not bigger than the circus nor the challenge, but it is certainly an integral part of the story. Further, what is incredibly interesting and wonderful and different about the romance in this story is that the author wrote these two deeply in love after barely even having any physical contact at all. The magic is so intense when these two touch -- even just their hands touching -- that the lights flicker and the room shakes.<br /><br />As I read, I became so attached to these characters, I was almost afraid to keep reading because I had no idea what was going to happen. Erin Morgenstern was able to keep the mystery about this story the entire way through, and it kept me turning page after page with my heart literally pounding in my chest. By the time I neared the peak of the story -- the climax -- I was almost out of breath so I put the book down for a minute because I thought I just needed a break before I finished. After a couple of seconds with it sitting on the table, I had to pick it right back up and keep going. Friends, THIS is the sign of a masterpiece, a work of genius.<br /><br />I know that there will be some people that will not particularly care for this book. I won't understand it, but that's okay. This is by far one of the best books I've read this year, and will likely be one of my all-time favorites. I love all of the characters and the setting. I love the dark, beautiful language of the author. I love the alternating points-of-view and time. I love the allure and magic of the circus. I'm so highly impressed by Erin Morgenstern's debut novel and I'm hoping that you will pick it up and give it a chance.<br /><br />If you love magic, chances are you'll love this story. If you love your romance heavy and breathless, but with barely any touching at all -- good gracious, this story is for YOU. If you love science-fiction and fantasy, you'll more-than-likely love The Night Circus. These thoughts came nowhere close to doing this book any type of justice at all. I so desperately want to re-read this book, it is like a pain in my chest. THAT's how much I loved it. So if you're one of the ones who trust my bookish opinions, go get it. Just do it.<br /><br />Erin Morgenstern, THANK YOU for making my bookish year. I waited SO LONG for this book, and it absolutely delivered and more. It is beautiful and I love it so, so much.nius.<br /><br />I know that there will be some people that will not particularly care for this book. I won't understand it, but that's okay.

B002DMJLTE|5.0|After recently re-watching Deep Impact, I've come to the conclusion that it is a very overlooked filmed in terms of disaster movies.  Given that it came out within twelve months of Michael Bay's [[ASIN:B0036EH3TS Armageddon [Blu-ray]]], audiences chose to spend their dollars on Bay's bigger budget and fancier special effects.  There has been a disturbing trend in disaster movies over the last decade, with each spending less time focusing on plot and realism and more on outdoing anything that has come before it.  For proof of this, look no further than [[ASIN:B0032KNA4I 2012 (Single Disc Version)  [Blu-ray]]] or [[ASIN:B000VDDWE2 The Day After Tomorrow [Blu-ray]]].  Explosions and incredible scenes of destruction are to be expected with a film of this genre, but Deep Impact shows that it's still possible to include this without venturing too far out of the realm of possible and going simply for shock factor.<br /><br />The film revolves around a teenage Leo Biederman (Elijah Wood) who discovers an anomaly in the night sky which ultimately turns out to be a seven mile wide comet. Biederman's discovery, which would be exciting enough to any amateur astronomer, becomes even more relevant when it is discovered that his comet is on a collision course with Earth.  At this size, an impact anywhere on the planet would be enough to mirror the K-T Extinction and possibly cause the end of most life on the planet. The story focuses on the President's response to the comet, reporter Jenny Lerner's (T&eacute;a Leoni) scoop of the story and professional rise, the NASA team tasked with attempting to deflect its path, and Leo's relationship with his girlfriend (LeeLee Sobieski). While none of these stories really stand out and are all very weakly delivered (especially the relationship between Jenny and her father), they all play second billing to the real star - the Wolf-Biederman comet.  The best thing about Deep Impact is the developing suspense of the comet's impact and attempts to stop it.  With only some minor exceptions, I had very little difficulty believing everything in Deep Impact. No suspension of disbelief required (in stark contract to Armageddon).  There are a few cringe-worthy moments, such as a couple waiting patiently for a tsunami to overtake them, as well as much of Leoni's acting, however for the most part, Deep Impact is a very plausible look at what an extinction-level scenario could be.  The image of the comets in space and entering earth's atmosphere are amazing and even more so when these 14-year old effects are viewed against much of the images being put out in Hollywood today.<br /><br />Although I do think the film could have been improved with some slight casting changes, eliminating the \\"I hate my father\\" story, and a more hardened look at what humans would do in the actuality of such a situation (ala more looting, violence, and self-preservation), I still think Deep Impact holds up over a decade later as one of the best disaster movies in the genre and a great popcorn flick.<br /><br />ABOUT THE BLU-RAY RELEASE:<br /><br />The blu-ray release has a decent 2.39:1 aspect ratio with acceptable video quality, although the colors don't \\"pop\\" as much as I would like and it could use a little more cleaning up.  But overall, perfectly acceptable for a movie of this age and I was impressed with the clarity.  The audio does a much better job, with a Dolby TrueHD audio codec that sounds great on my 5.1 system.  The audio is well-adjusted and I never had to race for the volume button on my remote.  It only contains a few featurettes which weren't very exciting and didn't add much to the release. I really would have liked to have seen some interviews with astrophysicists about the likelihood of an actual extinction level event or comet hitting Earth, as this is what everyone is going to be wondering after seeing this film.  While the Blu_Ray release is fairly decent, it definitely could have used a 4 minute interview with NeilDeGrasse Tyson.
B00479SVBU|5.0|Have used this for several days now in two different cars and it works great.  No interference.  I'm not picky about a lot of things like some people.  i just want to play my music, no commercials and listening to songs I do not like.  Haven't used the flash drive but the sd card works perfect.  I love this little gadget!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|When I was searching for a cover for my new Kindle fire, I was mostly looking for a lightweight case that would not weigh down the reader (its already a bit heavy), would be almost unnoticeable when reading on it, and had a stand.  Despite some of the reviews on this cover I decided to give it a try and must say - I love it!  It is super light but sturdy enough to make me feel it will be protected in my pocketbook.  When you open and attach the front cover to the back, it almost looks as if there is no cover on at all (which is one of the major issues I had with my older Kindle cover, and I usually took the Kindle out to read from it).  Finally, I am not sure what issues others are having with the stand, but mine worked perfectly well on a table and countertop surface.  All in all, very pleased with my purchase!
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is awesome and its super cute too. I usually never write reviews but I had to on this game. Best game on the market! Very entertaining.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|this game is fun to play because you all it of people play this game my litle brother play this game everyday also my mom too.
B0058VW36U|5.0|this game is incredible and even though I did not get the app yet I have played it before and it is my second. favorite game
B005ZUR724|5.0|this game is amazing and i love it great graphics its like wow for mobile .. how do i get updates on kindle fire
B005K17RU0|4.0|use it often, easy to use, User friendly, best of the rest. use daily and quite often. loads fast. great
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy many hours playing this. It is perfect for unwinding after a stressful day. Can't wait to add more apps like this one.
B005IEWUQA|5.0|This two minute prequel provides good back story before Let's Kill Hitler, which in my humble opinion is the most touching Doctor Who episode ever.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|Wow, that's basically all I could say when I got this case. Let me tell you off the bat that the case is smaller in person than on the pictures. Its so perfectly fitted to the kindle fire that it didn't seem like the unit weight ever changed with it on. In fact the balance of the unit seemed to get even better with this case while holding it. I had the casecrown case for it originally but it felt uncomfortable after holding the unit for a while due to the edge clamps at the bottom corner of the case that stuck out. Then plus it added more weight to the unit. This case however feels the exact opposite.  Its like having a redesigned model for the kindle fire. I also love how soft it feels in the hand. The material they used for the skin layer is so soft it feels like a thin pillow. I have no earthly idea why someone would give this product a 2 or 3 other than pure hatred of the product for bias reasons. I wouldn't go with any other product at this time that would do the kindle fire more justice than this case. I can see why originally they were packaging them together as a option to buy. Treat yourself and your kindle to this. You want regret it.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Very intriguing and interesting! Loved it! Catches you from the beginning! Would highly recommend to friends! Loved the characters and pictures.  Fascinating!  May have to read again!
B006NXIO0Q|5.0|Who I just loved her and the Movie was fantastic all the action a guy could want and more and what she pulled off was fantastic and what a body she has and as an actor she is one of the leading woman I would vote for a 6 Star for her as an actor I hope to see her in her next movie for sure.
0316017930|4.0|Solid read, and a great premise.  Gladwell has some intriguing claims in this book but I found it to wander off the path at times.  Still completely worth your time.
034552554X|4.0|The plot is well written with interesting characters and events.  The mystery lingered between the lines of facts and insinuation.  I did not regret spending time reading this book.  I'll be coming back to check other readers' reviews.
0393338398|5.0|The classic story of being a contrarian and doing things differently than \\"the way it is\\" to make things happen.  A lot of this is outdated nowadays as other teams have adopted the Oakland A's metrics (making me question why Billy Beane allowed Lewis to write this at the time).  That said, the writing is classic Lewis, focused on putting you right there and inside the mind of the characters.  I really enjoyed the sections about Bill James and Chad Bradford.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I bought this for my Kindle fire and love it! I only had to pay .99 for it. I'm addicted to uno.
0393338827|5.0|Probably a required read for anyone that wants to learn more about the financial crisis.  Lewis leverages his time in the financial sector to paint a very intriguing portrait of the characters involved in it all.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I totally Love this game, its the classic version, so no surprises. its just like from the computer. thank you
0743201140|5.0|I have found the exercise of identifying and leveraging your strengths to be quite helpful in my business career.  I'd recommend it to anyone who is interested at taking a hard look at themselves and identifying what are the areas they need to be focusing on leveraging.  It's not the end all be all management or development tool, but is definitely a great tool that should round out a development plan.
B003VANOFY|1.0|I bought this for my son for Christmas.  The minute he opened it and tried it it didn't work right.  There are problems with the right side going out.  I plan on returning it.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|It is fun, sometimes hard to click on the items. It has an interesting plot. I would recommend to friends.
B0063IH60K|4.0|A great game to play when you are bored! It's a little frustrating because it's hard to win. But I keep playing!
B004SIP6C2|5.0|I can't help loving this emotionally touching coming-of-age film. And Charlize Theron has to be the most glamorous thing to ever stuff rotted bait into a lobster trap. I'd chop chum with her any day.<br /><br />But I understand the objections of the one-star detractors. This movie does make a whole lot of wrong things seem right, such as:<br /><br />1) Sniffing ether for recreational kicks<br />2) Casual abortions concluding in an unceremonious fetus toss into the incinerator<br />3) Fornicating with your buddy's girlfriend while he's off at war<br />4) Exemption from military service via fraudulent medical records<br />5) Practicing medicine without a license, leading to<br />6) Impersonating a doctor using forged credentials<br /><br />The film finally draws a moral line by condemning Mr Rose's incest with his daughter. So we can be glad for that, at least.
B00632HWOG|5.0|to access all of your e-mails with a kindle fire you just turn it to landscape position and it works fine. not to worried about password protection as I have the device password protected. I have not found it buggy in the five days I have been using It.   Overall it manages my three yahoo e-mail accounts very effectively.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|I bought this and after multiple tries am unable to download to android tablet. Customer service is non-existent in terms of returns or help!!!!Totally annoyed!
B001GF8WPI|5.0|For the product itself, it came very quickly from Amazon and was exactly as described.  For the movie, I would have to say IMHO it is the best thing Will Ferrell has done.  It's funny at times, serious at others and really makes you think about how you impact another's life.  Elements in the movie that I think were unnecessary: nude men in the shower, full back views (do they really think we want to see that?? <Shiver> ) a couple crude references that Dustin Hoffman makes.  They really didn't bring anything to the movie so why keep them in?
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|I was not expecting greatness from this movie. I fell in love with Mila Kunis because her character was just so darn cute. The chemestry between the two are obvious and very well played out.
0307272702|2.0|I am having a difficult time with this book.  Although I know people who lost weight on no carbs diets, those diets just do not seem healthy.<br /><br />There are some interesting points in the book that seem to be supported by scientific evidence, however, although I need to and want to loose some weight, I do not feel comfortable following recommendations in the book.<br /><br />I believe that recommendations in Eat to Live ([[ASIN:031612091X Eat to Live: The Amazing Nutrient-Rich Program for Fast and Sustained Weight Loss, Revised Edition]]) sound healthier, but not easy to follow too because they are very different from my curent habits.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Accurate, informative, good design, battery-friendly. Has all the details the average weather watcher needs, presented in an easy to read interface. Not as detailed as my other favorite, Weather Bug Elite, but this app is easier on the eyes.
B004LWZW7Y|4.0|A funny story of stealing ones' possessions to become rich while deceiving and cheating on each other, presenting victims as creatures not worthy to live, and sharing some fraction of wealth obtained illegally with commoners making de-facto them co-participating in a crime such legalised somehow by, sounds and looks as a very English folk story.<br /><br />If not approaching from the very roots of deeds pictured, it is a funny family movie with great computing effects impressive in the modern cinema theatre a film was watched at.
1594744769|5.0|I really liked this book and it is a refreshing change from the same ole, same ole, that has been printed lately.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I love books. I love the look, the smell, the feel. For someone like me who is not entirely comfortable with giving up books 100%, this is a good baby step. The cover makes it look and feel more like an old fashioned book. The kindle fits in snug and the front cover folds back for one handed reading. I love it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I'm absolutely hooked.  this game is a blast and I highly recommend it. challenging, fun, and a new favorite of mine.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book is overall very good and one of the books that everyone shoud read. It has a strong motivation behind the story and keeps the reader turning the page to see who dies next.
1439175640|5.0|This book explains the best way to prepare and bake several wonderful cookies, quick breads, and cakes of all sorts. They also include frosting recipes as well. I bought this book to prepare myself to bake up cupcakes for a friends wedding and love that most of the recipes make several dozens of cupcakes or cookies. Just what I needed!
B005DZMNHA|5.0|As is his usual..............if your a fan of Chris Rea , then what's not to like ? Another strong album from a great , white ,  European blues guy ( go figure ) .
0805028846|5.0|I bought this book for a 10 year old and he loved it! He's a big paper crafter and couldn't wait to start cutting up paper and try out some of the designs.
B0063GORYU|5.0|spend too much time playing. lol. I love it. my husband laughs when I start playing because he knows I will play for a long time.
B005R32L66|5.0|its skype. Love the app. Choppy with the video calls if you dont have a 4g or wifi connetion but thats to be expected. not offered in the android market place on all phones, glad i got it from here in the amazon app store.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Excellent graphics, medium level puzzles.  Good for an hour or two worth of play.  Wished it was longer.  Would recommend to a friend.
0385534639|1.0|I have never read a book that I literally hated, until now.  I enjoyed nothing about the Night Circus.  At the 100 page mark, I nearly quit reading it, but carried on as I stupidly believed that it might have some redeeming value. It didn't.  The Night Circus has nothing going for it.  The plot (?) is weak, boring and undeveloped.  The characters are weak, boring and undeveloped.  The writing itself was difficult to endure.  Even though the entire book is based on magic, there is nothing enchanting, whimsical, or charming in this book. The \\"love\\" story part of the book was completely without feeling or emotion.  The Night Circus left a glum feeling in my spirit, and I genuinely wish that I had not read it.  Not only did I waste a good deal of time, I actually felt worse for having read it. Rather ironic that the black and white theme of the circus so aptly describes the colorlessness of this book. I work at a public library, and several of my patrons have returned this book unread. They said that they tried, but could not get into it and quit reading it.  I only wish that I had done the same.  Please don\\"t waste your time.  After all that hype, I was not just disappointed, I felt somehow disturbed.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|like in the end me and my opponent were one to one and it.wouldn't let us kill each other we had to be one apart
B0063IH60K|5.0|this sure was a quick app to load and great to pass the time and great for the kindle fire
B0063GORYU|5.0|Really enjoy this game. great on my new kindle. I like the feature that allows you to choose how many suits to play with
B003HE2B6C|5.0|This CD is prue fun!! I love the horns that are on most tracks and there is really not a bad song on this CD. It's not as good as Underneath but I think it is better then the Walk.<br /> The stand out tracks to me are Thinkin' bout somethin', Kiss me when you come home, Give a little, And I waited (my favrotie track) and Me myself and I. If your a Hanson fan you HAVE to buy this CD!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|The games are lots of fun and a good selection.  I like playing and trying to unlock more new games.
B0036T32LQ|4.0|The problem is that there is no subtitles on any prime instant movie at all. It is so sad that Amazon.com company doesn't support and providing everything for its coumsters. This need to be changed. It is not on only this movie, but also all of others too.
0439023491|5.0|Love this book...love this series!  Can't wait to finish and see the movies.  If your looking for something fresh and very interesting, give it a try.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Perfect tool to remember everything. Snap a photo or clip and annotate information from websites. Organize with tags and search your phone rather than wrack your brain while shopping. Synchs computer with mobile devices.  Could not live without!
B000SEGUDE|5.0|It's shaped like a pyramid. Well, more like a ziggurat. And what this man does with the prose style, changing the diction like that. Wow. Just read it.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I really like this cover. I bought it despite all the bad reviews but I don't find it to be cheap at all. Very light, but not cheap.. the fit and finish is excellent and once the cover flap loosens up a little it covers the front perfectly.  I just wanted something to keep my Fire from getting scratched up and this works for me. The stand feature works fine on a table or desk. I don't think I'd want to drop my Fire in this, but that goes for any case. Since they don't make an otter case for it then this is it for me.
B004H4XLR4|2.0|Cool design and fairly durable... but this, like another Car II item we purchased, has a door that will not latch.  It is clear that the door should latch because there is a mechanism to push it open.  Even my three year old could tell that it was build wrong.    Two things disappoint me:  1) The toy is nice and my son likes it.  I just wish he would stop asking me to fix it because the design doesn't allow for a fix.    2) We purchased a train from the Car II collection and it's doors wont latch either.
B004LZRSBY|5.0|This was an amazing blu-ray.  It will always be one of my favorite bands.  I can't believe I still have a part that really like this band.  The concert covered most of the songs we loved if you are an a-ha fan.  It includes documentary that is touching and a photo gallery.    The quality of the cinematography was excellent throughout.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I love this game and have had it on multiple phones but it seems to freeze up on the galaxy nexus for some reason I will be happy to give it a 5 star rating again once it is fixed
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitare is a classic game, one of my favorite time filler. Works great on my kindle fire!  No issues with the program.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|All seven of these sharpeners arrived very soon after I ordered them.  I purchased bead chains for them and put them in Christmas stockings.  Every one of the recipients was delighted with them.  Thank you!
B000023VR8|5.0|Very fast service the product came earlier then I expected and it was in mint condition just like I was told it would be! I definately recommend their service!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|easy to use. offers for free what other apps charge for. the devotionals and daily readings I think surpass anything else offered, for pay or free.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I luv Angry Birds it is so cool and addicting. my favorite season is Summer... because it reminds me of a good time!
B004LROUW2|2.0|The title says it all. The narrative has sparks of excitement, but the tediousness with which the author retells the same concepts in a convoluted way over and over make for a very disconjointed story. It is ultimately just a bear to read.
B005ZUR724|1.0|This app was awesome and amazing for an entire day before the app crashed and it told me I needed to update it even though there is no update hence my 1 star review
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I just started today so I haven't unlocked any games beyond the 10 but I think the games are pretty fun. short but fun :) I'm hoping the more games I unlock, the better the games will get.
B0058VW36U|4.0|well its really awesome, fun, and entertaining, but where is the update!? very cute but crude graphics, I am finding I like that. GO FRUIT NINJA!!!!!!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I was given the Kindle fire as a gift.  I love its size (that fits into a big pocket) but I need a case to protect it during traveling.  This shell works great!  The Kindle fits in very tightly so there is no additional bulk and it gives me the option of standing it up on a 45 degree angle which is more useful than I thought for reading at a table.  Very satisfied with this purchase!!  Amazon value much better than Staples for the same product.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great game! I love to sit and play this game. I could play it all day! its the best.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|All movies are there. Great price. No complaints. Recommend it to anyone who is interested! I wish I could give it a million stars really!
B000V5Y2DK|4.0|I saw Star Trek: Deep Space Nine every week, when they came out, commercials and all.  This is one of those episodes that sticks out in my mind.  It's very clever, very sci-fi, alien, and you have no idea what's going on till the end.  The only complaint is that they didn't save this episode for later in the series.  I would have loved to see Worf sing \\"Alamarain, count to four, Alamarain, then three more.\\"  It also has nothing to do with the overall story arc.  4.0/5 stars.  ~Keep On Trekkin
B0063IH60K|4.0|great passtime. would be better if it had different levels. also it would be nice to let it tell you when u have loss the game. (
B000V5Y2QM|4.0|I liked this episode.  Thumbs up and all that.  Probably because I like Star Trek.  It's a solid Science Fiction story with lots of depth (and some explosions).  A mystery worthy of the name \\"Star Trek.\\"  Cons: Doesn't do much for the series storyline, and a couple scenes of bad acting.  But sometimes the cheese works, and in this episode, it does.  If you like Star Trek, you'll probably like this episode.  3.9/5 Stars.  ~Keep On Trekkin

0446547654|3.0|I did not read the reviews before reading this book. I got this book as a Christmas gift and being a Nicholas Sparks Lover I was excited about reading it! I opened it up and started reading... I thought, oh wow, I am reading the notebook. As I read further I thought wow this book is for sure not his best. As I got to the end of it I of course as I do in all his books, had a few tears. But, it was still not one of my favorite books he has done.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun mini games that are easy to play with some games being a bit more challenging. provides lots of fun and is very addicting. no issues with game.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the most awesome app yet. Thank you so much.I was found by a young lady who needed help with math.
B001UJUGZY|3.0|Tough one to find in my area so Amazon is always great for finding those hard to find releases and always helps you to keep up.  Decent little thriller with an interesting enough story line that it keeps you watching and definitely well made and acted.  Worth adding to your collection in my opinion...
B0063IH60K|4.0|It's fun and makes a nice sound when moving cards. Only thing is it seems to ignore the &quot;disable aurorotate&quot; feature of my Resound. Also the popup toolbar is clipped on the bottom. But these things only stick out because it is such a polished game.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app by far is very accurate to my area than any other. I trust them and I like their format...very simple to understand. :-)
B004EPZ08Y|5.0|I was among those who saw Final Destination 5 in it's theatrical run, where it was shown in 3D. It was fantastic in 3D, don't get me wrong, but I receive my own copy of the film today and watched it without the 3D. Needless to say, this movie is GREAT, even without the 3D technology that will probably fail in the next few years. Without the 3D, this movie is still just as magical as in the cinema, with the 3D. Don't sell this movie too short just because part of the marketing of it was the 3D, because outside of that, Final Destination 5 brings new fun to the table in another installment of one of the best franchises in the field of horror. Buy this ASAP.
B000002VSN|5.0|This movie was a very good movie with Whitney Houston & Denzel Washington. I support everything that she does and the soundtrack was very good and a must have!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|a fun game and easy to play - kind of obsessive actually ;-) i like that you can customise the cards and table.
B003Y5H5FG|5.0|I watched this movie expecting that it might be an okay vampire movie, but to my surprise it was actually a lot better than I expected!  I had seen the original Fright Night once upon a time...I don't remember a whole lot about it, but I believe it was pretty good for it's time.  I couldn't tell you the contrasts between it and the new Fright Night, other than the modernization, but I do recommend still checking out both of them.  I will probably go back and watch the original again.  In any case, if you like good horror...with a little comedic stuff mixed in as well...especially if you like a good vampire movie, then I highly recommend checking this movie out.  The cast was great and the movie was well made...and I really liked the end of it as well.  I may even buy this movie...I don't think I've bought a horror movie in quite a while, but then again I haven't seen one in a while that I liked as much as this one.  Check it out folks!
B0063IH60K|5.0|i play on my kindle fire.  lots of fun to play. I really enjoy it a lot. and it's free!
B002RL7W9W|4.0|My wife gave me this little set in my stocking for Christmas, and it's pretty neat.  I would have to watch The Empire Strikes Back again and take a closer look, but I don't believe there were any snow speeders like the one in this set on Hoth.  It's still pretty neat though.  I have always loved Legos...use to build them and play with them all the time.  Now, all grown up, I'm still a big kid at heart and a major geek at that, and I like buying the novelty sets like Star Wars, Batman, Pirates of the Carribean, Indiana Jones, etc.  I build them and then adorn various book shelves and table tops & what not with them.  I have to keep them up high anymore though, because otherwise our cats tend to get to them, but it's all good.  Anyway, if you're into collecting the Star Wars Legos or have kids into them, this is a fun little set.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This is the sleekest case design I've come across on the web. The case looks handsome, and is very thin but feels hard and durable. The stand stays in place on a flat surface. I'll see how it holds up on the plane...  Also purchased the Mivizu Amazon Kindle Fire neoprene sleeve case cover with front zipper accessories pocket ($8) on Amazon so that I would have a sleeve to protect the Kindle from the elements when I'm biking. The Kindle, even with the Marware Case on it, fits snug inside the sleeve. Good combo.
B005OK721G|4.0|I was recently in the mood to watch a good action thriller, and this movie came to my attention on Netflix, so I added it to my cue and gave it a watch after it showed up.  I expected it would be fairly good, but it was actually better than I expected.  Maybe not as good as some...I did feel it could have used a slight bit more action, but all in all it was very good, and the action that was in it was pretty good.  If you're into action thrillers, I recommend giving this one a go.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|A Harry Potter Movie: What else is there to say? It's an amazing movie... enough said. You won't regret buying this.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|There are one or two of these films that might have maybe been a little bit more of a 4 star rating in my book, but the whole set itself simply deserves a full 5 star rating!  These movies are enjoyable and a good bet for any fantasy lover out there!  I have never honestly read the books before, so I cannot give a comparison between them and the movies, but no doubt there is more within the books...even Peter Jackson couldn't bring everything over into the Lord of the Rings movies, as epic as they were, but that in no way means that they weren't good movies.  Lord of the Rings was totally amazing!  These movies as well, though not quite as epic as Lord of the Rings, are pretty awesome themselves...and I've been told that the book to movie comparison between these isn't all too bad...not like some I can think of, such as Percy Jackson.  That movie in and of itself was fairly enjoyable, but I happen to have read the books, and Fox totally screwed up that movie!  Anyway, not to get too far off track...Harry Potter, as so many people know, are fun, enjoyable movies and I highly recommend that anyone who enjoys movies checks them out...especially if you're a fantasy lover.  If you're really more of a reader...then read the books!  :-)
B001UV4XIS|5.0|A Harry Potter Movie: What else is there to say? It's an amazing movie... enough said. You won't regret buying this at all.
B000FCKPHG|2.0|The basic concept is set in 20 pages.  The remainder of the book is applying them ,in detail, to a variety of situations.  This could be interesting, but the application in each case is exactly the same.  Once you understand the concept, you can make the same application yourself.  The small amount of research cited is quite interesting, but the rest of the book is tedious and repetitive.  This would be a great book to borrow from the library as opposed to buying.
1440503257|5.0|This cookbook is pretty amazing... amazing recipes, amazing Harry Potter quotes, and some pretty cool history on the origins of the food. There is pretty much everything in this book. I'm going to have a lot of fun with it. I wish there were pictures of the food, but oh well. I still love it.
B004EPZ07U|1.0|There is NO digital DVD included.  One must go through a cumbersome process of downloading the movie.  This procedure was very time-consuming to go through. The authorization process is a hassle. Wait until the movie includes a physical copy of the digital version.  The case for this DVD is environmentally damaging.  The DVD case is full of holes, is lightweight and flimsy. This of course, requires the case to be replaced with a more substantial one (with no holes) and the original case goes into a landfill.   Light can also pass through the DVD case, which may shortening the life of the DVD.   If a sturdier case with no holes were used this senseless waste could be avoided.   I liked the movie.
