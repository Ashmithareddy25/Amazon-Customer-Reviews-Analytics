B004VQRCF0|5.0|This is an excellent show, the band is all smiles and having a great time for the finale of the Union tour back in August of 1991 shot in the Bay Area of California. I had the pleasure of seeing this show &quot;LIVE&quot; in Miami a month earlier in July where Yes performed in the round on a revolving stage. This was YES to the MAX, with 2 drummers(White and Bruford), 2 keyboardists (Wakeman and Kaye), 2 guitarists (Howe and Rabin) with founders Chris Squire on Bass and Jon Anderson on Vocals.<br /><br />The setlist is very good considering this is not a complete show. There was a Special Edition double DVD/CD edition available from Gonzo Multi Media. Much to my chagrin, it was only being offered through the Gonzo Website. The makers of this DVD have cut JA's solo 'Soon',as well as the songs 'Shock to the System' and 'Lift me up' and others from the final edit probably due to time constraints. This is<br />really the only disappointing thing I can say about this DVD. You still get almost 2 hours in (1:58 to be exact)length and the show still comes off as a full show. To bad, I miss the content which was cut. Problem solved! I took the initative to visit the Gonzo Multi media Website and decided to purchase the Deluxe 2 CD and 2 DVD Package from Gonzo for $39.95. The 2nd DVD in the Gonzo Deluxe package has two full length 'bootleg' shows with all the tracks and more which didn't make the final cut of the 1st DVD. The quality of the 'bootleg'shows in the 2nd<br />DVD is so so with inconsistent audio and video which is barely acceptable. Nevertheless, you still get two full length concerts. The Denver and Pensacola concerts are in the round, with all the songs which were excluded in the first DVD. The Denver show is very professionally filmed but has drawbacks with clarity of the video and low hum in the audio background which is kind of annoying after watching for a while. Still, it is rare footage! The 2nd DVD concerts include the Bruford /White drum duet which is awesome. I'm glad I have this limited edition, very rare collection which is out of print now. I won't be selling mine on eBay anytime soon.<br /><br />There are many great individual solo performances which make this a wonderful show. Squire, Howe, Rabin and Wakeman in particular all put on stellar performances. This is a great DVD if you want to look back 20 years from now. The sound and video quality are excellent considering this has been copied from a previous Japenese import version.<br /><br />Sad to say with the recent passing of Chris Squire there will never be a Yes re-union. I will always be thankful I was able to see Chris Squire<br />so many times over the last 45 years.esome. I'm glad I have this limited edition, very rare collection which is out of print now.

0307454541|1.0|How can you follow a book with 79 characters?  I stopped reading after 200 pages.  If you must read it, before you start, get a list of characters from http:[...] .  Good luck ????
0553801473|2.0|**SPOILERS**<br /><br />This series has left feeling like the slow chubby kid in grade school surrounded by bigger kids throwing his property from person to person in a sad sad game of keep-away. The chubby kid is the reader, the property is the plot, character development, and other aspects that make a solid novel worthwhile. The bullies are expectation, too many unresolved cliffhangers, and introductions of non-relevant characters.<br /><br />From the series onset I was surprised and well pleased with the author's willingness to kill off certain characters, it gave the plot a feeling of risk in being emotionally involved with the characters. However by the third and fourth novels, this has been a bit overplayed. And by the fifth novel the killing of Jon Snow cut me off from the Wall and the plot that held the most interest for me, ie undead doom.<br /><br />There is a large part of this novel that is over descriptive. Since the majority of if takes place in an unfamiliar part of Martin's world, we are left floundering with where the hell we are. I was forced to look back repeatedly just to get an idea of where I was supposed to be in this world. This compounded with the introduction and frequent changing of new POV characters I had little idea what the fudge was happening. Which is of interest as very little happened that was relevant to the story with regards to prophecy fulfillment, tangent story completion, and cliffhanger resolution. And now we are short one more character...sad sad sad.<br /><br />What may have made this novel better. Cut out the Quentyn Martell Storyline, it had no bearing on the overall story progression for the novel or the series as a whole. Cut our the Young Griff Storyline, it was haymaker of a plot development. If there had been some foreshadowing in the previous novels we might have been wondering what some secret plot had been in the works from the beginning, but, meh. I do not have to immerse myself in Meereen cuisine for the overall enjoyment of this book. I literally have a sore throat from trying to pronounce the characters in the Dany storyline. The only reason I might read the next book is to figure out how the hell Martin is going to resurrect this series. He doesn't have many original POV characters left, at least that we care about.l enjoyment of this book. I literally have a sore throat from trying to pronounce the characters in the Dany storyline.

B004PGO25O|4.0|The book is very short, to the point, and doesn't dilly dally.  This book is about doing work, your real work, which is not to be confused with your \\"job\\" (though they can be one and the same).<br /><br />The book talks about taking an idea (in this case a book is used as an example) from conception to publishing (aka launching/shipping).  And spends a great deal of time talking about \\"The Resistance\\" which will work to stop us from shipping.<br /><br />If you're interested in moving beyond your day job, this is a good place to start, it's motivational enough that it gets you fired up, but also gives you a basic guide. This won't tell you what to do step-by-step but it will give you the grand strokes that should get you moving in the right direction.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|Believe it or not, this is one of the best, must have, Android apps out there.  I bought it long ago for my OG Droid 1 and am still using it on my Droid 2 Global today.  Not too sound too much like a glowing fanboy review, but it really does redefine how you manage, find, and run your apps especially if you are a power user with over 400 apps installed like me.  I am a bit of an organization junky and have all of my apps organized into a dozen or so folders such as Internet, Multimedia, Tools, Car, Games, etc.  I keep 5 Folder Organizer widgets on my desktop using the Simple theme and the 5 column layout (my 4 most used categories and one for Main menu) and no actual icons at all.  Without it, I would forever be scrolling through my app dock looking for what I want.  I know Android 2.3 has added some new categorizing improvements itself, but they are still not as useful as this app if you truly take the time to categorize all of your apps and learn to take advantage of its full potential.

B005DC68NI|5.0|This review is based on an ARC (digital -- of course).      David Gaughran is an author and a knowledgeable voice in the writing community.  His blog is often cited as one of the best places to get calm, unbiased information about the changing tide of publishing.    Gaughran has taken his best information on how and why to publish independently and put it all in one easy to read book.  Many of his blog entries have been expanded upon, and there are several new and up to date pieces of information that shouldn't be missed.      If you are a writer and have a curiosity about what all this 'indie' stuff is all about; or if you have tired of the query-go-round and want to get off, this book should be your first stop.      One of the best parts of the book are all the voices of successful independent writers who are now making a living from their writing and having their stories read by readers -- not slush pile movers.    Go ahead read it!
B002ZG99N6|2.0|Entertaining enough for those who don't think too much.  There, I said it - I'm sure I'll get the usual insulting posts.    There is very little originality in the plot; the direction, though,  was quite tight (mostly) but the action sequences were simply  action sequences which did little to elevate this film into   anything more than an action film. Afleck was not believable  unfortunately, and neither was the story line or, for that matter,  the action sequences.  Why would anyone choose a career as a security guard in that place?

B004HD2ZHC|4.0|I now own 5 Trail of Dead records and have seen them live twice.  In both instances, I was annoyed they didn't play more songs from the records I love the most - the epic noisy math rock of Worlds Apart and after, rather than the slash and burn of Source Codes & Tags - and then wound up being blown away by the quality of the record they were touring for.  This time around, the band opened with \\"Tao of the Dead Part 2,\\" a 16-minute epic that could contain 5 songs, if you're capable of telling where one part ends and the next begins.  The song is beyond incredible, but coming at the end of Tao of the Dead, it truly sounds like the beginning of what the band wanted to use their epic crescendos and concepts for.  Tao of The Dead opens up with \\"Pure Radio Cosplay,\\" a ferociously drummed, loud song proclaiming the death of the \\"radio song\\" that is exactly the opposite of its subject matter; instead, the song is tonic and unforgettable, a rock masterpiece.  The second half of the record - appropriately picking up on the reprise of \\"Pure Radio Cosplay\\" - is the best work the band has done since Worlds Apart (my favorite record of theirs), climaxing with the beautiful, rocking \\"Ebb Away\\" and flowing neatly into the giant ocean that is \\"Tao... Part 2.\\"  Unfortunately the songs between the two \\"Pure Radio Cosplay\\"s are more like the early ...Trail of Dead records with forgettable beefy licks flowing into each other.  This sort of thing is better than virtually all other hard rock in existence currently, mind you, but it's less of what I love them for.  Happily, the record gives you ample reason to ignore any disappointment this creates.
0553801473|2.0|The experts have spoken and they say that all of you 1, 2 and 3-star Amazon-reviewers of A Dance With Dragons are wrong! You people know who you are.  The ones who have said things like: the plot doesn't move, nothing happens, the cliff hangers are frustrating, and \\"I waited six years for this???\\".  And to that reviewer with the list of plot-lines he wanted to see ticked off, does he think the journey through A Song of Ice and Fire is a shopping trip at Wal*Mart?  Well, professional critics who have degrees in literature and who really understand great writing love DWD.  I'm talking about critics from the NY Times, Publishers Weekly, Time Magazine and The Washington Post. They are giddy over DWD and recognize that the book is  -  Epic, Expansive, Sweeping, Complex, and Laying the groundwork for even greater things to come.  They recognize that through A Song of Ice and Fire, George RR Martin has elevated a work of fantasy to the level of great literature.  If you don't have the intellect and insight to appreciate it, go back to reading Conan the Barbarian stories.<br /><br />Sarcasm aside, I am absolutely baffled by the glowing reviews that DWD has received from many Amazon reviewers and from virtually all professional critics.  I imagine that these critics and reviewers are the same ones who loved books 6 through 12 of Robert Jordan's WOT, and who were left breathless by the second installment of Patrick Rothfuss' King-Killer Chronicles - The Wise Man's Fear.  The sad truth is that many authors who start out strong and who have plenty of passion in their pens and imaginations can very quickly get lazy, sloppy and self indulgent with their writing and story lines.  They begin to write books that have page after page of irrelevant and uninteresting informantion that many readers skim or skip. In the end they allow their work to commit the cardinal sin of any book - IT BECOMES BORING.  It happened with Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time, it happened with Patrick Rothfuss'King-Killer Chronicles, and it has happened with A Song of Ice and Fire.<br /><br />The shortcomings and weaknesses of both Dance With Dragons and A Feast for Crows are glairing.  They should not be explained away, ignored or dismissed by reviewers and professional critics who seem to have become George RR Martin devotees and groupies.
B00518HBD0|4.0|I've been a fan of 3 Doors Down for many years, and I like all of their past albums 5/5 stars, but this time is different for Time of My Life, this album disappoints me just a little bit. I rate this album 4/5 stars, because there isn't one song I really connect to like I've on their previous albums. I know every band evolves after so long, but did they pick the right time to do it, this many years in their career? I personally think they're starting to sound more mainstream, and I don't like that much. Time of My Life is a bit of a change from their previous albums, this album is softer than their previous albums. I don't think this time around, that this album was worth the 3 year wait. This album is still good, but not great like their other albums.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I can't help but think that GRRM is hoping to get more seasons out of HBO. One book per season, so just pad, bulk, and bull your way through, huh George? On one hand, he's a marketing genius: he signed with HBO after the 4th book, and just stopped writing until he could release ADWD at the same time as the series began. I can't imagine he'll let readers get too far ahead of the series, otherwise it may hurt his profits. Thanks, George, for stepping on the backs of your fan base to get a better view. This once loyal fan is pulling herself out of the pile NOW. I even cancelled my HBO, I'm so angry! Maybe he should get Brandon Sanderson to finish it for him, since he seems to have gotten lost somewhere down the line.

075640407X|5.0|So good. I'm pretty picky when it comes to sci-fi/fantasy. This is a little more understated than your typical hero takes on the world novel, and I love love love it for being that way. It reads in a languorous way and leaves many places to stop and think. Gah, it's worth a read. I'm halfway through the second book as we speak and -6 hours of sleep.
B000F9RB9Y|4.0|Because so many classic films get totally fantastic Blu Ray transfers, it's easy for a videophile to get spoiled and start expecting every movie to magically become beautiful in 1080p. That's just not the case, and nowhere is that more evident than here. The Terminator BD is a good quality version of the original, but the original film was shot a bit on the cheap, and it shows in hi def. Intensely grainy night shots, smudgy closeups, and dim indoor shots are all far more apparent here than on DVD or VHS. Keep this in mind when you order- what you're buying is a very faithful version of a rather budget film.    That said, Terminator is as exciting and fantastic now as it was when it first released, and this is the closest you'll come to seeing it as it originally appeared. The lurching endoskeleton of the terminator itself in particular looks wonderful in hi-def; you can really appreciate all the detail that went into it. And if you aren't a total slave to quality, you may actually enjoy the grain, scratches, and other film oddities that are largely missing from today's movies.     The disk itself is pretty basic for a BD, but that means fast loading times, and none of the irritating BR 2.0 novelties that plague T2. Overall I can recommend this as the definitive version of the film to buy new, and an upgrade, though not an essential one, from DVD.
B0000TAZBK|2.0|I'm actually sort of disappointed in the CD's.  All three of them were there, and the original packaging was there.  However, all three jewel cases were crushed.  Disk 1 and disk 3 both have nicks in them, and they skip.  The second cd was perfect though.
1594744769|5.0|An absorbing adventure that begins in the realistic and gradually builds into a convincing carnivalesque story of time travel and an island of misfit kids. The black and white photos included in the text of the novel perform their duty well, revealing the curious abilities of the characters while amplifying the atmosphere of mystery and strangeness. I was completely captivated by this dark fairytale of WWII orphans in the Welsh bogland, trapped in time just like their photo counterparts.

I was rather dubious on buying it - I love urban fantasies, but there are so many books of this genre that are poorly written and audiobooks aren't exactly cheap.<br /><br />Kevin Hearne did NOT disappoint me! I was so pleasantly surprised! He writes very well. The plot and characters are well developed and he combines the perfect mixture of action, lewdness, humor, and wisdom to produce a very entertaining and high quality read.<br /><br />When I arrived in Atlanta, I was actually disappointed because the book wasn't finished yet.

B001RIY4WE|4.0|I'm going to write this review in 2 sections because of my differing feelings about the film itself, and its presentation.<br /><br />First the movie. This is a beautiful version of T2; crisp and richly saturated to the point where it looks brand new. Digital effects often do not age well, but the admittedly early CG in this movie looks fantastic even 2 decades later, as do the masterful animatronics and prop effects. Terminator 2 remains a fantastic hallmark of dramatic action, fusing horror and sci-fi in an amazing unity of pure awesome that feels far faster than its 2-hour running time. Unlike T1, the BD is a definitive step up from DVD for this film, and I can recommend it to fans without hesitation. If you are watching the movie for the first time, this is the way to do it. I've seen T2 probably at least 20 times, but watching this I noticed a load of new stuff. You also get a good deal of deleted content here if you've only seen the theatrical cut before. Most significantly, Miles Dyson, the character who kind of INVENTS SKYNET, was relegated to a bit part in the theatrical cut. Here he and his family (including a daughter who was completely removed in the TC) are far better developed.<br /><br />Now, the disk. This is possibly the most IRRITATING BD I have ever seen, and I own like 3 from Universal. When you first load it, it launches \\"Skynet\\" which looks up where you live and a bunch of local information as it \\"targets you for nuclear strike.\\" It's a cute novelty but it took me over 2 minutes ON DSL and was UNSKIPPABLE. You may not have to put up with it if you turn off your wireless or whatever, but the bottom line is you shouldn't have to wait through a pointless novelty to see your movie. Once you're actually in the menu, you will find that although the theatrical and special edition cuts of the movie are available, the longest director's cut is PASSWORD PROTECTED. This isn't a trivial menu thing, it actually wants a password. I'm told you can skip this using root track selections instead of the BD menu, but it's still an example of the interactivity of BD menus totally running away from the viewer's needs.<br /><br />SOOOOOOOOOooo.....<br /><br />If you like T2, buy this movie in spite of the menu. If you haven't seen it before, buy it but brace yourself. If you don't like terminator and you're just a sad sack who buys every \\"important\\" movie that comes along for collector's value, then I recommend that you get the limited endoskull edition of this off eBay and just watch the DVDs.selections instead of the BD menu, but it's still an example of the interactivity of BD menus totally running away from the viewer's needs.

1439156816|5.0|Stephen King's ON WRITING isn't so much a how-to manual for aspiring writers as it is a revealing portrait of a man who has managed to become one of the most successful writers in the world.  The book is a mix of autobiography, philosophy, and pedagogy, with the overwhelming emphasis on autobiography.  King writes about his childhood, his family, his marriage, and the sale of his first stories and novels.  He also writes about the writing process, but he's still really writing autobiography - he tells us how he writes, the tools he uses, the methods he employs, the schedule he follows, and how it all falls into place for him.  But note:  he's really writing about himself here - and he acknowledges this directly.  He isn't telling his \\"Constant Reader\\" HOW to write, but only showing us how HE writes.  \\"If it works for me,\\" he suggests, \\"it might work for you.\\"<br /><br />I have been drawn to Stephen King's novels and stories since I first read CARRIE back in 1974, and I've come back to him time and again over the years (even though I haven't liked all of his novels - CUJO and PET SEMETARY both annoyed me, and I was never a fan of THE DARK TOWER series).  Something about King's characters always seemed to draw me in - they spoke to me as if they knew me, worming their way inside me until they seemed part of me in ways few literary characters ever managed.  King's books always reminded me of those portraits you see hung in big intimidating offices - you know, the ones with the eyes that seem to follow you wherever you go.  I know the eyes in the portraits aren't really looking at me, that it's the skill of the artist that makes this work, but it's eerie just the same.  And it's King's skill as a writer that allows his characters to play this same role.  If nothing else, ON WRITING will help you see how King works and why his novels have become so ingrained in our culture.  The characters become real for him, which means they become real for his readers.<br /><br />If you want a how-to manual on writing, there are plenty out there (some of them are good; some not so much).  But if you want to be inspired by a man who has managed to be successful at something so many of us (myself included) have only dreamed about, then immerse yourself in ON WRITING.  And hey . . .maybe what works for Mr. King really will work for you (and for me!).  I'm a big believer in dreams!manual on writing, there are plenty out there (some of them are good; some not so much).

B000FCKGPC|5.0|I bought this book in hardcover when it came out in 2005, and like many others, I was sorely disappointed.  I thought that GRRM had mailed it in, but really, I was angry that it had taken five years for the fourth book to come out and I had forgotten almost everything from the first three books in the intervening years.      After watching A Game of Thrones on HBO, and after seeing that A Dance With Dragons was being released in July 2011 (SIX years after A Feast for Crows, when he promised at the end of the book that ADWD would be out the following year!), I decided to re-read the first four books.  It wasn't that I necessarily looked forward to reading those thousands of pages again.  In truth, I was intrigued by how good the HBO series was and decided to re-read the books to see if they were as good as I remembered.      They were even better than I remembered.  Reading all four books one after the other, so many years after the fourth book came out, and knowing that the fifth book was finished and about to be released, I was able to enjoy the series without feeling frustrated at how much longer it might take for the next book to come out.    I am not going to say that A Feast for Crows is as good as the first three books.  It isn't.  It is a slower, more plodding story, by virtue of the fact that it largely deals with the aftermath of all of the wars and fighting that occurred in the first three books.  (Plus, no Tyrion.)  But the story was not as aimless as I remembered it being the first time I read it.      I think GRRM made the right decision in handling the book the way that he did (two books - AFFC and ADWD - that track each other chronologically but deal with different geographical areas).  And with the details of the first three books being fresh in my mind, instead of years old, as they were the first time I read AFFC, I have to say that AFFC was no disappointment.  If the first three books are still fresh in one's mind, AFFC is a great read.  If you wait years between reading the first three books and AFFC, then yes, you will be lost and will likely end up frustrated.      Here is to hoping that we don't have to wait six more years for the sixth book!
0553801473|4.0|Since English is my second language reading this book was tough, but I loved reading it. What made it tough wasn't the quality of the writing -which is impeccable- but the plethora of unnecessary characters that I don't see advancing the story. The characters that we love aren't in control of their destiny but seem mostly reactive. The miracle is that things seem to be coming together despite of that, and the revelations (and cliffhangers) in this book promise a storm of events that will bring this series to a conclusion. Overall a depressing cynical book that I think could've rivaled \\" A Storm of Swords\\" if it was combined as originally planned with \\" A Feast for Crows\\" and the(iron born+ Quentyn + Briene ...etc) were just removed
B004EPYZOO|5.0|My 40 year old daughter brought this over for our regular Friday night \\"pizza and a movie\\" nite.  My first thought was, aww, geeze.... OK, guess I will force myself to watch this.  I am NOT a blood, gore and violence fan... but, though this movie is full of all that, it's kind of a tongue in cheek type, which I can handle.  Loved the plot, the action is wow, the classic cars are dazzling and a little humor here and there keeps you involved!  Car chases, evil cults, murder and mayhem all abound, but in a \\"I know this isn't real\\" kind of way.  I would highly recommend this movie to those who enjoy action movies with an actual plot, seeing good overshadow evil and a movie that has an actual ending. Not a movie for kids.  Very entertaining.

What really saved this CD from being average was the production by Eminem and Dre, which was outstanding. The biggest standout track on this album is definitely No Apologies, which is the only serious song on the album, and shows you that Eminem didn't lose his skills like some thought.

First of all the 1973 Pop mix is the original which is available on disc as Rough Power from Bomp Records. this is the ORIGINAL version that CBS and Mainman entertainment balked at and refused to release. Bowie, being the one who put Iggy and the Stooges on the Mainman/CBS roster was then asked/demanded to fix the problem but at a severe handicap: one day to do it, no money to do it with and on severely outdated recording equipment to do it with. As Iggy Pop recalls:<br /><br />\\"To the best of my recollection it was done in a day. I don't think it was two days. On a very, very old board, I mean this board was old! An Elvis type of board, old-tech, low-tech, in a poorly lit, cheap old studio with very little time. To David's credit, he listened with his ear to each thing and talked it out with me, I gave him what I thought it should have, he put that in its perspective, added some touches. He's always liked the most recent technology, so there was something called a Time Cube you could feed a signal into -- it looked like a bong, a big plastic tube with a couple of bends in it -- and when the sound came out the other end, it sort of shot at you like an echo effect. He used that on the guitar in \\"Gimme Danger,\\" a beautiful guitar echo overload that's absolutely beautiful; and on the drums in \\"Your Pretty Face Is Going To Hell.\\" His concept was, \\"You're so primitive, your drummer should sound like he's beating a log!\\" It's not a bad job that he did...I'm very proud of the eccentric, odd little record that came out.\\"<br /><br />Bowie later recalled:<br /><br />\\"  ...the most absurd situation I encountered when I was recording was the first time I worked with Iggy Pop. He wanted me to mix Raw Power, so he brought the 24-track tape in, and he put it up. He had the band on one track, lead guitar on another and him on a third. Out of 24 tracks there were just three tracks that were used. He said 'see what you can do with this'. I said, 'Jim, there's nothing to mix'. So we just pushed the vocal up and down a lot. On at least four or five songs that was the situation, including \\"Search and Destroy.\\" That's got such a peculiar sound because all we did was occasionally bring the lead guitar up and take it out...\\"<br /><br />CBS even requested or demanded if you will, that the album Raw Power contain at least 2 ballads. I can't even begin to think who the heck in their right mind would even request such a thing from a band like the Stooges. But comply they did...in a very Stooges way. The Bowie mix is a compromise mix. Record companies are in the business of selling records and the Stooges had been dropped by Elektra for this very reason: lack of interest=very poor sales. Bowie softened the mix and I believe in all fairness was honestly trying to help the Stooges by making their sound more accessible. And...it didn't work. It is the equivalent to trying to tame a tiger so that the audience won't run out of the circus tent in fear for their life.  23 years later and Sony with it's newly minted Legacy imprint, approaches Iggy to remaster the now better late than never classic album to his specifications and set the record straight. The 1997 Pop mix is the equivalent of letting the tiger out of the cage and then kicking it in the ass on it's way out. We can only speculate and take Pop on his word that this is the way he originally wanted the album to be mixed and thus enjoyed if elements like being at a career cross roads, label pressure, a band that still had an acidic relationship, Iggy's authority issues and...well heroine hadn't factored into the genesis of Raw Power.<br /><br />Is the newer Bowie mix remastered? Yes, and it does sound the better for it in regards to it's previous incarnations ie: the vinyl and 1990 CD releases. Does it do the music and musicianship justice? No, and both Bowie and Pop agree with that in some regards. Does the '97 Raw Power give a better representation of the craftsmanship of the songs? I say yes. But this is my preference in the way I want to listen to it. I like the anger levels of it. No, there is NO sound clipping on this master as some might have you believe. Distortion yes and in heavy doses. But the CD does not sound clip (regarding the '97 mix). Listen carefully and you can ascertain this: guitar distorts at certain peaks yet Iggy's vocals do not. Ever. This is purposeful analog distortion to give this album a sonic \\"coming apart at the seems\\" feel. And it works. There is much more breadth and nuance now to the songs and the rest of the bands playing, especially the bass and drums which as compared to the Bowie mix are damn near non-existent on several tracks. The two songs that benefit the most from the '97 mix are \\"Give Me Danger\\" and \\"Penetration\\" with the now very clear Xylophone brought up to audible levels. And personally I can not picture \\"Shake Appeal\\" without the \\"1 2 3\\" count off that ignites it. Is the '97 Pop mix original? No. But neither is the '73 Bowie mix. It was just the first one released. And the one that conjures the most nostalgia from it's fans. That their are fans of this classic and very import record is the most important part. Let them have their versions that mean the most to them.<br /><br />I'm giving the remaster Bowie mix 4 out of 5 based simply on the mix itself. the music gets 5 stars. No, 6 as far as I'm concerned.p agree with that in some regards. Does the '97 Raw Power give a better representation of the craftsmanship of the songs? I say yes.

0553801473|5.0|I've seen reviewers expressing disappointment, because the story didn't move quickly enough, some plot point they had hoped to see resolved was not, or there was a lot of irrelevant and pointless filler. They seem to forget that this book is one seventh of a bigger story. We cannot possibly dismiss certain events as irrelevant until we've read the final page of the final book.<br /><br />I found it just as intriguing as the previous books in the series. I am genuinely interested in all the characters that remain. I know more about the history of the story now than before. Plenty of exciting things happened. I have no complaints and look forward to the next books in the series. Hopefully Martin will write with haste, lest the final volume becomes my retirement gift, decades from now.
B005AUWXZ0|2.0|This was my children's first trip to the movies. Neither one of them liked it. Too much action, too much death, the storylines were too complex, not enough of the core characters, and it did not have the heart of Cars. BIG LETDOWN! If I let my son he would watch cars everyday. My daughter and son play cars all the time. My daughter told me that she did not really want to see cars 2 again. Maybe the movie is for 8-10 year olds?
B00004WKII|5.0|what I really like is the alternate version of tunes i am so used to hearing.don't get me wrong,i love jimi.but after hearing different versions of ezy rider,astro man and spanish castle magic[instrumental]it was exciting.little wing is different so is freedom.the sound is excellent and the overall package is well done.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book it really made me want to read the next. I spent three days and in my spare time all i did was read this series. I loved it so much my friends all said that this was defienelty a book I had to read. You HAVE to read these books!!
B003UMW68O|5.0|This is one of my family's favorite movies.  We ordered about a dozen Disney movies on Blue Ray and this movie was the first one for us to watch.  LOVE IT!
B0049GYXDG|5.0|My daughter (now in her 30's) and I wore out our VCR watching this when she was a child.  We both loved it and never grew weary of it; and that's saying something. I do have a warning: you must possess a sense of humour and enjoy fantasy.  The colors are magnificient, the story is crazy, and the characters are insane!  The Chesire Cat especially is pure brilliance!  Ignore the negative reviews, open your mind and embark on a fabulous journey.  I did, and it's a journey I will cherish always.
030745455X|4.0|Blomkvist, along with his magazine and a free-lance journalist, plan to report on an investigation into Sweeden's sex trafficking business.  With a chapter left to write, the free-lance journalist and his girlfriend are brutally murdered in their apartment.  Simultaneously, Lisbeth's guardian is murdered with a gun containing her finger prints.  Suspected of all three murders, Lisbeth finds herself the target of a massive police hunt.  I found this book to be an interesting mix of action and mystery.  It focused more on Lisbeth's life than the previous book, yet left several mysteries unresolved.  Overall, I quite enjoyed this book, and would recommend it to others.
159448385X|4.0|This book is just as good as the author's other novel, The Kite Runner. The perspective of life in Afghanistan is told more from a woman's viewpoint as opposed to The Kite Runner which is a male viewpoint. I feel the key to getting along with others is through education and understanding and this book certainly gives insight to what the women living in Afghanistan have faced since before the Russian invasion.
B00004XMV6|2.0|Reading through the positive reviews, I find some of them insightful, yet I still feel they exaggerate the depth of the relationship between the two characters.  I found it difficult to care for either one of them.  I don't find manipulation, humiliation, and game-playing very erotic.  A man who can't get excited unless he's degrading a woman, and a woman who appears to find that attractive, are not what I consider sexy.  For me the point of this film was waiting to see how long it would take Kim Basinger to finally snap and decide she wasn't going to put up with it anymore.  It took her too long, and I found it hard to respect a character who has so little respect for herself.  Rourke's smug arrogance was also not very endearing.  I felt like this movie was putting me on, and I couldn't wait for it to end.
0553801473|5.0|I completely enjoyed this book.  How much you enjoy it will depend a lot on what you, as a reader, look for in a novel.  This is a rich, detailed story and it spends a lot of time on building the world and its characters.  It is true that the overarching story of the series progresses little in this installment, and if that is the main attraction for you, then you are going to be frustrated by this book.  I totally understand.  Many people were hoping certain long-running questions might be answered, such as Jon Snow's parentage, or that the looming threat of an invasion by the Others might begin.  Instead this book gives us questions and cliffhangers, and a lot of character journeys that never quite reach a destination.  But if what you come to this story looking for is a wonderfully textured part of a longer journey, then there is so much here to appreciate and love.<br /><br />After reading A Feast For Crows, where we were only treated to half of the character perspectives, this novel picks up at the end of A Storm Of Swords, telling us the other half of the story.  This is the story of Jon Snow, Tyrion, and Daenerys.  But there are other stories here too, and some even more interesting than these \\"main\\" characters.  I found myself unexpectedly cheering on a character that previously I had nothing but loathing for, and watching with fascination as the other players make their moves in the grand scheme of the story.<br /><br />Up on the Wall, Jon Snow has been named the 998th commander of the Night's Watch.  After centuries of fighting the dangerous people known as the wildlings that live north of the wall, Jon begins to reach out to them in peace as the threat of a far greater enemy draws ever nearer.  His unpopular decisions strain the Night's Watch, even as King Stannis places ever greater demands on him in his attempt to unify the North under his rule.  I was very fond of Jon Snow's chapters.  He has never been my favorite character, but he's one of the most honorable men in Martin's world.  But as a leader, he is forced to make gray choices in an attempt to save lives, and maybe the entire realm.  His arc has been more interesting since his time among the wildlings, and never more than now.<br /><br />In the east, Tyrion flees his sister's wrath and makes his way toward the rumored \\"Dragon Queen\\" Daenerys.  Since the beginning of the series, Tyrion has always had his noble family name and wealth at his back; now stripped of these, he is forced to make do as just another dwarf in a world where the strong have no use for the weak.  Along the way he will uncover a secret that may well unbalance the entire game of thrones in the west.<br /><br />Daenerys now rules in the east, but her rule is a fragile one.  She has the might of an army and the only three living dragons in the world, but her attempts to end slavery have turned the hearts of the people against her.  She tries to become the leader she was born to be, but discovers that the cost of a crown is a dear one.  I was hoping to see a little more movement in Dany's chapters, but the character frustrates me sometimes, much as I love her.  Her quest to regain the throne of Westeros has stalled.  But her struggles had my whole attention, even as I wished she had a certain cynical dwarf around to give her an irreverent hand with things.  Her dragons are growing.  No longer are they the cute, mascot-characters of the series.  With one horrifying moment they are revealed to be true monsters, perhaps beyond control.  Dany also gets the absolute best moment in the story, which I'm not going to spoil for you here.<br /><br />The writing is excellent, as always.  This is a story for people who like their fantasy worlds with lots of detail.  Nowhere is this more apparent than in the characters themselves.  I mentioned earlier that a certain character I used to hate had my love this time around.  I won't tell you who it is, but his story was probably the most emotionally compelling of the whole book.  Even more than the world, with its dragons and magic and undead terrors, Martin's characters are what shines in his stories.  Even the ones you hate have you watching their arcs with fascination, unable to look away.  (Roose Bolton and particularly his unholy monster of a son are terrific villains, the kind you just keep watching and waiting for them to get what they deserve.)<br /><br />For a book that is criticized for not progressing the story very much, a lot happens.  The dragons that used to be almost cuddly become real horrors.  A young princess continues her dark training.  A once-proud prince tries to rise from the ruin his life has become.  An old knight tries to solve a deadly mystery.  A priestess does whatever she can to aid the one she believes will fulfill an ancient prophecy.  Jon Snow tries to make peace with the wildlings in the face of a greater evil.  Dany rules as a stranger, seemingly turning her back on her destiny.  A prince and a pirate both journey along different paths in search of the dragons and their beautiful queen.  Tyrion also seeks out the young queen, in the hope that she will help him achieve his own vengeful purpose.  A couple of Freys get exactly what they deserve in one of the book's subtler moments.  A young boy journeys into the deep north, led by a dead man.  And a master manipulator finally shows his hand.  There is also a lot of action and mayhem, love and death.  Not a single page is wasted, if you can appreciate it.  And I think you will.<br /><br />If I was ranking this among Martin's other books, I would probably put it somewhere in the middle.  It is much better than A Feast For Crows, but not quite at the level of A Storm Of Swords.  And for the most part, it is telling the other half of the story in A Feast For Crows, so not every character I love made an appearance this time around.  This makes it feel a little incomplete, in that parts of the story are being ignored.  But the story it does tell is so richly told and engaging, that I really didn't miss the rest that much.  And in a pleasantly surprising move, the stories start to catch up to each other near the end, so a few unexpected characters make appearances, for which I am very thankful.  (Happily, even my favorite character showed up for a couple of chapters, which I didn't think was going to happen this time around.)  If I were reviewing this book in comparison to the rest of the series, I would probably give it 4 or 4 and1/2 stars, since it is not the best, but still very good.  And there are moments in it that rival the best moments in the entire saga.  But when I compare it to the rest of the books I've been reading this year, and to fantasy literature in general, then it stands far enough above what's out there that it deserves nothing less than 5 stars.  It's a great book.  Not the best in the series, but an imperfect novel in this series still stands above almost anything else in fantasy you are going to read this year.  This is easily the best work of fantasy I've read this year, and I don't expect it to be surpassed until Martin releases The Winds Of Winter next summer (I can dream, can't I?).  It is a beautiful chapter of a terrific fantasy epic, and I loved it.<br /><br />Final Grade: A-ng of the whole book.

B003E6K1VK|3.0|First some disclosure. I didn't purchase the FiiO E7. Instead, I purchased the iBasso D4. The D4 has similar specs. It uses the same Wolfson WM8740 DAC (although it has dual DACs) and the same TI PCM2706 USB chip. Based on my research, the D4 is considered superior to the E7 (but at twice the price!).      I recently purchased a pair of Ultrasone 580 headphones and was instantly \\"in love\\" with them. They represented a huge step up from the ear buds and Sennheiser PCX-100 headphones that I was using with my laptop and iPad. The Ultrasone 580's are 32 ohms and easily driven by both my laptop and my iPad. My laptop has a SoundMAX HD Audio card which has a 20bit/48kHz DAC and produced pretty good sound with no noticeable issues. My primary source of music is MOG dot com. MOG's streams are 320kbps MP3s. Not lossless or HD audio, but still pretty good.    Along the way of researching what headphones to buy, I discovered the world of headphone DACs and amps. After spending too much time reading posts on sites like head-fi dot com, I started to wonder if I was missing out. Could adding a headphone DAC/amp result in another noticeable improvement?     The short answer for me was \\"not really\\". I suspect that the D4 produces marginally better sound than my laptop (I am using the USB connection, BTW), but I seriously doubt that in a blind test that I could tell the difference. It sounds great, but my laptop and iPad sound great without it, too. I have not yet \\"burned in\\" my D4, but I'm having a hard time believing burning in solid state hardware will make any difference.    Unless you are trying to overcome some issue, like a noisy soundcard, high impedance headphones, or a sound card that sounds noticeable worse than say, your iPhone 4 or receiver, save your money. Unless you have \\"golden ears\\" like the people (supposedly) do over on head-fi, I doubt you'll hear a significant enough difference to justify the price of entry.    Of course, my experience might differ from others.I was already getting pretty good sound from my sound card. I didn't spend a lot of time making comparisons on my iPad. But in the little testing that I did, I didn't notice a significant difference there either.
030726999X|3.0|As the third and final book in the trilogy, I found this book less exciting that its predecessors.  Things seemed a bit too...easy...for Lisbeth, who spends the majority of the book in the hospital.  Everything just seems to fall in place.  Overall, I thought it lacked the tension and anxiety of the other books.  Despite these criticisms, I found Larsson to be an extremely talented author, one who I wish published more books before his death.

1451629184|3.0|WOW, like so many I reserved on Amazon after watching the Diane Sawyer interview.  What an amazing young lady she is.  It was easy to see the pain still in her mother, but yet Jaycee seems to be doing great.  The book was a must and I was so thrilled when I got it on my Kindle.  I love how the writer softens every harsh detail with mind altering attempts to day dream.  One question that kept coming to mind with each chapter, she references her step dad \\"Carl\\" so much and almost always in such a negative way, makes me question why she seems to \\"beat\\" him up in the book but seldom does of the man who stole her life for 18 years.   It true is a remarkable story of the will and courage of a young girl who know has all the brightness back in her life FINALLY!  The world is at your hands now Jaycee, spread your wings and fly, you will SOAR![[ASIN:1451629184 A Stolen Life: A Memoir]]
1451629184|5.0|I read this book in a few hours and was overwhelmed by the strength and heroism of this young woman. I immediately lent it to someone who was going through a \\"difficult\\" time with the hope that Jaycee's story will inspire my friend as much as it did me. I was surprised how well written it was and especially was impressed with the way she used her reflections to give us an insight on how well she is doing now. I will support her foundation and expect that she will continue to have an inspiring life.
B003Y5H53S|4.0|From the trailers, \\"Rango\\" appeared to be a laugh-out-loud, fun, somewhat subversive, but mostly shallow story for the kids. Instead, it's a clever tale about discovering yourself and the need for community, while incorporating sly nods at the entire art of storytelling and screenwriting. It's comedy, adventure, high-noon cowboy fun, mixed in with esoteric bits of wisdom and some dark, scary moments for children.<br /><br />Rango is a lizard thrown from the back of a car traveling through the desert. After meeting a philosophizing armadillo, he wanders off into the heat and sand in search of very real, yet metaphoric, water. He comes upon the town of Dirt, realizes that water is kept in a vault in the town bank, and the mayor is using water as a symbol of hope and religious coercion over the townspeople. Rango's arrival, however, upends the mayor's plans when Rango inadvertently becomes a hero and tries to live up to his self-created mythology. Of course, not all comes easily for the well-meaning lizard, and even his own hopes of love and friendship become victims to his ultimate cowardice and inability. It's in those moments that he must discover not only who he is, but why he should be who he is. It's not about him. It's about others.<br /><br />Many life lessons lie hidden in this story, some more obvious than others. It has some truly funny moments, and some truly frightening moments for kids. It has some truly wise moments. There's a scene early in the movie during which Rango begins using his chameleon abilities to hide, but finds himself distracted and becomes the target of a hawk. He escapes. The antics had me laughing out loud. And I was fully engaged. But in much the same way, \\"Rango\\" the movie is a chameleon that attempts to disguise itself in a number of different ways without ever fully succeeding.<br /><br />So, is this chameleon a film aimed at adults, at children, or at all of the above? It's hard to tell. Personally, I really enjoyed it, and there is something here for everyone. I just wonder if everyone will get it.ryone. I just wonder if everyone will get it.

B004K4IZ3G|5.0|Unfortunately this installment of Tron is graphically superior than the orginal. Of course seeing the first Tron movie as a kid I was floored, eyes glued to the screen. It's nice that after decades the movie that raised the bar visually is still leading the pack.
B004ZGYEKC|5.0|It 's sad that it 's taken so many many years for this album to be released in true stereo . This by far is one of the best albums  to come out of the 60 's . Now , if only the Rolling Stones or whom ever holds the rights would finally release their singles in  stereo , such as Satisfaction , The Last Time etc. Some of these hits were on compilations or bootlegs over the years .
B00518HBD0|5.0|.            I think this is quite possibly the best album 3 doors down has ever released, followed closely by their last release. When you're Young, Heaven, Time of My Life, all of the songs on this album I love and I absolutely love that because I hate when I buy a cd and there is only one or two good songs and the rest are throw away.  I personally think 3dd has gotten better every go round. The first few albums there was always a few songs I didn't really get into but on \\"Three Doors Down\\" and \\"Time Of My Life\\", I absolutely love them all. I have heard critics talk down 3 Doors Down and I could care less. I love 3 Doors Down and obviously I'm not the only one. They've been around all these years and released numerous albums for a reason. These so called \\"Critics\\" as far as I'm concerned can go back to listening to their Taylor Swift garbage. I'll Stay Right Here!
B004U52VPS|5.0|This toy is definitely not for anyone below 3 yrs of age.  I do have a toddler running around the house and his big brother makes sure he does not reach the \\"small birds\\".  My older son is a total angry birds fan.  He enjoys the game and he uses his building skills to create new \\"pig\\" habitats to destroy. Now granted this is not a classic \\"learning toy\\", my kid does not mind it one bit and it does engage his imagination.  He still enjoys playing Angry Birds HD on my Ipad, PC, and phone but he likes to see the birds knock the pigs down beyond the tablet screen. The rules are simple to explain to your child and the cards are pretty interesting to use especially when building the different configurations. Cards or no cards, I just let my child build his own configurations in addition to what is there. Overall it's a fun addition to the ever growing Angry Birds collection in the house.

B001FB4W0W|1.0|I expected to like this series since I really like the books.  To say that the TV series is \\"loosely based\\" on the books is an understatement.  The only things they have in common are the names of the characters and the fact that Sookie can read minds and that Bill is a vampire.  Really a disappointment!
1400052173|4.0|This book is well written and presents a historic review about how medical research and specific doctors and companies took, without permission, the cells of a poor cancer stricken southern black woman, replicated them, and sent them all over the world for research. The book documents how specific firms and individuals have made hundreds of millions of dollars from the sales of her cells, yet every doctor and every company selling them and using them, still today, refuse to donate one single dollar to her estate or her family.  It is a commentary of how backward the medical research industry was and is still today.  These companies still today refuse to donate even a single dollar per purchase of her cells, even thought they charge large substantial sums for each shipment, with some sales in the hundreds of dollars per small tiny casual of her cells.

B004SIP6N6|5.0|This movie may not seem like the best candidate for Blu-ray, but you would be wrong to think that this is not an improvement. The high resolutions of this format may not resolve any more picture resolution, but it does manager to resolve the original texture of the film. If you are a true videophile, the film grain certainly adds to the 16mm film experience. In addition, this film includes a plethora of special features including trivia, making of's for both Clerks and Jay and Silent Bob Strike back, and the original \\"downer\\" ending, previously available on the Clerks X DVD. This certainly is the definitive version.

B001UV4XIS|5.0|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2<br />Directed by David Yates<br />Starring Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Ralph Fiennes, Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith<br /><br />Warner Bros.   2011   130 min   Rated PG-13   Released Jul 15, 2011 (Theaters)<br /><br />The Film 4.5/5<br /><br />I'm a fan of the Harry Potter franchise. I have read all of the books and own the first seven movies. My favorite in the series is the Prisoner of Azkaban, while I rate Deathly Hallows Part 1 as the weakest entry.<br /><br />It seems that Part 1 moves slowly and contains too many insignificant scenes. In contrast, this final installment feels a little rushed. It runs about two hours before the credits start to roll and tries to cram in the final showdown, while tying up as many loose ends as possible. Some of the threads are resolved using rather clumsy exposition and deserved more screen time. My final quibble involves the use of quick cuts to increase the sense of action. The story was good enough to do that on its own and I didn't feel that it was necessary to turn some of the scenes into something resembling Bourne.<br /><br />Although the movie isn't perfect, it's still a fine way to end a thoroughly enjoyable franchise.<br /><br />I can't imagine that this final entry will be seen by many people who avoided the first seven movies, and that's a good thing. The story picks up right where Part 1 ended and introduces us to many of the characters from the first seven movies. It wouldn't have much impact as a standalone movie and it's not supposed to. I'm interested in seeing the two final parts together to see whether Part 1 works better. In fact, I'll watch all eight movies when the final Blu-ray is released.<br /><br />The story follows Harry, Ron and Hermione in their search for the remaining horcruxes. The first hunt is a spectacular affair which is heavy on the special effects and action. I'm aware that many viewers will not have read the books, so I'm not going to spoil anything. If you read the final book, you'll be aware of which sequence I'm referring to.<br /><br />For anyone who complained about the absence of scenes involving Hogwarts in Part 1, much of the action takes place at the school in this concluding part. What struck me is how different Hogwarts looked when we were first introduced to the world of Harry Potter. Gone are the vibrant colors and whimsical interactions with ghosts or paintings. Instead, be prepared to enter a dark setting. I mean that literally as the setting is extremely dim for about 95 percent of the movie; think Gotham City for a comparison.<br /><br />Another thing that I noticed is how much the acting has improved. The main characters were around 11 years old when the franchise was born, so they are about 21 now. Radcliffe held his own in scenes involving some of the best British character actors of their generation. Watson and Grint played their parts well, and it's a tribute to the original casting that the franchise has developed as well as it has.<br /><br />It should be noted how important some of the supporting actors are to the success of the franchise. Can you imagine anyone other than Alan Rickman as Snape? His story is one of the most interesting in the series and sees a fitting conclusion. I'm also fond of Maggie Smith's portrayal of McGonagall and love her role in the final installment. You'll see actors that have appeared infrequently given a little recognition, and they deserve it.<br /><br />I watched the movie with a large audience made up of children and adults into their sixties. Although the sense of evil was always present and the setting was dark, the audience found plenty of scenes worthy of laughter. It's a truly entertaining movie.<br /><br />The movie might have improved if 30 minutes were added so that everything felt less rushed, but it could have affected the tension if we were given more chances to breathe. The sense of scale reminded me of some of the battles seen in Lord of the Rings. Replace Voldemort's minions with orcs, and there were quite a few similarities.<br /><br />Fans of the Harry Potter franchise, and I am among them, will be pleased with the way everything is wrapped up. After a disappointment in Part 1, the conclusion was worthy of the story created in the first seven movies. To see who lives, who dies, and what happens to the survivors, you'll have to check it out for yourself. I thoroughly recommend the experience.<br /><br />The Blu-ray release should be spectacular, despite the grim setting. The explosions and battle scenes will rock your home theater.ies.

B004XJHBCE|5.0|I'll make this short and sweet. This is not a fake review (notice the 'real name' next to this reviewer's sig).  I've had this app since it was in beta over a year ago. Was the first purchase I made on my Evo.  Best investment EVER.  It not only organizes existing apps but lets you make new shortcuts to just about anything (Apps, Contacts, bookmarks , etc..)  Those new shortcuts are usable where normal 'shortcuts' are not, hence it does not duplicate android os functions, it EXPANDs them.  Fully integration with Titanium Backup lets you utilize this apps groups while backuping.  Apps can be in multiple 'groups', groups can be placed in groups (creating true navigation menus if you wish).  It does NOT slow the phone down. (Though the menus themselves in the app might get slow'ish' if you have over 500+ apps as I do.  With normal amounts of apps installed, it's very snappy once it creates it initial 'cache').    Best app for the  money... and it's even FREE right now. Cannot beat this deal.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This movie made a huge impact on me.  Its simplicity makes it one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time and I've been recommending it to everyone.  Please take time to watch this one.  The only thing that could have made it better was to have seen Clint Eastwood in the lead role! :)
B0036EH3WU|5.0|I really liked watching the whole series of Lost.

B004M9AS3Y|5.0|I needed a light, compact backpack that would hold my dslr and 3 lenses, plus my netbook or laptop. I also wanted quick access to my camera without having to take the backpack off. My main uses for this bag are as a carry-on/under-seat pack during travel, and for day trips/light hiking.<br /><br />After looking at just about every backpack that exists (or at least what's available online), I narrowed it down to this and the Lowepro Fastpack 250. I ordered both and ended up keeping the Compuday Photo 250. The Fastpack 250 was great, but quite a bit bulkier than this one. It also looks more like a camera bag, where as this one does not. If you were to remove the small Lowepro logo patch it would be even stealthier.<br /><br />This pack is well made, well designed and carried just the right amount for my needs (camera, lenses, netbook, plus a bit of room for other misc items. If I bring my netbook, I can also fit my kindle, stacked above the netbook in the laptop compartment. I can even fit my Slik Pro V mini tripod in it, along with everything else (this tripod is only 14\\" folded). There are plenty of pockets and compartments to organize my stuff, and it's well-padded to protect the contents. The side camera compartment is great - it allows quick camera access (almost as convenient as with a shoulder bag), but has the increased carrying comfort of a backpack (however to change lenses, you'd need to take the bag off, not so with a shoulder bag). I can carry this thing for hours without any discomfort, but with a shoulder bag, I'd have a sore neck after an hour or so. The shoulder straps are comfortable and easily adjustable, however there is no chest/waist strap (not really needed, considering the relatively light load one would be carrying in this pack). The only things I would suggest are adding a couple of loops on the sides and top to attach bungies and clip-on accessories, and using a waterproof (non woven) material for the bottom.<br /><br />The price is also quite reasonable for what you get. Highly recommended.t. Highly recommended.
B004XJHBCE|2.0|What would be really useful would be a way to put widgets into folders, so that the widgets are hidden, then I open the folder, and now I can see the widgets.  That's what I thought this one was going to do, based on the description, but when they say widgets, they mean only their own widgets, which is basically just a folder that you open up to see normal app shortcuts inside of.  I'm not sure where this stands out.    Decent folder alternative, though, if you don't want to get a full Home screen replacement app.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|I bought this book because I was interested in how the author would tie together a narrative from the perspective of a woman with memory loss and the inability to retain new memories.  The plot is interesting, and it wasn't too long of a read, but I thought it could have been about 3/4 the length (or maybe even less) and still tell the same story.  The main character (woman with memory loss) wakes up every morning and has to re-learn everything she learned in the last chapter.  On one hand this process is true to the character, but on the other I was a little tired of reading the same realizations over and over.  All of the action takes place at the end of the book, in fact, until the end, I thought the book was less of a mystery and more of a \\"coming-to-terms-with-myself\\" type of book.  The major revelations and action at VERY END of the book are exciting, but I felt that the \\"clues\\" near the end could have been sprinkled about throughout the book to make it more interesting and less of an \\"out of nowhere\\" ending.  In the end, I liked it, but I don't necessarily feel like I got my money's worth.
1451629184|5.0|Jaycee Dugard was heinously kidnapped before finishing the fifth grade...yet she is able to express herself beautifully in her own thoughtful words. This is perhaps the saddest story I have ever encountered...Jaycee had not had a great childhood experience previous to falling victim to Phillip and Nancy Garrido. She was dealing with a difficult stepfather who was hyper critical of her and whom she felt did not like her. So it was a bit of a \\"perfect storm\\" when the Garridos' randomly chose her as their victim while she was walking to school. She was walking alone per an unwise choice made by the stepfather. She was a shy, compliant child...easy prey for the despicable couple.  She was to suffer unbelievable horrors at the hands of Phillip Garrido for 18 years. Amazingly she tells the story of how she managed to cope with so much grace....the love of her mother had implanted its self very deeply in her psyche and she held on to it very tightly through all of her hours of captivity....through the birth of two daughters and being relentlessly emotionally manipulated.  She shares with the reader many journal entries that she wrote over the years and they are mesmerizing. I am so very impressed by this wonderful girl...she tells us very candidly what she endured and yet remained resilliant enough to come through her ordeal with enough of her spirit intact and innate intelligence to be able to participate in and to understand the intensive therapy necessary for her recovery.  I will never be quite the same as I was before sharing Jaycee's story....I reccomend it to absolutely everyone. She is lovely.

0765365278|4.0|I enjoyed the characters in this book, the psychological struggle Kaladin went through, the battle for understanding and honour that Dalinar underwent and also the subterfuge of Shallan. Despite feeling that there was a 600 page story here that was told in 1250 pages, I have also come to understand that when one picks up a book of this magnitude, with 9 more to come, one has to expect a long haul. Epic fantasy is no quick fix and often we get to experience life in \\"real-time\\". I will be reading all the installments in hope that they will be as good!

B003YL4LYI|3.0|I am about to embark on reading this latest installment, and I'm scared.  The pace had already started drifting from midway through book 3.  When I suffered through Feast for Crows and the sudden focus on minutes of time instead of months of time, I was reminded of the words on the inside jacket of my first edition hardcover of A Game of Thrones:<br /><br />\\"In this exciting first installment of the Song of Ice and Fire TRILOGY....\\"<br /><br />This explains a lot.  Three became, perhaps, seven.  Perhaps more.  Yep, I'm scared.

B0013D8LCW|5.0|The more and more I linger on this film, the more and more I like it.  The story isn't perfect by any means - in fact there are many parts of it that are really unrealistic.  Yet at the same time, everything is done in a realistic fashion.  I really appreciated this movie for the non-stereotypical gay characters and this being a coming-out movie with other focuses trumping it.  A lot of depth to this movie - kept me interested from start to finish.

B0041KKYBA|3.0|What this film has taught is that Iceland is a fantastically beautiful nation and that we should all try to visit it one day.      It is hard to take a film seriously when George Soros, a self-proclaimed Marxist, says he knows nothing about credit-default swaps and is painted as an angel or when Barney Frank, a chief witness to the operations and subsquent breakdown of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, talks as though he was on the sidelines the whole time and watched from a distance. This kind of film-making is really the story: blatant disregard for showing both sides were culpable instead of just the GOP. It would raise the profile of the film much more if both the left and right were treated equally; it would probably sell more copies too, fyi. Hard to expect anything less from Hollywood than what this film puts out though and most (informed) people who purchase this probably know it going in.  I hope. 3 stars for going through the effort of getting some-high profile people to talk (each was probably told a different reason for the interview) and limited amusing entertainment.

B004SQS9FA|5.0|I have listened to this album 50+ times and it just becomes more incredible with each listen. I bought it the day that it was released, and, to be honest, on the first few listens I was a little shocked. I just didn't know what to make of it, but with each subsequent listen I have fallen deeper in love with the album. That's just the way Radiohead has always worked for me. I have to listen to each album a few times before it just hits me, suddenly, that I am listening to something incredible. Radiohead has to seep into my being and take hold of my mind, my essence, everything. Then suddenly, I realize that the music matches the emotions that crawl around in the deepest most remote parts of my mind. Granted, this album is different than their previous albums, but the same can be said of Ok Computer, Kid A, In Rainbows, etc. I am not insisting that everyone must love this, but I think there is a lot to appreciate about the subtle beauty of this album. So, if you listen to this masterful work on the right day, you just might find yourself hooked on its beauty.     P.s. In my opinion this is one of the most beautiful spring time albums in existence. I had the experience of enjoying the album while sitting in a beautiful park on a mild spring day and that just made the album come to life in ways that I never imagined possible.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This is a very well written account of Jaycee's life and all that she had to endure. Having a young daughter, however, it was difficult to read this and has taken me much time whereas other books I fly through. I can't read through it in one sitting - it's too much to take all at once. The entire ordeal breaks my heart but, on the other hand, I give Kudos to this strong woman and I applaud her for taking care of her daughters throughout it all.

B000002LQR|5.0|I knew I had to face this monster some day.<br /><br />First off, I have to put it out there, Rick Rubin is one hell of a producer. I've heard his productions from all spectrums( [[ASIN:B000062X9D American Recordings]], [[ASIN:B000RZGFZM South of Heaven]], [[ASIN:B0000024JN Licensed to Ill]]), but this album, I can truly call his masterpiece.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000078DOI Mother's Milk]] introduced me to four funky cats from LA. While production on Mother's Milk was good, Blood Sugar Sex Magik was totally something else altogether (Get the Funky Monks video and you will see why)[[ASIN:6305750467 Red Hot Chili Peppers: Funky Monks]].<br /><br />Like all Red Hot Chili Pepper albums, Anthony was all libido (Suck My Kiss, Sir Psycho Sexy, Blood Sugar Sex Magik), but he still managed to kick out some socially conscious songs (The Power of Equality, The Righteous and The Wicked, Under the Bridge).<br /><br />This album also showed John Frusciante's evolution as a guitarist (all of his solos are amazing, My Lovely Man and Sir Psycho Sexy to name a few). Flea and Chad were also phenomenal.<br /><br />What the Power of Equality started was the coolest journey. Having become familiar with every song the only gripe I could say I have is that I felt that Sir Psycho Sexy should have been the final song instead of They're Red Hot, because John Frusciante's solo at the end of Sir Psycho Sexy made it seem like the closing credits of a movie, which made the whole album play like a movie than a collection of songs.<br /><br />No Chili Pepper album has come close to the beast that Blood Sugar Sex Magik is.
B003UESJH4|4.0|\\"The King's Speech\\" is a perfectly good, Masterpiece-Theatre sort of movie that does not in any way live up to all the praise and awards heaped on it. As other reviewers have noted, it's Oscar bait: a period piece with great attention to detail, World War II on the horizon (Oscar loves World War II), a triumph over personal adversity, and a prestigious cast with English accents.     I don't think anyone doesn't know the simple plot but just in case SPOILER ALERT: Albert, the second son of England's King George V, has a severe stammer that makes public speaking torture for him and his audiences. A year after his father's death, he is forced to take the throne as George VI when his older brother, Edward VIII, abdicates to marry the twice-divorced American parvenue Wallis Simpson. Lionel Logue is a failed Australian actor who sets himself up in London as a speech therapist. The film covers the professional and personal relationship that develops between Logue and the King as they strive to control the King's stammer enough that he can address and inspire his people when necessary.    The casting and performances are almost uniformly excellent. Helena Bonham Carter brings a delightful balance of hauteur and humor to the underwritten role of Queen Elizabeth. Geoffrey Rush, who can be an awful ham, is understated and convincing as Logue. Eve Best is pitch-perfect in her small role as Wallis Simpson. Guy Pearce brings Edward VIII's combination of good looks, charm and selfish petulance to life. Michael Gambon and Claire Bloom haunt the movie as George VI's distant, demanding parents, George V and Queen Mary. Colin Firth does not look as much like his real life counterpart as the other actors, but his characterization of the reluctant King as a decent man, forced by circumstances into a role for which he is ill-suited and does not want, but determined to serve his country to the best of his ability, is entirely convincing. Firth, Rush and Carter make you care, very much, how things turn out for the King. My only qualm with the casting was Timothy Spall as Winston Churchill. I like Spall as an actor, but he reminded me of Churchill about as much as French bulldog reminds me of an English bulldog, which is to say hardly at all.      The production design is lovely--my goodness, how often does one remark favorably on the wallpaper in a movie?    Part of the movie's weakness is the script.  I happen to know this chapter of history pretty well, but found myself constantly having to answer \\"why is this happening?\\" questions for my husband and son. (It may be of interest that an 8-year-old boy found this movie pretty engaging for the most part--and I found the swear words in this R-rated movie far less objectionable than the violence in many PG-13s.) The script covers a lot of  ground, but it doesn't go very deep--perhaps because there just isn't that far to go.     I'm an Anglophile and I get a kick out of the Royal Family. I enjoyed this movie very much for these reasons and the fact that it's well done.     However, \\"The King's Speech\\" is neither a terribly dramatic drama nor a hilariously funny comedy, it doesn't have much quotable dialogue, and it just doesn't seem like the sort of memorable film-making that should be a \\"Best Picture\\" winner.  It's not the first Oscar-winner that didn't live up to its hype, and it won't be the last. It is, however, a good movie, well worth your time if you are interested in this particular slice of history and enjoy good acting.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|To the last guy yes it works in Xoom and I hope you change your rating because of ignorance. I think even the haters that put bs negative reviews just for the sake of giving negative reviews love this app. this is an awesome organizer and even more useful for the Xoom because of its ability to hold so many apps.

B0058FOB2K|3.0|I've decided to go past all the manufactured drama accompanying Miss Knowles' newest release, and instead of giving listening to the usual rumors about this album (she's a diva, she's an 'artist,' she's this and that, she's overreaching), I've decided to simply judge the album as it stands alone, because in the end it's about this album, right now, Summer 2011. So, I sat down and had a listen.<br /><br />(This review is for the Deluxe Edition, 18 songs totaling almost one hour:)<br /><br />01. 1+1 - Instead her previous mightily overproduced beginnings, she goes for the early 1990's hair-band ballad touch. It soared very simple, and I liked it - until she began to sing. It's almost laughable. I think her vocals are nothing special, but by using the Christina Aguliera's high-flying falsetto technique at the end of every line (\\"I got yooooUUUUU! ! !\\") it comes off here as desperate. For someone so independent - first coldly ditching Destiny's Child and the other members, running her own promotional empire and then helping hawk her mother's clothing through her music - she sounds here VERY much co-dependent here as well. Still, it's an interesting beginning, very ambitious. However, when she claims in the song that she \\"don't know nuthin' much about algebra\\" (nice grammar) and then says she knows \\"one plus one equals two\\" ... isn't that just basic arithmetic?<br /><br />02. I Care - I really do like the music on this album, I'm not going to lie. This is only the second track, but the songs so far have come off simple, straightforward and fascinating. Then Beyonce begins to sing, and once again she sounds so needy and almost angry. How can I believe, by her admission, that she's \\"sad and in pain\\" when she's wearing $250 jeans, sitting around in VIP seating everywhere she goes, and flying around in a G6? The lyrics are very insightful, but if maybe Jennifer Hudson had sung them, or even Fantasia, wow this would be a winner - I mean, a Grammy winner, it's so powerful - it's just not her.<br /><br />03. I Miss You - The music is keeping me going here, and it's so different, I've never heard such an ambitious project of such unique music, If this had come out as an instrumental, I'd buy it 100 times over. As it is, though, Beyonce's once again \\"kinda sad reaching out for you\\" lyrics come off as sad, and not the good kind of sad that makes you learn from it. And was it me or did I hear an 808 beat at the end of this track?<br /><br />04. Best Thing I Never Had - Whoever produced the music deserves a Grammy. Two of them. The music is honest, deep, and wow is ever worth listening to. Now I'll admit this is the closest I've come to liking this album after hearing Beyonce here. The lyrics, about a failed relationship (hmm, that sounds familiar) and how she's better off for not being with him works for me here, and for once there is a real connection between the singer and the song. Hmm, is singing hard lyrics like a growling soul singer radio-friendly again, and has it been blessed from above by St. Beyonce? This is for me the best track on the album, but once again I felt Fantasia here - a LOT. (This was the second release from the album, too bad it wasn't the first...)<br /><br />05. Party (f. Andre 3000 & Kanye West) - everytime I hear Kanye West my teeth grate, but I know he just wants the world to know he's better than Jesus, so I'll move past that for a moment. The electronic beats are great here, and the refrain \\"we like to party\\" is funny, as I think she might be a little too busy holding down a multi-million dollar business to just sit back and \\"party\\" - I just don't see it, but when Andre's wonderful soothing vocals kick in - filled with sexual innuendo, but heavily censored for the album - I'm good with it. Then Kanye's back, and the track ends so abruptly that I thought my CD was skipping or broken. Weird all the way around.<br /><br />06. Rather Die Young - I genuinely liked this track, and Teena Marie - I mean, Beyonce, vocally dances around the fuzzy guitar and she gets sexy like - dare I say it? - a female Prince, and I loved the lyrics 1000 percent. Another winning track for me, too bad it's too far and in between the other duds.<br /><br />07. Start Over - For this song, I've got only one word to describe the tone, the feeling, and the sense of what it totally is for you - Fantasia.<br /><br />08. Love On Top - El DeBarge would be proud of this wonderful remake, right down to the electronic drumbeats, the horns and vocals that seems to sound just like... (someone whispers in my ear) - oh, wait - really? Oh, ok... This TOTALLY ORIGINAL song by Beyonce is a nice fresh take on the previous 7 songs, uplifting and fun! I hope she releases this as a single, it will be an instant hit on the oldies stations, because it will fit there perfectly. Hel-l-l-l-o late 1980's!<br /><br />09. Countdown - This song has a bit of a retro feeling, the background male vocals have that Earth Wind and Fire 3 part harmony, and the electronic drums and what is very close to a xylophone are everywhere, giving the sometimes 4/4 time sometimes 8/8 beat craziness a real go for it's money, and it really works. When she goes uptempo, she goes for the stratosphere. She's killing it here.<br /><br />10. End Of Time - Shades of Gwen Stefani's \\"Hollaback Girl\\" come out here at the beginning, but immediately go into a marching order of drums, and military-style precision vocals, swirling sounds and horns that will take this song to the goal, because - she's - going - all - the - way! A seriously industrial declaration of love here. I have to say wow, as it sounds like something familiar, but how can I pinpoint it when it's everywhere? I did like this song, definitely.<br /><br />11. I Was Here - I had to prepare myself, as I not only read in the liner notes but could smell the legendary inky stamp of ballad-master and hit-maker Diane Warren here. Will Pink Floyd get upset that the beginning of this song basically rips off the echoed guitar riff from their song \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond,\\" down to the same 4 notes, strummed twice? Hmm...<br />As to the song:<br />Lyrics? Perfect, as usual. Diane did her job and Beyonce and the 4 other producers put this 4 minute track together very carefully.<br />Music? Slow and very much designed to make her fan demographic (and even new listeners like me) introspective and teary eyed. It didn't for me, though - does this mean I'm souless because I didn't bend to her lilting voice?<br />A final analysis on this one song - it's a perfectly crafted song epitaph for a self-eulogy about a woman who is just about to turn 30, yet written by another woman who is almost twice her age, about what happens after we die.<br />I really can't say anymore about that - that enough speaks volumes.<br /><br />12. Run The World (Girls) - An industrial and aggressive track that basically takes the psuedo-anger of the Spice Girls, Gwen Stefani and Pink and uses that energy to scale the wall of domination by - well, girls. The song is heavily edited - oh, no cursing here, but you better pay me for - something). This song is a dominatrix' wet dream, as her lyrics scream out such female chauvinisms as \\"you'll do anything for me\\" and especially \\"hope you still like me, if you pay me.\\" (This was the first release from the album - I can see how this song hit the charts, and within a month or so crashed down the charts.) Can you dance to it? No. Can you watch the carefully designed video over and over? Sure. Is that about it? Yes and no.<br /><br />FOR THE DELUXE EDITION:<br /><br />01 - Lay Up Under Me - I though I was hearing a slightly slowed down remix of Kylie Minogue 1988 song \\"I Should Be So Lucky,\\" but then again Beyonce, who is again channeling Jennifer Hudson's vocal style, makes it fun for me, because I'm not thinking about Beyonce once.<br /><br />02 - Schoolin Life - I liked this song, and it's a shame, because it's too little too late. Now if the whole albumhad this freshness, but... it doesn't.<br /><br />03 - Dance For You - this has got to be one of the best tracks on the second disc, and at the same time the worst - she's trying to snatch up the Britney lovers with her own slow smoky stripper song that uses every hokey line in the book. This WILL be used in every strip club from Chicago to Moscow for a long time... so, thanks for that.<br /><br />04 - Run The World (girls) (Kaskade Club remix)<br />05 - Run The World (girls) (Redtopclub remix)<br />06 - Run The World (girls) (Jochen Simms Club remix)<br /><br />Out of the three above remixes, track four wins easily. Kaskade Club has always great dance remixes, and they made this song worth listening to, finally!<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />In the end, I have to give the whole album 3 stars.<br /><br />The album is on the one hand wonderful and on the other just too uneven and too odd to categorize. Is it an eager ambitious R&B/soul/late 1980's/early 1990's pop-rock artistic experiment gone haywire, or is it someone trying too hard to be edgy and musically forward and better off sticking to the usual formula that she has tossed out to her fan demographic that has made her millions?<br /><br />I have to be fair, six songs on the album worth listening to several times: I Care, I Miss You, Best Thing I Never Had, Rather Die Young, Love On Top and Countdown. I can recommend the album based on these songs, but then... the other six songs are not very good, but they were wonderfully produced, though. It goes from okay to good to great to excellent, but Beyonce's vocals on most of them just got in the way for me.<br /><br />I mentioned two other women who, if they had this material, would have knocked it out of the park: Jennifer Hudson, who could sing the phone book for me and it would sound angelic, and Fantasia, who has had every kind of obstacle thrown in front of her from almost day one but has smashed right through it with the power of a woman who is truly talented but has always been called the \\"ghetto girl with the good voice,\\" but will always fight to show you that she's more than her past.<br /><br />Beyonce? Well, she's good and all as a professional singer, but I personally can't wholeheartedly recommend this album - half of it belongs to someone else's voice, and it isn't hers. The music is inventive if a little too retro-sounding for me (I've got enough oldies CD's at home), but still the producers (over a dozen to stir this big pot of mush) gave it a shot.<br /><br />Lastly, sorry to anyone who has bought her screensavers, her posters, her singles, her videos, her .mp3s on your Ipods and whatever else you have - although she does deliver here, and very inventive as it is, it's an only halfway done album in my opinion, and that's the real shame. Once you listen for yourself, you'll see why the initial selling price is so low on this one - it's new and different, but there's no real substance from Beyonce, no soul.<br /><br />An ernest effort layered under too much, too much, too much...<br /><br />(thanks for reading - I really welcome your comments on this review, and please don't forget to vote!)s, strummed twice?

B0052FG750|1.0|(Before you click you hated my review based on the title, please give my review a read - thanks.)<br /><br />I'm not a vindictive man by any means, but when I was handed this to review and smelled the obviousness of it, my blood ran hot. I took a long look at this very compact import box set and wondered \\"how can I review this?\\"<br /><br />If there is one thing about the six album six year long output of this incredible quartet from Long Beach, California, it's the music - it's both old and new, and with every play you always find a new gem to explore. I've been a fan of them since the late 1980's when I found original cassette copies of all of their albums. I knew that I had tapped into something wonderful and special, but I was just too young enough to remember their music when it first charted and it was played on my old AM radio of mine...<br /><br />But now it's 2011, sadly Jim Morrison has been dead 40 years this month, and this is The Doors' 8th (EIGHTH!) incarnation of \\"greatest hits/total album packaging.\\" I'm not gonna lie, I really had to step back before I wrote this review. Here's what I got, and I'm being as brief as possible.<br /><br />The sound quality is okay, it sits compact on the shelf, and that's well and good, but I've heard better (more on that later) - and all you really get here is the same CD's packaged in paper sleeves with the feel of vinyl covers for all six albums. No new music, no outtakes, no new surprises, which to some might be wonderful. It's a straightforward collection of their original albums, that's it.<br /><br />But this is all I can say about it.<br /><br />So why put another collection again, I asked myself? I gave you the reason a few seconds ago - Jim Morrison has been dead 40 years ago this month. Why else would the three remaining members (or their lawyers) agree to put out the same albums? Here's where I got upset, but I stepped back and gave this a good reasoning:<br /><br />Back in 2006 the remaining members put out the ultimate collection of all things Doors with \\"Perception,\\" which was supposed to be the end-all-be-all definitive complete album set by The Doors, with sound quality on the 6 CDs (and 6 DVD-A's on the more expensive version of the set), surpassing the older 1997, 1999, 2000 and 2003 box sets and greatest hits albums by light years! They included some newer outtakes of songs never heard before, extended cuts of songs and more, with interviews and videos and hours of watching (and listening) with sound quality from the original masters so cleaned up, remastered and crystal clear in my opinion is unsurpassed by anyone since this release.<br /><br />It was amazing, and I listened to it for hours, and it really took me back and it was wonderful. It's in my top twenty of what I'd bring if I was deserted on a desert island music albums...<br /><br />But then I came back to earth and once again I asked \\"why this little no-frills set? Why put out a set 5 years after their Mount Everest, with okay quality sound at best?\\"<br /><br />Then that nagging thought came back to me again -  Jim Morrison has been dead 40 years ago this month in 1971.<br /><br />Sadly, I had thought of yet another reason this was released...<br /><br />Greed. Plain and simple. How much money can they extract from their fans? Only Aerosmith and Bon Jovi are more obvious, blatant and greedy to retread their hits and sell you four, five (or in this case eight) different versions of greatest hits/album collections. Their lawyers must have looked at the calendar and thought \\"hmm, we can make a buck or two with this... All hail the almighty cash...\\"<br /><br />So that's it, and that's all I want to say about it without being any meaner. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE take a pass on this, because as a basic collection of The Doors albums it's nice, but they've done far far better in the past. Do yourself a massive favor and search out and find the \\"Perception\\" box set, and then drink a glass of wine (or whatever gets you to that higher plane) and relax with that.<br /><br />This set is obvious, cold and really has nothing new worth picking it up for, as any real Doors fan could see the obviousness of it a mile away as well and say \\"no thanks.\\"<br /><br />I gave this back. You should too.<br /><br />(Thanks for reading my review, and please leave any comments or votes you've got.)new worth picking it up for, as any real Doors fan could see the obviousness of it a mile away as well and say \\"no thanks.\\"    I gave this back.

B004XJHBCE|5.0|I have been using this app for a while. I love how powerful it is for organizing your apps. I am somewhat of an app collector and it helps to be able to create widgets for different groups of apps and contacts. I barely touch the tip of the iceberg with how powerful the app is, but it was still worth it to purchase!
B003UY0ZFS|5.0|Soulful, fun, peppy, romantical. I don't know a word she's saying, but you don't need to hear the words because you can hear the emotions ripping through each track.     This is one of my favorite albums, definitely great for when you need to step back and remember to enjoy the life you're living.

0316098329|3.0|A airport purchase, I was thrilled to start reading \\"Room\\". At times heartbreaking and frustrating; this novel is a valiant effort to explore the themes of child abuse in a new unique way.     The character of Jack becomes a modern day L'Enfant Sauvage while pent in a small one-room world that is defined and limited by his mother and walls. Donoghue employs a convincing childlike cadence in her narrative, allowing the reader to imagine such a sheltered life.    Though the attempt is impressionive, Donoghue fails to fully bite into the post-release psychology of the released Jack and his mother, leaving us to gather the years-long emotional fall out through a series of altercations between family members and nurses. I wished that Donoghue would have given us a glimpse into the reprecussions his capture would have had on Jack's development through adulthood. Regardless, Donoghue presents a heartbreaking fictional take on the captured child's story that has transfixed our media and minds.

1594744769|3.0|This is one of those books that immediately grabs your attention when you see it sitting there on the shelf. It just asks to be open and explored. Once you do open it, your interest is piqued even more. Flipping through its pages, you find many old-looking, curious photographs like the one on the cover. The book boards and end sheets are what looks like an old wallpaper print. The books itself is a work of art.<br />  I wish I could say the same about the story. Yes, it is original in concept, but you need more than a concept to write a great novel. I never felt involved in the story. It was almost as if so much energy was used to develop the design that there was no more left for the actual writing. The characters lacked depth. The romantic aspect (which is minor) was sort of creepy. There are many inconsistencies throughout the book (which I cannot mention without giving away a big part of the story).  I have to say the last 50-75 pages of the book were, by far, the best, so I do have hope for the sequel (which is most obviously planned).<br />  I wanted to love this book, I was disappointed that I just didn't.
B004BSFC46|4.0|i bought this wrist rattle because my 3 mo. old can't really grasp with her little fingers yet. the color is nice and they look so cute on my daughter's wrist. you can hear a tiny rattle when you shake them. its only a 4 star for me because the length of the ladybug rattle is smaller which i am afraid won't fit my baby anymore. but overall this inexpensive toy works ok. whenever i think it needs to be washed i just throw them in the washer. then its ready for next use.
B004Y1USJE|4.0|Yes has an undeniable musicianship. In this CD they definitely sound like the 70's and also, like the Drama album. Surely because of the addition of the magistral Downes.   However, the 70's sound is little too old  and dated for my ears - I love the 80's modern pop\\"ish\\" sound of yes.  So I proudly will display in my YES CD collection, and in fact, and it's better than many of the last efforts, but it isn's something I'll be listening often. Keep rocking!

B004LWZW24|1.0|Not at all good. The part with the Darth Maul look alike behind the father, had me and my friends cracking up a lot though. This movie is dumb to the extreme. The non scariness factor is amped to 11 with tired jerky camera work that seems to accompany most of the recent horror flicks, (seriously what is gonna keep people up at night about twitchy jerky camera effects and characters, the stupid non-smiling twins to instant smiling twins scene was dumb times dumb to the dumb power, featuring dumb, amplified by dumb, bathing in a vat of dumb, stirred by a dumb person with the dumb stick. Shining's encounter with slightly out of focus dead twins in an \\"empty\\" hotel vs. the insta-smile twins haha) for a laugh or a nap, dial INSIDIOUS.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|Despite the fact that it took me a few chapters to really get into the swing of this book, once I did it was very hard to put down The Snowman by Jo Nesbo. This is a complicated mystery where women who have children go missing, and either at the missing person's home or at the site of the crime scene, a snowman is found. A snowman has never seemed so ominous.    This is the first of this author's books I've read, so this is my first introduction to Harry Hole.  I like his sometimes unconventional ways of investigating and the fact that he does things pretty much the way he wants to do them even if his superiors disagree.  New detective Katrine Bratt helps Harry with the investigation, even though some of the others in the police department think she's too inexperienced.    There are many twists to the plot in The Snowman, and so many who could be suspects or who could actually be the Snowman.  The plastic surgeon has reason to be a suspect and then again, Norway has never really had a serial killer, although Harry was responsible for catching an aboriginal serial killer in Australia. The Norwegian police think that things like serial killers only exist in America.    I like the character of Harry Hole, a hard-boiled type of cop, but at the same time one with some compassion and a soft heart underneath.  He's a lonely man and throws himself into his work. The information provided about Oslo and Bergen is also nice, as well as the descriptions of winter in Norway.      Jo Nesbo's other novels that are available are now downloaded on my Kindle for future reading enjoyment.  It's always so nice to discover another author. and especially mysteries.  The Snowman is worthy of five stars because of the quality of writing and the intricate story, and for anyone who likes mysteries, suspense and thrillers, The Snowman is excellent.

We could all learn a thing or two from Jaycee!  This is a book written in her own words- almost like reading something from a little girl. I applaud  her courage for writing this book and not sugarcoating the awful things they did to her.

1594744769|5.0|I usually buy new books and sell them as soon as finishing them on amazon.com.  NOT THIS ONE! NO, this one stays in my library and will be shared with those I love.  It has been some time since I've read a book that is this engrossing, fun and well done.  I am in the business and as a writer, I find myself very jealous of this writer's talent, twists, photographic moments and story.  I wholeheartedly recommend this book with two floating thumbs up, in my own peculiar way (don't get that, that's because you haven't read it yet).  Not since Boy's Life by McCammon (my all time favorite) and The Curious Incident... have I gotten so lost in a book.  THANK YOU FOR PUBLISHING IT! THANK YOU FOR WRITING IT! THANK YOU FOR THE BEST READ THIS SUMMER!

0553801473|2.0|It must be very difficult to write 1000 pages where nothing important happens. Possibly this is why it took 5 years for MARTIN to write the book. Aside from the obvious lack of plot,internal inconsistances are everywhere One of the most obvious is Daenerys'once invincible army is now for no reason, powerless. New characters are intoduced by the dozens for no apparent purpose other then filling pages. Old characters you do care about are ignored or killed off,again for no apparent reason other then filling up pages.<br /><br />Every book even those in a series should stand on its own, this book does not rise to that level. It is filler plain and simple, often well written but filler nonetheles.<br /><br />All and all a disservice to his many readers
1582701709|3.0|I like the concept, but this book sounds from the get-go like it's trying to sell you something, which it is...this BOOK! It can be summed up like this, ASK the universe for something you want, BELIEVE it will be given to you, then simply RECEIVE it. That's it! You don't need to buy the book. But, the supposed experts talk alot about getting rich and losing weight. Just the things gullible people want to hear about.<br /><br />I want to know how it came to be that this works, but the author doesn't think we need to be concerned about that. It just works, that's it.<br /><br />We have basically created our own reality by the sum of our thoughts. Well, fine, but what about children? What about when terrible, horrific things happen to them? Did they create that existence or experience because they were all nervous, pessimistic children? I don't think so. Did they absorb the karma from their parents? Just doesn't add up.<br /><br />And what about this weight thing? If we think 'thin', then we will be 'thin'...doesn't matter what we eat. Yeah, ok. What about anorexic people? They think 'fat' and they are skinny as hell! Also, doesn't add up.<br /><br />The author claims that this 'Law' of Attraction is infallible - no exceptions. Well, I just gave you two.<br /><br />Here's the answer...look deep within yourself by meditating, doing yoga, doing deep breating exercises, journaling, asking yourself questions like, 'What do I truly want and need to be happy?' and wait for a response, although it might take some time. You already have the answer buried within the core of your being. It's there. Once you know, begin making healthier choices. Recognize the habits you created for yourself and start catching them a little bit faster every time. Don't wallow in self-pity or shame. Do what you need to do (step-by-step) to live a healthier, happier life...no exceptions.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|The fifth installment of \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" was just a little less disappointing than the fourth.  Too much time was spent on tedium while important story arcs and characters were either underdeveloped or ignored entirely.  All that being said, I did enjoy this book, and I am anxiously awaiting the next installment (though I hope it doesn't take five years to arrive).  I would still recommend this to others as there are some great scenes (Drogon and Dany at the pits, for one) and important story developments (ie: the return of a certain prince).  But don't expect this one to rival any of the first three books.

B003MC5N28|5.0|You know a book is worth reading when it sticks with you for nearly 20 years. I read this when it first came out...I was 10 years old. Through the years this story stuck with me, always in my mind and evoking a somewhat melancholy feeling. For years I searched for it, but could never remember its name or specific enough details to find it.     After reading 'Brave New World', at a friend's suggestion, the similarities inspired me to search again and here it is! This story profoundly affected me as a child and comes back to me often in my international work.    I highly recommend this book to adults and mature children alike.

0312600844|3.0|This NYT bestseller documents the lives of three college students who manage to drift towards each other without any sincere intentions. For several decades their lives continue to intersect through one mid-life crisis after another. Walter and Patty Berglund and Walter's roommate, Richard, avoid living life by creating distractions of self-imposed relevance. As a result, the storyline travels from one crisis to the next with few happy spots - except maybe an orgasm or two - in between. Like Franzen's last novel, The Corrections, Freedom is a study in the flaws of human nature; every dirty, nasty little detail of it.  Franzen's prose is a fluid, easy read with deep characterization though little plot. More than 150 pages of the first half of the book is an \\"autobiography\\" Patty wrote at the request of her therapist. The second half of the book is dominated by \\"issues\\" including the environmental impact of mountain top coal removal and overpopulation. Both seem to be just another distraction, this time for the reader, from what is really going on in the psyche of the characters.  Franzen's writing is brilliant in its artistic language, but I think he suffers from an attention deficit disorder. In the April 18, 2011 issue of The New Yorker, is Franzen's essay \\"Farther Away\\" about his escape to the island Alejandro Selkirk - indigenously referred to as \\"Farther Away\\" - in the South Pacific Ocean. The island is believed to be where Alexander Selkirk, the Scottish adventurer, lived alone and \\"was probably the basis for Daniel Defoe's novel Robinson Crusoe\\". The article references Robinson Crusoe extensively, but the article is also about Franzen being burned out after promoting Freedom, and it's about Franzen's friend David Foster Wallace, and it's about Franzen's hopes of spotting a rare, endangered species of bird on the island, all of which is tied together by a thin vein of individualism (sigh). Alas, much like Freedom, I know I read something of substance, I'm justtoo tired to figure out what.

0307593495|2.0|I was excited about reading the last of the Wallander series books.  This excitement quickly turned to disappointment.  I think that Mr. Mankell took the easy way out assigning Wallander to an old age with Alzheimer's.  He obviously wanted to end the series and what an unoriginal way to do it.  The symptoms didn't really even seem to coincide with reality as the people I've known with Alzheimer's haven't exhibited memory loss in that way.<br /><br />His anti-American sentiments have gotten old.  American readers have helped make him a wealthy man.  While he's entitled to his political opinions, they are certainly far from inspired.<br /><br />I will miss Wallander- but not THIS Wallander.  I'll miss the Wallander of old.  The young, troubled, but thought provoking Wallander.  I had hoped that Mankell in Wallander would someday equal Colin Dexter's accomplishements with Inspector Morse, albeit with a Swedish twist, but I'm afraid he has fallen far short of that mark.

B0034G4ORC|4.0|It's widely considered that the 10 Freeway is a diabolical freeway, and that's even before the nasty extraterrestrials took it over and laid down overwhelming gunfire on our Marines. BATTLE: LOS ANGELES sure was panned by critics and moviegoers, and you can blame that on the derivative story, the predictable characters, and the cliched dialogue. Except that there are certain shady films for which I'll readily chloroform my inner critic. To me - a sci-fi, apocalyptic, war of the worlds fiend - BATTLE: LOS ANGELES is sheer escapism. I savored the stuff it did right and was magnanimous towards its deficiencies.<br /><br />Fifteen or so minutes into it, the film plants you in the middle of the global alien invasion - or, rather, the part of it having to do with Los Angeles. There's set-up concerning the media breaking news about clusters of meteors hurtling toward the planet, but we all recognize these for what they are, especially once the military briefer lets out that these meteors are slowing down right before impact. World-weary Marine Staff Sergeant Michael Nantz (Aaron Eckhart) had put in his twenty years and he's ready to call it quits. But there's something so inconveniencing about an extraterrestrial attack. Staff Sergeant Nantz gets tapped for one more mission, never mind that his last one had left him with a shaky reputation. BATTLE: LOS ANGELES charts a day in the life of a platoon of U.S. Marines -  to which Staff Sgt. Nantz is assigned - as they deploy to Santa Monica to evacuate civilians. The caveat is that the platoon has a deadline to do this as the bombs will drop in three hours' time.<br /><br />In the meantime, Nantz finds himself having to support a newly minted lieutenant who's never seen battle, as well as facing the skepticism of his grunts. Aaron Eckhart is our point of view character and his strong performance gives the movie its much needed grounding. And you can always rely on Michelle Rodriguez - who's solid at playing those tough girl parts - to lend some action hero creds to her Air Force tech specialist.<br /><br />The film benefits from its gritty documentary-style presentation, and there's an intensity and a visceral vibe to the combat engagements which impressed me, which recall those harrowing opening moments in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. These aliens - bipedal arthropod creatures with chitinous exoskeletons  - wield superior firepower which include laser arrays and aerial attack drones which effortlessly take out our own aerial forces. The aliens' weaponry make our artillery as effective as half-hearted wedgies.<br /><br />Los Angeles is leveled, and when I say \\"Los Angeles,\\" I, of course, mean Santa Monica, which is another city altogether. And when I Say \\"Santa Monica,\\" I mean the cities of Shreveport and Baton Rouge, Louisiana which are masquerading as Los Angeles (or Santa Monica). Whatever. The cityscape is devastated, and one wishes that there were more emotion invested into that. Except that the alien threat isn't articulated all that well. And with the big bad coming off so nebulous, it's left to our Marines to provide dramatic conflict, as if we're not privy enough to speeches about honor and survival's guilt and Ooorah!-all-the-live-long-day.<br /><br />I won't go into the film's superficial stock characters because there are hardly any stand-outs and most of them die anyway, with me reacting with a shrug to each death. Sue me, the story did not make me care about anyone except for Eckhart's character, and possibly Michelle Rodriguez's and Ram&oacute;n Rodr&iacute;guez's characters (Rodr&iacute;guez plays the raw lieutenant). I'm in it for the special effects - which are top notch - and for the wicked combat scenes. I did like one savage sequence in which the platoon hauled in a wounded alien and tried to find out its weakness. It's an ugly moment because Sgt. Nantz had to basically torture the alien to determine its Achilles' heel. But, in wartime, this is an absolutely critical and practical move. So there's a bit of ugly reality for you. BATTLE: LOS ANGELES isn't as epic as INDEPENDENCE DAY but neither is it as bloody awful as SKYLINE. All in all, 3.5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Shhh. I think my inner critic is waking up.tical move.

1594744769|4.0|I was of course fascinated with the pictures this book contains as well and a little hesitant on what the story would bring. I was ecstatic when I finally got the physical copy in my hands. Realizing how well this book is actually made I was highly recommending to all my friends to buy the physical book instead of the kindle or audio versions because of how well this book is made. Under the cover (which fits the book tightly and does not slide off!) the cover is cloth with Miss Peregrine's signature on the cover, the side is made to look like a fancy old fashioned cloth made book. And what I personally enjoyed the most was that the book looks sewn together instead of glued, and you get several of these awesomely freaky pictures throughout.<br />After immensely enjoying reading the story I decided on a whim to check out the audio while at work one day and found that to be a mistake (maybe in my boss' eyes) because little did I know that I would become so involved in listening to the audio I slacked on my work =0 The narrator did a fantastic job.<br />The story did not freak me out as much as I thought it might and had some surprising twists in it that I never expected (like time travel) and some I did like creepy kids that have paranormal gifts.<br />It all starts with Jacob's grandpa Porter telling stories of his youth in the orphanage that housed peculiar children. They were watched over by the \\"old bird\\" from the dangerous monsters \\"awful hunched-over ones with rotting skin and black eyes.\\" He would show Jacob photos of the peculiar children who could lift boulders, hover, had mouths in the back of their heads and several more. Grandpa would also get a little scary with his stories, that he would have to fight the monsters and in his old age became very paranoid and dies suddenly and tragically one day. Jacob has trouble dealing with what he saw in the woods after he found his grandfather and he himself has trouble coping. Jacob has to find the answers to his grandfathers life, and his death. Only the orphanage can hold the answers Jacob seeks.<br />With the intermittent photos throughout the book, it turned out to be a very fast read for me. It was entertaining and surprising. I found myself staring at the photos longer than it took me to read the pages *very fascinating!. It was one of the  most entertaining books I have read this year. A murder mystery with time travel and a little romance? Yes Please!<br />If you have not seen the trailer for the book I posted earlier today, I highly recommend it.<br />I have not checked out an ebook copy yet, but you cannot go wrong with the physical copy or the audio in my opinion.e, and his death.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|DISCLAIMER: I did not give Wicked five stars because I think it is a good prequel to The Wizard of Oz, in fact,There is NO support for Wicked in the MGM film which because of the green skin, ruby slippers, and the Scarcrow's costume at the end, it is a prequel to. The Wicked Witch of the West in the film is a Psychopath (person with no emotions whatsoever) at best, if not just plain evil. If The Wicked Witch of the West were taken to trial on charges including, truspassing, bribery, false inprisionment and attempted murder, Wicked would be the case presented by the defense, and, no matter how unfounded it is, would be a good case.      That being said Wicked DOES something good for people. It makes them accept a person like Hitler or Osama Bin Laden as a person, not a monster. Olny Oz can work that type of magic on a person's hearts, therefore, Oz is a good miedum for to make a story like this accseptible after 9/11, and with the show coming to New York so soon after the second anniversery of 9/11 (October 30, 2003) it has had AMAZING succes, considering that fact. My hope is that Wicked will help people give the same good faith given to The Wicked Witch of the West in Wicked to people like Hitler or Osama Bin Laden, olny then will we be able to achieve World Peace, and the BEST part will be, it will be because of the creation of a land called Oz!

The cool thing about this is it shows a clear growth and evolution of the band while still maintaining their unique sound and ability to write great songs. Things get started with the title track, a high energy hurricane of pounding guitar riffs and effects that deliver with a sonic boom. \\"When You're Young\\" has a catchy melody with strong vocal hooks that draw you right in. \\"Round and Round\\" is a blend of guitars and bass that features Matt Roberts absolutely shredding the guitar. \\"Back To Me\\" is a power ballad that showcases Arnold's talents as a singer. He sings some amazing melodies that only a few people could pull off, and the result is pure bliss.

0307408833|3.0|Sugar free? Well, I guess agave isn't white sugar, but anything with over a cup of agave in it (which is often highly processed) is probably not considered sugar free in the conventional sense. By sugar-free, I think of dates, applesauce, and other sweet whole foods.     Yes, there are gluten free recipes. However, many of them have spelt--many of the really important ones, that is. Sure, a pie filling may be gluten free, but if the crust isn't, the book isn't much good to me. I can find a filling recipe anywhere--the crust is what is tricky. The pie chapter, for example, is 12 pages long, and only has 5 recipes, only 1 of which is gluten free, and it requires buying store made ice cream as the filling.     Some nice points: photos of everything, and a lack of shortening/margarine. The icing is a little heavy on the soy taste, but the cocoa helps mask that. I could do without the lengthy recipe introductions on each page, celebrity plugs, lots of white space, and anecdotes--I'd rather see the pages filled with more recipes.     This cookbook is good for those new to wheat- and animal-free baking, who have access to expensive, difficult-to-find ingredients, and want to make a decent dessert.
0553801473|3.0|GRRM's latest installment of his sprawling, epic series A Song of Ice and Fire (ASOIAF), A Dance with Dragons (ADWD) demonstrated some progress in Martin's and his editors' process if not the plot of the series.  The last book, A Feast for Crows (AFFC) brought the entire series to a grinding halt, with the primary characters and plotlines of the first 3 books being swept aside for a peek into the other side of the struggle for power in Westeros and painfully, didactically depicted travel sequences.  ADWD brings us back to the stories and struggles of the characters for whom fans developed positive regard over the first 3 books.  For the first 500 pages of the book, we are given spots of improved editing, most notably during the travel sequences.  In AFFC, pages upon pages upon chapters upon chunks of the book are spent describing not the trials and travails of traveling in a Medieval world, but the monotony of it.  In ADWD, while there is still much traveling, we are spared from the drawn out, painstaking detail of the day-to-day accounts of quests that, we readers know, are dead on the vine.  There are a dozen instances of GRRM consolidating his travel diaries, into single lines or paragraphs (i.e. \\"...the ship sat bestilled for a fortnight...\\") which greatly enhanced the reading experience.  AFFC felt like a genuine chore to get through at times, ADWD never does.<br /><br />The first 500 pages of ADWD are dynamite; quick moving, informative exposition, new twists on the histories and mythology of ASOFAI and potentially intriguing character combinations.  After reading each character's first chapter, I was genuinely excited to see some of their plans come to fruition: I was looking forward to seeing Tyrion join Dany's council, to see Dany master her dragons and solve the Meereen issue with cunning and fire and blood, to see Jon learn more of his identity and begin his war with the Others, to see Bran master his gift and exert his influence on the game of thrones and to see Stannis meet the Boltons in the field.  Of course in GRRM's brutal world, the best laid plans get thrown to waste by everything from evil to treachery to the forces of fate to weather.  Yes, weather greatly exerts it's influence in Westeros and the Narrow Sea and apparently it's goals are to delay, obfuscate and distract.  No plan mentioned above comes to fruition, which is often the case in fantasy novels, but what's alarming is where these disturbances bring us.<br /><br />Instead of taking the original idea and turning it on its head to create a new, better scenario, GRRM's plot twists leave the characters mired in infuriatingly uninteresting predicaments.  From a ship sitting in the sea to an army being halted by snows, GRRM shatters convention of the Fantasy genre be injecting reality.  While this device is how GRRM made his bones and worked with great effect when dealing with the politics of Westeros (i.e. Ned acting honorably in an unjust world was his very doom), one can't help but feel as if he's gone to the well one too many times.  Readers want to see battles, want to see scheming and intrigue, want a taste of the supernatural, want to see a character work his way out of impossible odds or die trying. They don't want to see these potential outcomes averted due to \\"reality,\\" yet more often than not, that is what we get.  The potentialities established at the beginning of the book are systematically put to death as the story \\"moves,\\" and the book suffers for it.<br /><br />GRRM has many literary idiosyncrasies, and they are present in all their splendor here.  Painstakingly detailed descriptions of every meal, every character eats, every time they eat? Check.  Superfluous wardrobe description?  Check.  Having notable and exciting events occur \\"off screen?\\"  Check.  Introduction of new characters/questions/plotlines before any of the old are addressed?  Check.  Glacial plot development?  Check.  Lack of character growth despite their life experience?  Check.  Cliffhangers upon cliffhanger upon cliffhangers?  Check.<br /><br />Not all applications of the above devices are negative, but they speak to a fundamental flaw in Martin's approach to this series: there is no acknowledgment or acceptance of his readers' learning curve and acquired knowledge with regard to GRRM's \\"world.\\".  What I mean by that, is that we are now on the 5th book of this series.  Anyone who is reading this book has read the previous 4.  This is not a universe that can abide stand-alone books a la Warhammer, where readers are coming from vastly differing levels of exposure.  GRRM has worked hard to teach us the ethos,zeitgeist, mythology and norms of this world and readers have worked hard and invested much time in learning it.  Yet, Martin continues to clog the pages with atmosphere and it comes at the cost of the story's development and momentum.  I do not need to know every meal (I felt palpable relief when finally he described a character as only eating \\"a simple dinner\\"- this only happens once in the book), every outfit, every tedious, repeated environmental description (Meereen has many colored bricks?  You don't say!) shoved down my throat in every chapter.  If a reader doesn't have the \\"feel\\" of this universe by now, I'm afraid that they never will.  The prime drawback of this element is that the book builds to the various conflicts and resolutions of its plotlines, then just runs out of space.  It just stops.  Without a single resolution.  For a book that comes in at 959 pages to run out of space is a symptom of an egregious problem.<br /><br />****Spoiler alert***<br /><br />When you combine the issues of Martin's idiosyncrasies, interruption of missions, and injections of reality, here are the developments that we get over the last 3 books (approximately 3,000 pages):<br /><br />-Tyrion has escaped Westeros, ends up with the long-lost Prince Aegon (Rhaegar's son) on his way to join with Dany (oh, how forward I was looking to seeTyrion offering his one-of-a-kind wisdom to Dany, or at least Aegon) only to end up in captivity, then a slave, then a sellsword accountant, none resulting in any really interesting outcomes.  How much better would the story have been if Tyrion had been in Meereen for the majority of the book advising Dany and Selmy and dealing with Reznak and Daario?  Sigh.<br /><br />- Dany, now marooned in Meereen (Meereened?) is dealing with enemies on all sides, 3 growing dragons and no less than 5 men racing for her hand in marriage.  In Dany's first 5 chapters, Martin does a masterful job of building a seething, threatening atmosphere- a city on the brink of fire and blood, then proceeds to take the most uninteresting approaches to dealing with the various threats.  At the beginning of the book, I expected Dany to be moving on to Westeros on top of a dragon, the only question whether she went after a victory or defeat.  By the end of the book, Meereen is left much the way it started- in turmoil and on the brink of conflict.  Martin even shows the first step of the battle, as he leaves us to wither until the next book.  The total development of the Meereen situation and Dany's disposition in the entire book could have occurred within 3 chapters.<br /><br />- Jon Snow has introduced Welfare to the Wall and taken in the entire wildling population of Westeros.  Much like Dany, he refuses to leave even a single person to suffer or die, even those who seem beyond hope.  While the reasoning for joining with the free folk is sound (anyone south of the Wall is either an extra sword, or one less wight that he'll have to face later), Jon's maturity and development doesn't come across in his actions as much as one would expect.  His treatment of Hardhome seems forced by blind idealism and his rushing to confront the Bastard of Bolton seems to come out of left field.  Why would he leave the Wall immediately after implementing a radical policy change which has left the Watch more vulnerable than ever?  It just doesn't add up.  Oh, and he's been Caesared by his staunchly conservative brothers, though I have a hunch that his death is more Brienne than Ned.  I can't help but feel that Jon's and Dany' plotlines are running counterpoint to each other and are leading to a climactic dovetail.  Hopefully this occurs before book 114.<br /><br />-Bran finally arrives to the 3 eyed crow, who turns out to be a Child of the Forest and learns that he is to become a greenseer.  We only get 3 chapters of his travel and training and again, out of all the ways that this could have been handled, Martin chose the least interesting option....for now.<br /><br />-It took 2 full books for the Ironborn to simply get in the general vicinity of Meereen.  I expected to see them fight or join with Dany at the end of AFFC, yet here we are, a full book later, and all we get is a mere restating of their goals.  The addition of Moquorro could be interesting, but again- the amount of movement which this added plot has undergone in ADWD is simply unacceptable.<br /><br />- In what was likely the highlight of the book, we now know what became of Theon Greyjoy.  Tortured and subjugated by Ramsay Bolton, Theon (now known as Reek)gives us our eyes and ears in the Bolton camp.  The way that Martin has transformed Theon was brilliant, and he's been placed to have a major impact on the outcome of the North.  Of course, in keeping with tradition, Reek's chapters build towards the conflict between the Boltons and Stannis, the climax of which occurs offscreen.  However, the Bastard of Bolton's letter to Snow at the end was incredible- it gave me goosebumps.<br /><br />- We were given a few new characters and plotlines, including the huge development that Prince Aegon lives (made more remarkable by the implications this has on Jon Snow's identity).  After heeding Tyrion's advice, Aegon does what Dany was unable to and secures an army and passage to Westeros.  I like this idea very much and unlike the other plotlines, Martin kicks this one up with a quickness.  It was refreshing to see that Jon Connington and Aegon secured the services of the Golden Company, made their way to Westeros, revealed Aegon's identity and immediately obtained a foothold through quick and stealthy strikes.  All in 2 chapters.  We need more like this George- if you can do this for characters who don't know intimately, it's time to increase the actions and progress of those we do.<br /><br />Ok- this ended up way longer than I anticipated- to anyone who has actually read this much, thank you so much.  I'd love to chat with you all in the comments section.  Finally, below I'll list the amount of chapters per character, something that I saw a reviewer do for AFFC and found it interesting- hopefully you do as well.<br /><br />Tyrion: 11<br />Dany: 10<br />Jon: 12<br />Bran: 3<br />Quentyn: 4<br />Davos: 4<br />Reek (Theon): 7<br />Griff (Connington):2<br />Asha: 3<br />Melisandre: 1<br />Areo: 1<br />Arya: 2<br />Jaime: 1<br />Cersei: 2<br />Barristan: 4<br />Victarion: 2
B00533D3CQ|5.0|'Ninth' is my introduction to Peter Murphy. I discovered this album by complete chance by stumbling upon his official website. It so happened that was the day the music video for `I Spit Roses' hit the internet, lucky me. One viewing of the video and I was hooked and immediately bought this album via Amazon Mp3. Usually it takes me a little while to really enjoy an album but `Ninth' hit me pretty hard on the first listen.  I do enjoy the raw quality of the music and I feel this particular aspect is worth noting. Often raw sounding albums are either hit or miss and `Ninth' is a hit. All the songs are enjoyable, some more than others.  The highlights for me on the album are `Velocity Bird', `Memory Go', `Slowdown', `The Prince & Old Lady Shade', and of course `I Spit Roses'. That's not to say there are any fillers. All the songs on `Ninth' are very solid, well comprised pieces of music. As a first time listener to Peter Murphy, I have to say `Ninth' has me interested in delving further into his catalogue. Very happy with my chance finding of this album and have already recommended it to a few friends.
0071752854|5.0|If you've ever come out of a meeting, conversation, or sales appointment with a \\"no\\", or \\"unfavorable\\" response from your audience or prospect AND didn't know why, then you may want to check out this book.  In a fun, readable format, this book breaks down the psychological processes everyone uses to evaluate whether or not they will get involved with a deal that you are presenting.  Providing examples of how to plan, how to think and how to speak in a pitch, Klaff guides you through how to move from relying on a mentality like \\"I hope they will invest with us...\\" to powerful frames of reference, removing chance from the equation and stacking the deck in your  favor --- all the while allowing the prospect or your audience to make a strong affirmative decision on their own, and feel like it's their decision.  Imagine having your prospects chasing YOU rather than you chasing them = that is the purpose of Klaff's book.    Having been in real estate and raised money for large projects, I've been in front of many investors and won some and lost some.  After just a couple of months of following Klaff's approach I've already had stronger results than before by taking the guesswork and hoping out of my presentations and conversations.    Great book, thanks Oren!
0553381695|5.0|Often, when reviewing epic fantasy, or reading reviews of epic fantasy, you are faced with a dilemma: do you believe the fan who will worship the author's grocery list if presented in manuscript form or do you believe the naysayer who fails to accept that other points of view prevail. That being said, I'll try to present a review of this title with as little bias as possible.     If you read my review of \\"A Game of Thrones,\\" you'll note that many of the PROs and CONs have remained the same, however, I have one key difference to point out. Whereas in \\"A Game of Thrones\\" I was encouraged by the character development of Martin yet turned off by the lack a creative world, I now feel that with \\"A Clash of Kings\\" Martin's true style takes hold. In this respect, \\"A Clash of Kings\\" was important for me in that it did three main things:    -It further characterized the story as character-based while moving deeper into the emotions of the characters  -It moved the plotline along to a more cutthroat style of political warfare, giving more legitimacy to Martin's creativity than with \\"A Game of Thrones\\" and, thus, making this book more enjoyable than its predecessor  -It continued the trend of unpredictability, with Martin being entirely capable of killing off your favorite character.    With that being said, \\"A Clash of Kings\\" was, for me, a definite improvement over \\"A Game of Thrones\\" for the reasons listed above. I felt that the storyline was more suspense-driven, intrigue-filled, and unpredictable. The characters really came into their own and they touch you as a reader. If \\"A Game of Thrones\\" was an introductory foray into a world that I viewed somewhat lacking in creativity, it is \\"A Clash of Kings\\" that fully reveals what Martin has to offer, and hopefully continues, with this franchise.      PROS:    -PROSE- Martin's writing, again, is masterful; his prose is easy to read, coherent, and is not shy with regard to expressing emotions or actions on behalf of the characters.    -CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT- this book, indeed this series, is driven by individual character development, with no character, really, being either completely black or white but grey. Martin's mastery comes at developing these characters as individual entities all shaping a powerful plotline. All of the characters are powerful in their own right, with wily natures and strengths and weaknesses. One review I read faulted Martin for not establishing female characters of a power with their male counterparts. I find this not a problem in the series, particularly in this book, as Arya, Sansa, Catelyn, and Cersai all have their own strengths, weaknesses, intrigue, and ability to affect events just as the males do, yet theres is a more indirect power in some circumstances as a result of the medieval environment.    -INTRIGUE- It is with \\"A Clash of Kings\\" that the powerful intrigue and political scheming revolving around the Iron Throne really takes form and engages the reader's interest.    -CHARACTER VULNERABILITY- Martin is unafraid to kill characters off, even ones that you may love. This is viewed as a positive, for me, as I grow tired of books that result in one character defeating all odds unscathed. Martin does not kill his series in this respect, as he has built up many characters that are able to take the place of those important ones lost.    CONS:    -GRAPHIC NATURE- I personally didn't mind the graphic nature of this book as Martin strove to be realistic in the confines of the medieval setting he painted. Be warned, however, for it is filled with sex, incest, and violence.    -JOYLESS- This series is filled with defeat after defeat for those characters you grow to love, regardless of what faction they support. While this does lend realism to the story, some readers will be turned off by the lack of good versus evil and the absence of any real lasting victory for the characters.      All-in-all, this is a refreshing work in the fantasy genre that improved upon its predecessor. Indeed, this is rare, but I believe in this case it is true. However, be cautioned that no one can truly dictate what form of fantasy you'd enjoy, as this book is not for everyone. I only hope that by listing some of the strengths and weaknesses of the book I could be of help. If you enjoyed the first in the series, you will enjoy this book; if you did not, then continuing the series may not be of best interest to you.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|This was such an exciting series, so much foreshadowing, hints of plots to come, intrigues to play out. The problem is that none of it ever happens. This author has no plan. He just writes very well but I don't think he even remember book one. Tolkien he's not. Too bad.
B0000A5BT1|1.0|Will not play.
1400079144|3.0|I finally got around to reading this recently.  Based on all the bad reviews it received, I wasn't in a rush to get to it.   The truth is that its not a bad book.  I found it pretty entertaining and not deserving of the overly harsh reviews its getting.  Honestly, I really don't understand the avalanche of 1 and 2 star reviews.  It's sort of bizarre.
1593351941|1.0|I bought this and wish I hadn't. I looked at the reviews and no one was specific about which version it was. I will tell you, this is NOT the 1818 version - don't bother wasting your money!
B0000252YZ|5.0|AND ALL I KNOW IS THE GUITAR DRUMS AND THE WHOLE BAND ROCK.MAYBE THE SONG WRITING ISNT AS GREAT AS THE FIRST 2 ALBUMS BUT DAMN WELL PRETTY CLOSE.WHEN WYLDE CAME INTO THE BAND I LOST INTREST IN OZZY.BUT ALL OF OZZYS DRUMMERS ARE DAMN AWESOME.
0345529057|2.0|First, these books are very explicit.  The violence and brutality and sex are described in excruciating detail.  And the sex is often rape, incest, or pedophelia, or all three at once.  Some of this is necessary, I suppose, to help the reader understand the brutality of the world Martin envisions, but it was entirely too much for my taste.     These books are well written, in the sense that they convey a very detailed picture of the fantasy world the author has created.  The author's use of the English language is superb in describing the lives and the trials of the many characters he brings to life in this series.  The world Martin creates is vivid and very imagnitive.  There are only a few logical flaws and the stories are full of twists and even a few surprises.  But ultimately the central message of the books is their downfall.      The central message of these books is:  If you trust in people you will be betrayed.  Any character in any of these books who displays any humane ideal; such as compassion, honor, empathy, kindness, or even mercy, is eventually betrayed.  And usually they are savagely and brutally mudered.  The author is very consistent about this.  There are no exceptions to this rule.  In every one of these books from start to finish, all humane actions are invariably repaid with most savage brutality imaginable.  And the author goes to great lengths to point out that the characters who displayed kindness/compassion/honor/mercy were fools for doing so, usually by having the other characters laugh at them after they have betrayed and savagely murdered them.      But the author is not satisfied with simply betraying and mudering any character who displays any sort of kindness.  No, he goes much further.  He arranges the story so that the characters who displayed some sort of kindness are eventually portrayed to the public (in this case Martin calls them the small folk) as someone vile and evil who deserved to be betrayed and murdered by the very people who betrayed and murdered them.         This is an incredibly bleak and depressing message. And, I have to believe, a false message.  Nonetheless, it is the central message of this book series.    So for my rating I start with 5 stars for the very high quality of the writing in general.  Then I subtract 1 star for the unnecessarily explicit sex/incest/pedophelia content.  Then I subtract 2 stars for the bleak and false message the books convey at their core.  That leaves 2 stars, which is my final review.
B0051MKNV8|5.0|The premise is simple but intriguing, what if you had the ability to unlock the full potential of your mind? That is what Eddie Morra (played by Bradley Cooper) is presented with when his drug dealing ex brother in law hands him a pill to help him with his failing life. Feeling he has nothing to lose Eddie tries the pill and finds it works beyond his wildest imagination. Now armed with what he describes as \\"Limitless\\" capabilities to learn and use knowledge, Eddie quickly finds he effortlessly is able to navigate up the social-economic ladder. But the pill comes with side effects, as do most drugs, which threaten to not only derail his success but end his life.    Every aspect of Limitless is interesting and creative. The director, Neil Burger, makes bold choices in camera angles and lightening that really draw the audience into the world of the lead character. The story follows a logical build up of its plot without holes or requiring the audience to take a giant leap of faith of plausibility. The casting was spot on, particularly Robert De Niro, who plays a heartless business tycoon. De Niro is at his very best in his supporting role. Bradley Cooper has a breakout performance as he capably shifts from your average uninspired burnout writer, to a man who has the world in the palm of his hand, to a drug addicted addict suffering from paranoia. It's a tough role and Cooper makes it seem effortless.    The entire concept is thought provoking and Limitless treats it's concept well. The movie kept me guessing what may happen next the whole way through and the twists at its conclusion are great. There is really nothing not to like in this movie and I give it my highest recommendation. Limitless is the best movie of the year to date.
B000FCKPHG|3.0|A relative swore this book changed his life. Naturally, I had to read it. Didn't quite have the same effect on me. It did however elighten me on a slant of psychology I never paid much attention to, or rather, have never thought of before. I did take some benefit out of it. One major drawback is that it didn't spend enough time teaching you how to change your mindset, but rather gave plenty of examples od those that have different mindsets.<br /><br />In all, it's a decent read if you are frustrated in life and want a means to correct it. Great for parents raising kids, bosses, and anyone in a leadership position.
B004Y1USJE|5.0|I have listened to yes for decades and been through all of the lineups and different albums. I have everyone in my collection. I must admit I was uncertain what to expect from a new yes album without Jon Anderson. As yes fans we have only experienced that on one other Album Drama. But when I put it on I was pleasantly surprised but what I found to be an amazing new cd from Yes. Powerful Songs and great sounds. Steve Howe really shines on this one and David Benoit does a great job of filling the shoes of Jon Anderson. I know there is a lot of controversy about the band going on without John Anderson and a lot of people where already predisposed to not like this cd. My advice would be to just listen with open ears and you will be pleasantly surprised by a great new cd! Here's hoping for many more new albums from Yes. The future looks bright indeed. Pick this one up and add it to you collection today.
159448385X|5.0|I purchased A Thousand Splendid Suns for my sister through Amazon because, price-wise, it was a bargain considering store prices -- even with postage . Although it is a used book, it is in superb condition. My sister started leisurely reading it on June 26th and finished on July 10th. Needless to say she was very happy with the condition of the book and of course, the novel.

B004XJHBCE|5.0|I've been using this app for a little over a year.  It does exactly what it should.  Some of the ways I use it:    * Starred Apps Folder in dock (using any other launcher you can place a Folder Organizer shortcut in the dock)  * Contacts Folder - Pops up a folder with all of my contacts with their picture (hit the star at top to just bring up your starred contacts) Hit a contact and the quick contact dialog pops up asking if you want to call, email, text, or navigate to this contact.  For all of the 1 stars shouting iPhone clone, show me how to do this with an iPhone that isn't jailbroken.      Apps can live in more than one folder, and folders can have mixed content Shortcuts, contacts and apps can all be in the same folder.      I've never noticed any slow down, runs great on my Nexus S and Xoom.
B000SFJWLU|5.0|Very impressed with this freshman disc from 5FDP.  Heard 'The Bleeding' and decided to purchase the album the day it came out and didn't regret it for one second. In all honesty I was suprised how great the album was so I decided to see them live and they were AWESOME.  Great catchy hard rock/metal to get the blood pumping.  There's a lot of talent in this band and I hope to see many great albums in the future.
B005BW14FC|4.0|I grew up with 3 Doors Down. Kryptonite was my anthem when it came out and I was like 10 years old. As I grew up, I watched them grow musically. Now we have Time Of My Life. Does 3 Doors Down still have it after over 10 years? HECK YEAH!! It's the 3 Doors Down we all have come to know and love, but seems like they've added a VERY SLIGHT pop edge to their signature grunge/southern metal sound. But it doesn't sound bad at all. It actually sounds great! If you've been a fan for years or are just getting into them, I highly recomend this album. The best hard rock/grunge album of 2011. Hands down.
055357342X|5.0|In Storm of Swords, Martin takes the action, intrigue, and gut punches from the first two books in his grand epic A Song of Ice and Fire and cranks them up to 11.  As the book opens, war continues to rage on in the Riverlands, a massive invasion of Wildlings has begun to move toward the Wall, and Daenerys is about to embark on a spree of conquest on the continent of Essos.<br /><br />Martin keeps the suspense taut and is not afraid to drive the knife in deep and twist.  A Storm of Swords includes a scene sure to invoke as visceral reaction from the reader as anything in the first three books.  Unexpected deaths and plot twists are never in short supply.<br /><br />Martin maintains the readable and workmanlike prose of the first two books and displays an impressive medieval vocabulary.  There is a great deal of mundane exposition, but Martin skillfully uses it to drive the foreshadowing and suspense.<br /><br />A Storm of Swords is easily, in my mind, the best of the first five novels in the series.  It also marks the conclusion or at least winding down of many of the large story arcs set up in the first novel.  After A Storm of Swords the series begins to concentrate more on what might be dubbed the \\"real\\" story.  It also marks the inflection point between set-up novels designed to establish the series and to have the strength to stand on their own to transition novels devoted to characterization and shuffling pieces around on the board in preparation for the grand climax.
B0052VUNHC|1.0|I'm kind of unsettled to find that I seem to be the first reviewer who found this book profoundly disturbing.    The heroine is in ludicrous situations created by flimsy plot devices, but that's ok because lighthearted romances are all in fun.  But there's nothing lighthearted or funny about a violent young man who seems to have no control and no limits to the amount of physical damage he will do to anyone he thinks is getting too close to \\"his girl\\".  This is a horrifying portrait of the worst kind of dysfunction and it rivals Twilight for nightmare examples of \\"love\\" set for young women.    Although it seemed like a nearly non-existent roommate could be the catalyst for helping the young heroine, Abby, understand the difference between true love and co-dependency and maybe introduce her to some new friends, that doesn't happen.  Abby treats everyone around her shabbily while allowing herself to be isolated, and somehow no one seems inclined to help her break away from the boy who threatens to beat any males who speak to her and attempts to control every aspect of her life.  There is so much beating and punching and blood in this book, I kept waiting for the police to show up, or for some adult to notice something terrible was happening.  There are seemingly no adults in these people's lives.    By the end of the book, I was expecting Abby to discover he had sabotaged their condoms in order to bind her to him with a pregnancy, if not with handcuffs.  As many people have noted in their reviews, love is often messy and full of difficult times and problems to be solved.  But this wasn't a story of love.  This was a story of teenage angst gone way too far for way too long.
0553801473|5.0|I will give it 5 stars, because the rating system on Amazon was not devised with this kind of experiment in mind. Rating Dance with Dragons would be like rating only one chapter from The Three Musketeers and saying how flawed the novel is because the passage is weaker than the rest. I think Mr. Martin deserves a whole galaxy of stars, and I, for one, will thank him for his labors and wait patiently for the next installment. This said, I would give minus 5 stars to Mr. Martin's publishers. Those people have been getting not fat, but obese on royalties from ASOIAF, and you'd think they might use a tiny amount of those profits to pay someone to read and edit Mr. Martin's text. This is what editors do, it's their job. I have a score of things in mind, but I will take only one example : in AFFC, Sam escorts Maester Aemon and Gilly south. On the way, it is borne on him that Gilly's misery is not the result of seasickness or homesickness, but of having had to give up her baby. This was a beautiful use of POV. Things were happening, the plot was moving forward (slowly admittedly), and Mr. Martin saved us a piece of melodramatic narrative by having the truth pieced together retrospectively by a naive, unsuspecting narrator. Beautiful. Then comes Dance with Dragon with a Jon chapter plodding over the episode at length, telling us nothing we do not know in a much less effective and dramatic way, obliterating the sheer elegance of the previous Sam POV. And why ? Because Mr. Martin probably jotted down a storyline in the first place, then had the various events told by different narrators, played about with the POVs, then juggled with chapters and possibly forgot to edit the passage from the Jon POV. But that, to my mind, was not Mr. Martin's job. That was the job of an editor, one who was not so close to his stuff that he had difficulty stepping back and viewing the architecture of the series from a distance. Editing out the Jon POV was the job of his publishers. Dear Mr. Martin, you are my hero, I'm reading A Dance with Dragons and savoring every minute of it,  but frankly, your publishers suck.

B0033QC0WE|5.0|This is in my view probably the finest \\"period instrument\\" set of the complete Beethoven symphonies.  The crispness, vigor, and excitement of the Eroica and Fifth are a match for just about any other recording regardless of style, and the sound is superb.  (Of course, opinions will vary widely on interpretive points, overall architecture, etc.)  The Ninth is to my ear more successful than the much-touted Roger Norrington version, and all the other performances here are, it seems to me, at least very good.    Incidentally, Gardiner's recordings of the Mozart piano concertos with Malcolm Bilson at the fortepiano are also without peer in the \\"historically informed\\" category.  For years I have hated the sound of the fortepiano, but this album made me a convert.  Absolutely splendid all around.    Obviously, in all of this repertoire (Beethoven Syms, Mozart PCs), there are many other great recordings on modern instruments, but for \\"period\\" performances, I hold these to be the best.
B00506NRBS|5.0|A breathe of fresh air!  simple, basic, and effective thoughts on how to run a business.  The right way, not the \\"buzzwords du jour\\" of fickly Wall Street.
B004LWZW2E|5.0|I dont leave a lot of reviews but I liked this movie a lot.  I love horror movies and agree with many of the other reviews.  This movie is excellent.  Paranormal Activity meets The Excorcist meets Poltergeist.  Wish it would have had a digital copy :(  but still 5 stars.
B00065MDSG|5.0|WIth that being said, you can guess all I will do is say how great an album this is. Each of their albums have different themes and some seem to be sequels to other albums. I think of Starless and Bible Black as somewhat of a sequel to this album. I know some will say I am nuts but there are a lot of the same types of dynamics and range on both the albums. They are my favorite two by KC.     Another thing about LTIA is that it is the total package. I had never heard these guys in 1974 when I bought this and I bought it because of the album cover! How can you pass it up, totally cool. When I first put it on I was joyfully shocked at what I was hearing. I was really stuck on LTIA part 1 for a long time especially with the fierce violin playing in the coda. Even from the beginning with the finger piano......just great!    All the other songs are great and fit well together on the album but Easy Money is the one that really stuck out. There are other songs on the album that \\"build up\\" but this song was ultimate in that way and going back to SABB it reminded me much of We Will Let You Know although no vocals in that song.    This is not an album to put on at parties even though I did back then but even so there were some people who went out and bought this after they heard it at my house.    And to agree with other reviewers here, the musicianship is superb. I dont know what it is but the way these guys play, it is like marrying century old culture with the newest cutting edge music available. I still have the original album and CD.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|By the time HBO gets around to adapting seasons four and five of A Song Of Ice and Fire, they will be sorely tempted to turn the ever-expanding plot mess over to J.J. Abrams.<br /><br />After principal photography is completed, Abrams will prevail on Martin to re-write The Winds of Winter to emphasize that R'hllor is actually Milo Rambaldi.<br /><br />A Dream of Spring will then tie up no loose threads from the first five books in the series, but will instead ambiguously resolve a temporal causality loop clumsily introduced at the end of TWoW.  (Spoiler alert: in the final chapter, Jon Snow's father will turn out to be Rickon Stark.)<br /><br />As for A Dance With Dragons:  (1) I stayed up late to read it and enjoyed doing so.  (2) I trust that Martin is actually going to bring this all together in the 1500-2000 pages he had left.<br /><br />Three years from now, when I re-read the whole series, I would be happy to send Martin ten bucks for an authoritative map of Westeros and Essos along with a chronologically ordered version of AFFC and ADWD.  It's hard enough to keep track of who knows what when whilst the chapters are running in order - I gave it up for a bad job about 200 pages in.  (Digital rights being what they are, Amazon should arrange this as an add-on for their Kindle customers who bought AFFC and ADWD.)  If there's no chronological re-issue, then next time I'll re-read The Man in the High Castle and All You Zombies first as a warm-up.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Best movie I have seen with Matthew McConaghey and Marisa Tomei makes you<br />stop and think,There are really people out there that kill and injure people<br />and think they can get away with it.. and I know that there are lawyers that<br />can make the system work if push comes to shove.. Thought provoking movie ..<br /><br />Excellant cast and story line , I would see this again .. an enjoyable movie.<br />you wont be sorry you watched it . Good pace from begining to end.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love the slow volume increase and the ability to limit the number of snoozes. The extra large snooze burton it's great, too.
0811875040|2.0|One thing you don't expect in a recipe book is errors.  There are so many in Miette I ended up returning it.  I couldn't trust the directions and couldn't waste the time.  It is a pretty book but should be pulled from distribution.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|This is great if you like to organize your apps by category.  You can even nest folders inside folders.  The app is updated and enhanced regularly.  I use it often to keep all my apps in places where I can easily find them.  Well worth the price!
B004Y1USV2|4.0|A year ago I was nervous about Yes recording a new album; but they really pulled the rabbit out of the hat with this new album. Bringing back the Buggles (Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes) was a stroke of genius; and as I see it (...or hear it), it's DRAMA part 2. The only down side for me, was that there was no re-recording of 1980's \\"Go Through This,\\" which would have been a nice rocker for the second half of this album. As for the sound quality, it is very good and I'm sure it would have sounded even better with a little less compression in the mastering stage. Still, not bad sounding at all in this day and age.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you're an open minded Yes fan, you will enjoy FLY FROM HERE.
B004WKOCP8|2.0|Ive listened to it 5 times. Here is the rub. Its like an Incubus cover band playing rearranged and slowed down Incubus songs. If Incubus started sounding like Coldplay. Its just straight up boring. Not bad, just really really dull. I would dread having to see these songs played live. I really like the cover art.
0553584537|5.0|I read all the 4 and 5 star ratings.  I agree with all of them.  Very interesting, a real page turner, well developed characters, nasty bad guys etc.  Just one little thing didn't ring true to me.  And that was Bobby.  For being an expereinced sniper he spent a lot of time second-guessing himself.  I don't presume to know how a sniper is coached and trained but his behavior and thoughts didn't seem genuine to me.  I won't go so far as to say he was a cry-baby but that's the melodramatic way his self flagellation seemed to me.  I wanted to say, \\"quit being a chump, you did your job, now act like a man.\\"  No real professional would have continued to pursue the widow and put himself furhter in career jeopardy like Bobby did.  And for goodness sake, give him a more macho name.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|GET THIS BOOK!!!!!!! I just got it a few days ago and I have already read it 2 times. Both times I have read it within a few hours. I could not put it down.<br /><br />This is not your average college romance love story, and that's what I love about this book. Life is not all about fun and games and perfect relationships that we always read about and see on tv and movies. This author really portrayed something out of real life in my opinion. Something that I can really see happening everyday between many couples.<br /><br />I don't want to give away any spoilers so all I will say is get this book. you will not regret it.
B0043GAZYS|4.0|I love this movie and I'm glad I got it for only $11 or so, but I guess that's because of all the people who didn't like it.  I can understand why; you need a certain sense of humor and background for it to really click.  It's one of those movies that isn't good or bad, it just either works for you or it doesn't.    But I had trouble with the Blu-Ray.  I paused it at one point for several minutes.  When I came back, there appeared to be a screen saver from Universal playing off the disc or something, but I couldn't wake it up.  Or so it seemed.  The timer on the player was ticking off like it was playing, but it was still just the screen saver.  I had to hit menu to free it up and start it playing again.  After that it twice pixelated and skipped as if it were a bad DVD.  I was set to return it but I had noticed when I jumped back to the beginning of the chapter, it didn't happen the second time through.  So I watched it again, this time without pausing and it played through just fine.  I really don't want to bother returning it, and it may not even be something with the disc, so, whatever.    I already had BDLive content turned off, so that didn't bother me, but it does seem like they tried to cram a bunch of that stuff in there, whether it was a good idea or not.  Felt like someone trying to justify Blu-Ray.
B00393SFU2|5.0|Fritz Lang was one of the greatest directors of all time. After all these decades, after so many crime films, this film still packs a strong punch, the more so as there is nothing graphic in the way of violence or sex. It's just like Hitchcock. When you have talent, you have talent.    The acting---even in tiny little details---is still superb. The camera angles. The plot. Everything. The juxtaposition between the heads of law enforcement and of the criminal gangs in their respective meetings going over how to catch the child murderer, alone, makes the film worth watching. As for Peter Lorre, his trademark protruding eyes are perfect for expressing the panic in a cornered rat.
B004XJHBCE|2.0|most phones already do what the app does, at least the main point of the app. I used it for a little while, but it is pointless. Just takes up space and uses CPU. I was concerned about some of the permissions considering the app was just trying to reinvent the wheel.
B000VM9Z8K|4.0|I never tire of reading Sophie Kinsella's novels.  They are always easy to read, light, funny and yet snippets of life lessons can be found in them.  Her female leads are always simple and down to earth, characters that women can generally relate to.     \\"Remember Me?\\" is a story of a girl who suffered amnesia and thus forgot all about the last 3 years of her life, which unfortunately was when the more important events  of her life happened - she apparently catapulted in her career and married the ideal husband.  The story is proof that sometimes, no matter what ones state of mind is, it's the state of the heart that matters.
B004I654WQ|5.0|This movie is great for boys and girls alike. My two year old was enamored and actually had a CARS party for her third birthday. She became obsessed with collecting each of the CARS. She was also the only girl in her daycare with lightup Lightening McQueen shoes (yes, boys shoes - they make NO girl CARS stuff). The movie is cute and the G rating is appropriate. There is only one scary scene where Mater and Lightening go \\"tractor tipping\\" and a large tractor named \\"Frank\\" chases them through the field. The story is simple enough for young children to understand the plot, but interesting enough for the parents that will no doubt have to sit through it countless times.
1451629184|5.0|This novel was one of the most intriging and honest books I have ever read. Jaycee  is very open and brutally honest. I am amazed at how evovled and aware she is, even though she was held captive and was not aloud to form any relationships aside from her captors. She has a lot of self awareness, and she has truly inspired me. My hope is that who ever reads this will see that it takes a truly amazing person to survive what she did and still want to be a better person!!!
B005AUWXZ0|1.0|Highly disappointed in this much anticipated movie.  My daughter has been enamoured with CARS since she was two years old.  She had a CARS themed party for her third birthday.  She had CARS shoes, clothing, toys.  It was only logical that her first trip to the movie theater should be for CARS2.  For a year we had been looking forward to this trip and the release of the movie.  Unfortunately, we were extremely disappointed.  This movie is very different from the first.  It is very violent - lot s of shooting - and the story line is too complex for the 3-6 year old crowd.  The story line is centered around a truck that used to own an oil company, he ran out of gas in the wilderness, sold his company and decided to produce a bio-fuel.  He had a world wide race with the cars only using this new fuel.  The the \\"bad cars\\" start to blow up the race cars with a lazer that makes the fuel explode.  *Spoiler alert* - turns out, the truck that produces the bio-fuel owns the larges underwater oil field in the world and is trying to convince everyone to give up looking for a suitable bio-fuel and switch back to gas.  What?  How is a four year old supposed to understand this?  I have NO IDEA how it got a G rating, as How To Train Your Dragon is less violent than this movie, in my opinion, and that is PG.  After the first ten minutes, my daughter was in my lap crying that she wanted to go home!!!
B0042RUMH8|5.0|I have only had a chance to listen to this CD once, a few days ago, because my girlfriend bought it, played it for me, and promptly took it home.  Nevertheless, I loved every song on it.  It has a mix of styles and J.Lo's voice sounds much better than before.  I was surprised when the album was over.  In fact, I was making dinner, which I sometimes hate, but I ended up dancing to the music, and dinner was ready before I realized it.  It's just a fun album.  I really need to steal it from my girlfriend.

0786939532|5.0|After being recommended by several people to read Homeland, I can say that I am NOT disappointed.  The story flows very well and is quick paced.  The introduction of the Drow race and the character Drizzt is intriguiging and addictive.  Of the fantasy books I've read, Homeland has been one of the few that has made me want to continue the series.    The recommendations of this novel/series has definately solidified by reading the first book.  Anyone who has read Dragonlance/Wheel of Time will definately appreciate these books.    I can't wait to continue this apparently epic series with the next in line!
0553801473|4.0|It seems to me more than ever that these two books should have been combined into one super book with a corresponding price. This way nobody could complain that nothing happened. Because truth be told a lot happens in both books just not enough. It's like eating an 8oz steak when what you really wanted was a 10oz.<br /><br />In this book we jump around so much as a reader, that certain story lines just lose their interest because they don't have enough meat. Certain chapters just don't have enough to keep your interest because frankly, they just don't seem all that important to the grand scheme of things.<br /><br />Often times I found myself skipping ahead to see how long I had to wait before I got to read the more important and meaty points of view.<br /><br />Tyrion's chapters while entertaining were mostly uneventful filled with constant traveling. There is one big surprise one little surprise and him using his cunning to shape certain events.<br /><br />Jon's chapters were very interesting to me because of the effect his actions will have in the next book. I think some people have underestimated how important his chapters were in the grand scheme of things. His actions will have a big effect on the big battles ahead. Who fights who, who follows who, and who has influence  in the north will be heavily affected by his decisions.<br /><br />Bran's chapters are very peculiar and very interesting. Based on what you learn in a Dance of Dragons you realize he is very important. However, the more we learn the weirder and more fascinating things get. There are some answers to some important questions we've had for awhile but you really have to comb over Bran's chapters to get all of the hints. Also a lot more intriguing questions are raised.<br />Also when comparing the information you learn in the prologue to Bran's chapters, it makes you stop and think very very very hard...I will say no more.<br /><br />Daenerys chapters were the most disappointing to me. I won't elaborate as to why exactly I feel this way, others have said enough. I know she's important. So I look forward to her future role. But for right now just not that interesting. Not that they aren't eventful but they just don't seem as important right now to Westeros. However, based on events that happen. I expect her to be much more important next book.<br /><br />There are other POV's as well that get a good chunk of attention and are important. But I don't want to spoil them. There are a few surprises that will entertain you upon discovery. However, in my opinion they aren't truly game altering until the next book.

0345529057|5.0|After reading some of the reviews for this box set, I was really hesitant to purchase it, but I ended up doing so. I could not be happier... I am not sure what some of the negative reviewers are talking about... there is no problems with the font size, its exactly the same as any other paperback book I have ever read. No missing pages, or mis-cut pages. Maybe the publisher recalled the problemed ones and reprinted them. Either way, my set is perfect.
B004KSQN7C|1.0|I tried, I tried, I tried. I tried to listen to this album, not once but twice. I tried to hear the Britney that we fell in love with; the Britney that came out when I was 15 and turning up the radio every time her song came on. I tried to appreciate (tolerate might be a better word) some of the songs. I tried.<br /><br />But every time I tried to like I fell... (So dorky, I know.) Look, I am not going to sit here and bash Britney. She's got enough critics to do that for me. I am also not an obsessive Britney fan. I just like good music to listen to while I am working out, or sitting at work bored and need a wake up. But I also like my music to have depth, to have soul, to mean something. This album sounds like a computer created disaster that producers threw together with simple lyrics that rhyme. Where the heck is her voice? She certainly doesn't have Whitney Houston vocals, but at least in her earlier work we actually heard her singing.<br /><br />Frankly, if I wanted another techno CD I would've taken my $15.00 elsewhere.<br /><br />She's been trying to have a major comeback for the last few years, and it's just not happening. Every album that comes out they say \\"this is the one that will put her on track,\\" but it does nothing for me.<br /><br />She's had her run, she's been in the spotlight, but now is the time she should just step down.
1400052181|5.0|I bought this book because it was required for a class.  I could not put it down.  Such an amazing story and a must read.
B004K4AVAG|4.0|I am sure there are many like me; I have never failed to be disappointed by the singles that Lady Gaga puts out.. nor am I never NOT entertained by her fashion or the things she has to say.<br /><br />I thought she was just another senseless pop singer, but after listening to her on an interview on VH1 she is very intelligent and very passionate about her music. This made me like her more, and I began to think of her as a future icon comparable to Madonna, if she remains on the road she is going.<br /><br />I have never purchased a Gaga CD, but after all the publicity on her song Judas and the reviews on Amazon I decided to give it a try. Again, Gaga hasn't disappointed me.<br /><br />This album is PERFECT for working out. Most all of the songs are upbeat and all of them have a strong message for the topics that Gaga is passionate about.<br /><br />Some Favorites that MUST be heard:<br />*Marry the Night (great, great, great beat. If this doesn't pump you up while running I don't know what will)<br />*Born This Way (actually reminds me of Madonna, with an amazing beat and very catchy lyrics.)<br />*Schibe (she starts by speaking German, which threw me off, but the song is sassy and again, another great working out song. Love the lyrics: If you're a strong woman, you don't need permission.)<br />*Hair (I especially love the chorus, where she says This is my prayer, I'll die living just as free as my hair. Again, another pump up song.)<br /><br />The rest of the songs I had to listen to more than once to really appreciate them, but I am definitely coming around.<br /><br />If you need a good pump up CD for working out, or just to get pumped up for the night, this album is the right choice :)
B002UNMW7O|1.0|Wow. This may literally be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I love the first Boondock Saints, so I was super excited to see the sequel. What a mistake. I couldn't even make it all the way through All Saints Day. About 20 minutes in, I turned the movie off because I couldn't stand to watch any more. The acting is horrible, the dialogue is cheesy and cliche, and replacing some of the main characters was a huge mistake. Like swapping in the red headed woman for Willem Dafoe as the lead detective? Are you kidding me? And the crazy guy they threw in to replace Rocco from the original, but who really has no place in the movie? Again, wow. Everything about this movie is bad. Don't waste your time. Seriously.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|It took me a little to warm up to this album (it's pretty long, it was hard to listen to it all in one sitting), but after constantly having it in my car, I'm in love.  The songs are just so much fun! Great beats, and fun themes.  She's just an all around awesome artist :)
630463949X|4.0|I had watched this dvd at a friend's house before I bought it, so I knew what to expect.  Lindsey Buckingham's finger picking is the best you'll find on any dvd.  The only drawback I have seen is there is no menu to setup the audio features.  But the dvd still sounds great, and I would recommend it for any FleetwoodMac, or music fan.
B00335EQ0E|5.0|I grew up watching Walt Disney movies and I have always enjoyed them.  \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is no exception.  I have always liked Walt Disney and I probably will until my death.  Regarding my age, I am sixty-three years old.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I enjoyed this one!  Compelling viewpoint characters returned, and the new characters were also well done.  There was refreshingly little Cersei.<br /><br /> \\"Dance with Dragons\\" came through with what it promised:  the interesting parts of the story omitted in \\"Feast for Crows.\\"

B004VBAHG6|3.0|I am a Murphy fan from way back and so I feel bad if I don't have the entire collection of his stuff. I love him but some of his solo stuff is quite lame,actually. He says he is no longer an icon but he will always be the face of Bauhaus. I'm happy that he is still doing music..although it's more like poetry. I will probably keep buying his CD's.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|I bought this app a month ago and have used it every day since.  it allows you to create folders and subfolders with different categories of apps.  You can then create shortcuts with the categories and assign a meaningful icon for them.  Worth paying for!

B005DC68NI|5.0|David Gaughran is an up-and-coming writer whose two short story collections have garnered him critical acclaim, while his blog has become one of the go-to resources for self-publishing tips, news, and opinion. Now Gaughran has packaged his best self-publishing advice (along with lots of new material and the success stories of several other self-published authors) into a convenient, low-priced must-read book.    \\"Let's Get Digital\\" covers all the indie-publishing bases with practical advice based on Gaughran's own experience. You can tell Gaughran really enjoys the subject of self-publishing.    Gaughran talks about the recent wave of self-publishing success stories, Amazon's power, the importance of cover design and professional editing, formatting, writing, short stories, pricing, international differences, blogging, marketing, social media, reviews, giveaways, various e-publishing options, what to do when your sales stop, and contains several resources you should get familiar with.    While instructional, \\"Let's Get Digital\\" is also inspirational, sure to spur any newbie author forward in pursuit of their publishing dreams. While there are other books which focus more on some of the technical aspects (such as formatting and design), Gaughran does a fine job of covering the basics and pointing you towards some free resources to delve deeper if you need to.     All in all, \\"Let's Get Digital\\" is a fine addition to any self-published author's shelf, and great information and inspiration from an author you ought to be watching.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|I have been using the lite version and have loved it. Custom icons and a notification every time you install an app are my favorite features. (notification is to file the app). No problems and I've been using it for months.
B004XWMXW4|4.0|I am mad about the cello, and it's easy to be impressed by these young men sawing away at their instruments for all they are worth, cranking out classic pop/rock tunes on the Cello.  It is certainly worth hearing, but I'm not sure if I need to hear \\"Smooth Criminal\\" for two cellos more than 2 or three times.  Separated from the YouTube experience and intensity of seeing them play, it becomes a little odd, like a pumped up muzak that got a little out of hand.  Some of these songs benefit more from the cello treatment than others--in particular, Nirvana's \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" becomes a dark and brooding melodic masterwork on these instruments.  I would never have imagined that, and for that reason alone, I'm gonna play this record for some friends.  But Guns and Roses \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" just left me wanting the original.  This is more of a novelty disc than new life for old repertoire, but if you approach this less as a serious exercise and more as a chance to have some fun, you won't be sorry.  Try to see a couple of their youtube vids before you buy, and you'll know what I mean about the visual intensity of the duo.
B004XISI4A|3.0|A few observations.<br /><br />1: The book was well written stylistically, but I'm beginning to see traces of author fatigue where he's re-using the same characterizations over and over. There are no fewer than three separate characters in ADWD that have \\"hands as big as hams\\".<br /><br />2: I get the impression on some level he really did not want to write this book. It's so overwritten and meandering in parts it really does feel like something he attacked little by little, begrudgingly over time. I really don't get the \\"parts of a whole\\" feeling I got with the first two books of a narrative sweep and flow to the story. You can almost feel him chafing as he wrote it.<br /><br />3: While I can appreciate there are multiple POVs this book actually exhausted me with the clicking Viewmaster approach to the storyline with so many character perspectives. It gets to be something of a mess at some point.<br /><br />4: While Danerys and Jon are written from a somewhat \\"right thinking sympathetic hero\\" perspective most of the time they really are kind of stupid in many of the long term strategic decisions they are making and their political opponents are correct. In addition I'm also having trouble with their interior dialogs coming from a 16 year old and an 18 year old. It just doesn't true.<br /><br />I may be out of line here, but I got the feeling from the last 1/4 of the book or so that some of the set pieces (Cersi's naked walk and the Varys kids all coming out of the woodwork as examples) were being deliberately set up with an eye toward the television series.<br /><br />In the end I enjoyed it insofar as it moved the story along and I enjoyed the character dialogs. His conversational flow between characters has actually gotten better over time. As far as the story structure goes it was kind of a mess. I get the feeling that artistically he really is pretty much done with this story, and the fan demands are what keep it going with like a re-animated corpse.<br /><br />As an aside once an author is super successful can he effectively work without editorial supervision? This book could really have used some major pruning.
0394873742|5.0|It took my son (18 months when I gave it to him) about 1 minute to figure out the best way to enjoy this book...Put it on the floor and lay on it. He crawls all over it and finds all the neat little characters.   It did arrive a little damaged from some pretty poor boxing, but I didn't return it; the boy had it dog-eared in a couple of weeks anyway.   A great book to play the \\"find the...\\" game.  One note, the book actually is big! A little bigger than 18\\" x 24\\"

0307165485|5.0|Full disclosure, I had this book as a kid. That being said, it's just the coolest, best toddler/preschool book around. It is too big to haul around, but that's the beauty. It's the at-home book that the kid keeps re-discovering. I have a couple of other Richard Scarry books, and my son loves that some of the content is the same in different books. It's like a little discovery for him, and he remembers the words even quicker.<br />Did I mention this book is great?
B004OZOTSQ|3.0|Seriously, this is a great app. It's very convenient and requires little techie know-how.  It's just not free, like another app that does the same thing.

B004XGN8W4|5.0|I have used mine for about 4 days now and it has worked great.  Brought it to work with me and the guys loved it.  When I got the product it was missing the hdmi cord, but they quickly fixed that by overnight the hdmi cord the next day along with a t shirt.  Although to be honest.  I'm a gamer which tends to make me fat, so of course it doesn't fit.  LOL.  Then later I discovered I had a problem with a few bluerays on the ps3.  It turned out that you have to turn off the 24hz setting on the ps3.  That fixed that problem.  The customer service and support is truely 5 stars.  The product ran fine while at work, had it on for 5 hours straight (no I wasn't playing the whole 5 hours).  It's true that the angle isn't the greatest off to the slide, and the brightness can sometimes be to dim.  I couldn't really play dead space on it, and it was difficult playing a 3-4 player game on it because of the angle.  2 players worked fine though.      What I would like to see is an attachment on the outside the bag that you could put a few games into.  Like have a velco strip on bag.  so you could put in 4 or 6 games on the side.  That and a shoulder strap.  The whole not being 1080p is not an issue.  You can't tell the difference, and if you say you can, you are a liar.  It doesn't mean that the quality is top of the line, but looks great.  If you are on the go a lot, or have kids and want to bring it over to grandma's place.  works great.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|All I can say is \\"great!\\"  Great music, great song-writing, great songs, great VOICE....  So much talent and heart.  I love the whole album, but my LEAST favorite tracks are \\"Don't You Remember\\" (it kind of has a country feel to it that I'm not terribly fond of), \\"One and Only,\\" and \\"Lovesong.\\"  One thing I must say is, the reason I decided to purchase the album is because I found myself watching/listening to her live YouTube performances of \\"Someone Like You\\" over and over again.  After getting used to her live versions, I immediately noticed the album version is different in two ways:  1) the tempo of the album version is much faster, 2) the bridge is harmonized on the album version.  At first I was pretty upset about this, but after listening to the album non-stop for the last three weeks, I've gotten used to it.  However, part of me wishes she would've included a live version of this song on the album.  I loved her first album (19) and in my opinion, this one is ever better!  I'm a fan for life!  Can't wait for her next album!
B004XJHBCE|4.0|A few oddities make this fall short of a 5-star app.  It manages contacts but doesn't import Facebook photos.  It manages bookmarks but only from Browser (which can have the odd effect of opening a Browser bookmark in a different browser).  It has a single-item &quot;widget&quot; which has the identical effect of creating such a shortcut directly from Android.  Still a great app, but I'm looking forward to updates.
0440219078|5.0|The Giver was a required read when I was a freshman in High School. I am so glad I was introduced to this book! This book is set is the future when the world is nothing like it is today. There is no color. Your job is picked for you based on how you act, which the leaders of the society study you as you grow up to determine this. You do not \\"Love\\" the way most people do. Your spouse is picked for you. Nothing is your choice. The Giver is a special person who holds all the knowledge of how the earth use to be. The giver can see color. The giver knows everything. When a young boy gets picked to become the giver, he has no idea what he is getting himself into, and he learns a few things that will change his future for better or for worse.    This is an amazing book. Please read it! You will not be disappointed.

B002GPNQXU|5.0|I just love Demi. She's amazing in everything she does. She's a good singer, she's a good actress. She's just awesome. And one of the many things I love about her is the fact that she has such a good voice. I mean, I always wonder what singers like Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez, etc sound live. Because you know they just fix up their voices with computers. But Demi is different.  She sounds good on cd and live. She really is very talented. You hardly ever find artists such as Demi, Lady Gaga, Greyson Chance, etc who don't lipsynch and who rly have awesome voices. demi is one of those people who can do anything with their voice. she's just so talented. and she's SOO pretty ! i'm so glad she's healthy again and she's come back and is doing music again. I'm actually kinda glad that she dropped Sonny with a chance because, now she can focus on wat she's really really good at - music. I hope wat i was getting at made sense :\ Shes just rly talented and thats all there is to it. (: &lt;3<br /><br />(Btw this was a kids review )
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I must say that this is the best book I've read in a LONG time!! This is up there with one of the best books I have read, EVER!! When I read about this book, I read that it was a young adult book, but adults will like it.  When I started the book, i saw that the girl was 16 and i thought, \\"why am i reading a kid's book? How is this going to be?\\"  But seriously, this is a book that adults and older teens will LOVE!!! I couldn't put this book down, I wanted to call off of work to finish it, but at the same time I didn't want it to end because I enjoyed reading it so much!!  Not to sound cheesy, but the characters really come alive and you really feel what they are feeling.  This book brought tears to my eyes, made me wince, shake my head, and laugh.  I must say that reading this book was truly a pleasure, and as SOON as I am finished with this review I am starting book 2!
030745455X|4.0|Although not as great and compelling as its predecessor, [[ASIN:0307454541 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]], this detective thriller is quite compelling. It's an interesting read with a complicated plot and a somewhat unexpected twist at the end which leaves many unresolved questions - leaves you hanging until you get the last book in the series, [[ASIN:030726999X The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest]].<br /><br />Unfortunately, the book lacks any comic relief elements and has some repeating elements in it's plot - events that closely resemble other events, as though the author didn't have enough imagination to invent something different. In many places it seems like characters have more knowledge than they logically should, although discussions about the situation are quite abundant, maybe too abundant.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I grew up watching this movie, and now I just watched it the other day with my 5 year old son.  I thought some parts may be a bit scary for him, but he loved it !  I remember memorizing the lines when I was young...\\"through dangers untold, and hardships un numbered...\\" and also singing the songs in the movie all the time...David Bowie is awesome in it.  My fav part of the movie is where Sarah eats the apple and falls into a dream, and dances with Bowie (Goblin King), I used to wish I was Sarah!! Anway, unless you grew up watching it....it may not mean as much to you but its still a cute story with lovable creative characters.

B004Y1USV2|4.0|There are a handful of things that identify a Yes recording, and they are not necessarily what you would expect; one of which is the voice of Jon Anderson. The longtime vocalist is not, in fact, the only one in the group's history. It would hardly be Yes without Chris Squire's counterpoint harmony, and Trevor Rabin sang at least fifty percent on the band's most popular offerings. Then we have a period some of the die-hard fans call the \\"dark times,\\" in 1979's Drama album when Anderson and stalwart keyboard player Rick Wakeman were out, replaced by the Buggles, Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes. With them came a distinct sound, edgy rhythms, and a healthy dose of pop and a bit of a nod to punk (see \\"Tempus Fugit\\" for details). For years, many in the fan club thought it to be inferior, rejected Horn as vocalist, and soon the two were out. At least they still had the success of a Buggles tune called \\"Video Killed The Radio Star.\\"<br /><br />Time has been kind to Drama. Once the biases were crossed, it became easy to like the album, even love it. My brother often enthuses that, \\"It's the closest Yes ever got to metal,\\" and in a way I think he's right. Drama was propulsive and, sometimes, really quite heavy. Things happen for a reason though, and had the Drama lineup remained, we wouldn't have seen some of the band's best latter work, not only the obvious choices but the fantastic re-re-reunion disc, The Ladder.<br /><br />We also wouldn't have seen some of their weakest, the well-intentioned but ultimately unsatisfying Magnification, and the disc that still leaves me scratching my head, Open Your Eyes. Both those albums had Jon Anderson as lead vocalist, so it was easy to assume that the band would never fall into the trap of starting up again without him on-board. You were wrong.<br /><br />And I'm happy to say that, as these things tend to be in Yes-land, it's for the best because not only is Fly From Here the latest in this group's long history of reunions, but it is an undeniable reunion of this particular lineup, the Drama configuration. The new element is the inclusion of lead singer Benoit David, who can hit those high, Anderson notes and sing in Rabin and Horn's registers as well. As I am with all these sorts of decisions, I was wary about \\"the new guy\\" - is this going to be yet another instance of dropping in a clone to do the work of the departed member? David, while being tonally spot-on, sings like Benoit David and sounds to me not like he's trying to copycat anyone. That is refreshing.<br />To certify this as a full-fledged Drama reunion, Trevor Horn is in the production seat and adds background vocals, and everyone else seems to have slipped right into place. Steve Howe remains one of the very best at what he does, and every now and then throws some crunch into the works, and Chris Squire's \\"dirty\\" bass still holds it all down nicely. Alan White is Alan White, a drummer that deserves more credit that he often gets, likely because he is behind such respected show-offs.<br />The opening track(s) \\"Fly From Here\\" is a long suite as one would expect from Yes, but don't let it fool you. These are mostly distinct song-sections and can be enjoyed in stand-alone bites. \\"We Can Fly\\" (which actually began during the Drama sessions all those years ago but was never recorded in the studio, according to Horn and Squire),  \\"Sad Night At The Airfield,\\" and \\"Madman At The Screens\\" all have moments that let you know this is a unique and very particular identity, and that is the musical voice of Horn and Geoff Downes who wrote the majority of the record. The switch-up comes midway with \\"Bumpy Ride,\\" a Steve Howe contribution that sounds more like Tormato's \\"Arriving UFO\\" but returns to the central theme of the \\"We Can Fly\\" melody.<br /><br />Is this a perfect release? No, there are moments that don't cohere as well as others, like \\"Life On A Film Set\\" which lyrically has little to do with movie sets. There's a bit where the line \\"You're riding a tiger\\" is repeated over and over, and it doesn't make much sense, but when has a Yes lyric ever really made sense? What keeps the track from being a skip is that the band sounds really enthusiastic, and genuinely happy to be performing, but I'll circle around to that thought in a moment.<br />The barometer of success with any of this band's work is repeat listenability. Detractors of Yes would argue that none of their stuff bears repeat listening, while those with specific notions of the group would counter that their poppiest stuff is in direct violation to some unwritten rule. Anderson's biggest supporters may balk because of his absence, and I can relate to them on some level. It is hard to just let go of one of the key figures of a sound.<br />But Fly From Here is extremely listenable, and highly enjoyable. It is mellower than Drama was, but that was also thirty-two years ago, and that sad reality has to be factored in. Even so, the record is remarkable in the sense that, had the Drama lineup been embraced by the core audience, this is the album they would have followed up with. Is it better than The Ladder? No, and the more I hear that disc, the more appreciative I am of it, but Fly From Here is likely the second-best album the band's put out in twenty years, liable to be denigrated in the short-term, but equally liable to be rediscovered later on.and it doesn't make much sense, but when has a Yes lyric ever really made sense?

B000W7JWUA|5.0|My family of four is loving this game. Easy to play, great strategy, enough chance, and a board that is different every time we play. I would highly recommend Catan for families who are done with Life and Uno. Get thinking and have fun!
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|First of all, we saw the \\"normal\\" movie, not the 3D. My 4 year old daughter did not care much about the plot. She was mesmerized with the cars, the color and the fast pace.    From the moment it starts, it becomes evident the movie is a parody of a James Bond film, so people who do not like 007 will probably not like this one either. The way the plot is presented (conspiracy by one individual to discredit ethanol so that oil sales prevail), I do not believe it should be taken seriously, but it probably still is a reflection of what goes on in real life, something which, of course, anyone younger than 14 will most likely have a hard time comprehending.    The animation of the cities is amazing (just as is the animation of Rio de Janeiro in the movie Rio): Tokyo, London, and a fantasy city, Porto Corsa, which is a mixture of both Monte Carlo and the Amalfi Coast, are impressive, especially for those who have had the opportunity to visit the real places.    The characters' names are hilarious and there is a story behind almost all of them; the catch is that one needs to know a bit about car racing and other things to get these \\"inside jokes\\". For instance, Francesco Bernoulli's name is a reference to Daniel Bernoulli, a scientist who worked on fluid dynamics and conservation of energy theories. The yellow pick-up, John Lassetire, is an obvious reference to the movie's director, John Lasseter. Those who speak French will know that the family name of the French car, Raoul CaRoule, means \\"it rolls\\" (both in the sense that it moves on wheels, and that it goes fine). Another one of the cars, not a racing one though, is Prince \\"Wheeliam\\", an obvious reference. Fernando Alonso, one of the Spanish cars, borrows its name from a well-known Spanish Formula 1 racer, just like the Mexican car, Memo Rojas, which only appears in the version made for Latin America (by the way, the movie has six versions, for different regions of the world, with slight variations in the characters to fit each of them). Carla Veloso, the Brazilian and only female car, reminds us of a samba school dancer. The accents that accompany each of the cars match their personalities to a tee, and are equally as funny. And there are probably many more of these \\"resemblances\\" to real life that I missed.    So this movie has different \\"levels\\", interesting for people of different ages, which is kind of unusual for a kids' movie. I would probably not want to see Toy Story twice, but I would indeed enjoy watching Cars 2 a couple times more, for fun, and to catch what I missed the first time. I believe Pixar is doing an amazing job in this aspect. The reason why some people did not like the movie is probably either because they do not like James Bond style movies or because they were not able to see beyond the plot and the violence. I would even say that the movie might be more interesting for adults than for children, but that would be its only default.

B000002U88|5.0|Detroit singer/songwriter/rocker Bob Seger released his twelfth studio album The Distance in December of 1982.<br />By 1982, Bob had five straight Multi Platinum selling classic albums out of Live Bullet, Night Moves, Stranger in Town, Against the Wind (which hit #1 in 1980) and then 1981's Nine Tonight. Then, as Bob came off a year long sabbatical (took all of 1981 off apart from mixing Nine Tonight), he and The Silver Bullet Band (which featured bass player Chris Campbell, sax player Alto Reed, keyboard player Craig Frost and also the last to guitarist Drew Abbott (who appears on just two tracks))  plus veteran session drummer Russ Kunkel and numerous female backing singers (on all tracks except \\"Comin' Home\\") plus help by The Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section (drummer Roger Hawkins, guitarists Jimmy Johnson and Pete Carr, bass player David Hood and the late keyboard player Barry Beckett) (on \\"Comin' Home\\") with producer Jimmy Iovine (now president of Interscope Music but back in 1982 a red hot producer/engineer who worked with Tom Petty, Stevie Nicks and Bruce Springsteen) to work on Bob's first album of new material in almost three years. Was it worth the wait, it sure was when I first heard as a freshly turned 7 year old in late January of 1983 when my mom (may she RIP) bought on vinyl.<br />We begin with the stellar Us Top 20 hit hard rocker \\"Even Now\\" which featured Roy Bittan of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band on piano and former Eagle Don Felder on electric guitar. Next was the rocker \\"Making Thunderbirds\\" which features Bonnie Raitt on backing vocals and one of two tracks with Drew Abbott's guitar playing. This song is a great song. Next is another rock radio hit \\"Boomtown Blues\\" which just rocks and has Don Felder on guitar plus a stellar sax solo from Alto. Next is the first single and the album's biggest hit, the country tinged ballad \\"Shame On the Moon\\" (written by Rodney Crowell) which is a great song that peaked at #2 on the charts in early 1983 and included Little Feat's Billy Payne on piano and Eagle Glenn Frey on harmony vocals and last song Drew Abbott recorded with The Silver Bullet Band before he quit the band due to Bob using session players more than ever. The first half ends with another ballad \\"Love's the Last to Know\\" which is one of Bob's best ballads and again has Bill Payne on piano and Elton John guitarist Davey Johnstone on acoustic guitar.<br />The second half of the album begins with the rocker and the final US Top 30 hit \\"Roll Me Away\\" which features Roy Bittan on piano once again plus Michael Boddicker on synthesizers and Waddy Wachtel on guitar. Next is another great rocker \\"House Behind a House\\" which rocks and has Bob and Danny Kortchmar on guitars. We then have the epic ballad \\"Coming Home\\" which is a great ballad which has The Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section's last recording on a Bob Seger album plus a heartwarming synthesizer solo from Bill Payne and stellar alto sax solo from Alto Reed. We close the album with the excellent rocker \\"Little Victories\\" which is the first time a Bob Seger album ended on a rocking note since Night Moves' closing rocking cover of \\"Mary Lou\\" in 1976.

B004BBDHEK|4.0|After reading many of the reviews here on Amazon, I realized that I was not alone in recognizing the brilliance of this album. I also discovered that I was not the only one who was disappointed with Yanni's \\"Voices\\". In my opinion, Yanni should never be put in a box with lyrical content. Once you add lyrics to a song, the definition is no longer left up to the listener and it loses much of its beauty and mystic.     In \\"Truth of Touch\\", lyrical content is only found in three tracks. Many reviewers have taken the time to examine each track, but I will only discuss my favorite and least favorite tracks.    Favorite tracks  1. Truth of Touch: This is a beautiful track that kicks things off with a happy vibe. I enjoyed this track thoroughly and found that it was the perfect opener.  4. Voyage: This track might be my favorite on the album. Starts out with a hint of darkness, then turns into a mysterious adventure. The title \\"Voyage\\" could not be more fitting.   10. O Luce Che Brilla Nell' Oscurità: I wasn't a fan of Nathan's vocals on \\"Voices\\" because he was a little over the top, even for an opera singer. However, his vocals are stellar here and it fits the song perfectly. A choir backs him up at the end and the song takes him to the top of his range. Very powerful and moving.    Least favorite tracks:  8. Can't Wait: I like Leslie Mills' voice, but this song just doesn't fit on a Yanni album. It sounds like a top 100 pop song. The lyrics are shallow as well.  11. I'm So: I like the track, but it's a little difficult to figure out what Yanni was trying to do here. This is perhaps a little too experimental.  15. Secret: In my humble opinion, Chloe has become Yanni's sex symbol. When you see her live, she prances around the stage in very revealing clothing and acts like she's willing to go with anyone at anytime. This sickens me as Yanni doesn't need this to sell records. I've always thought of Yanni's concerts as a safe, family atmosphere (BTW, I am a male in my twenties). Now I would hesitate to take my children to one his concerts because of Chloe. She has a lovely voice and I don't doubt her writing ability, but I was highly disappointed in this track. The music is great, the vocals are fantastic, but the lyrics leave something to be desired. \\"I, I've got a secret/I won't tell if you won't/and nobody's got to know oh know/nobody's got to know/I've got a secret/Can you keep it/Nobody's got to know. Verse 2 goes on to say, \\"Try to forgot the past\\" then she goes on to write, \\"Just for this minute/why don't we finish what we started long ago\\" Wait...you just told me to forget the past??? I think this track could have been wonderful, as it sounds like an Evanescence song, but the lack of lyrical depth upsets me. It took me all of two seconds to figure out what she was talking about. Perhaps this song might speak to someone that's in the middle of a forbidden relationship (I use this word lightly). Okay, I've vented enough.    Overall, this is a terrific album and I think this is the best cd that Yanni has put out in years.

Sometimes, it's just good to read for fun and not worry about getting anything deeper from it.  I had a hard time to decide how many stars I should give.  Definitely a 5 for it's easy to read and can't put it down qualities, but a 2 for the it's lack of depth.  Average: 3 1/2 but read it for the fun of it.

This book might not be as technologically-charged as the Iron Man art books in terms of contents. However, it's still beautiful and offers a different take on the superhero designs with its Norse mythology-based characters.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the cover picture is a piece of paper glued to the leather dust jacket.

Anne Frank's experience in \\"The Secret Annex\\" was a very interesting one. She does not always look on the bad side, but she does not always look on the good. She writes incredibly well for her young age, and has a very unique handwriting(if you have seen her real handwriting). This book was a interesting and good example as how most girls might have felt during World War II. She has made a mark in the world, you have to give her credit for her good writing.

Some of the descriptions literally made me cringe at how sickeningly sweet Picoault tried to make their relationship seem. The ending was a let down, and seemed rushed. Too many loose ends with no explaination. However, what annoyed me most was the repetition of phrases (\\"She snorted\\".), as well as some inconsistencies which should have been caught by an editor. I didn't hate it, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it. I liked this the least of all her books I have read.

I had hoped that the characters I had read about in A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, A Storm of Swords and A Feast for Crows would continue their journeys and provide me with some excellent entertainment. However, while Dance is not terrible, it is stagnant. I wanted movement from the characters and possibly some resolutions of their plights and challenges. Instead, I got 900 pages of turtles, traveling and annoyance, but no resolutions. In the future I'll most likely wait to borrow a copy of Winds of Winter from my library instead of purchasing an expensive hardcopy.

There are an enormous number of plot lines, but none of them really get resolved.  The writing is extremely wordy, with tons of useless details but no movement.  By the end of the book I was skimming.  The author omits a lot of important events; suspense is created by wondering what is going to happen, not wondering what happened.  All that creates is frustration.<br /><br />Some of the characters are interesting.  I wish they would do something.
0553801473|4.0|I think going into this I expected a companion to AFFC, with about the same amount of resolution.  I am completely satisfied with where the book went and I feel that things are set up nicely for a brilliant finish.  Now...do I expect this to be wrapped up in two books?  Of course not.  Do I expect to see the next book before 2016?  Maybe a little, but I should know better.  The rating is based on the merits of this book alone, and the same high standard of writing continues.  People that expected things to be much further along haven't been paying attention and I recommend that you maybe do what thousands of other fans are doing: wait until he has finished the series to continue reading it.  Just don't hold your breath :).
B0055S348W|1.0|You are paying $7.99 for what is essentially a free trail version of the app.  When you go to print, it will print a test page and then inform you you need to spend another $12.95 to be able to print the described items from your device.  I have no issue, paying for a good app, but do not want to pay $8.00 for a trial version that prints a test page.  This is agood app, but get the free version of the demo and if you like it, buy the key for $12.95.  Do not buy the $7.99 version.
B004D44WY4|5.0|I never get tired of Jack Reacher and of course he prevails in this taut and riveting thriller. His description of firing a sniper rifle over a long distance is completely engrossing and I don't like guns. Lee Child is a masterful author. He never bores.
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|A very cute movie.  I had seen it on Cable TV, but wanted to watch it again and again. The scenery was wonderful and the dogs were darling. All the critters were full of personality. It's very appropriate for children as well. An excellent Family Movie.  I've decided I want a Chihuahua!
B004XJHBCE|5.0|This is a fantastic app to help un-clutter your home screen. I was getting sick of the stock folder icon! Lots of customization options and a very clean interface.
0307716988|5.0|This gave me insight into the greatest talent on earth. It was surprising that Michael Jackson was so much like everyone else, just extremely focused and talented. He was truly gifted.
0553801473|2.0|I was really looking forward to this book, wow was I disappointed.  Absolutely nothing was accomplished and the story remained stalled.  At this pace the rest of the story will fill another 5 books.....at least.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I had bought this book because I was curious as to what Jaycee would say honestly. I had no idea what I was in for. I read the book on my kindle that allowed me to see her private diary entries over the years. What would I say about this book?? I am having my 13 yr old daughter read it. I feel this book should be read by every parent on earth and every young girl on earth. Yes there are parts of this book that most would not want their kids to read. Myself?     I didn't hesitate! Jaycee wrote the truth on what happens or could happen to a young girl on her own on a road just going to school. I want my child to realize that her life could change in an instant and be vigil when she is not with me. So, she bookmarked it tonight and we talked about what she read, other than the comments he should have a big man kick his ass... she said she is hooked. So it's bookmarked half way through the book.     To lady Jay... I am not your mother, aunt of nanna.. What I am is a survivor of sexual abuse my entire life from father to first husband. With that said I can tell you.. you are my moon.. crescent or full.. How you don't hold hate in your life is a miracle within itself. I admire you and wish you the best in your life to come.     I won't tell you like I would a few of my friends i sent the book to , to cherish you children, as you already do. Jaycee if you read these... I applaud your humanity and the ability to keep it after all those years under that monster. I daresay, I can't wait to see what the world holds for you, or rather how you take on the world.       you don't strike me as a woman letting the world lead your way, you will lead the world. Thank you for telling you graphic story for others to read and relate too and even to educate others. If I got one wish in this life it would be to meet you. Inspirational  you are true... I would just like to shake your hand and say thank you.. like you said make them face what they did, offenders, and it's not your shame it'stheirs. Thank you again and again and again for this book!       you have given hopes to many of us who have been hurt by predators, yet nothing like you endured. Leave the hate behind and don't give them the satisfaction of another minute of your time.. am learning to do so  but it will take time... ((( huge hugs)))))    Other prospective buyers of this book... it's should be one of the sins not to. Especially if you have a daughter in your life to keep safe.. highly recommended!
B00518HBD0|4.0|Quick blurb. It's been three years since their last cd and I honestly think it was worth the wait. I don't see how 3DD fans will be disappointed in this one.
B005D63RQK|5.0|Boy, this show sure deserves all the awards which has been heaped upon it.  Without dropping a beat, the show picks up where it leaves off and we get to see what Gus is going to do with Walter and Jesse.  Gus is his usually creepy self, solely focused on the prize of raking in the most money by selling meth.  Fascinating as this all is though, there are two other components we revisit which tug at our heart strings instead of our crime salivating nature.<br /><br />The first is Walter's wife who can't find him and is worried that something terrible has happened.  The scene she puts on with the locksmith with her baby to get him to break into Walt's house is absolutely a gem.  It is a scene which can stand on its own without reference to everything else.<br /><br />The second is former DEA agent Hank, Walter's brother-in-law.  He is in bed at home, bidding on items on ebay and doing nothing else.  He is making very slow progress on improving his mobility from his bullet wounds but a big part of that is his attitude.  He is the worst person to be handicapped in the world as he absolutely has no coping skills. Hank is easily now the most pathetic character on the show, something he himself seems to realize but has no interest in changing.<br /><br />Just a fabulous episode in a fabulous series.
0756404738|5.0|When I reviewed The Name of the Wind I said I was going to wait until book three was announced before reading book two. Obviously that didn't happen.    This installment leaves the first one in the dust as far as size and scope is concerned. It's just shy of 1,000 pages long and while the first book took place primarily at the University, this one begins there but soon expands when Kvothe's ongoing feud with his wealthy and privileged nemesis, Ambrose, comes to a head, forcing him to suspend his studies for a year and try to pursue information about the elusive Chandrian out in the world.    I'm really enjoying how Rothfuss has framed his story. He's done it in a unique and interesting way. On the inside flap of the first book, he has Kvothe describe himself, saying \\"I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings. I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep\\" But when the book begins, we meet Kvothe and he appears in stark contrast to the man he described. He's the owner of a simple tavern about to tell his tale to the King's scribe.     The books consist primarily of that tale, interjected occasionally with \\"real-time\\" chapters that repeatedly remind the reader that the man telling the story has changed drastically since the events that he's describing took place. This second book describes his journey to the courts of the Maer, one of the country's wealthiest men where he uncovers an assassination attempt on the Maer's life. It describes his journey to the land of Fae and his encounter with the mythical Felurian, and it tells of the time he spent with the Adem, an isolated society of well trained fighters who possess what appears to be unnatural speed andagility.    The Wise Man's Fear is fantastic, just as good as the first one. But now, I'm going to have to pay the price for my impatience and will have to wait a couple of years for the last book in the trilogy  to come out and to find out how things conclude.
1440503257|5.0|This cookbook is so fun! I loved the extra information about the foods in regards to history and the Harry Potter series. It looks as though some time was invested in putting together the cookbook. The only thing that could have made this book better would have been pictures. I love it just the same and will be gifting it to one of my other Harry Potter fan friends. Having more cauldron cakes in the morning. Well done!
B003OTLVAW|4.0|This review is for the Japanese SACD version of the disk and focuses on audio quality.      While the price is quite high, I was very happy with this disk.  The music has a pop and snap that is missing from a standard CD.  Given a recording that is over 30 years old and must have been made on analog equipment, the sound is just excellent.  The music emerges from a noiseless background and seems to have limitless depth.  The highs are clear and uncompressed, bass is tight and deep.  It feels like a direct view back to the stereo master tape.      Great music and a top-notch disk.  If you like Dire Straits and enjoy SACD quality, it may be worth your money.
0061784788|5.0|James Rollins has the ability to capture your attention and hold it with a very tenacious grip.  You cannot not read every page!!  Every one of his books is exciting, suspenseful, riviting and thoroughly researched.  His readers, and I am one of them, anxiously await each new book...he's that good!!
B004T0XYM8|5.0|\\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" is a timeless classic. One of the best western's ever! It's pacing can be slow but the tension Sergio Leone is able to create is amazing.
0553801473|2.0|I see that others have already put into words pretty much what I was feeling, so I'll try to keep this review brief.<br /><br />I am a big GRRM fan and I've read all of the Fire & Ice series, as well as some of his other works outside of the Fire & Ice series.  I like his writing style and complexity but for me this book missed the mark.<br /><br />In previous books I felt like Martin wove the multiple viewpoints well and he was able to keep the story moving at a good pace. But for me this book felt disjointed and a lot of it ground on very slowly. Towards the end I thought things were picking up and I got excited to see how he tied up some of the plot threads that I'd been slogging through for 1000 plus pages.  But I was disappointed because at the end there was very little resolution. Almost all of the plot threads were left hanging.  This is probably the only book of this length that I've finished and then thought, \\"That's it?\\"<br /><br />As I said I'm a big GRRM fan and I'll buy his next book too, but I hope that it's better than this one was.
0470932139|5.0|I am so glad that I purchased this book. I have learned so much about styling food, photography and simply using my camera more effectively. I think this book is easy to read and the techniques are easy to understand. I am now a huge fan of Helene's and I appreciate her work. I have gained a much better understanding of how to use my camera and the importance of using good light. I just purchased my first good quality lens after reading this book. The information in the book helped me make a decision about what I needed to achieve the results I want.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I was apprehensive about this book after I learned that the narrator would be a young child.  However, I am so glad that Donoghue made this choice.  Children have a way of seeing things that adults can't seem to comprehend anymore.  Jack gave us more insight into Room than Ma probably could.  Jack lives in isolation with his Ma, but doesn't know any better. Simple items like spoons, rugs, and spider webs become treasured \\"friends\\".  The story takes place in the most horrifying of situations, but through Jack, I could recall special moments in my own childhood where my imagination took over.  I found this book uplifting and inspirational, making me stop to smell the roses.  There's raindrops on my window at the moment and I'm thinking what Jack might have thought of it.  I will be reading this one again someday.
0061726826|1.0|I originally thought this might be a great companion piece for The Giver for students to read...until I saw that this was really just a lame rip-off.  I am really amazed that the publisher allowed such blatant theft of intellectual property.  A lot of reviewers have commented on the beautiful language.  If they are referring to the quickness of the read, I can understand.  The main character attempts to come off as a strong female lead, bit it still falls flat.  Do yourself a favor and read The Giver instead.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|World War Z is a pretty enjoyable, quick read for the most part. It blends everything from political satire to intense action to outright horror to comedy in the many different points of views that make up the \\"oral history\\" of the zombie war. Much of what he covers has been done similarly by shows (The Walking Dead) or movies (pick a Romero movie or Zombieland) but the story is somehow grounded a bit more in reality with his matter-of-fact reporting of these mini-stories. At times the voice he used for each of the oral accounts didn't differentiate itself enough to alleviate some of the tedious nature of those stories, but that didn't happen often and I found myself enjoying 9 out of every 10 accounts I read. (There's probably around 50 accounts or so in the book)<br /><br />It was fairly light on the horror aspect for the most part and most of the book was a retelling of specific actions or events but it was still compelling enough to hold my interest for almost the entire book. I'd recommend this book to just about anyone.
0060936223|5.0|Although aware of the astounding response to this book since its publication, due to my ignorance of Patti Smith and her contributions,I did not read it immediately until now.  In an accident of timing, I was concurrently listening to the audio recording of On The Road, and had there been much separation of time between those two readings, would have missed the similarities and confluences of the two.  Smith's memoir covers her relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe, their early days as \\"just kids\\" in New York, through their associations with the movers and shakers in the worlds of art as well as music.  Smith's talents are huge, her accomplishments too great to enumerate.  She and Mapplethorpe alternated between being one other's muse and artist.  Most of the book is set 40 years ago, in the 70's, over 20 years after the events in Kerouac's masterpiece of artistic questing, but there are similarities in discovery and at least one full fledged point at which these histories coincide -- Alan Ginsberg while at the Chelsea Hotel, Ginsberg, a friend of Kerouac and Neal Cassady and a character in the book, is credited by Smith as being one of her poetic mentors and influences.  The references to Baudelaire and Rimbaud in both books were further ties, influences to both.  It has taken Patti Smith 20 years to fulfill her promise to Robert to tell their story.  It must have been painful as well as joyful to relive those days, but thank heavens she did.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this wonderful production.  There were some scenes in which I felt a \\"living\\" history, although some of the all to realistic (blood & gore) scenes had me turning my head.    I can hardly wait for Gods of the Arena!  Excellent production, and recommend it to everyone!
B004SMDJ9U|4.0|I enjoyed the first season of Haven when it originally aired on SyFy. The story is just as entertaining on DVD, since viewing the episodes back to back makes it easier to see how the clues to the season finale were laid in from the episode one. I also enjoyed the extras.
B000A2RRF4|1.0|First of all, this show is fantastic, especially for a show in the 90's when there were less bells and whistles.  This has everything you would expect to see from a MJ concert.  However, I have some incredible issues with the production.  Allow me to preface this with the fact that I am a camera operator, director, & all things video roadie.  Here's my point.  1) The audio is hideous and I find myself wondering how it got past MJ perfection standards.  They just plopped a mic out in the crowd and recorded the live audio, rather than recording the line audio.    2) WAY TOO MANY crowd shots.  Some are necessary, especially on a dvd to convey the magnitude of the size of the crowd to someone at home that was not able to be there.  However, it is overdone, by about 5 times as much as it should be.  It distracts and forcibly pulls the viewer away from MJ.  3) The director was awful.  He/she continuously took shots of the side screens, with live content and b-roll.  Yup, instead of seeing MJ, we saw a screen see MJ, from a ridiculous side angle.  And yup, instead of dissolving to b-roll content, we see a screen with b-roll content, once again from a ridiculous side angle.  I get that LED walls in the 90s were much rarer than they are now, but for a camera to shoot the side screens is just pointless.    I am a HUGE MJ fan, so I don't want to appear to be critical for the sake of being critical.  However, if you can get your hands on any of the bootlegs out there, give those a try.  I had a hard time giving this 1 star, but being in the industry and knowing how good it could have/should have been with a few simple changes, I couldn't possibly allow my MJ fan bias to unfairly rate this dvd.
015603252X|5.0|It is with a certain, very piquant, sense of humility that I pen this review.  Oz's memoir is so textured, so full of the many layered joys and sorrows of life, anyone's life, that it rather overwhelms the sensitive reader, regardless of how well-read she or he may be.  Whilst certainly tied to Jerusalem in the 1940's-1950's during which he came of age, Oz manages to weave a spell around the reader, all the while maintaining his Chekhovian eye for the particular, that transcends the particular circumstances, that inevitably sparks feelings of d&eacute;j&agrave;-vu and forgotten moments from the reader's own childhood and early adolescence.  I certainly found this to be the case with me.  It is one of the few books that one can say, with complete lack of irony, that it will make you laugh and make you cry, both at the still, sad music of humanity and at its endemic foibles.<br /><br />Everyone will have her/his favourite sections.  One of mine was young Amos's remembrance of his deep, painful crush on his second grade teacher, a poet, who would speak of a child as \\"flooded with light.\\"  Of her, he says, \\"She was my first love.  An unmarried woman in her thirties.  Teacher Zelda, Miss Schneerson.  I was not quite eight, and she swept me away, she set in motion some kind of inner metronome that had not stirred before and has not stopped since.\\"<br /><br />Of course, as other reviewers have noted, the book has a centripetal swirl, towards the eventual suicide of Oz's mother, and a parallel with the Jerusalem setting in what he has reconstructed of her privileged, then persecuted, girlhood in Eastern Europe.  But this does not make the work ultimately tragic. It is another layer in this startlingly written record of one person's sojourn on this Earth, rich and strange as is the life of every person reading this review. A masterpiece.

B001HN694K|5.0|I read Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass as a kid and, of course, watched the Disney version of the movie.  So I know the story.      What Tim Burton has done with this tale is just brilliant.  He's used Jonny Depp's ability to play a heartfelt, wacky character we all are in love with by the end of the movie to perfection, giving the Mad Hatter more depth than Lewis Carroll ever could have imagined.  Grown-up Alice is charming and the queens are, by turns, disturbing and enthralling.  All the favorite characters are present with clever twists to their personalities that could only be envisioned and created by Tim Burton, whose fingerprints are all over it.      This \\"into the future\\" perspective of a familiar old tale is delightful to those familiar with the story as well as those just introduced.  This is a movie my entire family enjoys watching over and over.

1400052181|5.0|I found this book to be absolutely fascinating.  The scientific discovery of HELA and the breakthrough it has provided for scientific research is astounding.  The human aspect of the story is also fascinating, as well as disconcerting.  The manner in which the HELA cells were collected in the first place seems quite unethical today, yet reflects the social attitudes of the time, however shameful they were. One is both touched and confounded by the lack of understanding of Mrs. Lacks' family as to how the cells were used for research, but one is also angered by the manner in which \\"science\\" treated the descendants of Mrs. Lacks.  Ms. Skloot is to be commended for her tenacity and for bringing this story to the public.

B0041KKYBA|5.0|This documentary is required watching for everyone who's ever had a mortgage and been turfed out of their home by the banks.  Show this to all your voting friends especially at election time and keep in mind what's portrayed in this DVD when you're casting your vote. This is a definite eye opener to all the corruption going on in the federal government and clearly shows how Wall St has bought and is controlling your government right to the present day.  Inside Job shows up the hollow promises of Obama who talked big before the election and now he's strangely silent....why?  See for yourself and watch this DVD.
031261246X|1.0|I agree with most of the negative reviews here. Too stereotypical characters & worldview, too simple plot.    The most striking thing to me was the fact that it took the main character Jeff 4 days to attempt to boot a crashed server while it was specifically mentioned by his client that bringing it back online was his top priority. 4 days! Forget all the virus debugging, do that in your own time (clone/replace the drive). Boot the thing, restore from backup, boot again, try an older backup, rebuild from scratch and only restore the data.    I appreciate that Mark Russinovich is a renowned Windows expert, but he clearly did not spend too much time working in IT operations.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|\\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows-Part 2 deals with Harry (played by Daniel Radcliffe) coming to terms with the changing nature of the friendships with the people in his life.  Harry fortunately has many people on his side to help him in the battles with Lord Voldemort.  Lord Voldemort and his entourage try to isolate Harry, but it ends up only helping because of the fact that the movie deals with others joining Harry in the quest for a more peaceful environment.  Emma Watson and Rupert Grint continue to effectively play his two best friends (Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley) that are there to help Harry prevail in restoring harmony to the Hogwarts School.  Many of the actors gave a good performance, but my husband's personal favorite actress was Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange (one of Lord Voldemort's trusted servants).  This is because my husband felt that Helena's character of Bellatrix  gave a great performance as an evil and powerful witch with magical powers that kept Harry Potter on his toes with daring supernatural battles.  I can understand where my husband is coming from regarding Helena's superb acting. However, my personal favorite character of this movie was that of Severus Snape (played by Alan Rickman).  Alan Rickman gave an excellent performance as a wizard that is complex and wise. The movie also gives more information as the origins of Severus Snape's persona, and a visual portrait of a teacher that actually means well for Harry.  \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows-Part 2\\" is recommended for anyone that enjoyed watching any of the other Harry Potter movies and/or fantasy films.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|Maybe this will help combat the idiot 1 stars. this app is listed on the Android martetplace as well.  Under the paid version it has had more than 50,000 - 100,000 downloads. So NO, not a brand new app!!!!  And of those people who have PAID for this app over 5,500 reviews have been posted with an overwhelming  support of 4 1/2 stars. Think that says it all!!    Edit:  Forgot to mention that the developer has a web site that walks you through setting things up and explains all the many things this great app can do!  [...]

I stayed clear from the iPhone and went with the NEW Samsung Infuse....the iphone KILLER......what a phone but that's another story.  I ran across this Radio app here on Amazon and I was skeptical at first even with good reviews, but I just had to download it to try it to see if the ratings were true and that this app could really stream music like it was designed for.  All I can say is.... WOW...WOW....WOW, this app is TOTALY awesome and incredible and can't believe it's FREE....did I says FREE.... folks.  The developer could easily charge for this little puppy! One of the BEST apps I have as it has picked up all my local radio stations with ease!  No install problems or glitches as of now. Simply amazing and fast.  User interface is great too!  This app might not work for everyone but its working for me at the moment and I am very happy. Kudos to the developer...!!!  You are a genius; keep up the great work..!!!
006056251X|5.0|I love all her books, strong, broody flawed, arrogant men, but oh so passionate. The devil in Winter was a winner, unlikely story but in the circumstances believeable, Loved all The Walflower Series, but this one best, I don't know why! it just got to me. so look forward to her next book. To all other readers of Regency Romance, we just love all the wonderful strong men in their tight clothes, strong limbs, lovely faces and naughty looks (and ways) keep them coming, no romance nowadays.    Lisa Kleypas, see her name buy the book
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|My wife and I bought this movie for my 2 year old Daughter. We viewed the movie with our Daughter and thought it was great. The story line was simply but yet intriguing and the characters definitely made the movie. Our daughter loves the movie and can't seem to get enough of it. My Wife and I have seen it several times and enjoy it each and every time; just as our daughter does. We would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who may have young kids; although, our Niece (16 years) and Nephew (10 years) have stated they truly enjoyed it as well.
0553801473|3.0|This book fell well short of expectations. A Game of Thrones is my favorite book (not the series, just the book) because it is written so realistically with great characters with vibrant personalities whose actions made sense within the context of those personalities. Eddard dies because of his honor, Robert dies not caring about governing but hunting for a boar, Sansa lies for Joffery because she is a naive little girl, etc. The characters are real, with real strengths and flaws. Almost all the major players/characters are introduced in the beginning, what with the feast at Winterfell for Robert and then on the way to King's Landing. We got to see all the characters together, so even when they diverge we are bound to their stories by where they came from, by common ground. Enough major events happen to keep us hooked: Bran being thrown by Jamie, Catelyn capturing Tyrion at swordpoint, Eddard being attacked by Jamie, etc. I could go on and on.<br /><br />All the stories were tied together by a common purpose: Westeros. Eddard and the other POV's were about Lannisters trying to control the realm, John Snow's was about defending the realm from the Others, and Daenerys was about regaining the realm. Everything is about the realm. The realm is the most important thing that ties everything together. We care about the realm.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones was tightly written. I do not consider a fantasy book, but a book on political intrigue with a gorgeous backstory (Robert's rebellion) in a fantasy setting. There wasn't overt use of magical powers or mystical creatures. Everything was written in a plausible, easy-to-relate to way in the context of political intrigue that could have happened in medieval Europe. The Others and the Dragons and the witchcraft of the woman who killed Dany's child Rhaego were done tastefully. The overall story and plot and characters carried the book, not the fantasy/magical parts of it. Now, don't get me wrong, I don't dislike fantasy obviously, but everything has changed with Dance.<br /><br />With the way the series has progressed, the fantasy is used way too much. There are so many things to keep track of, so many powers and magical artifacts. The Horn of Winter, Euron's Dragon Hellhorn, the Greenseers, the Weirwoods, Warging, Green Dreams, Dragonglass killing the Others, weird wizards in Qarth and the Undying, Lightbringer and AA, burning and seeing things in the fire from R'Hollar, etc. This is all well and fine, but it completely changes the rules. Basically in Game of Thrones, we are limited to what men can accomplish. Those were the rules of the game of thrones. Now, all those rules are thrown out of whack because we have all these new mechanics. A lot of these things have just been mentioned, not necessarily used, but I feel they take away from the character interaction aspects of the story in Game of Thrones. It would have been better to keep the series somewhat within the normal limits of what medieval men could do but then add a bit of fantasy to lean on. The only thing that should have been a trump card the whole time (due to Targaryen precedent) is the dragons, and they haven't even been used yet.<br /><br />The veering towards more overt fantasy and getting away from the core political intrigue might just be my personal dislike, which is fine. What is not fine, however, and something that many people have already brought up, is the entire lack of coherent plot. I mentioned before that A Game of Thrones was all about the realm. It gave us a single cohesive thing that we care about. Everything flowed and made sense and came back to this central aspect. There was a sequence of events that we clearly saw. For example, Catelyn goes down to King's Landing because she gets the dagger. Littlefinger convinces her it was Tyrion's. Catelyn captures Tyrion. In return, Jamie attacks and wounds Eddard. This is shone through several different character's POV's and flows. Obviously this is one story arc,but so much happens. In Dance, we have the Meereenese story arc. Nothing flows at all. The characters involved are Connington and co, Tyrion, Dany, Barristan, and Quentyn. Connington and co just separate, abandoning Meereen completely. Tyrion goes on his massive adventure of ultimately doing nothing and making it to Meereen as a dwarf entertainer jousting slave who never even meets Dany. I realize he picks up Jorah Mormont and gains perspective from Penny, but seriously this should not take this long. Does Penny actually serve a purpose? Quentyn goes on his own journey, reaches Meereen, and essentially does completely nothing. There is no interesting dialogue between him and Dany or anyone else really, and the only thing he does is free the two dragons. Dany's POV's are basically her being too nice/naïve/little lustful girl and failing as a ruler. All of them. I felt they were extremely repetitive and worse, destroyed the \\"great characters with vibrant personalities whose actions made sense within the context of those personalities\\" aspect of the series. How does she turn into a complete wise-beyond-her-years badass with the strength to lead a broken khalasar who frees Unsullied to a super lustful teenage girl? I don't buy the regression. You can say she's just a girl, she's Sansa with dragons, but that's not true. She was so much stronger and decisive and commanding and she suddenly self-implodes while not moving the plot along whatsoever? Come on.<br /><br />The problem is the events in this story arc don't overlap. You could read one characters POV through and essentially just get their own story. Contrast that with my examples from A Game of Thrones, where each different character's POV built upon each other and moved the story along. Overall, in Dance, there are many things that do not fit and do not tie together cohesively. You randomly get Jamie's chapter with a Brienne cameo, which was awesome, but then nothing happens. You random get a chapter with Aero Hotah to see a glimpse of Doran Martell, which was again awesome, but then nothing happens. These are tremendously written chapters, but what is the point of having them here and then making no mention of them until the next book five years down the line? Arya's chapters are the same thing. These chapters seem like cameos (and are some of my favorites) to let fans read about the characters without actually doing a single thing to progress the plot. There is so much happening everywhere and nothing is related. All of a sudden, I go read about Arya in Braavos to Quentyn on the way to Meereen to Jon on the wall to Jaime in the Riverlands. Nothing ties together or works together the way it did in Game of Thrones. Many characters have tremendously different goals then the realm, which is the thing that tied everything together in the first book. Now we have Dany sitting in Meereen for basically no discernible reason, and many readers have spoken out, \\"we don't care about Essos.\\" You can't start out a series with a focus on the throne in Westeros and then spend such significant time in Essos but accomplish absolutely nothing there.<br /><br />I feel like the series has gotten far away from the tightly woven narrative structure that was so fascinating to read from so many different characters' POV's. Now, we have even more and different characters' POV's, but they each tell different stories that are not inter-woven and are unfocused. It makes it hard to get through when nothing relates to anything else.<br /><br />The book's saving grace is the Northern storyline told mainly through Davos and Theon, with a little bit of Jon. I am not surprised at all these are many people's favorite chapters; it is because they follow the same formula as A Game of Thrones. Davos is \\"killed\\" by Manderly, but he is not and instead must go to Skagos. Huge awesome event that moves the plot. At the same time, we learn that Manderly is still very much committed to the Starks and hates the Freys and Boltons. This information is crucial to reading the later Theon chapters, since we now know exactly where Manderly's loyalties lie. Likewise, Jon sends Mance to Winterfell, and we meet Abel and his spearwives. The banker from the Iron Bank helps Jon, and then is crucial to saving Asha's men and bringing Theon and fake Arya to Stannis. One thing in one character's POV comes up again in the others, giving the story arc continuity and logical flow. This does not happen in the other story arcs, which are essentially just filler. I was honestly bored reading some of it, and that is something I would never have expected in reading this series.<br /><br />I will, of course, be buying and reading every book with just as much fervor as they come out. I hope, however, that the series goes back to the excellent narrative and pacing it began with in A Game of Thrones rather than the (admittedly still good) product we got in Dance.
0756405890|5.0|Loved the first book.  Perfect mix of humor, sarcasam, pain and achievement. Waited impatiently for the second book and was afraid it would not live up to the firsts excellence.  I was not disspapointed! The character development is the perfect mix of detail and insinuation.  The plot kept me guessing and eagerly turning pages. Waiting for the third is painful, but will be worth the wait i'm sure.
B0040YFR1Y|5.0|I am not sure what all the venom is here in the reviews. I own the first Predator, and now will own this one. That's it.  Adrian Brody breaks type and does a great job as a brooding, self-sufficient mercenary. I did not think he could pull it off, but he does.    The rest of the story is original, with plenty of plot twists that you don't necessarily see coming, unlike previous sequels.    I liked the rest of the cast too. You buy into the story line that these are complete strangers thrown into an alien world.    Like all movies, there are a few continuity glitches that should have been ironed out. But overall, this is a deeply satisfying action thriller for those who like aliens, violence and sci-fi.
B00004SAAY|5.0|I love the interpretation, the packaging and everything!     p.s. The entire CD is on Youtube if you want to preview
B001UV4XHY|1.0|prepare yourself for endless advertisements before you can even get to the play menu...I realize they have to make money from promotion but this was absolutely ridiculous....
0002247402|2.0|***Read the whole review before commenting or starring please. Don't form an opinion of my review just by reading my opening line***<br /><br />This book is a steaming pile of Mammoth dung compared to the first 3, plain and simple. It's comparable to AFFC, but worse. In my opinion, up until now AFFC had been the worst book in the series. ADWD now takes those honors.<br /><br />How many hundreds of pages do we need to read about people traveling somewhere, or what characters are thinking in their head? Obviously we need more from George about what happens once we get there and less about the journey there. I found myself skimming regularly due to the fact that about 80% of this book is completely boring. I enjoyed the dialog between characters very much (everything in quotes), but that's about it. After I was about 60% through the book I noticed myself only reading the dialog simply because reading everything on the page angered me due to the obvious fact that I knew this book was going nowhere fast, and if I read both dialog and non-dialog it went nowhere even faster. I couldn't count on 100 hands the number of times I SHOUTED OUT LOUD, \\"JUST F***ing get on with it (the story), and spare me the meaningless details. THIS BOOK IS LIKE A CHEAP CIGAR, 90% FILER.<br /><br />The POVs from the Ironborn (minus Asha & Theon)are the worst, and Arya's training (in this book, not so much the last) is just dragging on and on. Most chapters that include any of the \\"free companies\\" are also stinkers too. I can't believe we had to wait six years for this chamberpot full of waste. I am glad that GRRM does not live in my state, else I would be tempted to seek him out and smack him a few times. His ego is now the size of Paxter Redwyne's fleet, and for what? This is turd number two that GRRM has deposited into the SOIF pot, and its no wonder why. All anyone has to do is read his blog to see that Comic-con, SOIF figurines and other stupid things mean more to him than his writing thesedays. From his blog you can see that he does very little writing, and very much everything else. Either he has lost his talent, or he just doesn't care anymore... There are no other explanations.<br /><br />This is a serious review, and not a GRRM hit article. I used to love George's writing more than I loved myself. After high school I didn't really read books anymore (unless they were college related), after 20 years it was GRRM that re-ignited my passion for reading with the first 3 books of SOIF. Because of him I have read hundreds of High Fantasy books over the last five years, with so much love that most books I finish in less than 3 days regardless of the number of pages. He WAS by far my favorite author, but now after the last two SOIF books he has dropped to #3 or #4 on my list. I am glad that I did not buy this and chose to secure and read it with alternative methods. I will not buy his next book either, but if I see that he has gotten back to form I will perhaps buy the last one, book #7 (at this rate, with the amount of filler he is now injecting I would not be surprised to see the series bloat to 10 books).<br /><br />The \\"OFFICIAL\\" media reviews, such as The Times, etc are full of crap. In fact the Times review was done by a friend of his, a fellow author. Now I ask you, would one author badmouth another publicly about his work ? OF COURSE NOT, that author knows that at some time he/she will also have a book out and would fear public reprisals.<br />Authors frequently kiss each others butts. Read all the reviews here on amazon from people who ACTUALLY PAID FOR the book, and its clear that he has disappointed around 85-90% of his fans with this book.<br /><br />For those who were satisfied with this book, there is no need to read on.<br /><br />For ALL THOSE who are DISAPPOINTED with the Last 2 books of SOIF, and for those who are now reading all these negative reviews on amazon who are deciding NOT to buy the book I am including some recommendations for good High Fantasy reading that is similar and without filler to SOIF and GRRM. ***(NOTE I DIDN'T SAY THE SAME CALIBER! Obviously SOIF is one of the Greatest Epics of our time!!!)<br /><br />-ROBIN HOBB (my new favorite writer, who never uses filler): SOLDIER SON TRILOGY, THE FARSEER TRILOGY, MAD SHIP  TRILOGY, TAWNY MAN TRILOGY.<br />-DAVID FARLAND: THE RUNELORDS (8 books so far, all amazing AND NO FILLER)<br />-NAOMI NOVIK: The TEMERAIRE SERIES (7 books so far, amazing combination of actual history and high fantasy, NO  FILLER... a MUST if you love dragons)<br /><br />Stay Away from: Robert Jordan (Wheel of No Editor hahah), James Mallory, and Mercedes Lackey. /end rant
B004XJHBCE|1.0|This app doesn't do anything new for your android device.  If you are merely looking for some organization in adw/launcher pro you can always get the simifolder app and add a folder to your home screen or launcher bar.  Should be free on the market place. One star review to help bring the rating down where it should be.  Developers should be penalized for all the fake reviews on the app of the day.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|A lot of apps seem to replicate about the same what stock apps do. I wouldn't keep an app if improvements are incrimental. This is one of the few apps that improves on the old Android organizing so well, that it becomes a keeper.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|I purchased this app several weeks ago.  It is a must-have for anyone who loads a large number of apps on their phone.  I'm stunned that we're up to version 3.1 of Android and it still doesn't have built-in folder support or app labeling.  The Folder Organizer app solves both issues.  It allowed me to consolidate from 5 home screens full of icons down to just 2 well-organized screens.  To those marking down to 1 or 2 stars due to poor instructions... come on, give me a break.  This is by far one of the most useful apps on the entire OS, and it really isn't very hard to figure out - took me less than 5 minutes.  I'm sorry your attention span can only be measured in nanoseconds.
B004Y1USJE|5.0|I got my new Yes album in the mail from Amazon yesterday and it was worth the wait.  I am a diehard progressive rock fan and this is one of the best yes albums I heard in a long time. There is never a dull sound on this album from beginning to end. It has a 70's sound to it, and Yes has never disapointed in a album. I love this album and will be a great addition to my collection of Yes CD's. Every song is great on this album, and if you a Yes fan like I am, you will enjoy this album. get this right away!
B003UESJH4|5.0|My husband and I were lucky enough to enjoying seeing this fine film in a theatre near our home in Virginia.    Not all of our friends and contemporaries (retired and over 70) still enjoy the luxury of driving to a \\"movie house\\" any more.  They haven't mastered downloading movies for home viewing from their their cable or satellite  TV systems, and video rental stores are closing right and left.  And it's harder and harder for them to keep up with new movies.    Especially new movies like this one that rather proper people over 70 can watch without covering their ears or eyes to shut out X-rated language and action.    One such couple recently celebrated their golden anniversary (I was a bridesmaid in 1961).    So this DVD of The King's Speech was a perfect anniversary gift and one that our friends thoroughly enjoyed.  Indeed, they're now busily lending it to all of their friends and relatives in the Upstate New York community where we all grew up.    It's become a gift that keeps on giving.
B0013811CE|4.0|Great show, but why are the curse words and nipples bleeped and blurred? It's not like the interwebs have FCC network rules about such things. As an adult, feel a little cheated, having bought the season. Why? Oh, why?<br /><br />One star off for the bleeps n' blurs that rather take me out of the story.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|This purchase was a tv series video called \\"The Pacific\\". There was nothing wrong with the DVDs and I received it very quickly from LIFE. If the opportunity presents itself again, I will order from this seller again.[[ASIN:B001IBIHQ4 The Pacific (HBO Miniseries)]]
0553801473|4.0|I have enjoyed all of GRRM's books, including this one.  I read it in two sittings.  It entertained me, but as some other reviewers have stated - there was quite a lot of \\"fluff\\" here and there.  I was also frustrated with the way something things (most things) didn't progress in a timely manner, as the previous poster had said - particularly with Dany and the Dragons.  I did love how Dany and Drogon got a lot of attention, but I do think there should have been more Cersei and Jamie.  All in all, I enjoyed it, and now I'm stuck waiting for the next book - when is it coming out? lol
B00005UEAR|5.0|\\"Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence\\" is Dream Theater's 10th album. Turns out that this album is actually Dream Theater's first studio album to actually span over 2 discs. The album proves, once again, that Dream Theater is one of the best progressive rock / metal bands out there.    DISC ONE    \\"THE GLASS PRISON\\": I. REFLECTION / II. RESTORATION / III. REVELATION    This track marks the first entry in (Drummer) Mike Portnoy's Twelve-Step-Suite, in which he explains the twelve steps to his recovery from alcoholism. I. \\"Reflection\\", II. \\"Restoration\\", & III. \\"Revelation\\", the 3 parts that make up this song, are actually the first 3 steps. This is a classic song, a song that I take to heart, due to its important message.    \\"BLIND FAITH\\"    What an amazing tune. I could listen to this over and over again.    \\"MISUNDERSTOOD\\"    Awesome.    \\"THE GREAT DEBATE\\"    An amazing song.    \\"DISAPPEAR\\"    Incredible. So incredible that words cannot describe it.    DISC TWO    \\"SIX DEGREES OF INNER TURBULENCE\\": I. OVERTURE / II. ABOUT TO CRASH / III. WAR INSIDE MY HEAD / IV. THE TEST THAT STUMPED THEM ALL / V. GOODNIGHT KISS / VI. SOLITARY SHELL / VII. ABOUT TO CRASH (REPRISE) / VIII. LOSING TIME - GRAND FINALE    This here is the album's infamous \\"Epic\\" title track, and Dream Theater's, by far, longest song, clocking in at an honest-to-God 42:04. The song, which has 8 portions to it, is actually broken into 8 tracks. Let me tell you all right now that this song is in-freaking-credible. I, seriously, cannot find the right words to describe how amazing it is. I don't think I'll ever be able to describe how awesome this song really is.    The entire song talks about 6 different people (hense the title, \\"Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence\\"), who each suffer from a form of mental illness.     I. \\"Overture\\" serves as the song's instrumental introduction, and what an amazing intro it is. This would be TRACK #1 for DISC #2.    II. \\"About To Crash\\" talks about a young girl suffering from \\"Bipolar Disorder\\". The lyrics suggest that this part of the song is being told from the point of view of, either, the girl's father, or the girl's boyfriend. Tjis would be TRACK #2  for DISC #2.    III. \\"War Inside My Head\\" talks about man, who had fought in Vietnam, many years ago, and is now suffering from \\"Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder\\". With this illness, the man in the story believes he is still out in Vietnam. This would be TRACK #3  for DISC #2.    IV. \\"The Test That Stumped Them All\\" talks about a man, who suffers from \\"Schizophrenia\\". The doctors in this story discover that there is no cure for \\"Schizophrenia\\" and that there is little information out there. This would be TRACK #4 for DISC #2.    V. \\"Goodnight Kiss\\" talks about a woman, who has lost her child, in some way or form, and is, now, suffering from \\"Post-Partum Depression\\". It becomes somewhat apparent that her child has been hospitalized, or may have passed away at birth. This would be TRACK #5 for DISC #2.    VI. \\"Solitary Shell\\" tells of a young man suffering from \\"Autism\\". The story reveals that he had started off quite normal. But some years later, he had become, suddenly, withdrawn from all social contact. This would be TRACK #6 for DISC #2.    VII. \\"About To Crash\\" (Reprise) goes back to our first patient: the young girl, who suffers from \\"Bipolar Disorder\\". Only, this time, this part of her story is being given from the patient's point of view. This would be TRACK #7 for DISC #2.    VIII. \\"Losing Time\\" / \\"Grand Finale\\" ... The first part of this story, \\"Losing Time\\", tells of a girl suffering from \\"Dissociative Identity Disorder\\", previously known as \\"Multiple Personality Disorder\\". It explains that she has little to no friends, most likely due to this girl having multiple personalities throughout her life. This disorder causes the girl to have a result of amnesia, where she cannot keep track of her life among her many personalities, hence the title, \\"Losing Time\\". \\"The Grand Finale\\", which isthe second part of this story, informs us that we have to be more understanding of all people, who suffer from these disorders, and not to be heartless towards them, while also giving a short overview of each disorder. This would be TRACK #8 for DISC #2.       This whole album, as I have stated, is simply amazing. I have also mentioned that Dream Theater has become quite known for their lengthy \\"Epic\\" songs. \\"A MIND BESIDE ITSELF\\" (despite being split into 3 tracks) clocks in at 20:26. \\"A CHANGE OF SEASONS\\" clocks in at 23:06. With this album, \\"Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence\\" (despite being split into 8 tracks) clocks in at a lengthy 42:04. If you are a Dream Theater fan, then you have to have this album in your collection, especially if you are a hardcore fan.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|this is a great program especially in conjunction with Launcher X Pro. I would recommend getting them both. bps black bps 20 words is stupid blah blah blah
B0000CDLA7|5.0|For Dream Theater's 11th album, \\"Train Of Thought\\", Dream Theater decided that, while keeping their classic \\"Dream Theater\\" progressive sound & style, they were going to go in a more classic heavy metal style. I knew I was going to like this one when my buddy gave me a copy of it. But I had no idea I was going to like as much as I do. The album is just incredible, and, if you ask me, it gets better with each time I hear it.    \\"AS I AM\\"    This track actually starts off with the final chord heard at the very end of the title track of \\"Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence\\". Very cool and interesting, if you ask me. According to Wikipedia.com, some this song's lyrics were inspired by Dream Theater's Summer tour, that took place in 2003, where they toured with Queensryche (another awesome band). Wikipedia states that (Drummer) Mike Portnoy described those shows as an \\"irksome series of shows\\". According to Wikipedia.com and (Drummer) Mike Portnoy, Mike Stone (who is the guitarist for Queensryche) tried to give (Guitarist) John Petrucci tips on guitar playing. This, ultimately led John into writing some the lyrics to this song. Hearing this story had made me like this song even more. This is an awesome tune.    \\"THIS DYING SOUL\\": IV. REFLECTIONS OF REALITY (REVISITED) / V. RELEASE    This song is the 2nd entry in (Drummer) Mike Portnoy's Twelve-Step Suite. This song has only 2 parts, but those 2 parts are actually Steps 4 & 5 in Mike's 12 Steps to Recovery. Another awesome track.    \\"ENDLESS SACRIFICE\\"    Another great song.    \\"HONOR THY FATHER\\"    This track was actually written by (Drummer) Mike Portnoy, about his stepfather. According to the information I have read, when Mike was asked about what had inspired him to write this song, he replied that he's not very good at writing love songs, and this led him into writing a \\"Hate\\" song. Awesome, awesome song. NOTE: This is the 2nd of 2 Dream Theater songs to feature the word, \\"F---\\".    \\"VACANT\\"    This beautiful track waswritten by (Vocalist) James LaBrie. His inspiration for this song came from his daughter, Chloe, who had fallen into a short coma, due to an unexplained seizure 3 days before her 7th birthday.    \\"STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS\\"    Another brilliant instrumental track. This instrumental piece is, by far, Dream Theater's longest running instrumental track.    \\"IN THE NAME OF GOD\\"    An awesome way to end this incredible album.    This album is too great to not have in your collection, that is if you are a hardcore fan of Dream Theater.
B0039P1O4O|5.0|Ive used quite a number of Bluetooth and other handsfree and this is the best ever. Clear speaker and Mic and long talk time a very long standby time.
B000G7PMD2|5.0|April 1, 2006 marked the end of Dream Theater's \\"20th Anniversary Tour\\", where they played in New York City at Radio City Music Hall. The tour was to, not only support their 2005 album, \\"Octavarium\\", but was also to celebrate their first 20 years performing as a band.    As if performing their final show on their 20th Anniversary Tour wasn't enough of a celebration of 20 years of performing as a band together, they took the celebration one step further by recording their final concert (\\"final concert\\" as in the final concert at that particular tour) for a live DVD release, and ... a live CD release. This live CD, in which is appropriately titled, \\"Score\\", is their 5th live CD (14th, overall), and it is, once again, without a single doubt, unbelievably awesome.    DISC ONE    \\"THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL\\": VI. READY / VII. REMOVE    Original version from \\"Octavarium\\" (2005). What an awesome performance.    \\"I WALK BESIDE YOU\\"    Original version from \\"Octavarium\\" (2005). Just an incredible performance.    \\"ANOTHER WON\\"    This particular song is an album cut. But from which album it is cut, I have no idea. But, regardless, this song is just awesome. Loved every minute of it.    \\"AFTERLIFE\\"    Original version from \\"When Dream And Day Unite\\" (1989). Still an awesome song.     \\"UNDER A GLASS MOON\\"    Original version from \\"Images And Words\\" (1992). I already loved this song when I first heard the studio version of this song. After hearing this performance of it, I loved the song even more.    \\"INNOCENCE FADED\\"    Original version from \\"Awake\\" (1994). Still an awesome song. Loved hearing this live performance.    \\"RAISE THE KNIFE\\"    This song was actually an album cut from the \\"Falling Into Infinity\\" recording sessions. I really wish Dream Theater were allowed to included this song on that album because this song kicks major a**.    \\"SCENE EIGHT: THE SPIRIT CARRIES ON\\"    Original version from \\"Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes From A Memory\\" (1999). An amazing performance from one ofmy favorite Dream Theater songs. I wish Theresa Thomason could've been there, though.    DISC TWO    \\"SIX DEGREES OF INNER TURBULENCE\\": I. OVERTURE / II. ABOUT TO CRASH / III. WAR INSIDE MY HEAD / IV. THE TEST THAT STUMPED THEM ALL / V. GOODNIGHT KISS / VI. SOLITARY SHELL / VII. ABOUT TO CRASH (REPRISE) / VIII. LOSING TIME - GRAND FINALE    Original version from \\"Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence\\" (2002). As I have mentioned before, this song is definitely among my favorites of Dream Theater, and the fact that they performed this song, in its entirety, is just amazing. NOTE: The studio version of this song was split into 8 tracks, but this live performance is all on one track.    \\"VACANT\\"    Original version from \\"Train Of Thought\\" (2003). Such a beautiful, not to mention, heartfelt, song.    \\"THE ANSWER LIES WITHIN\\"    Original version from \\"Octavarium\\" (2005). Still a song that I hold very close to my heart, as it is a personal favorite of mine.    \\"SACRIFICED SONS\\"    Original version from \\"Octavarium\\" (2005). Loved every minute of this performance.    DISC THREE    \\"OCTAVARIUM\\": I. SOMEONE LIKE HIM / II. MEDICATE (AWAKENING) / III. FULL CIRCLE / IV. INTERVALS / V. RAZOR'S EDGE    Original version from \\"Octavarium\\" (2005). Hearing another \\"Epic\\" performed live in its entirety makes my day even better.    \\"METROPOLIS PT. 1: THE MIRACLE AND THE SLEEPER\\"    Original version from \\"Images And Words\\" (1992). Still an awesome song.    This CD release, not to mention the DVD release, was the best way for Dream Theater to celebrate their first 20 years as a band. I know that it is safe to say that Dream Theater will be around for a long, long time.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|This movie gave the backstory of Wolverine.  I found it interesting and it answered some of the questions about how he came to be who he is. It has plenty of action, but also heart.  However, to be honest, I like all the X-Men movies a lot so I may be prejudiced!
B000LX29XM|5.0|\\"Live Scenes From New York\\" is Dream Theater's 3rd live album (ninth album overall), and it is no ordinary live album. It is a live album (which spans over 3 discs) that has Dream Theater playing an entire album from start to finish, during the first half of their show, along with 8 other songs to fill out the second half of their show.     \\"Live Scenes From New York\\" was recorded at the Roseland Ballroom in New York City on August 30, 2000, during their 2000 \\"Metropolis 2000\\" World Tour, which is why the first half of this show features Dream Theater performing the \\"Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes From A Memory\\" album in its entirety. This live album turned out to be completely outstanding.    DISC ONE:    \\"SCENE ONE\\": REGRESSION    Original version from \\"Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes From A Memory\\" (1999). Awesome performance.    \\"SCENE TWO\\": I. OVERTURE 1928    Original version from \\"Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes From A Memory\\" (1999). Another awesome performance.    \\"SCENE TWO\\": II. STRANGE DEJA VU    Original version from \\"Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes From A Memory\\" (1999). Incredible.    \\"SCENE THREE\\": I. THROUGH MY WORDS    Original version from \\"Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes From A Memory\\" (1999). Outstanding performance.    \\"SCENE THREE\\": II. FATAL TRAGEDY    Original version from \\"Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes From A Memory\\" (1999). Amazing.    \\"SCENE FOUR\\": BEYOND THIS LIFE    Original version from \\"Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes From A Memory\\" (1999). Words can't describe this performance.    \\"JOHN & THERESA SOLO SPOT\\"    John Petrucci in one corner. Theresa Thomason in the second corner. Somebody please explain to me just how awesome this solo spot is between John Petrucci playing an awesome solo on his guitar, with Theresa displaying her powerful voice.    \\"SCENE FIVE\\": THROUGH HER EYES    Original version from \\"Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes From A Memory\\" (1999). Another awesome performance.    \\"SCENE SIX\\": HOME    Original version from \\"Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes From A Memory\\" (1999). Amazing, once again.    \\"SCENE SEVEN\\": I. THE DANCE OF ETERNITY    Original version from \\"Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes From A Memory\\" (1999). Once again, amazing.    DISC TWO:    \\"SCENE SEVEN\\": II. ONE LAST TIME    Original version from \\"Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes From A Memory\\" (1999). Once again, amazing.    \\"SCENE EIGHT\\": THE SPIRIT CARRIES ON    Original version from \\"Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes From A Memory\\" (1999). An outstanding performance of my favorite song from \\"Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes From A Memory\\". Theresa, herself, even gets to sing the \\"bridge\\" of this song during this performance.    \\"SCENE NINE\\": FINALLY FREE    Original version from \\"Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes From A Memory\\" (1999). Awesome.    \\"METROPOLIS PT. 1: THE MIRACLE AND THE SLEEPER\\"    Original version from \\"Images And Words\\" (1992). Performing the predecessor to \\"Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes From A Memory\\". Now, how awesome is that?    \\"THE MIRROR\\"    Original version from \\"Awake\\" (1994). Awesome performance.    \\"JUST LET ME BREATHE\\"    Original version from \\"Falling Into Infinity\\" (1997). Awesome.    \\"ACID RAIN\\"    Original version from the original Liquid Tension Experiment album, \\"LIQUID TENSION EXPERIMENT 2\\" (1999). As you may have read, this song was originally performed by Liquid Tension Experiment, which was a side band featuring Dream Theater's Mike Portnoy on Drums, John Petrucci on Guitars, and Jordan Rudess on Keyboards. Awesome performance, especially since, this time round, it is Dream Theater performing it.    \\"CAUGHT IN A NEW MILLENNIUM\\"    Original version from the album \\"Falling Into Infinity\\" (1997). Awesome performance.    \\"ANOTHER DAY\\"    Original version from \\"Images And Words\\" (1992). Awesome album.    \\"JORDAN RUDESS KEYBOARD SOLO\\"    Jordan finally gets his chance to show Dream Theater fans what he can really do. Kevin Moore and Derek Sherinian are both awesome keyboardists. I'd be lying if I said they were horrible. But Jordan, without a doubt, is the Keyboard Master ... The Wizard,if you will. He most certainly deserves to be in this band.    DISC THREE    \\"A MIND BESIDE ITSELF\\": I. EROTOMANIA    Original version from \\"Awake\\" (1994). Awesome performance.    \\"A MIND BESIDE ITSELF\\": II. VOICES    Original version from \\"Awake\\" (1994). Once again, awesome. Just awesome.    \\"A MIND BESIDE ITSELF\\": III. THE SILENT MAN    Original version from \\"Awake\\" (1994). Awesome. Hearing Dream Theater perform \\"A Mind Beside Itself\\" live in its entirety is definitely awesome.    \\"LEARNING TO LIVE\\"    Original version from \\"Images And Words\\" (1992). Downright incredible performance.    \\"A CHANGE OF SEASONS\\": I. THE CRIMSON SUNRISE / II. INNOCENCE / III. CARPE DIEM / IV. THE DARKEST OF WINTERS / V. ANOTHER WORLD / VI. THE INEVITABLE SUMMER / VII. THE CRIMSON SUNSET    Original version from \\"A Change Of Seasons\\" (1995). Awesome performance. It's always best to hear this song performed in its entirety.    What an album this turned out to be. I couldn't have asked for a better live album this one right here. This just goes to show you how much talent Dream Theater really has.    NOTE: This album, coincidentally, was released on September 11, 2001. The albums front image, which you are looking at, was the album's original artwork. After the tragic events of 9/11 happened, Dream Theater pulled the album, deleted the image of the New York skyline, and re-released the album to avoid any controversy, as it was pure coincidence.
B004SIP8JI|5.0|This movie is on a par with You've Got Mail, Sleepless in Seattle, and While You Were Sleeping.  Hugh Jackman is totally excellent as the time-traveler - also  he's the perfect man in this movie which should appeal to most women!  It's great.
B000021XS0|5.0|\\"Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes From A Memory\\" is Dream Theater's eighth album. It is also an instant masterpiece.    An interesting thing about this album is that during the recording sessions for 1997's \\"Falling Into Infinity\\", Dream Theater had written a 20+ minuite sequel to \\"Metropolis Pt. 1: The Miracle And The Sleeper\\". That sequel was, obviously, \\"Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes From A Memory\\". But the producer that was working with Dream Theater during the \\"Falling Into Infinity\\" sessions deemed the track too long to include, as \\"Falling Into Infinity\\" would've been a double album. Ever since then, Dream Theater decided that they would work with outside producers no more. (Guitarist) John Petrucci and (Drummer) Mike Portnoy would go on to self-produce the albums themselves, starting with this album.     They resumed working on \\"Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes From A Memory\\", where they decided to break it up into nine different songs, where the album would become a concept album.     The album's story is what makes the album more awesome than it already is. It tells the story of a young man named Nicholas. Nicholas is having this recurring dream about a young girl named Victoria Page, who was shot and killed in 1928. To figure out what this dream means, Nicholas goes to a hypnotherapist. While under hypnosis, Nicholas discovers that HE was Victoria Page in a past life, and that his recurring dream is ACTUALLY a past life memory.     Now, what I just described is the basic jidst of the story. Any and all details were left out, which means you will have to listen to the whole album to put the details together, piecing the whole story together for yourselves.    \\"SCENE ONE\\": REGRESSION    The best way to start off this album. I can't think of any other way to start of this album that is better than this opening track.    \\"SCENE TWO\\": I. OVERTURE 1928    Awesome.    \\"SCENE TWO\\": II. STRANGE DEJA VU    The best way to end \\"Scene Two\\".    \\"SCENE THREE\\": I. THROUGH MY WORDS    Amazing.    \\"SCENE THREE\\": II. FATAL TRAGEDY    Incredible.    \\"SCENE FOUR\\": BEYOND THIS LIFE    Loved every minute of this track.    \\"SCENE FIVE\\": THROUGH HER EYES    An awesome track, featuring additional vocals by gospel singer Theresa Thomason. Theresa has such a beautiful voice and it should be noted that she most definitely deserved to weave her voice right next to James' incredible voice.    \\"SCENE SIX\\": HOME    Awesome.    \\"SCENE SEVEN\\": I. THE DANCE OF ETERNITY    Awesme way to start off \\"Scene Seven\\".    \\"SCENE SEVEN\\": II. ONE LAST TIME    Incredible, once again.    \\"SCENE EIGHT\\": THE SPIRIT CARRIES ON    My favorite song from this album. Once again, Theresa Thomason gets to weave her beautiful voice next to James' awesome voice.    \\"SCENE NINE\\": FINALLY FREE    Incredible way to end this album.    This album, as I said before, is a brilliant masterpiece. It is definitely another one of my favorite Dream Theater albums.    NOTE: This album marks the first album to feature Dream Theater's third keyboardist ... Jordan Rudess, the keyboard wizard.     Jordan was originally asked to join Dream Theater back in 1994, as a replacement for Kevin Moore. He passed the audition with flying colors, but Jordan ultimately decided to tour with The Dixie Dreggs instead, due to the flexibility. That is actually how Derek Sherinian became Kevin Moore's replacement.    In 1997 or 1998, when Mike Portnoy, through the request of Magna Carta Records, was finally able to get his side band, LIQUID TENSION EXPERIMENT, off the ground. Mike brought in bassist Tony Levin, Jordan Rudess (to, obviously, play keyboards), and fellow Dream Theater pal, John Petrucci to play guitars.     After playing with Jordan for a year, John P., and Mike asked Jordan, for a second time, if he wanted to join Dream Theater. He accepted, where Dream Theater had to let Derek go, to make way for Jordan. Derek claims that, although sad at first at their decision, he said it was for the best, as he got a chance toembark on a solo career, as well as form his own band, PLANET X. Derek also claims (according to what I have read) that he is still good friends with Dream Theater.
B00000I14Z|5.0|This album should be right up there with the other great jazz albums of all time (e.g., Kind of Blue, Monk's Music, Giant Steps, etc).
B0009A1AS2|5.0|It seems to me that for their 13th album, Dream Theater wanted to record a \\"Classic Dream Theater\\" album, and that's what they most certainly did, with \\"Octavarium\\". Once again, I cannot find the right words to describe this album's awesomeness.    \\"THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL\\": VI. READY / VII. REMOVE    This is the 3rd entry in Mike Portnoy's 12-Step Suite, this time featuring Steps 6 & 7 of the 12 Steps to Recovery from Alcoholism. This is another awesome entry.    \\"THE ANSWER LIES WITHIN\\"    This is another one of my personal favorites, as I hold it very close to my heart. Just an amazing song. The lyrics. The Drumming. The Bass. The Guitars. The Keyboards. The Vocals & Harmonies. It all brings a tear to my eye.    \\"THESE WALLS\\"    Awesome. Just ... awesome. Can't describe it.    \\"I WALK BESIDE YOU\\"    Another amazing song.    \\"PANIC ATTACK\\"    Just amazing.    \\"NEVER ENOUGH\\"    This song was written by (Drummer) Mike Portnoy, in response to the unhappiness of some fans. A lot of fans would usually display disappointment if Dream Theater played a concert or two, where they did not perform \\"Pull Me Under\\" (just to use an example), and this was Mike's way of saying that no matter what he, and the rest of Dream Theater, does for the fans, it never seems to be enough. This is an awesome song.    \\"SACRIFICED SONS\\"    This song was written by (Vocalist) James LaBrie, in which it deals with the events of September 11, 2001. Just an amazing song.    \\"OCTAVARIUM\\": I. SOMEONE LIKE HIM / II. MEDICATE (AWAKENING) / III. FULL CIRCLE / IV. INTERVALS / V. RAZOR'S EDGE    This is another one of my all-time favorite \\"Epic\\" songs, where this one clocks in at an even 24:00, and is all on one track. The story behind this song is just purely amazing:    I. \\"Someone Like Him\\"    This part of the song tells of a man who decides on he wants to do in his life, not wanting to become an ordinary person. He succeeds in getting the extraordinary life he's always wanted. Soon after he gets the lifehe wants, he winds reflecting on it, and realizes that he really did not want to become successful, rather wanting to become an ordinary person after all. This song also displays the album's overall theme of everything coming full circle: Ending up where you originally began.    II. \\"Medicate (Awakening)\\"    In this part of the song, a man wakes up in a hospital and finds a doctor sitting at his bedside. This doctor informs the man that he had been in a catatonic sleep for, believe it or not, 30 years. The doctor is convinced that this man is cured. Suddenly, the patient is in extreme need of help, as he begins to feel that his consciousness is fading. The doctor tries everything he can, including prescribing a higher dosage of his medication, but it will not help. Despite the doctor's apparent failure, the patient informs the doctor that he is not at fault, and that he should not be ashamed. Soon after, the patient slips back into unconsciousness. Once again, the album's \\"Full Circle\\" theme is evident here.    III. \\"Full Circle\\"    This part of the song is actually (Drummer) Mike Portnoy's homage to the progressive rock scene. The lyrics in this part of the song display several references to his favorite songs, bands, and many others.    IV. \\"Intervals\\"    This part of the song is pretty much an overview of the album's songlist. Before each stanza in this part of the song's lyrics, (Drummer) Mike Portnoy says a scale degree.     V. \\"Razor's Edge\\"    This is the final part of the song, where it clearly emphasizes the cyclical nature of all things, especially where it ends.    This entire album was just way to awesome for me to describe. It has become another one of my all-time favorite Dream Theater albums. It is an album that everyone must have.
B000002HPT|5.0|1997 saw the released of Dream Theater's sixth album, \\"Falling Into Infinity\\". Dream Theater really has a knack for releasing incredible albums, and this album is, in no shape, way, or form, an exception.     \\"NEW MILLENNIUM\\"    What an amazing opening track.    \\"YOU NOT ME\\"    Loved every minute of this song. NOTE: This song was originally written and recorded as \\"You Or Me\\", but Dream Theater's producer (at least from the information I had read) brought in Desmond Child to re-write half of this song's lyrics, changed the title from \\"You Or Me\\" to \\"You Not Me\\", and had Dream Theater re-record it. As awesome as this track is, the original \\"You Or Me\\" is definitely better ... at least in my opinion. But, as I said, this track is definitely awesome.    \\"PERUVIAN SKIES\\"    Awesome track.    \\"HOLLOW YEARS\\"    What an amazing song. Everything about this song is very uplifting: James' voice, the lyrics, the music provided by John M., John P., Derek, & Mike. Awesome song.    \\"BURNING MY SOUL\\"    Another song I could listen to all day long. Awesome track.    \\"HELL'S KITCHEN\\"    This song is extremely easy for me to rock out to.    \\"LINES IN THE SAND\\"    Awesome song, featuring special guest vocalist, Doug Pinnick (bassist & lead vocalist for King's X).    \\"TAKE AWAY MY PAIN\\"    Another amazing song. This song was written by John Petrucci (as many of Dream Theater's songs are), and it was written about his dad. Simply amazing.    \\"JUST LET ME BREATHE\\"    Awesome.    \\"ANNA LEE\\"    Now, when I heard this whole album, I was already amazed at how incredible it was. But when I heard this track, I was blown away. The song is beautifully amazing. This track was actually written by lead vocalist, James LaBrie, who had written a few of Dream Theater's songs (i.e. \\"Sacrificed Sons\\", \\"Prophets Of War\\", etc.)    \\"TRIAL OF TEARS\\": I. IT'S RAINING / II. DEEP IN HEAVEN / III. THE WASTELAND    What an awesome \\"Epic\\" track, clocking in at 13:07. Another song I can't get enough of.    This isan album for all Dream Theater fans, no exceptions. \\"Falling Into Infinity\\" is definitely one of their greatest albums, in my opinion.
0553573403|5.0|I read a lot of fantasy.  I usually tend to stay away from the big names in the fantasy genre.  Tolkein was a bit of a bore - though I suppose it might have been a different story if I bothered to read Lord of the Rings before the movies came out.  Likewise, I gave Robert Jordan a try and lost interest about halfway through book one of Wheel of Time.  Somehow a month ago I ended up stumbling upon George R.R. Martin, who I'd heard a lot about and finally decided to give him a shot.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones puts to shame every other fantasy book I have in my collection.<br /><br />This is a book that feels real; it feels like the story is one that could actually happen.  It's a bit like reading several books at once.  Gone is the cookie cutter, \\"Good vs Evil\\" archetype that so many fantasy books fall back on.  Everyone has their flaws, no body is perfect, and like real life, often times the difference between right and wrong is all a matter of perspective.  There are so many different story lines intertwined and all of them are relevant and interesting.  And there's a lot of suspense, unlike many other fantasy stories where the good guys always prevail.  In the world that Martin creates, anyone can die, whether it's a nameless peasant or one of the major players.  And you know, there was one point where it was a tad depressing, but for the most part, wow, what a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />I'm not a fast reader and I have a lot going on in my life, so this book took about a month to read.  But unlike my usual mentality of, \\"needing to conquer the book and add it to my book shelf\\", I savored this one.  I didn't want it to end.  Alas, all things do come to an end.  I can only hope the next book is as good.<br /><br />5 stars
B004G5VFOU|5.0|THis cd is a reissue of a previus product. The new song selection and unreleased material makes it worth having. This is a class act from the cd booklet chock full of information to the song selection, remastered and improved in sound quality and the unreleased gems of familure yet as new songs makes this a must have imo.
1597801585|5.0|This is just an excellent story, with intersting \\"out of the box\\" ideas and a grimy, seedy setting that gives a real, solid feel to the world.  Personally, I find the steam punk genre unrealistic.  It stretches my ability to suspend disbelief to think that this is how the future could end up.  But, no doubt the author is a great story teller.  Not being a fan of the genre, the fact that I even read the book is a testament to that.
B0050N8N0Q|2.0|Similar to the albums they recorded under the name MGMT, there are a couple very goods songs (the first two) and a bunch of mediocre stuff.  I suggest checking out Two Door Cinema Club or The Joy Formidable instead.
B005869U6G|1.0|I'm glad Brandon says drugs shouldn't be used as an excuse or crutch for creativity. At the same time, after listening to this album, I can honestly say that all of Incubus needs to go back to whatever &#34;headspace&#34; they were in for their next album.
B005AUWY90|2.0|What this movie had in action it lacked in heart.<br />This is the first time I have ever been disappointed by a Pixar film.<br />I tend to write to what emotions were evoked or what about the film I enjoyed rather than plot points so I will primarily stick to the same here with some interjections regarding theme.<br />This was mostly a \\"spy\\" movie.  Great animation, excellent voice acting all of the technical wonders that Pixar can bring to the screen.<br />The plot was decent, but a little advanced for most kids 8 or under.<br />Guns...lots of guns.  Yeah, I know that they are not people, but kids get the inference.  \\"Things\\" get shot, in that they are animated and infused with persona, \\"things\\" die.  Not suitable for a G-rated film.  Not suitable for my child.<br />Lastly and most important-where was the heart and soul present in all other Pixar films?!  There was kind of a broad message about staying true to yourself and your friends, but this was tucked away with jokes from Mater (Larry the Cable guy) and an almost absent Lightning McQueen who is not the protagonist of this film.<br />I came away heartbroken.  My just seven-year old son said it best; when asked which one he liked best \\"Cars\\" or \\"Cars 2\\" he noted \\"Cars 2\\" because it had so much more action.  Of course he did.  He does not usually get to see guns blazing or perpetual motion in his movies.<br />I give this movie a 2-star rating based on some great animation and use of technology with a decent story, but take away so much for missing what Pixar has always provided-A message, a real story and true heart.
B004WJRF6C|4.0|I own the 1993 British CD of McCartney (1) and compared the sound quality between this release and the newly mastered edition. Unfortunately I don't hear a vast improvement in the sound, however if you consider this album dates back from 1969/1970 and recorded at home, then you can't really expect anything spectacular. The music however is superb and timeless. This 1970 album, though recorded at home, sounds a lot better than the 1980 followup \\"McCartney II\\", which is the other album I bought at the same time as this one. The mastering sounds very much like -if not the same as - the 2003 Wingspan edition: In other words, \\"Every Night\\", Man We Was Lonely\\" etc, sound exactly the same. Therefore if you must own this album, get either Wingspan, or the heavily discounted 1993 British releases instead of this one unless the price falls significantly. The digipak booklet contains the lyrics and some additional photos of Paul and the family that Linda took in color and B&W. The bonus tracks (7) have not been previously released and are for the most part, live versions of the album tracks or demos of tracks that rightly never saw the light of day, so you are not really missing anything. Given the fact that the newly remastered McCartney albums are not significantly better sounding than the previous releases, this is the last Sir Paul album I will buy. Considering that, for the past (roughly) 20 years his quality of material has suffered significantly, his albums from the 1970s and 1980's yield more acceptance (and profit) than stuff released after 1990. At least the CDs (alone) are priced reasonably affordable, rather than demanding $20-$25+ like Madness, New Order and George Michael. Call me morbid, but I believe that the passing away of Neil Aspinall greatly benefitted Beatles fans all over. More on this on another CD review.
B004QL7K8O|5.0|I was excited for this movie for a while when I first heard about it. I love Alan Tudyk in basically anything (I was a huge Firefly fan) and Tyler Labine rocked in Reaper. I'm also a big fan of the comedy/horror genre, although the idea of the main characters being hillbillies and it being a spoof... those factors turned me off. I have an unnatural hatred for the \\"Blue collar\\" humor that's become so popular lately. I hate people with \\"redneck pride.\\" I find the whole cultural phenomenon annoying. So I was expecting a bunch of low brow jokes with great acting, that might average out to still be a fun movie to watch.    But, I was wrong. (Not about the fun movie part; that's still true.) The two West Virginian Hillbillies aren't portrayed overblown parodies of hillbillies that have become popular. They're just regular guys who you actually start to care for and like. The jokes aren't lowbrow at all. They're clever, witty, often perfectly ironic, well-timed and well-placed. There are few movies that make me laugh out loud, even with comedies that I like. This movie had me rolling. I was waking up people in my house from being too loud.    Tyler Labine, despite being a lesser known actor, gets the larger role and he shines in it. Alan Tudyk is a great supporting actor in this though, not letting me down in the slightest regard.    The movie hasn't been officially released yet, and at the time of writing this, there are no negative reviews on Amazon of it. When they do inevitably show up, ignore them. Anyone who didn't like it will have either gone in expecting a straight horror movie or they wanted Larry the Cable Guy in every role. Ignore it. If you're on the fence about watching this movie, I'm officially pushing you off of it. Go watch it.
B004WJREMW|3.0|I own a copy of the 1993 British remasters of this and other McCartney albums. I also have an original vinyl copy of this album. I bought the McCartney I and II package and did not have a chance to listen to the CDs until today.  regarding the 1980 McCartney II album: The remastering job adds barely a little more volume and bass, but no clarity to the sound. I did not have any real high expectations from this particular album as it was recorded under worse conditions than pre-Sgt Pepper albums. If you consider that \\"Yesterday\\" sounds like it was recorded in a garbage can, then you have an idea what the album sounds like as it was recorded cheaply at home, and sounds more like a demo than an official release. Having said that, I still love this album for the memories it brings and for the songs themselves. I just wish Paul would have - with all his millions - secured better recording equipment and/or a competent sound engineer. If you already own the 1993 British release, this remastering will not really open your ears to any \\"new\\" or \\"hitherto unheard\\" sounds. The additional 8 tracks from the 2nd CD: 4 you have already heard on B sides or have seen them in previous \\"bonus tracks\\" releases. Buy this release if the price drops significantly and/or if your old copy can't cut it anymore. There is a booklet attached to the digipak case containing some Photos of Paul in the studio, again if you don't have this album, they are not the reason to buy it for. The remastering does not significantly improve the sound even in the bonus tracks you probably already have \\"Coming up (live)\\", \\"Check my machine\\", \\"Secret Friend\\", \\"Wonderful Christmastime\\" (you would have thought Sir Paul would have been kind enough to provide the record company with a stereo mix of the song.
B001TODCII|5.0|I was so impressed by the condition of this movie and it came directly to my home which saved me from having to find someone to come and get me since I am incapacitated due to surgery. Hightly recommended.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I'm just going to keep it short, and simple.  This is not the best of the series, and yes, it is very much like the previous book - but I expected that having read about what the author has had to do with the series and deciding to split one book into two.  That being said, I didn't hate it and I wasn't even disappointed with it.  I purposely had to slow myself down because I knew I was reading it too fast (and I know it's going to be a desperately long time before the next one comes out).  I did finally finish it - and I was shocked by a few things going on at the end.  Happily so.  I didn't expect the Dornish plot in Meereen to work out the way it did, that's for sure.  The last chapter for Jon was also a little unexpected.<br /><br />Also, about the \\"new\\" character and no one seeing it coming - there have been hints dropped in the previous books about this character's possible existence, in my opinion.  It made sense to me with what had been seen by Dany in Qarth.<br /><br />Anyway, I liked it.  Wasn't the greatest of the series, but is moving things along and placing people where they need to be (and having them realize things they'll need to know) in order to move along towards the end.  If I'm remembering correctly there are still 2 more books in the series; it's hard to expect that all these necessary character developments are finished in the 3rd to last book.
B004EPYZUI|1.0|Shouldn't even be called a Movie because there was NO character development or any real plot. If you want to watch a music video/video game then you will love this movie. The writer and/or director did a lazy job!!!! I really didn't care if any of the characters lived or died. You could cut out about 90% of the \\"movie\\" and you wouldn't have really missed anything!!!
B005DC68NI|5.0|This book contains some great info for people looking to self-publish and those who are already self-publishing.  There is something for everybody in this book.  Gaughran gives some great tips on social networking which is key in the self-publishing world.  I particularly enjoyed the author success stories.  People are making money self-publishing...A LOT OF MONEY! Some authors like Victorine Lieske have made it on to the New York Time's best-selling e-book list.<br /><br />Self-publishing is hard work but LET'S GET DIGITAL helps to make life easier by providing tools that are useful and often times necessary.  This book is a must read.
0670022411|4.0|I was skeptical at first--I've read all of the Charlaine Harris novels, plus a few other vamp books, and I felt like I had my fill of the \\"creature\\" story lines.  I read this book because it was a pick by my book club.  I was hooked after the first few chapters, and finished the book very quickly.  Great settings, great characters, and interesting plot.  I will have to say that I was disappointed that there was no ending, or even somewhat of a conclusion--you'll have to keep reading the series to get any answers.  My only other criticism is that several new characters are introduced at the end of the book.  Again, I think it's just hype for the next book in the series, but I would have preferred some sort of conclusion to this story, with just enough of a bridge to carry readers over to the next book.  Overall, I give this book an A-!
0439023521|5.0|At first I wasn't particularly interested in reading this book because it wasn't the typical drama/romance book I usually read. But then after reading the reviews I decided to go ahead and give it a chance. I was absolutely right, there was nothing typical about this book, it was so much more! An amazing read! Highly recommended!
B004XJHBCE|5.0|I own an ASUS EEE Pad Transformer and this really negates extra homescreens and messy icon handling. Great for quick launches and general organization. Apple, look to better innovation like this. Impressive!!
0439023513|5.0|This was my first time reading a series and I've decided I'm sticking with series from now on! Usually wheI'm done reading a book I want more, I'm still hungry, but with this book I felt I had my full share and was ready to let the characters go by the time I put the book down.    A couple points that could have been better:    Prim's death could have been more emotional. I didn't feel like Collins made it a big enough deal. The reason that all of this happened was because Katniss did not want her sister to go into the games and Prim still ended up dead. I feel like she could have acknowledged how things had come full circle.    Also, I got a little sick of Katniss blaming herself for everything and thinking that she was a horrible person. I was waiting for her to accept the fact that she wasn't a terrible person but I don't think she ever really did.    But all in all, I loved the entire series. I lived in the three books while I was reading them and I can't wait for Collin's next set of books.
B003Y5H53S|1.0|We rented this from the local Redbox and boy what a mistake that was. My almost 6-year-old luckily lost interest in it before it got to the part that would have scared him to death. Not recommended for any home with young kids.

B004XJHBCE|3.0|This is a very capable app. There is one rather annoying flaw I have discovered though. I am unable to add new labels with the Android keyboard on my Velocity Micro Cruz T301 tablet.  When I attempt to do so I highlight the new Label name which brings up the Select input method box which has only one choice which is Android keyboard and when I select that single choice it does not bring up the onscreen Android keyboard like it does in all my other apps.  So there is a incompatibility with the Velocity Micro Cruz T301 with Android 2.2. But if you are willing to live with the default labels that are provided it is fantastic app.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|Its a toy sonic screwdriver, what else is there to say? It lights up and makes the buzzing sound when you push the button. The fact that its also a pen helps me feel less ashamed of myself for being a 32 year old man who bought a toy. Its plastic but its got a metallic look. It seems like it can be easily broken if you have a child running around with it. The invisible UV ink works as advertised. Its very authentic, I would highly recommend it to adult or teen Doctor Who fans. The invisible UV ink works as advertised.
B004WJREMW|1.0|Huey Lewis once did a little tune called \\"Bad Is Bad\\".  Turns out that tune sums up McCartney II very well.  I am amused by all the fans who try to justify this album.  When Paul is good, he is not only good, he's absolutely the best.  But when he's bad, well, he's bad.  I listen to this and it is hard for me to believe this is the same guy who wrote all those great Beatle songs.    So, let's be honest and call it like it is.  There are good Paul Mccartney albums.  And then, there is this collection of rubbish.    Bad is bad.

B0056BMK6K|1.0|This book is fine if you're only interested in reading page after page about the author's own success. I was, however, looking for tips on how to be a successful indie publisher, and there are none here you probably couldn't figure out on your own.<br /><br />Here's what you will find:lots of ads for John Locke's other books, ads that start even before the first page; lots and lots of bragging interspersed with cries of \\"I'm not bragging!\\" (the author doth protest too much); lots of talk about why e-publishing is better than traditional publishing; how he spent $25,000 making mistakes (which might be helpful to the few indie publishers who think paid advertising and the like is worth it); lots and lots of promises that he will tell you how he did it (which never goes beyond the obvious) spread over many pages; stuff like \\"What? I'm giving you a ten thousand dollar idea in a $4.99 eBook, $9.99 paperback? Yup. And I'm including a wealth of other valuable ideas, too\\" (sounds like an infomercial, doesn't it?);  a question and answer session where he asks himself questions like \\"Where do you get your confidence? How did you know you were going to be successful as an author?\\" and \\"How does it feel to have a best selling book?\\"; a lot about the target audience he writes for and how he interacts with it; an entire chapter about all the things he says you're doing wrong (because who doesn't like an author who assumes his readers are doing everything wrong?); setting goals and how this relates to the time he spent as an insurance salesman (yup, he was an insurance salesman. You can write your own joke here); join Twitter!; develop a brand!; keep writing books!; create a website!; and lots of other things ending with exclamation points!<br /><br />So don't make the mistake I made, and don't waste your money on this book. Instead, check out J.A. Konrath's blog, A Newbie's Guide to Publishing, and Zoe Winter's hype-free book on the same topic:[[ASIN:B004AYD90U Smart Self-Publishing: Becoming an Indie Author]].ing: Becoming an Indie Author]].

0545259088|3.0|I liked this series overall.  The first book was far better than the rest.  This book was depressing to say the least.  I had to put it down more than a few times because I was being drawn into the same mood.  The last third or little less was better.  I didn't feel as connected to Sam and Grace or Cole and Isabel.  The few moments when both characters share a scene were left unsatisfying.  But then just as the book starts to get better in the later half, it ends with too many questions unanswered.  A major question that deals with life or death is not satisfying to leave this series on.  I would have been ok not knowing if they were together forever as a couple.  But knowing if someone lived is important.  Like one review said, I would have been better off stopping at Shiver.  But in the end this series installment faired better than most I read this year (ie City of Crap and Passion that didn't exist).  I have high hopes for the next installment of Nightshade.  Anything at this point can be better than what I've read so far 2011 in YA paranormal series.

B00005LMBK|4.0|Ten years old and still sounds great. Some albums and collaborations fail because they try to do too much, be too much. That's why Gorillaz succeeds. It's everything into the blender but comes out smooth, not chunky. A bit of hip-hop, a touch of dance, and a little...Blur.<br /><br />\\"Clint Eastwood\\" was the hit here, but I think I've always liked \\"Rock The House\\" even more. The vocal delivery, and the hook of those retro horns. Just great. \\"19-2000\\" is also a catchy track, and another single I think. The rest is all good fun.<br /><br />This is pennies used anymore. There's no reason not to give it a listen.
0061537969|3.0|While this audiobook had it's funny moments, its insightful moments, and its heart-wrenching moments, and the narrator, Christopher Evan Welch, did a pretty good job, I never did quite get into it.  Between the brow-beating about manifesting your destiny, constant talk of auto racing (which I admit I'm not into), and never quite getting the full story (why was Eve's dad obsessed with getting custody of Zoe?), it just couldn't hold my attention very well.  I did get through it, but I think if I'd been reading the book, instead of listening to the CDs while I did other things in my car and around the house, I wouldn't have finished it.     If you're a dog lover and a race car lover, then this may be the perfect book for you.  If not, I'd probably recommend skipping it.
B001MEJY8W|1.0|Boring film.  Not scary.  Not really all that gross.  Just boring an pointless.  The French have not right to get into horror.  They suck at it.  They need to stick to romance or be intellectuals.  If the great dead film makers of France could see these new French horror films they would think the Nazis were still occupying their country.  High Tension, Inside, Martyrs...all a waste of time.  These are not Horror films but Horrid films.  It takes more than buckets of blood and plot twists to make a good horror film.  The French have been around long enough to know this.
0553801473|4.0|A lot of the criticism of this book is unfair.  And some of it is fair.<br /><br />ADWD is a very intriguing book.  It is gorgeously written and I couldn't put it down.  GRRM gives us a wealth of information and paints his world in great detail.<br /><br />Sadly, although there is a ton of build up and tension, it doesn't go anywhere.  It feels like the book is missing a few chapters.  Just when you think things are coming to a head... nothing.  Wait until The Winds of Winter.  I understand this is a long series, and this book is just a small part of a much grander, larger story.  But that's the feeling you get by the end.  It was just one very long tease.<br /><br />All that said, ADWD is much better than A Feast for Crows.  And it can stand as an equal to A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings.  But if you're expecting A Storm of Swords, you're in for disappointment.<br /><br />From first impression, I'd be tempted to give the book 3.5 stars.  Upon re-read, I'd give it 5 stars if the book had a true third act.  It really is a good read.  So, I'm splitting the difference and giving it 4 stars.<br /><br />Now let's all pray it isn't a long wait for TWOW.
B001F6TXME|5.0|This little cable release is great and easy to use.  I've had bad luck with wireless remotes and all I was looking for was the ability to release the shutter on my camera while mounted on the tripod without touching the camera itself and to use the bulb feature to keep my shutter locked open.  The release button is large and easy to use when not looking at the device or in the dark. To use the bulb feature, just press the button and slide forward to lock.  No little metal screws to try and set (and un-set).  Though I've not done it, I believe this would be very easy to use while wear a pair of gloves.  My only concern is the entire remote is made of plastic, so I'm very careful in how I handle it and keep it protected in my camera bag.  At 41\\" the cable is not very long, which is fine for what I need, but if you are looking to do nature photography and hide from any animals, this isn't going to work that great for you. For the price, this is a great piece of equipment to add to your camera bag.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|I've been stumped many times while playing but always come back for more. Just wish three would be quicker updates. Love being able to make suggestions.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I sincerely hope that this authoress has her series books already lined up and waiting to go!  I for one, found this book to be intoxicating and exciting.  I literally \\"felt\\" like I was there with Diana and Matthew.  I could smell the odors of old parchment and other mystical ingredients.  I am (forgive the pun) \\"spellbound\\"!!      This book is the first in (I HOPE) a LONG line of witch, daemon, vampire and human stories!!  I can't wait to see, read, hear, smell, and taste--what comes next.      Deborah Harkness does take some special license with regard to tenure etc.... But hello??  It's FICTION!  It is also chock full of all kinds of historical facts and references.  I for one, applaud her imagination and clever turn of phrase.      To those reviewers who slammed the book---I would venture to guess that you all have been spending MUCH too much time attacking the work of another.  One tends to wonder if whoever is throwing out this angry diatribe, has been watching too much TV news or better yet, Reality TV.    I say it's time to go back to using our minds and our imaginations--jump into a great read...question things, imagine, feel, taste, touch....all with your mind.      All of which, Deborah Harkness has allowed me to do with this first book.  I sincerely hope that there is more to come and am eagerly awaiting the next installment!!
B0050KEVO6|5.0|Alchemy is a revelation in its simplicity. Just combine elements to see what you can make. That's all there is to it, and I can't put it down. The game even has a sense of humor; try combining life with a mushroom. Very good game.
0553805371|4.0|Stephen Hawking is the world's most famous scientist. His accomplishment in theoretical physics are fairly obscure, but he well-known for surviving a degenerative nerve disease that crippled his body, and for writing one of the best-selling science books ever written.    Hawking's 1988 [[ASIN:0553380168 A Brief History of Time]] sold ten million copies. The book was not an easy read, and it is a wonder that is sold so well. Now Hawking has teamed up with Leonard Mlodinow to write a more readable and more current book on physics and cosmology.    The Grand Design give a short and entertaining history of astronomy and physics. It explains how ancient Greeks theorized about atoms, musical harmonies, solar eclipses, and planetary orbits. Most of all, they used observation and mathematics to systematically explain the natural world. That story continues into the 20th century, with the discoveries of relativity and quantum mechanics.    The authors attempt to address the question of reality. When strange properties of atoms and collapsed stars were discovered, the question naturally arises as to whether they are as real as everyday objects. The question is particularly difficult when there are multiple theories that are consistent with the observational data, such as the Ptolemy and Copernicus models of the solar system. Modern relativity teaches that these are equally valid, so it is not clear whether it is correct to say that the Earth really moves.    The book is an extended argument for scientific determinism and the reality of mathematical models. The view is that if a mathematical model is attractive enough, then we should adopt it as being real. If there is an aesthetically pleasing model of multiple universes that physicists adopt, then we should accept those universes as being real, even if there is no hope of ever observing them.    While Hawking's earlier book attempted to gain knowledge about the mind of God, this book declares God to be unnecessary, and so istheology and philosophy. Modern mathematical theories of physics can explain it all. God is not even needed to create the big bang that started the universe, as physics can explain why the big bang happened.    The climax of the book is to push an esoteric theory called M-theory, and formerly called string theory. They don't really tell us what M-theory is, or what the evidence for it is. They do say that it is the culmination of Einstein's vision of a unified theory of everything. It is not a scientific theory in the traditional sense of explaining observations. It is a loose collection of ideas centered around the conviction that all questions can be answered by pure thought from theoretical physicists who believe in the reality of mathematical models.
B004O3YGMC|3.0|I REALLY want to give this app 5 stars but I can't. I'm using Samsung Nexxus 4G &amp; most of the time splashtop can't find my PC.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Thank you for sharing your unfathomable experience.   Every person who has had the honor of reading your thoughtful and painful memories will have gained perspective and and a better understanding of the power of love, family, and our human ability to survive.   Jaycee, you are a strong person.  I truly feel honored that you chose to share such a sacred part of you life with us.  I have a heart full of love and respect for your courage and ability to cope in an impossible environment.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|When I first switched from blackberry to android, I hated not being able to organize my apps into folders to provide easy access while not cluttering my desktop. This app fixed that in the most efficient way possible, while integrating a simple uninstaller. It's user friendly and IMHO a must-have for any power user. The only thing that pisses me off is that I paid for it and today it's free, LOL. totally worth even more than the asking price though. Best app I've downloaded to date.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|Works beautifully with LauncherPro!  Finally, I can put Folders on the dock bar.  This program allowed me to remove all of the clutter from my home screen, great work!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I am utterly amazed by the way Jaycee used her own words to create this profound piece of literature with less than a fifth grade education.  She takes you through the mind of a scared and horrified eleven year old girl as she is captured and forced to suffer through unimaginable torture for 18 long years.  This is a story of ultimate survival!      Some reviewers are less than appreciative of the horrors Jaycee went through.  Some even think Jaycee should have had a ghost writer, but I think had she given her voice to a ghost writer it would only have served to further victimize her.  After what she went through, she deserves to have her voice heard, and by utilizing a ghost writer she would have essentially had her voice taken from her.  After 18 years in captivity, I believe enough was taken from her.      Some reviewers would have you believe that her story was not well written, but I have read books by college grads that were not as well written as A Stolen Life.   Considering Jaycee boasts less than a fifth grade education, this is quite an accomplishment.      In A Stolen Life, Jaycee tells of her normal life before her abduction.  She recounts in excrutiatingly vivid detail of her abduction, her violent rapes, and how she managed to give birth to her children in the backyard.  Some reviewers would have you believe that Jaycee didn't mention enough about her children in the book, and that she tells more about her pets than her children.  As readers, we must understand that as a mother and a victim Jaycee has every right and every reason to protect her girls.  You definitely feel from her own words that she loves them dearly.  One day, they may tell us their story.  This story was not about them, it was about Jaycee's survival.  For 18 years, she lost her name and the very person she was and could have been.  This is a story of an eleven year old girl, forced to endure and survive things that the vast majority of us could not even imagine in our worst nightmares.  The story is told in the voice of this eleven year old.  It is shocking and frightening, but in the end she survived to tell us about it in her own words.      How courageous!?!    So before giving this book a negative review, please keep in mind that this book was not meant to be a pleasant reading experience.  It was not meant for an overly critical audience.  It is simply a recounting of events and a reflection of those events by an author who experienced the events.  It was meant to help others, not to entertain the masses.  If you are a survivor, this book is sure to remind you that you are not alone!  If you have never experienced acts of abuse, hopefully this book will serve to teach you what evil is in this world.  Protect your children at all costs!!!
B0055FR5PS|4.0|No reason this movie deserves a negative rating. Just as entertaining as Independence Day, if not better. Same motivational feel, but not at corny.
B003X73QA8|5.0|This album is truly amazing. The music gets better and better each time you listen to it. Even if you don't usually like indie music, you should try this album. Listen to it more than once before you make your final opinion on it, becuase there is so much musical genius in each song. Songs on this album that I didn't love at first became my favorites. This album is a masterpiece!
0553801473|4.0|I was looking forward to this book to resolve some of the story lines, especially with Dany and her dragons.  Instead we had 1000 pages that covered maybe a month... and I'm still waiting for Tyrion to cross paths with Dany!  (Assuming they are both alive past the first chapter of the next book...)<br /><br />Too many people die that I like, and the ones I wanted to see die are still alive for now.<br /><br />The writing as always is great, and there are two new potential dragons/dragon riders on my radar. Some twists I definitely wasn't expecting, but leave me wondering how everything is going to turn out in the end.  It's the end of the second act and everything looks hopeless.  I don't know how I will be able to wait for the next book to come along and save some of these folks.

0765324849|5.0|I am a huge bioshock fan and had to buy this book. Now, I am not the type of person that reads in their spare time, I cannot stand reading books and this was the first non-school related book that I have bought in at least 4 years that I actually wanted to read. I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN, IT IS AMAZING. I do not know who John Shirley is but he is now my favorite author.  The way he leads up to the creation of Rapture is I can't even think of a word for it.  BUY THIS BOOK AND READ IT!
B000W7JWUA|2.0|Catan is a good game, but in this latest edition the components that make up the \\"board\\" are very poor quality.  Out of the box, the frame within which you build the board is warped making it difficult to keep the tiles in their place.  As you play, the thin tiles move and shift around.  Other components and cards are fine, but they cut corners on quality in the worst possible place.    I don't mind if they want to save some cost, but you should make sure it works properly.  There are other games priced similarly that are just as fun with better components.  I'd recommend looking at those untilt they fix this game.
0553801473|2.0|Let me first start by saying I LOVE this series.  But after waiting seriously a long time for this book, getting the book (like a kid at christmas) sitting down and reading it.  I finish it and my first thought was maybe I skipped a chapter.  I did not care how long the book was I enjoy the way Mr. Martin writes.  but the book should have been called tyrion, jon and denerys.  I felt completely cheated.  without giving any spoilers.  through some parts of the book I felt like I was reading another series.  All I can do is wait for the next installment and hope for the best.  Mr. Martin has engaged me for 4/5 books in the series so now we waiting hopefully not as long.  heres crossing our fingers
B004GEGW44|5.0|Lovely movie based on the British Green Knowe children's books. Charming, well cast & acted, and beautifully photographed to represent time changes.
B003E8P9G0|4.0|I know I am a little late catching up to the Kane Chronicles, but I must say that I love the new series by Rick Riordan and I'm very happy that he's switched from Greek to Egyptian mythology. I always felt that his books were great tools to enlighten and interest youngsters on ancient history, which is a nice touch. This series carries the history torch as well. Thought this first book was great and it did keep me interested but every once in awhile a few of those 41 chapters dragged, which is why I gave it 4 stars. The story could have been tightened up a bit and it would have been more engaging. Still, it was a fun read and I am sure others will enjoy it. I hope they turn this series into movies as well. Should translate nicely.

B004G600A4|5.0|The wonderful thing about `Tangled' is that it instantly calls to mind the glory days of Disney, the years that followed the glorious `The Little Mermaid' and led into `Beauty and the Beast'; two of the greatest animated films of all time.  Yes, `Tangled' is bursting at the seams with love, danger, charm and MUSIC!  With infectious songs that swell in the heart, `Tangled' revisits the days of old, the days when Disney made us feel all warm and cuddly on the inside.<br /><br />`Tangled' makes my heart feel super happy.<br /><br />Taking the classic story of Rapunzel and giving it a facelift, `Tangled' tells the poetic tale of a beautiful young princess named Rapunzel who is kidnapped and locked away in a hidden tower by the evil Mother Gothel, a woman who uses Rapunzel's magical golden hair to stay young forever.  Over the years, Rapunzel dreamed of leaving the tower, hoping to see the beautiful lanterns the filled the sky every year on her birthday, but her mother (err, abductor) refused to let her leave, stating that her hair was too valuable and that outsiders would try to take advantage of her.  Remaining in the tower at all times was her only protection from the evils of the outside world.  Rapunzel's whole world is turned upside down the day she meets the thief, Flynn Rider.  Fresh off of stealing a royal crown, Flynn winds up hiding out in the tucked away tower that houses our young princess, and with a little persuasion, Rapunzel is able to get Flynn to agree to take her to see the lanterns.  Obstacles abound and life lessons are learned, with spunk and charm and a whole lot of beauty dripping from every frame (OMG this movie is a CGI dreamsticle).<br /><br />While the overall lay of the plot may be a bit conventional (especially concerning the `love' story angle), there is so much excitement to be found in this animated gem that one can't help but fall in love with it.  The voice work is astonishing (YES, THEY CAN ALL SING) and the emotional connection is certainly felt.  Happy endings are what Disney was made for, and they deliver a magical one that will make anyone smile.  Each scene is laid out with the viewer in mind, creating gorgeous backdrops to plop our cast of characters in, and each character certainly has a life all their own; even Maximus the horse.<br /><br />A true crowd pleasure, and every little girls dream (my daughter absolutely LOVES this movie), `Tangled' is a true return to form for Disney; a modern masterpiece of animated proportions.<br /><br />At last, I see the light!<br /><br />:-Dings are what Disney was made for, and they deliver a magical one that will make anyone smile.

0670022411|3.0|*Some spoilers*   This book could have been at least 200 pages shorter.  Nothing really happens in the first 1/4 of the book, and the rest alternates between a couple chapters of plot and then several chapters of nothing.  The author spends way too much time describing mundane things, such as how wine tastes (and I realize the author is a wine blogger, but come on), and how the main character's yoga and rowing sessions went.        I also found the main character to be whiny.  The author tries to make it seem like she is a strong, independent woman, but she never quite gets there.      As far as the romance between the witch and the vampire, I did not find it that romantic.  They fall in love basically at first sight, and the rest of the 'romance' is comprised of them being possessive of each other.  And of course, there's the obligatory scene in every vampire book/movie, where the vamp is dying and his love has to give him her blood.       The only really great part about the book was the ancestral witch house.  It has ghosts, hides things, adds rooms, and has a mind of its own.  It kind of reminded me of Hogwarts.    Also, the ending was disappointing, most likely because the author had to wrap up a plot that hadn't been concentrated on enough, so too much information was introduced at the last second.     Overall, I felt like there was a decent plot, but it was bogged down with mundane descriptions of things that had no bearing on the plot, and a romance that could use work.
B003UESJ9M|3.0|I'm all for this revitalization of Gwyneth Paltrow's career.  I adore her 90's work and find her recent stint on `Glee' as well as her comeback to film (and departure into music) to be wholly welcome and something I can't get enough of.  Paltrow is a true talent; a shining star and I'm so happy that she's made her way back to us.  While `Country Strong' as a film is very flawed, her performance within is noteworthy for its honesty and earnest quality.<br /><br />I just wish she had been handed a better script.<br /><br />`Country Strong' tells the story of wayward Kelly Canter; Grammy winning country star and public drunk.  The film opens with Kelly in rehab sparking fires with Beau, an orderly who loves to sing and play his guitar.  Kelly is ripped from rehab by her manager/husband who insists that she go back out on the road to rebuild her public figure after an `incident' in Dallas left her name tattered.  At his wife's request, her husband James allows Beau to join her tour (not after some begrudging) as well as a former beauty queen named Chiles.  On the road, relationships form and crumble under the pressure of fame and fortune and the true colors of those involved begin to come through.  It is Kelly, though, who suffers the brunt as her troubles with drinking, not fully under control, begin to interfere with her comeback tour.<br /><br />While the first half makes a tad more sense than the second, the second half isn't bogged down by the ridiculous dialog, so I'm kind of torn as to which half works the best.  It's hard because if I were looking at this as a senseless summer blockbuster then I may react differently to the prose, but when you are this dark and manipulative in your themes then you kind of have to have a sliver of realism in order to back up your direction, and that is something that `Country Strong' just doesn't get.  At its heart, it is trying to make a point that is too extreme.<br /><br />Life isn't always this melancholy.<br /><br />As a whole, `Country Strong' survives because of some real talented actors/singers who make the most of their scarcely developed characters in order to bring us something we want to continue watching.  Paltrow is magnificent as Kelly, who is arguably the most fleshed out of the characters.  She understands the shading needed to make Kelly feel alive, although the repetitive dynamics of the script dampen her chances to shine as brightly as she could have had her character been given more to work with.  I've been impressed with Tim McGraw's performances in the past (I still stand behind my belief that he should have be Oscar nominated for `Friday Night Lights') and he does a commendable job here, although I don't think he layers James in a way that makes him come off as anything other than a creep.  Garrett Hedlund is a little clich&eacute;d in his portrayal of Beau, but his vocal talent is undeniable, and he finds chemistry with both Paltrow and Meester that is delightful to watch.  Speaking of Meester, I was really impressed with her spunky yet guarded portrayal of Chiles.  She really made her feel three-dimensional.  She also breathes a life into the film, a sort of jovial atmosphere that counteracts the films more bleak themes.<br /><br />The ending, while on the outset anti-clich&eacute;d, is a tad predictable, but the actors sell it (for the most part).  Still, the main highlight here is the music, all of which is kind of wonderful.  The songs written for this film are beautiful, especially the big `Coming Home' number and the intimate `Timings Everything', which opens the closes the film perfectly.  I think that Shana Feste has talent as a director and writer, but like her previous work (`The Greatest') she hasn't mastered developing her themes in a way that feel truly authentic.  They feel like fabrications, like movies with a slight soap operatic twist that takes them out of the realm of `gritty, raw and real' and makes them feel somewhat fake.  But, a total plus isthe way she works with her actors, and with time I have faith that she can produce something truly noteworthy.<br /><br />But if you do anything, buy the soundtrack!h that she can produce something truly noteworthy.    But if you do anything, buy the soundtrack!
B002ZG98UA|3.0|Resident Evil's fourth 3-D installment had its work cut out for it: Alice was now an army of clones hell-bent on digging Wesker, leader of the Umbrella Corporation, out of his hole and squashing him like a bug. Wesker was replaced by a more physical actor, which is a good sign - fans of the series know just how tough he really is.<br /><br />Where the third installment killed off characters in a desperate bid to save the few remaining survivors, this movie is about Alice (Mila Jovovavich) and Claire Redfield (Ali Larter).  After neatly offing the clones, removing her superpowers, and uprooting Wesker, Afterlife switches gears to Alice's lonely search for other human beings.<br /><br />Mila looks rounder, sexier, more full in this film than she has in all of the other Resident Evil movies put together  Her crystal gaze is as lovely and piercing as ever, and the movie wisely exchanges Alice's thigh-high dominatrix outfit for something more practical. Motherhood suits her.<br /><br />Claire, on the other hand, starts out suitably mussed and becomes inexplicably more and more glam with every camera shot. She has no other purpose than to be the eye candy got when Alice is unconscious, which isn't very often.<br /><br />Things pick up when Alice crash lands her plane onto a prison surrounded by zombies.  Paul W. S. Anderson has an eye for interesting shots, and he finds beauty in the grotesque, from a burnt-out Hollywood to the bloody zombie smear left by a low-flying plane. We end with a few new survivor stereotypes who do not disappoint - the sleazy agent, the hopeful actress, the noble sports hero, the miscellaneous guy with an accent, the nerdy guy prone to freaking out.  Most will die - except for the ones we can recognize from the game, in which case they'll stick around to the end.<br /><br />All the survivors seek Arcadia, a safe haven free from the zombie infection. Arcadia is not what it seems, of course, and then we're back to CGI zombies with tentacles for mouths, dogs that split in half, and really big guys with axes.  None of this is explained and for fans of the series, they don't need to be. We've seen them all in Resident Evil 5.<br /><br />What's surprising is how the fourth installment is so uninterested in continuity with its own movie canon and focused on staying true to the video game series. Fans of the game will applaud seeing their favorite monsters on the silver screen - everyone else will probably be confused.<br /><br />All the interesting elements that made the third installment so unique have been jettisoned in favor of tentacles, standard survivor tropes, and big, bad Wesker. Resident Evil Afterlife isn't a bad movie.  It's just not as good as its predecessor.big guys with axes.  None of this is explained and for fans of the series, they don't need to be.

B0025UHKNS|3.0|bought this to help train for my first marathon but after taking it out of the pacakage and trying it one time I hd to return it.<br /><br />I have very small wrists and it felt big and heavy on them.<br /><br />it did take me a while to figure out the setting but once i did they are good and rate them high. perfect for running and walking both.<br /><br />I didn't like that the heart monitor was a strap and don't remember seeing that in the product information before I bought it.
B004ZG5F3M|5.0|In short: A miracle! This new version which is 1080P 1.85:1 Widescreen (not 1080i as is the Canadian version and which I have not seen) fills the screen. The original DVD I always had a hard time getting the colors and contrast right. From my view point this movie was shot perfectly that depicted an old European town in available light. The colors were very much muted earth colors except for the reds(both hooded garments of the two main characters)and the lighting was so special in many ways. There is a lot of fog which adds to the back drop of this type of story. If only the DVD could do justice to it. This is probably the most difficult lighting to get right. But this Blu-ray does. I am a black and white photographer that is very aware of the importance of detail in the shadows. Many times, even with Blu-ray they aren't quite right. Often too contrasty but most of the time things can be very good. Some would say I'm fussy but I just have a standard I'm going for. I have an inexpensive LG Blu-ray player and also an LG screen that is not 720 but the true 1080 which does help in both details in shadows and the higher highlights. So with that I will say that out of all my Blu-rays this is the best transfer I've seen to date. The Pixar type movies are always good since they are originally in digital. The movie \\"9\\" whether you like the movie or not I think is the best of the bunch. The effects of the \\"aura\\" of the textures and colors have their own story that supports the story line: Like a good arrangement behind a voice. The Blu-ray of this movie is of that quality. The fog, all the many pastel colors, are defined but still soft. The skin tones are soft but distinct,and the way the tones and textures of various objects and scenery, that are at times enhanced or changed, are presented perfectly and now makes sense of why they did this. Each scene, for a visual type like myself, was almost distracting. I really have never seen the palette continuously before so well done in a movie:Art in motion. And....not artificial looking like some. The satin in those red hoods is terrific! When the chocolate is mixed in close-ups makes your mouth water.<br />The sound is in DTS (with a choice for Dolby 5.1) and is also delightful. When voices go out of the scene they are very carefully depicted moving off left or right. The sound stage has great depth to it and the separation in sounds helps the over all choice of music. The tone of the guitar is very clearly heard.<br />As far as a movie goes, separate from all this teckie stuff, I do think this is one of the best movies I know of. The acting is superb. The story line shows what rigidity does to ones' views. You can even see it in the light of today's political arguments and how when one side or the other becomes rigid in their view point something in the end must give.<br />Now instead of showing off your system with one of the Pixar cartoons, I would say this is the reference Blu-ray that will be hard to beat! I am so presently surprised. And cheap to. And one added note: This has the ability to save the place last played at. I don't even have to have the flash drive plugged in! You can eject the disk or keep it in. It has a provision that takes a few seconds but says it is looking for \\"updates\\" and then a box with the word chocolat comes up and gives you a choice to return to where you left off or not. This will become the standard I hope.<br />I hope this looks as good to you as it did with me. I know this sounds a bit over done but I really mean this stuff. I wouldn't take the time other wise.
0316098329|2.0|I wanted to like this book...a lot of really good reviews, and saw from another author's blog she recommended it.  I first tried the book...I got about 25 pages in, and had to stop.  Since it is written from Jack's 5 year old point of view, it was like reading non-stop baby talk.  I had a really hard time reading it.  He never used the word 'the' when talking about something, he just refered to things as they were.  It got really annoying, and kind of hard to read.  Someone else suggested to me that I get the audio book, so I did.  I got through the first hour and 20 minutes.  It wasn't any better.  It was an hour and 20 minutes of him describing every possible detail of what he did in a day in his 11X11 room, which I must say got very boring very fast.  I don't really have much of a desire to go further, but I will continue with the audio book for the sole reason of I really need to see where it's going and why so many people gave it great reviews.  I will update this review IF i can finish it.  As of now, I cannot recommend it to anyone.  p.s.  I had the same issue in the beginning pages of The Help, as far as the language it was written in, but it was so interesting, that by page 10 I didn't care...this book just has not captured me in the same way.
B004RE29PO|5.0|As always, this is a Cameron Classic and one I couldn't do without in my Blu ray collection...Having owned 4000 movies from VHS to DVD and now Blu Ray I HIGHLY recommend this movie!
0307946711|3.0|I thought that this book was supposed to be funny, but it didn't strike me that way.  In fact, to me, it was immensely sad, about two people who obviously love each other and stay in touch for years but keep making choices that stymie their opportunities to have a romantic relationship.  The book's gimmick is that each chapter takes place on July 15, a year later than the previous chapter, starting with 1988.  I found this structure to be choppy and not conducive to really burying myself in the lives of the two characters.  Careful not to make too much happen on the same day of each year, the author gives us too many days that are either unpleasant or just plain boring.  Even so, two very important events DO take place on July 15, and that's coincidence enough.  Emma is a left-leaning, attractive woman with subzero self-confidence who aspires to change the world around her, or at least the world in her immediate vicinity.  Dexter is a handsome, even \\"beautiful,\\" man with a privileged background and alcoholic tendencies.  In fact, he seems to be drunk on July 15 more often than not, so let's just elevate him to a full-blown alcoholic.  His substance abuse leads to the downhill slide of his on-screen late-night TV career, while Emma struggles to find her life's calling, weighed down by her self-image and a very unfunny boyfriend who moonlights as a comedian.  The big question is \\"will they\\" or \\"won't they\\" eventually get together, but this uncertainty wasn't enough for me.
B005AUWY2W|5.0|I was very skeptical about watching this movie however, I wasn't disappointed; it had a cute story. I didn't quite like it as much as the first but it was defiantly worth watching.
B004ZG5EYC|4.0|The movie:<br /><br />I won't belabor the point. Either you \\"get it\\" or you don't. The movie is loaded with emotion, charm, mystery, excitement, and quiet beauty. It's the story of an unusual French woman who is trying to find happiness, while not losing her quirky nature. Amelie is utterly charming and engrossing, due in part to the performance of the lead, Audrey Tautou, but also due to the really spectacularly beautiful cinematography, color palette, and shot compositions. It's in French, and that's the only audio track on this disc. So know that you will have to read subtitles. But it's worth it.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray:<br /><br />OK. What do we want in order to induce us to buy a movie on Blu-Ray that we already own on DVD? In my book, there are three things:<br /><br />1. A reasonable price<br />2. All of the extras from the previous release<br />3. A video transfer that offers an easily appreciable improvement.<br /><br />Long review short, Amelie on Blu-Ray delivers on all three counts. Encoded onto a single BD-50 disc, this release contains a 1080p transfer of the film itself, and all special features. The special features are all in standard definition, 4:3. This is a disappointment, but is par for the course on a catalog re-release like this. The point is, they're all here, so you can ditch your DVD.<br /><br />The video transfer is truly wondrous. Detail is through the roof, displaying facial pores, cloth textures, and individual hairs that just were not evident on the DVD. The amped-up, slightly hot color scheme from the DVD and theatrical presentations is preserved accurately. There are no compression artifacts or color banding evident at any point. There appears to be no visible edge enhancement, and no digital noise reduction to interfere with detail. Blacks are dark and solid, but not crushed. If your brightness and gamma are set properly, you will be rewarded with loads of detail near black, especially on Tautou's dark hair.<br /><br />The audio sounds pretty much like the same DTS track from the DVD. I did not notice any changes or improvements, but then, I'm not much of an audiophile. It is a dialogue heavy movie, with atmospheric surrounds only at key moments. I will say that Tatou's performance is very softspoken, so sometimes the balance between these moments required more fiddling than I would like. But it's not awful.<br /><br />OK - so why am I giving this 4 stars instead of 5? My main gripe is the 14 full minutes of preview material at the front end of the disc - which cannot be skipped by pressing \\"Top Menu.\\" Instead, you have to manually advance through each stinking one, every single time you want to play the disc. There is a rudimentary \\"resume\\" feature, but this only saves your bacon if you failed to watch all the way through on your previous viewing, and if your player has continuous power and storage. Whenever you pop the disc in for a fresh viewing, here come the previews.<br /><br />It never ceases to amaze me how certain companies, and Lionsgate/Miramax is chief among them, punish their customers for purchasing their movies. I can't stand it, and it sours an otherwise lovely experience.<br /><br />My other gripe, which is more minor, is the paucity of subtitle options. On a 50gb disc, only having English and Spanish subs available is pretty lame. My wife had wanted a disc with French subtitles, so she could listen along with the French also being displayed on the screen. At least the titles aren't \\"burned\\" onto the transfer, meaning you can turn them off if you like. For those with constant-image-height front projection screens, you will be happy to know that the titles are entirely within the image field, not the letterbox bars.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />If you love this movie and have a Blu-Ray setup, it's hard to argue against this package. Cheap, beautiful, and comprehensive, it delivers on all fronts. If it weren't sabotaged by irritating decisions on the part of marketing boobs, it would be five stars all the way. As it is, it's still a must-buy for fans.

B003YL4LYI|1.0|This book is not worth anyones time to read, absolutely nothing of interest happens.  Done with this series wholeheartedly, there are much more entertaining writers out there.
0553801473|2.0|I'm not going to say a lot here because so many others who share my opinion have already written excellent reviews. Suffice it to say, a lot happens in this book, but none of it really means anything to the story. Save your money, wait for a copy to come up at the library, or get it in paperback; after 5 1/2 years, you can wait a few more months to read this one.
B004XZR63M|1.0|When I first read this my impression was that it is more of a pep talk and less of a source of solid information on how to build wealth. Furthermore, I am inclined to believe that the author made his money mainly from selling books and not from investing. In my opinion if you want to read good books on how to become wealthy then read \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\" and also \\"The Jewish Phenomenon\\". Then study value investing (see author Benjamin Graham - Warren Buffett's mentor.)
B0009P5YXO|4.0|I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend, who is a huge fan of Doctor Who. He loved it when he first got it, and it's been a good month or so since the novelty has worn off and he STILL runs around the house playing with it. Did I mention he's a 20 year old man? Literally, this thing has brought him HOURS of fun.    There is only one drawback. When we opened the package, all of the ink inside was dry, and the pen was virtually unuseable. Fortunately for my boyfriend, he only wanted to wave it around and annoy people with it, so it wasn't really detrimental to his \\"playtime\\", but it is worth mentioning to anyone who is looking to buy this product.

It makes me sick to my stomach to know that sickos like this Phillip Garrido monster, are able to walk the earth and get away with what he did to this innocent child.  Why??  What can we do to prevent this from happening again??  I read about Shawn Hornback and again,  this should not have happened.    Read this book and ask yourself, what you can do to change our laws.  We need to fight the system to protect our children.  Sex offenders that steal children for their own gratification should have no rights to ever walk the earth again. Period!  For those who think otherwise,  read this a pretend this child were yours, or your neice or granddaughter.  Picture it.  Do you still believe these perverts deserve to be protected?  To be able to live a free life?      Thank you Jaycee for telling your story and letting us see what a truly evil person Garrido was.  I can't imagine how difficult it was for you to have to relive this nightmare.  You are so brave and have my utmost admiration for telling it.  I pray your story will help change our laws that protect the wrong people.    God bless you, your daughters and your mother.

B005DC68NI|5.0|Having embarked on my own self-publishing adventure, trying to keep up with the nuts and bolts of it all has been difficult to impossible. David Gaughran to the rescue, with his excellent and informative new book, Let's Get Digital, that explains not just how to self-publish, but why now is the time to do it. The success stories are inspirational and put to rest the myth that you can't or won't make money self-publishing. The marketing tips on how to navigate all the various social media are worth their weight in gold. The list of resources is for me the best part of it all. No more having to track down where to go and what to do. Let's Get Digital is a terrific resource, and an easy read to boot. I'll have a copy on my kindle...forever!
B001HNE3NO|4.0|Sarah's Key tells the story of Sarah, a ten year-old Jewish girl in 1942 Paris, and Julia Jarmond, an American reporter in current day Paris, byway of seamlessly blended aalternating expressive chapters. Ultimately, the two stories intersect and become one perfectly blended piece of historical fiction, detailing the tragic Vél' d'Hiv' roundups in Paris during WWII.     I could not put the book down! I found myself holding my breath as I read the chapters told by Sarah.  I prayed for Michael, Sarah's brother. I despised Julia's husband, Bertrand. I grew to love Mame and Eduardo, and admired Zoe, Julia's daughter. And then there is William ... and I could not help but to take after Julia's mind and heart.      Sarah's Key is not a happy book by any means, but is not as gruesome and horrifying, as say Schindler's List. All wrapped up in a nice little package, Tatiana de Rosnay delivers a wonderful, heartbreaking and most memorable novel, bringing to light a much unknown event (by the masses) of France's involvement of deporting 13,000+ French men, women, and children of the Jewish community, to the Auschwitz \\"work\\" camp. It's engaging, horrifying, wonderful, redeeming, and a must read.

0891419063|5.0|EB Sledge volunteered for the Marines, was trained as a mortar man, and shipped out to the Pacific in time to participate in the campaign to take the little-known island of Peleliu.  He went on to participate in the invasion of Okinawa, and finished his service as part of the US occupation forces in China.<br /><br />Sledge's account provides a rare glimpse into what it was like to be an enlisted man fighting in the ground war in the Pacific.  He does an outstanding job of describing the bonds that form between fighting men, the way they come to completely depend on each other and the bitter anguish of loss they feel when their friends die.<br /><br />While this book does definitely fall into the genre of military history, it also fits into that of biography, and psychology of war.  Sledge does not wax poetic, but is able to explain in clear, simple prose what it was like for him.  He describes the battles, the weather, the challenges of tropical climate, disease, and mental stress suffered by front-line riflemen in the marines.<br /><br />As I read on and on, it became increasingly inconceivable that men could survive, much less fight, under such dreadful conditions.  Yet, Sledge helps us to understand how they were able to keep going as they fought an enemy that was so different in philosophy, culture, and tradition from them that they truly could not understand them.  Yet, that was their lot.<br /><br />This is an absolutely top-notch account of marine ground-pounders of WWII.<br /><br />5 stars all the way!  Thanks for the insights!
B004EPYZQM|2.0|I'm on the same boat as J.G. I REALLY wanted to like this movie. I am a huge fan of the series having bought the DVDs and the Blurays for all 4 (so far) so I Was really looking forward to this. Throughout the movie there were a lot of suspension of disbelief (as you should) in any movie. Mainly on what cars can and can't do but there are some things that go to far.     If it would have been in the context of fantasy (Harry potter casting a spell and a giant magical elephant pulls the safe out the window, or Yoda uses the force and pulls it out) Then YES by all means I can be like \\"oh well it's a movie. The force is strong within him\\".   However, when it's 2 real cars pulling a real safe out of a wall I just can't swallow it. I really ruined the movie for me and should for anyone that's ever watched Mythbusters. More than likely they would have just sat there spinning their wheels until their tires exploded or the cable would have snapped.

That Grandpa Portman recognizes in Jacob the same gift as he possesses explains their intuitive understanding of each other.  For me, the story evolved in a most compelling manner.  Perhaps the ending was rather weak.  I look forward to a sequel.  Ransom Riggs is as remarkable a writer as he is an individual.  He would be a most interesting subject on my analytic couch.

0307716511|3.0|Sister is a mystery whodunit told in a very unique fashion--an open letter to the deceased from her sister, who can't accept certain aspects of her sister's death.    It's not a bad story, but will probably appeal to women who have sisters they have become somewhat estranged from.  It's full of all that feelings and relationship stuff some women love to read about.  As a crime story, it's sorely lacking.    The \\"stunning twist\\" promised by the inside flap has more to do with something else, and not really the sister Tess's death.  It's a twist perhaps, but hardly stunning.
B004XIQDYW|5.0|For me... \\"Suck it and see\\" was the revelation of 2011<br /><br />It sounds so different but They are still sound good.<br /><br />Long live to the Monkeys!
B004FEL6GO|2.0|This bumblebee doesn't even compare to the earlier version \\"revenge of the fallen\\" There's not much detail to the armor. The immediate attraction is the wing on the rear of the car that makes you think wowza! tricked out camero like in dark side of the moon.  There's 1/2 as much detail as in the previous bumblebee of this scale (I'm referring to the version of bumblebee that has a fold out blue axe and yellow canon on the left hand.  This version is a little bigger with 2x as much detail).  The legs fall out of the joints and the tire / fender bay snapped off during transformation.  Again, the color of this toy is not banana yellow, not even a qualified cheap paint yellow, it's like an old faded plastic yellow.  you see any camero's driving around town with a beat up paint job? no way!  so why is this bumblebee toy so poorly designed? Short legs, no fold down face mask and the gun should be painted black or gunmetal but instead is some bad looking gray color.  yeah the conversion of the gun is cool but if fits on top of the car in a hole.  That's it? That's what you geniuses at hasbro designed? for shame!  Obviously this bumblebee doesn't measure up to any expectation.  the latest summer blockbuster is out in theaters and the toy sucks - no detail, no face mask, short legs and the eyes are black.  The other version has blue eyes illuminated if you shine the back of bumblebee's head in front of a light source.  This was a quick production piece of poop.  what a let down Hasbro for shame.... I'm not sure if I'll be interested in any future releases from dark side of the moon including the Ferrari figure.  I'm not saying that you have to use die-cast metal, just have a better colored plastic like battle ops bumblebee, maybe it's because this is rated level \\"2\\" transform difficulty but it still falls sort of capturing bumblebee's thrill factor.  I'll just look at the rear park bench called the wing and shake my head in dissatisfaction.
B00136Q79I|5.0|I will never forget listening to this legendary slab of metal for the very first time. I was roughly fifteen years old and lived in a small town an hour away from any store that carried heavy metal. I pre-ordered the cassette from a local store. I was super excited for any new release from the heaviest bands around at the time. I really liked Hell Awaits and Haunting the Chapel, but I didn't even consider that Slayer was capable of taking such a huge step forward. I rushed home after picking up the cassette excited to listen to the thing but also to play some kick ball with some neighborhood kids. I popped the cassette into my ghetto blaster, and proceeded to be blown away. I had never heard anything like that. I literally had goosebumps over my entire body. I felt like a lightening storm was passing overhead, threatening to absorb the electricity that was flowing through my body at that moment. Wow. I had a feeling there was never going to be anything better than Reign in Blood. I listened to the entire cassette once before heading out to play kickball, still incredibly excited to have heard such a thing. I have since listened to the album hundreds of times, and seen Slayer live dozens of times. Those songs never get old. Those songs never fail to light a spark in me. I now listen to all kinds of music, some of which rivals Reign in Blood in terms of my level of enjoyment. However, nothing has EVER affected me the way Reign in Blood has. It is perfect in every way.
0439023521|5.0|Most of the other reviews have it covered, and all I can say is that this is one of the best books I've read in a long, long time.  It's going nearly back to the first Harry Potter (a million years ago) since a book gripped me so quickly and I couldn't put it down.  As soon as I was done with Hunger Games (literally as soon as) I immediately hit the Amazon store on my Kindle and downloaded Catching Fire.  I hope Suzanne Collins has some new stuff cooking soon because it won't be long before I'm done with Fire and quickly moving onto Mockingjay....
0061433047|4.0|Terry Pratchett is an absolute joy to read.  The only reason this particular book didn't warrant 5 stars is because some of his works are better (read any of the Discworld novels where Sam Vimes is the main subject).  I have nearly every Discworld novel, and I return to them again and again.  They're smart, hilarious, scary, sad and satisfying.  They're mysterious with intricate plots, brilliant character development (as a student of the written word, I would rate his characters and dialogue among the best I've ever seen), and you can often recognize the characters just by reading the dialogue.  Sometimes even the font.    Funny story:  as a rule, I don't even LIKE fantasy, but Pratchett transcends genre.  All the witching and wizarding is just a job description:  what he really writes about is US...who we are as humans, what we are as cultures, and he'll have you laughing out loud while he imparts grave and solemn wisdom that we can apply in our own world.  He writes as though it's all true, and his style is so conversational that he might as well be talking to you, describing events as they unfold before his eyes.  That's truly a rare gift in a writer.    I eagerly await each of his books.  They're light, easy to read without ever being condescending, and so sharp and clever that I can't recommend him highly enough.  This book gets 4/5 stars.  The Discworld series as a whole gets 10/5 stars.    Thanks for reading.
B004NOH9LW|4.0|Clint Eastwood is certainly one of the most iconic people on this planet. As a actor he has has had some memorable roles and lines, as an director he is in a class by himself. Most of his films that he has directed have repeat viewing value and some have become classics. At an age where most people could barely walk, to have such a prolific directorial flourish is simply amazing. His latest work ` Hereafter' is abut death, tragedy, the effect it has some people and their attempts to cope with it, thus continuing his obsession with death. Three divergent story lines across three different continents are merged together in a ending.<br />Marie ( Cecile De France) survives a tsunami but finds that he life is falling around her. She is unable to cope with her relationships, her work and life when she returns home after this tragedy. George Lonegan ( Matt Damon) is a psychic who forsakes fame and riches he could have had as a psychic when he realizes that his gift is more like a curse and prefers to lives in near obscurity. Finally there are Marcus and Jason who are struggling with their mother's alcoholism and are struck with a life altering event.<br />The segment of Marcus and Jason was the most touching, and warms your heart to feel this brotherly love. The other segments are fine and well acted. The Tsunami scene is the great and probably the most fast paced in the entire movie. A common grouse amongst the viewers of this movie is the slow pacing but I felt that was necessary and keeping up with the theme of the movie. The tone of the photography is extremely muted and brightens up only towards the end. The actors are great and Matt Damon slips effortlessly in to his role as a psychic, the kids Marcus and Jason are incredible as well. This may not be Eastwood's most accomplished work but also not his weakest either. Four stars.
B004XJHBCE|4.0|This app is OK I guess. I all ready use Simi folder which does pretty the same thing and I'm already use to that. so like I said cool app I just have a need for it also it seems a little to flashy for my taste. by the way Simi folder is free.
0316056863|5.0|I wasn't sure how this book was really going to turn out, but I was laughing out loud the whole way through! Truly hilarious!
B0036T31YY|4.0|I tend to like off the wall films I haven't heard of before so I gave this one a chance.  It is a little slow at the get go, but it picks up.  It's hard to really review this film without giving away the plot or any twists that it might take.  The actors fell into their roles very well and I truly didn't know what to expect as far as an ending.  I would watch it again.
B003VANOFY|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3KSI76ZDT7C67]]The G930 is, without a doubt, yet another quality winner product from Logitech.<br /><br />I own some Creative/SteelSeries gaming headphones and some $300+ headphones, but the Logitech G930 headphone is definitely on the top of the list for giving your gaming experience to the next level, producing a very impressive immersive surround sound feel - and it's wireless!<br /><br />I played StarCraft 2, some racing games (NFS Hot Pursuit), Call of Duty: Black Ops, Metro 2033, Portal 2, etc. with this headphone and it truly feels like being surrounded in the environment.<br /><br />It's almost cheating having these headphones because it's clear on the direction of the sound is coming from.<br /><br />Unlike Creative's wireless headphone, I love that Logitech's receiver is a dongle with no wires to deal with. Logitech took it further and included a \\"charging base\\", which also acts as a USB extension.<br /><br />On the left side of the headphone is where all the controls are at.<br />- power switch (you have to hold)<br />- switch to enable the \\"7.1 surround sound\\" mode (turning it off will lose out the surround sound, but it will still make the sound more direct to your ear)<br />- Volume wheel<br />- Mute button<br />- 3 G-keys<br /><br />The software also allows you to fine-tune/control how much sound you want to receive on each direction.<br /><br />The headphone ear cups are large and should cover the entire ear, giving a secluded feel.<br /><br />For around $100, it's a bargain. Definitely recommend even if you're not a gamer. It's great even for movies.
B003VANOFY|5.0|As advertised, I do get 9 hrs of batter use. Mostly listening to internet radio (talk shows, coast to coast am, etc). Major selling point for me.  Also, wireless mode another reason as am 50m from town, can't get a clean am/fm radio, so I do a lot of streaming.    Microwave oven does pop it out&in on wireless mode, and when it kicks in, the mic is turned on even with the mic boom in up position. Just lower and re-raise the boom to kill the mic.  However, even in up (mic off mode) position, there is still some minor mic leakage. May be just my unit. Am working with Logictech on that for a solution.    Voice morphing is cool. Would like more morphing options in that area :) Love the Giant morph, even though it sounds devilish :)  You can't run these loud (volume level) as it will distort. Bass amplify the distortion so its either lower the base or lower the volume level. You won't be drowning out the outside environment noise, nor will you go deaf though :)   Don't shake your head too hard as it will fall off being on the heavier side.  Have to sleep on your back with these on. The headset is sturdy and well built with 8 months of use so far.  Cups do not site on the ears. I can wear these all day long, and do.   Re-charge is only a few hrs by just plugging in. Won't affect receiving the sound by plugging in or removing the wired cable as your now free to raid the fridge while listening :)    Would like a longer range as it will drop out at 60'. Would of like to listen while in my un-attach garage.  Sometimes 25' from walls will block and drop out on the other side of the house (multi-walls), but that's rare.    Can't complain much about the sound quality. Its good. Being digital, you have no static :)  Turning On seems to be hard. 10 sec holding the tiny button in. Same for off, but I just leave it on now and plugged in (wired mode) and it will auto shut-off with no sound being monitored.    Would I buy this again. a BIG YES! ($131.99 total 11/2010) I don't even havespeakers attached to my computer. Its all the G930 to listen.    I have not used the surround much at all so no comments. Surround does work though in a game. Its not like rear speakers are behind you, but maybe 30^ back from your side. Same for Front - like 30^ forward. Spread not that define like a home theater system.    One other bug is Audacity sound software (free) won't capture the G930 sound without a lot of messing around. It see's the G930, but no sound in software to capture till I set sound default to another device. Guess I'll have to get a sound card to make it easier to do.    Another note/bug, Sometimes the headset volume won't work if I have the settings board up and I unplug the cable.   I have to restart the headset, or I let the microwave knock out the signal and when its auto-restored, the volume works.   I usually do not have the settings panel up and have no problems then. Learned to start headset, unplug, then start Panel if its needed. All is ok then. Odd.....
B004XJHBCE|1.0|Bricked my phone... beware. I installed.. tried to use .. did not work well.. then my phone that was fully charged , stopped working. Finally got it back on and it promptly cut off again.. totally screwed my phone. Took me a long time to get phone working again.. unistalled app and now i have no problems. Beware.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|I've tried other similar apps but this is the best. Actually, I'm not sure that I could live without it on my android. It's easy to use and the export settings feature really saved me time setting up folders again when I had to replace my phone.
0060557818|5.0|This novel was my very first introduction to Neil Gaiman and remains still as my favorite.  His prose is enchanting.  This book has it all: wit, a little romance, and a lot of unexpected humanity.  Gaiman dances us through a magical underworld that is at once unbelievable, and yet there is that little part of you that thinks \\"what if...\\"  This book is everything you'd expect a Gaiman novel to be.  It paints a new picture of classic London, and paints many beautiful pictures within it's dark underworld.  Do yourself a favor, and pick this one up!
B003L77GGK|5.0|This series just keeps bringing it on! Despite season 6 noir feel, it just kept getting better with each episode. Some of the series best epis could be found here, like Caged heat, Weekend at Bobby's, The French Mistake etc.   With this in mind I can not wait to see what season 7 will give us. A huge fan since inception!!
B0056BMK6K|5.0|This is not a book about writing. Mr. Locke admits that he is not a great writer, but he also states he doesn't \\"suck\\". And this is fine because, as he also points out, he writes to entertain, not to impress. So this book will not improve your writing. This is a book about how to sell what you write. Between being the best novelist and the best selling novelist, the author states he'd rather be the latter, and many would say he has succeeded.<br /><br />Mr. Locke begins the book by telling us about all the mistakes he made spending thousands of dollars to market his books while his sales languished. Then he tells us about how he developed and applied his system, which caused his sales to take off. The interesting thing is that his system involves things many writers already do like writing a blog and using twitter, but he uses these tools in his own particular way which often runs against conventional wisdom.<br /><br />For example, haven't we all been told that we need to constantly tend our blogs, posting daily if necessary? Well Mr. Locke posts only 12-15 times a year in his blog! And Twitter, I have used Twitter for one year. Well, after the author revealed how HE uses Twitter I had one of those \\"duh\\" moments. I can't believe I didn't figure that out by myself!<br /><br />While many writers may find it difficult (I would even say \\"unnatural\\") to follow Locke's central directive on how to go about writing, I still think the book has a lot of great ideas to improve your sales strategy. At $4.99 this e-book is towards the high end of what e-books should cost. However, as the author states (and he sounds very sincere), he would have paid $10,000 for these ideas when he was in low-sales limbo. If you are also in this sales netherworld or want to avoid ending up there, this book may give you the framework that you need.
0440539811|4.0|This was the first non-linear book that I recall reading, back in the early 90s.  Wilson's ideas about the illusory nature of reality (which, in his view, is what we make of it), as well as his tongue-in-cheek portrayal of popular conspiracies, fired up my imagination and fuelled a lot of my own creative writing in the years since.  I've re-read the trilogy several times, and each time I do an interesting quote, idea, or piece of dialogue jumps out at me that I hadn't noticed before.  So trust me when I say that if you liked reading it once, you should enjoy it even more the second time.    While I don't necessarily agree with Wilson's libertarian worldview (which is plastered amusingly throughout the book), he does have important things to say about the need to be more skeptical about what we see and hear, and to understand that our own views of reality are just as skewed as everyone else's.  Hagbard Celine (who I interpret as Wilson himself, to a large degree) and Simon Moon are the most vocal characters in my view, and it is through them that the reader gets exposed to these ideas.    Wilson and Shea very cleverly weave historical events into the twisting plot, and they do a good job of capturing the overall feel of the countercultural movement of the 60s and early 70s - not surprising, given that they were both deeply involved in it.  What you get from this is a book that (on the surface) has a far-fetched plot, but if you read a bit more deeply and look up some of the real-world figures, historical events, and organisations, you will find that most of them really did, or do, exist.  This might lead you to question your initial skepticism about the storyline briefly, and in the end you will probably have questioned how you perceive the world - this is exactly what Wilson and Shea want you to do, as they explain in the appendices.    I would advise readers to think about this book not only as a convoluted, highly entertaining story, but also as an introductory guidebook on how step outside oneself and consider one's own beliefs and preconceptions about the world and how one interacts with it.    Geoff Gander, author of [[ASIN:B005202EMU The Tunnelers]]
1416550550|5.0|This isn't a review of the storyline, no quick over view of the plot, but I will share why I am particularly fond of the book.    I found it an enjoyable and also quite an easy read while still having a modicum of depth to it. As I was reading I wondered if my 14 year old daughter might enjoy it. It seemed to be the kind of book I would really have loved when I was younger.    She did enjoy it! I did not have to tell her to go sit and read before she would be allowed to get on the computer, she chose to read it by herself.  She would come to me quite animated and tell me what was happening to the characters, so nice to share a book with her like that.  Occasionally she would ask me to tell her what was going to happen becuase she just couldn't wait to find out, I of course didn't tell her a thing.     This is a five star book in my opinion because of how it captivated my daughter who isn't as \\"into\\" books as I was when I was her age. It is always wonderful to see her engrossed in a book, especially as it doesn't happen as often as I think it should!
0756405890|5.0|The Name of the Wind is the first book in the Kingkiller Chronicles written by Patrick Rothfuss. Name of the Wind is in the fantasy genre and the author's first published novel. The book is about an innkeeper, named Kvothe, who tells a scribe his life story. Kvothe relates how he developed from an orphan to a legend. The narrative is rich in foreshadowing and plot twists. The heartbeat of The Name of the Wind is its heavy reliance on poetry and music. In fact, an element of particular enjoyment for me was how the book was written almost like a musical composition consisting of highs and lows; tragedy and despair followed by adoration and praise. It feels like a classical piece could easily be written to encapsulate The Name of the Wind. Rothfuss' work constantly brings a reader through passages of great pain and great joy. All of this is felt through the eyes of young Kvothe. Many books have similar themes and characters but what really brings the book together is Rothfuss' musically based pacing. Some chapters are 20 pages long while others are a few paragraphs. The book has a dance-like quality as it flips back and forth between biographical narration from Kvothe to the scribe and the story being provided. These elements create drama and insight into the story being told.<br /><br />Rothfuss breaks recent fantasy norms and writes a book basically concerning one character's point of view. Kvothe is a<br />fascinating part of the book that keeps the pages turning. This character is brilliant, musically talented, and determined. However, I can honestly say after reading the first book I do not understand him any more than his girlfriend Denna.<br />Does Kvothe have a streak of greatness in him like a Napoleon or an Alexander the Great? Is he \\"special\\" like Harry Potter?<br />What makes him such an incredible character? Are brains, determination, and luck enough to make a man like this? The Name of the Wind largely leaves these questions unanswered.<br /><br />Areas of weakness:<br />Young Kvothe's story often times feels like it could be the next chapter in A Series of Misfortunate Events. Without fail, after a passage of great success in the life of young Kvothe, a great tragedy would soon befall him. It is understandable why Rothfuss chooses to do this as it adds depth to the character and brings a natural audience support, but all of the misery does get a bit tiring.<br /><br />Young Kvothe also develops a strong arrogant streak in the middle of the book which is wearisome to read. The flaw adds depth to his character but is a bother to read through.<br />The supporting cast in The Name of the Wind also were, overall, bland. Kvothe's school yard nemesis, Amrbose, was a typical rich bully who constantly fought with Kvothe. He would use typical cheap tactics to try to increase Kvothe's misery and most of the time they worked.<br /><br />Kvothe's closest friends were the typical mates who never failed to forgive Kvothe for any transgression, always were partial to sharing a drink, and talked about how Kvothe just couldn't understand the ladies. As a side note, Rothfuss' Wisconsin roots were obvious throughout the text of the book as it contained a large amount conversations concerning alcohol.<br />Despite the weaknesses, Rothfuss has written a very good story that deserves a read. If you enjoyed Harry Potter you will find an pleasing summer read in the pages of the Name of the Wind.story often times feels like it could be the next chapter in A Series of Misfortunate Events.

B004G600A4|5.0|This story has everything you want and nearly nothing you don't. I'm not a big fan of musicals so the songs that interrupt the plot aren't my favorite, but even those are more clever than in most musicals. The acting and graphics are great and contribute to the showcase of this movie: the story-telling. The story is fantastic and is filled with love, familial conflict, and great adventure. This flick has everything. Disney is simply the quintessential filmmaker of our time, period. Also, if you don't despise the mother at the end of this picture, you aren't watching- he is expertly portrayed as the manipulative pseudo-loving mother and it's a great contrast to the wonderful rapinzel character. Kudos Disney!
B004XJHBCE|5.0|I'm so glad I tried it out.  The widgets and folders that it creates look beautiful (to me it reminds me of the iPhone folder look but so much better on this device).    Took a good day to organize everything such as labeling but once you do it, your next download there will be a notification allowing you to use this app to label tag it for automatic updates into existing widgets or folders that you've created under that category.    I hate the native folder that came with my mobile device.  And if you don't plan on customizing your ROM then this app is the next best thing to managing how you want apps being organized and displayed on your screen.    I also use an app called Multicon on the Android Market to supplement this app.  Multicon allows me to fit shortcuts into tight widget space on the screen for those apps that I want quick 1 touch launch.
B004EPZ06Q|5.0|Although I thought The Hangover was a really good movie that was completely original, I thought the sequel was even better. How do you top The Hangover, you do it by setting it in a more interesting location. Thailand is just that and to anyone who has never traveled there, you should at least once in your life. Part II showcases the country beautifully, from the many islands to Bangkok, one of the great cities of the world. They shot a couple scenes at the SkyBar and Scirocco atop State Towers, a location the BBC named one of the worlds best bars. The Hangover II tops the first movie because of the location and is even funnier than the original. I am a little biased since Thailand is my favorite country outside the USA. It will be interesting to see if the producers come up with for The Hangover III which I'm sure will come.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I've been using it in comparison to another app I use on my iPhone.    PRO and CON:  1) It is definitely slower download (I don't know if it's the phone or the app).  However, this can run in the background and iPhone app can't.  2) ADs on most of the screens on this app but there's a way to minimze it.  You can bypass the search screen by using the YouTube app search then share it to launch in FREEdi.  You will see the ADs on the download screen but you can do other things on your phone while the download occurs in the background and never need to see that AD flashing in front of you.  3) Both apps pick up the download where you left off if you happen to lose internet connection.  4) One thing this does better is that it allows for download as video or just audio, a feature that my particular iPhone app don't have (not to say there isn't one there).    Overall it's 5 stars b/c it's free and the PRO outweight the CON for use on a mobile device.
0553801473|4.0|I finished reading A Dance With Dragons and I liked it. It might not be as good as A Game of Thrones, but it still is a very entertaining and complex story.<br /><br />I think G.R.R. Martin's writing style is really impressive. I am amazed at how well he changes from one point of view to the other and keeps the characters consistent, and most of all human, throughout the books. His depiction of characters, situations and places can be tiresome at times, but it definitely makes his story richer, as everything in his fantastic world comes alive because of that.<br /><br />Read ADwD while keeping in mind you will not find out all the answers to all plots (there will be plenty of time for that in the two remaining books!) and you will end up truly enjoying a very good book.<br /><br />My take on the negative comments:<br /><br />- Not much plot development: I admit I wanted several plots to move forward and felt we only got more teasers. Obviously I would have been happy if some of the plots had had a resolution. Nevertheless, I understand this book is just the 5th of a series of 7 books, and thus, resolution will come later. Still, the book had a lot of interesting things happening!<br /><br />- The pace is really slow at times and overly descriptive, but the same can be said about The Lord of the Rings. The key here is that maybe must people is as invested as I am (or even more) in the story, and we all just want to know NOW what is going to happen.<br /><br />I am fairly new to the world of A Song of Ice and Fire, but it seems some people will never be satisfied with anything George R.R. Martin does, so that is a point to keep in mind while reading negative reviews.

My favorites being Uberlin, Oh My Heart, It Happened Today, Every Day is yours to win, Walk it Back. Can't quite give any less stars for the other songs either. Extremely impressed with this powerful album. Thank you REM for this amazing work! Listening to it every day!
B004ANFF4Y|5.0|Been a fan since the beginning and have not been disappointed ever. This installment has a nice touch to it in reference to the series. The exclusive Buzz is a nice bonus for reliving childhood for those that grew up with the series.
0812550757|5.0|When I first started reading this book, I thought \\"Is this really a sequel to Ender's Game?\\"  The tone is very different, much more mature.  The concepts are sophisticated and very interesting.  I love this book as much as Ender's Game just in a different way.  I am glad that Card did not make a more 'traditional' sequel and instead decided to branch out and explore new concepts.  Read the whole series, it is very worth it.
0553801473|3.0|Pretty much that. A whole lot of traveling and a whole lot of nothing happening. Better than Feast for Crows but nowhere near the level of the page-burners that where the first three books.<br /><br />I'm suspecting I'm in for the same ride I got with Stephen King's \\"Dark Tower\\". Great first books pull you in, and then get pretty much abused by an author, in desperate need of an editor, who just phones it in.

B002ZG98C8|1.0|This movie was soooo god awful that I had to opine. First, this movie has the highest \\"eye-rolling\\" quotient ever. It was like a five year old pulled out his crayons and wrote a script. It's attempt at humor was embarrassing, and whoever was responsible for this abortion-of-a-script should have their union card revoked. The political \\"message\\" in this movie does more damage to the cause than it does good. I know that the director was going for an over-the-top approach to the movie, but come on.<br /><br />The acting was horrific. It is bad when the best performance is Steven Seagal.This movie was clearly made for fans of pro wrestling and the like. I wish I could get back the two hours this movie stole from me. I will add that I am hardly a \\"movie snob\\", and have enjoyed movies in the past that critics have deemed \\"dumbed down\\" or \\"immature\\".  This movie is on a new level of stupidity, and I personally don't see how anybody with an I.Q. higher than 50 enjoyed this film.<br /><br />I hate to be so hostile, but this movie is a pile of puke. The only real reason to watch this \\"film\\" is the same reason some people slow down to check out a horrible car accident. That is probably this film's target audience. To each their own I suppose.
B005DC68NI|5.0|Let's Get Digital: How to Self-Publish, And Why You Should is a new book by David Gaughran that describes and documents the processes any writer, be they old or new, needs to know to become a self-published phenomenon. The book is divided into three sections, each dealing with a different aspect of self-publishing, including: Digital Revolution, Digital Self-publishing, and Success Stories, then ends with some additional topics to completely round out the informational package.<br /><br />In Digital Revolution, the author does a fine job of walking readers through the major forces driving publishing into the digital age with e-books and why you, as a writer should consider it when it comes time to releasing your own work. If you're been following any site where conversations about self-publishing are going on, then none of the topics will be new to you. However, seeing them in one place certainly provides the new writer with all the information on the new digital publishing world for them to make a decision. David doesn't recommend any particular solution, leaving that up to you, but he does emphasize, as do many others that you should do what's best for you at the time. What's best for you will certainly change over time as the industry is far from settled yet; so being flexible is one of the major traits to practice.<br /><br />In Digital Self-publishing, you're walked though a series of reproducible steps that anyone can use to get their work into digital bookstores. Each section provides a high-level goal that writers will need to address at some point in order to turn their writing efforts into a successful product. David emphasizes writing the best story you can, designing great covers, editing, formatting, pricing, publicizing, handling reviews, and other means of getting the word out there to make your book just as professional and successful as possible. As the market is changing so fast, providing hard and fast rules that might be outdated in a few months would make no sense, but if you can follow the general principles outlined in these chapters you'll be one step ahead of the game.<br /><br />Next up are the Success Stories, 33 authors who'd entered the digital battlefield and done well, including Consuelo Saah Baehr, Terri Reid, N. Gemini Sasson, Katie Klein, and many more. Written in their own words it's a nice cross-section of stories that show how anyone of courage, some business sense, and a desire to publish their work can triumph in online ebook sales. I found this to be the best section of the book, simply because it had real authors with great stories about how they came to self-publishing. Most simply couldn't get their work to the public via the big publisher route through no fault of their own. Instead, most came hesitantly into self-publishing and have done better than they ever imagined, in the positive feedback from thousands of new readers, to monetary, and critical success. To know so many have successfully followed the self-publishing path is encouraging and inspirational.<br /><br />The author also ends with some advice on the resurgence of short stories for busy readers, accessing the international market with your work, some practical considerations to keep in mind like copyrights, foreign sales, and a host of resource links to aid you in finding help on your way to self-publishing success, from editing, to covers, to publicizing, to well, almost anything a writer may need help with.<br /><br />If you're a new writer, or an old writer looking into this new fangled self-publishing thing, having all this information in one place can save you hours of web surfing time. One thing I hope David addresses is to add or update the information in this guide as new information becomes available. The publishing industry is changing and the processes and methods that work today may not tomorrow. Also, be sure to check out David's blog, davidgaughran.wordpress.com where he covers the changing self-publishinglandscape often and in detail.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|I'v e been using FolderOrganizer lite since last summer.  Such a great app.  Change icons for your apps, add folders to your home screens (with your choice of icon), easily add and remove apps from folders on your home screens - it's just excellent.  Grouping apps by folder makes life much easier when you have a ton of apps on your phone.  I have folders for food apps, music apps, travel, shopping, and more.  Couldn't be happier that FolderOrganizer is Amazon's App of the Day!
B0050KEVO6|4.0|This is in response to the 1-star review of 7/20. You are retarded. You say it's a copy of a much better game, then you say the only difference is the black background and lack of quotes. So which is it? Is Doodle God much better or only minor difference?  That being said, this is a really good game and I only wish we could get new elements more often!
B003K1EYM6|5.0|The only thing I have to say negative about this is that it doesn't fit in my camera case pouch or my iPad case, therefore I have to keep it in a drawer. Not a big deal of course, I just go get it from the drawer but I do wish it were more convenient.
B00008976Y|5.0|This film is utterly brilliant, I watch it over and over, ever moved by it; and I marvel at its clever construction. If you are looking for a contemporary read that also lends itself to film... and, though a novel, is constructed very much like a film in the making (as you can really 'see' this book as you read it), then I highly recommend Jayne Joso's [[ASIN:0956012523 Perfect Architect]].
1936719010|3.0|I would have expected to either love or hate this book. Instead, I am ambivalent. On the positive side, no doubt many creative types need a good kick in the pants--and Pressfield is nothing if not motivational. On the other hand, this book would have been better if more examples were developed. Pesky aside - I really hated the switching of fonts. I found it very distracting. I agree with other reviewers' assessments that this was more of a ten-minute presentation than a proper book.
B001AQT0RC|5.0|I've always enjoyed this film -- and the book upon which it's based -- and found the Blu-ray version to be very impressive in terms of both audio and video quality.
0375826726|5.0|First off, the Inheritance Cycle is a fantastic and imaginative story for all ages, and all people in general. Brisingr, my favorite book so far in the series, is an amazing addition to an even more amazing story. Love this book, Love this series... I recommend it to all.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|Susan Tedeschi and Derek Trucks bring to the plate an honesty and soul-felt expression that goes way beyond two talented guitar players playing together. Through their chemistry, they resonate with a sense of truth that is immensely augmented and amplified by the superb talent within the band. Every song has something powerful to experience by the listener, whether its the story of the lyric, or the tasteful accent of the keyboards, horns, vocals, bass, and drums, they are layered with an intense underlying harmony and composition that is rarely seen in the music industry today. It is quite simply what music should be, a strong contemporary sound that is firmly grounded in the past. Every lick says \\"I remember, but look at me now\\"...

B004259BMM|3.0|I am one of Keith Urban's loyal fans and absolutely love his music and talent.  I have all of his CDs and have been to four of his live concerts.  This CD is not one of his best though.  There are only two songs I really enjoy and the CD is short too, with not as many songs recorded as on previous CDs.
B004XJHBCE|3.0|Great idea for an app.when I works correctly I find it very useful. However I have constant issues with the apps inside the folder not showing unless I hit the tools icon and push ok and then they site up. otherwise it is usually just a blank box  sony xperia play
B005869U6G|5.0|Incubus fans seem to be torn over this album.  Many fans sound like they are looking for the old fast paced, hard edged sound that Incubus has blessed us with for many years. I too am a huge fan of that aspect of them, and yes, this latest Incubus installment is definitely much more subtle.  I was taken a bit off guard after purchasing it, but found myself loving it just the same.  I guess its just an unconditional love I have for their music.  The tracks are deep, and have an almost calming effect.  Adding that variety to their arsenal was a great move in my opinion.      So to all the Incubus fans out there who are disappointed I would suggest trying this...  Sit back, relax, clear your mind, put on \\"If not now, when?\\", press play, and just Enjoy.. Incubus.  They are still the best out there!
B004FRX0MY|3.0|I like the app, plays the free tunes no problem. I purchased 1 song  and it keeps coming up with a playback error message. I dont know how to get it to play the song I paid for. Very frustrated!!!
B00518HBD0|2.0|I was really expecting more from this album.  I've been following 3 Doors Down since \\"The Better Life\\" (as most fans probably have been), and I have all of their albums along with their live and acoustic EP.  As much as I liked their last two albums, I've always felt like they were on a downward trend in creativity and the actual enjoyment of making music since they released \\"[[ASIN:B00070Q8JK Seventeen Days]],\\" and \\"Time of My Life\\" hasn't done much to help that.    The opening track, \\"Time of My Life,\\" really pulled me in, and I thought it was giving me a taste of things to come.  It was different, edgy, and catchy.  The next song, \\"When You're Young,\\" starts off almost exactly like \\"When I'm Gone\\", which is what I thought it was when I first heard it.  That aside, it's a pretty decent song that follows their usual formula.  Then after that... I'm pretty much drawing a blank.  It's just so incredibly bland and formulaic.  I seriously can't think of any song from track 3 to track 11 that stands out, and I really don't feel very inclined to listen to the songs again to try and find one.    That blandness doesn't end till track 12 (the last song), titled \\"Believer.\\"  This, my friends, is the kind of music I had been looking for from this band.  It only clocks in at a mere two minutes and fifty-eight seconds, but by God is it a glorious and refreshing change of pace from the rest of the album.  It's fast-paced, has good lyrics, and actually shows off some of what this band is capable of.  Being that it's the last song on the album, it's almost as if they had to sneak it in to get past any record company execs that would think it's not radio-friendly enough.    My favorite 3 Doors Down album (and one of my favorites overall) is \\"[[ASIN:B00006ZCFG Away From The Sun]].\\"  Along with \\"[[ASIN:B00004C4QQ The Better Life]],\\" they had their radio-friendly hits along with their harder, heavier, not-so-radio-friendly songs.  As a comparison to what they were then and what they are now, the hits from their first two albums, such as \\"Kryptonite\\" and \\"When I'm Gone,\\" are heavier, more honest, and they just seemed be having a lot more fun with them than anything on \\"Time of My Life\\" (with \\"Believer\\" being the only exception).      If I had to pick any redeeming qualities from this album, they would be \\"Believer\\" (which I would like to \\"believe\\" it is a sign of things to come on any future albums of theirs) and that Brad Arnold's voice seems to have improved, not that there was anything wrong with it to begin with.  It's just gotten a bit better.  In retrospect, \\"Time of My Life\\" doesn't really fit as the album title, because they seemed to be having anything but while making it.
0553801473|1.0|I love This series so much. George R.R. martin is just an amazing writer and I have a great deal of respect for his obvious passion for detail and creation of substantive charterers.<br /><br />That said I was somewhat disappoint by A dance with dragons. After several years of waiting after having left off on several cliff hangers I was hoping that this volume would make the wait so worth it and I was so thrilled to get my copy.<br /><br />Sadly that wasn't the case.<br /><br />without giving away any spoilers, not that there were many to be honest. the book was a slow ambling drag that teased at upcoming moments of excitement and revelation but never actually got to any.<br /><br />It may as well have been a travelogue since all the characters mainly did was tour the scenery and wait around a lot.<br />It's sad cause the others in the series I would have to force myself to put the book down and go to bed. This one actually put me to sleep and I had to force myself to keep plodding through it to the end.<br /><br />around page 500 I stopped expecting the story lines to progress and began to accept this book was not going anywhere. It was like someone took a movies b-roll and used it as filler to make a faux sequel to cash in on a franchise.<br /><br />I'm so disappointed.<br /><br />I don't know if Mr. Martin is just tired of the series and gave up or if he just isn't sure what to do next so he kept typing words until he reached the word count cut off point.<br /><br />I honestly don't know if I have another 5 year wait in me so I think from now on I'll just watch the HBO show and leave off on the books.<br /><br />Anyone know of any good series I can replace this one with? I'm open to suggestions.
B0050CQY1W|4.0|This is more of an R&B album which is surprising because she has been doing Pop for a while.   I had to listen to this album a few times before I started liking some songs.
B004ZQBOXC|4.0|I decided to pick this CD Up after a listening to a few of the songs on iTunes. I liked what I heard despite the terrible critic reviews, and I really liked it.   1. Rock The Beat: N/A  2. Sorry For Party Rocking: 4/5 This is a catchy tune with some genuinely funny parts. It gets repetitive after a while, but its still a good song.  3. Party Rock Anthem: 5/5 If you haven't heard this song a million times by now, you don't listen to music. This song is everywhere, and for a good reason. The lyrics are absolute generic bull crap. But it works and the beat is very catchy.  4. Sexy and I Know It: 5/5 Probably my favorite track on the record. The beginning part is absolutely hilarious \\"This is how I roll, animal print pants outta control\\" Haha! Anyways, the little dance beat thing that's in all of their songs is probably the best on the CD (exceptions to the \\"Wiggle\\" part)  5. Champagne Showers: 3/5 Probably the low point of the CD, and for one main reason, the chick they decided to feature in it. Its a good song other than that, they just auto-tuned that chick way too much for it to be any good.  6. One Day: 5/5 This is one of those songs that they had \\"#1 Hit\\" in mind when they wrote it. It deserves it too, its a catchy song, and very mainstream.   7. Take It To The Hole: 3/5 Ugghh, this beat is terrible, probably right there with Champagne Showers. Not a good song.  8. Best Night: 4/5 This was a good song, I didn't like will.i.am though. Generic overall, not fantastic or anything.  9. All Night Long: 4/5 Another great filler song. Nothing spectacular about it though.  10. With You: 4/5 This probably the weirdest beat I've ever heard. For better or worse.     Overall a good CD, here are the awards:    Best Chorus:  Party Rock Anthem    Best Verse:  1st Verse of Sexy and I Know It    Best Beat:  Party Rock Anthem    Best Song:  TIE:  Party Rock Anthem & Sexy and I Know It    Worst Idea:  Featuring almost anyone in any of their songs.    Worst Featured Guest:  That Chickfrom Champagne Showers     Worst Beat:  Take it To The Hole    Worst Song:  TIE:  Take it To The Hole & Champagne Showers    Overall score is an: 8.2/10
B00518HBD0|5.0|Here you have 3 doors down with their new cd and let me tell you it's one of their best!  It's an album you have to listen to a few times and then you know what i'm talking about!  Real great stuff and everyday i have a new favorite just like BELIEVER, Round And Round and then there's HEAVEN just great.  But this is just my review and i'm a big fan from holland and i love those guys to death.  my least favorite is 'Race For The Sun' but after 01:40 i love the song.  It's just a matter of taste but i recomment it to everyone who loves great music without the reviews of some sites!!
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I was on an endless plane ride and just read two of the best thrillers I've ever read back-to-back.  Before I go to sleep is awesome, but I expected this because of all the great reviews.  But the new thriller WIRED, by Douglas E. Richards, is off the charts brilliant -- and it's only $.99.   If I had paid $20 I would have felt it was well worth it.   Absolutely riveting!
B0057KXXFM|1.0|i never liked them before but this just tops the cake!! yo yo im fred yo ugh i suck ugh the music even sucks.. who ever thinks this is creativity should just listen to they hip hop dawg ugh
B00518HBD0|5.0|Being that I am a 3DD fan since their debut album, I have gone through ups and downs during their career. I loved \\"A Better Life\\" and their self titled cd from 3 yrs ago. (I actually think that one is their best!) \\"Seventeen Days\\" is my least favorite simply because it lacked a bit of energy that the other ones have. Just too mellow for me. (Personally, I hope they don't collaborate with Bob Seger again.)       That being said, their new release \\"Time Of My Life\\", rivals their last album! Lots of high energy songs, catchy choruses and great lyrics( Brad sounds great as always)! I've only listened to it twice and I'm already singing along with most of the songs! There's also some great guitar work on this album! Highlights on this album are Time Of My Life, Round and Round, Race For The Sun, Every Time You Go, On The Run, My Way, and Believer! ALL OF THEM are high energy songs!!! Don't believe anyone who says this is a soft album. They are wrong. My only minor complaint would be that the songs are a bit short and some of them end abruptly. There's only one track over 4 minutes and seven of them don't even clock in at 3 1/2 min's! I kept wanting to hear more but before I knew it the song was over. And the beginning of \\"When Your Young\\" sounds EXACTLY like When I'm Gone! Other than that, I will be playing this cd in my car until I tire of it.......which will be never!
B005869U6G|5.0|i like this cd even though it isn't their best, it isn't their worst. their new style isn't that bad if you like real music.
B0013ND30W|5.0|My little daughter & I are absolutely thrilled & enchanted by this Disney Blu-ray edition.Beautifully restored & better then I ever remembered it to be.Such a great great movie made greater with pristine audio too :)Great flowing animation & soundtrack is just perfect for bonding with your little princess where you both feel like starry eyed kids when you watch it together!
1592802974|5.0|Thank you, Jack, for writing this book!    I am still reading through the book, but I already found it very useful and exciting. Ed Seykota interview is just terrific! The book gave me so many ideas on trading. The best part of the book is that interviews are absolutely honest. I mean I don't feel that the author or the interviewees were trying to hide anything from the reader.    I highly recommend this book to all traders. It's awesome!
0062060554|3.0|S. J. Watson's debut novel is a thoroughly respectable psychological thriller about a woman who wakes up each morning, unable to remember the events of her life.  Her distraught husband helps give her sufficient clues to her identity to get her through the next day.  But ultimately a local therapist sneaks her away from her husband and, with his help, she discovers that her life is not quite as her husband has been making it out to be.    It's an undeniably intriguing premise.  Is her husband telling the complete truth or is the therapist working from his own personal motives?    But, save for a very satisfying final 10 pages, the telling doesn't quite live up to that compelling set-up.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|\\"A Dance with Dragons\\" is the long anticpated fifth book in the series \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\". Overall, I enjoyed the book. I think it is a notch below the first three books in the series and on-par with the fourth book, which I also rated three stars. I personally think a strong editor could have cut the slow parts observed in both books and produced a single, solid book to tell the story.<br /><br />Most likely people reading this review are familiar with the story line by now, so I'm not going to go into the details of what takes place in this book. I will note the reasons I ranked the book down two stars.<br /><br />I ranked it down one star because it felt like the story really dragged at times as it spent so much time in Mereene, but nothing really happened there. Dany's dragons got bigger, but we didn't progress the story much. It seemed like this entire portion of the story was in a holding pattern while other parts of the story progressed.<br /><br />I ranked it down a second star because Martin is going to the well a few too many times with characters that are dead (or appear to be dead) coming back to life. I wouldn't be surprised if Eddard Stark somehow rises from the dead or makes a ghost appearance in a future story!<br /><br />One other annoyance/surprise was Martin further complicating the plot with the introduction of a completey new set of characters to compete for the crown. It will be interesting how he ties all of these plots together, and I am hopeful it won't take another long wait before we find out what lies ahead for the Seven Kingdoms!
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I got this when I bought my smaller stroller.  It fits well and I think that it would fit on most umbrella strollers.  It hold two drinks and other items such as keys, phone, small toys or snacks.  You do have to take it off when you fold the stroller up but I just unstrap one side and it works very well.  I have no complaints about this item.  It is a great add on to any umbrella type stroller.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|This is one of the first apps I ever bought when I first got my phone.  I've used it extensively and still find it to be one of the best.  finally Amazon delivers a truly great app for free.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|The app is far to laggy to use on the Droid X. I hope they improve performance in future releases.
B003UESJHO|4.0|I am not really into fighting movies although I, of course, watched the Rocky series back in the day and cried watching Million Dollar Baby. This movie was different, and kind of confusing at the beginning. I won't go into details about the story itself, so many have already done that here. But I will commend every actor in this movie! Every one! From the 'typical east coast 1990's sisters' to the friends of the family and townies, I felt like I was back in the northeast!<br /><br />Mark Whalberg was handsome as ever and pulled off his accent really well, pretty continuously. I enjoyed him as the fighter who wanted another chance, to change his life and get his daughter back, make money at something he's never made money at, etc. His fight scenes, for the most part, were convincing except perhaps for the big scene with the body-shot, imo.  He was wonderful as the relatively patient, down-trodden brother of a crack addict and tough, mouthy mother-manager.<br /><br />Christian Bale, however, steals the show a lot. You first have to imagine him in his Dark Knight role. Sexy, tux-wearing, smooth talking, just awesome. In The Fighter, however, he is totally different. You may find yourself asking how he looks so incredibly different. So very, not sexy or suave. He plays the part of a fighter wanting to make a comeback, though I'm not sure why it's ever eluded to really. He spends a lot of his time letting his brother down as he doesn't turn up to train him while he's out doing crack. But it's his mannerisms and energy that really make this an award winning role! So convincing and not a comfortable person to watch, per say, but magnetic the whole time. At the end I just kept thinking, wow, Christian Bale MADE this movie.<br /><br />Overall, it's not for kids. It's got a lot of cursing, of course. Some blatant drug use and several sex scenes, one with what I'll call nudity.<br /><br />I do suggest the movie as an inspiration, it's made me want the soundtrack for working out!
B004K8WJ3Y|5.0|This cd is rocking from beginning to end and just like a fine wine they have age over the years ,but this is their most rocking cd ever.If you like whitesnake are enyoy the classic rock sound ,buy this cd iam sure it wont let you down
0307887960|3.0|As other reviewers have pointed out, this diet is basically Atkins light. After starting off eating nothing but lean protein (1-7 days), you'll drop a lot of weight. It is, of course, water... and one of the reasons it's water is because you'll be in the bathroom suffering a variety of GI problems thanks to so little fiber in your diet. (No, 1 1/2 tbsp of oat bran is NOT sufficient fiber!) After that you simply alternate days of nothing but lean protein with days eating protein and non-starchy vegetables, and always have your oat bran. After you lose your weight you slowly incorporate other foods back into your diet. There's nothing more to it than that.<br /><br />The fad diet nature of this book really became apparent toward the end when Dr. Dukan suggested taking cold showers to help burn calories, along with a series of exercises which basically amount to 30 bent-knee curls with a pillow under your butt and 30 full body granny squats. That, along with the 20 minutes of walking per day (at a brisk but not speed-walking pace), is all the exercise you need. That's it? That's supposed to help address obesity?<br /><br />Sorry, but I simply can't recommend a diet of this nature.
0061537969|5.0|This book brought me back to Seattle!  I now live in Kentucky but spent my childhood in Seattle.  Writing from a dog's perspective was original and interesting.  I have recommended this book to my family members and actually mailed my dad and brother their own copies, like a little book club!  It was also on my Book Club's list and I am sooo glad I read it!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Im not a professional in any way but use these headphones for casual use. I love them a lot they work pefectly with my ipod and laptop. It might be hard to walk around with a long cord as it is but I am sure its possible. I am impressed by the quality these headphones are. If you have the money I say get them
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I loved this series, and while this third book had its moments, too much of the action takes place \\"off camera.\\"  Katniss isn't as involved in the action, while she was the central character in the action before.  The events lose their impact because Katniss is hearing about the events second-hand.  Lots of anticlimactic moments as a result.  Was looking for a more inspirational ending.  Still an amazing series.
B000TIO4Z0|3.0|WAIT!  Do not buy this set yet.  You can save $$$, get nicer presentation of the CDs and get more operas from this set: [[ASIN:B002PP10BG Callas, Maria - 25 Complete Opera]]    I am no expert, but I know a great thing when I see and hear one. The 52CD, 25 Opera product is a wonderful set, and I am so pleased I bought it instead of this 70CD set.  Bigger is not always better!    In comparison of the contents, the 25 Opera set is missing Carmen, Manon Lescaut and La Gioconda. But it also has 6 (!) operas not in the complete 70CD box:     Armida   Melodrama in Three Acts   Armida: Maria Callas * Rinaldo: Francesco   Albanese * Ubaldo/Gernando: Mario   Filippeschi * Orchestra e Coro del Teatro   Comunale di Firenze, Tullio Serafin (1952)     La Vestale   Lyrical Drama in Three Acts   Giulia: Maria Callas *   Licinio: Franco Corelli High Priestess: Ebe Stignani   Orchestra e Coro del Teatro alla Scala di   Milano, Antonino Votto (1954)     I Vespri Siciliani   Grand opéra in Five Acts   Guido di Monforte: Enzo Mascherini   Arrigo: Giorgio Bardi Kokolios   La Duchessa Elena: Maria Callas   Orchestra e Coro del Maggio Musicale   Fiorentino, Erich Kleiber (1951)     Macbeth   Opera in Four Acts   Macbeth: Enzo Mascherini *   Lady Macbeth: Maria Callas * Macduff: Gino Penno   Orchestra e Coro del Teatro alla Scala di   Milano, Victor de Sabata (1952, live)     Nabucco   Lyrical Drama in Four Acts   Nabucco: Gino Bechi *   Abigaille: Maria Callas Zaccaria: Luciano Neroni   Orchestra e Coro del Teatro San Carlo di   Napoli, Vittorio Gui (1949, live)     Parsifal   Bühnenweihfestspiel in Three Acts   Kundry: Maria Callas *   Gurnemanz: Boris Christoff * Parsifal: Africo Baldelli   Orchestra Sinfonica e Coro della RAI,   Vittorio Gui (1950)   Comunale di Firenze, Tullio Serafin (1952)     Finally: PRICE. If you buy it from the Amazon Germany site, you pay about $40 (28 Euro) plus shipping.     So consider getting this other set for far less money.  I did and I am very pleasedwith it.
B005C6NFIG|1.0|This is Incubus? Where's the turn tables mixed with heavy guitar? Where is the musical chaos that just seems to work against Brandons unreal voice? The opening single on the track Adolescent was the only track on the ENTIRE album that anywhere remotely sounds like an Incubus CD. It's almost as if the band took 5 years off and COMPLETELY lost track of who there are and what made them a successful band in the first place. I can't begin to express how disappointed I am with this Coldplay like CD.<br /><br />I'm sick of people mentioning the band is \\"maturing.\\" It would be like Eminem moving to Opera and stating his sound has \\"matured.\\" No, this is not maturing! Maturing is mastering your sound and coming into your own. The Foo Fighters have matured. Has their sound changed? HELL NO! It's evolved and gotten better and better.<br /><br />Nothing about this CD is worth purchasing.....let alone having period. It's an absolute waste of an album. Someone mentioned \\"If Not Now When.....Maybe Later\\" and I'm almost to the point of wishing it was \\"Never.\\" I've been to 5+ Incubus concerts, met the band and been a fan for well over 10 years. This IS my favorite band on the planet. The fact I even have to listen to this Pop group crap at their concerts makes me sad. How could a band that made SCIENCE, Morning View and Make Yourself produce such garbage? It feels so ill conceived in EVERY SINGLE WAY.<br /><br />This is a pop album made by a group of guys in their late 30s. Who exactly were they trying to reach? 50+ year old soccer moms? Definitely not their true fans. I mean you listen to the Limp Bizkit CD and even Fred Durst knows who his audience and fans are. Incubus seemingly does not.<br /><br />I wish they would have never made a new CD at all.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|What an amazing story of the will to survive! Jaycee endured things that would have certainly killed most of us yet she came away from her ordeal a stong, powerful woman and mother. The beasts who captured and held her will find their own hell some day but Jaycee has risen from her hell and inspired us all. I wasnt sure i could read this story but found myself wanting to finish it simply because it was important to her to do the telling. I wish you happiness, love and success Jaycee and thank you for sharing this story.
B004FRX0MY|2.0|This app often worked well, but I had issues with buffering, even over my 4g network. That was unacceptable. So I decided to uninstall. No matter what I did, the icon kept popping up, even after supposedly removing it. And it would still run. Nothing I did worked to remove it. This is unacceptable, and I am not happy at all with this app. I should be the one deciding whether I want this app on my device or not, not Amazon.
B0043EV774|5.0|Growing up, I could NEVER watch any Alice in Wonderland movie b/c that vanishing cat just creeped me out...  so, I decided to give it a try again now that I am an adult....    and what can I say, I really enjoyed the movie.  I first this in 2D and was very impressed by the acting, the imagery, and who can not like Johnny Depp!!!  He seems to have a knack for playing the weirdest characters....      BUT, the 3D version of this movie just ROCKS!!!  it is like this mvie was MADE to be watched in 3D....  it is nothing short of spectacular!!!  the images are crisp and FULL of color!!     I've never read the book so I can't say if it stays true to story, all I can comment on is what I've seen and THAT impressed me....    If you have a 3D TV, I would defn recommend adding this movie to your collection! It is defn worth it!  I know I will be viewing it again!
B005DC68NI|5.0|The author takes a decided stand writing an instructional book about self-publishing, and in fact puts his work out there on trial for readers to determine for themselves whether it's coherent, organized, and professional enough to stand up to its own claims.    And not only does it stand up to those claims, it delivers a remarkable example of how to do it right.    Some self-help type books I've read muddle through the topic without offering really anything of substance.  In the end, you as the reader are given very little more than a couple of tidbits of good information and a load of repetitive tips and advice, most of which you already know.  Not so here.  Mr. Gaughran is not only succinct and to the point, he offers a very critical look at all facets of the publishing industry of today, and makes some rather keen observations on where it is headed in light of the emergence of the e-book.    He then focuses on specific areas of concern to authors trying to self-publish, and gives clear reasons for the advice.  His writing is very clear and understandable, and does not belabor the point too much before moving on to the next one.    He has also included a very interesting section of the book with a snapshot of thirty-plus authors who have had varying degrees of success self-publishing e-books.  Very candid looks at people who have succeeded using the exact advice he gives us in this book.    Well worth the price!

B0015AARJI|5.0|The controller that came with my PS3 wound up broken so I had been looking around for a replacement. I'm sure I'm not the only one who found it near impossible to locate a SONY controller cheaper than 55 dollars. This is easily the cheapest one that you can buy, however it is also the best(being that it's Dualshock 3). This controller has very smooth, sensitive controls and is also flawlessly responsive.
0545259088|4.0|I have enjoyed all three books.  It's wonderful to have such characters to become involved with, to see them grow as humans, fighting to keep their wolves at bay and to retain their individuality.  So, I was thrilled when Forever finally came out.  The suspense Ms. Stiefvater maintains is wonderful.  She has a wonderful sense of the inner conflict of individuals, especially young people in conflict with the more conservative, self-centered adults in these three books.  However, because I was so involved with the characters, I needed to see more resolution.  Not knowing how Grace and Sam will continue or how much more of a role Cole will assume is off-putting as far as I am concerned.  I feel somewhat \\"tricked\\" by the author.  Suspense is a good tool, but what is the point when you've spent three volumes getting everyone involved and sympathetic to the main characters of these books?  Perhaps I am too conservative myself, but I don't want to wonder what happened to the wonderful people in this book.  Like any friend of theirs, I would try to keep up with them and see them all the way through, no matter what.  Now I feel as though I have been left out -- the door is closed.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Well written and hard to put down.  From the description I was hesitant to buy this one, but decided to follow the herd and give it a try.  Very glad I did.

B005DC68NI|5.0|I've been anxiously awaiting David Gaughran's \\"Let's Get Digital\\" since following his extremely informative blog. This release couldn't have come at a better time since I'm about to launch my first self-publishing adventure. After reading a few other self-publishing how-tos and still feeling that I didn't get the whole picture, I was so relieved for Gaughran to fill in the gaping cracks.    As others have said, it's no surprise how helpful this guide is given how effective and successful his blog advice is, but I was surprised at the depth and detail Gaughran has furthered his blog discussions.     I especially enjoyed reading about the 33 self-publishing success stories, giving inspiration to all those self-publishers that are willing to do their research and complete all the necessary steps to produce quality novels that can hold up to traditionally published standards.    Although I wonder how much of David's self-promoting genius and writing talent can be taught, I will reread his guide over and over in the hopes of some marketing strategy osmosis.

B005869U6G|4.0|I've read a lot of reviews mentioning a lack of hard-rocking songs on this album.  While that is true, it isn't entirely unexpected, as the band has continued to evolve over the previous two decades.  Each album sounds slightly different than the last, signally a new direction for the group as everyone gets older.      I honestly was not a huge fan of this album after listening to it for the first time.  However, I have been listening to most of the songs on repeat the past week after giving it another try.    Be patient, the album will grow on you.  While this doesn't crack my personal top 3 albums, I'd still give it a 4/5.  You can hear how much time and effort went into this album - the instrumentals/vocals are very developed.  It gives me something new to appreciate about the band - it's not like the old songs are going anywhere...
B004WKOCP8|5.0|Maybe it is an advantage NOT to like S.C.I.E.N.C.E in this case. My first Incubus album was MORNING VIEW and I bought all their albums starting with MAKE YOURSELF until IF NOT NOW, WHEN?.    First of all, Incubus have never been a typical rock band including all the clichees one would expect. That was one thing I liked about them.  Secondly, their message was mostly a positive one.  Finally, the lyrics were and still are exceptionally sophisticated.    The first time I heard the title track of the new CD I was pretty sure it was a very good one. There is much variation in all directions. The melodies are unique and far from mainstream pop/rock because even a so called \\"simple\\" or \\"quiet\\" song can be brilliant and you won't be tired of listening to it 20 years later.    If not now, when/Promises promises/Friends and Lovers/Thieves/Switchblade/Adolescents/Tomorrow's Food I would rate 10/10.    I am proud of them. They are grown up and mature enough to not feel ashamed of playing songs that are gentle but profound.
B00005JKED|5.0|This is probably Denzel's best movie. Probably the same for Ethan. And probably the same for the director as well. In this film, Denzel proved how versatile an actor he is. He's never before played any character remotely similar to his role in Training, let alone has rarely - if ever played a \\"bad guy\\" role. This was about as \\"indie\\" as a mainstream Hollywood film can get, with the casting of real life gang members, including \\"Bone\\" in a fairly prominent role. The only bad acting in the entire film was probably Dr. Dre. A simply amazing film and one you will watch again. Not for the faint of heart.
0374290024|4.0|Morris provides a very interesting methodology for assessing progress that civilizations have made in what we now call Asia (East) and Europe/Middle East (West).  His approach is unlike any that I have ever read and can be a little tedious at times but it is convincing and interesting.  His sweep of history is even broader than Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\", starting thousands of years ago and incorporating facts up to the current time.  I recommend this book for a fresh look at broad historical patterns.  I'm not sure that they reveal a lot about the future, but they do provide the reader with some new tools to think about the future - worth the price of the book right there.

0553801473|3.0|It'd been so long since the last installment to the series I'd almost forgotten all the characters and definitely didn't know where we left off.  Unlike all the earlier books, I found it hard to continue to read this book, I keep going \\"I'd rather get some sleep...\\" or \\"um, I'd rather sit here for the next 30 mins. waiting for the movie to start then read this book....\\"  Not good.  I didn't really care enough about any of the men claiming to be king of everyone to want to read anything about them; who cares who wins since any of them is just like the next one and none of them is going to make much of a king.  We waited so long for this book and what a disappointment.  Feels to me like Martin's publisher was breathing down his neck bigtime, not to mention his reader fans, so he just threw some empty-calories dish together and called it dinner.  I hope the next one is much better.  And I still say he ought to have written the Daenerys story as a separate offshoot, like McCaffrey did with the dragonriders, drummers, singers, etc.  I always want to skip over the Daenerys chapters since I find them only distracting from the \\"main\\" story--if I ever reread this series (and that is questionable), I may buy used copies of the book and tear them apart, read the main story first then see if the Daenerys story is worth rereading.  I do not find her intriguing or beautiful since she's just been using men, and then she's turned against her own dragons who brought her fame and fear.  Martin had better make the next 2 books unbelievably great or his whole series will die.  And btw, maps on the Kindle (at least the on with the 6\\" screen) are always fuzzy and impossible to read and I have never figured out why when the Kindle opens a new book it skips over the cover, the dedication page, the author's Prologue or whatever--some of us like to read that stuff first (it's like having an appetizer before the main meal).  Also want to comment that if Amazon continues to increase the priceof Kindle books, I may consider some other e-reader when I want a new one.  My friend uses an eReader and can download books free from the library.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|This movie is a lot of fun.  It is the first movie that I have seen that I enjoyed McConaughey.  I always thought he played too wimpy a characther in the past but I think he sells a strong force to be reocnned with now.  Like a lot of viewers, I read the book and it was an enjoyable  legal thriller with clever twists. I thought they did a good job in the movie, especially when you consider that it was a complex plot to follow and carry off. I thought McConaughey was perfectly cast as the cagey, street wise lawyer and he comes off much better now that he is older.
B0000D96NW|5.0|Machine Head's fifth studio album Through The Ashes Of Empires was released in 2003 to a mixture of praise from some fans and suspicion from others.<br /><br />The album was a lot heavier and harder than the two albums which had preceded it, but all the same was not a wholesale return to the style found on the band's first two albums. Some fans of heavier metal may have still been unsure about all the softer moments and mid tempo sections and decided not to give the album a fair chance.<br /><br />Through The Ashes Of Empires maintained the clean vocals and melodic tendencies which were present on the more recent albums at the time, mixed them with some of the heaviness and groove from the early days of their career and came up with something modern, interesting and enjoyable.<br /><br />The album has three songs which exceed seven minutes in length and only two which run under the four minute margin. Rapping is altogether absent from the vocal style and there is no industrial or electronic influence to the music or production whatsoever.<br /><br />The band would later develop and perfect this style on their next album, The Blackening, which mixed in huge deals of dual guitar work and thrash influenced riffs to create one of their most popular and respected works to date.<br /><br />Early fans who were won back by The Blackening should take time to give Through The Ashes Of Empires a fair listen, and may find a great album they have missed out on.<br /><br />Standout tracks include the opener `Imperium,' in addition to heavier numbers like `Vim,' and `Wipe The Tears.' Furthermore, additional praise is deserved for the intense and brooding album closer `Descend The Shades Of Night,' which starts in a soft melodic fashion and rises to a dynamic climax.<br /><br />Overall, Through The Ashes Of Empires is one of Machine Head's better albums and fans who overlooked it at the time should reinvestigate it. For newcomers to the band, it would provide an excellent starting point as it bridges the gap between all of the band's directions.rections.
B0051MKMNC|2.0|**** SPOILERS*****<br /><br />The writer of this was obviously not on NZT, at least not the entire time. Maybe the first 1/3 of the film. While this film was engaging and interesting with a very good idea, it ultimately went nowhere and was not emotionally satisfying. A man suddenly becomes brilliant and needs to borrow money from the Russian mob = FAIL. a hundred grand is not a lot to raise and if you are brilliant, well, what's an extra week of trading to get the money. The mob aspect is where I was lost and the film never really recovered. He became brilliant and finished his novel in 4 days. As a creative writer myself I can tell you, unequivocally and without the need for NZT, that becoming a stock broker and then a politician is not an option or a goal. Creative people don't do that. The idea of day trading to make cash was plausible. Beyond that it was ridiculous, especially given the main character was presented as a creative type. I also still can not get past the poor writing of the need for the MOB to be in this film at all. The film seriously lost me the moment I saw the writing peek through when the day trading was working but not fast enough. C'mon! Why this films good idea needed to be watered down and reduced to mob men attempting to chase and kill the protagonist is beyond me. I was engaged but ultimately let down by a clever idea with a TV show presentation. This concept in the right hands could have been one of the best films of the years, but wound up being just another flashy photography film with no real substance. No soul. No rewatchability.
B000N3ST9I|5.0|This is a phenomenal release from the Bay Area metal band Machine Head; adding thrashier riffs back into their sound and excellent delivering dual guitar harmonies, improved production and better vocal performances than their last few albums.<br /><br />You may also have heard that this album is the heaviest thing they've done since 'The More Things Change,' and you heard correctly, this is as heavy as is reasonable, but is far catchier, more intelligent and more progressive than 'Burn My Eyes,' or its excellent follow up.<br /><br />The band admit to listening to a lot of Rush when writing the album and consequently the album features longer songs, virtuosic solos and melodic sensibilities. They seem to have developed their 'emotional' style from their previous album Trough The Ashes Of Empires further and improved upon it tenfold, keeping the clean vocals, acoustic passages and melodic guitar solos within the overall sound, but adding them on top of a much heavier and more thrash influenced album. The result is a mixture between crushing heaviness and moody atmosphere; with a mix of tempos, styles and interesting song structures.<br /><br />Highlights include the catchy 'Slanderous,' the heavy 'Wolves,' and the ferocious 'Beautiful Mourning.'<br /><br />At the time of its release I remember saying that it was either 'Through the Ashes...' with more attitude or 'Burn My Eyes,' with more brains but whatever it sounded like, it's simply astounding. Interestingly, this album has since went on to become a classic album in its own right, held in extremely high regard and achieved an almost mythic status among many younger fans. The Blackening has seemingly become the Machine Head to beat, knocking their debut album off of its long held position as fan's most loved Machine Head album.<br /><br />To summarize, this very is a good record, with absolutely great performances and great production. If you have any interest in Machine Head whatsoever, you really owe it to yourself to give The Blackening a listen. I doubt you will be disappointed.. I doubt you will be disappointed.
0375826726|5.0|Gerard Doyle's narration was excellent! The whole story was engaging. I think this might have been my favorite of the cycle. That may have been because of the wonderful narration. I didn't have to take the time to pronounce out the words as Mr. Doyle did it for me.<br /><br />I picked up the tome at the library and happened to be able to download the OverDrive audio at the same time so it made life for me... well, Alagaesic! Now. had I not had Gerard's voice (dealing with every character individually) this heavy book did have the list of characters and a pronunciation key in the back.<br /><br />The end of the audio had a surprise: an interview with the author telling of his writing processes. That was fun and quite helpful in connecting with my own processes of creating a world peopled by the unseen of those carnate walking about, making noise and calling out for attention when my own inner beings seem much louder. :)<br /><br />Looking forward to Inheritance!
0307887960|5.0|This book is so well written - it's interesting how Dr. Dukan brings you immediately to the focus of your life, your needs, why they exist, how to deal with the situations that you don't understand, and foremost, the information all makes good sense and makes one understand what's been wrong all along.  It's the first really successful and managable diet I've ever been on, and I honestly can say, I've enjoyed not only the diet, but the wonderful and healthful results, in what seemed like, no time at all.   The first week is the most difficult but after that, it's a breeze.     It's important to read all of the book and not just spot it with the how to's and how not to's.  From the preface to the end, it's a great book all the way around, told in moreless a story form and intertwines your life with many others including his own.

0756404738|3.0|Talking to my brother about this book today, and I am of 2 minds that are conflicting with each other.  1 mind says to me: listen, Craig, you picked the book up on Sunday and finished it on Wednesday, and read late into the night Tuesday, so it must be a compelling book.  The other mind says: if you take a high level view of the book, the structure, the storyline, the pacing and basically every piece of technical analysis for writing, the book is crap.<br /><br />So, how do we reconcile these two minds?  It turns out we don't.  We write a review for Amazon, give readers a heads up of what they are getting into, set the appropriate expectations and let Patrick Rothfuss continue on his merry way.<br /><br />I will break my review into the good and the bad.  I will start with the good, because I think more readers will stick with the review if I put something positive down first.  So - the positives - the storytelling, the character growth, the magic - those are all good things.  Rothfuss, for all the things he isn't, is a superb storyteller (somewhat like the Kvothe).  His literary voice is compelling, and likeable, you instinctively like his characters, you genuinely care about them, and you read the story to see what happens to them.  The characters grow (at least the main ones) in understanding, and maturity through the book (albiet in a very shortened time span), and the magic is definitely intriguing enough to keep wanting to hear more about it.  We have a nice \\"historic backdrop overlay\\" to the whole story with ancient evil and somewhat ancient good (needing to be resurrected in the present).  Fairly standard fantasy writing, but none-the-less done well enough to make me want to not stop reading the book.<br /><br />Now the bad (SPOILERS IN HERE).  And, the funny thing is, even if you haven't read the book and read this part that has spoilers in it, the book will be anything bur ruined for you, owing tribute to how random the story has come about.  I put it like this to my brother when we spoke about that book.  What if I were to tell you a story, and at a high level I gave you this summary: young boy, very smart & adept at magic, framework is a university, take 300 pages to clear up a fued between main character and university arch nemesis, leaves university, goes on errand to random kingdom, accomplishes 3 random miracles, randomly goes into the Faerie land, stays there for a while, meets a real debbie downer of a future seeing tree, goes back to the land of man, travels to a land of japanese/elf/samurai/ronin type individuals, learns their code in 2 months, travels back to kindgom, travels back to university, meets with friends, finally gets money, things look good at the end.  Was that a run-on sentence or what?!  That is the storyline of the book with an inordinate amount of pages given to the less interesting bits, and very few pages given to pacing and the juicy parts.  It was like the Iliad!  Yes for those of you who have read the book, I did skim over some stuff, but the structure of the story is intact.<br /><br />Sure, we have some common themes that the author uses to keep us on a (wide) road of a story - racially the main character is downtrodden, his parents were killed by this ancient evil, and he wants to set the world aright.  Not a bad premise, but the way in which we find out things along the way are sometimes built up too much (the beginning fued at the university) and sometimes not built up at all (this life changing meeting with the future seeing evil tree would apparently seem to be the most important part of the trilogy and took place in about 5 pages).  Strange.<br /><br />Anyway, I built it up and then tore it down.  At the end of the day, if you are a sap for fantasy that gives you that special feeling of wonder after you read a book (you know what I mean), then read this book, you will get that sense of wonder.  And, the pro's of the author outweigh the negatives, such that you will read the whole book and are only vaguely aware of the flaws until you finish and complete a more thorough analysis of what just happened.re of the flaws until you finish and complete a more thorough analysis of what just happened.

Incredible acting, amazing fight scenes and action and the best written show on television!  It's like a 2 hr. action film with great plots and twists you do not see coming packed into a 45 minute episode each week.  All the characters are interesting and the lead, Maggie Q, is perection in her role.  Do not hesitate to buy this set and get set for season 2 coming soon on the CW network.

Many, many misspellings, missing content, grammer errors, etc. A TOTAL waste of money!! The Little Prince is one of my all-time favorite books and I really wanted it on my iPad to read and reread.

Yes, but it will be a major improvement over the Kindle version. Don't waste YOUR money like I did ... fair warning!!!

0071762345|5.0|Before reading this book, I felt I had a pretty strong grasp of social media and how to manage our sales and marketing message. After reading the book, I realized I needed to change the way I thought about that message in several areas. The book is jam packed full of excellent ideas, points and action items for you and your staff to work through. We expect to see a lot of positive changes and growth as a result of adopting the techniques and information Dave has shared in this book.     I don't normally review books, even the ones I liked. But this one grabbed me on the first page and I didn't put it down until I was finished.     This will be the best 20 odd dollars you'll ever spend on social media... it's a fantastic value.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|I love the plethora of features this app contains. I primarily use the folder link view that shows just a simple icon with a mini-view of the apps inside on my homescreen. If works great; organization is easy, as well. I would have definitely bought it, but I didn't know about it until it was the app of the day. Lucky me... heh.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|I'm not usually a CD buyer, but after listening to a couple of these tracks (1+1, End of Time, Best Thing I Never Had, Run The World) on YouTube I was hooked.  I can actually listen to the entire album with out skipping any tracks.  That is very rare these days, especially with the type of music being recorded.  But I must admit, Beyonce did her thing on this album!!
B000FC1MCS|5.0|Just checked about replacing my copy which was lost somehow.  The Kindle version costs 10 cents MORE than a new hardcover of this book, and  is priced slightly more than a dollar higher than a new paperback, not to mention used copies which can be had for as little as a penny plus shipping. I love using Kindle, but, where are the savings?  Those kinds of price differences make this a no-brainer for me.
B004G600A4|4.0|I watched this movie for the first time last night, and I think its really cute.  Certainly not the best disney movie ever, but certainly not the worst.  I wouldn't buy it, though, unless you have young kids who will be entertained.  And I won't be watching it again.  For adults, the beginning is way to slow and drawn out, and the ending comes too quickly to make sense.  But its great for kids.
B00005214X|5.0|I have been a fan of George Harrison for a long time now and I bought this box set to replace my Albums. My only complaint is that when they remastered these songs, the sound quality is great but it sounds as if they drained the heart and soul out of the songs. Still, it is nice to listen to these songs when travelling in the car.
B000002UB2|4.0|I was very surprised by how well this recording sounded on my entry level system.  The vinyl was very quiet  and I found myself hearing things during the playing of the recording that I don't think I heard before.  The  vinyl itself was thicker than what I was expecting.  I am not sure how this would sound on a better quality  but for my money and my system, I am very happy.  I bought the original the day of release in early October 1969.    So, if you are in the market for a nice sounding copy, I think you will be happy with this.
B005DC68NI|5.0|Given the speed with which electronic readers have proliferated, evolved, and, yes, disrupted the traditional models of publishing, writers who have attempted to shift along with the paradigm -- or ahead of it, in some cases -- have had to hopscotch between message boards, blogs, websites, and their own experimentation to assemble the how-to's.    Let's Get Digital changes that.    The book begins with a conversational, yet comprehensive, account of the current shift from paper to electronic books, and the implications for publishers, editors, bookstores, readers, and writers. It is here that Mr. Gaughran makes his compelling argument for why the trend is likely to accelerate, and why writers stand to benefit the most. I found the section fascinating, not only from an author's perspective, but also for the thoroughness with which it chronicles what is perhaps the most disruptive innovation in publishing since the printing press -- and as it's happening. In this way, Let's Get Digital becomes its own testament to the trend.                  The next section, however, is where Let's Get Digital shines: a logical, step-wise guide of the how-to's. How to write, design, edit, format, upload, and promote one's work. All in one place. No more hopscotching. As one who recently uploaded his first title, I found myself nodding my head in agreement with many of Mr. Gaughran's instructions and insights, and scribbling down many others that I had not yet considered, particularly those pertaining to promotion. This section, as well a special appendix, contains clickable links to the many resources he recommends. In addition to scribbling, I created a folder on my desktop and filled it with bookmarks.    The final section, the success stories, is the fun icing on the cake. It can be read all at once, or dipped into a few stories at a time for inspiration (as I did). If I have any criticisms here it would be that a few of the authors speak of their success without quite fleshing out the steps they took to attain it -- the very thing inquiring newbies want to know. But this is minor quibble that does nothing to detract from the overall intelligence and utility of the book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The sample I purchased got me totally glued to the book and when it stop i was desperate to read more so i brougth it. Lots of violence and a little romance and the writing was will done. I could not even put this book down even when i really have to go. Its very addicting and a fun read. Love it so much.     Totally recommended to young teens and older. :D
B002N8A14M|5.0|You are getting more than your money's worth with this product!  The case is secure when it's in place, and easy to remove if you need to.  You don't need to remove the case to use the ports.  You can use the case with or without the arm band.  I am very pleased with this product.  Also, shipping was super fast.

B002ZG980U|1.0|Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, a thief specializing in corporate espionage. Cobb has an unusual modus operandi: he takes his victims by surprise on trains and airplanes, drugs them with powerful sedatives, hooks them up to portable dream-reading machines, and then violates their minds to extract deeply hidden secrets. Cobb sells these secrets for heaps of cash to his corporate sponsors. Assisting Cobb in these exploits is a crew of crooks that includes a forger, a weapons specialist, a drug peddler, and a cute college coed.     When Cobb is not dream-jacking his victims he is pining after his two children whom he can no longer visit. You see, we are meant to sympathize with Cobb because an inception gone wrong resulted in the tragic suicide of his wife, Mal. Cobb was unjustly accused of murdering Mal and he begins the film a fugitive. To make matters worse, Cobb's guilty subconscious is haunted by the projection of a vindictive murderous Mal.     Subtle clues are hidden throughout the film that Cobb's dreams and reality may not be as distinguishable as he thinks. It is the interpretation of these clues that intelligent movie-goers will enjoy debating. For example, in one nuanced flashback Cobb's wife tells him, \\"Our world isn't real.\\" To prove her point she commits suicide by jumping off a ledge... on their wedding anniversary.    My chief complaint with Inception is not the film's faux intelligence but the depressing, humorless melodrama. A lighter more upbeat tone would have better suited this film's preposterous story line. In my opinion, The Truman Show covers similar ground more ably and with comedic flair. The Truman show cleverly explores the concept of inception (i.e., covertly planting the seed of an idea within a person's mind) through the exploitation of Truman's relationships with his father, wife, and best friend. The Truman Show rightly places the psychological elements at the forefront. Inception, on the other hand, is centered around gratuitous gunfights, car chases, and explosions.     I rate Inception one star because I could barely sit through the entire movie even once. Surely, I will never view this movie again. If there is a sequel I will not view that either. Even my enthusiasm for further Batman films has suffered. I do not recommend Inception.

B00007GZZK|5.0|A classic comdey with a who's who in the cartoon world appearing in this picture including the Man of 1,000 voices Mel Blanc in his last film before his death. Great service and many thanks.
B001UV4XI8|1.0|After repeated attempts to look at this movie and literally falling asleep in the process, it dawned on me that I was looking for the thing to make sense, to have a plot, to actually be something that went from point A to point B and actually told some sort of story.  This was the mistake!  There is none of the above.  All it is is trans-spiritual gobble-guck rife with hordrometts and gizzle-wigkets, dolp-grommets, bing-slammits and wands that can do anything including creating flowers on graves.  This is the worst movie that was ever so-called created for children. It is a false spiritual odyssey.  The next door youngster when asked if he had seen it said: \\"It's goofy! I don't like that.\\"  This is a massive exploitation of the American and other publics' inability to not \\"be with it!\\" There is no plot, there is no single thing to draw and keep your attention and it is so dark, dank and depressing because it is so completely absurd.  To enjoy and appreciate anything there must be some sort of theme or idea that catches the imagination and leads it and you through the adventure.   The Wizard of Ox did this brilliantly years ago, and is still treasured as a masterpiece and always will be.   Fifty years from now, will there be an anniversary edition of this?  Congratulations, to the lady who started and continued this saga.   She's made a fortune, and like the Piped Piper, she has \\"whistled\\" the kids of all ages straight into the sea!   Oh! And then we have part two...  Lastly, Amazon will eventually have to print this. The \\"pics\\" (people in charge) will discover the consequences if they don't.
B00000AF98|2.0|1987's Crazy Nights is far from being the best KISS album, in fact some of the band's other 1980's work is stronger and more consistent than this. Yet Crazy Nights is not a bad album, it sees KISS going further down the pop route and the album's direction is similar to what a lot of other bands were doing at the time in the Glam/Hair scene. I truly appreciate Crazy Nights for what it is: a good pop album. If you don't like the sound of Hair/Glam/Pop Metal then the album won't have any appeal to you. It doesn't hold up as well over time, it's one of those weaker but enjoyable KISS albums that its moments. To be honest some of the songs sound dated and some can't be classified as much more than filler or throw away material. It's a fun album but it lacked what made KISS unique and interesting in the first place, here the band sounds blank and just like every other Glam/Hair band at the time.<br /><br />Paul Stanley said he wrote a lot of the album's content on Keyboards which can be heard easily throughout Crazy Nights, there's a heavy use of Keyboards which was commonly found in music at the time. Gene Simmons doesn't deliver his best 80's material here but \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" is fun and \\"Hell Or High Water\\" has its place on the album (still much better lyrics than \\"Burn Bitch Burn\\" with \\"I wanna put my log in your fireplace\\"...). Guitarist Bruce Kulick once again did some good work (listen to the shredding on No No No, this is a guitarist that no doubt adapted very well with what was current)fortunately Eric Carr gets little room to display his talent behind the drums.<br /><br />The title track is a very pop effort and fits perfectly with what was popular at the time. It's perhaps a little too happy but it's undeniably catchy and it was a hit for band, particularly in Europe. \\"I'll Fight Hell To Hold You\\" is generally not liked by many reviewers but I think it's actually one of the strongest tracks of the album. Its big riff and Paul's vocals on this one make it a much better song than given credit for. \\"Bang Bang You\\" may have been a stronger song back then but today it's considered cheesy and dated. \\"No No No\\" is much of the same and has much more in common with bands like Danger Danger than the KISS people usually remember. \\"Hell or High Water\\"\\"Reason To Live\\" is a great ballad and even if it's not one of the best KISS ballads it's a powerful and touching one that I quite like. \\"My Way\\" is more interesting and is very melodic, note the heavy use of keyboards here. \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" sees Gene doing some very tong-in-cheek songwriting (you know you like it). This track is a guilty pleasure, its dirty, catchy, and features great guitar playing from Bruce Kulick.<br /><br />Crazy Nights is not one of my favorite KISS albums, in fact it's probably one of the weaker releases. Blame it on Ron Nevison's , say it was overproduced or blame it on the group's tendency to follow what was popular at the time but it's just a very good album. No doubt it was cutting edge at the time but a lot of the music simply doesn't hold up that well after all these years. Crazy Nights unlike some of KISS' timeless material is very dated in its era and sort of serves as a time capsule of that time in KISS' already lengthy career. I quite like some of the tracks but there's just not enough good material to save it. As big a KISS fan as I am, I'll have to put my admiration of the band aside and be objective in my rating. I can't rate this album higher than 2 stars. It sounded too thin; it was too poppy and suffered from too much production. 2/5 stars.much better song than given credit for. \\"Bang Bang You\\" may have been a stronger song back then but today it's considered cheesy and dated. \\"No No No\\" is much of the same and has much more in common with bands like Danger Danger than the KISS people usually remember. \\"Hell or High Water\\"\\"Reason To Live\\" is a great ballad and even if it's not one of the best KISS ballads it's a powerful and touching one that I quite like. \\"My Way\\" is more interesting and is very melodic, note the heavy use of keyboards here. \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" sees Gene doing some very tong-in-cheek songwriting (you know you like it).

0553801473|4.0|I couldn't put it down.  I desperately want more when it was finished.  Therefore, I can't give it a negative review.<br /><br />That being said, it wasn't a satisfying conclusion.  And just like Feast of Crows, there is a lot of moving pieces around the chess board.  If you described where each character was and what they were doing in two sentences at the beginning of the book, you would only have to rewrite one of the sentences for most characters at the conclusion of the book.

B003HARV3Y|2.0|I was so excited to see this movie, and then so extremely disappointed by it. I have to assume that it was just an attempt to make money as a summer blockbuster, and not any actual attempt at telling the story in the books. Based on what was presented, there is no way to go back and make the other movies.  I hope that this movie is consigned to the scrap heap and that the entire series can start from scratch a' la \\"Batman Begins.\\"  Shame on you Rick Riordan for allowing your work to be defaced in this way.  Back to the drawing board.
B000YAA68W|1.0|This movie is bad. If you're informed enough about Iran, this can be a refreshing look at things but if not, you got to read a bit more before seeing this movie.<br /><br />The first 20 minutes of the film is to bash the former Shah of Iran and his late father Reza Shah the great as most ex-Communists and leftists do these days and mislead the viewers to believe that Reza Shah the great was a product of British control over Iran at the time which is an utter nonsense and it just goes to repeat the same old cliche of conspiracy theorists in the Iranian society. Yes, the vast majority of Iranians still believe that British had something to do with installing Reza Shah to power and they're unable to see the facts of the past and accept that Reza Shah was not installed by the Brits, yet he disliked the colonial powers and was an extreme nationalist who cared for nothing but his own shattered country. The other shortcoming of this animated film was to repeat the same terrible anti-Shah nonsense that you can hear in most Marxist-Islamist circles today. The first 20-30 minutes were badly wasted to tell the clueless western viewer that the Shah was wrong to prosecute the Stalin supported Azeri separatists of Iran in 1946-47 who had orders from Kremlin to disintegrate Iran from within. Yes, according to Ms. Satrapi's accounts, it was okay for a Stalinist group to seize parts of Iran but it was wrong for the government to stop them. One has to remember that Ms. Satrapi basically comes from a Communist family where his uncles and father are/were proudly anti-Shah Marxist activists.<br /><br />What disturbed me most through out the entire movie was the fact that author really failed to mention the source of oppression in post-revolution Iran which is/was Islamofascism and the mullahs who enforce that ideology. No mention of Khomeini in the movie is a mystery to me. Ms. Satrapi portrayed the late Shah as a commie-hating brutal dictator, yet she definitely failed to show who the real evil was represented by in post-revolution Iran. Yeah, I saw the moral police behavior towards western clothing or late night parties but who enforced that? Satrapi failed to tell the viewer. If I wasn't from that country or didn't know much, I'd not be able to guess who enforced a ban on alcohol or western music.<br /><br />The graphic novels which this animated movie is based on are truly reflective of the lives of many Iranians who like Ms. Satrapi suffered a a lot but again one has to remember that the story told by the author represents a tiny minority of the Iranian people. And the novels are the memoirs of one specific person and don't really tell us the whole story and I, for one, didn't expect her to talk about my story or stories of others. Persepolis is the story of Marjane Satrapi and for that, it is nothing special. She got to go to Europe because her family could afford it while me and tons of people like me had to suffer under the war of the cities and put up with the Islamic regime oppressive system. She got to leave Iran in mid 1990s again when she got depressed after a short time living under the mullah's rule but millions and millions of us had no choice but to stay there and soldier on. Persepolis animated movie is just about Ms. Satrapi's complicated life and has nothing to do with the vast majority of the people held hostage by the Islamic regime of Iran. Kudos to her for making money by selling her story but it really doesn't change much for those who still live inside of the country and have to suffer a great deal due to the mistakes Ms. Satrapi's communist father and uncles made in pre-revolution eras. You need to be informed about the history of Iran before watching any Iranian related movie, otherwise you might run a risk of being misled or misinformed.presented by in post-revolution Iran.

B004A8ZX2S|5.0|This is an amazing film, incredibly rich and powerful with challenge and meaning. A must-see. Every time I saw it in the theater, at least one person got up and walked out in a huff--and these were art-house theaters, not multi-plex cinemas. But such people simply do not have the cultural knowledge to make sense of the thickly textured and layered images, allusions, meanings, and symbols. But those who do have the know-how to assimilate and interpret this film who I know are deeply moved. Some I know have left it weeping. One wonderful thing about the film is it does not dumb itself down for its audience. What a refreshing break from the standard Hollywood blah. It has been added to my own top-5 great films of all time, may be my absolute favorite. Do not miss it. Sean Penn is fantastic, as are the other actors. Terrence Malick is a genius. View it on the biggest screen you can find.

B0032UYFA6|5.0|So many others have done such a comprehensive job on covering this season, let me focus on one episode to expose the brilliance of the writing on \\"Breaking Bad\\".     In EP 10, \\"Fly\\" (stop now if you don't want some spoilers) We see that Walt has become obsessed with cleanliness in the lab to the point of mania.  A single fly cannot be tolerated, and Walt forces Jesse to pursue the fly, even to the point of putting their \\"schedule\\" at risk.     Jesse soon begins to become perplexed by Walt's behavior, and finally decides to drug Walt's coffee so he can resume cooking.  It is at this point that Walt begins to speak in a free stream of conscious thought that he is normally too guarded to speak about.  Walt expresses the very incalculable odds that he would meet Jesse's girlfriend's father in a bar, and that he would go on to be the air traffic controller who would cause a jet crash which lead to the death of a huge number of people.  It is at this point that the viewer is on the edge of his seat wondering if Walt will tell Jesse that he basically stood by as Jesse's girfriend died in a heroin daze, but he doesn't, he simply says how sorry he is...    Walt goes on to express via that it is foreign to him to consider the odds of he and Jesse's actions.  He ponders the exact combination of words that would make his wife understand why he did what he did.  After all, if not for worrying about his family he would never have considered producing meth in the first place--he didn't want his family impoverished by his illness.    We see via this series that Walt is a man who is very precise in his actions, as would be expected of a genious in crystallography.  He cuts the crusts off his sandwiches, as if to make them perfectly square--and it is this precision that confuses him when things don't work out correctly.    But it is the very fact that Jesse and Walt's actions have wide ranging effects on others (such as the jet crash) that truly has shocked Walter White.  He is terrified by a \\"butterfly effect\\" by which he fears that in time Karma will impose his doom, and will take everyone with him.  Is the cost worth it?  Will all the money in the world bring back the dead?  What if his family is murdered?  All these effects are beyond Walter's control, and it is very uncomfortable to him.    So, in this episode, we see why the prescence of a single fly bothers Walter so much.  It is symbolic of his efforts to control his own destiny and those who he loves, but by the end of the episode Walter says, \\"Forget it, Jesse\\" as if understanding at last that so much is beyond his control.    This is why this show is brilliant, because so much can be said without spelling it out directly, all through the hunt for a single fly.
0375842209|5.0|I have read many, many books in my life, but seldom have I found one as beautiful, rich, and heat rending as this one.  This book plunges you into another world and shows both the beauty and the horror of it with unflinching honesty. You live through the eyes, mind, and heart of the main character.  You would have to be made of stone to be unmoved at the end of the novel.

0321525655|5.0|the value of this book lies in the unique concept the writer introduced.<br /><br />if presentation is part of your business/corporate life<br />this book is a must read as it takes you AWAY from the conventional Powerpoint bullet point presentation mindset into a world of results oriented creative presentation.<br />i have changed my style due to this book and received praise from my colleagues and customers after they saw my \\"new\\" presentation.<br />the book also changed my public speaking style in presentation... i am trying to be more \\"conversational\\" as opposed to reciting or reading from notes.<br />i read the book three times and still return for more every time i have a new project to design....
0316069353|5.0|I could not put this book down. I'm a new reader of Connelly.  I picked up the Lincoln Lawyer, loved it, watched the movie, loved it, and am now backtracking to read the other Mickey Haller series to catch up.  The Fifth Witness was an absolute page-turner, keep you in the courtroom until the end of the trial story, and more amazingly, knock your socks off at the end. I can't wait until the next installment in this Haller series!
B000DZ6VAK|5.0|I agree with the many posters who praise these excellent performances. Uchida is a strong pianist with a fine Mozart touch, especially effective in the cadenzas. The English Chamber Orchestra under Jeffrey Tate provides lively rhythms most of the time, but is able to darken their tone appropriately where necessary, as in the 20th, the first in a minor key.<br /><br />(I feel a special relationship to that concerto. Many years ago, a friend of mine and I were spending a week at the BSO summer festival in Tanglewood. We came upon a piano in one of the sheds and noticed on the stand the music for the Mozart 20th in an edition for 4 hands. We had the nerve of the very young and sat down to try our hand (hands) on the slow middle movement. No one came to cart us away; instead, a man came along and turned pages for us. We played raggedly but with spirit. Anyway, that's what the man, who we recognized as Aaron Copland, told us when we finished. I can never hear this beautiful music without thinking of that extraordinary event.)<br /><br />Anyway, these are all fine performances, a worthy addition to any Mozart collection, indeed a perfectly good place to start if you don't already have other versions of these great works for piano and orchestra. Highly recommended.
B004ZZS4CC|2.0|Well I was hesitant to read this book- how can you really summarize 18 years of a living hell? I have to agree with some of the readers-it was very repetitive. I was getting a bit annoyed by this at first, but then I stepped back and did my own \\"reflection\\" and thought how would I tell a story if this were me? You can defiantly see that she is someone who has, is and will be in therapy for probably the rest of her life.   I give her kudos for letting us peak into a fraction of her life and I guess in a way for her it will be healing.  God bless her she is an incredible strong woman.

B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Jaycee is an remarkable young woman, a survivor and someone to be much admired.   But, the American Justice system is broken and not enough people know this.  There is corruption throughout, esp. the Supreme Court.   Garrido was successful in his heinous acts because the sex offender laws came about more from drama-driven news (ala Fox and Nancy Grace ) and a small number of horrendous crimes, like what happened to Jaycee.  The hysteria that was caused by the drama, unscrupulous politicians who used these laws for more power and to get elected, and overly zealous prosecutors who cared more about winning than what was right.    MOST of the people now on the registry are not dangerous.  The DEPT OF JUSTICE did a study that showed that the level 3's are no more dangerous than the level 1's.  A BLOATED registry is not the same as a SMART registry.  The Garrido's can hide better in a bloated registry and it is unfair and unjust to put people on there for crimes that do not involve violence and abduction.  Read \\"Sex Offender Laws: Failed Policies, New Directions   2009  by Dr. Richard Wright\\" and see the evidence.       I'm glad that Jaycee's book is out and her organization may help victims of abduction and abuse.  But, two wrongs do not make a right.  Good laws are what help protect us and our children.  These laws are hurting the children and families of many men who committed minor offenses, many of which, because of the new laws,  were made into felonies. (that used to be misdemeanors)  If you care about justice for all and what's been happening to our justice system, go to:      [...]  [...]

1401223176|5.0|\\"Barman: Hush\\" lives up to the expectations and all the hype produced by this well-acclaimed best-seller of Batman's saga. No discussion about the quality of the story, the design and the coloring; no doubt that in an insane and worst case scenario as it is Gotham City's biggest criminals manipulated by a master criminal mind, all of them with an ultimate single goal: Destroy the Batman. It's a chess game in which every move has an unexpected outcome. Catwoman, nightwing, the Joker, The Riddle, Two-Face, Harley Quinn, Scarecrow, all join forces string together to a single master puppet: Hush.<br /><br />Story: Excellent.<br />Paper quality: Excellent.<br />Should you buy it?: Are you a Batman follower?
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Parts of this book are very difficult to read because of what she went through but she is an amazing person and it is worth reading. Not many people could have the attitude that she has after what she went through and I am truly amazed at what a wonderful, forgiving, and exceptional woman she is after her ordeal.  This is a story that gives hope to everyone in any situation!!!!

0618918248|1.0|I always wonder how books as appalling bad and narrow as this one win great claim from the press.  Don't get me wrong, to quote Obi Wan Kenobi \\"from a certain point of view\\", this book may have great merits.  Indeed, if you have never read a book from an atheist perspective, and are not familiar with the many well-documented abuses of absolutist religious perspectives, this may be a book for you.  You may even think of it as a \\"four star\\" book.  But I could not agree.  Firstly, Dawkins makes the ridiculous claim that the liberal religious perspective is \\"negligible\\" (p. 15)!  Really!?  Persons such as Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., the Dalai Lama, and Reinhold Niebuhr are \\"negligible\\"? The statement is absurd, and Dawkins chooses to ignore all the greatest leaders of religion, because they are facts about religion not convenient for his thesis.  As a scientist, he should know better than to ignore evidence simply because it is inconvenient to his thesis.  Second, (to subtract a second star) Dawkins makes the equally asinine claim that he is not \\"aware of atheists\\" (see p. 309-316) who persecuted others in the name of their ideology.  Really?!  Mao Zedong and Josef Stalin never existed?  And they never abused or killed religious person or shut down religious institutions because they opposed their atheism?  That statement is so dishonest it is hard to understand how an intelligent person can utter it.  Thirdly (subtract a third star) Dawkins method is badly slanted throughout.  Anyone familiar with the American \\"Founding Fathers\\" (he is fond of quoting Jefferson) knows they had many ambiguous (both positive and negative) statements about religion.  But typical to his slanted and disingenuous method, Dawkins quotes only the negative statements of religion from the \\"Founders\\", and in fact his whole method is only to drudge up the worst in religion and claim it represents all religion.  One might as equally say that all democracy is an evil, because the democratic United States was guilty of killing Indians and enslaving African Americans.  The logic is about as binding and compelling.  So if you have never read an atheistic book, you may learn some of the bad things religion has done, which may be worth your while.  Absolutist, science-avoiding religion is indeed stupid, but it doesn't represent all religion.  If you have read atheists books, however, or know even a fractional bit about religion you will see that Dawkins's book is vapid and hollow.  It is sad that such tripe wins uncritical acclaim.
B00006690G|5.0|This album is Eminem after he started to mature from his first two albums and before he got into sleeping pills, it also has the best production out of any Eminem CD in my opinion. This album is great from start to finish, and it was extremely smart for Eminem to mature his music for this album, because let's face it, if Eminem stayed the way he was during the Slim Shady LP or Marshall Mathers LP we would get sick of him. This is probably tied as my favorite album with the Marshall Mathers LP, but its hard for me to rate them from best to worst, because I like them all in their own way. Also, this album probably got the most undeserved hate from the reviewers (judging from the 1 star reviews that give no reason for the low review). This album deserves the same rating as the Marshall Mathers LP.    Standout tracks: White America, Cleanin' out My Closet, Soldier, Without Me, Sing For the Moment(my favorite), Superman, When the Music Stops, Til' I Collapse.    9.5/10
1451629184|5.0|Ms. Dugard, with only a 5th grade education, wrote an eloquent book about the torture and mind control she endured for 18 years at the hand of two extremely horrible creatures. She was able to convey what she went through in a very powerful way. I don't know how an adult could have survived all she went through, but a child? She should have still been home playing with her Barbie dolls, going to school, and being raised by her loving mother. Instead she became an adult overnight and had to raise two children while also learning how to raise herself. Her mother is to be commended for never giving up hope and for giving her the loveing foundation that Tracee needed to help her to survive. This is truly an amazing story written by a very amazing woman. It is like being raised by wolves what she had to go through.  I don't know how she was able to come out of it with such a great and positive outlook on life. She endured every female's worst nightmare with grace and dignity. This book detailed horrible events, yet it was very positive.
B003YUC2FE|5.0|I was able to get the box set during Amazon's Deal of the Day, which dropped the price down to like $45. I really like the box set, It is good sized, and the toy box the discs come in is really cute, it looks just like Andy's toy box from Toy Story 3. Would I pay the original $100 price for it, no probably not, would I pay the $80 price, again probably no, but that is because I do not have that type of money to spend. If you want the product and can get it for a deal like me, then you definitely jump on it. If you want it and you have $80 to spare I'd still say get it, because most of the Disney/Pixar BluRay DVD combos are about $24.99, so right there the Toy Story movies would be $75 at least for all 3, and for $5 you get the awesome combo pack, and an extra bonus feature disc.
0553801473|5.0|I am more than happy that none of the plots in this series are completed in this book.  Frankly, I hope nothing ever gets resolved and the series goes on for another ten books or more.  I want to know what happens next but I am having so much fun with the twists and turns, the characters, and the settings that I really could care less about an ending.  Martin writes as if he is producing real history.  Real history has no resolution.  It just careens into the next set of circumstances carrying characters along like a flash flood in a desert.  The characters make the same dumb mistakes as real people.  But they learn from these mistakes and go on to the next phase in life......making more educated dumb mistakes. I like escaping into this World where I have more questions than answers. And I will bet that those folks who gave Dances a one star review will still buy The Winds of Winter when it comes out.<br /><br />Wow!  The amount of hatred generated toward this book is astounding!  What is even more astounding is the amount of hatred generated at people who liked the book!  Book reviews are supposed to be about literature and not about the level of vitupritude the fan boy cadre can sling at anything they dislike.  It is amazing how unlettered we have become as a nation.
B00004R99F|4.0|We ordered this movie because it was a great movie from our childhoods. It is as we remembered with the humor being laugh out loud quality, and its a Disney movie so of course it looks great on a big t.v. although the movie itself is old.
0316069353|1.0|I did not read this book and won't, but for those complaining about the price.  Nearly all libraries in the United States have on line reservations. Get a library card and a web account and when Mr Connelly's next book comes out, just put a hold on it and then go and read something else until the library notifies you by email that the book is available for pick up. This does mean you might have a bit of a wait, but most systems buy these big bestsellers in large quantities so it is often not long, and they order more if the demand requires.  It is free, and a very substantial way to demonstrate to Mr Connelly and the publisher that you have options which include reading it without paying for it at all. Lastly, it will serve as a reminder that in these times of budget cutting, libraries give exceptional value for the money spent.
B005869U6G|5.0|I might have preferred a higher energy Incubus that we all know and love, but I am happy with what it is.  It's been the only CD I've been listening to since I bought it.  At first I liked it but it was nothing special to me.  Now, after giving it some good solid listens and noticing all the musicality within that I didn't catch at first, I enjoy it even more.  I suppose it depends what music you're into.  I'm not really into too much \\"hard\\" music so this CD fits in nicely with my collection.
0316067938|4.0|The book wasn't that bad! And unless I somehow managed to get an edited copy, I don't see anything about them being over-sexed... I was actually a bit disappointed that those scenes were so vague. Anyway, it's a work of fiction people, pure unadulterated fantasy. There was nothing in Breaking Dawn that made me feel as if Bella was suddenly obsessed with money, if anything I think that she became even more embarrassed and uncomfortable with the fact that the Cullens had so much of it to throw away. The only instance when she used it as if it were nothing was when she felt it was necessary to save her daughter. Yeah, her change made her a little too perfect, but after a life of feeling less than and being ridiculously clumsy, don't you think she deserved to feel better than someone at something? The whole imprinting on an infant thing was a little icky, but it could have been a lot worse and I think Meyer handled it tastefully. After all, it's not like Jake was thinking sexual thoughts about the baby, his role in her life at the time was purely protective. I think Meyer did what she felt was necessary in order to appease her fans by saving the Cullen family from destruction and giving the characters something to look forward to. Not saying it was the best piece of fiction ever, but it wasn't nearly as bad as I was expecting after reading the one star reviews and brokenhearted little girl rants. If you read this book and honestly think that you will be battered and bruised on your honeymoon, pregnant the next day with a demon baby that's going to rip you apart from the inside, become immortal supermom with super special powers and exorbitant amounts of money...you need hospitalization. Otherwise, if you can distinguish fiction from reality, you can handle reading this book.

B002KKCWFE|5.0|I rely on four other manufacturers for low-cut hikers, XT shoes, running and walking shoes.  For trail sandals, there's simply no other company out there who can surpass TEVA at a fair price.    I have the Tanzas in a pale olive with tan and day-glo orange highlights.  While many TEVA sandals run slightly large, those of us who really pound the trails find that the extra length saves the toes on downgrades every time.  The footbed molds itself around the anatomy of the sole. The strapping is so accurate that virtually any rubbing or irritation can be resolved with a slight adjustment. The arch falls, on my foot, exactly where it should -- I wear size 10 in a regular shoes, and 10.5 in any athletic shoe or sandal.    I find Teva's trademark, spider-rubber really grips when walking any wet surfaces, particularly if they're uneven. The style is handsome, if not a little spartan, but again, that is Teva's trademark -- rely on the least amount of baggage to achieve strength and stability.    Another solid Teva product.  Amazon fulfilled it quickly and well.
B0002KPIKA|4.0|This performance of \\"Agrippina\\" (1709) by Georg Friedrich Haendel (1685-1759)is a delight for the sight. Bizarre costumes, funny wigs, etc. Veronique Gens as Agrippina appears beautiful and has a great presence, worthy of this role. Her arias \\"Ho un no che nel cor\\" and \\"Ogni vento\\" has a sublime beauty. Ingrid Perruche as Poppea has many talent with the gorgheggi and her acting is really wonderful, many natural. The countertenor Phillippe Jaroussky as Nerone had a superb acting, too. His aria \\"Quando invita la donna all`amante\\" is very sensual and enjoyable. Only Nigel Smith as Claudio, for me, wasn`t so natural in his role, although he has a powerful voice. This performance is a treasure. I really enjoyed it.

B001E45XT4|1.0|I bought these as a backup for my plantronics 955 wireless headset.      First the thing is huge and comfortable on my small head.  I liked that.  People could hear me on mic I liked that.  Thats where it ends.  THIS IS A GAMING HEADSET?  The bass is horrendous.  2 minutes of BFBC 2 and I had to quit.  The bass doesnt exist.  An explosion next to me I could barely hear on 100% sound I even boosted the sound in enhanced options.  I am no audiophile but what this isn't is a gaming headset.  My 955 wireless will blow me out of my seat sometimes.  This thing makes me want to throw it at the wall and scream GIVE ME SOUND ITS WHAT I PAID FOR.  You'd think with 50 MM SPEAKERS it could do that.  But it just can't.  For skype calls its fine.  For gaming its a piece of crap and you're better off getting something else.
B001OQCV6A|1.0|This movie was bad.  I loved the Basil Rathbone Holmes movies but this was not the same Sherlock.  It was hard to understand their fake accents,,,after all it is an American movie.  A very mild phoney accent would be fine.  The plot was so thick that it started to take an effort so I didn't even finish it.  I don't think every movie should be a 'no brainer' but there was too much of nonsense.  I won't be buying the sequal. Downey should stick to Iron Man.
B00005N6KG|1.0|I really like these headphones.  They stay in my ear and don't fall out when I get sweaty from exercising.  The sound quality is decent.  The headphones stay in place much better than any other headphone I've tried.  The reason I give them only 1 star is that the product has terrible durability.  I've gone through several pairs and each time the same thing happens: one of the speakers dies (either right or left).  Sometimes there's a little warning that the headphones are failing (bad wire causes noise & silence when bent at certain angles).  The headphones are not fragile - they just stop working for no apparent reason.    Amazon won't accept my return after 30 days and Sony only accepts returns for 90 days, but you have to pay for return shipping and go through the hassle of getting authorization.  For the cheap price, it's not worth the effort.  So far, I keep buying them and going through a new pair about every 200 days.  My last pair lasted less than 90 days so I\\"m going to try some other headphones that hopefully will do the following: 1) stay in my ears at the gym, 2) produce decent sound quality, and 3) last for at least 2 years of regular use.

0240808452|5.0|All too often animation students learn their anatomy from dry books and diagrams that are quite excellent as a reference for medical anatomy, but less-than-ideal for students interested in communicating the movement of a figure more so than a methodical numeration of metatarsals. It is evident in many first-year art portfolios that are rife with accurate, yet nevertheless boring and lifeless figures. What has long been needed is a book like Force, that not only teaches anatomy in a way that's relevant to animators and comic book artists, but also how to depict that anatomy in motion.    This certainly will not replace a good life drawing class and instructor, but it *is* an invaluable reference manual for anyone who wants to draw figures that are bursting with life and ready to jump off the page. Team this gem up with Michael Hampton's Figure Drawing: Design and Invention, and you're on your way to building a reference library all your animator friends will envy.

The author really made me feel the characters so I will defintely be buying more books by this author.  The only regret I had about this book was the ending.  It ended so aburptly.  The concept of the ending was great but the storyline leading to the very end seemed as if a few pages were missing. Keep up the great work Nicholas and I appreciate your gift.
B005DC68NI|5.0|First off, I was given a copy of this book to review prior to it being available here on Amazon. I have been researching self-publishing for several months, am a regular over at the Kindleboards, JA Konrath's blog and the myriad Twitter feeds that daily tweet new links. It's a rollercoaster ride keeping up with everything on a daily basis, especially when it can change so much from one day to the next.    That said, I've read David Gaughran's LET'S GET DIGITAL and can safely say this book will give, in a nutshell, any newbies or those casually interested in what self-publishing can offer today an excellent introduction. This is not necessarily a how-to book on getting your book onto Amazon's Kindle, B&N Nook, Smashwords or the myriad other outlets available to buy/sell ebooks (or print novels available through sites like CreateSpace or Lightening Source). No, this is an introduction (and a very thorough and well-written one at that) to the self-publishing industry itself, complete with simple math comparing current royalty rates, as well as a number of real life situations with authors who found success beyond their wildest dreams. Mr. Gaughran compares traditional publishing with self publishing and manages to stay fair on both sides, but does point out how the business math works better (in some cases) when you do this yourself.    The first nearly two-thirds of the book is the nitty-gritty of the industry itself, how and why it works. Mr. Gaughran does a good job of making the sometimes confusing marketplace seem simple, as well as filling in a lot of blanks and answering a lot of questions most self-publishers (and those of us who intend to one day do it) face daily from other interested parties. Most of it is not new to anyone who has done in-depth research on the subject; he names Konrath, Hocking, and Locke quite a bit but also mentions some people less known, such as Black, Rose and Lieske, people who make a very comfortable living doing what they love (writing). He also gives tips such as how to use social media (such as Twitter and its #hashtags) and networking (do you know what a blog tour is? You will by the end of the book) to market your releases.    The last part of the book is from authors themselves: people who have gone from nothing to not-quite-overnight sensations. Make no mistake: this route is difficult and will crush lesser men and women, but for those who perservere, who can remember to keep working through the bad reviews and perceived rejection of their stories, there is a bona fide business opportunity here. These stories serve as motivation and the hope for a light at the end of the tunnel.    Final verdict: the book is nothing new for someone who's keeping tabs on every marketing opportunity, every small change in the industry, every chance that presents itself. However, for those of you who are searching for a good guide on what to do and how to do it (and more importantly, WHY to do it), this book is an EXCELLENT source. I know a lot and was still surprised by what I found in here - reminders of ideas I'd forgotten (I really need to use Twitter #hashtags more often) and those who I still need reminding (like negative reviews are par for the course). Great book, great writing, great information on an industry that is still at the beginning of its boom.

B003EVFHYG|5.0|This is probably one of the best classical movie soundtracks I have ever listened to.  It now tops Lord of the Rings, Chronicals of Narnia, Harry Potter, and Star Wars as my personal favorite.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|I saw this movie at the theater and enjoyed it so much I purchased the DVD from Amazon.  I've order many movies (and books) from Amazon and will continue to do so.  The price is fair; the shipping is fair and so far the items received have been in mint condition.
0345529057|5.0|I started reading the books after HBO's Game of Thrones series started.  Boy was I not prepared for the extravaganza those books entailed.  I finished book one (which the HBO series was based on) and then had to read the rest! I am not a \\"fantasy book\\" fan, but I don't think these books really can be confined to that genre. I am almost finished with book 4 and am looking forward to the one he recently published, although some fans who've read that book are disappointed.  It seems as if the recent book does not wrap up or continue some story lines.  If I have one criticism, that would be it.  Martin starts all of these character stories and seems to abandon resolution.  Plus, he kills off characters willy nilly after he's made you care about them.  Nonetheless, I have enjoyed reading the books and would recommend them.
0307272702|4.0|Gary Taubes has written extensively about nutrition, and our popular misconception (propagated by the government and a few health organizations) about what, and how much, we should be eating. In his tome \\"Good Calories, Bad Calories,\\" he exhaustively researched the fallacies and faulty science supporting the low-fat eating style (based upon consumption of carbohydrates), and its result on public health.<br /><br />In essence, \\"Why We Get Fat\\" is very much the same. If you've already read \\"Good Calories, Bad Calories,\\" it'll be a familiar re-hashing (though with more recent information, studies, and insight-) into the health issues surrounding the nutritional recommendations by our government and medical groups. Taubes, citing historical demonstration and contemporary examples, postulates that the present obesity epidemic is, in essence, resultant from widespread malnutrition: as a whole, people consume too few nutrient-dense foods, and over-consume non-filling, insulin-desensitizing carbohydrates (which do little to sate our bodies, and wreck havoc on our energy levels).<br /><br />Additionally, he punches holes (citing scientific white papers and well-respected research studies, rather than pop-science and daytime television doctors) in the \\"calories in/calories out\\" premise of weight loss. Starvation, he notes multiple times, doesn't work for weight loss, and it's untenable to expect it to lead to any long-lasting health change. The constant jump and decline of insulin results in an ongoing hormonal imbalance, which ultimately results in increased carbohydrate consumption and obesity. Taubes recommends to the reader, then, to load their diet with fats and proteins - while avoiding simple (and especially processed) carbohydrates. Much like Michael Pollanan, with his \\"In Defense of Food,\\" Tabues makes a strong and methodically argued case for eating whole foods: full-fat meats, unprocessed foods, and plenty of vegetables.<br /><br />Very well-researched and organized. This book is less a diet book than an expository work on the cause, and potential treatments, for widespread obesity. Taubes is focused and concise in his detailing, and does an excellent job guiding the reader towards compelling evidence that discredits the low fat/high carbohydrate dietary guidelines we've been so insistently fed.diet book than an expository work on the cause, and potential treatments, for widespread obesity.

0515149489|5.0|The Search by Nora Roborts was well written and kept the reader engaged regarding the story of the dogs, training of the search dogs, and the people who did it. I think it was one of Ms. Roberts' best books.
B005DC68NI|5.0|An excellent resource that belongs in every indie writer's library. Let's Get Digital covers all the basics, from editors to cover art, formatting, marketing, additional resources, and more. I know I plan to refer to it over and over again.<br /><br />The ebook also includes a fascinating analysis of the upheaval in the publishing industry as it moves from print to digital. David Gaughran has the mind of a businessman, puts it all together, and includes global markets as he talks about the broad picture.<br /><br />The firsthand stories from 33 successful indie authors round out the ebook and should encourage writers who are just starting out. Let's Get Digital is a bargain for the price.<br /><br />The author also runs a popular blog full of industry news and chat that indies should check out: [...]<br />Disclosure: I was provided with an advance review copy.
B0050LJIRK|5.0|I did listen to some of the samples prior to purchase. This album is the next natural progression after the chocolate starfish. It really is a great album. If you were into Limp Bizkit then you will love this CD. If you hated them then you will hate this CD. Couple things to note, this is the 13 track version and a 17 track deluxe version can be found on I-tunes and the Best Buy version which is the one I purchased. Happy listening.
B005869U6G|1.0|What has Incubus become? It's not the band I was introduced to by the album S.C.I.E.N.C.E.  It's definitely not the band that gave one of the best front to back albums in Make Yourself.  No, it's not even the mellowing, but still rough band that gave us Morning View.  Hell, it's not even the band that gave us the alt./prog. rock of A Crow Left of the Murder or Light Grenades...    This album left me scratching my head.  I get the whole trying new things mentality.  It gets boring recreating the same single over and over again like many main stream bands do, however this is a complete departure from the style and feel that this band could be identified with.  Without Dirk Lance, I knew things would change, but this is certainly a complete musical 180.  There appears to be no turning back now.      Maybe Einziger is just bored with guitar now?  I assume he writes mostly all of the music and that Boyd does the lyrics, but didn't the whole band sit down to write the whole album?  It sounds completely lopsided now with respect to the authorship.       I guess in the end, this album is just boring to me.  It's a well done album, but it's not Incubus and simply not interesting to me.
1451629184|2.0|Was very intrigued by Diane Sawyer interview and People mag story.  This book did not give any more insight.  It is not well written or edited. Too much information about pets.  I found myself screaming WHY not try to continually run away.  It seems like she wouldn't have even told the police unless they told her he had confessed.  This book does not even scratch the surface of the problems this girl has.
0553801473|1.0|What happened to the author who wrote the first 3 books?<br />Heres a short and angry opinion.  The series is dead and the author has become lazy.  The first 150 pages of the book consist of people marching or sailing in one direction or another.  They think about turtles, food, and elephants.  One chapter consisted of a journey from the docks to an inn filled with descriptions of a city noone really cares about.  If you like that sort of thing, dont worry you will get chapter after chapter of pretty descriptions of stuff you dont care about.<br /><br />The action is sparce and unfulfilling.  The story drags along and is a pain to read. The interesting aspecs of the series such as the undead streaming from the north, the return of the dragon queen, the training of Bran and Arya, go almost nowhere.  The only highpoint of the book is what happens to Theon Greyjoy. And thats about all.  I am done with GRRM.  He obviously does not care about releasing a quality product anymore.<br /><br />Authors like GRRM should learn from others like Tad Williams, Terry Brooks, Hickman and Weiss.  They can tell compelling stories that actually come to a fulfilling climax.  While Robert Jordan and GRRM promise you the world and deliver dissapointment.
0143038419|4.0|This book was given to me by a friend. Out of the gate, I did not like this person and the feeling that she was justifying and purging and that soon she was going to explain to me how to transcend myself.<br /><br />At a certain point I felt I could not read one more page of this book and why oh why did I accept it from my friend. What a burden. The person who lent it to me is extremely sensitive. Were I to be honest, she would be mad. After having read E,P,L - she bought flowers for herself, for me and for who knows who else, desired going to Italy with a passion then gave it to me so that I, too, would embrace the universe. Not reading this book was not an option. I forged on and low and behold, was swept up in a terrific life and began liking Gilbert more and more.<br /><br />Bottom line is I loved Eat Pray Love. Loved the journey. Loved the information imparted. Loved the characters. Loved loving and tons else about this read. I am ever so happy I shelved an involuntary self-righteous cyinicism and dove into this wonderful search for peace of mind. And I adore her new husbad with his tender, logical insights. Live in peace and prosper. Thanks Gilbert. You helped open my heart. Elbows on a float, your book in hand, I found myself kissing a lovely little new green, perfectly heart shaped leaf floating toward me in the pool at sunset. It was sent by my husband on the second anniversary of his death. I am certain of it.
0071762345|5.0|This book will help immensely with your online reputation and will be a business-builder. Dave Kerpen is the author and he gives hundreds of tips and ideas to build your business and online reputation. The book is humorous and also extremely informative.

B0055D3EOG|4.0|Oh my gosh how this brought back awful memories. I am 60 yrs old, a Viet Vet & have never been afraid of ANYTHING in my life except for the BURNT MAN I saw on my ceiling in my youth 50 yrs ago! I think of that awful creature now & then but always manage to put him out of my mind, except for the fact that this MOVIE \\"INSIDIOUS\\" has seem to brought him back, at least in my thoughts. This movie terrified me!! I kept looking at the ceiling expecting the worse, Thank GOD it didn't happen. If you got guts enough watch INSIDIOUS alone, late at nite in the DARK I dare ya!!  on the real side I do believe all younger children do have this ability, watch the movie I'm no spoiler. As we grow older & reality of the daily grind seems to take hold we most certainly seem to loose most of this ability except in our darkest dreams, which is our survival mode. I don't know how many other people have had similar experiences but if you have I feel for you because I know it's a life haunting thing.......    This movie started out very strong but lost it's momentum closer to the end. I definitely recommend this movie be watched by ADULTS before deciding if your children should view it. Of course with to days video games of guts & gore go ahead let em watch it!
B003T70B46|5.0|The Scissor Sisters are an awesome band with a great deal of talent that have simply shot themselves in the foot. It's sad but most of the world is still too steeped in homophobia to see past the band's image into the meat of the actual music which is filled with monstrous hook-laden infectious rhythms that would make even Devo blush. In a world gone mad with Justin Beiber and thousands of other talentless drones as an excuse for pop music, I'm infuriated to think how criminally underrated these songs are and I hope that mainstream music will get some taste back. Take it from a heterosexual male, ignore the controversial cover of the album and listen to the music for the music and not for the people behind it.
B002ZG9760|1.0|The teen dark romantic fantasy genre has a captive audience that is more than willing to shell out out $  and Hollywood is more than happy to churn out mindless trash. This is what is wrong with the system. Avoid this, don't pay for it, let your daughter watch on cable soon enough. 86 minutes of your life never to be recovered.
142311339X|5.0|I loved it. It was great, I can't wait for the next book, this serie seems as good as the Percy Jackson & The Olympians.
B004VRK3ZU|1.0|I like this movie and my daughter loves it.  We were excited about the blu-ray.  We have had the DVD version for years.  The blu-ray arrived and if you already have the DVD.....please save your money.  The image and sound on the blu-ray are no improvement.  In fact in many places the image is inferior....far inferior.  The DVD has bright colors and has an fun feel to it.  The remastered BR is dark and the colors are dead.  The image blurs considerably on fast moving scenes.  It is the worst BR I have seen since Wedding Singer.
B0019GO582|5.0|I lived in the 1980s when I was young child and I remember the movie... \\"EXPLORERS\\" in 1985 and it was on Television screen. Now I recently bought this DVD of Explorers-I Love The 80s...it brought me a memories of flashbacks is like going back into 1980s era. I really recommend anyone to watch this funny and memorable movie of the 1980s...Explorers!

B003ZYJS5Q|5.0|This is the firs vinyl box set that i have bought. Its worth every cent i paid for it . The packaging is very good , the vinyls  are perfect, and i even get a free mp3 download for the mono set. Listening to them it just mind blowing , the sound is so great it feel like he is there in your room . I have been collecting the sacd of the dylan catalogue and now I have the vinyl set as well i hope they will release the next batch of his recordings from Slow train coming , blood on the tracks, infidels , oh mercy i would love to have them on vinyl as well even if there are in stereo sound. Vinyl just sounds better then any other formats.
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|Goog solid new age music. Way too much instrumental on this album. I listen to Loreena to hear her voice.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|I purchased the 3 disc Special Edition with the digital copy.  For those of you buying this set, you probably won't get the digital copy code included in the package (I didn't).  Since this movie came out in 2008, digital codes are only valid 1 year after the movie was released on DVD.  I was dissappointed to know that an Amazon merchant was selling this product showing that it could be viewed on a portable device when in fact it cannot since the code would be expired.  I went ahead and emailed Disney to see if I can get the code and to my surprise within an hour the Disney guest services team apologized and emailed me a code.  Worked out perfectly.  I did not have to return the set.  Here is the link to request a code from Disney:<br /><br />[...].<br /><br />For $14 you get the DVD, Wall-E short film extras and a digital copy.  It's not a bad deal.  If you happen to get a code with your purchase and it's not working then definitely use the link above for a replacement.  You will need your digital copy disc that came with your purchase in order to download the movie. Both disc and code are needed to download the digital copy.<br /><br />My son loves the movie and now he can watch it on the go.  I'm a happy customer.
B000HL09MG|4.0|Only Kubrick can have me watch Tom Cruise without cringing through the entire movie. This movie showcases Tom's talent in a way where the watcher forgets the utter ridiculousness of his real/personal life that involves Scientology. Of course Kidman is a sight for sore eyes while she leaves the viewer in awe of her unique strength and vulnerability.
B0037YOMWS|1.0|Upon getting the hp30b I realized that one of the functions was not computing correctly. I called HP customer service but they were not very helpful. They never acknowledged the problem, told me they would look into it and get back to me but never did. Although I thought overall the hp30b is a good calc (if it had no defects), I started wondering if any more functions might be defective. Therefore I sent it back to the seller, regrettably, because I liked the calculator and wished that it had no defects.  So buyers please be aware of this problem before you buy the calculator. For me what was even more annoying than the calculator being defective was the way the HP customer service treated me.  I always had a good impression of hp products and their customer service, but this event changed my mind. I have never had any problems with Amazon products( and I have bought many). This was the second time I ever had problems buying HP stuff on Amazon. To Amazon's credit they have always treated me with respect and good customer service, so I was able to return the defective hp item without any problems.
B000JJ4GW0|2.0|When this came out back in 2006, I caved and bought this for the two new tracks. I reviewed this record a few years ago and gave it a pretty glowing review. I now regret that -- this is my re-review. I am as big a U2 fan as you can get -- I have all of their albums, both best-ofs, and nearly every CD single on the market of theirs. It is safe to say that I am a fanatical U2 fan, not to mention I have seen them six times. So the two stars are NOT because I don't like U2.     No, the two stars are because of the greed of the record companies. I have always thought that U2 has needed a boxed set. Kind of like Bob Dylan's 'Biograph' and Jimi Hendrix's more recent 'West Coast Seattle Boy.' U2, like Dylan, has plenty of great b-sides and other assorted rarities that never seem to make the cut on their albums. So instead of rehashing a useless, pointless singles collection, why not gather up all of the CD singles on several discs and issue their b-sides (including the remixes) all on a 4 or 5 disc collection? It makes sense. U2 needs a 'Complete Singles' boxed set.    Instead, we are treated to 16 songs U2 fans have time and time again and two new (for 2006, anyway) songs. The first, a cover of the old punk tune 'The Saints Are Coming' features Berkeley punk rockers Green Day. Yes, this track rocks. You get flashes of Green Day and U2 mixed together on this. It's an odd fusion, but it works. I'm not much of a Green Day fan these days (personally, I really didn't like '21st Century Breakdown' -- loved 'American Idiot' and I still do, but '21st Century Breakdown' was such a disappointment to me -- but that's another review), but they absolutely smoke here. This is an odd mix of bands, yes, but amazingly, it works.    'Window in the Skies' would not sound the least bit out of place on 2004's 'How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb,' if it had been recorded back then. This is a catchy tune, starting off with The Edge's trademark guitar chimes, and it escalates into a good pop rock anthem. This track is a great tune from U2, I just wish they would have included it on an album instead of this compilation -- it really is deserving of appearing on an album.    Now, the title is what frustrates me. Again, I go back to the box set theory. Wouldn't it make more sense to gather up ALL of U2's singles from 1980 to 2006 (when this compilation was released) instead of just 16 (18, counting the two new tracks which were singles)? Think about it. 'I Will Follow' is missing, 'Stay (Faraway, So Close!)' is missing, 'Staring at the Sun' is missing, 'Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses' is missing, 'Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me' (from the 'Batman Forever' soundtrack) is missing, and 'Even Better Than the Real Thing' is missing. I haven't even *begun* to touch on their other singles. It's ridiculous. Why they released this fresh on the heals of 2002's 'The Best of 1990-2000' is beyond me. It seems pointless.    Are you listening, Interscope Records? U2 is in dire need of a box set ASAP. This band has simply released too much great material AND b-sides to not have a box set. 'U218 Singles' is only recommended for the ***very*** casual fan and the devoted fan, just for the two new tracks. In fact, if it weren't for 'Window in the Skies,' this is easily a one-star disc. This is record company greed at its finest.     So, while I doubt any record executive will read my review, I hope the record companies and U2 get their act together and release a box set. Yeah, yeah the deluxe editions and reissues are nice, but a box set would be, to quote one of their songs, \\"even better than the real thing.\\"     (By the way, the bonus DVD from Milan really is great -- I just wish there was more. It seems more like a sampling than anything. Maybe Interscope will release the complete DVD at a later date, but right now, this is the best we're going to get. Sigh.)    Recommended ONLY for the ****REALLY**** casual fans who have heard 'Beautiful Day' on the radio and want it forthe car or the office and for the fanatical fans like myself for the two new songs, which are admittedly incredible.

Not only does she have some new and different ideas and recipes but she offers ways to make your food beautiful.  How food is presented is as important to satisfaction as the taste. The Japanese have always excelled at this and this nice book will help make your workday or school lunches a joy.

B001UV4XHY|4.0|The cerebral prelude to the now released dash to the finish.  Covers all the most germaine issues that make the suprises in 7.2(if they are)understandable.  For the real vision best to go back to the interminable Book. but this is excellent cinema.

0061474355|2.0|I think the author was going for mysterious but it's just confusing.  Too many unexplained references, too many unanswered questions.  Sabriel herself doesn't know what's going on most of the time.  It's dark and there isn't a lot of character development.  Most of it was pretty boring.  There were a few good parts, and I did finish it, but it was a chore.  And the ending was unsatisfying.  I'm left with a \\"Seriously? That's it?\\" feeling but I don't want to have to read book two so I'm just going to let it go.
1401225756|5.0|It's been a long time since I've read the Sandman stories. Gaiman has certainly come a long way since then--books, movies, The Colbert Report--and he only gets better. Intelligent, humorous, dark, surprising: a joy.
0470449748|3.0|this was the first book i bought to study for the gmat.  like many people, i havent used much of the math since high school (fractions, integers, word problems...).  this book is good if you dont need a refresher and can jump right in.  they dont explain the problems thoroughly (takes for granted you REMEMBER) alot.  so just a warning, dont get this FIRST.  i found the manhattan review guides (set of 8 strategy guides) WORLDS better.  good thing is that they do have MANY sample problems to work. (retired gmat problems)
B005AUWXZ0|3.0|I don't like that my 6 year old son had to ask a number of times, \\"Is that car dead?\\" throughout this movie.  I really bothered him that cars kept dying.  I agree with the reviewers that state this movie is more for the older 8 and up crowd, it was just too much for my little guy to comprehend.
B00518HBD0|1.0|Thank gd for these guys :) That last Coldplay album was a bit too \\"out there\\" and experimemental for me. Did you now the producer made them make every song sound different? LOL. artsy farty. This is just good old fashioned rock the way it was ment to be done, with a good rythm and a good emotion.
0553801473|5.0|I read this book in three days and finished it craving for more. It deals with two plots, in the north and Essos. Both settings are given further depth. We learn more about the history and a darker side of the north, what it means to be a Northman. Some mysteries about the old gods are revealed, more are raised. The growth of some characters is masterfully written with lots of psychological insight. The war is brewing and treachery abound in the North as in Essos. We learn more about various locations in Essos, colorful, rich and exquisitely exotic, a delight to read. Some great new characters, insights, view points, prophesies and political maneuvering in Essos.<br />The problem that most people are having with this book is that there is not enough of plot development. It is true that this is a setup book, two big conflicts are buildup and their resolution will come in future books. But A Dance with Dragons is by no means slow or uneventful. Truly a joy to read.
0553573403|5.0|I was a bit unsure if reading this book was a good idea. I read some previous reviews and didn't expect what I got - that is, a very well written and interesting book.  Mr. Martin knows how to write.<br /><br />Ofcourse, he's no Tolkien, but no wonder. Their styles are totaly different and can't be compared. It's as if I said; Oh, yes this orange is exactly the same as that apple. They can't be compared, but they are both excelent writers.<br /><br />There were some unpleasant comments about all the decent people dying and the evil ones prospering. I don't agree. It was stupidity that killed sir Eddard and Robert Baratheon - stupidity and arrogance. I could discuss the probability of mature men being so naive and straightfoward, but it's mr. Martin who calls the shots. He saves the day (at least for me) when sir Eddard forgot his pride and honour in the end for the sake of his daughters lives. Not that it did him any good, but still, it makes him human (also, he did the right thing as far as I am concerned).<br /><br />There is also the question of honour and honourable. Is it honourable to make it possible for Geoff to become the king or start interminable war by putting lord Stannis on the throne? Is it right to kill the few to save  many thousands from death and suffering and land from destruction? Would it be honourable to stop Hitler from  geting on power at any cost - even by unhonourable means, even by treason or murder? That's another reason why I like this book - it makes me think about so many things.<br /><br />The real hero of this book is a dwarf - ser Tyrion Lannister (at least for me). He's smart, intelligent and witty. He's more honourable and brave than all the rest of the lot put together. He managed to become a decent human being despite of all the cruelty and haterd he was exposed to. That's a true achievement in my book. It's easy to be popular when you are cheerleader, but try to grow and prosper, when your life was made truly hard and sufferable from the very beginning. Henri Tolouse Loutrec comes to my mind, when I read about Tyrion Lannister.<br /><br />At the end I recomend you to read this book. I also recomend you to buy the all the four of them to save some money. When you will start reading, you will never put them down. It's well written, interesting and it makes you think - go for it!Henri Tolouse Loutrec comes to my mind, when I read about Tyrion Lannister.     At the end I recomend you to read this book.

B004TJ1H3C|5.0|When i stumble across the first season of SG-U I really didn't think i would have liked it this much, but when it came to the second season, It was damn AMAZING. Just sad that SyFy don't know what a good show is. And living somewhere where it doesn't come out til october, i just couldn't wait. Thankyou amazon. The package came quickly and in brand new condition, the disc where not damaged and everything was accounted for.<br /><br />Thankyou Matt
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I bought this after getting hooked on the show midway through Season 2. It's probably the best little known show out there. I am addicted and can't wait for the new season so the DVD has helped ease the addiction until September.
0312600844|1.0|I recommended this book based on reviews from New Times and Oprah...that taught me a lesson.  This is the worst book!  6 out 6 in my book group HATED this book.  The characters are shallow and outright mean.  There is not one likable character in the story.  Way too many words are wasted in describing the most horrific behavior - I think, just for the shock factor.  Not every book our group now reads is five star quality, but we often use the phrase, \\"It's not as bad as Freedom...\\"
B000O75F7C|5.0|I am a new fan of PT even though they have been around for a decade. I first purchased the CD since I am a fan of OPETH and PT was mentioned in their DVD concert at Royal Albert Hall from May of 2010 ( also an outstanding DVD!). \\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\" is the best music video I have ever experienced - it is spell-binding, thrilling, and musical art to my ears and eyes. Stephen Wilson is phenomenal and their ethereal music is by turns, soft, gritty, hard, and emotional. I missed their US tour last year but this DVD is actually as good as a live performance because it is so flawless. With surround sound cranked up it is like being there. This band is of genious quality and I recommend it to anyone who is tired of today's cookie-cutter \\"music\\" and longing for somethng meaty, challenging and inspiring.
B00005R62N|5.0|Unleashed in the East is not only one of Judas Priest's best cds of all time, it's one of the best metal cds of all time. Recorded in the late 1970's, it perfectly captures the up and coming sound of what heavy metal would become. Every song rocks hard, most of them played faster then how they were recorded in the studio. The crowd is loud and into it and adds an exciting texture. If you're looking for something that captures Priest's sound from the early days, you've found it!!
B004GYY714|5.0|I'm stationed overseas and far from home... it's so nice to hear radio from my home town. Very easy to use; I found many of my favorite Stateside stations right away and some from Britain and Australia that are new faves. Good job, developers!
B004Y1USV2|3.0|As a fan who has followed YES from 1971 (The Yes Album), I wasn't sure how to approach this album. John Anderson not singing?? Is it really YES??  I know about Drama but that was (I thought) just a spat between Anderson/Squire.  I just slipped this CD into my player - and it's not bad! You can certainly tell Trevor Horn's back in the producer's seat, but it's still different from 90125.   I'm actually quite pleased! Sorry Jon!!  But Anderson fans - don't fret! There is a new album by Jon Anderson/Rick Wakeman coming out as a UK Import. Plus Anderson, Wakeman & Trevor Rabin are going to record a new album!  Anyway - buy this CD. You will be pleasantly suprised!
B00336G7HI|2.0|I bought this battery (NP-FV50) from this page and noticed right away upon arrival that it is NOT up to par to the original NP-FV50 battery that came with my camcorder. The overall shape and physical size of the batteries are identical but this one is NOTICEABLY lighter and made with overall worse craftsmanship. The outer shell does not feel as durable to the touch and when you tap it with a finger, you can hear that there is a lot of empty space inside. This is also confirmed when you lightly shake the battery; you can feel and hear its inner component(s) jiggling. The label on the back of the battery also sports some differences. Together, these differences lead me to suspect that the battery being sold is a counterfeit.<br /><br />As for performance, in my experience (I have used it for about 2 months now), this battery only holds about 65%-70% of the charge that the original one does.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this battery two stars over one is that it does give you some bang for your buck. I bought it for $19.99 + $3.49 S&H (shipped by \\"aes 123corp\\"), which I still think is a pretty good price despite the performance issues. Beware that you are not buying a true original Sony battery though!
B004UXUXKA|5.0|Some 10,000 to 20,000 years ago a rockslide buried the entrance to what is now called the Chauvet cave.  Inside that cave are paintings made over thousands of years--some as long ago as 32,000 years ago.    These paintings are the earliest known human art.    Werner Herzog gained access to this cave over a few days with a small crew using minimal equipment to film this art.      You'd expect early human art to be stick figures or something very primitive.  But as Herzog points out, human art apparently sprang full-blown as these paintings demonstrate.    I was utterly mesmerized by this movie.  I saw it three times in the theater, in 3-D.  If you still have a chance to see it in 3-D, stop reading and leave the house now.      The paintings are beautiful and haunting.  Several nights during the two-week period I was planning my next theater viewing I awoke with the images of the horse paintings in my head (with Patti Smith singing \\"Horses, horses, horses...\\")  I don't want to critique some of the odd things in this movie.  Every human being should see this film.      Herzog has said he wanted to use 3-D for this moview but he would never use it again.  The undulating nature of the walls in the cave--and the way the artists used this--certainly justifies this.      See it.
B00003CXA6|4.0|This is a great movie and Civil War movie.  I ordered it from Netflix and liked it so much that I bought it from Amazon.  There are some memorable actors from generals to foot soldiers.  The dialogue is authentic and the situations historically correct.      There is only one negative performance in the movie, and it is a biggie.  It does detract whenever he is on the screen.  Martin Sheen as Robert E. Lee is one of the most miscast performances I have ever seen in any movie.  He has the whiniest, hokiest Southern accent of any actor I have ever heard.  He is distracting and painful to watch and hear.  I enjoyed him in West Wing but not this role.     Recommended with the reservation that Sheen is a terrible Lee.

B0049P1VHS|5.0|After hearing all of the rave reviews for AMC's 'The Walking Dead', my expectations were rather high. I am pleased to report this DVD collection didn't let me down. It is easily one of the best series I've seen in quite some time. From the 90 minute pilot episode to episode 6's dramatic conclusion, 'The Walking Dead' grabbed my attention in its gnashing, rotting teeth and didn't let me go! The production quality is more like that of a movie; as is the levels of gore, violence and mature content. However, these are not extraneous and only serve to further the plot.<br /><br />As you've probably heard by this point, 'The Walking Dead' is a story where most of the population has become zombies and there are groups of ragtag survivors trying to find some answers and survive as best they can. It has a horror theme, but it is more of a human drama than anything else. The zombies serve as a plot device to test the character of the main players, exposing their strengths as well as their flaws. The casting is spot on and the characters believable and relatable. The second of the two DVDs has a lot of behind-the-scenes / making-of extras and I was surprised to learn that the lead actor who plays police officer Rick Grimes is British. Andrew Lincoln becomes the Georgia law man so thoroughly, you'd never guess. The rest of the ensemble is equally convincing in their varied roles.<br /><br />The Walking Dead is will probably not please all viewers. The level of explicit violence is pretty high, though appropriate considering the subject matter. People stop being nice and do what they have to do to survive when civilization breaks down (I hope I never find out). There are some scenes where the story's continuity breaks down but nothing too detracting. And there is only 6 episodes - I'm left wanting more! Well, season 2 is due to begin in about 3 months and this time we get 13 episodes. I'm tempted to wait for it to come out as a set though. Watching all of a season 1's shows back-to-back was just too engrossing of an experience. Here's hoping producer/writer/director Frank Darabont, the cast and the crew are able to maintain this high level of quality and perhaps even kick it up a notch!<br /><br />~ Kortst too engrossing of an experience.

B0050KEVO6|1.0|This is almost an exact copy of Doodle God which isn't out on Android yet but remains an excellent flash game.  Only difference is the black background and lack of quotes
0553801473|3.0|I have no other explanation for Mr Martin's absurd padding of this narrative than he is paid by the word  In what I thought was the final book (of five so far at 800+ pages each) he starts additional story lines for secondary new characters. But perhaps he needs to introduce new characters since he's kills off the vast majority of major or sympathetic characters by the time you make it to book four. He goes into unnecessary depth for the heraldry of minor characters, and repeats full prayers (instead of just saying they recited the evening prayer or morning prayer)over and over again. Once or twice is enough, I get it the idea.<br /><br />I doubt I'll be willing to plop down another $20 or so five years from now to pick up book six and find out he's still dragging it out.<br /><br />Wrap it up already!
B000002IWH|4.0|If you get one non-score soundtrack, make it this one. I'll admit that I don't like all the songs on here. But the ones I do like make this album worth getting. I've posted the tracklisting below. But I'm only gonna review my favorite tracks without giving much away (if I can contain myself that is lol!!)<br /><br />1. The Cure - Burn (06:39) - The BEST track on this entire album! Heard in the film in one of my favorite scenes when Eric punches the mirror & puts make up on for the first time.<br /><br />2. Machines of Loving Grace - Golgotha Tenement Blues (03:58) - I couldn't get through this entire track. But the beginning is good. Heard in the film when Eric confronts Funboy.<br /><br />3. Stone Temple Pilots - Big Empty (04:55)<br /><br />4. Nine Inch Nails - Dead Souls (04:52) - Another great one! Heard in the film when Eric jumps from rooftop to rooftop to get to Tin Tin.<br /><br />5. Rage Against The Machine - Darkness (03:41) - LOVE RATM!<br /><br />6. Violent Femmes - Color Me Once (04:10)<br /><br />7. Rollins Band - Ghostrider (05:44)<br /><br />8. Helmet - Milktoast (03:59)<br /><br />9. Pantera - The Badge (03:53)<br /><br />10. For Love Not Lisa - Slip Side Melting (05:45)<br /><br />11. My Life With The Trill Kill Cult - After The Flesh (02:58) - This band appeared in the film I think after Eric's second guitar solo where he throws the guitar off the roof.<br /><br />12. The Jesus & Mary Chain - Snakedriver (03:39)<br /><br />13. Medicine - Time Baby III (03:50) - This band appears in the film after Eric says, \\"Victims. Aren't we all?\\" However, the version heard in the film is different than the soundtrack version. The version heard in the film is Time Baby II. Why that isn't here is beyond me cause it should be if you ask me.<br /><br />14. Jane Siberry - It Can't Rain All The Time (05:34) - In the film, Sarah is saved by Eric, who says, \\"It can't rain all the time.\\" and she recognized him as he sang those words in a song. This track is that song. Iam not sure of this version is the same version heard in the film or not.<br /><br />It may not look like I like this cd. But I do! It's just been in my storage for quite some time so I haven't listened to it in what seems like forever. But before putting it away, I put my favorite tracks (tracks 1, 4, 5) on my iPod.
0553801473|1.0|I have been a big fan of this series for some time.  So, i snatched up this book 5 minutes after the bookstore opened on the release date and dove into it.<br /><br />About 1/4 way through I found that I was having trouble keeping going.  The pace was so slow and nothing was happening.  But, I thought, good times are just around the corner...keep going<br /><br />About 1/2 way through, a couple of things happened.  Now I was feeling better...here we go...<br /><br />About 3/4 way through, it had slowed even more than the first half and i was literally falling asleep...<br /><br />At the end, we get some cheesy cliffhangers and no resolution all these plots introduced in this book, not to mention the 300 open plots from the previous books.<br /><br />If you completely skip this book and pick up the next one (When it comes out in 7 years), you won't miss a thing in the overall narrative.  This was a terrible effort.

0307477479|1.0|I just couldn't get into this book.  Out of sheer stubborness I finished it.  I didn't mind the nonlinear approach, it's just that it felt too contrived as did the characters.  I was also annoyed with the branding throughout the book.  It makes it feel dated already.  The 75 pages of text bubbles and graphs felt like filler and did nothing to enhance the plot or characters.  There are so many other good books.  Don't waste your time on this one.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|Plenty of people have done an admirable job of explaining the games in their reviews, so this is instead an attempt at a comparison between a number of games, the pros and cons of each and which may suit different people best. The games in question are: Carcassonne, Settlers of Catan, Castle Panic, Smallworld, and Forbidden Island.     We have had Settlers of Catan and Carcassonne (with a number of expansion packs) for quite a few years now, and only recently added the other games above. We usually either play just as two adults, or with our two older children (age 9 and 8), and so our conclusions are based on how these games work in those settings. So here's what we've found:    Settlers of Catan  We got this around the same time as Carcassonne and initially just didn't latch onto it. Partly it's that it's supposed to be 3 players or more, and we often play as just two of us. Once we found online some instructions for playing as 2 players it came out more often, and as time's gone by it's become fairly 50-50 whether we play Settlers or Carcassonne on a quiet night in. The choice will usually depend on how much we want to think. With Settlers, you're always planning and calculating; with Carcassonne, you're taking it a card at a time.     Who should get it: Settlers is well-known as one of the great modern games. I'm not as sold on it as some people, and it takes quite a while to learn and feel comfortable with, but once you get the hang of it, it is an entertaining and enjoyable addition to a games collection. There are several 2-player rule variations out there if you need them and they work well (we found one that worked for us and we've stuck to it). But this isn't a game for kids; I would suspect not until they're 16 or so. Amongst other things, I think they'll find it too dull.    Carcassonne  This has been a favorite for years now, and everyone we've played it with has gone off to get it themselves. We usually play without farms because it then becomes less directly competitive and more sociable. Kids can play it, adults can play it, it's relaxed, it's fun and it's simple to learn. Here's one nice thing about it: you don't have to be constantly thinking and planning ahead. You don't know what card you're going to draw next time, so you just play one card at a time. You're encouraged to discuss where to put a card, and since you don't know what piece you're getting next, your comments to another player are usually pretty unbiased.    Who should get it: In my experience, pretty much anyone, except those who want ultra-competitive games. The first few expansion packs are also well worth getting, but don't bother with anything from Mayor onward.     Castle Panic  The kids love this one, again it's simple to learn and it has the added bonus of allowing them to get out their aggressive instincts and go postal on monsters! They don't like the `master slayer' option, but prefer just straight cooperative play. After the first few plays, I've found the basic game is too easy, and so we're experimenting with making it more challenging, such as starting with no walls, or drawing 3 monster cards at a time instead of 2. I think Castle Panic will become a game that we get out pretty regularly to play.    Who should get it: People with kids, who want to play cooperative games. Could be fun as a party game too!    Smallworld  While the kids have enjoyed playing this, I think their interest is starting to wane already. I suspect it will work better as a game with a group of adults, or when the kids are older. It has a lot going for it, especially the creative cards and board, but as others have noted - what's with the box for the tokens? Very poorly designed and adds unnecessary annoyance. Most of the time when playing we've found it's not too directly competitive, it's easier to attack lost tribes or declining races, so generally it doesn't get too personal!    Who should get it: I think this would make a fun addition to a games collection, but I don't think it would be a go-to game, especially with kids. The rules are more complicated to learn and explain than the other games, and this makes it hard to just sit down with new players and get on with a game. Having said that, we've enjoyed playing it , and I think it'll get pulled out every now and then over the years.    Forbidden Island  Although the kids would prefer Castle Panic, when we've played Forbidden Island (at my insistence!) they've thoroughly enjoyed it. As the island starts to collapse in a heap toward the end of the game, the tension levels rise and people are on the edge of their seats! The game always ends with voices rising in pitch and tension as cards get turned over - it's fun! It's a pure cooperative game, and that works well for us as a family - no one feels bad, we're all in it together. We're still using the `Normal' level of play, maybe we'll notch up a level soon!    Who should get it: If you like cooperative games, I think this is excellent to have. I love how easy it is to set different difficulty levels, and it's definitely the game that's had the most excited tension - Castle Panic has this at times, but not sustained (at least as the basic game). It doesn't have the whole monster thing going for it that Castle Panic does, and I think that's why the kids haven't latched onto it so quickly (kill trolls or wander round an island getting treasure - which is your average kid going to choose?) but I suspect that long-term it'll have more staying power.
B002FGU46C|2.0|****THE RATING OF THIS PRODUCT IS INFLATED****  --It seems that amazon removed the last Terra Fi 3 product and then imported select reviews to the new Terra Fi 3 listing.  I just noticed when looking back on my original review that it no longer existed and neither was there a link to the product.  Fortunately my review history still had the product so I just cut and pasted the last review I made -- you can verify by looking at my reviews.  Lesson learned -- amazon reviews are not necessarily trust worthy.  ****    REVIEW  I had a pair of Terra Fi 2 sandals for the past 8 years, they were wonderful. When I saw some Terra Fi 3's for sale for ~$35 from sierra trading post I jumped on it even though my TF2's still have some life in them.     What a dissappointment -- don't get me wrong, they were worth every penny of $35, but they are a let down after the great quality of the TF2's.     Pros   The foot bed is an improvement from the TF2       Cons   1. Shock pad is a nuisance, it doesn't add anything, just feels like some extra dense , less giving material under my heel -- thanks but I would rather something softer under my heel.     2. There is less padding layer between the straps and your foot as compared to the TF2 -- this makes the TF3 a bit less comfortable.     Bottom line -- I would reccomend if you can get them on sale, otherwise, I would pass.

B003YL4LYI|3.0|This series is creative, full of interesting characters, and entertaining to read.<br /><br />This book did not have what I expected in it.<br />It was a little like experiencing a soap opera, where little of any consequence happens, and any real resolution or major movement in plot lines is rare. See Richard Raley's review for something more comprehensive. My issues are seeing major characters like Dany and Tyrion just meander through the book. Dany in particular, has a city state crumbling around her and she is pandering to men who are far less capable than her, in order to cobble together a peace that she hopes will please everyone. Didn't really feel like reading about the bold \\"unburnt\\" queen we thought she had become quite a while back. Using the three dragons to any effect seems to be the farthest thing from her mind. Dancing with dragons to me implied the book would have Dany and the dragons doing great, or at least interesting, things. After all, what is the point of having dragons if your not willing to incinerate some infantry or fry an enemy fleet or two with them? Neither Dany or her dragons were involved in a single major battle in the book. Only in the final moments of the book does she begin to think about using them to do the things which I expected to be central to this book.<br /><br />It is a real pleasure to read these books. However, I think Mr. Martin owes his readers more in the way of major developments and/or resolution in each book. In this book, relative to the title, the music started near the end of the book, but the dancing obviously comes later.<br /><br />I would give it 3 stars as a result.
0060936223|5.0|Anyone who is interested in art or in NYC or who grew up in the 60s would enjoy this book. It's wonderfully written so you feel like you're there with her trying to make it as an artist. I highly recommend it.
0553801473|1.0|Thoroughly disappointed in this chapter of ASOFAI, I can't believe it took almost ten years - 10 YEARS - for this bloated, empty, insult of a book, cash making machine production to be written. I didn't find one thing to redeem the whole:<br />- It should be about 1/3 of its pages count if you took out the idiotic text filling (yeah minute description of food, fauna and the likes I'm talking about you!)<br />- The major plots don't just slow down, they CRAWL to a stop<br />- The addition of new characters feels all too convenient,and is not even rendered well<br />- The psyche of some of the most interesting and best characterized major characters is turned basically on its head... Without a reason or semblance of sense.<br />- The one well written part, Tyrion's, actually advances him.... nowhere! not even joking at this point.<br /><br />Basically it feels like this: GRRM is paid by the word, and is literally producing as much as he wants. Imagine a text message where instead of paying by the letter you were the one being paid by the letter by the phone company... How long a message could you write? Well let's see without an end of course. Reading this book was like trying to find gold nuggets here and there in a heap of dung, and trust me the search was not very successful. At this rate and quality level ASOFAI will never be finished, and the way ADWD tu put it bluntly is a slap in the face after books 1-3 I'd prefer if GRRM didn't write another word of it.
B0031RS64G|5.0|I tried to get into this series when I was younger and failed. 7 years later a friend recommended<br />it to me and I reluctantly read Gardens of the Moon, and then promptly raced through the entire series.<br /><br />I can fully understand the mixed reviews this book has been getting and the things that<br />I enjoy about it are probably what put me off it initially. So I'll just give a run through of<br />why I enjoyed it.<br /><br />1.) Never knowing what the hell is going on. So many new characters , nations and new ideas are<br />  introduced, a lot of history is alluded to or told in snatches and only very rarely is anything<br />  ever explained. I've come to prefer this to the author holding my hand or quickly running through the<br />  last N books of the series in the first 20 pages of their new novel.<br /><br />2) Tragedy. Don't get too attached to character X because you'll probably only see them briefly for a few books<br />  if you're lucky or they'll be killed off/maimed any second now. There are a few exceptions and while there is a<br />  theme of tragedy running through these books there are also odd and almost random moments of laugh out loud hilarity.<br /><br />3) Who are the good guys? Are the bad guys really the bad guys? A cast of almost entirely gray characters and the<br />  avoidance of quite a few overdone tropes makes it among the more enjoyable fantasy series I have read.<br /><br />Good read, nice change of pace and subversion of tropes. Not for everyone.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I'm not using hyperbole when I say HBO has done a great thing by backing this production. It's a visual treat with sets and costumes that fit the books well and the music and introduction are also well done. It's a relief that the actors do a great job as well, even the youngest actors give fine performances. I found Cat and Cersei a little grating but that's no different from the books. If I had a complaint it's that it goes a little overboard with nudity but it's an HBO series and I'm sure they were in favor of this. I'm also sure it will be picked up by a cable network and broadcast without the nudity and possibly with less graphic violence at which time my wife will be willing to watch it. For the most part the series follows the first book very closely including the lively dialogue being nearly the same. The most impressive performances are Sean Bean as Eddard Stark and Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister, both capture the characters in the book perfectly. Jack Gleeson's Joffrey is as callow and vicious as in the book and I can't wait to see him suffer his fate in a future season. Sansa is also annoying and vapid and looks a lot like I'd imagined from the book. I'd pictured Arya very differently but Maisie Williams does such an excellent job that now I see her when I read the books which is good. The actors across the Narrow Sea are also amazing, especially Jorah and Dany.<br /><br />*** spoilers ahead *** Dany's vulnerability being replaced by a powerful character is delightful and Iain Glen is perfectly cast and far more enjoyable than Jorah was in the book. Khal Drogo is also perfect and I hated to see him go so soon, much as I hated seeing Eddard's inevitable end - just as I hated these events in the book. George RR Martin is very hard on our favorite characters. Any claims of sexism must come from people who haven't seen or fail to understand the evolution of the female characters. Dany's evolution is one example. Arya and a future character refuse to follow a stereotypical role which is far from sexist. One complaint I do have is that the direwolves haven't become the massive protectors they were in the books. That is probably a practical matter but I wish they'd found a way to use perspective or even CGI to give them the stature of a real direwolf.<br /><br />Forget the criticism, if you ever enjoyed fantasy or historical fiction you should give this show a try.

B003Y5H53S|1.0|I got this delivered from Amazon because generally I like animated movies. I don't have kids and don't have any affiliation with kids so this review is not with kids in mind. Yes there was mildly strong language, get over it.     the visuals were stunning. Details were awesome on the animation. And that's it. The story dragged, the plot was forever being delayed and I fell asleep the first time I watched it. I thought maybe it was because I was tired but the second time wasn't any better. This movie is just bad. I liked some of the action scenes but too much of this was reminicient of Dungeon Crawl. Slogging through the crap to get to the treasure and when we get there it turns out the treasure is an old shoe. Or in this case an old gunslinger. I really wanted to like this movie but it fell flat to me. I suppose some people liked it but I just couldn't stay into it.
B004WCTLNY|4.0|I have to admit I am getting a little fed up with low standards in movies these days. I saw Battle Los Angeles last week and almost gave up on Hollywood all together, what a borefest that was. Well Adjustment Bureau is a little underwhelming as well but what left me with a better feeling about this one as opposed to the last dozen or so movies I have seen is that they don't rely on flashy effects, hip music and cliches to make up for what lacks in the rest of the movie. Adjustment Bureau earned its 3.5 stars on substance alone and although that is nothing to brag about it's more than most movies can say. If you liked movies like The Matrix and Inception chances are you will enjoy this, just don't have too high of expectations for films these days and you will spare yourself some disappointment.
1422161978|5.0|My library has a special section of books I use and refer to often - and The Experience Economy has been there for a decade.  As a brand experience strategist and customer experience designer, I'm delighted to know and have worked with authors Joe Pine and Jim Gilmore.  The updated version of the Harvard Business Review Press bestseller is packed with new and relevant examples of successful business practices, literally on stage.  When I teach and speak The Experience Economy is unfailingly on my list of recommended reading.  Read it for the first time, or re-experience The Experience Economy again in its updated edition and delight in its compelling narrative and insights.
B000E33VWW|4.0|I found Hoffman's (whom I persosnally think is a great actor) portrayal of Capote touching and graphic, and Harper Lee's character was wonderful.  The story, as told from Capote's point of view (or was it Lee's?)is intriguing in it's objectivity, and the love/obsession that developes between Capote and Perry, that over years finishes/destroys Capote's career (and Capote himself) was prev unknown to me; in fact the whole history, except for the book itself, ICB, was new stuff to me.  I guess I'm not terribly informed, but was really surprised to find out later that Capote was the little \\"Prettiest Baby in Town\\" contest winner, from To Kill a Mockingbird, and that the little girl, the narrator and daughter of Atticus Finch of TKAM was in fact Harper Lee.  These facts put the story together in a tangible, tho indescribable way.  The flic makes me think of the 5 blind men describing an elephant, what different points of view we take; like looking at Earth from the moon.<br /><br />I saw referrence to Infamous,and some feel that movie is better; got it on my list now.  I read ICB when I was a kid,  the movie, and now will finish  with Infamous.<br /><br />I recommend Capote to anyone who saw or read In Cold Blood; it might not be historically correct, but it's an entertaining movie.
6304708521|2.0|I have everything that the Beatles ever put out on vinyl and yes, I own a copy of each of their films. That being said. The movie was filmed in Black and white and recolored, its broadcast on the BBC at premier, I believe was also black and white which was a total waste as the color aspect of the film is lost and hence its a snore fest.<br /><br />Everyone is so strung out or post trip that really its a total shambles as far as any perceived plot. The only scene that gave me a laugh was of John shovelling spaghetti on a plate. Otherwise, the music scenes of I am the Walrus and The Fool on the Hill were a total waste even if you had dropped a blotter to relate.<br /><br />I rarely post really really negative reviews, but in all honesty, save your money, this sucks in a supremely quantum fashion. It should be a one star, I gave it 2 because I love their music so much. Sure, everyone had taken acid or done drugs, thats not the issue. This is a rambling directionless film directed and edited in some futile hope that you get it and in reality there nothing to get, everyone basically trips their nads off and you have to see the genius in it. I dont.<br /><br />Even under the guise of Pop culture or pseudo surrealism, this is a big can of suck. I am upset on 2 levels, 1) I cant ever get the time back I wasted in my life watching this and 2)its just so very poorly made.<br /><br />Part of me wishes I could give negative stars. One Caveat, it is still better than Ishtar, and on Ishtar, I will say the only positive thing I could recall was that the movie was shown in an air conditioned room.

0446571415|2.0|I enjoyed most of the other Camel Club books even though one has to dial back one's credibility threshold to accept many of the happenings in the stories. A little poetic license here and there is to be expected. If a reader gets too critical of any novel he/she runs the obvious risk of never liking or being satisfied with anything they read.    If there is one thing that can keep me from enjoying any novel it is a gross error in something that should be common knowledge. This is certainly true if the error occurs in the beginning of the book. My mind kept going back to it every time it was further referenced. This novel turns on a central idea of an explosive thought to be secreted in a basketball. After the explosion small bits of \\"leather\\", supposedly from the exploded basketball, are found leading investigators to find out more about the basketball and how it got to the place of the explosion.    Is there anyone in this country who has not held a basketball at one time or another, most likely in gym class? Anyone who has will certainly remember that basketballs are made of RUBBER, not leather! I realize that the tide of ignorance about common things is inexorably rising in this country. All one has to do is listen to the blow-dry airhead news readers on TV, both national and regional, or read comments posted on the internet in response to articles. They are there for all to see because Joe/Joan six-pack don't have any editors to red-pencil their errors.    It is absolutely astounding to me that this author, with his legions of editors, publishers, friends and others who supposedly read the manuscript failed to pick up on such a basic error! That thought ruined the whole book for me.
1451629184|5.0|Like many others here, I applaud Jaycee for her strength and will.  I too read it in two sittings and in two days, but with a new thought (for me anyway) on the second day.  Many are agast at what Jaycee endured, but I couldn't help but feel there are millions in the world in Jaycee's situation - albeit completely under the rules of their own culture.      I imagine millions of children or young women in Africa, the middle east, India, China... well the entire world actually, who are taken from their family of origin (and some even within that family) much too young and dominated emotionally, mentally, physically and sexually by weak ideologically deluded people such as Phillip and Nancy.      Sometimes I wondered if Nancy too was Stockholmed, but her's was a different story, they married in her late 20's I think. Other stories tell about the relationship between the first wife and the second \\"wife\\" etc. in some traditional cultures - like the movies Raise the Red Lantern or Osama - but for me, those stories have never illustrated the pain and horror of those situations for all involved as did A Stolen Life.    Is this a Human Rights question?  Is it a question of Religous Freedom?  Is it a question of Traditional Family Values in some cultures we are removed from? What do we do when the exact same thing happens to a little girl in say Saudi Arabia, or Calcutta, a basement in Austria or a fundamentalist cult in Idaho... openly and at the hands of an upstanding member of the culture?  Its easy to dismiss Phillip as simply a sociopath and drug addict.    For me the value of this book is the challenge to examine the systems of marital, generational, family and religous domination in our own life and in the world, and seek as JAYC does to end those systems.  This book has left me quite conflicted on the notion of respecting traditional cultural differences when we can no longer deny it can include such forms of systematic domination.         Jaycee Dugard is the voice of all those young women, keeping their will and mind intact, raising their children, hoping someone, somewhere asks just the right question.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|Over the past few years, I've lost a little interest in the Harry Potter series, but I have to see it through 'til the end. This first part was fast-paced and decent, but kinda dragged a little bit toward the end, like it was hurrying to get to the second part. After the death of Dumbledore, Harry, Ron and Hermione drop out of Hogwarts in order to find and destroy the last Horcruxes in order to kill Voldemort. In Dumbledore's last will and testament, Harry receives the Golden Snitch. Ron receives the Deluminator, and Hermione gets a book. Each will help in their journey. Harry also must find the sword of Godric Gryffindor so they can destroy each Horcrux. I would definitely recommend HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS: PART 1!!!
B004FOA84A|1.0|Wish I'd read the reviews before paying $2. Cute game, some of the puzzles WAY too tough, as if to compensate for how disappointingly short the game is. Finished in about 30 min.
B002PMV9FG|4.0|This sequel is better than some others. Voldemort is slowly getting stronger and Dumbledore needs Harry's help to get Horace Slughorn to return to Hogwarts to teach potions. Draco Malfoy is being recruited by Voldemort to become a Death Eater. While attending class, Harry stumbles upon a textbook that belonged to the 'Half-Blood Prince' which is equipped with additional notes and instructions that allow Harry to excel in class. Dumbledore soon shows Harry memories of Tom Riddle when he was younger. He tells Harry about Horcruxes. If they are destroyed, Voldemort will die. I would recommend HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE!!!
B0045TYDNC|3.0|Sometimes newer is not better. Though this one is slightly easier to take on and off with the improved grip, the older LF-1 is a sturdier and more precise fit on my lenses.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|This is the moment we've all waited ten years to see. This movie is very entertaining and doesn't disappoint. I was very satisfied with the outcome. The battle scenes were awesomely epic. This movie is probably the most emotional, because of a few deaths of characters we've gotten to know over the years, and because it's the final chapter. There was a scene in the middle where I shed a few tears. This movie picks up exactly where Part 1 ended. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are still on the hunt for Voldemort's Horcruxes. When they sneak back into Hogwarts, they must try to find the remaining Horcruxes but Hogwarts is soon under attack by Voldemort and his Death Eaters. In the end, only one can live. This has been a great decade journey. I highly recommend HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS PART 2!!!

B0013ND30M|5.0|Box Description: Awaken your senses to the majesty of Sleeping Beauty, Walt Disney's classic fairy tale. See more than you've ever seen before through the magic of state-of-the-art technology, and experience the groundbreaking film restored beyond its original brilliance, in a way Ealt envisioned it - pristine, beautiful, utterly breathtaking. Sleeping Beauty will transform your home into a fantasitc world your family will want to experience again and again.    This 50th Anniversary Platinum Edition release of Sleeping Beauty, as a 2-disc DVD is the first entry in the Platinum Edition line to be released in high definition video. The new restoration features the film in its full negative aspect ratio of 2.55:1, wider than both the prints shown at the film's original limited Technirama engagements in 2.20:1 and the CinemaScope-compatible reduction prints for general release at 2.35:1.    Film Backround: Sleeping Beauty is a 1959 animated film produced by Walt Disney and based on the fairy tale by Charles Perrault. The film spent nearly the entire decade of the 1950s in production: the story work began in 1951, voices were recorded in 1952, animation production took from 1953 until 1958, and the musical score, mostly based on Tchaikovsky's ballet of the same name, was recorded in 1957. Sleeping Beauty's production costs, which totaled $6 million, made it the most expensive Disney film up to that point, and over twice as expensive as each of the preceding three Disney animated features. Sleeping Beauty's successful reissues have made it the second most successful film released in 1959, second to Ben-Hur.

0553801473|2.0|I was so eagerly awaiting this book. I preordered it on Kindle, and I stayed up that night waiting, waiting, waiting for it to be delivered - got it! SQUEE! I get the book, start reading and then, and then, and then....Hmm. At first I just couldn't quite get into it. And then I found myself skipping whole chapters entirely. First I noticed that it was repetitive, with long lists of catchphrases, descriptions of foods, turtles, ships, and names of people only seen once. Then I noticed that I was just bored; I started cleaning my kitchen rather than read (and I hate cleaning my kitchen). The action, such as it was, did nothing to advance the plot; the characters just danced in place, a mummer's show. Finally, it was just kind of gross. Lots of unpleasant scenes of torture and/or sex (torturous sex?). I was just really hoping for better. This series could do with a strong STRONG editor's hand, cutting out swaths of text, tightening up the narrative and the language, and just putting some discretion into the word choices, POV choices, character choices, and scene choices!

0060987464|3.0|The book was ok.. nothing really fantastic.  When I was younger I was a huge Marilyn Manson fan.  I decided to give this book a shot since I've read quite a few other biographies, some sucked and some didn't.  I got the feeling during this book that it's fake?  MM made himself to shock people in his music and his life and if his book didn't deliver than what would we think of him?  If you knew that MM was just a nerd who played D&D and got picked on there isn't much of a story there.. but put in the twist of a grandfather who stored dildos and had porn and lingerie and all these crazy things that went on in MM's head and now you have a story.  I think most of us almost EXPECT his childhood to be how he describes it because anything less would be boring.    If you are looking for a creative story about someone's life that has the sense of being pretty unbelieveable than yes, this book is a read.  If you are reading this because you feel it will give you insight into Marilyn Manson's life in a believeable manner than don't read it.

159420229X|5.0|The title gives you some idea of the quarkiness of the book and the competition that the author Joshua Foer finds himself first interested in and then a champion of. Items such as chicken sexing and a savant that might just be an memory expert are just a few weird items that are covered in this book. If you are looking for exactly how the author sets the US record for card memory, it isn't exactly covered, but the devices used are briefly explained. This is one of the more interesting books I have read and covers a wide range of subjects, but still manages to stay true to the theme of memory and how to expand it. The club of Mental Athletes are somewhat closely related to chess clubs. There is a certain sense of an underground and a fraternity with the Mental Athletes and in their competition. An unusual subject dealt with in a stylistic manner.

0765356147|5.0|This is the first review I have written on Amazon and for good reason - the Mistborn series is a great series but the last book, and the ending, will leave you breathless.    Like many, it would not do justice to the body of work Mr. Sanderson has created here to give too much detail as each reader needs to experience such creativity and thought-provoking storytelling that the author artfully crafted in this series. Suffice it to say, none of it will be wasted time and it may just be the best books ever written.    From my personal view, not only was the series astounding, but never has a work of fiction ever challenged me to consider certain aspects of the real world as a result of a story - at least until now.    My hat is off to you Mr. Sanderson. Your masterfully story touched me in more ways than just enjoying a well-done story, but you have given me pause to consider many things now in life from a different viewpoint and fresh perspective.    For those considering the series, do not wait - you will not be disappointed. Just make sure, to enjoy the full magnitude of the amazing scope of story and masterful world building, that you begin with Book 1 - Mistborn.
B000EHSVS2|5.0|\\"...I believe in the old and sound rule that an ounce of sweat will save a gallon of blood. The harder WE push, the more Germans we will kill. The more Germans we kill, the fewer of our men will be killed.\\"<br />-George S. Patton<br /><br />If one did not know that this quote was said by General George S. Patton on June 5, 1944, it could be taken that it was the from a cold-blooded, patriot with no respect for humanity-or at least the Germans. Fortunately, Patton was that, but he also had much more humanity and intellect in him than the Axis powers.<br /><br />Patton begins the chronicle of the General's exploits after the Battle of the Kasserine Pass. As Patton arrives at headquarters, he assigns Omar Bradley as his deputy, and warns him that there are going to be serious changes around the base. He reduces the breakfast time from two hours to fifteen minutes, and instructs all soldiers to wear helmets. He concludes that the reason they have lost the Battle of Kasserine is due to the lack of discipline, and installing it can give the soldiers the gravity of their situation.<br /><br />From the very onset it becomes clear that Patton respects his solider, but only the soldiers that fight fearlessly and selflessly for their country. He has no respect, and in some occasions condemns, the \\"cowards.\\" To Patton anyone complaining of \\"nerves\\" on the battlefield or with self-inflicted wounds is a coward. These individuals do not deserve to be treated to the Army's medical service, as that should be reserved for the most fearless of soldiers who have given their life for their country with no hesitation. Patton is disgusted at these soldiers who complain about the cruelties of war, and treats them with reproach.<br /><br />As odd as it may sound that a General cannot comprehend his soldiers fears and worries, it must be stated that Patton is not in war due to obligation or simply to serve his country. As General Bradley points out, and Patton assents, he \\"loves\\" war, and WWII is the best incident where his ambition can be tested. Unlike many other Generals his outlook towards war is not an event that must be dominated so the peaceful times can roll, but simply an exciting time in history that he must not miss. WWII for Patton is what Woodstock must have been for hippies, a joyous occasion where talent, ambition, and motivation comes together and euphoria occurs. Simply look at the scene where Patton is guiding the tanks through the muddy banks. That scene exemplifies his love of the battlefield, the joy of commanding, and the passion of leading men in battle. World War II may be a curse and abominable incident for many, yet Patton's views this as a chance that occurs every thousand years. He treats war as if it is a football game, and he may not get another chance to prove himself. His view may be attacked because of his somewhat ludicrous outlook on war, but it must understood that not all men join the army out of a sense of honor or obligation-some actually find the experience quite electrifying.<br /><br />Patton's spirituality is one of the oddest parts of his attributes. When he is complimented that he would have made a great general for Napoleon had he lived in the nineteenth century, he argues that he WAS living at that time. Many of his guests are confused at this response, but guffaw anyway. Patton's belief in reincarnation is a big motif of the film, as well as his mention of important historic facts and events-such as the Battle of Zama. Patton is a history aficionado like no one else, and continually refers to previous battles in regard to the regions his troops will overtake. He recounts how these lands were once taken by the Athenians and other respectful ancient powers. Patton seems to envision that all previous rulers conquered and devoured on the battlefield, and now he will continue in their footstep -but this time in the name of the United States of America. As the Germans point out, Patton is a man of the past stuck in the twentieth Century evidenced by his famous quote: \\"God, I hate this century. God, I hate the twentieth Century.\\" The opposition correctly predicts that Patton will invade Sicily because historians have shown that Sicily is the heart of Italy and Patton's ideology is interwoven with history.<br /><br />Patton's outspokenness usually got him in deep trouble, and often limits his position in the army. His dislike for the Russians and dislike of General Bernard Law Montgomery more than often earns him the scorn of the major politicians from back home. It is at times baffling to consider his courage in comparing the Democrats and Republicans to the Nazi's. Patton may have been controversial, at times exaggerating, but he was not necessarily incorrect in his assessments. Though never appearing in the film, Ike's relationship with Patton is an intriguing one. Even after all the controversies that Patton creates for himself, Ike still supports him; though there eventually came a breaking for Ike when the General's unsavory comments left no leeway of support from Ike or any other public figure. It is of note that Patton who once was superior to Omar Bradley and Dwight Eisenhower, eventually became subordinate to both. Though Ike's swift rise to power was due to conditions unrelated to Patton, it can be stated that Patton's outspoken nature may have had some effect-though this wild speculation-in Omar Bradley outranking him. It cannot be overstated that however respected Bradley and Ike where in the eyes of the German's, it was only General Patton that they feared, and for good reason when we consider the losses that he handed the Germans.<br /><br />Not enough praise can be bestowed upon Screenwriter Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North's screenplay that is as wise and ageless as any other screenplay ever committed to film. Even though they won the Academy Award for best Adapted Screenplay, this screenplay is still understated in its clarity and rich dialogue. We can clearly discern that were wise enough to commit a certain portrait of Patton to film. Patton is so delicately written that besides being a grand portrayal of American's most successful and outspoken military man, it comes to life as an inspirational representation of accomplishing one's dreams. Patton loves the battlefield because he deems that fighting is the sole reason to live, and his dislike of cowards must be understood from this angle. He does not treat war as unfortunate due to the fact that he has trained all his life for war, for fighting, and conquering. This film with its grand screenplay, cinematography, and direction still is most renowned and praised due to George C. Scott's portrayal of the general. Anyone who has seen  Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb will be taken aback at Scott's controlled yet astonishing portrayal. Often stated as one of the best male performances captured on film, Scott not only gets the Patton's demeanor right, but he completes the harder task of translating the stressful situations that Patton experiences in an illuminating way. Patton does not attempt to show the situations of war, for that has been done countless time, but rather suffices in honoring the men, every one of them, through one figure.ed by his famous quote: \\"God, I hate this century.

B0054NQZ9S|5.0|I watched this movie and came away from it with real mixed emotions.  To start with, the movie itself I thought was great.  It is a definite must-see movie.  The cast was excellent--Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee-Jones, Ben Affleck, etc. You can't get much better than that--kind of made me wonder what the cost of making this movie was.  But more than that, it deals with an issue that is so germane to our lives and important. Something that each and every one of us thinks about if not in the front of our minds then definitely in the back of our minds---what were to happen if we were to get laid off.  I thought the movie dealt with it in both a very realistic and sensitive manner. It showed the reality of people who couldn't pay their bills and others who were less immune to that reality? It showed the need to always be thinking about how importnat it is to save for a rainy day and to manage your expenses wisely.  And it also showed the ties that bind family during difficult times.  Overall I give this movie 5 stars and highly recommend it.
0002247402|4.0|The death of Tyrion as my favorite character, anyway.  Four-stars because, well, I did like it.  I was massively disappointed, but an inferior SOIF book is like an inferior pizza--I'll eat it, and I'll like it, but I'll remember better ones.<br /><br />The handful of early reviews did nothing to help my expectations:<br /><br />\\"[The fantasy elements don't] make Mr. Martin the American Tolkien, as some would have it. He's much better than that.\\" - Dana Jennings, NYTimes<br /><br />\\"After five volumes Martin is, if anything, a better writer than when he started.\\" - Lev Grossman, Time (the reviewer who first called GRRM the 'American Tolkien' that Jennings is one-upping)<br /><br />\\"A Dance With Dragons, the longest of the installments of A Song of Ice and Fire to date, might also be Martin's finest work yet, a taut and relentless masterpiece.\\" - Jace Lacob, The Daily Beast.  No, it only FELT like the longest.  Storm of Swords was the longest, but it felt as short as one of R.L. Stine's Goosebumps books.<br /><br />\\"So very much worth the wait\\" - Every Book Critic Who Read It Before Me<br /><br />'Giddy with excitement' would be the best way to describe holding this big, beautiful, b----rd of a book for the first time.  The stellar prologue, the glowing reviews--my high expectations seemed justified on release day.<br /><br />But unlike the nearly perfect first three books (even the relatively boring Bran chapters allowed me to put the books down and get some shut-eye; God bless that kid), this installment has a heartbreaking number of cons.  I'll start with those.<br /><br />This review is going to be pretty spoiler-y, by the way.<br /><br />First and foremost, Tyrion sort of sucks now.  I used to high-five myself whenever I approached a Tyrion chapter--now he's the new Brienne.  Like Brienne, there were a handful of exciting or revelatory moments, but the excitement-to-page number ratio was abysmal.  Could it have helped if he met up with Dany like we all thought hewould?  Sure.  But I'll give Martin the benefit of the doubt that he has other things in mind for the moment, and those two hooking up this early would mess up his plans.  But if that's the case, then Tyrion murdered not only his father, but also his narrative arc for the next two books.<br /><br />I say that because these characters fascinate by possessing some combination of interesting qualities--power, wealth, glamour, and magical might.  Tyrion's patricide and exile essentially made him a commoner, with no fascinating qualities other than his \\"wit\\", which is really just Martin's wit.  It's not good enough.  He was also that rare character with a conscience that could be shrewd, yet not enslaved to a morality that binds his hands (one of Martin's favorite cynicisms).  Unfortunately, he's grown nihilistic, more cynical, and even downright mean.  Such darkness has long been a criticism of this series as a whole, but Tyrion was such a reliable little torch, and now that he's not, those complaints appear more valid.  Oh, and I don't have the quote handy, but Tyrion states a preference for priests who \\"diddle little boys\\" over those \\"troublemakers\\" who are sincere in the practice of their religion.  Ugh, and Yawn.  Childish, undergrad sentiment.  That had the effect of ripping me right out of Westeros and into a discussion of those awful, awful Catholics that Martin is no doubt referring to.  When I visit Westeros, spare me the overt allusions to contemporary social politics, please.  Too bad all five books couldn't have been written in the Clinton years--it's as if eight years of Bush embittered Martin and some of it stained the page like a spilled coffee.<br /><br />Secondly, the Daenerys storyline is mostly disappointing and stagnant.  Ten years ago when I read that she would \\"stay\\" in Meereen and rule, I didn't know that meant she was going to be there for 15+ years of MY life, screw up an entire continent, and leave Westeros to flounder under the rule of the Lannisters for the foreseeable future.  I still don't get the point of this \\"Let's Practice on These Eastern Weirdos\\" model of monarchy.  Why is it OK to screw up the city of Meereen as \\"practice\\" for ruling in Westeros?  Ethics aside, how does it even make sense?  At least in Westeros you might be able to assemble a decent small council--I'm sure Barristan Selmy has a good idea of who might be suitable to help rule sensibly.  Go play with your own toys, Dany, and who knows, maybe they're made of sturdier stuff.<br /><br />This raises questions about the motives of Varys and Illyrio Mopatis.  Why was such care taken to groom Aegon in the ways of Westerosi statesmanship, who appeared to have a small army of qualified educators and tutors, while Viserys and Daenerys had the relative equivalent of an eighth-grade education?  Why was Jon Connington so interested in the well-being of Rhaegar's son, but not his little brother and sister?  I understand that you might want to keep them separated for the same reasons that Osha and the Reeds separated Bran and Rickon, but a little inner monologue from Connington on the subject of Dany and Viserys would have gone a long way.<br /><br />The Barristan Selmy chapters were OK, but he's in Meereen, and I'm ready to leave Meereen behind in this series, right now.<br /><br />Victarion Greyjoy's an irredeemable bore, and Quentyn Martell's POV is another unfortunate detour away from Westeros.  Two more drifters in the half of the world I'm not particularly interested in.<br /><br />The single Jaime chapter tied up a major loose end in the War of the Five Kings and revealed something we all already knew, but I'd have preferred he be skipped altogether if that's all there's going to be.<br /><br />31 of the 73 chapters of the book between the aforementioned characters made for some plodding, but I still finished the book in a week, and two of those days were spent lugging the 2.5-lb book over 21 miles of Appalachian Trail, so you know it wasn't ALL that bad.  As to what I liked...<br /><br />Pretty much all of the events at Moat Cailin and northward.  Theon chapters are better than ever, and his downfall and slow, oh so slow, crawl toward possible redemption was brutal and thrilling.  Through his POV, a monster worse than Gregor Clegane is featured heavily, and the narrative is mesmerizing here.  Now that Theon's loose, I can't wait until word gets out that Bran and Rickon are alive.<br /><br />The Jon chapters didn't advance the plot as much as I expected, but they were anything but boring and I can tell that Martin moved all the pieces around for some serious and early action in the Winds of Winter.  And his last chapter was the emotional equivalent of the biggest roller coaster ever built.<br /><br />Davos is solid, and it's through his POV that we see the most satisfying comeuppance in the series to date.  Point taken, Martin...don't underestimated the fat jolly types or they might serve you a Cousin Pie.<br /><br />Asha Greyjoy improves from AFfC.  All three of her chapters were good, even the one where \\"nothing\\" happens, unless you count the slow despair of an army succumbing to the elements as \\"something\\", which I do.<br /><br />And Bran!  Oh, Bran!  He's arrived at his destination, and it's completely fascinating and other-worldly.  I never thought I'd say it, but give me more Bran!<br /><br />The single Areo Hotah chapter kept us in touch with the Dornish, and it was a good chapter.<br /><br />The Cersei chapters were also very good, although like her twin, I expected events to unfold faster than they did.  I was under the impression that 400 pages of story were to happen starting when the chronology of Feast for Crows ended.  She was my favorite part of that book, so I'm definitely looking forward to what happens next.<br /><br />As mentioned, little Aegon Targaryen's been alive the whole time.  Why not.  He seems like a little a**-kicker, and his story moved quickly.<br /><br />The dragons.  They're not dangerous pets anymore.  They're terrifying monsters.  Martin did such a good job with them that I'm ready to forgive the rest.  Think about the complications that might arise trying to raise male tigers in your backyard.  And they can fly and breathe fire.  It's like a little horror story tucked within the larger fantasy structure.  Awesome.<br /><br />And finally, the epilogue.  I couldn't take a whole book without a small council meeting.  I guess Martin knew it.
0545123275|4.0|I have read Shiver by Maggie Stiefvater three times now and I loved it every time! I read it for the first time right when it came out. Then I re-read it when Linger, the second book in The Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy, was released. And just the other day I read Shiver for the third time, in anticipation of Forever, the final book in The Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy. So I guess you can go ahead and say that I liked it. A LOT!     Shiver is a remarkable love story about Grace & Sam and told from their alternating perspectives. Grace (human year round) is obsessed with the wolves that live behind her house, the wolf with the yellow eyes in particular. She has been ever since they dragged her from her swing set when she was only a child. Sam (human only certain months of the year) is fascinated by Grace. He watches her when he is a wolf and when he is human he wants to talk to her, but he has never had the courage until now! (Put 'em together and what have you got bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!) It's an extremely sweet and romantic tale.    I gave Shiver by Maggie Stiefvater 4 STARS. It's an original, spectacular story with splendid characters, and I think it started The Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy off on the best note possible! I recommend this book and look forward to reporting on the next two books in the trilogy Linger & Forever.     -XOXO  READING, EATING & DREAMING    TO READ MORE OF MY YOUNG ADULT REVIEWS CHECK OUT MY BLOG AT BLOGSPOT: readingeatinganddreaming.blogspot.com
B004WKOCP8|1.0|So many great albums in the Incubus vault...then here comes If Not Now, When? in 2011. I truly get bored to tears listening to the new release...and after 7-8 listens I can say that I gave it a chance and will not regret deleting every song from my iPod.  I'm OK with the fact that Incubus decided to make an album like this...it's just that I believe they failed to make good songs.   Hope the next album is worth purchasing but my hopes will not be very high.
0545259088|3.0|Do you know how DVD's sometimes come with special feature options which allow you to watch an alternate ending or the director's cut? I really wish this book came with a button like that, one that said CLICK HERE FOR DETAILED AND EXTENDED CONCLUSION! (Yeah well unfortunately it doesn't.)    Forever, the final book in the Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy, by Maggie Stiefvater was good. However, my expectations for Forever were set much higher than good. This novel just isn't up to par with its two predecessors: Shiver and Linger. It's still a good story...it's just not AMAZING (which to be honest is what I was expecting).    This novel started off amazing. I really enjoyed the prologue because it built a ton of anticipation. The middle of Forever was even really good. The only big negative for me was that there wasn't enough interaction between Sam & Grace and Isabel & Cole. However, it was still very interesting. Then, finally, I got to the end of Forever which, of course, is what I have dying for and ugh...it was rushed and disappointing. I have been waiting FOREVER to see how everything comes together for these characters. Will so-and-so stay a wolf? Will (insert name here) find a cure? Will they be able to spend forever together? Etc. And now that I am finished with this trilogy I still want answers. There are parts of this novel that should have reduced or cut out and then there are parts (like the ending) that should have been elaborated on.    However, Forever still makes for a good read and it didn't ruin the entire series. I still enjoyed Grace, Sam, Isabel & Cole a lot. And I am glad I got to at least somewhat see what the future holds for them (it's not as much as I wanted but it's more than I had before).    I gave Forever 3 STARS because although it was enjoyable it wasn't on the same level as Shiver or Linger. The Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy is now complete. Overall it is a pretty darn good series and I think young adult readers should check it out!    -XOXO    READING, EATING & DREAMING      TO READ MORE YA REVIEWS CHECK OUT MY BLOG ON BLOGSPOT: READING, EATING & DREAMING I WAS BLAIR WALDORF
0062060554|5.0|A well crafted book from a newcomer.  The pace was hypnotic and the twists and turns were well paced.  I thought I had it figured out near the end, but was nevertheless surprised.  This would make a really good film.
0545123291|4.0|Maggie Stiefvater does it again! Linger is a spectacular addition to The Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy.<br /><br />Recently I re-read Linger, the second book in The Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy, by Maggie Stiefvater. WOW, now I am DYING to read Forever, the final book in this trilogy. Let's just say Maggie Stiefvater knows how to build anticipation and keep us wanting more!!<br /><br />Linger is told from the alternating perspectives of Grace, Sam, Isabel & Cole (a new character).<br /><br />I love Grace & Sam, in Shiver and in Linger. I am rooting for them all the way. Seriously, Sam writes music, plays guitar, sings his songs, and reads poetry!!! Grace is his muse. The only reason I wouldn't root for them is because I want him to myself<br /><br />I really LOVE the addition of Isabel & Cole's perspectives. And even though Grace and Sam are the stars of the show, Isabel and Cole stole the show (or at least my attention). I wanted more and more scenes of them. Isabel and Cole are darker characters. They are both struggling with their own guilt, fears and depressions. However, their banter and no-nonsense attitudes are entertaining and refreshing. (Did I mention Cole is a musician too!! Not fair!)<br /><br />I gave Linger by Maggie Stiefvater 4 STARS. I strongly recommend this book and look forward to reviewing the third and final book in this series, Forever.<br /><br />-XOXO<br /><br />READING, EATING & DREAMING<br /><br />TO READ MORE YA REVIEWS CHECK OUT MY BLOG ON BLOGSPOT: READING, EATING & DREAMING I WAS BLAIR WALDORF
B00007KWHG|5.0|I have owned the non-re-mastered version of this CD for 23 years (yes, 1988).  I treasure it still, but have been debating on whether or not to grab the re-mastered version of this collection.<br /><br />After reading all of the praise heaped on this CD (particularly the re-mastering job performed), maybe I will after all.<br /><br />Why miss out on a GOOD THING?<br /><br />I rate The Very Best of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons...5 stars!<br /><br />Thanks, fellow Amazoners for the feedback!
B000001Y5D|5.0|Well, it figures I would have to go all the way back to the early nineties to find that authentic 'alternative' rock sound. When contemporary alt rock supposedly includes the likes of Fall Out Boy and Linkin Park, I'd say it's time to worry. Nothing can derail the classics and I would certainly consider this a fantastic effort despite 4 Non Blondes being constantly referred to as a 'one-hit wonder group'. For the newbies, 4 Non Blondes' sound is akin to the RHCP (especially those guitar riffs), Heart, Pearl Jam, and Jefferson Airplane. Vocally, Perry reminds me of Janis Joplin: soaring powerful vocals full of relentless grit that complement their bluesy psychedelic style perfectly.<br /><br />Stand out tracks include the one and only \\"What's Goin' On?\\", \\"Train\\" (similar to Heart's 'Barracuda), \\"Pleasantly Blue\\" (Blues influence shines here, of course), and \\"Dear, Mr. President\\" (sociopolitical protest song; very powerful message and equally powerful musicianship).<br /><br />Additionally, I like variety (violins, acoustic/electric guitars, drums, harmonica; it's all here) and while this band had a focused niche, it's unclear why this album remained their solitary release. They only had one in them I suppose. Regardless, \\"Bigger, Better, Faster, More\\" has enough panache to satiate both die-hard nostalgic alternative rock fans and curious teens rifling through their parents CD collection. Highly recommended. If you don't own this gem already, get it!
B004XJHBCE|5.0|I rarely review apps but I have to say hats off to the developers here. This app is everything I have been trying to do with countless widgets, folders, and the like. Very easy to use once you play with it for a few minutes and TOTALLY customizable. I wish I could give 6 stars. Well worth the purchase!
B002RSDW8A|5.0|I remember being a kid and watching reruns of Julia Child's TV series with my grandmother. She, of course, had her book and would often cook from it. She used it constantly. I have some great memories of her in the kitchen and I always attached those memories to Julia Child.<br /><br />I do wish I still had my grandmother's copy of Mastering the Art of French Cooking but, alas, it seems to have gotten lost over the years. I've recently purchased the books, vol. 1 and 2 as well as Julia's DVD collection so I get to watch her show all over again. It's all very nostalgic for me and it was a big part of growing up...realizing my love of food and the culinary arts and having Julia's teachings to help me. She definitely was the master. No one can touch her.<br /><br />I was VERY excited when I'd heard they were making this movie based on her life. I'd somehow missed the book coming out but I grabbed it right away. I have to say that this may be my favorite movie. I saw it in theatres and since it came out on DVD, I've watched it around 30 to 40 times. I admit that I may be slightly obsessed.<br /><br />It's the type of feel good movie that you can watch over and over if you need a pick me up. It's inspiring, it's amusing, it's interesting and it has some of the MOST lovable characters ever. I genuinely wanted to know these people. At times it feels like we're spying into their lives...overhearing a conversation or laughing at an inside joke. It's a story (well, 2 stories) that anyone can relate to. Two people, bored with their lives, take on challenges in a quest to better themselves and make their mark in the world. To be known and to have a purpose...and one of them becomes one of the greatest chefs of all time who wrote one of the most important and essential books in the culinary world. And it started simply because she had nothing better to do. It's inspiring because it shows you that you CAN set goals for yourself and really accomplish them.<br /><br />It depicts Julia and Paul Child as very sweet, caring, upbeat characters with amazing senses of humor and a real lust for life. And I have no doubt that they really were just that. The love they had for each other is also definitely to be envied. We also get a peak into various other parts of their lives. Paul's government work as well as Julia's struggle to learn French, get her book published and to be accepted in what was very much a male dominated field at the time. Julie...was the opposite of Julia in a lot of ways. She was very negative. She was pessimistic and whiny, she was self involved and seemed to live in her own little world. However! She was still fun to watch and she provided a nice balance to the film...we get to watch her realize her mistakes, grow from them and learn to appreciate her husband and her life more than she did at the beginning. I realize the character of Julie in the film, from what I hear, is quite a bit different from the real Julie but...that's a different review.<br /><br />The acting is superb! From everyone. Everyone in the movie had such amazing chemistry together. It was perfect casting. Amy Adams is fantastic at portraying Julie, Stanley Tucci was the perfect choice for Paul Child, Chris Messina was great as Julie's sweet, loving and always supportive and helpful husband Eric. Jane Lynch gave such an amusing, fun performance as Julia's sister Dorothy. I believe the time she and Meryl were on screen together was my favorite part of the movie, they had excellent chemistry. Also Linda Emond brought such a charm and likable spunkiness to Simone Beck. Last but not least...Meryl Streep deserved the Oscar for Julia. I believe she was robbed. Her mannerisms, her voice, her sense of humor and her overall lovable personality...she became Julia Child. One of the best performances by acting's best actress. You don't get any better than Meryl Streep.<br /><br />The sets and the scenery are just beautiful. They did an amazing job filming the movie and capturing what her life was like in Paris. The film has a very whimsical feel to it...the charming decor, the bright bold colors of the food...the food, of course, makes the movie and there is a TON of it! I dare anyone to watch this and NOT be hungry after.<br /><br />I couldn't imagine giving it anything but 5 stars because it deserves nothing less. It's a fantastic movie based on the life of a fantastic and memorable woman who's culinary teachings and food are treasured by so many people from so many places. A true inspiration she was...and I truly adore this movie.film has a very whimsical feel to it...the charming decor, the bright bold colors of the food...the food, of course, makes the movie and there is a TON of it!

1400052181|5.0|I just finished the last pages, and have been left in awe of the decade of interviews and research that went into this book's creation.<br /><br />Henrietta Lacks died of cervical cancer in 1951, but left behind an immortal legacy: the first cells that survived and continuously reproduced in the laboratory. These surviving cells - called HeLa - were shared by the doctor who discovered them with labs all over the world, enabling innovations such as the polio vaccine, in vitro fertilization, and genetic research. Many scientists in the book are quoted as believing that HeLa cells were one of the most medical discoveries of all time.<br /><br />But behind the story of the cells is the story of Henrietta Lacks, kind and vivacious young woman, daughter of sharecroppers, granddaughter of slaves, who died an agonizing death from cervical cancer. The children she left behind suffer poverty and the misery of a criminally-abusive stepmother. Later, those children suffer more as they are told the nearly incomprehensible news that their mother's cells are still alive, with billions of them having been reproduced and used in experiments: they have been cloned, blasted with radiation, subjected to chemotherapy, exploded in an atomic bomb blast, and even launched into space.<br /><br />The author, Rebecca Skloot, spent ten years researching this story and developing a close relationship with the Lacks family, especially Henrietta's daughter Deborah. Skloot carefully and lovingly presents each character with accuracy and humanity: we hear their accents, witness their mood swings, and experience moments of violence and of transcendent grace.<br /><br />I will never forget this difficult book. I left it with questions about scientific research, wondering who should own the rights to the tissues and cells of my own body. But most of all, I left with gratitude for this author and Henrietta Lacks, and admiration for Henrietta's indomitable daughter, Deborah, who struggled so hard and long to comprehend and honor the story of the mother she never knew.he story of the mother she never knew.
1936719010|5.0|Read it, re-read it and take notes, highlight it.  I'm not loaning this one out but will highly recommend it to others.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Well done fun game. Runs well and has great graphics. Another one of those games perfect for the smart phone.
B002QGUFWE|4.0|Sorry I'm a bit late for this review. I hope Lady Gaga can forgive me for being so direct and so frank. The Fame Monster is absolutely stupendous! It blew me away totally.<br /><br />Gaga seems to be chaneling a lot of other great artsites here. Ace Of Base in Alejandro, Depeche Mode in Monster, Paula Abdul in Telephone, Queen in Speechless, Madonna in Dance In The Dark and I can picture Annie Lennox doing a really mean version of Teeth.<br /><br />In my country only the deluxe edition is available minus the explicit mutterings. \\"I'm a free bic (Bitch) baby!\\" It came with The Fame again. My version had Disco Heaven and Rerto Dance Freak on top of the standard album tracks.
B004LUS390|5.0|Worth every cent. Sketchbook is the standard for digital drawing and .99 cents is nothing for all the features offered. Updated often and I've never had any issues. A must get for anyone interested in art.
B001DEVZUG|4.0|Disc one includes most of Annie's well known stuff. The two new trcaks Pattern Of My Life and Shining Light are truly great stuff.    But what really got me going was the second disc of rarities and live tracks. You have to listen to believe it. Many Rivers To Cross, her duet with Alicia Keys on REM's Everybody Hurts and Into The West - sublime stuff not on the standard edition. Missing are the Lennox/ Al Green number Put A Little Love In Your Heart.    The accompanying DVD finally put in Little Bird - previously missing from the Diva DVD. On the plus side, the new videos for Pattern Of My Life and Shining Light are here. You also get Something So Right and Waiting In Vain. The latter featuring a quirky Lennox dressed as Minnie Mouse doing housework. Love Song For A Vampire is not in (groan). Probably due to movie rights issues.    The paper packaging was a little tattered and worn. It's the same for all copies I've come across. However, if you can overlook the physical imperfections and minor omissions, this is a great buy for fervent Lennox devotees.
B00518HBD0|4.0|I am so happy 3 doors down finally released a new album. I was disappointed with their last one so i am very pleased with how this one turned out. I've been a fan of this band for 13 years or so and i never miss a tour. They are consistent and just an all around good group of guys. I will always support southern rock! Stand out songs for me would be....  1. Time of my life  2. Round and Round  3. Back to me  4. Every time you go  5. What's left  6. Believer  7. Silence remains (bonus)    I voted this album 4.5 stars. Only because i believe \\"Away From the Sun\\" is still their best and this one is just below that. Which isn't a bad thing.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|Probably the best program of its kind. Well worth the money I paid. Extremely customizable and very easy to use. If you have a lot of applications this makes them easy to find. Also has great widgets and shortcuts. Definitely worth a try!

B001UW58WW|2.0|My first review of any music.  Garrett gave the first full blown disaster of his life with Rock Symphonies.  It was a shock.
1451629184|5.0|Stunningly brilliant survival skills.  So many reviewers ask why she didn't run.  I think that is quite possibly the reason we have a survivor here (they are all killed aren't they?).  Don't think he wouldn't have killed her.  She was so diligent about her survival that she never gave her captor a reason to get rid of her.  Whether this was a natural ability or continually planned, she was entirely tuned into him every day of her captivity and knew that her survival depended entirely on her relationship with him.  She states this over and over in the book.  (I knew I shouldn't say this, I knew I had to smile, I knew I couldn't complain).  Does any of us think it would be possible to maintain that kind of diligence?   I think most people would have let him know some secret they were keeping somehow (hatred, disgust), even within the first couple of weeks.  Don't be misled into thinking she is weak.  Different superpowers for different situations.  She won the jackpot.  She was abducted by the kind of person who kills their prey 100% of the time and she survived.  Jaycee, you kicked ass!  You won!  It took an incredible 18-year battle, but you won, you are free, and he is toast.  Congratulations you beautiful, amazing woman!  Do whatever the f*** you want for the (still long) rest of your beautiful life.
0553801473|3.0|I started reading this series about a year ago. I was enraptured by the first three books (especially A Storm of Swords), and I came off a bit disappointed by A Feast for Crows, not just because it had a slow pace, but because my favorite characters were left out.<br /><br />But this only got me more excited for A Dance with Dragons. I thought it could be like the movie Twins, where GRRM would put all of the recessive genes into Feast while putting the dominant genes into Dance. The book started off well, with some interesting revelations taking place early on, but it quickly returned to the pace of A Feast for Crows.<br /><br />Something that disappointed me was how few Bran chapters were included. I felt he had the most interesting chapters in the entire book (and not to spoil anything, but it actually gets somewhere.) Even if the rest of the book were just segments of Bran training that didn't go anywhere, the skinchanging segments are some of the most fascinating passages ever written that it would still be satisfying.<br /><br />But no, instead of Bran, we get nameless character after nameless character that doesn't do anything. Only a few of these characters I felt were absolutely necessary, and the ones that were had enough chapters to warrant getting an actual name, instead of being giving 4 or 5 names throughout the book.<br /><br />The book came off as 1000 pages of build-up to The Winds of Winter, with events happening at the end of the book that get you really excited for what's to come, only to be cut short. I honestly can't wait for TWoW, but not because I was so enthralled by this book; it's because this book plodded along, introduced some exciting things, but cut us short.<br /><br />To me, George R. R. Martin has become like another George, the one named Lucas. Both creating some of the best pieces of fiction ever. George Lucas obviously created Star Wars, and GRRM created A Song of Ice and Fire. When Lucas introduced some questionable ideas with the prequels, who at that point would dare question the man who made Star Wars? It's the same with GRRM now. His series is commonly referred to as one of the greatest fantasy series of all time. What editor would have the guts to tell him that his novel was sloppy, meandering, and pointless up till the last few chapters, especially when under a tight deadline. The editor could force him to refine the novel, but push back the ridiculously close July 12th deadline, or the editor could put a first draft into print and make a bunch of money.<br /><br />So, in conclusion, A Dance with Dragons was disappointing. But hopefully, GRRM has purged himself of all the tedious build-up and will deliver us an action-packed, eventful Winds of Winter. Of course, I thought A Feast of Crows was going to be a purge, too. Well, I guess I'll have to wait and see, and there will be a lot of waiting.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|This app took just a few mins to figure out. I had every screen full of app icons on my phone, but now using this I was able to organize all my app on one page. I got this for free here on amazon, but after using it, I would have happy paid the $1.50 for it. Well worth it.
1451629184|5.0|This is a harsh book to read. She leaves nothing to the imagination with her ordeal with these evil people! It is powerful to read, and she is someone who endured what most cant even imagine and has come out for the most part as a functioning daughter and mother to children she had under deplorable conditions. Not for the weak of heart, very graphic, and very very sad how the entire system let this woman down when she needed them most!! A book that shows Americas justice system flaws and they way sex offenders are let to just be out there on their own while pot users are locked away for 20 to 50yrs knowing that the sex offender is never cured! The best book I have read in a long long time.

B000MV90IU|4.0|For years, I've heard about how this was one the best car movies ever, with the Mustang-Charger chase, so I finally picked it up. I wish I would've rented it. Don't get my wrong, I still enjoyed it, but at the end I was left thinking \\"that....that was it? All this hype for that?\\" I took into account the age and what they had to work with, but just wasn't what I had pictured in my head.     For the movie itself, there was a lot of just standing and walking around to the point I was shouting \\"Just DO something!\\" The hospital chase was pretty good though.     The sound and picture were good, considering the age of the movie. No surround, but it didn't need it .    Will I watch it again? Eh, hard to say. Not in the foreseeable future. If someone asks me \\"Hey have you seen Bullitt? I heard it was really good\\", I might have them come over and watch it.

0553801473|2.0|My thoughts are the same as those of many other folks who have already posted here: instead of being a worthy sequel to the fantastic story of the first three books (we shall pass over the fourth in discreet silence), DANCE boasts too much needless description (of food, of clothing, of bloody TURTLES), far too many pointless POV characters, and not nearly enough PLOT.<br /><br />Stranger and Maiden and Crone, whatever happened to the plot?  I would mind the lack of action less if there had been some meaty character development to hold my interest along the way, but alas! There was little of that to be had. A character finally getting her head on straight after hundreds of pages of worrying about her clothes and love life does not count as significant personal growth.<br /><br />A great disappointment, this, especially after the six year wait.
0553801473|3.0|I just got the book from the library and it is a doorstopper; however I noticed that all the prepress and editorial reviews were all glowing while the true readers from Amazon less than glowing. I give the Amazon reviewers more credence and I'll post after I've finished reading, if I can finish! I give it 3 stars for the cover art improvement.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|This app makes organization so much easier.  I've organized over 200 apps in less than a half hour, while watching TV and nursing a baby.  My phone does have a folder feature that I use to use but this is so much faster and easier.  My husband was rambling on about several other features he likes about it so I'm pretty sure I'm not even using it to its full capacity and I like it.  (he's been using the free version for months)  Good app!
B004XJHBCE|5.0|This is the only app that I have ssen that truly lets me hide those damn apps that VZW has pre-loaded on my phone. Unfortunately, I am not going to root my phone, but I HATE looking at stupid apps like Tune Wiki, Rock Band, and City ID. Now I don't have to see them. Also, if you purchase App Launcher Pro, you can also set up a scrollable widget which is absolutely remarkable. App Launcher Pro aside- this is the best app that you can have on your phone. You would be foolish not to purchase it. Take control of your phone- buy this app!

0553801473|3.0|There are some great story bits in this way overdue book, but again Martin wastes endless pages with descriptions of food, recycled catch-phrases and meaningless conversation. The actual plot relevant part are fantastic, the dross in between is frustrating. Is it worth reading? Yes. Should someone beat Martin with an editing stick. Please gods yes! After such a long wait I expected more and better.
0553801473|3.0|As a huge fan of the first three books, I was (like most fans) mostly disappointed with the fourth, and bought into the press about how all the \\"good stuff\\" would be in this one. It was great to be back with our old friends Jon, Dany, Tyrion, and all the rest, and eagerly read trough page after page, only to find myself frustrated with the lack of... well, anything. Dance has no resolution to any of myteries that abound in the realms, instead giving us endless pages of sailing, marching, more sailing, and more marching. Everyone traveling and no one ever getting anywhere. All our favorite characters are bogged down in their various pursuits seemingly forgetting completely about the things they have claimed to care the most about. They ignore obvious solutions to their problems while courting disaster at every opportunity. The whole book smells of unnecessary stalling and needless drawing out of the story to me. We see new characters introduced, background and exposition given over pages and pages, only to have them die with no impact on the larger story whatsoever. In addition, Martin seems to have developed a taste for overuse of certain words, that he has never seems to have had before. This could very well be an editing problem, and  I suspect it is, because the whole book seems rife with such issues. I don't want to discourage anyone from reading Dance, because overall, I am glad I read it. However, I don't want to see this wonderful epic suffer from the Wheel of Time syndrome and stretch out to such an extent that it becomes unfinishable. I love A Song of Ice and Fire, and I love it's characters. I've hooked both my wife and several of her friends on these books, and remain a loyal fan. I hope Mr. Martin will return our loyalty, and remember that if we sometimes seem ungrateful for the work you put in, or whiney about the way something happens, it's only because you've done your job right, and made us love your world as much as you do.
0439023491|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised, this second book was a lot better than the previous. There was enough action to make for a quick read. I'm looking forward to reading the final book in the series.
0307346617|4.0|World War Z is a different kind of zombie novel.  Instead of telling a story in a traditional narrative, Brooks has structured the book as a faux oral history (of the zombie apocalypse, also known as World War Z, amongst other names) in the vein of the works of journalist Studs Terkel.  That is, each chapter of the book is ostensibly the edited transcript of an interview, with the narrator occasionally piping in to ask a question.<br /><br />The rather narrow sub-genre of zombie apocalypse novels tends to suffer from a lack of originality, so World War Z is a breath of fresh air.  The chosen conceit works, and it allows the author to explore questions seldom addressed in traditional zombie novels, for example, how a communist regime would react to a zombie infestation (if a communist regime is better suited than a democratic one for anything, it is the disposal of dead bodies) or how a retooled military would win back an \\"occupied\\" America.<br /><br />The book is structured chronologically, while the interviews jump between locations and interviewees.  The interviews cover the zombie war from early on in the outbreaks that eventually spread worldwide to efforts to root out remaining pockets of zombies after the war has been won.  A few of the countries covered include the U.S., China, Brazil, and Israel.  Soldiers, politicians, and regular citizens are all interviewed.<br /><br />Brooks is generally quite effective at maintaining the requisite subtlety for effective satire.  The sole exception is organized religion; it is shown in a uniformly negative light that rings untrue.  The social and political commentary is otherwise incisive (your mileage may vary, but good satire still works even if you do not agree with the point being made).  Part of the fun is trying to parse out the \\"real\\" story from the biases and misconceptions of the various interviewees and the interviewer, none of whom can be regarded as reliable.<br /><br />There is a high payoff for educated and current readers.  For example, 1984 is alluded to and two politicians are never named but have uncanny similarities to Howard Dean and Colin Powell, respectively.  A lot of the humor springs from the actions of these unnamed characters viewed in light of who they are actually intended to represent.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the format saps the book of the action and tension a book like this really needs.  But overall, World War Z is a welcome addition to the speculative fiction tradition of examining the outer bounds of human nature.current readers.

B00506NRBS|1.0|This book is primarily a self indulgent account of how to stumble into a niche business, mismanage it (as it continues to make money despite a lack of business skills) and then bail out when all of the poor management advice (or lack of) fails. It is 80 pages of generously spaced poor advice that is so not worth your time or money.
B001MEJY8W|3.0|This was a sick one... I really don't know what to think of this. It's about 2 orphan girls, one of them out to revenge themselves for being tortured as a kid by this family. She ends up going after the family/parents who tortured her. Also her friend ends up joining her there.<br /><br />You really dont know whats going on in this movie for the first 40 minutes. Its hard to tell who's nuts, who's not, whats happening, etc- As the movie progresses you find out more information and it just gets stranger and stranger. Then we come to find out what Martyrs means...<br /><br />I won't delve too much into the plot to give out anything but this was a sick piece of work. As in, the people who were the villains are one of the worst i've seen, but you find out they did it for a purpose. A purpose but still sick.<br /><br /> I am greatly disappointed by the end of this film. At least let me know what the \\"big secret\\" is if you're going to subject me to a movie this disturbing.<br /><br />The back of the dvd says \\" it will make you question the world as you know it\\"- well, yea it did make me question it but i've already thought of things like this, what length some people will go to to gain something for their benefit.<br /><br />4 stars for general all around goodness and concept. 3 because they didn't tell me anything at the end. As in they leave it a \\"mystery\\", which I don't like. If they were to reveal this secret I would have been impressed... but no, we get nothing but left without the big answer. Probably because the writer couldn't even think of what to say if the big secret was revealed, he couldn't even dream up something that good so he left it open ended... which disappointed me.<br /><br />As far as purchasing this, It depends what you value in a horror film. If you love gore and a disturbing plot then you'll enjoy it. If you like some explanation to a huge \\"secret\\" then you won't care for that part. I think I am correct when I say they didn't reveal the secret, if not, then whatever but it left me disappointed. I really hated the villains in the movie towards the end, then I was confused, then questioning, then disappointed.<br /><br />Good/Unique overall but some questions left unanswered..

0812548094|4.0|Condition was as stated and it arrived very quickly.  I appreciate that it stated book #2 because I was having a hard time keeping track and other posts did not specify which book # within the series.  I now have almost the entire series, thanks to amazon!
B0041KKYCY|4.0|This isn't one of those clones of an original movie, it's a remake with some slight tweeks... keeps true to the original yet has its own identity. It's about a girl who goes to the woods alone to write. A group of guys and the sheriff of the town end up messing with her and from there it gets worse. They do horrible things to her then try to kill her afterwards- After the whole ordeal, she ends up coming back to get revenge on them all in much more creative ways than the original did even.<br /><br />If you don't like horror or can't handle anything a little disturbing then I suggest you stay away from this one.<br /><br />I thought the acting was good, much better than the original. I liked the girl who played Jennifer and think she played a great victim but as far as the revenge part I think she could have been a tad meaner. As in, I didn't sense the true hate or vengeance in the victim- She was almost too sweet, even when she was doing the revenge. The acts weren't sweet, but her disposition and nature seemed to not convince me. At points it was a bit comical watching her play the bad part. But overall, it was good.<br /><br />I think it's better than the original and goes with the modern times without sucking like most remakes do. Recommended.
B004HD2ZIQ|5.0|First let me repent. Ive never really wanted to be a Motorhead fan. I always thought them not to be my cup of tea and always found better music to spend my money on. Ive been so wrong and it has taken me this 54 years yes 54 years to catch on. Motorhead belongs and I after diving in and buying Overkill and Rock and Roll I bought this one. I love this CD. I just got home from a bad day at work ripped open my new CD and just rocked and also laughed thats right. With lyrics like \\" good things come to those who wait but today most thing just suck \\" well yeah.     This music is for the old and the young. Like most of Motorhead its just straight ahead in your face rock and roll. Best of all it reminds me of early rock n roll, and we all wondered where that went? Well thanks Lemmie and Motorhead for never conforming never conceding and just bringing us some good ole rock and roll. I hope that those like me dive into unknown waters and emerse into this band and especially this cd. Doesnt matter if your old like me or young and looking for some good tunes, this one beats the crap out of 98% of whats out there right now including whats that band ? oh yeah Metallica. lol  Come oh buy this one and just give it a listen and then if your not smitten on Motorhead well I dont know what to tell ya ! Im gonna listen to my The World is Yours again and open a cold one, maybe a Jack n Coke to Lemmie.  CHEERS FELLOW ROCKERS !

0553801473|1.0|What a long-winded, cumbersome, mostly plotless disappointment!  George Martin seems to have gotten stuck on the eastern continent with Dany and Tyrion and lost his way.  Hundreds of new exotic names, places, cultures, and histories we have to force our way through just to follow the storyline of the remaining characters that haven't been killed off yet.  Hizar, Hizdar, Huzhar? How can we start taking sides in the palace intrigues of cities we only just learned about?  Why do we care?  Stop generating new characters and finish up with the stories we're already following!  Theon Greyjoy was a somewhat minor troublemaker character in the previous books but the fact that I was relieved when I got to his chapters says a lot about how bored and impatient I was in the rest of them.  SPOILER ALERT! Jon's chapters can be summed up with: he moved the wildings south and put some to work on the wall.  And got in arguments with Stannis and his men about it until a weak cliffhanger at the end.  Even Tyrion seems two-dimensional here.<br /><br />Everyone commenting here has most likely already read the previous four books and has a lot invested in the series.  And anyone commenting here just a few short days after the book's release was clearly as eager as I was to embrace this latest installment.  I expected to come out of this week short on sleep but rewarded for a long and patient wait.  Instead I'm tired, disappointed, and cranky.  As with every other fan, I really wanted to like Dance.  I did not.
B005DC68NI|5.0|I have been following Mr. Gaughran's blog for a couple of months now, and in this short amount of time, his blog has become the first one I check every day. He is a hard-working, talented writer with his finger on the pulse of indie publishing, and it is no surprise to me that his blog has become extremely popular. What I most enjoy about his blog is the concise, well-written articles on the industry. He is consistent, smart, and most of all, inspiring.<br /><br />That said, it's no surprise I enjoyed his book, \\"Let's Get Digital.\\"<br /><br />There are tons and tons of great indie writer blogs out there discussing the ins and outs of the industry...and I'm convinced that Gaughran reads almost all of them. If you are just starting out as an independent author...or even just considering jumping into the fray...this is an excellent place to start. Gaughran not only covers the whys and hows, but he covers the historical aspects of the industry, an optimistic view of the future, and then shares 33 success stories by other indie writers who have chosen to publish their own work.<br /><br />I am recommending this book to all my writer friends. At this point in the publishing game, whether you're a die-hard traditionalist or indie-minded, I think this is critical education for any writer in this day and age.
0553801473|1.0|'A Dance With Dragons' drags along at a snail's pace, leaving you literally begging Martin for something interesting to happen.<br /><br />When the few interesting parts do finally occur, you are already too beaten down by overly descriptive minutia to feel that the book has vindicated your hard earned reading time.<br /><br />And seriously, wtf is up with all the food and wine references? I've had my \\"fill\\" of Dornish wine. More substance please!<br /><br />I fear that the glory days of the 'A Song Of Ice And Fire' series and those wonderful first three books are long gone. It eerily reminds me of how the 'Star Wars' movies progressed: From entertaining and thrilling stories with characters you actually care about, to painfully tedious boredom.<br /><br />Fool me once (AFFC), shame on you. Fool me twice (ADWD), shame on me.<br /><br />I won't be pulled into buying another installment without being patient and reading the reviews first. Martin may not care about my time and what I feel is enjoyable, but I do.
0553208845|1.0|I read this book in school and I did not enjoy it whatsoever.  It was a slow read that I could not connect to despite studying Buddhism for a month in my history class.My entire class agreed this book was a drag, even those students who were normally very enthusiastic about the class reads had issues with this book. I would advise you to choose another book.
0802798225|5.0|I am a reader and have read hundreds of books... this one has become my new favorite. Sweet little moments are included to melt the readers heart and the end is better than expected! Amazing!! I would recondmend this to ANYONE!! You will love it.
0316098329|4.0|Room is an interesting novel, with strong echoes of the Joseph Fritzl case. 5 year old Jack lives alone in a locked room with his Ma and narrates the story through his own words. He is a mix of precocious omnivore of learning, and emotionally arrested infant. It is difficult to say how realistic the voice the author creates for Jack is, but she succeeds in producing some compelling scenes.<br /><br />Initially the narrative feels rather claustrophobic, set as it is in a single room, but then an escape plan is hatched and the narrative broadens out, in space and theme, to include more characters and reactions to this dreadful scenario.<br /><br />Overall an interesting and well crafted novel that is worth reading as a piece of contemporary literature tackling a hard hitting theme of child abuse.
1589795474|4.0|The Millionaire Next Door sets up the premise of the book by introducing who exactly the millionaire next door is. After reading this book, I didn't only envision movie stars or athletes as the only people who had a lot of wealth; I saw myself as well. The authors of the book did a very thorough examination of what the typical millionaire now looks like. A majority of them are our next-door neighbors who are small business owners who bought a used car. One point that was made was that we don't need to look like millionaires just to be one, and we shouldn't train our children to think that way either. These were only a few of the characteristics the book stated.     The book was very intriguing to read. It was filled with numbers and facts to back up stories and anecdotal evidence. The book gave a lot of strong points and had an inspirational undertone to it. However, I feel that all of the points that they were trying to make could have been made in 150 pages as opposed to the 250 that it dragged on to be, and it also tended to be repetitive throughout. The positives do outweigh the negatives in this book. Considering how fast debt is growing in America and for its people, it's almost a necessity to have factual books like this.     As a young college student, I already foresee in my future that I won't have a salary that reaches $100,000 annually. But The Millionaire Next Door has given me hopes that I too could be a millionaire. Kids who are venturing into college should be recommended to read this, even parents should read this as well. It is never too early or too late to start becoming \\"the millionaire next door.\\"
B004LWZW24|3.0|I saw this movie last night. And first thoughts are that the first part of this move is reasonable good. It has some scary parts to it. It has nice atmosphere for a scary movie. But then it all goes horribly wrong. When the family moves to their second house is when they find out the truth that their child is gone because he is an astro projectionist (really?) and has travelled out of his body (you can start to see the wreck coming from here). It starts to get very lame from here on out. It is basically a redo of poltergeist,[[ASIN:B000V4UFZK Poltergeist (25th Anniversary Edition)]] but not done as well. Where the other side is just hear and alluded to in poltergeist, it is actually shown in this movie (bad idea). It was not done well at all and should have been left to the imagination. Then you actually see the creature that is after their child and it looks like Darth Maul.  Then it has the same predictable ending as most scary movies. You think all is well but then it turns out it is not, enter insidious 2.
B004EPZ07K|5.0|it's about time dc put another superhero of thier's on screen. batman and superman are great, but kinda of getting old. it would be cool if they made a flash movie and a wonderwoman movie. com on dc marvel is kicking your butts in movies. this was a really good movie. i don't care what anyone says this movie was awesome. I hope they do a sequel. the story, special effcts and the actors are great. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
0553801473|2.0|I was disappointed in this book. AFFC was plodding and pointless and ADWD is more of the same. The suspense and urgency that existed in the first three books is absent in these last two. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen and it never did. GRRM really needs to stop taking two paragraphs to describe what everyone we encounter is wearing and/or eating each time we see them again. His obsession with clothing and food is tiresome. After ADWD I am no longer going to recommend this series to anyone. I'll read the next books because I have gone this far but at this point I really don't care if another book in the series ever gets completed.
1451629184|5.0|Jaycee Dugard is my hero. I know that she didn't have a choice about what happend to her and most of her life was survival. The reason she is my hero is how she has processed it. How she could go through THAT and still care about others is truley impacting. Thank you for sharing your story with us.
B0053F042G|5.0|I enjoyed most everything about \\"Source Code\\". Jake Gyllenhaal is charming as ever, with great support from Michelle Monaghan and always reliable Vera Fermiga. Loads of suspense, a somewhat clever script, and fine editing had me from moment one. It's really fun stuff, with the entire cast rolling with the punches. My only argument is that the usually reliable Jeffrey Wright was sorely miscast (was Michael Caine busy?). Duncan Jones' film is quite enjoyable, loaded with nuance and verve. I liked it a lot. Gyllenhaal never fails to charm.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|Simple concept executed very well.  I agree with another reviewer's comments that some combinations should be viable but are not, so trying to figure out the combinations can be challenging and frustrating.  Overall though very addicting and has me thinking of combinations even when not playing the game!
B003Y5H542|4.0|As many have mentioned, the animation/visuals are fantastic.  My 3 & 5 year olds really wanted to see this based on the previews.  I had read the reviews about it not being for kids and I wouldn't necessarily disagree with those reviews.  However, we watched the movie with the kids, prepping them in advance that we might not be able to finish it if I decided it was for \\"bigger kids.\\"  And yes, there was some dialogue that made me cringe a little, but the kids didn't seem to notice at all.  It usually happened so fast that it didn't seem to really register with them.  So we watched the whole movie and they both really enjoyed it.  I'm positive that many of the themes and gags were over their heads.  Anyway, I wouldn't be too scared off by the PG rating and the movie was pretty entertaining.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|As a massive, massive Harry Potter fan, this movie did not disappoint! The movie was visually stunning with beautiful scenery. The story stuck well with the book's version. What stood out to me in this film was Emma, Daniel and Rupert's growth as actors. We see them evolve into young adults and it was a highlight for me. The DVD itself was good, blu ray was stunning of course. I really enjoy the Maximum Movie Mode because of the interesting tidbits that were provided throughout. I'm hoping that they will do the same for the other films as well! The behind the scenes features were nice but I wish there were more. (hopefully in the future!) Fantastic movie/dvd!
B0054PSY2W|5.0|I think you have to have experienced some of these characters in real life to fully appreciate this movie.  Being from the south, I have KNOWN many of the caricatures created in this film.  George Clooney does an excellent job in the lead role as T. Everette McGill and Holly Hunter is hilarious as his ex-wife.  I have watched so many times I know most of the dialogue by heart.  Now I have said my piece and counted to three.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|I originally only went to see this film because I'm a huge fan of Aly Michalka. However, I was very pleasantly surprised by how funny it was! The laughs were nonstop. It had an original storyline with hilarious jokes. This is a great film!
0553801473|4.0|This book was a little too rambling for a five star rating, but good none the less.  It IS an epic tale after all.  Martin at least gives us glimpses of all the main characters whereas in FFC's he left some out entirely.  The frustration comes mainly in anticipating what comes next and we will have to wait a while to find out.  Martin has set up some foreshadowing (I hope) concerning one of the main characters, but he has never promised us even in the first book that those characters we know and love will make it to the end.  Whether he is pruning characters to make the last battle solely between good and evil or just playing with us remains to be seen.  I am invested in the story and will see it to the bitter or triumphant end.  At least I will have the HBO series to keep me company while he writes the conclusion.

B0055D3EOG|2.0|There's a guy in my office that occasionally hides under my work desk and yells \\"BOO\\" when I return from the restroom. Sometimes he jumps out from the coat closet near the front door, or hides behind the wall adjacent to the office kitchen. Every time he uses the same lame \\"BOO\\" scream because he's too stupid to properly construct an effective scare. It worked the first few times but now it's totally worthless. He can't scare me. I, on the other hand, will occasionally hide behind his door in the morning before he arrives. His office lights are usually off and the lighting is dim. He'll walk into his office, feel someone's presence, turn around and see a shadow near the door. Is it a part of his imagination or is it real? He squints his eyes for a few seconds and then notices that someone is actually there. It scares the crap out of him every time, and I don't even need to scream \\"BOO!\\" Ironically, sometimes when I don't do it he'll stop by my office and say, \\"Man, I thought I saw you this morning.\\"     This very basic difference between amateur shock tactics and well-constructed sequences of terror is something that 21st Century American filmmakers ignore with reckless abandon. In case you hadn't noticed, the American horror industry has sucked for quite some time, and one major reason is that they almost always go for the cheapest, laziest routes to producing scares. In the case of Insidious, it's jump scares supplemented with 100-decibel piano/violin BOOMs. If Insidious limited itself to 2 or 3 such moments (or even 4 or 5), then it could have saved enough room for more mature, expertly crafted horror elements. Unbelievably, Insidious tosses in approximately 20 jump scares, an unacceptable descent into unprecedented laziness. The condensed nature of the jumps falls prey to the law of diminishing returns. It would be like the guy at my office jumping in front of me and yelling \\"BOO\\" every 3 minutes. It quickly becomes a parody of itself.    Brian Salisbury from \\"Film School Rejects\\" makes some good points in his review of Insidious, so I'd like to quote him here: \\"Seriously, horror filmmakers: put a moratorium on jump scares. I know everyone and their brother is using jump scares as a counterattack against increasingly desensitized audiences, but it's time to give up the ghost (pun only slightly intended). I got sick and tired of something popping up like Jack-in-the-Box every five seconds obscuring my vision from the much more interesting, and far scarier, story going on behind it. Jump scares are the junk food of horror films - providing only superficial and extremely temporary sensory nourishment. Soon enough, your brain is hungry again for that fear response and jump scares are about as substantial as eating a box of Twinkies on Thanksgiving Day. When you watch the Oscars and the category of Achievement in Sound Mixing comes up (you know, when you normally make a trip to the bathroom), you may ponder on the value of a film's sound mixer or sound designer. Five minutes into Insidious, you will understand the dire necessity of these artists if only by virtue of the fact that we're subjected to their spectacular failures for 90 minutes. Every apparition carries with it its own deafening shriek and every jump scare is heralded with an explosion of disharmonious (read: eardrum-shredding) violins. It seems to be operating under the same delusion as Drag Me to Hell that loud = scary. But, along with jump scares, incessant loud noises are the charlatans of fright. We are not infants, so please refrain from resorting to the same tactics that terrify barely cognitive life forms.\\"     That sums things up nicely. The praise that Insidious has earned for it's cheap scare tactics should be concerning for fans of the genre, because a transition from the recent torture/gore trend towards jump scare compilations isn't much of a progression for the pitiable American horror industry. Take away the 100-decibel piano/violin BOOMs and almostnone of the jumps will work on your mainstream cinephile. (And by \\"work\\" I'm using the generous term \\"startle\\", which is probably the laziest way to scare someone.) The storyline is stupid, the acting is mediocre at best, the dialogue ranges from decent to lame, and the dramatic elements are limp. The only true positive is the fairly brisk pacing that keeps things from getting unbearably boring.    Despite everyone I know complaining about my biased preference for Japanese and South Korean horror, it's pretty damn obvious that my fellow Americans are simply too incompetent to construct long-sustained sequences of terror, produce dense atmosphere, develop interesting psychological/philosophical elements, use ambiguity properly, patiently utilize deliberate pacing to build tension, or supplement horror with good story lines and characters. If Insidious is the creme de la creme of modern American horror, then it's time to write an epitaph.

0143038095|2.0|The Joy Luck Club by Amy Tan was a very slow read and I had a very difficult time getting into the story.  What was interesting to me was that the women were so rude to one another although there were glimpses of kindness.  These women lived in difficult times, indured injustice and yet they didn't support one another with graciousness. Amy Tan reveals the Chinese culture and the difficult transition from China to America.  This story begs the question \\"How well do you really know your mother?\\"

B002QKZLZ6|5.0|[[ASIN:B0027FFZEW Plantronics Voyager PRO Bluetooth Headset]] I purchased a Plantronics Voyager Pro + Bluetooth Headset at Best Buy (wanted it THAT day.) At $100 (much cheaper on Amazon for around $70), I did not want to just throw it in my purse, car, or loose in dresser drawer. The store did not carry them which is an oversight I think. These things can be kind of fragile and I don't want to purchase another. This is a very high quality case and fits the headset perfectly. I am very happy with it. I like the magnetic closure and handy clip for carrying or just attaching to purse.

It is surprisingly moderate in cost.  Get it!!  Read it!!

There are twists and turns throughout this book that will keep readers hooked.  I loved the character of Lisbeth--a researcher/computer hacker with her own set of dysfunctions.  She kicked ass.  I had heard that this book started off slowly and it did a bit (a lot of background information and people all at once) but once it picked up, boy did it pick up!  I really enjoyed this book and have the others in the series to read (this is the first book in the series).  I recommend this book.<br /><br />[...]
0553801473|4.0|I can understand why some people are frustrated by this book, but if you come into it with the right mindset it's a very enjoyable read.  If you just want to rush through the story and find out what happens you are going to hate this book.  Books 4+5 are quite different from 1-3, they require a willingness to just slow down and live with the characters for a while.  You also need to be willing to hear a lot about what is going on outside of Westeros.  If you take the attitude that everything Daenerys does until she gets to Westeros is a waste of time you are not going to like this book at all.  I enjoyed Dance much more than Feast, I'd much rather hear about Meereen than Brienne wandering Westeros.  I can't give it 5 stars because of Martin's overuse of cliffhangers.  It was understandable in Feast but to do the same thing again is just too much.
B004AHNIGM|5.0|I ordered this CD when it first came out and popped it the player in my car. I had gotten back into a lot of Allman Brothers music as part of a jam band period (that I'm still in). I was ready for some up-tempo ABB-like stuff and this just was NOT it. So, back in a pile it went.<br /><br />But for something different last weekend I played a House of Blues collection of Chicago Blues and it really hit a chord (as this music always does when I'm ready for it). So then, back this goes in the player and \\"wow.\\" Gregg Allman still has a lot of power in his delivery, and this is a very tasteful, respectful take on some real blues material - some of it familiar and a lot of it not as much.<br /><br />But so well done...and so worth a good listen.

B003Y5H542|3.0|I made the mistake of watching this with my 2 and 4 year old girls.  Big Mistake.    \\"I want to watch you die\\" said by one of the characters in the film.  \\"Damn.\\" \\"Hell.\\"  \\"You're from Hell.\\"     Since my 3 year old repeats everything, I could foresee her saying all of that, and \\"I want to watch you die\\" is not something I find entertaining coming out of a 3 year old's mouth.  That may be cute for your kids to say... not mine.    There's a preview in a nutshell.  Ya... maybe for 7 and older Boys it'd be a good movie.    If you like turning your children on to cursing at a young age and talking about some sociopathic tendencies to get thrills out of watching people die, then go for it.    Not for my kiddos.  I wouldn't recommend it for any kid younger than 7-8.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|When I watched it on DVD years ago, I thought it was funny. I finally bought the whole set, and watched it again.  Still liked it somewhat  Even bought the film.      But the last time I watched it, I thought it was boring and silly and found myself fast forwarding through half of it.  Nobody acts like that, At least I hope not. I mean ALL the conversation was about sex.  All of it.  Sigh.....  Occasionally they talked clothes or shoes, but most all of it was about sex, and Samantha was ridiculous.  Does anybody really dress the way they did and act as disgusting as Samantha?  I hope not.  Carrie should have thrown Big out of her mind, after his sudden trip to Paris and combed her hair once in a while. Aiden was a nice guy, but it seems Carrie didn't like nice guys.   Miranda just didn't work with the bartender, although he was one of the few nice characters in the movie.  And Samantha and her waiter/movie star completely insane.  I threw the whole thing out.  I would have given away, but nobody wanted it.

B003EV6DBM|5.0|The 2009 series of specials, which ended the tenure of the tenth incarnation of The Doctor, left us on a fairly bitter note. No one can deny the popularity of David Tennant's Tenth Doctor, rivaling only Tom Baker's Fourth Doctor. This has left numerous new-school fans feeling bitter toward Matt Smith's Eleventh Doctor.<br /><br />Tennant is a tough act to follow, admittedly. But one thing that becomes immediately apparent is that Smith isn't trying to replace Tennant. As every actor before him, Matt Smith makes his incarnation of The Doctor his very own. Additionally, this series is written as a jumping-on point for new viewers, making references to events from earlier seasons few and far between. However, as with series 1 through 4, series 5 has an arcing plot (mostly) culminating at the finale. The individual episodes are written to have a completely new feel compared to the series before it. And here we reach another bump in the road...<br /><br />Many fans of both the classic serials and the revival series feel the changes in formula for series 5 are uncomfortable. I respectfully disagree; change is a constant throughout Doctor Who in general. With every regeneration, The Doctor (and the audience) must rediscover and reinvent himself. This iteration deals with more human storytelling, with more emotional investment than most iterations before it.<br /><br />Matt Smith's Eleventh Doctor is certainly one of the quirkiest yet unusually charming incarnations and my personal third favorite, only behind Jon Pertwee's Third Doctor and Christopher Eccleston's Ninth. Without revealing too much, the stories told in this series are amazingly written, and the rogues featured include classic foes such as the Daleks and newer threats like the Weeping Angels. Series 5 is one that shouldn't be missed.

0345522478|4.0|Kevin Hearne first came on to my attention in the last quarter of 2010 when I read about Hounded and the Iron Druid Chronicles on a blog. After happening upon the book's description and learning about the quick release schedule of the series, I was entranced and wanted to see if Hounded would stack up against the hype it had been receiving.<br /><br />Hounded begins with a soliloquy by Atticus O'Sullivan who is actually a 2100-year-old Irish druid, older than the world's largest religion and apparently the last of his kind. His real name is Siodhachan O'Suileabhain, but for reasons revealed in the blurb, he chooses to modernize himself. He gives the reader his background history in a neat manner, while fending off an attack by five of the Fae. He also learns that this attack is orchestrated by Aenghus Og, the Celtic god of Love. He beats his attackers, but is put on alert by this event since he chose Arizona for its scarcity of Oak, Ash and Thorn, which are required for the Fae/Sidhe to cross over into our realm.<br /><br />As Atticus contemplates their presence and the meaning of their attack, he's interrupted by the appearance of Morrigan, the Irish War goddess and slayer of the chosen. She has been on friendly terms with Atticus since the origin of his feud, and warns him about dire omens and his impending death at the hands of Aenghus Og. The reasons for this particular feud are because Atticus, in his youth, stole the legendary sword Fragarach from Aenghus Og's chosen champion. Atticus discusses his situation with Morrigan who inquires about his particular type of magic, which explains series' title, and then extracts a promise from him without giving him a promise in return, leaving Atticus with a sense of foreboding.<br /><br />Next, Atticus is visited by Flidais, the Celtic goddess of the hunt, who relates the same tale told by Morrigan, but with an alteration as to who else is coming. Here, there is a small but important info-dump which reveals the nature of Atticus' lawyers Hauk (a werewolf) and Lief (a vampire). Atticus agrees to go on a hunt with Flidais and Oberon, an Irish wolfhound mentally bound to Atticus. Thus begins the events which fuel the tale that is Hounded. Other subplots include a witch who requests Atticus's apothecary skills in return for help/favour from her Coven, and the bartender Granuaile MacTiernan, who's more than she appears to be.<br /><br />Kevin Hearne's writing is competent, led by skillful prose that adds to the book's refreshing setting and protagonist. Atticus as the narrator particularly excels. Even though he's the hero of the story, you can discern certain moral ambivalences from his actions since Atticus is a bit of a rogue when the situation demands it. For instance, Atticus relates his own versions of various historical moments, but these accounts seem a bit shady. Overall, Atticus is lovable and trustworthy, but he's also the sort of chap you wouldn't want as your enemy.<br /><br />Humor is one of the major plus points in Hounded, with the dialogue/banter between Oberon and Atticus the highlight of the book. In particular, Oberon's fascination with Genghis Khan, his love for Poodles and the ultimate allure of hunting, all of which increases the reader's fun quotient. Another promising front is the multitude of mythologies utilized in the book, which are reflective of the real world. The author's use of mythology is very smartly executed, while providing enough of an explanation to satisfy the reader's curiosity. Lastly, the pace of the book never lets up, with Atticus going from plot point to plot point with as few breaks as possible, thus creating a sense of urgency for the reader.<br /><br />Negatively, the book has a bit of a PG-13 feel to it. For example, bad things occur, but the author has them wrapped up neatly to lessen their darkness. There is also quite a bit of info-dumping in the first fifty pages of the book, but since Hounded is the opening volume in a series, itwas necessary for the author to lay out all this information for the reader. Plus, it was easy to overlook the info-dumping since it was presented in an entertaining manner through engaging character dialogue. Finally, urban fantasy stories tend to be predictable and Hounded does not differentiate much in that regard. It remains to be seen if Kevin Hearne will be able to deviate from the norm and give readers a more refreshing story throughout the rest of the series.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: Despite a few deficiencies, Hounded is a very good debut which introduces a worthy and refreshing urban fantasy setting and a clever, yet morally dubious protagonist. I was especially amazed by how polished Kevin Hearne's debut was and anxiously look forward to reading the remainder of the series ASAP!<br /><br />Short Story review: \\"Clan Rathskeller\\" is a free short story featured on the author's website. It is twenty-six pages long and the events in the tale are set about ten months prior to Hounded. It is also be included in the e-book version of Hounded.<br /><br />The short story begins with Atticus and Oberon chilling in the Tempe Market place. Amidst their banter, Oberon notes that there's something inhuman about the Santa giving out presents to the kids assembled. A quick glance by Atticus reveals that Santa's helper elves aren't elves at all, but gnomes. His curiosity overrides his safety instincts and he instructs Oberon to fetch one of the gnomes who then reveals its identity in return for Atticus's own. They also reveal that they are awaiting a certain member of the Tuatha D&eacute; Danann and thought Atticus was doing the same. From here, the reasons for the gnomes' presence is laid bare and Atticus & Oberon have to decide whether they wish to get involved or not.<br /><br />\\"Clan Rathskeller\\" is well-paced and readers without any knowledge of the series will be able to jump right in and understand what's going on. Kevin Hearne manages to insert enough of the characters' background in the story to make it feel a part of the larger series, but it also works well as a short introduction to Atticus O'Sullivan and the urban fantasy world he inhabits.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Clan Rathskeller\\" is a very enjoyable read and I would ask readers to give this short story a try before deciding on Hounded and the rest of the series, since it encapsulates very well the nature of the books.

0553801473|3.0|I just finished ADWD and I have to say that I am disappointed with the book. I was hopeful in the beginning and toward the middle but as I neared the end, I realized that many of my favorite characters were either left in precarious situations or in dangerous and dull situations. Too many pieces of the plot were left dangling without resolve and not in a good cliffhanging way. It seems like the author just said to himself, \\"And that's enough of that story line for this book\\" even though the end of the conflict hadn't occurred yet.<br />One of my favorite parts of the book was the \\"battle\\" in the North; however, that wasn't really resolved too much either.It was interesting seeing the story from the perspective of a certain loathed character who you really just pity all during the book.<br />I was really disappointed with Dany's storyline because she used to be one of my favorite characters before this book. The author seemed to change her character from strong and determined to cautious and self-indulgent. Her story line became as bogged down as her occupation of Mereen.<br />Jon had some good chapters, but still disappointing in it's lack of excitement. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen...<br />Tyrion had a moderately good story line, but there wasn't much movement in his storyline either. He moved physically from West to East, but that was about it.<br />Arya's was very much like what we saw in AFFC.<br />There were some new characters who made the book interesting and also some old ones who didn't need to be apart of it like Cersei.<br />Overall, I will be glad when Winds of Winter comes out, and I will definitely read it, and I hope to find that a certain character has survived.

You apparently have to go into the app itself to check off which items will be included.  On my system with GO Launcher EX, I can just make a folder and drag an app or a game to it (can't remember if this is a stock feature or GO, but it works and it's free).  This app adds a bunch of convoluted steps.  Try GO Launcher as it's free on the Android Market and has a lot of little extras.

B004V6MWFU|4.0|My review is for fans or Pearl Jam adepts. This album is not really what one can expect from Eddy Vedder.....would be the first thought that passes most minds. Other more broad minds ( no offense to others )won't be suprised with this suprising concept. Fans familiar with the album \\"into the wild \\" will agree.  Anyway, now is your chance to get this album in the original packaging. Knowing the recordcompanies, the next issue would be in standard jewelbox.
B00005JNTX|5.0|It's a gritty, film noir comic movie and one good piece of work.  I like anything with Bruce Willis in it and he's good in this piece, as expected.  If you like pulpy, dark comic books, Bruce Willis, and film noir, this film is a must-see.
B004LROMSY|2.0|Over dramatic tween soup opera that happens to have nudity and violence, grown men crying and whining for all the wrong reasons, and quite frequently too, maybe it's called metro-medieval?     Glaring, brooding, and basically giving each other the evil eye throughout the episodes, doesn't translate to good acting either. Enough already! The producers should have waited a year and gotten a sneak peek of Game of Thrones and used that as a guideline for making a epic show, where both women and men can be strong and sensitive and not necessarily having to resort to weeping for cheap drama. If anyone else is going to do a show of over dramatic seriousness of this magnitude, they should consider throwing in some humor here and there to insure that the viewers don't completely fall into a mental depression after each episode.     I was waiting for Merlin to spit chewy tobacco throughout, but he never did. I think I did see him spit though.     I could tell the evilness of Morgan, just based on the amount of eyeliner that was applied and the strength of her glare. I figured the less glaring she did in a scene, the less evil she was for that moment.    Ummm,..what else....Arthur was your average 16 year old drama queen, and a momma's boy, and turns out he was nothing special. Exactly where did he put his virtue? I don't remember seeing it at all.
0316098329|5.0|Jack is five years old and has lived in Room his whole life. He sleeps in Wardrobe, does Phys Ed, and really wants a dog for his birthday. Ma lives in Room with Jack. She's been there ever since Old Nick snatched her off the street when she was 19.  While Jack delights in the safe world Ma has created for him, Ma knows better and hatches a plan that will change their lives forever.  Although the subject matter might seem disturbing, Emma Donoghue does a remarkable job of crafting a story about perseverance, hope, and the power of a mother's love. It's a story about Jack's and Ma's journey, not about \\"what happened\\" to Ma. The story is made even more compelling because Jack serves as the narrator. His unique perspective makes this book a study on the nature of reality, as much as a tale of a family overcoming an unimaginable situation.
0307716511|2.0|Blergh.  This book was touted and advertised a lot as a \\"thriller\\" and yet it was boring to me. I'm not a big writer but I love to read and I want to be taken away by what I read. This title was so promising and the premise was too, but the actual guts of the storyline and the letters written to the dead sister made me literally roll my eyes. I cannot recommend this one.  While it wasn't awful, it just wasn't that good either.  I prefer to spend my time reading fantastic reads. To \\"sell\\" or \\"market\\" this as a thriller?  Misleading.

It is both comical and dark but sure to please all audiences. Michael C.

Touted as a Western, it takes forever to get to the 'bad town'.  I rented this at Red Box and the dollar charge is way too much to pay. I have to wonder who paid the people who gave this great reviews. I was looking for a fun Western with kookie characters -- which is what the previews made this look like.  Maybe it got better in the second half, but we (my wife and I) couldn't get through the first 30 minutes.   Next time I'll check this kind of movie out at the library.
0441013597|5.0|This is the Dune we all know and love.  So you know what you're getting in terms of the novel.  There are plenty of reviews on this book by people much more well informed and educated on literature than I am, so I will not try to go there.    This printing is a cheap, small paperback so it's perfect for what I wanted!  The printing was great in terms of accuracy and precision.  Whether you're a newcomer to Dune, or you read it years ago in your childhood this would be a great edition for anyone.
0896898288|5.0|The letters contained within this book are wonderful to read.  I am also using the CD and templates to piece the 111 blocks along with a group of over 700 women and it has been fantastic!  Really a great book for both the letters and to get experience with little known quilt blocks.
B001UV4XFG|1.0|I would expect a franchise that is apparently so successful to actually be good. After watching two disappointing films, the third just makes me want to dig a hole in the back yard and curl up into a fetal position. I don't seem to see what is good about these films, so I must be going crazy.<br /><br />This film is poorly written, the acting talent is not even there. The worst part is that there are two decent young actresses in this film in Dakota Fanning and Bryce Dallas Howard. Yet, they barley get any screen time in this movie. For a movie that was suppose to give me an incredible epic battle of Vampire vs. Vampire and Ware-wolf...I am left with just a cheap blur of second rate special effects. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson again horrible and Taylor Lautner is so pathetic in his delivery of dialogue. I mean...\\"Let's face it...I'm hotter than you???!!!' Someone crank out the crackers because I was just thrown a butt-load of cheese. I even wonder why I am wasting my time watching these, maybe it's because of my deep longing to finish projects I have started...and know that it is important not to knock something unless you have tried it.<br /><br />Yes, I will see the final two films and yes I will give my thoughts. I am not trying to be biased because I am a huge Harry Potter fan, but I have seen all of those and unlike Twilight they actually try to improve on their mistakes and always try to make every following attempt better than the last. I also have nothing against Pattinson because I loved him in the film 'Water For Elephants' Frankly, once Twilight is over he will be able to bask in the glory in all of his Twilight royalties, and even if Twilight keeps getting the MTV best movie awards, I feel that in about 20 years no one will even understand the question 'So what are you, team Edward or Jacob?'
0073398101|5.0|This is probably as good as it gets when it comes to aerospace reading material. Very easy to read and understand. This book is very well organized, and helps you to understand the relevance of each topic. It takes you by the hand and nicely walks you though complicated concepts like it wasn't rocket science.

B000BTC5LW|4.0|Great audio and most of the video.  The cameras moved a bit too much and sometimes, the closeup of the video that the band had playing on a screen above them would make a confusion as they switched back and forth.  I think the camera, when highlighting the video, would have been much better to keep the band in view by backing off a little on the zoom.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|There's really nothing I can add to the 399 reviews that were posted before me, so I'll cut to the chase:<br /><br />After watching bits and pieces of the Matrix movies in standard def on AMC on my [[ASIN:B004RTL1YY Samsung PN59D8000 59-Inch Plasma]], I got the itch to see what my television was really made of. The reviews here on Amazon confirmed that this box set was up to par in terms of video and audio quality -- unlike the disappointing, un-remastered [[ASIN:B000W4HIY0 Die Hard Blu-Ray Collection]] on sale at my local Fry's this week -- so I figured it'd give it a shot.<br /><br />Popping the first disk in to my [[ASIN:B004N85YD8 Samsung BD-D6700 Blu-ray Player]], the movie booted up quickly and began playing immediately, even bypassing the menu. Great!<br /><br />My wife, who up to this point has expressed her confusion in exactly what benefit Blu-ray is supposed to bring to her movie watching experience, suddenly \\"saw the light\\" in such obscure details as facial features and little interior details, like the wood grain on a door to Room 303, lighting effects onboard the ship, or the crispness of the the \\"I know Kung Fu\\" training scenes -- the types of details she's either ignored or been oblivious to in other Blu-ray discs we've watched.<br /><br />We're not hard-core Matrix fans, yet enjoyed the included Animatrix disc. What is obviously absent is the \\"follow the white rabbit\\" extras from the original DVD box set.<br /><br />All in all, this set is a great demonstration of the cinematic qualities of a good, large-screen television and Blu-ray, and has a place on anybody's shelf who wants to have a classic on-hand to show off to curious friends, or fill a little down-time on the couch.
0345444051|4.0|***This review may contain spoilers***<br /><br />The late Arthur C. Clarke's \\"Childhood's End\\" (hereafter CE) really ultimately has a superficial science fiction facade.  Even as it purposefully distracts the reader (and all of Earth's denizens) with descriptions of Overlord culture, their planetary composition, and their vast technological mastery employed to transform the Earth into a secular, scientific utopia, CE is adamantly a religious, or more accurately a spiritual, treatise.  Like a relatively few novels, it dares to confront and even embrace the infinite.  Furthermore, the novel suggests there are at least three ways to merge with the infinite, and none of these ways is entirely satisfying.<br /><br />CE's spiritual ambience begins practically from the beginning, when astronomically large space vessels position themselves over every major Earth capital.  The main vessel hovers over New York and communicates (somewhat naively to our eyes) with the United Nations and the Secretary General Rikki Stormgren.  Stormgren communicates with the putative Overlord leader Karellen, but even he is not allowed to view Karellen.  Karellen deliberately explains this is so because Earth is not prepared to behold the Overlords' physical appearance.  Stormgren, like a dutiful Moses, executes Karellen's dictates for world improvement.  Although Karellen describes himself as a mere \\"Supervisor\\", CE's allusions to him practically make him God.  Examples: the paraphrased passage that people were impatient to see who ruled them (just as many of us are impatient to view the face of God), Karellen's seeming immortality, Karellen's ultimately being unknown and unknowable. Nonetheless, Stormgren wishes to see Karellen's face because, like Moses, the Secretary General will not be present to see the promised land the Overlords will eventually unveil.  He partially succeeds; though the novel does not explicitly describe it, Stormgren sees a portion of Karellen - part of a barbed, demonic tail protruding from a doorway that the Supervisor exits.<br /><br />On the day the Overlords finally reveal themselves to mankind, they ironically appear as the Christian manifestation of the Devil, with horns, wings, and barbed tail (no mention of hooves though).  But because of their intercession to improve the world, most people are not alarmed.  In fact, in a bit of foreshadowing, Karellen summons two children to visit the landed ship, they enter, and Karellen emerges carrying each in one arm.  Earth gets to see their \\"Messiah\\".<br /><br />After CE distracts us some more with the technological, biological, and social advancements the Overlords make to make Earth a paradise, it veers toward a party in a house in Africa.  The house owner Rupert Boyce presides.  After the party, Rupert invites several party goers to participate in a kind of seance with an unusual Ouija board.  Future marrieds George and Jean and frustrated romantic space enthusiast Jan Rodericks are among the participants.  Surprisingly, also present is the Overlord Rashaverak, who is there to peruse Rupert's paranormal library and to observe the seance.  This puzzles George, who is astonished that the scientifically inclined Overlords would dabble in the silly occult.  At any rate, Rupert conducts the seance experiment.  Nothing remarkable happens until Jan asks the question \\"Which star is the Overlord's son?\\".  Amazingly, the Ouija Board provides an answer \\"NGS + number\\".  Who in the seance answered the question?  There seems to be only a spiritual explanation.<br /><br />From this point, CE follows two pragmatic trends: 1) Jan uses the seance's knowledge to smuggle himself into an Overlord ship returning to the homeworld, 2) George and Jean get married, have children, and move to an artistic island colony to preserve some vestiges of Earth culture, which Earth's techonological advancement has stifled.  Even so, the spiritual elements remain strong.  In Jan's case, he hides, Jonah-like, in areplica of a sperm whale being transported by the ship.  In George and Jean's case, they slowly and shockingly realize that their children Jeffrey and Jennifer are gradually being possessed by a mysterious force.  This eventually links back to the night of the seance by the revelation that Jean answered Jan's question and the only way she could do so was, unbelievably, communing with her unborn son!!!  Powers beyond scientific reckoning are emerging.<br /><br />The possession eventually overtakes all of Earth's children.  As Karellen finally explains, this is being instigated by the mysterious entity known as the Overmind.  This possession and absorption of the children into the Overmind's being is necesssary to prevent Earthling's dabblings with the paranormal from upsetting the universal balance.  Adults are not absorbed because their minds are less pliant and less susceptible to the Overmind's training.  The Overmind is a conglommeration of numerous races - and Earth is only the latest to be honored with this apotheosis.  Karellen also reveals that for some inexplicable reason, the Overmind has chosen their race to prepare other planetary cultures for absorption.  Earth's people can do nothing and eventually destroy themselves in impotent anguish.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Jan makes it to the Overlords' homeworld and immediately finds himself out of his depth.  With no frame of references, the planet seems illogical, enigmatic, and literally hellish.  Jan would have gone mad without the timely arrival of another Overlord, Vindarten, who acts as guide, liaison, and interpreter.  He views various phenomena, including a life-size replica of an eye of a planet-sized cyclopean beast, and a multi-colored vortex which is eventually revealed as part of the Overmind.  Though Jan does not understand everything (as Karellen intoned, \\"The stars are not for Man.\\", his space curiosity is satisfied and he eagerly takes the next Overlord ship back for home.<br /><br />A devastating surprise awaits Jan upon his return from Earth.  Mankind is practically extinct.  The possessed children have been gathered into one continent - awaiting union with the Overmind.  The union eventually occurs; Jan agrees to remain behind on Earth to record his impressions of this union as the Overlords depart, their work done.  Jan accomplishes his task; as the union is consummated, the Earth is leeched out of existence.  Karellen journeys back to his world to reluctantly but resolutely await his next assignment from the Overmind.<br /><br />CE begins with the premise that infinity and immortality exist.  Next, it posits there are three paths to infinity and immortality: 1) become an unconscious component of the Overmind collective, 2) remain an advanced, conscious, eternal servant of the Overmind, like the Overlords, and 3) conventional death, where there may or may not be an afterlife.  CE, through Karellen, seems to champion the first path, though it hedges its bets by not condemning any earthling resistance to the Overmind.  Even though the first way is touted as the next step toward human evolution, I'm not so sure.  That may be true, but we would not be aware of it. Contrary to CE's pronouncement, it would not be fulfillment to me, but tragedy.  Losing consciousness and identity seems frightening.  Almost as frightening is conventional death, where we may or may not maintain consciousness after death.  To my mind, the Overlord's path, though not perfect, seems most suitable.  They maintain their identities and egos, and they get to roam the universe and visit interesting cultures as they nobly preserve the universal balance.ed by the ship.

0307477479|5.0|Title: A Visit From the Goon Squad    Author: Jennifer Egan    Publisher: Random House    Rating: 5 Shots of Espresso (Coffee Shakes)    I purchased Egan's A Visit From the Goon Squad due to its 2011 Pulitzer Prize win for Fiction. I decided to see why it was placed next to novels like Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird and Toni Morrison's Beloved and I am beginning to understand why.    Jennifer Egan's Pulitzer Prize winning novel, A Visit From the Goon Squad, follows a group of self-indulging people who live in the moment and rarely beyond it. The novel begins and ends with three characters-Sasha, Alex and Bennie-who connect each other to music, pop culture and other characters. Each of the thirteen chapters could easily be their own short story, but the cleaver and endless threads that Egan sews together make each chapter a new reveling entity to the tragic and very real lives of each character. These characters are genuine and true to the people who live in our communities; for every character I was reminded of someone I had encountered in my own life. Egan's novel takes us into the worlds of each character who tries to find a place and an identity although most choose their personal need of instant gratification. While all the characters have their unflattering moments, there was only one who I just couldn't empathize with-Lou...the raunchy and despicable music producer; there are just some things that are simply immoral. Egan exposes the raw aspects of human nature by attempting to provide the material conditions of why someone would act in a particular way.    Jennifer Egan's A Visit From the Goon Squad valiantly examines pop culture from the last forty years or so and depicts the humanness of particular cultures. Egan demystifies the cultural myths and legends and puts a face to those who have participated. I give Egan's A Visit to the Goon Squad five shots of espresso because of her ability to expose society in a personal manner that keeps you wanting more.Egan captures American pop culture and predicts where it may go if the goon squad continues to visit.

014241493X|4.0|Margo Roth Spiegelman changes Q's life in just one night. She's listened to the gossip mills and has discovered that her best friend is hooking up with her boyfriend. So she decides to get even. She crawls into the window of her childhood friend Q and convinces him to drive the get away car. Q has the night of his life and adventures to last him the rest of his life. He's anxious for morning to stroll into school and see Margo and how the revenge has changed people. But Margo's not there. She's not there the next day either. In fact Margo's skipped town once again. This time Q feels an empty hole in his stomach. He vows to find her leaving the clues she left behind.<br /><br />First off, this was a great story. And it's being made into a movie by the same people who made Juno. So that's really cool. Secondly, I have no idea why there are two covers. I really think the blue one suits the book more as being mysterious and dark, but it just occurred to me that the yellow cover might signify fun-loving-adventurous Margo. Good story: adventure, friendship, road trip. John Green ROCKS!

B0041T52S6|5.0|This movie is hilarious but the humor is a sophisticated dry wit in the style of Juno or Napoleon Dynamite so it will appeal more to those fans than to a general audience.  It will also appeal more to young males rather than females due to its video game based theme.  Highly recommended.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|When George started killing characters that I loved, I bit the bullet and plowed on, thinking that it would be all right in the end, that some of them would prevail and \\"win\\" if you will, but it seems as if he knows no other plot twist than to kill off many of the characters and then maybe bring them back with the \\"magic\\" we were told was not that prevalent in this world. Martin has \\"lost the plot\\", quite literally.  He has lost control of his characters and the narrative and knows no way to contritely wrap up a storyline. The story goes nowhere in book five and a character that I have been rooting for since book one may have been killed off, making all of his efforts wasted, if this is so, it is a disgrace, but even more so if he is brought back by some mystical rite. I have lost all faith in this series, add another one-star to the pile.

0553801503|1.0|First 3 books are excellent. This is one disappointing, lame excuse for a 4th book. Read the other reviews. I have nothing to add. They are correct.  Most of the characters and story lines in the other books have been abandoned. Did he forget what he wrote in the 3rd book?

0312323867|4.0|Darcy Rhone has a rough life. She's with a guy who doesn't adore and worship her like the ex-fiance that she cheated on.  He's also not as \\"presentable\\" as her former fiance, Dex, and she's pregnant as a result of the illicit affair.  Boo hoo.  Furthermore, Darcy refuses to have anything to do with her best and childhood friend, Rachel, who fell in love with said ex-fiance.<br /><br />I must admit that I never really had any desire to read Emily Giffin's books until I saw the \\"[[ASIN:B004EPZ070 Something Borrowed]]\\" movie and loved it.  I enjoyed the characters in the movie so much that I wanted to see what happened next.  Thankfully, I discovered that Giffin had written a sequel.  The first few chapters of SOMETHING BLUE covered the end of the movie (and probably the related book), so it served as a rehash, lest the reader forget what happened.<br /><br />Unlike [[ASIN:0312321198 SOMETHING BORROWED]] which was told from sweet Rachel's point of view, SOMETHING BLUE was told from Darcy's point of view.  At first, I found it difficult to read a book from the point of view of a very unsympathetic character.  Darcy is not likable and hasn't matured/grown any since the events of SOMETHING BORROWED.  Her personality is like nails on a chalkboard.  She thinks world revolves around her.  In fact, she's upset that neither Rachel or Dex call to wish her a happy birthday after she told them she never wanted anything to do with either one of them again.  She also feels like she's one of the \\"chosen.\\"  In one passage, Darcy ponders, \\"I suddenly wondered what color eyes my baby would have.  I hoped for blue, or at least green like mine.  Everyone knows blue eyes are prettier, at least on a girl, which is why there are so many songs about brown-eyed girls, to make them feel better.\\"<br /><br />While I was pleased with the novel overall by the finale (I won't give anything more away), I was disappointed that neither Rachel nor Dex -- prominently featured in SOMETHING BORROWED -- barely made appearances in SOMETHING BLUE.  However, I appreciate that Giffin took a chance and wrote the novel from a different perspective than the original.  Kudos to her for that and for dispelling my belief that her novels were cheesy chick lit.  The characters are well-defined and not stereotypical.

B004Y1USJE|4.0|I have a soft spot for the Drama-era Yes since it was the first Yes album I bought \\"new\\" -- on the day it came out -- back in 1980. I'd discovered a little while before, after the release of \\"Going For the One\\" and, at that point, I had maybe 4 different albums with 4 different lineups. So for me, Drama wasn't a big departure. So here we have the Drama-era lineup (with Benoît David in place of Trevor Horn on vocals, with Horn at the console), with a side-long epic made up of Drama-era leftovers. Weirdly, this feels more like a Yes album to me than 90125, The Ladder, or  Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman & Howe. Not bad.

How the thread to the past is lost when each generation dies.<br /> This reminds of Primo Levi's 'Carbon' from 'The Periodic Table' in passages where Harding reflects on the return of all the base elements that are contained by each man back to the Earth we came from and therefore the Universe we're part of. Our immortality perhaps!<br /> An exceptional first novel and a book that comes from the high end of Pulitzer winners.
B004EPYZU8|4.0|Finally some babes with balls. My biggest complaint on most chick-driven action flicks is how unconvincing the gun-shooting and fighting sequences are. But not the case in \\"Sucker Punch\\" These women are as proficient in their use of weapons and tactics as Navy \\"S.e.a.l.s\\" Totally convincing! You will never look at your girlfriend or wife the same way again. And if one word sums up Zack's movies, it's COOL. What makes Zack's films so much better than the average action flick is his use of a virtual 3-D camera environment which totally immerses you in the experience, unlike most film-makers who are linear in their action. Just as in \\"Alien\\" you are never not quite sure of what you're looking at until the camera completes it's roll, pitch and yaw. The results are a movie audience that is totally glued to their seats and to the screen. I am totally surprized that other directors haven't copied his style already. Just as in the fighting sequences of 300, Zack smacks you in the face (SuckerPunches\\" you with the action and gritty realism. Visual imagery is astounding, music and sound effects plus the sighs and grunts of the female warriors composed into the score's background are dead on. Cast and costumes are sexy but totally functional. A well cast movie. Only wish there would have been an extended version of the 300 fight scenes. That movie always left me wanting more. Unfortunately he boxed himself in and never produced an extended version of the movie and left it no where to go. The only complaint on this movie is the ending. Didn't like it. And that the stepfather gets away with murder. Not a cool thing in my review of the movie. But other than that...WELL DONE ZACK. But again Zack why box yourself in. There is no where to go with a sequel in this universe. What if the audience wants to see more of \\"Babydoll\\" and her cool worlds and cool friends. Maybe Zack does not like sequels.

B003VGD340|5.0|The Tardis lands on present day Earth and the Doctor is thrown outside the Tardis leaving him stranded on Earth and Amy still inside. He tries to figure out what happend and he finds his answer in a small house occupied by a single man named Craig. The Doctor roomates with him and befriends Craig so he can save Amy and the world.    This is the cutest episode for this season. There were many funny moments watching the Doctor befriending Craig. The funniest is when he headbutts Craig twice so he can learn and understand everything about the Doctor in a few seconds. Matt Smith is at his funniest in this episode, his acting is great! I was laughing.

0385523912|5.0|This is a wonderfully written book. It is factual, eye opening, and touching all at once.  Barbara Demick did a wonderful job showing the lives of these ordinary North Korean citizens, the suffering and starvation and what they went through to leave. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the \\"real\\" life in North Korea, you will not be disappointed.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|As a sister of a brother with a head injury that caused permanent short term memory loss, this one hit home. Every day, every conversation is different. Glad I read it. Now I have nothing to read because I could not put it down and therefore tore through it rather quickly!
B0007939NO|1.0|It's always so sad to see what MGM did to the great stage musical \\"Brigadoon\\".  Despite the fact that it was not filmed on location, they do a decent job of filming with the painted backdrops.  Some scenes are actually beautiful.      Van Johnson is entertaining and does his role of Jeff quite well.  The man that plays Charlie (\\"Go Home with Bonnie Jean\\") does a stand out performance.      I've never been a fan of Gene Kelly.  Yes, he was a talented dancer, but his performances are marred by his huge ego and his films usually bore you to death with ongoing dance routines.  Example:  Singing in the Rain....the 15 minute \\"Broadway Melody\\"  what the heck did that do for the storyline?  Brigadoon is another prime example.  Beautiful songs from the original score were cut to make way for his \\"Look at Me\\" dance numbers.  The best song from the entire score \\"Come to Me, Bend to Me\\" was removed....shocking.  Add to that, Gene Kelly could not sing.  He sounds more like he's hacking up phlegm.                                                       I like Cyd Charrisse, but again, she should not have been cast as Fiona.  Her voice was dubbed by a woman that could not even hit the high notes required.  What I found most comical, was the makeup for the Character \\"Sandy the candyman\\"  looking like he's out of a \\"Lucky Charms\\" commercial.   Hollywood likes to remake old films.  I really wish they would redo Brigadoon the correct way, so we would have a decent rendition of a this great Broadway Musical.

0061928356|5.0|A full 5 stars from me and congratulations to the author Shilpi Somaya Gowda. I loved the comment by Mary Jane Clark (New York Times bestselling author) on the front cover as it perfectly summarizes my opinion: \\"It's moving and thought-provoking and informative and imaginative and beautifully executed. What a wonderful story!\\". It is indeed.     India, rural village, 1984. Kavita delivers a lovely daughter but she knows she is not expected to keep her as the whole family, especially her husband, want a boy. So in order to save the baby's life, she is forced to give her up. She will never forget her though, and this decision will forever haunt her. USA, 1984. Somer and husband Krishnan, both medical doctors, decide to adopt an Indian baby after several struggles and failures to have their own a baby. They both fall in love with the photo of the baby girl they are supposed to adopt and set out for the long journey to India to get to her.     The story is told by different perspectives and characters (in third person) in alternating chapters and it ends in almost-present day. It is a remarkable journey through two different cultures (Indian and American) and that baby girl is the indisputable connection to all protagonists. As she grows up, she questions her identity and things start to get more difficult for her adoptive parents.     When narrating about the Indian side of the family -Krishnan the adoptive father was born and raised in Mumbai, then moved to the USA due to his medical studies- the book reminds me of another one I read not too long ago, \\"The Pleasure Seekers\\" by Tishani Doshi (which I also reviewed and recommend, although the main subject there is totally different). What I mean to say is, this new book, just like The Pleasure Seekers, made me feel curious about a culture I do not know enough about and would like to.     Other themes explored here are infertility, motherhood, fatherhood, loss and emptiness caused by many different factors. And love, above all.   I do not want to spoil the story by saying any more. It has to be read and savoured as it unfolds page after page. Lovely, lovely, lovely. With substance.

OTHERWISE, the book is completely useless.      The first chapter explains, basically, that you need to focus on what you're good at.  The access code gives you the ability to take an online test that tells you what you're good at.  The rest of the book is a list of 34 things that people are good at.  You need to take the test to know which of the 34 sections are important.  So, do NOT buy USED books if the ACCESS Code is USED!

B003UYV08E|4.0|I must confess I wasn't permitted to read super hero comics as a child, so I don't have the enthusiasm for Marvel, Stan Lee, and other related genre products that many of my friends do. I enjoyed the special effects of Spiderman (the recent big budget film), but the storyline was lacking. The Hulk movie didn't do it for me. But a friend urged me to check out the first Iron Man movie as he assured me Robert Downey, Jr. takes it levels above the typical super hero/comic-based films. And he was right. There are, as should be expected, moments that definitely require a suspension of belief, but I didn't mind them. I'm a published author of horror, sci-fi and fantasy, so I tend to look to the storyline and the characters above the impressive special effects. Both of the Iron Man films are enjoyable on all of these levels. The first one is my favorite, although it is difficult to state why that's the case, but this second film is quite enjoyable as well. I can assure you I'm looking forward to a third in the series; my only requirement is that Downey remain the lead in any further films as he adds something special to the role.

B000095IUM|4.0|Paradoxically, Nikolaus Harnoncourt manages to bring forth a typically idiosyncratic reading of Beethoven's symphonies without sounding extreme in any direction.  These 1990 recordings were based on extensive research and knowledge of historically informed practice (HIP), no surprise given his expertise in the baroque and classical repertoire as well as his intellectual approach (see for instance the added disc to his [[ASIN:B0000AF1IG Bruckner 9th]] exploring a reconstruction of the incomplete fourth movement.)<br /><br />Though the Chamber Orchestra of Europe uses HIP techniques such as minimized vibrato, it plays modern instruments, and while Harnoncourt's readings can be quirky and/or revelatory in many passages, the timings are not lightning-fast as with some HIP performances.  In general this is a very sober traversal which makes me wonder why it caused such a brouhaha on its release.  I am glad to have added it to my collection because Harnoncourt's take is *interesting,* not because Harnoncourt's take is overall the best Beethoven.  His Third and Fifth are standouts, while the 9th is dull.  This cycle is certainly not replacing my [[ASIN:B00076YOPY Barenboim]] or [[ASIN:B00005QHV5 Wand]] sets, let alone [[ASIN:B00001W09Z Furtwangler]].<br /><br />I do find it interesting that Harnoncourt, who is Austrian, stayed away from Beethoven for a long time.  He had what he called a \\"Beethoven-Problem,\\" a \\"deep inner resistance\\" to performing Beethoven that persisted into the 1980s because of how he had seen the music misused in his youth, its elements of \\"the will to conquer and the demand for power\\" utilized to manipulate the masses (from Monika Mertl's liner notes).  Apparently Harnoncourt finally came to hear Beethoven differently via Schubert, and worked backward from Schubert's apprecation of and reaction to Beethoven to finally reach his own.  He had to consciously \\"purge his interpretation of all that is unthinkingly heroic.\\"<br /><br />This set of 5 discs in a cumbersome fold-out jewel box (my fold-out came loose, but it still sits in the case) is not as elegant as a Brilliant-style box, but it does include a 120-page booklet with 30 pages of commentary in English, including an interview with Harnoncourt.<br /><br />(verified purchase from Amazon.co.uk)ewel box (my fold-out came loose, but it still sits in the case) is not as elegant as a Brilliant-style box, but it does include a 120-page booklet with 30 pages of commentary in English, including an interview with Harnoncourt.

B0058VW36U|4.0|From the reviews, I expected to love this the way I love Angry Birds, but so far I don't. Maybe it's because I have higher standards for a paid app, even $0.99. This game could easily have an AdMob bar and be free and I would have given it 5 stars for value.  Edit: I upped my rating because the vendor is continuing to come out with new puzzles. I think 'Where's my Water?' is a more fun game, even if this is more challenging.
0345529057|5.0|I loved it. After having watched the television series, it was great to get even more insight into the characters and story. (The casting for the series was superb as I never once had trouble melding the actors to the characters in the book.) I look forward to reading book 2, 3, and 4!
B0018LX9T4|5.0|It's too bad that Amazon allows ratings only up to 5 stars. I would give \\"Secretary\\" at least 7 stars. It has easily become my all-time favorite movie.     The principal characters are Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and E. Edward Grey (James Spader).  Lee is a young woman who cuts herself when stressed.  Mr. Grey is her employer, an obsessive-compulsive, with a seemingly mean streak which masks his attraction to Lee.  As the plot unfolds their relationship evolves, to put it mildly.    The theme of Secretary is dominance/submission, and there are scenes of spanking, self-stimulation, and some nudity. Fair warning to any yahoos out there who think that women should be kept barefoot and pregnant, and slapped around: you'll find this movie disappointing  -- spend your money on a six-pack instead.     Fair advice also to any feminists out there who might pre-judge that \\"Secretary\\" serves only to gratify the aforementioned yahoos: I would urge you to see this movie and judge for yourself. You'll need to keep an open mind as you watch, but if you can suspend judgment you may see a beautiful love story about two wounded people finding one another.     I won't say much here about the plot, which I found highly erotic despite the often light-hearted tone of the movie. The most intensely erotic scene, for me, was the one labeled \\"Insight\\" on the scene selection menu. Erotic? Lee and Mr. Grey merely talk, they keep their clothes on, and don't even touch one another, although they sit just a bit too close and make a bit too much eye contact. The essential action of this scene is that Mr. Grey, having discovered that Lee cuts herself when stressed, persuades her to stop. Well, actually, he commands her to stop. Lee's emotions flash through timidity, apprehension, eagerness, shyness, subtle flirtatiousness, self-deprecating humor, acquiescence, insight, resoluteness, and growing respect for both herself and Mr. Grey. The sexual tension in this scene is palpable, and when it ends one senses that the fireworks are about to begin. Ms. Gyllenhaal's performance here (and indeed through the entire movie) is pitch-perfect. She manages to convey Lee's feelings with subtleties of voice, eyes, mouth, hands, head tilt, posture, breathing, the lump in her throat, you name it. Gyllenhaal effortlessly manages to look comedic, optimistic in spite of her problem, cute, or drop-dead gorgeous, whatever the moment calls for. It's magic; in my opinion, the only other actress who comes close to Gyllenhaal's skills is Helen Mirren.     James Spader, whose role calls for great subtlety, is also perfect as Mr. Grey, as are the entire cast of supporting characters. Kudos also to Steven Shainberg for his vision and courage to create this film, and to Erin Cressida Wilson for the screen play adaptation of a short story by Mary Gaitskill. Although I don't usually pay attention to production details, I was greatly impressed by the camera work and editing. I also thought the music, especially the song \\"Chariots Rise\\" by Lizzie West, was great.     But it's Gyllenhaal who really owns this movie. After seeing Secretary, I wondered if perhaps she was a \\"one-trick pony,\\" that is, great at playing only one particular type of character. So, I bought another feature film of hers, \\"Sherrybaby,\\" in which she plays Sherry Swanson, a vulnerable but hard-bitten ex-con heroin addict with a quick temper and a habit of using sex to buy favors. Sherrybaby is a pretty gritty movie, but well worth seeing, and I would urge others to buy or rent it. If one didn't notice a facial resemblance, one might not realize that the same actress played both Lee Holloway and Sherry Swanson. Several professional critics opined that she deserved an Oscar nomination for that role.  Laughably, Gyllenhaal did finally get an Oscar nomination for her supporting role in Crazy Heart; she was of course very good in that movie, but her role simply didn't require great acting skills. Maybe some day Gyllenhaal will get the recognition she deserves.     One final note about the theme of Secretary: At least one other reviewer here commented that, although it was plausible for Lee Holloway to become a submissive, there was no explanation of why Mr. Grey became a dominant. I was also bothered by this at first, but then I concluded that because this movie was told from Lee's viewpoint, any background about Mr. Grey would have been a distraction. At first Mr. Grey seems like a domineering jerk, but as the movie unfolds we slowly discover that he, like Lee, is also a profoundly troubled soul. His empathy for Lee (albeit well disguised!) suggests that beneath his bluster he is also a submissive at heart, and that he gets satisfaction vicariously from his role as a dominant. This makes some sense, in accordance with the notion that in a successful dominant/submissive relationship, it is the submissive who is really in charge. I would refer you to the very final scene in Secretary.

B003YL4LYI|3.0|See title of review.  The maps on my kindle version are worse than useless, as it is impossible to read them (even when zoomed in); they're just too faint to be able to see the writing.  And 40% of them are missing altogether (there should be 5 but the maps of the North and South of Westeros are nowhere to be seen).<br /><br />I would have given this A 4/5 otherwise since I consult the maps frequently while reading this series, and had to download them as a separate pdf off the net.  I didn't enjoy the book itself quite as much as volumes 1-3 - more comparable to book 4, A Feast For Crows, which took longer to grow on me as I expect this one will.  Like AFFC, it takes a little more work than vol's 1-3 to fully appreciate.  There are some great \\"easter eggs\\" for those who have read the Dunk & Egg tales and/or are just Westerosi history buffs in general.

B005D9MUWY|1.0|Upon downloading TouchType's SwiftKey X, I was prompted with its license agreement, which specifically states that I may only use the software \\"on a single computational device for your own personal or internal business purposes\\". I have have multiple Android devices, including a 7\\" Gingerbread tablet. I may also purchase other Android devices in the future. Although Amazon's App Store allows you to install software on multiple devices, this EULA does not. You can install it only on one phone, and then only for \\"personal\\" or \\"internal business\\" purposes (whatever that means).    The EULA goes on to read that I agree to \\"effect and maintain adequate security measures to safeguard the Software from theft or access by any person other than those permitted in this license.\\" Nowhere does the license explain what \\"adequate security measures\\" are, but at a minimum I assume using a lockscreen would be required. Additionally, the license makes it clear that the agreement is between only myself and TouchType, so under the terms of the license, no one else could ever use my phone, for any purpose, ever.    I'd like to start using SwiftKey X, but its license goes too far. I may, for example, want to install a keyboard I like on both of my Android devices. I may also want to let a friend use my Android phone to make a call when he doesn't have service. And what if I want to use my phone without whatever security measures TouchType deems \\"adequate\\"? Why am I responsible for their security? Regrettably, the egregious and patently anti-consumer terms of TouchType's EULA make it impossible for me to even evaluate its product.
B004LWZW24|1.0|The only thing insidious about this film is the nearly constant screaming and bawling of the infant in the film. It's bad enough to have to put up with bad behavior from moviegoers without having to suffer through the same annoyances on the screen. A lot of reviews trumpet the first half of the film... I guess compared to the second half, folks are trying to be generous in looking for something to put a positive spin on. Not even worth straight-to-bargain-bin prices.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|A good application so far, but the themes seems a little flat, and there is No ARABIC!!!!!  But overall, I will keep using it and will be waiting for further updates

B002KAJ0AO|5.0|I have been a fan of BSB for years.  This CD definitely brings their music into the \\"now\\".  I absolutely love every song on it.  Usually CD's at least have one or two songs I have to skip, but this NONE.  This CD is very upbeat and danceable.  I love BSB's ballads but this is definitely a good workout CD!  My absolute favorite song on the CD is \\"Undone\\".  I like it when BSB throws some R&B into their music because they are such good singers and are very talented at harmonizing.  Definitely a good buy for BSB fans and those just getting into BSB as well!!

0439023491|5.0|These books really keep you guessing, right until the end. The last book in the series is no different.  I really enjoyed all three of these books. Everytime you think you know for sure what will happen next, it doesn't. I really loved all three books, the only issue I had was reading them too fast.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I'm apart of the swype beta, but i choose this keyboard or swype easily. With swype I always need to fix multiple words in my messages. This is much more accurate :)
B004I8WD6E|3.0|This is a perfectly functional little protective case for your iPhone, though not as gnarly as some out there.  I don't really see why you'd buy a clear case - your case is really the only way you can personalize your iPhone, with pretty colors or sparkles or nike swooshes or whatever - but if that's your thing, then go for it.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Besides Swype, SwiftKey X is one of my favorite keyboards. I tend to use it more than any other. It gets better the more you use it as it learns how you type
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I just downloaded it today on  my Android. I'm very impressive. I love the fact that its very customizable, love the Neon keyboard, though it wish I could customized it more with my own colors and themes. It's pretty accurate in predicting my words and autocorrection. Probably one of the better keyboards I used. The fact that it doesn't have many language packages is a downside. Mainly includes European countries and the Americas, what about asia?? It sucks that I have to switch between this keyboard and my korean keyboard just to type in Korean. Hopefully, SwiftkeyX will include Korean as one of the language.     But overall, enable \\"learning\\" from FB, gmail, etc really helps in predicting your words. Great App (minus the missing Korean language package)!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I purchased Swiftkey awhile back and got the free upgrade to Swiftkey X when it became available.  I've tried several Android soft keyboards and this is by far the best in my opinion.

I'm certainly not the fastest when typing on the touchscreen but this app helps a lot with it's predictive word suggestions.

When I started out, I didn't have a clue about all the things that an Indie author has to get involved in. It's not just a question of writing a fab book - that's the easy part! The hard bit is what comes next...<br /><br />I didn't have a clue where to find covers, good editors, how to market effectively and gain lovely readers and fans. PRC, MOBI, Epub sounded more like a scratchy disease than anything to do with e-pubbing.

B003V1YHFE|1.0|There are many good things one can say about these movies, but ultimately, this package comes up short on content compared to the DVDs. Scenes that are a part of the Director's Cut DVDs are excluded from the blu ray disks, and are instead available as \\"Extras\\". If you know the DVDs, this can be jarring.    Based on run times posted on the DVD cover and the run time for the collection posted here, there appear to be about 7 minutes of content missing across the 4 disks. As such, I can't give this collection more than one star.     Caveat emptor!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is by far the best keyboard out there. I've been using SwiftKey since its beginning and it keeps getting better and better. Well worth the $4!
B001DF68MA|5.0|seat worked great! like a 5-point harness seat for a baby. and the pad in front work great for the baby's head when she falls asleep, wants to hold on to something, or just pound her fists. the feet stands are adjustable to fit your baby's height, seat straps are adjustable, seats are coshioned, soft, and sturdy. A lot better then the rear seats because you can see you baby, and she can look up and see you, better than the hander bar seats because this seat is centers out the baby's weight. i though i'd have a problem riding with the seat between my legs, but in fact, its really comfortable, and does not cause a problem when i ride. the seat comes off easily. I really enjoy using this seat, and my baby loves going for bike rides. turns a lot of heads, i've been asked about it many of times.
030746363X|5.0|This book was great!  Tons of tips and guides for living a healthy life without spending all your time in the gym or the kitchen.  Simple to read and kept my attention pretty much throughout.    Not sure I agree with everything 100% in this book, but that's okay.  Definitely got a lot of good pointers that few other books will actually tell you.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I was actually about to pay for this on the android market. so glad that it's free today, and but even otherwise, for it's still worth the price! it even spell checks my physical keyboard and often figures out what word I'm going to type next! if you don't like the look you can change it to &quot;light&quot; to give you a more standard feel.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Great little keyboard.  I've used the native as well as Gingerbread...I like this one best.  I never use Swype, so it doesn't bother me that it's not a part of this app.  The settings are vast and useful allowing the user to make it do exactly what they need.  I am a \\"Precise\\" typer, rather than fast.  Handy that it can be set for people like me.<br /><br />To people with download issues:  It's free today, so likely the network is taking a beating.  If you just keep retrying, it works.  It took about five retries for me to get the download.<br /><br />I'm not sure why some people are saying that it doesn't capitalize after the beginning of a new sentence.  It does it for me.  I even tried not spacing between sentences and it still works.  Perhaps it has to do with the way I configured it.
B004XJHBCE|3.0|Would like to see options for 2 widgets that are all the odd sizes to cram more stuff.  A 1x2, or a full row and half of the next?  Maybe the ability to detect items in label and suggest shape?  I find there is more wasted real estate when I use this app
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've used all of the SwiftKey products as they've progressed to this point and I've loved them all.  I've tried other keyboards, but this is the one for me.  It can learn from your texts, tweets or fb status posts (all optional) to help with predictions.  I know every one is different, and some prefer other apps of this type, but it's worth giving this one a try to see if it works for you.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|One of the best and convenient Apps an android can have, especially when it's a free download. A must have app!!!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|All of the negative ratings for this app are because people are having trouble downloading the language pack.  It's an amazing app for anyone who has it and because it's free on Amazon today, everyone is trying to download it at once.  I'm sure the data connection issue is just on their end and they're having trouble keeping up with the demand.  If it fails, just try again.  You'll get it eventually, and it's worth it.  Even at it's normal selling price.
B000G73UEU|5.0|The Leonard Cohen movie soundtrack is a brilliant tribute to the music of Cohen by various very talented artists.  I don't think I will ever tire of listening to this CD. Highly recommended.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|There are numerous other keyboard apps out there, and some are quite competent.  Swiftkey X, however, has performed the best on my phone (Moto XT720 w/Froyo 2.2.1).  It has the best word suggestion engine, and also has features (the arrow keys, most notably) that I've been looking for.    I had used the beta, and purchased the official release as soon as it came out.  I purchased it for a reduced rate on the Android Market for $1.99, though I would have paid full price for it if I had to.  Today, I was flabbergasted to see that it is the free \\"paid\\" app of the day on Amazon (July 21, 2011).  I had gotten it from here as well, and I would recommend that you do too while the getting's good.    If you miss this opportunity, then think about how important the keyboard is to you, and also what features that you desire in a keyboard.  You may find that Swiftkey X may be what you're looking for, and is worth the price.
B001QL5MAA|3.0|I'm reading this now....this is a very slow read for me for some reason. I think it is the writing style. At half way through it is getting interesting now.    The Kindle edition has many, many, many errors - spelling, punctuation, formatting.    If a company wants to set a top dollar paper book price for an electronic edition, they can at least do a professional job at editing the edition. The poor editing looks low brow and unprofessional.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|This changed my world. Took a bit to figure out how to get it to do what I wanted it to do, but I love that everything can be customized. Love it!
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Honestly I don't think there is anything more that I can say that hasn't already been said in the some 400+ reviews on this series.<br /><br />I initially requested the product on Vine, hoping that it would be something my husband and I could watch together. He couldn't be patient enough to wait on me to watch it though! And he hasn't stopped watching since! I've only been able to watch a few episodes, but it's great!<br /><br />Hopefully one of these days I hope to be able to watch it and catch up on all the other seasons.
B004GUSG4M|2.0|It kept my attention for a while.  Interesting premise.  Then it fell completely apart.  A waste of my time and my money.  Have NO idea why it's getting such great reviews.
1416549447|4.0|Good, common sense tips here regarding proper, low-impact running technique. The book advises the runner on mental focus and steers readers toward proper posture, foot placement and positioning. The basis of the book is similar to Romanov's Pose Method, also useful for reducing wear and tear.     Pain in my hamstrings, knees and calves seems to be reduced using the tips found in Chi Running. Nothing earth-shattering, but worth the price for the frequent runner.
B004EPYZUI|1.0|I think this is quite possibly the worst movie I've seen in 5 years. The \\"storyline\\" rips off parts of 4 or 5 other movies (maybe more I didn't catch) and the girls walking around all bas ass comes off as a Saturday Night Live skit. Some of the battles were cool, but even then every time the girls fall from any height they have to land all dramatic like on one knee with their head bent to the ground, which is ripped from the naked Arnie parts of the Terminator movies. A movie for hipsters.
0545259088|4.0|Forever is the final book in the Mercy Falls trilogy, and it's just as gripping and filled with emotion as the first two, Shiver and Linger. Beginning a few months after Grace has shifted into a wolf, we find Sam and Isabel waiting for her return as the weather warms, and Cole still intent on discovering a cure. Meanwhile, suspicion has turned on Sam due to Grace's disappearance, and Isabel's father is determined to rid Boundary Woods of all wolves, no matter the cost. When he gets lawmakers on his side, Isabel knows time is running out and she has to do something.<br /><br />I love Cole St. Clair. I just had to say that. He is comic relief, determination, arrogance, and romance all rolled into one character, and while his story is secondary, he's actually the one I felt closest to throughout Forever. I loved the banter between he and Isabel, and the scene in her mother's clinic is perfect. Don't get me wrong, I love Sam as well, but Cole...he's the most three dimensional figure in the series.<br /><br />Forever runs mostly on emotion, with the love and longing of Grace and Sam taking center stage. I love how these two work together and I swear I could feel the longing between the two when Grace kept shifting. Both characters have a lot of childhood issues to deal with in Forever, and things don't always work out as planned. It's during those times that both Isabel and Rachel shine; I would want both of these girls on my side in a crisis.<br /><br />Possible spoiler...While I loved Forever, and feel it's a strong finale, I am disappointed in the ultimate ending. For the last of a trilogy, it's just too open-ended. I can imagine what I hope will happen, and the title of the book gives me a clue that perhaps I'm right. But to leave things unsettled really bothers me, to the point that I took a star off my final review. I felt as though, rather than making a statement, the ending was almost a cop out; perhaps the author had originally intended for either Grace or Sam to die and then just couldn't do it herself so she left the possibility? And if she wanted them to live, why not just extend the book a bit more or add an epilogue? It just doesn't make sense in a series that has been carefully plotted and developed so well up to that point.  Don't get me wrong, I loved Forever and will recommend this series to others. I just will always wish the author hadn't left it up to me to decide the ultimate fates of two people I'd grown very close to over the course of three books. One way or the other, I needed more closure than was provided, and that mars my overall enjoyment (slightly) of this book.uldn't do it herself so she left the possibility?

B004GYY714|5.0|Went to Nashville in June, the one hip hop station they had really SUCKED, thanks to TuneIn Radio(I have the pro version, thanks for making it free Amazon) I was able to listen to the hip hop stations out of Atlanta and Memphis which helped me not be bored and it helped me keep my sanity as I traveled I-24.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|I bought the original SwiftKey keyboard in the Android Market and they gave us the free upgrade to SwiftKey X and I seriously doubt that I'll use any other keyboard, if you want to swype that's your business, if you want to use that reptile sounding T9 that's your business but SwiftKey is for me.

B0011FDVKE|5.0|Those who catch only the first tune of \\"Another Country\\" -- an album that explores the sometimes rocky territory of love -- might think that the album is just that -- all country music.  An upbeat, uptempo country song that, lyrically, delves into the depths of sorrow, but not regret, that one can feel at the end of an affair. A steady drumbeat leads listeners into \\"Broken\\", a tune about the bewilderment and numbness one feels when recovering from a broken heart. And the last words -- \\"Again and again, I think I will break but I mend\\" -- go to the heart of what makes Merrit a five star writer: she doesn't get maudlin.  She acknowledges pain and heartbreak and even death, and then insists that we (and she) pick ourselves back up by the bootstraps and keep on keepin' on.  Even so, \\"Another Country\\", piano-driven ballad, may be the most _wistful_ paean to the idea of love ever penned.  Always on the outside looking in, never quite finding the right door, the right key, the singer remains hopeful that one day she, too, might visit, and one day live in, that other country. \\"Hopes Too High\\" is pop-country tune that features a Springstee-eque harmonica solo and skirts the edges of hopelessness, refusing to give in to darkness.  A reviewer who covered this album when it came out, marveled at how Merrit sounds like Diana Ross in some of her vocals for \\"Morning is My Destination\\", a funky, souful tune in which a woman pleads for a night of passion (something to get her through the night) with her lover.  There are some definite similarities, but it's all Merrit when the bluesy pleading begins. \\"Keep You Happy\\" is an uptempo folk-country song.  Pop/country melodies carry the tune of \\"I Know What I'm Looking For Now\\", with just a hint of gospel (organ-driven) uplift in the chorus of this song about a woman who has lived through wrong-headed affairs and come out with a stronger heart and even more determination to find love. And \\"Tell Me Something True\\" is the album's actual Motown-style piece, with hand-clapping a singing-style that _does_ sound as if Meritt is channeling Diana Ross, and well-placed (stax-style) horn sections.  This tune is every bit as danceable and memoralbe as \\"Good Hearted Man\\" (from the \\"Tambourine\\" album), and the only reason it didn't become a follow-up hit is because no one knows how to properly market these days.  \\"My Heart is Free\\" begins with an acoustic guitar strum, followed by a Hendrix-hazy electric guitar lick.  It's the ultimate, I-own-my-heart, song, and features truly solid writing and playing (guitars, especially), but... it doesn't quite fit in (in my estimation) with the thematic flow of the rest of the album. Which makes it the only stumble in this album, and, in fact, any of Merrit's last three albums (but it's minor enough to not lose the five star rating).  A slow, lazy, sweet waltz, \\"Tender Branch\\" is lovely song, both in tune and in lyric, about learning to _not_ tilt at windmills for the whole of one's life.  And it (along with \\"Another Country\\") heralds Merrit's move from promising and talented songwriter to lyric poet.  It (and the title song) is that good.  To round things out, Merrit (who spent a year in Paris before this album was recorded), sings a cover version of a poetic, pop French song, \\"Mille Tendresses\\" (which translated means, 1000 Tendernesses).  Merrit does an excellent job of (fluently) singing the tune. It was written by Tran Perry and, any of its verses and chorus would be worth quoting, but the last verse/chorus drives home the album's theme:<br />\\"And if we lose each other one evening of the fall,<br />Flying on the air like th lyric of this song,<br />Never forget that I will find you again,<br />In 1000 tendernesses, in each tenderness I find.\\"<br /><br />\\"Another Country\\" is a beautiful, musical and lyrical exploration of that land wherein we all want to spend the rest of our days (and nights) -- the country of love.own-style piece, with hand-clapping a singing-style that _does_ sound as if Meritt is channeling Diana Ross, and well-placed (stax-style) horn sections.

0307387178|5.0|Krakauer is such a talented and engaging writer is it hard to put this book down.  The stories he tells can be so heart wrenching and sad but they don't make you feel terrible.  You realize that the people he writes about are doing what they love.
0375842209|5.0|Was delighted to read a tragedy with so much human connection.  You really connect with Liesel, you cheer for her for the whole way through, no matter if she's plotting trouble or remedy.
0385341008|5.0|The entire book is written in letter form and moves very quickly.  At times this can be annoying when you want to hear more from one character or another but the authors always get back around to them. It was very hard to put this down.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I had been getting more and more frustrated with the swype keyboard recently and this came at the perfect time. predictions are very good! Easy to use. Got it as the free app of the most day, and but worth paying for it!

B001HNE3NO|5.0|I purchased this after seeing an interview on TV with the author.  The subject matter intrigued me.   It's a wonderful story of different people in different times, connected by tragic circumstances.  I was surprised at how well written it was.  An excellent book!!!  I usually get bored with too much detail about the characters and was shocked at the writer's ability to keep my interest in every little detail.  I did not know about the French involvement in the atrocious herding of Jews so that could be sent to their deaths.  The book provided insight on the impact of these actions on generations of families which are forever linked.   This is one of the best books I have ever read.
B004EPYZUI|3.0|I think this movie may not have been possible to make without 'Inception' being released first. A number of story elements have been taken from that film. One thing that is interesting and I don't know whether it has come out of the interest in trying to explain 'Inception', is that people are now trying to explain this film.    This could be a deliberate ploy of writing a story like that - hoping it will be interpreted as having different levels and that moviegoers are both ready for and want that.    A few other things can be true:  One - the film isn't that interesting and doesn't work at all, apart from the action scenes.  Two - the film is very simple to understand and people are trying to make it seem like there was more going on by being intellectual about it.  Three - it's just entertainment and none of the above matters anyway.     The film was made for Blu-Ray, there is no doubt of that. The visuals and production design are something else entirely.  However, I will agree that it is depressing and disturbing once you begin to put together what may not have been happening on screen to the main character, who is apparently a dancer (though we do not see this on screen). I did notice that Doctor Gorski (the mental health professional) looks very sad after the main character's 'dance' performances - this is not out of admiration for what we do not see, but rather seems to be because she knows what the dance REALLY represents. This may be because she is powerless to stop what is going on.    The film could be about empowerment or loss/lack of power.    I think for many the film was either a downer, was seen as sexist , had a confused plot and/or thought it was smarter than it was. Regardless, a lot of people didn't connect with it. It may have another life on home video. I will be interested to see how it is regarded in ten years. I would recommend renting it at least.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|The best keyboard for Android, hands down. The predictions are spot-on and the layout is great. I paid for my copy and don't regret it.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I do like this keyboard but wish I could use the swype method with it.. that's the only thing it's lacking.. otherwise, for great app and perfect since it's free..
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've tried out a bunch of different keyboards, with multiple ROMs on my HTC Droid Incredible.  The only two I actually like using are the HTC IME, and SwiftKey X.  I bought SwiftKey X last week from the Android Market when they had it half price.  Regretting that a tiny bit now that it turns up free here today.  But I don't regret the app, it's fantastic.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This keyboard is still simply amazing. I am able to type much faster than the stock gingerbread keyboard and the text prediction is mindboggling.  It can search through your email/facebook and sms messages to learn how you type. I'd pay for this had I not gotten it when it was free.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|OK, so I devoured this trilogy much like everyone else who read it.<br />It was very well-paced which allowed the reader to become rapidly hooked if not engrossed.<br />As I write this review I realize that I am writing to the whole trilogy with a focus on the last, but I feel that these books are so interconnected it is hard to separate them.<br />I truly believe that the trilogy was one book and broken into three for whatever reasons as truly one needed to read all three to have any sense of closure.  The first led right into the second which led right into the last.<br />If you are starting with this book and have not read the first...STOP.  Go back and read the first two prior to reading this one.<br />Again, I liken these books in their dystopia and overall theme to \\"The Lord of The Flies\\" and \\"The Running Man.\\"  Some liken it to \\"Battle Royale\\" which I have not read yet though I have read Koushun Takami's statements noting his own book as being derivative of \\"The Lord of The Flies\\" and \\"The Running Man\\" so I am probably not too far off base.<br />While this book did grab me and suck me in from beginning to end it lacked a certain amount of soul.  The whole series did.<br />I am still hungry for more description, more grit evoking a more visceral response.<br />Again, I note here, Collins is no wordsmith.<br />She spins a good tale, but it is somewhat devoid of emotional content and while I enjoyed the thrill-ride I could not feel the characters.  Our protagonist, Katniss for the most part, is inaccessible to the reader.  Yes, I know, she is guarded and has a hard time getting in touch with her own emotions, but we as the readers are hard-pressed to empathize as this part of her plight is sparsely described.<br />I still do not have a feel for the areas in which the story took place.  No vivid descriptions to make me feel the heat or the cold.  No words to describe the sting of the salt, the blue of the water or the lush fronds of the trees.<br />With no solid character or environmental development I had nowhere to set my heart (well, sometimes with Peeta, but that gets lost too).<br />Also, we wander through various disconnected genres (cyberpunk, urban, steampunk, and other) that feel disjointed and awkward.<br /><br />That is a shame because the story was riveting.<br /><br />No, I am not contradicting myself here.<br />The tale had been told before.  The writing was on the wall and as I noted in my reviews of the early books, the reader, if paying attention, should know exactly where the book is going and see most of the major plot twists and turns by the time you have reached 25% of book #1, \\"The Hunger Games.\\"<br />So, if that predictable how come three-stars?<br />In the story itself.<br />Initially I attributed my being rapt to the telling, but it was the actual story that had me engrossed.<br />Where I wish it had been fleshed out on many levels from emotional to contextual to environmental to political...I still loved the story.  I was still invested and wanted to see it through to the end.<br /><br />There are those of you that feel that this was the worst of the three books.<br />I truly believe that as a piece of literature it was the best.<br />Collins found more of her voice here, took more chances, took more time to develop characters, relationships and environments and while I wish she was able to take some of the concepts further she brought it home and left me in a place that was perfect to end this series.<br />Those who are looking for straight up action will find themselves liking \\"The Hunger Games\\" best.<br />Those who appreciate an author seeing her vision through and spreading her wings (as it were...no pun intended) will find themselves more thoroughly satisfied with \\"Mockingjay.\\"<br />A great ending to a very good trilogy.<br /><br />Namaste~had nowhere to set my heart (well, sometimes with Peeta, but that gets lost too).

B004SBQAN8|4.0|WOW!!!! Just watched this movie from a reccommendation from my 13 yr old daughter..... was a bit hesitate as the reviews were not that good.... it was raining outside and had a spare 2 hrs for a change to watch it!!!!!Well I was very surprised. From the beginning to end, I was on the edge of my seat....Great script writing and a great story.I was also impressed with the boy meets girl script... not corny... but well done.I even managed to have a few tears.... but happy tears.... A great watch on a rainy afternoon..... A great 2 hrs to forget about real life ...
B003UESJH4|5.0|\\"The King's Speech\\" is a wonderful anomaly!<br /><br />I had a friend recommend it when it first came out. I'm very wary of friends' recommendations because the majority of people are content with the pablum that constitutes most movies these days. But I took my wife to see it in the theater (we watch very few in the theaters) and then again with my 2 oldest children last night!<br /><br />Wow! On so many levels: \\"Wow!\\"<br /><br />First, there is the authenticity. The fact that this is based on history and in history adds extra texture and depth to the film that most films simply can't achieve.<br /><br />Second, George VI (before he was King) manifested an incredibly persistent courage, in spite of his baggage growing up, the gravity and importance of his life, and the disability of his stuttering. This is a very autobiographical issue for me (not stuttering but introversion and other issues) and a wonderful example for my children.<br /><br />Third, the acting is spot on, especially in both the King (Colin Firth) and the speech coach's (Geoffrey Rush) characters. The character of the King-to-be's speech coach is not only humorous but is also a great example of the power and confidence that comes from having mastered one's field.<br /><br />Fourth, the development of the relationship between the Prince and Lionel Logue (the speech coach) is a joy to watch as it unfolds. There are many details that make it an authentic telling of the unfolding of an unusual and instructive relationship. It was also a revelation, watching the second time, that both of the admirable men in the movie, the Prince and his coach, had loving, supportive, wise wives standing beside them (as opposed to Wallis Simpson in relation to Prince Edward (who looks like a complete fool in the movie.)<br /><br />It's ironic that this movie received an R rating for language. Technically, it deserves the R rating, for it drops the F bomb as much as just about any movie. However, it's the one movie I've seen where the use of profanity was actually required by the script and circumstances. The contrast between the exalted station of the Prince and his use of expletives also made the scenes where he used profanity very funny.<br /><br />I've been watching classic films (\\"The King's Speech\\" has all the markings of a classic) with my older kids. One of the things I've pointed out, in watching the original \\"Lord of the Flies,\\" \\"The Killing Fields,\\" and now \\"The King's Speech\\" is that they should notice that great movies don't need a noisy and noisome soundtrack to keep you interested or to tell you how to feel. Great movies can take their time, trusting the story, characters, and actors to tell a truth worth telling.<br /><br />If you haven't yet seen it, \\"The King's Speech\\" is most definitely, on many levels, a movie worth watchingby the script and circumstances.

B004WKOCP8|4.0|For those of you that have grown up with Incubus like myself since way back in 1997 with S.C.I.E.N.C.E. you will appreciate how the band has grown.  However I still want Incubus to rock out every once and while, the new album is lacking that, but if you like the smooth sounds and melodies that only Incubus can bring you won't be disappointed.  This Album is all about chill, nothing really to rock out to, but it is all about smooth notes and BB's voice and lyrics you won't be disappointed.  Catchy beats with that familiar voice will have you on cruise control.  A must for fans, for newer listeners I would recommend \\"Make Yourself\\" and \\"Morning View\\" first.  Add this once you appreciate the music of Incubus.

B0027YUK98|5.0|Isabelle Faust continues to rise in my estimation, every time I hear a recording of hers for the first time.  Starting with her survey of the Bart&oacute;k sonatas, and continuing with her spectacular move into solo Bach, her interpretations made me look past the somewhat inflated prices (and REALLY junky packaging) of Harmonia Mundi, and seek out her other recordings with an enthusiasm that I don't often have for contemporary violinists.<br /><br />And here we have a collection which has already aroused some debate, just among a handful of Amazon reviewers.  It's pretty obvious that this set isn't going to please everybody, which I think is a good thing.  Faust & Melnikov could have played it safe and turn in a by-the-numbers interpretation, but don't we really have enough of those already?  They understand that almost all of these sonatas are Beethoven at his most brash and vigorous, the product of a young composer anxious to make his mark.  Are these supposed to be smooth, polished gems?  It isn't the way my teachers ever taught me to play them, ages ago.  Boy, I wish this set was around when I was a clueless student, erring on the side of caution & timidity.  Faust & Melnikov wring every last bit of passion out of these pieces in a way that I don't often hear.<br /><br />But then you have a performance like that of the 10th sonata, which is as ethereal as anything I have heard.  I imagine that many of the comments about close miking and rough playing stem from this particular sonata, and I can understand why many people would not care for this, but for the sound of bow moving on string just pulls the listener into the wonderful intimacy that this particular sonata is capable of providing --- in the right hands.  Perhaps my own experience playing the violin means that I am not as distracted by the working sounds of the violin (oftentimes airbrushed out of a recording by a clever sound engineer), but who knows?  One of my frequent complaints with Joshua Bell's recordings is that he is closely miked to a truly distracting level.  I guess it comes purely down to the question of personal taste.<br /><br />I agree with another reviewer who said that Melnikov gets the better sound treatment on these recordings.  His piano playing is unbelievably lush at times.  I found myself oftentimes ignoring the violin part (???) as I savored his truly exquisite interpretations.  For the most part, I found the accoustic balance between violin & piano to be just fine.<br /><br />The packaging --- BLECCCH.  Not enough to take a star off the overall rating, but I am sorely tempted to do so.  This packaging is just an absolute pain in the ass, easily avoided if you download the discs onto a hard drive or iPod, but good god --- try to open this set and put a disc in your CD player while standing up.  It flops around wildly, and I was lucky not to have discs spilling onto the ground.  I just want to listen to the damned discs, not take a spatial abilities test.  And yes, 4 CDs is just a stupid waste of space & resources.<br /><br />This is one of the best collections of the Beethoven sonatas in many years, and I'm glad I got it.

B003TU15KM|5.0|I bought these to replace a pair of Tevas that saw hard use over almost ten years and finally fell apart.  These are a worthy replacement.  I saw a number of comments about the heel pad, general comfort, and adjustability, and I honestly can't imagine that these people are reviewing the same product that I bought.  My foot fits wonderfully in the sandal, and the first time I had them on, I wore them for a long outing: driving an hour, walking around for about four hours, then drove an hour home.  I had no trouble with the heel cap digging into my foot  (I even tried several positions to see if I could make it do so), and I had no chafing from the connecting ring (which has a cloth pad under it, and they fit snugly after a couple of tries at adjusting the straps.  My only guess is that people are buying them a half size too small.  I'd recommend these to anyone who needs an excellent, durable pair of sport sandals.  EDIT:  I finally figured out why people are complaining about the connecting ring on the straps.  I recently wore these on a hike -- an honest to god hike, for which I was too lazy to put on my hiking boots.  On very rugged terrain, the ring did hit the malleus painfully when the sandal twisted on my foot.  I was mostly ably to fix this by cranking down on te straps, but the lesson learned is that these are not a good substitute for hiking boots.... nor are they intended to be.

0553801473|1.0|Several years ago I read \\"A Game of thrones\\". I simply loved it. Martin created a world that was alive and more real than our own because, unlike most books of the genre, both the narrative and characterization were realistic even if the setting was a world where each season lasted several decades.<br /><br />\\"A Dance with Dragons\\" in comparison, but also on its own, is a pretty bad book, a promise unfulfilled. In a thousand pages the characters of this book travel thousands of miles: they depart from nowhere and they arrive nowhere too. I don't want to spoil anything but one new character seemed to be created only because Martin is running out of characters to kill and he still has, apparently, two books to go.<br /><br />He created a Red Shirt.<br /><br />This was a great series but the last two books were a disaster worse, they were boring. It pains me a lot buy I only gave it one star because that is the lowest rating available.
B005D9MUWY|1.0|the contract at the beginning of the app requests access to personal information on the phone. Um, why? Why does a keyboard need access to my passwords and data on my phone. Call me paranoid, but i think ill pass.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Even though HTC still indicates that password and credit card information could still be collected when using this input method, if they hold to their own policies, then they are no longer recording keystrokes which is, of course, fantastic news from a security perspective.

B004Y1USV2|5.0|Despite the line-up changes, mostly notable the replacement of Jon Anderson by Benoit David, as lead vocalist, Fly From Here is the best Yes album in quite some time. The opening title track in five parts and overture harkens back to the classic Yes lineup days of extended musical experiences such as Fragile and Close to the Edge (when music came in cardboard sleeves) but has more melodic threads. Steve Howe still anchors the sound with his stylized guitar playing, while Chris Squire's backing vocals have been lessened, clearly putting David in front and center - a role long-time Yes fans might be wary of, but he raises to the occasion very well. His voice is reminiscent of Anderson's yet not a copy. The many lineups the group has gone through over the years suggests Yes can live for quite some time as a brand where progressive rock fans can still come home to even though the members of the family change.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|The app does exactly what it is suppose to do and has the requisite permissions to work properly on your device.  I have been using the 1st Gen SwiftKey for sometime now and have loved it to death, but if you want to upgrade you will lose your previously installed language pack and will need to re-install which isn't a big deal since it only takes a minute or so over a 3G connection.
0062060554|3.0|Very creative story and an interesting idea, but not believable. SPOILER ALERT:    We are really to believe that Mike was able to pose as Ben and remove Christine from a mental health facility? I don't buy it.    Claire calls the school that \\"Ben\\" says he works at and confirms he works there, he was using a false name at work too?    The real Ben still loves Christine and they get back together in the end...too neat, too tidy, don't buy it.    We are supposed to believe that Dr. Nash can be bothered to call Christine every day and remind her of her journal? And that Ben never once walks in and finds her writing in it?      That being said it was a page turner and I read it in record time to see what happened although I knew from the get-go that something was wrong with \\"Ben\\". He was waayy to patient (at least early on in the book). Most people would probably lose their minds dealing with someone like Christine and having to repeat the same things every day.    I also did not find the male author's portrayal of a 40-something female mind. Too much sex and talk about breasts. No woman in her 40's has real boobs worth thinking about.    Otherwise, I did like the book, mainly for the suspense factor.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is a great keyboard. It does take some getting used to if you are coming from Swype or something similar. This is much faster and I am a fan of word prediction rather than word correction. Loving it.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|All you people who had language pack problems, just chill out and try again in 15 minutes.  It didn't download for me at first but I assure you it is working now.  I suspect the popularity of this app is overloading their servers.  Also, like many others, I've been using the beta version for a while now.  Great app, excellent prediction, saves me lots of time when composing texts.

0525951652|2.0|I'm an avid Ken Follett fan, but unfortunately I feel this book missed the mark. It was difficult to distinguish fact from fiction in the events leading up to WWI, even with the author's clarification at the end of the book.  Way too much description of the minute details of trench warfare, military and political complexities. I needed to create my own index of the many, many characters that were introduced, names without much purpose or substance. Very little character development with relationships not flowing.  Maud and Walter being in Berlin and just happening to run into each other while she was sitting in a park after not seeing her for years? Romantic, but highly unlikely. This book could have been written in 300 pages without the extraneous material.  Hopefully, the sequel will be more concise with less military tactics and the characters being developed more fully. The book served as a tool to emphasize that war is not the answer to disputes between countries.
B004AKCME8|3.0|But the dvd itself was flawed. It only worked in my computer's cd drive and not in the dvd drive or player in the living room, which made it hard to watch with family.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This system gets faster and faster the more you use it and the developer is constantly improving and refining. Because of the uncannily accurate predictions, after a while, you end up just entering whole words at a time. Also, how periods, commas,spaces and contractions is handled makes other input methods feel clumsy and slow.

0307272702|5.0|Finally, someone that makes sense! I have always watched what I ate and exercised religiously. I was thin up until a few years ago, when I found myself inexplicably gaining weight.  After the  birth of my third child, I was 20-30 lbs over my normal weight, and unable to lose it, even on Weight Watchers. I also felt perpetually fatigued, suffered from constant headaches and migraines, had constant heartburn/reflux, stomach problems, and developed arthritis. My blood tests showed ridiculously high cholesteral and triglyceride levels, and my liver function was impaired even though I don't drink alcohol at all. Doctors wanted to put me on drugs to deal with each of these issues, and told me to lose weight although they didn't tell me how! I worked with two different nutritionists. I adhered to their recommended low-fat, low calorie diets.  I increased my exercise. My weight did not budge and I was always hungry. I was so discouraged and was starting to get depressed with my inability to lose weight when I read a review of this book in the New York Times.  I immediately bought it and after reading the first few chapters, I realized the author was onto something.  I purged my mind of everything I had ever learned about losing weight, and started following the simple program at the end of the book.  I lost 20 lbs effortlessly within 4 months.  I am no longer constantly hungry. Additionally, eating out is easier on this program than any other I have tried. Even on vacation, it is easy to follow the basic guidelines.  Most importantly, the frequency of my headaches has diminished tremendously, as have my stomach problems and arthritis.  I sleep better and am no longer always fatigued.  I still have to get blood tests to see what the effect has been on my cholesterol, etc., but there is no question in my mind that Gary Taubes has discovered the truth, and has laid it out in a clear, persuasive and compelling way in this book.  I recommended this book to a friend who also struggled with weight and developed assorted health problems, including high blood pressure. My friend has lost over 45 lbs in the same 4 month period and was able to stop using high blood pressure medication.  This book is a life saver.
B005D9MUWY|2.0|Randomly when I hit the backspace to delete a mistype, the keyboard will repeat the last word I types into the text field, and then crash close. Happens pretty much all the time with WhatsApp and Gtalk. Otherwise has potential to be a great kb.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|This is a great keyboard for newer Android phones, but it uses a huge amount of memory (25MB). If you have an older phone with limited memory, you will probably get much better performance from a keyboard that uses 5MB to 10MB of memory.<br /><br />Swiftkey does have a separate keyboard (additional price) for tablets, but this one should work OK on smaller (7\\") tablets.
B004QHK986|5.0|Although I love both Hybrid Theory and Meteora's Linkin Park, A Thousand Suns shows a Linkin Park which is extremely good in so many different ways and shows no fear of evolving.     It all takes a couple of spins without any preconceptions and with an open mind, to really appreciate this concept album.    This CD/DVD version includes a live show in Madrid which shows key ATS songs coupled with several LP classics in glorious video and 5.1 sound. Highly recommended.
B003UESJHY|3.0|Okay, I agree that Christian Bale AND Melissa Leo both deserved the Oscars they won for this movie.  BUT...I really couldn't stomach most of this movie BECAUSE of their performances.  They both played seriously dysfunctional people and they were just too difficult to watch for the entire length of this film.<br /><br />I wish I could have seen more of Mark Wahlberg in his role as \\"Irish\\" Micky Ward.  I thought this movie was about his fighting comeback.  Instead I got close to two hours of dysfunctional family.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I like that I only have to type a few characters of any word, and for many I don't have to type anything at all.
B00003CXCW|5.0|\\"Sunset Boulevard\\" is a brilliant film from director Billy Wilder; the best movie about Hollywood ever made.    One of the great things about this film is that it works on so many levels.  It is at once a bitter commentary on Hollywood's tendency to discard its former stars, a tragic romance, a film noir and a hilarious black comedy.    Another great thing about it is that it uses real locations and real people, which lends an air of verisimilitude to the story.  This is not set in some neverland, but in the real, gritty Hollywood.     The film is perfectly cast:  Gloria Swanson gives one of the greatest performances in film history as faded silent movie star, Norma Desmond.  William Holden was never better.  He plays the hack writer who tries to take advantage of her by agreeing to revise an idiotic script she has written for her \\"return\\" to the movies.  Eventually he is sucked into her obsessive world and becomes her lover.  Former director Erich von Stroheim completes the trio inhabiting the bizarre household on Sunset Blvd..  He is fine as well.  Even the supporting cast is memorable.    Sharply written, superbly directed, gloriously photographed in black-and-white, it is a legendary film.  If you enjoy movies, and particularly if you are interested in film history, you cannot miss seeing this one.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I think this is one of the greatest and advanced keyboards you can buy. However, that beind said, the only thing preventing it from being 5 stars is the fact it doesnt have a swype feature... after swyping my words, I just cant go back to typing.
1451629184|3.0|Review:  Jaycee Dugard was kidnapped from right in front of her home in a quiet forest town by two truly sinister monsters when she was 11.  She was forced to live with this couple and she became the man's sexual plaything.  She had to go through his sexual deviancy when he drugged himself up and eventually bore him two children.  She was eventually rescued 18 years later and reunited with her mother who never gave up hope.  That is the basics of this story.    What you learn from this book is that Jaycee is an amazing human being.  She is forgiving and strong and loving and many, many good adjectives.  I LIKE Jaycee a lot and I'm glad that I purchased this book so that it helps her cause.  I understand too while reading this book, that these are Jaycee's words and her thought processes and that she is still scarred from this tragedy and struggling to make her life better.    Unfortunately, I didn't care for quite a few things in this book.  I am reading some reviewers who state they couldn't read the book, it was too difficult.  I found it to be almost a bit of a sell out.  I wanted more detail.  I wanted to know all the awfulness of the situation.  Jaycee seemed to focus a lot on her love for her kitties.  There's a journal and entries that talk mostly about her kitty that she was allowed to have.  I understand that psychologically, these kitties may have been extremely important to Jaycee's well being but to me, it was completely boring.  If I were to write pages and pages about how much I love my dogs, you would be completely bored.  Just because Jaycee went through a horrific ordeal doesn't make me want to read about her kitties.  It just flat out bored me to death.  Questions that I had weren't answered and maybe they weren't answered for Jaycee either, but I think that the book could have provided some sort of explanations.  In 18 years, Jaycee really felt that she couldn't have escaped?  That is barely discussed in her book.  Her children are barely discussed and at times, I felt that Jaycee loved her kitties more than her own children.  It just felt weird to me.    I am completely supportive of Jaycee and I sincerely pray that her family is awarded a katrillion dollars from the State for their lack of investigation into the life of the sex perpetrator that held Jaycee.  I hope they are able to put their lives back together and I wish nothing but the very best for all of them.  But this book wasn't Jaycee's finest moment.  Perhaps a necessary one in her healing process, but there should have been more.      What I liked:  I like Jaycee Dugard.  She is a courageous and lovely young woman.  I adore that she has such a passion for animals.  As for the book itself, there wasn't much about it that I did like.  I'm sorry Jaycee.  I wanted to like it.  I just think it was silly and very self-serving.  I guess I liked that it was written from Jaycee's perspective.  That made it feel like she was sitting down with me and telling me her story.    What I disliked:  I feel like I got more from this story watching the Diane Sawyer interview.  I feel like most of this book was just blabber and no meat.  The single thing that bothered me the most though?  Jaycee loves her animals.  But when she was rescued, she took great pains in making sure her kitties were well cared for but gave up her dogs without much thought.  That bothered me.  Anyway, I am happy that I purchased this book for Jaycee's cause, but as a book, frankly, it sucked.

B004EPYZOO|5.0|Blending the road movie with the supernatural goes back to Director Jack Starrett's 'RACE WITH THE DEVIL'-1975 and Director Robert Harmon's 'THE HITCHER'-1996 and its remake by Director Dave Meyer.  This film has our main protaganist actually escaping from Hades to exact revenge against a Jim Jones wanna be who murdered his wife and is sacrificing his baby daughter at a full moon ceremony.  Introduce a hot babe into the mix who can hold her own and a satanic character labeled the 'accountant' who wants to get our hero back to hell before Satan finds out and you have the gist of Director Patrick Lussier's 'DRIVE ANGRY', an entertaining hell ride of an action movie.  Nicholas Cage persists in acting in some wild genre titles and is perfect for this role , gorgeous Amber Heard is our mortal waitress who aids Cage and Billy Burke giving the villainy a great upgrade.  William Fichtner as the 'accountant' steals the film and 80's B-movie stalwart Tom Atkins returns in a great cameo.  The usual fight / car chase / incendiary explosions titillate the senses with Michael Wandmacher's excellent electric guitar score aiding the rush.  After all the high octane action movie rushes released this year, 'DRIVE ANGRY' (its the name on the license plate of Amber's car) seems fresh and timeless. Summit Entertainment releases it in a beautiful 1.85 Dolby Digital 5.1 transfer making you not miss the lack of 3D imagery with audio commentary by Director Lussier and Screenwriter/Actor Todd Farmer and Deleted Scenes, a collage of Nicholas Cage mayhem and featurette on the making of the film.  Highly recommended.
031603441X|3.0|I love musician biographies and I'm a big fan of the Stones, so I was crazy excited to read this.  Unfortunately, for me, there just wasn't enough of the book dedicated to music.  I would have loved more insight into the making of classic albums and writing of classic songs, and Keith's approach to music.  Instead, there are tons of pages devoted to his drug use, girlfriends, brushes with the law, pets, friends, and, unfortunately, sharp barbs pointed at Mick Jagger.  Admittedly, this is juicy and interesting stuff, and I am a musician, so perhaps most readers would be more interested in the drama and less interested in particulars regarding music, but I still would have loved it if there were less things like recipes for bangers and mash and more of him opening up about the music.  Nonetheless, it is still a good read.  If you are a Keith fan or a Stones fan you'll definitely want to pick it up, and a lot of fans will appreciate that the album that the most behind the scenes info is given out about is Exile on Mainstreet, but it still left me a little unsatisfied.
B003J27WFW|5.0|Got this DVD as a gift at a time when I was familiar with very little of the Rush catalog. Loved the back-story behind the band members. They came across as well adjusted musicians with a good sense humor and an excellent sense of self awareness. Lots of great insights, some funny, sad and moving. Touches on why these guys have been drubbed by the rock press since day one.  I have watched it several times....excellent. Recommend to any music fan.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is really a great keyboard, the best I've used so far on Android! It is very well developed, and I recommend this to anyone looking for a keyboard other than the stock one.
0375432302|5.0|Read this book a few years ago.<br />I generally don't read fiction but got it as a B'day gift.<br />What a ride! I just couldn't put it down - I read it in one shot, straight for about 30 hours !!<br />Didn't go to work the next day - LOL - I was tired, sleepy and yet had to finish it.<br />Its gripping!!<br />One of the best fiction ( based on some facts ) works in recent years.

Putting the 9V battery in was a little tricky at first, but now that I know how to open the pedal, it will be easy from here on. The pedal sounds great, looks great, and sounds great through my Marshall Half Stack. Definitely recommended!
B005D9MUWY|1.0|if I could give this 0 stars I would!  Once installed it ate up all my computing memory and then when trying it started randomly typing 'I'm a smart beautiful person' over and over...and over....  I normally don't bother reviewing apps I don't like - this went beyond hate.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Super quick response and it's very precise too.  I love everything about this with the exception of its lack of trace input!!!  What happened?  How can you leave that out?  I've been using FlexT9 for a while and love the trace input on it.  But other than trace, FlexT9 is far inferior in terms of feel and speed...but it has trace which makes up for the inferior aspects.  Please consider adding trace input function to this otherwise awesome keyboard.    If you're looking for accuracy, quick response, and great feel, I highly recommend this.  It is very quick!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|The best keyboard for Android since flext9. Predictions are spot on and it just seems smoother. Love the fact that it has themes,  matched up the Neon them with my custom roms base theme.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This application is incredible. The text prediction is very good. Not quite good enough to keep hitting the space bar and have it type out all my messages, but it has learned me pretty quick. Accuracy typing on this keyboard is much higher than the stock HTC/Android keyboard. Great that it was free today, but wouldn't hesitate to pay for it either.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|SwiftKey X is SwiftKey on performance enhancing substances. It's smoother, faster and smarter than before. The suggestions are so good that it's scary. Typing on a 4&quot; screen becomes quick and enjoyable. This review was typed with SwiftKey X.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book brought tears to my eyes for many reasons.  First by the thought of the things Jaycee went through at such a young age.  When I read her story all I could think of was my daughter who is close to the age Jaycee was kidnapped...my heart sank to read her story.  Then tears of joy and inspiration in knowing that she was strong, even with everything that was happening to her she kept going.<br /><br />I'm maddened by the thought that Jaycee and her family still cannot be free due to the media and paparazzi. Let Jaycee and her family finally be free to live their lives already!  They have been through hell and back and the least we can do as a society is let her finally have peace and freedom.<br /><br />And Jaycee, if you read this...thank you for having the courage and strength to tell your story.  You'll forever have a place in my heart. &lt;3
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|The acting, directing, score, and scenery in this film is absolutely divine. Give it a try, and you won't be disappointed!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I bought this book but cant bring myself to read it. I wanted to help Jaycee anyway I can. I cannot imagine the horrors this child went through. I have seen her interviews on television and am impressed and in awe of the honestly bright outlook this woman has after what shes endured. You go Jaycee!!! Your life is yours now continue to be inspiring and positive!!!! You are amazing!!!!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I got SwiftKey immediately after purchasing my first Android phone and have used it since.<br /><br />SwiftKey X is a big improvement over the original SwiftKey, keyboard themes are awesome, but could use a few more theme options.<br /><br />SwiftKey X can even login to your facebook, twitter, or gmail and learn how you type from there. Same with SMS messages stored on your phone.<br /><br />The statistics piece is pretty neat too. SwiftKey has made me 36% more efficient and has saved me 3615 keystrokes.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a great keyboard (the best in my opinion).
1594744769|5.0|I've pretty much drifted away from the horror genre over the past few years, so I probably wouldn't have picked up this book on my own. (Although I did enter to win it from Goodreads, and I have no clue why.) However, I am SO glad I won it and read it. The summary of the book sounds as if you're picking up a book that will give you nightmares. That's not the case at all.     Sixteen-year-old Jacob has always had a special relationship with his grandfather so he's devastated when his grandfather dies. He persuades his parents to let him go to England to see the orphanage where his grandfather grew up so he can finally escape the depression. When he finds the old house, it's a bombed, rotted, empty mess... But things aren't always what they seem...     This YA Fantasy is one of the best books I've read in a while. The pace was great; the characters, who had the potential to be something horrible, were actually fun; and I actually have no complaints about the way the story ended, although it is a bit of a cliff-hanger.     In my opinion, the best part of the book is the photographs. The author used authentic vintage photos of \\"peculiar\\" children. Not that I'd want to sit around staring at the pictures (some of them are pretty creepy), but it's a special touch that just adds another reason to go get this book.

B004GUSG4M|5.0|I read this in one evening -- albeit a long one -- but I really wanted to finish it. It was a great summer easy read. Is it intellectual? No. Is it fun? Yes. This book is not going to win any prizes except for possibly best summer read.  There are gaps and questions that you ask yourself later but, I kept reading and I liked it.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've used swype and a few other keyboards. I paid full price for this one soon after it was first introduced, and it has always been my favorite. Totally worth the $5.
B0055D3EOG|3.0|As the title implies, I have very mixed feelings about this movie. I didn't go into it with high expectations. I've learned not to do that with horror movies anymore. Especially ones that are touted as \\"the next [fill in the blank].\\" Once this movie got rolling, though, I became very excited. The first half was excellent. It was tense, atmospheric, and downright creepy. I am, admittedly, a jaded old horror snob. I haven't been legitimately scared by a movie since I saw \\"The Exorcist\\" for the first time, when I was nine (and that was 22 years ago). On the same token, I also do not judge a horror movie by how \\"scary\\" it is. I judge it by the atmosphere presented and whether or not the writing and film-making capture and hold my attention. If the movie can get a few jumps out of me in the process, that's a fun plus... But it's not the sole criteria by which I evaluate a horror movie anymore.  To his credit, James Wan really showed his chops as an editor and director in the first half of the movie. And Leigh Whannel seemed to have put together an excellent story that melded supernatural horror with very real horror (especially if you're a parent). The music also added a lot to the overall feel. It wasn't your standard synth drones that have become the hallmark of every horror flick made after 1970. They actually had real orchestral instruments, and some great dissonant violin that made my spine feel all twisty.      Yes, it was all very derivative. Overall, the first half of \\"Insidious\\" was basically a hybrid of \\"The Exorcist\\" and \\"Poltergeist,\\" as many have already noted, and there were also elements of \\"Flowers in the Attic,\\" which I have not seen noted... But it was so well executed that any unoriginality was forgivable. And, besides, if you're gonna rip *anyone* off, you may as well rip off the best! The first half of the movie presented believable characters in a scary situation that was made scary by what you didn't see or what you barely saw, and did not over-rely on rubber monsters or obvious CG effect that ultimately detract from the overall chill factor. It was a total throwback to classic horror movies, that had me on the edge of my seat with excitement. Not just excitement for what was happening on-screen, but excitement for the genre as a whole.    Then, about half way into the movie, Darth Maul made a guest appearance. Well, maybe not *actually* Darth Maul... But a \\"demon\\" that looked a lot like him. It was all downhill from there.    The latter half of the movie became a straight-up cartoon. All the great set-up and intensity that was established in the beginning was pushed over like a house of cards.  It started with an out-of-place, overtly comedic pair of over-the-top nerdy ghost hunters (one of whom uses a modified ViewMaster to see ghosts... I s**t you not).  When Lin Shaye's psychic character came into the picture, I had some hope. Lin is a veteran actress who really knows how to control the screen, and her character seemed interesting enough. She even flirted with the idea of sending her two ghost-goobers away, which made me think: \\"Ok. Cool. The comic relief was here to lighten the mood, so that we could be once again slapped-around with the horror stick when we were just getting comfortable.\\" Alas, that was not the case, and this film's equivalent of Jar Jar Binks was in it for the long haul. (Wow! I'm really racking up the \\"Phantom Menace\\" references here, aren't I?)    The rest of the movie did the exact opposite of what the first half had established. It took all of the ghosts and brought them into the green-filtered light of day, in all of their overly-made-up glory. The whole thing took on an atmosphere similar to the yearly spookhouse that the local YMCA puts on for Halloween. But the thing that makes the spookhouse fun and scary is that you are actually in the middle of it, stumbling around in the dark and wondering who is going to pop out at you next. \\"Insidious\\" didn't have that same value, since it was just a guy on a screen stumbling around in the dark and the camera angles made it pretty obvious when and where someone was going to pop out at him. Frankly, it was boring.  Now, don't get me wrong. The in-your-face monster atmosphere can work in a movie. It worked for the \\"Evil Dead\\" movies. It works in slasher movies. Heck, it even worked in the contemporary version of \\"Thirteen Ghosts.\\" But the thing that made it work there is that the threat existed of the monsters actually *doing something* to the person whose face they are getting into. When monsters gets all up in your grill, they have to spew something, or attack, or try to swallow your soul, or something.  The ghosts/monsters in \\"Insidious\\" basically just popped up in front of the hero, made a funny noise and an ooky face, then backed off. It was like a haunted game of Whack-a-Mole. Ultimately it came off as more silly than scary, and totally invalidated everything that the first half of the movie worked so hard to set up.    As for the ending: I won't spoil it, but I have mixed feelings about it too. On one hand, it made perfect sense given the way everything had been set up. On the other hand, it wasn't all that creative. Movies ending this way have become the standard for \\"edgy\\" horror in Western film-making, but haven't actually been \\"edgy\\" for about half a decade because it's what everybody does. It's often said that a bad ending can ruin a good movie, and a good ending can justify a bad movie. This movie proves that a mediocre ending keeps a movie mediocre.    Given their history together, I suspect that Wan and Whannel wanted to make a vastly different movie (they created the \\"Saw\\" franchise, after all), but the studio wanted a PG-13 horror movie, and so the writer and director toned it down accordingly. Unfortunately, the tone-down came across as a water-down. Honestly, if they had stuck to the format that they established in the beginning, and built it to a climax that way, this movie could have been great and nowhere near an R rating. \\"The Others\\" did this exceedingly well, back in 2001. Wan and Whannel obviously know how to make a good, unsettling, psychological horror movie. Maybe next time they'll be consistent about it.    Let's try to end this on a positive note. The first half of the movie was excellent. The music was great. I give props to the director for using human actors, lighting, and camera tricks to tell his story, and not falling back on crappy CG. The first half of the movie shows that there is still hope for the Hitchcock school of horror. And, even in her sixties, Barbara Hershey is still gorgeous. So, good going on all of that. On the whole, I give this 2.5 stars, out of 5.  It had a boatload of potential, but sadly fell flat.
B002QGSW8I|1.0|It is offensive because it features animal abuse and it presents it as comical. I set fire to it to stop anyone else reading it!!!!!!!!!!  Think im joking?
B004BLJQOK|5.0|An absolutely wonderful movie. Leaves much to the imagination. Decided to read the book but it differs in the very aspects that made the movie so cool. Stick to the film version. TRUST ME.
B005D9MUWY|2.0|First thing you'll notice is this takes up a lot of space on your screen, makes your available space for typing message smaller than typical. i purchased this months ago and was initially impressed but then ran into FlexT9 and found that keyboard app to be much better for my uses.  I tried this new version of swiftkey and immediately went back to FlexT9 as it does trace ( swype style) entry as well a the touch typing.  FlexT9 also doesn't use up valuable screen space any more than the standard keyboard screen.  Also found the look of swiftkey to not be appealing to me.

B00518HBD0|5.0|First of all, I don't understand all the negativity about having \\"radio friendly\\" songs.  Exactly what band or musician sets out to make commercially available music/albums and says \\"Gee, I hope none of our music is good enough to get played on the radio for everyone to hear, or be introduced to people outside of our fan base that might actually buy our album or come to see us play live.\\"  Isn't that the whole point of being in a band, making music that thousands of people (or in 3 Doors Down case, millions of people) enjoy listening to in order to keep selling records and concert tickets?  If it weren't for \\"radio friendly\\" songs Kryptonite, then how the hell would any of us ever have known who 3 Doors Down was?  Now on to my review.    Another great album from a great band.  I have been a fan since The Better Life and have enjoyed each album from these guys.  They always seem to change the mood and sound on each album, and they set the bar pretty high with the energy of The Better Life in 1999.  In 2002, when Away From the Sun came out I didn't care much for it as an album but I did enjoy a few songs, it almost sounded like a different band and was very different (night and day) and rather mellow compared to The Better Life, but it grew on me and it is a great piece of musical art.  Seventeen Days from 2005 was a bit more upbeat with some great songs but lacked the flow of the previous two.  When the self-titled 3 Doors Down came out in 2008, I didn't like it much at first but over the last few years it has been my \\"Go To\\" album for 3 Doors Down and I possibly enjoy it as much if not more than The Better Life (probably because I wore The Better Life out listening to it so much).  So now in 2011 we have Time of My Life, it sounds a lot like the previous album which is not something they have done before and even a song or two sounds as if it could have been on a bonus track on a re-release of The Better Life which is probably why there was no break in time for me on this one, I liked it instantly.  This album has great energy, some of their hardest songs to date.  Track 5, Race For the Sun is awesome and the guitars actually make you want to race something.  The album has a nice flow and some great songs. I think they have found a great \\"place to hang their hats\\" musically with the sound they have now, but who knows what direction they will go from here. Definitely going to enjoy it over the next few years and I look forward to their next release.
B004LWZW24|5.0|I have to tell you after watching this one, I was looking over my shoulders quiet a bit. Especially if you watch it late at night, when your house is deadly quiet after watching it. Then you start hearing things in the night,\\"This movie is really creepy!\\" Alot of surprises around every corner, and this movie starts out creepy at the very beginning, things are taking place right away that tells you right off the bat that somethings not right in this house. And don't you just hate it when you leave a creepy house, and the weird stuff moves with you when you do. Trust me, if you like scary movies you need to add this one to your collection, you won't be disappointed. If you don't purchase it, creepy things are going to happen in your house. \\"Just kidding,\\" But you need to see this one. I gave it five stars, for scary stuff!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B004LWZW24 Insidious]]  [[ASIN:B004LWZW2E Insidious [Blu-ray]]]
