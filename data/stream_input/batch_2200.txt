B00BHMETKC|5.0|True story, great acting, interesting storyline. Not sure if it truly is the best movie of the year, but it is def worth watching
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A fun game that doesn't get boring. Love the change in scenery or theme each month. Look forward to the daily challenge and missions.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|First of all I hate the 'undead' genre in movies, video games and books (unless I'm playing  D & D or its about witty evil ghosts) I'm a hard sci-fi buff. The only reason I read this book was because I saw a preview of the movie with Brad Pitt, not knowing what the movie was about and thinking it had something to do with outer space, I downloaded a sample from my kindle. After reading the sample I became interested in the book and bought it and I have to say I was a great read, the way the book was put together and written...fantastic.
B008M4MB8K|4.0|This has several (if not all) the versions of this movie that have been released over the years. (I hear a sequel is finally in the works). The only thing I didn't like about this packaging is the content other than the movies. Don't get me wrong, It's worth it just for the movies, but they talk about the content with the storyboards and the booklet, really wasn't that exciting one you open the cover, just get it to watch the movies, worth the price if you're a fan.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|If you haven't seen this series yet, I would suggest starting at the beginning. It is worth it. Another great season.  Looking forward to what happens next!
B008MIMWOO|5.0|It made me randy because it was only 10 bucks for all three movies. I'm sure the box set with a million extra features will come out soon, but for $10 you get 2 and a half good movies, yeah baby!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is probably the best Nicholas Sparks book I have read to date.  Very different and unexpected!  I would highly recommend this book.....get ready for the tissues at the end!
B00BESM14U|4.0|This film was really well done. They did a great job capturing the some of the more awkward experiences of high school while not over doing it. The characters were interesting and the plot kept me intrigued the whole movie.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love this game. It gets harder as you go on. But it is still really really fun. I play it all the tine.
B005COO1X6|5.0|A short sojourn into the mundane world created by Stephen King that we love so much. He makes everyday things soooo creepy! Read this!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I promise you won't be disappointed when selecting this.  We couldn't stop till we had watched all of it.  The only thing we didn't like is having to wait till the next season comes out.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This book covers a sad part of the history of our great country.  I felt such shame for the ignorance of that generation.  The cruelty when dealing with the slaves made me very angry.  I wondered about their Christianity, and during my reading I kept thinking &#34;Now I know why Abraham Lincoln was placed on this great earth.&#34;
B002C6A6N6|5.0|Really loved this TV Series when I was a kid and I am happy that I was able to get an official boxed set since Seasons 4 to 6 no longer aired on Philippine TV during the late 90's to early 2000's.  Joe Lando is sooo hot and I think he was my first manly man crush. Haha!  Jane Seymour, of course, is timeless.  Dr Quinn served as an inspiration to me.  As a young girl, I looked up to her independence and courage.  Some of the things that stuck: Stand up for what you believe in.  And true love + a successful career do exist. ;)<br /><br />No problems on the DVD set; no scratches.<br /><br />Good times.
1601251556|5.0|My D&D group didn't have any tiles and only had a few of the maps from modules that I had purchased, but when it came to us creating our own adventures there was nothing for it. This Flip-Mat (with a set of wet-erase markers) was the perfect solution. Our first campaign on it was well illustrated and was very easy to lay out, I highly recommend it to anyone who is trying to start out on their own adventures.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Actually has a decent story line besides the sex, which is pretty envigurating, but the book is bigger than just the BDSM sex. I have recommended it to a number of my male friends who have since read it and liked it.
B009O2XY12|3.0|I have this game on my phone, however when I found that it was available for kindle I was glad to move it to the larger screen. The graphics were great, sparkling clear. However I was a bit put off because the app seems to have less capabilities than the apple version. For instance, I can sign on through Facebook with my phone but the kindle version does not have this capability, so I can't simply start the game where I left off because it doesn't connect to any type of system which would allow me to do so.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very enjoyable. I love that they change the city once in a while. Controls are easy<br /> Both me and my 10 love playing the game
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun! I love playing it! Very addicting! Can't stop playing! Definitely one of the best games out there!
B005D0RDKW|5.0|If you love Rush, this is a MUST HAVE disc.  Great show...great sound...great visuals.  RASH!  What more could you ask for?  Buy this now!  :)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show has just the right amount of everything, zombies, drama, zombies, great story, oh and did I mention zombies? I am an avid fan of the zombie world and this show nails that description on the head. I already own seasons one and two and I am going to pre-order this season soon to add to my zombie collection. The acting is great, the zombies look great, and I would recommend this to any zombie fan if they haven't already seen it. SO WORTH IT!
B00004TS0E|4.0|This is a great modern take on the original movie, but one can tell that it is a remake. While trying to make it more modern  a lot of its original charm and character is lost. It was definitely worth what I paid for it and is a great Christmas film, just not a classic like the original.
B00A8KJK7G|1.0|I really love this movie! It is a little like Paranorman which I also liked. So much better than most of the drivel being put out today.
B009LS4KM6|5.0|Bought this for my 3 year old and we love it. Another great Seuss film! I would recommend it to all
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I bought this for my husband. He's a hug Star Wars fan. It comes with a ton of special bonus features that he loved
B0094KTC6K|5.0|We love documentaries and this is a great one! Oscar is a lovable little guy and his story is inspiring
1452101248|5.0|I love to cook and have innumerable cookbooks ( which I DO  use for preparing meals).  I read about Yotam Ottolenghi and his restaurant so decided to purchase this book.  Recipes produce truly delicous and healthy food.  Note that you may have to buy some ingredients--- this is not a cookbook to use for just throwing a quick meal together. The photos are beautiful and I also enjoyed just reading it,  went ahead and bought the next cookbook- 'Jerusalem' and it is also excellent.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a really addictive fun game. For me I personally think this is aimed at anyone and everyone will enjoy it. I gave it 5 star rating because I love how they've the country's it's based in so yo  get a taste of that places setting and surroundings.
B009B4ZEKM|1.0|I was very unhappy with this album. Have previously enjoyed her music & listen to it often. I have lost a lot of respect for her as an artist. I don't feel it's necessary to have the \\"f\\" word in music. I understand and appreciate her cutting edge style, however, I felt dirty listening to this cd. She's better than that!
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|Sure the game is fun. But yet again wants real money to purchase peanuts which you need to refuel your jeep in order to capture animals for your zoo. I dislike games that take your money. So many parents r becoming victim of these games that target children. You can put a password on your child's kindle. This app didn't say anything about real money. Very disappointed!!!!!!!!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Gave this to my mother for Valentines Day. His lovely voice blasting through the house is really fun!! He is one of the greatest singers alive in my opinion!!!
B001XUJMZK|4.0|William Wallace stood on Principle..some things are worth dying for. The youth of today do not have that mind set.
0375869026|5.0|Book # 24 Read in 2013<br />Wonder by R.J. Palacio (YA)<br /><br />August (Auggie) was born with a facial deformity.  Up until now (the 5th grade) he has been home schooled.  He decides to try 5th grade in a regular school.  He expects to be treated oddly by some but while that is true, Auggie is also pleasantly surprised by others.  Auggie strives to come into his own during this first year of school.<br /><br />I loved this book.  Auggie was a wonderful character.  He was brave, funny and genuine.  There was a wonderful cast of characters in this book--Auggie's parents and sister, Jack Will, Summer and the middle school principal.  I recommend this book.<br /><br />[...]

B000QQFKYE|5.0|As a David Lynch fan, I wanted to see anything he had done. I wasn't disappointed and you won't be either.
B009X2CUYA|3.0|I enjoyed this book. And was very hooked to keep reading. A very good twist at the end which you dont expect. It was a good book but not a great book. My favourite of this author is the forgotten garden which i rated 5/5 stars. This book is as great but i still enjoyed!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|It's a nice little time waster. I'm not willing to spend that much on gems so a lot of content is going to take a looooong time to get.
B009X2CRMK|5.0|Kept me hooked this book! Really really enjoyed. Good narrative, great twists! I highly reccomend! Its a really awesome story!
B004XDYJRU|3.0|love the app but the latest update wont install on my kindle fire. I get he same error as everyone else. they news to either fix the package or the new app. very frustroating.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like this bible as it gives so many different version at the click of a button. It would be nice if it gave a least one version on the internal memory so I could use it when I'm unable to get to the internet.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Couldn't put it down! I got lost in the world of Panem, its misery, the rebellion, and the love triangle. I will get nothing done until I finish this series!
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Excellent sequel to iron man and a must for all fans this three disc set is a must buy to your blu ray collection picture and sound quality is superb far superior over the dvd version can't wait for iron man 3!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I love it hours of gameplay please add more to the campaigning episodes please and make millions of more elements please exciting amazing spectacular and acestanding<br />Magical big fun entertaining
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it is a fun game. I like the tour. I wonder where we will be going next.I love this game.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great book- great characters- hope that it sheds a light on mental illness in America.<br />The pain I felt for him in his struggle to get better as well as the hope I had for he and his dad to connect. His dad must have known his pain but could not reach out to him, that was very sad.<br />But he and his mom's relationship was very sweet and funny.<br />Funny and heartwarming
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I like it it keeps you busy for about three hours on a long road trip and it was easynenough that my. eight year old enjoyed it
B002XMGGK6|5.0|We must have watched this movie 10 times. I love the twists of events at the end!!! This is definitely a movie to see if you have not seen it already.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|it was lagging a lot<br />it made my kindle crash<br />it was just a horrible app<br />i would rather spend the $7.00 and get the real Minecraft
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I enjoy matching things that are not familiar sites; makes it more challenging.  Sometimes have to look at the smallest details
B00992CF6W|5.0|I could not find an update button, but I did find that if you uninstall the app you can get it again from your cloud and it will download your new version.  All of your data will be saved to the app so don't worry about losing your diamonds.  BEST GAME EVER.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|I love true stories in general.  This is a very sensitive treatment of a topic most Americans find difficult to discuss.  It provides an insight into the challenges some individuals face everyday and makes one reflect on the good fortune of a working muscular system.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the reading. It was full of action and unexpected twists. But it became so annoying when page after page was another episode of Katniss blaming herself for the most recent death and all those previous while the other person or people said, \\"Not your fault.\\"
B004T2QZL8|4.0|Fun to just sit and play around with when you have a few minutes to waste<br /> Be careful though too much time with this game at one time will make you bored with it
B00B2V66VS|5.0|\\" The games graphics are awesome , the interaction is tight  the real time action rocks I would reccomend this game to my friends. AWESOME rating. Larry STERIO
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great calculator, calculator has big numbers, and is easy on the eyes. I recommend this calculator to everyone . I keep in my carousel because it so handy.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Great personalities developed in show. The nites I watched this show I found myself totally caught up in the show.
0439023521|4.0|I bought the trilogy for my teen granddaughter since she expressed interest in it.  I found it quite violent but very spell-binding.  I'm sure that I, as a teen, would have been delighted to find books like these to experience such an exciting world and exciting adventure.  I think she will be pleased to go on that journey.
B002ZG994U|4.0|Alot of action and alittle comedy to go with it. I like all actors that played in it. Especially Liem Neelson.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|How nice to see a well scripted movie with wonderful actors playing characters you actually care about! Delightfully funny, touching, insightful, and family friendly. For fans of English humor, this one is definitely a keeper!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game!!!! It is so creative!!! Whoever created this game I want to say thank you and keep doing what u do. I like when you update it you go to different places.
B007PT1PEY|4.0|I love the new show Elementary on tv and reading the original Sherlock Holmes stories really adds to my enjoyment of the tv show as well as giving me a whole new level of appreciation for the original.
B001GCUO1Q|3.0|love this movie, totally one of my all time faves being such an xman buff. decided to buy the dvd from amazon but received a busted package. not pleased at all
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|This collection was $100 everywhere we looked but here on amazon it was only $50 ... What steal! We bought one right away it had only been out maybe a month or 2 at the time and it was worth it! We are both big fans of the show and could not pass this up!
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|I first read the series of  three novels, then watched the three Swedish movies... and loved every single one. So sad the author passed away shortly after finishing the series. So, one might have wondered, how could the American remake stand up to the original films? Simple. Star Daniel Craig and you have something unique and well worth watching.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|You won't have read much like this I don't think - funny and quirky but a little bit horrifying too - its an entertaining, easy read.
0062197258|4.0|Honestly, I am a humor writer... newspaper and magazine columns and author of the BooCat series... and after reading this book, I felt moved to try my hand at a bit of terror... and created NORMAL, a novel... (soon to be available on amazon.com). It was this well written novel that inspired me. Elizabeth Haynes did a very good job keeping me, the reader, spellbound throughout.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its an awesome app.  l love it. this app lets you take care of your pretend horse better than any other app out there.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|This is a really clever game that makes me want to keep playing.  I never get frustrated with the game. The challenge is to collect the most hearts while keeping the rollercoaster on the track.  The rollercoaster keeps growing in length which makes it challenging but doable at the same time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and addictive I play it a ton. I would like to know if there is a subway suffers rio.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Frankly, I don't know why I'm reviewing Facebook as a \\"purchase?\\" Perhaps it is because I ordered it for my Kindle Fire, so I can tap into Facebook when I'm not sitting at my desktop computer. In any event, I like Facebook because it provides me with a method of tracking the activities of the younger generation. Not just my nieces and nephews, but the many distant cousins I have been able to befriend because younger people tend to ignore my somewhat advanced age if I contact them via Facebook. In addition, I have formed a group on Facebook composed of people all over the world who just happen to share my Y-Chromosome Haplogroup designation, and this provides me with a window into their respective cultures, and well as being a place where we can all share the latest scientific findings about the one thing we all have in common: the same mutations in our Y-Chromosomes. Of course, it is also a great place to look up old classmates and friends from long ago, and to keep track of what one's grandchildren are doing. Often I know more about my grandchildren's activities than their own parents do. Why? Because I follow them on Facebook, and their parents do not, even though I live in Florida, and they all live in Germany.

0307272702|5.0|I have reviewed this book elsewhere, but it remains one of the best available &#34;must read&#34; books on the reasons for the &#34; why and what to do&#34; aspects of America's weight problem. It is a shorter explanation of the author's more textbook like &#34;Good Calories-Bad Calories.&#34; It is course 101 in avoiding metabolic syndrome, and should be required reading for all high school biology students, and their parents. It will never achieve that status, however, because those whose business it is to choose our school textbooks are interested in protecting our government from its roll and complicity in fostering upon an unsuspecting public, a food pyramid which was upside down from where it should have been, and spread the word using tax payer dollars over the past 40 years, resulting in the ever-expanding waistlines of the American population. In condemning all fats as undesirable the government applauded the reaction of the food industry wherein they took the fat out of our food and replaced it with high fructose corn syrup, which results in pushing one's blood sugar sky-high, stimulating the pancreas to pump out insulin to pull the blood sugar into the fat cells. When this process is done over and over time after time, one's cells eventually become insulin resistant and one becomes both fat and diabetic. That is metabolic syndrome, and we all need to avoid that!
B001CB8NQE|3.0|Picardo did not mesh with cast felt like an outsider. Might have been intentional but took away from the enjoyment for me.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I personally do not watch much TV, but became very fixated with this series.  It is absolutely one of the best productions I have every seen and cannot wait until the next season.  This and Game of Thrones is absolutely the best on TV.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I hadn't really had time for any reading I wanted to do, and I ended up getting this on my kindle for a long weekend and read it in two days. It was extremely engaging, fast paced with characters that you really connect with and feel for.  Get the tissues ready though.  I definitely shed a few tears which doesn't happen often when reading for me.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|This game is so excellent!  Have just spent wonderful hours playing.  Am looking for more games similar to this one.  Great for the mind, and improve with working these puzzles.  Some are simple, but gets progressively more difficult and the challanges are quite tough which is a challange to me.
B00846F1YW|5.0|This game has good graphics, an interesting storyline that doesn't make you want to just skip the story scenes. The objects are challenging to find, but not impossible, and easy too click on once you find them. Unlike some other h.o. games, staring at the scenes doesn't give me a headache.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|First, started watching the Game of Thrones on Demand.  Both my husband and me were quickly addicted.  Now, we are watching both Season I and Season II over again.  Sometimes, we go for 4 hours straight, cause just can't quit.  I then decided I wanted more, so started with the third book in series.  Just cannot put it down - already know the characters pretty much.  Just this weekend (since Friday), read 300 pages (out of over 900) and can't seem to put it down.  Would love to see a guide book like there is one for &#34;A Clash of Kings.&#34;  Highly recommend to all, except if you have never watched the show, start with Book I.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Love the game. Kills time and works my nerves. The touch screen tests my reflexes but after awhile you get used to it.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|The movie gets off to an intense star and has some great acting - although I thought the John Goodman character was a bit cliche/over the top.  Denzel is excellengt as always and I did appreciate the honest end of the movie.  Some nudity/drug and alcohol use make this movie inappropriate for young teens.
B006BZ8WAI|5.0|I have loved korn since i was a teenager. This new cd is a great mix between their old style and the new dubstep style.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Very good book, cannot wait to read the rest of the trilogy. The film was a good movie, the book is even better. It's the type of book which makes you never want to put it down. You just want to continue reading, until it's over, and you're finally glad to finish it, but also upset that it came to an end.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I use this app making my grocery list. I can check items, and then use the same list again when I shop the next time. Big time saver, and organizational tool. Love it!!!
B004XN3FHA|5.0|In search & rescue you need a powerful, durable flashlight, and the Fenix TK41 flashlight is the best. I have been looking for such a flashlight for years.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I  Immediately read book two of the trilogy and can't wait for his next book.<br /><br />Once you start reading, you can't put the book down
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Took a while to get into it but glad I kept reading. Wonderful book. I'm excited to start the next book!
B005LAIGW8|2.0|I have no idea where Nic Cage is going these days,* he might have made this cos he didn't get to put on Supermans suit in planned remake a couple of years ago, which didn't eventuate, so, maybe he thought. \\"I'll do 'Kick Ass' and this one and see what happens\\".<br />Really he should have stuck to 'Kick Ass' and insisted the ending, or his ending, be changed.<br />It is possible you may like this, I thought it was ordinary.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I'm not a fan of period pieces, but this show blows everything else out of the water.<br /><br />The character development is solid, the story engaging, the acting superb.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|There really isn't much I can say about this movie. well there is one thing.<br />Wow! Anyone who saw it should agree with that three lettered observation. Just, WOW! The story is a great finale, the characters are so captivating, I couldn't help becoming emotionally involved with their ups and downs.<br />I can't say too much, if you haven't seen the movie but have seen the first two stories you are in for a treat, I don't want to spoil the story for you.<br />If you have seen it then you know how good it is, but blue-ray and a theatre sound system will enhance it!!!<br />Highly recommended. Wow!!!<br /><br /> N.B. I haven't got the Ultraviolet digital copy or even own a Blue ray version as yet, I did rent one though. I can't compare the formats. I can only comment on the movie I saw at the cinema and again on a rented blue ray.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|simple to use, and it sharpens very well. -plus, it's compact, and carbide blade is reusable. A great tool for future camping or fishing.
B009VMN3RA|4.0|Fascinating account of what it's like to be a mega icon's daughter.  Sachi's feelings of abandonment, resentment, and betrayal are heart wrenching.  She had much to overcome, but finds her way in the end.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so much better than the first one. My friend told me about this game and I was amazed at Temple Run 2. The graphics are amazing and the new ziplines and jumps, turns, ducks, and dives are so much better. I personally love this game!!!!!!
B007SGM084|5.0|i loveeeeeed the trilogy.  I read it all in a week and a half.  i plan on reading it again.
B007L5GDGW|2.0|I got this game as a free app of the day, which is fortunate, because had I not I'd want my money back. This game doesn't keep track of progress, doesn't have a score, and is mediocre at best. On my tablet device, the game runs off the screen. I suppose it's a fine game, but there are certainly better games out there for free.
0380799006|2.0|This book is filled with complaints from adult children who blame their parents for everything. It is our job as parents to train our children to handle conflict appropriately. They must be taught to respect each other as individuals. This is not taught in school and letting \\"work it out\\" by themselves is wrong. Teach your kids to take responsibility for their actions and they are less likely to blame you when they grow up.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|can write as many notes as you want, can color numbers if you want to for whatever reason, can have as much or as little assistance as you want, thousands of levels, alternate versions of Sudoku, difficulty from very easy (which isn't as easy as I'd expect, but it's not too hard) to nightmare...this has everything I'd hope for in a Sudoku game and more.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put this down!<br /> Great suspense and story of survival. Imagine living in a world where death was the o my way to survive!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great game!  I put it on my kindle fire for my grandson who is 6 and he loved the bigger size.
B0053KWDES|5.0|I bought this product because I've recently been doing a lot of listening to music on my desktop PC, with my ATH-M50 headphones running into the headphone jack of some standard Bose speakers. Going back and forth between that and my iPod, I noticed that the sound quality on the iPod is a lot worse in comparison and not nearly as bassy, and it turns out that this is normal. A lot of headphone outputs on portable media devices are apparently pretty poor in quality. So, I read that the Line-Out port of any iOS device produces much, much higher quality audio and with a headphone amp, you can boost the frequencies (like the bass) without overdoing it. So, I bought this and the L9 Line Out cable together. And all I can say is:<br /><br />IT'S PERFECT!<br /><br />I've read a lot of reviews of this product saying that the ATH-M50's don't benefit from being amped. I'm completely shocked at this. After listening to the M50's with the FiiO E11, the difference is day and night. The ATH-M50's not only produce the same quality as my desktop PC in a portable package, it actually sounds BETTER than my desktop PC.<br /><br />- High/Low Gain feature. Higher gain will drive your headphones harder, which will amplify all the frequencies and give them a TON of 'oomph'. But for smaller headphones, like any type of ear buds, lower gain is better because they're easier to drive.<br /><br />- EQ switch:<br />0 setting = No coloration. Sound is only amplified by the E11 without any additional boost in the bass, mids, or treble.<br />1 setting = Sub-bass boost. Amplifies the deep bass that can normally only be heard in high end headphones. Bass drops, for example, are incredibly lively with this setting on. You can actually feel the bass hit your head if you have the E11 cranked (and by cranked I only mean about 3. This thing is LOUD)<br />2 setting = Sub-bass boost x2 and mid-bass boost. This setting is where all bassheads dream of. Imagine headrattling bass booms. Even the tiniest 'whoomp'of bass in any track will be very, very amplified. And not in a bad way either! The amp doesn't muddy the sound at all nor does it drown out any of the other frequencies with this setting. This setting is bass heaven. I kid you not, if you're a basshead and the thought of hearing bass that feels like it's actually vibrating your head makes your mouth water, this setting will do just that. Turn the E11 on High Gain, turn it up to a suitable volume, and set the EQ to 2 and BOOM (literally).<br /><br />My only gripes about this thing have nothing to do with the sound. I feel like the In and Out jacks are too close together. They should have been put on opposite sides or something. With the Line Out cable and the M50 cable plugged in at the same time, the two cables are uncomfortably close to one another and I feel this may lead to problems in the future. People have said that the E11 sometimes has issues with the two audio jacks failing after several months or so and I can see why. For people who buy this planning on going jogging and plan to stuff this and their iPod in their pocket, I feel like the two jacks being so close to each other may inevitably cause one to break, but I can't say for sure. I may be wrong, but that's just my observation. I bought this so I could have a high quality portable audio setup. I don't plan on ever listening to music with the E11 outside of my house (a plane ride might be the only exception).<br /><br />All in all, this device completely exceeded my expectations! When I ordered it, I was actually already starting to think that I'd made a mistake because I was debating between this and the Digizoid ZO2, and I thought that I'd probably end up returning this and buying the ZO2 instead. But I was totally wrong. This did exactly what I wanted it to, and then some. I wasn't expecting it to surpass my desktop PC setup's audio quality, but it did. And now bassdrops will forever be punchy enough to rattle my brain. Highly recommended product!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Great game!  I put it on my kindle fire for my grandson who is 6 and he loved the bigger size.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|I got this for my husband for Christmas and he really enjoyed listening to the songs of Paul Simon! I grew up on Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel so I knew it was going to be a great CD. Great music from a great artist!

B008DM4OTA|3.0|My almost 3-yr old likes the Dr. Panda's restaurant and veggie garden more.  This one seemed to have fewer things to do.  It also seemed to have fewer sounds/details to keep her attention and it takes longer to switch between scenes.  Not long, but long enough with  a toddler's attention span.
0553278355|5.0|I read this in high school and I wanted to revisit it. I am glad that I purchased it as opposed to just getting it from a library because I want my future daughters to read it too.
B00BHNR1KQ|3.0|A decent movie, but easily predictable. Definitely ok. Lol, both the girlfriend and her daughter would rate it 4stars, so its worth seeing. If you go into it thinking it sucks, it'll probably be great. I went in being told it was great and it wasnt
B00821OX98|4.0|Really like the character development. Not a lot of action, but when things happen they are unexpected and due to the development, I genuinely cared about the people. Unlike other sci-if attempts that rely on effects and neglect the details.
0007466064|2.0|Took longer than anticipated to arrive.  Definately was not new, I would have bought it anyway, but, its just wrong to advertise it as such.
B004INNRFK|5.0|My husband and I got a chance to see a portion of this DVD while on a recent trip to Dorado, Puerto Rico. We went to a lovely neighborhood cafe for lunch and the manager was playing this DVD on the big screen television when we arrived. The music was the perfect accompaniment to our meal and we stayed awhile after eating drinking and watching. The manager was nice enough to share the title with us and as soon as we returned home, I immediately ordered it. This is such a great music experience that we will never tire of watching! My only regret is I wasn't there when it was recorded in Las Vegas!
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I don't think I would have embarked on this journey even when I was young and limber.<br />But the book is exceptionally well-written and evocative. Dealing with grief from the death of a loved<br />one is different for everyone.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|Have always loved pinball and the touch screen adaptation is so much more fun than the keyboard for computer version. This is colorful and fun and gives you three games to play with seperate score boards. a pause option would be neat since I have two immensely distracting toddlers. Over all great app though.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I absolutely Loved this book! I was hooked from the very beginning and was upset when I actually finished reading it. I didn't want it to be over.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|I love this app and my kids love to watch me play it. I don't love that it is sooo hard to earn the help or that you have to be connected with the interenet in order to collect your once every 24 hour bonus (once a day would be better since I do not want to have to set an alarm...) I am currently trying to earn hello kitty wish I would have expected to be my first character or at least not take three months (or cash on a free app) to get. But over all really love the app.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|This was on a gift list for my sister. She loves it, and listens to it regularly. Price as well as direct shipping to her was cheaper than purchasing it locally and then mailing it myself. I would recommend the CD based on my sisters recommendations. I would recommend the seller based on my experience
B008K6HN8I|5.0|ES File Explorer works just like Windows \\"My Computer\\" does to allow you to navigate you Kindle Fire HD's files.  You'll need a file navigator to install side loaded apps not available on Amazon and this App, sure is the easiest one to use that I've tried.  This is such a necessary App I am surprised that the Kindle Fire HDs do not come with a file navigation method.  Also easy to use to clear out junk left over in your Kindle Download file that you probably don't realize is there.  I got it free, but if there was a charge and I knew it would work as good as it does, I certainly would pay a reasonable fee to purchase.
B000QXDED6|5.0|I could not find this locally and it was requested for a gift. My friend loves this movie. I watched it once which was enough for me. I get it. She has watched it over and over. Total cost of item and shipping was very reasonable  and it arrived quickly.
B003X8597A|1.0|I was very excited to buy a DVD of Rienzi, but this was a great disappointment.  My husband and I are opera fans, but we both found this staging and presentation oppressive and unpleasant, and quit watching after enduring the first half hour.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I'm going to go out on a limb here with this review, but I've seen The Hobbit twice, read the book 10 or 12 times and have never gotten tired of it. When I had heard an actual film version of this great book (I'm not talking about the 1977 Rankin Bass cartoon)I would finally be done, I was ecstatic. If people truly consider the style of Peter Jackson's films, and how they tend to be drawn out and include many panoramic shots, you really can see The Hobbit is no different. HOWEVER, Jackson is extremely passionate about following the marvelous book (at least for now). He tied in the songs/poems perfectly, and the fact that he hints at Smaug but never really shows him, is genius. I do not believe the film had overacting; however the inclusion of Radagast was not necessary (since he is only referred to in The Hobbit, and has only a small part in The Fellowship of the Ring). Nor did I like how the ending was tainted with cheesiness; it was as if Jackson had stacked one of the best cakes and now the top was covered in cheese instead of icing. That being said I did feel that Jackson, given his style and the commonalities of his films, did The Hobbit justice. The soundtrack was faithful to the films, the acting (overall) was good, and I do feel like this it was (always will be) an unexpected pleasure when watching the films in the following films. Also, look at it this way; given the Rankin Bass cartoon, this is most likely the only real film trilogy that will do the book justice, so take it or leave it folks.
B00881VLCE|2.0|I am undecided about this puzzle.  When I tried to by extra puzzles, I was charged but the puzzles did not load.  I had to purchase the cake puzzle twice for it to down load.  I purchased the season puzzle it did not load either.. How can I get my puzzle that I paid for.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|Reading this book made me realize that these brave men are putting their lives on the line everyday for us and that they are not getting the full recognization that they deserve. I'm proud that my Dad and my husband were part of the Navy in WW 2 and Vietnam. My Dad too was a disabled veteran and he loved his service times as well as Chris. Chris was a remarkable American and he will be missed by many people, but we will nevertheless never know what other remarkabled things he might have been able to do with his life due to his early demise. Thankfully we have this book to let us peak into a world we will never be able to sample.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|The follow up of the Fall of Giants I can´t wait for the third book and sorry that it will all end then
B008220DGE|4.0|Joaquin Phoenix is the main reason I watched this movie. It's his first serious acting role since his whole rap documentary hoax I'm Still Here. (I thought I'm Still Here was pretty ballsy.) And no regrets because Joaquin blew me away. People don't realize his acting depth. Honestly you have to go into this movie with an open mind and free time because it's slower paced. Philip Seymour Hoffman's acting was really phenomenal and passionate as well. This movie is definitely an acquired taste.<br /><br />Go into this movie with the acting in mind, not so much the plot or the cinematography or visuals.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follett at his best, intrigue, detail, linked to history all add up to a fascinating and nearly impossible to put down book

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The Percy Jackson series was basically my childhood. I read the first book in 6th grade, and was amazed. It was funny because I read every book around the same age Percy was. Now, with the new Heroes of Olympus series, I got sooo excited!!! :) Mark of Athena is amazing, and it left me wanting more of course. I can't wait for the next book!!! (Oh I like reading on the kindle fire because i can highlight a word that I don't know, and it shows the definition.)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow, wow, wow... This book was amazing. Riveting, heart-wrenching, and not something you can put down. Plan to sit and read until it's done...

B00985E3UG|1.0|I listened to the author and a few sycophants extolling the worth of this book on a TV show and while doing so they listed innumerable propagandized ideas about food, and a clear misunderstanding of what propels a business, and it is definitely not a conspiracy<br />An investigating journalist should at least understand that to sell the goods one makes, the product must be desirable to the buyers. For the food business this means making the product palatable. Making food taste like broccoli is not likely to give most buyers any incentive to buy. That sugar, salt, and fat are desirable in foods by enhancing their taste and putting the problem of an obese population on the food companies is really forgetting those responsible, the people who overeat. Though there are theories that there are both good and bad calories one forgets that calories are a measure of heat output measured in a specific way. Eat or drink too many calories and you gain weight, and the calories can be candy or raw vegetables.<br />It is so easy to decide these three items are the cause of all our troubles, witness the news items of recent decades, but because of the ease at which they are demonized, this demonization has become an urban myth, in most cases not supported by any provable evidence.However it does make for good conspiracy writing and so becomes the source of income for a company of pitchmen.

B000ZECQ08|5.0|Somehow I had missed this movie!  The movie was great, like all the others, and filled in a lot of questions.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I read the books a few years ago and wanted to have a digital copy. As the subject stated, it is the classic. Just as Tolkien can be thought of as the base of all fantasy novels and role-playing games, this book is the basis of all stories involving vampires. Dracula is a complex, non-soap opera, but evil, as a vampire should be. The resent flood of teenage friendly blood suckers is just sad. This is the way that they should be presented. A must read for any one who likes horror or fantasy.
B0097UGXFK|5.0|I read the book and the movie was quite close to the plot of the book.  The acting was very good and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.
0307388719|4.0|I enjoyed the book, as I do all books about Churchill. And I always enjoy and appreciate Max Hastings research and writing. The result was less than expected given the subject matter and the author's considerable stature.

B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Just another part of media and government propaganda. Presenting people in positions of power that rarely exist in reality. Wanting to show how it should but is not. Don't try to brainwash me. I resent it.
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|Hundreds of excellent reviews precede mine on this well-received British TV series.  Nevertheless... (SPOILERS ahead)<br /><br />*** Update, 31 Mar 13: Having spent the entire weekend watching every single Downton Abbey episode, I'll repeat what I said originally -- that Season Three is mostly a disappointing drag.  Really, does ANY family ever have this many tragedies befall them in the course of only a few years? None that I know of....<br /><br />Deep in Season 3 we see the almost inevitable emergence of 21st Century &quot;political correctness&quot; in the handling of the topic of overt male-on-male homosexuality.  Until fairly recently, these practices were considered so disgusting and abhorrent that they were never even mentioned in mainstream &quot;ordinary&quot; society -- much less in aristocratic circles in Great Britain.  Moreover, such practices were blatantly forbidden by force of law! But, somehow, in Season 3 of Downton Abbey, suddenly, it becomes OK?  Revisionism masquerading as actual history cheapens the whole franchise and reduces it to the level of predictable, &quot;PC&quot; rubbish.  And, from what I understand in browsing the internet on what may emerge in Season 4, there is likely to be another big dose of the same general kind of revisionism.  Too bad... until this unfortunate development, I was enjoying the series a lot!<br /><br />Also, in Season 3, it is evident that those who script Downton are exercising a morbid fascination with macabre tragedy on a scale that defies the laws of probability in order to infuse inordinately large doses of misfortune into the story, and, to take swipes at the pompous ostentation of the English upper-classes at this time in history.  One of his Lordship's daughters dies immediately after childbirth (after the malfeasance of a physician who is also a member of the &quot;peerage&quot;), and then this tragedy is followed in three episodes by one of his Lordship's sons-in-law being killed in a car wreck whilstdriving home from seeing his new-born son and wife in the hospital??  A BIT too much, methinks.  At this rate, one would expect the next episode to conclude with an asteroid landing right on top of Downton Abbey itself, leveling the place and killing them all!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|the game is very cool my horse is cool the graphics are very cool is cool in every single way
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|this book was amazing! i couldn't put it down! it was probably one of the best books ive ever read!
B00005LC4B|5.0|One, truly terrifying film, is 'Cape Fear.' In which a convicted criminal, Max Cady, played by DeNiro, blames his lawyer, Sam Bowden, played by Nick Nolte, for a 14-year prison sentence. Rape, the charge. Cady's issue, with his defense lawyer? Who actually pleaded his client to a lesser charge in his rape case? The fact that Bowden, by his own admission, 'buried' (did not reveal in court) a report, indicating Cady's last victim had been, 'promiscuous.' A report which, in Cady's estimation, would have saved him from nearly a decade-and-a-half's worth of incarceration.<br /><br />A 'good reason,' for revenge, indeed.<br /><br />Cady goes to great lengths to insure his vengeance is realized. Harassing Bowden, his wife, and his 15-year old daughter. Following them in public, at restaurants, and the like. Sitting atop a wall, that borders their property. Staring. At night. I won't tell you in what other ways, as such details, expertly handled by director Scorsese, make up 'half the fun' of the film. DeNiro: Very convincing, as the vengeful, predatory criminal. Nolte: Equally good, as his prey. Dialogue throughout the film: Razor-sharp, credible. With Jessica Lange as Nolte's wife, and Juliette Lewis as his daughter. Both, with convincing performances as well. Scorsese's direction, generally-speaking? Excellent. Good, minimalistic camera-work. A soundtrack mirroring the disturbing, staccato, 'Psycho'-like score used in the original, black and white version of the film, circa 1962. And an overall premise, deeply disturbing; from writer John D. MacDonald, author of the book version which predated the film. His book, originally titled, 'The Executioners.'<br /><br />What makes the premise of the story so terrifying? It's a simple tale of revenge, after all. Well, it is HIGHLY believable, I'd say, to start. And transmits the feeling, in the case of this film version, to the viewer, that something like this truly, 'could happen.' In fact, you may well find yourself - as you become so deeply involved in the characters' fears and motivations throughout the story - forgetting that you're watching, 'actors act.' This is what happened to me while watching. And I'll tell you, as a 'seasoned,' film viewer, writer, editor of content: That rarely happens anymore. To myself, anyway. I'm normally quite cognizant of fact that I'm viewing DeNiro, for example, acting a part. Or any other actor, for that matter. Not in this case. I thought of him as the vengeance-filled, ex-convict Cady, until the film's final frame. 'Ditto,' with regard to the other characters, here. That's how convincing, is the direction, acting, strength of plot, story-line.<br /><br />Excellent work, from all involved. To put it mildly. Starting with MacDonald's original premise.<br /><br />What else, makes it work so well? I believe, the basic story, theme, hearkens back to one of the most primal, basic instincts known to Man. That of seeking to right, a perceived wrong. And going to 'whatever lengths necessary,' to see that done. Not that Cady's plight herein is one with which you'll feel any empathy. Quite the contrary, in all likelihood. Yet his motivation is one that calls to that within Man, which shall NOT accept a wrong done him, without a corresponding reaction.  A reaction with which any man, can likely identify.<br /><br />Ah yes: Cady is jealous of Bowden's wife and child, as well. His comfortable, family life. As his own daughter, he claims, doesn't, due to his incarceration, 'even know me.' I can tell you this detail, without spoiling the, 'fun.' Add this jealousy to the already compelling, 'plot of vengeance?' As well as Bowden's primal instinct to protect his loved ones from a deeply frightening, yet believable, danger? What have you got? A horrific, compelling conflict. One which likely hearkens back to among the most ancient such, known.<br /><br />I should probably mention as well, this: There is a thematic, moral subtext to the film. And one which differs fromthat evident in the '62 version. This, that the Bowden character, again by his own admission, DID violate his civic duty. By NOT revealing a report that may well have had a positive impact upon his defense of Cady. So Cady feels well-justified in quoting Biblical Scripture, accusing his target of being a traitor to Man, and to God. And, generally, behaving as if his rape of a woman was NOT the primary issue in his case. Rather, as he sees it, he has been wronged by a corrupt defender of his case. And THAT is his primary concern, and motivation, throughout. Bowden DOES express guilt, remorse, for his action. For his 'burying' of said report. Does his remorse extend to include any empathy for Cady? No. Not by a 'long shot.' Yet it does add an intriguing element and overall thematic depth - that of, perhaps, 'be careful who you wrong' - to this version, NOT contained in the original '62 film.<br /><br />Finally: Juliette Lewis' character, Bowden's daughter. Shes' got more than a few, truly terrifying scenes with DeNiro's Cady. Who creates such an affront, and inflicts such a violent terror upon another, girl-friend of her father's, JUST BEFORE meeting the young girl - that when he finally does, in person... 'Tis NOT easy to watch, I can tell you. Not, without feeling a cold, sense of dread, 'percolate,' through your veins. That dread, emanating from what he MIGHT, 'do to this victim.' Based upon, his previous. Scary indeed. At a deep, nervous-system level, I tell you.<br /><br />End of film: The resolution to conflict? Realistically-shot. With a final 'showdown,' on a wet, stormy night. Upon a raging, river. With boat, unmanned, headed into 'unprotected waters.' And two primary characters, finally meeting to 'settle score.' Riveting, suspenseful stuff. Altogether? An enjoyable, frightening, satisfying film. With regard to direction. Acting. Story-line. Plot. And to, theme. Which might be, were I compelled to 'boil it down,' to a sentence or two: Watch who you wrong. Hecould be...<br /><br />'Your worst nightmare.'<br /><br />***Or, as the tale is told from Juliette Lewis' (who remarks, 'still, our lives will never be the same before he came') point of view, who has just been exposed to that which shall mark her character forever: 'Innocence, shattered.'<br /><br />Jeff Sekerak

B00BHMETKC|2.0|the show was good but because the video kept freezing and reloading we did not get to fully enjoy it. Very disappointing.

B00274EYKY|5.0|I thought this movie would just be about wrestling with so-so acting.  It was an excellent story and the acting was excellent.
B005XI9456|4.0|This is a great holiday album. I specifically bought it for the song Under the Mistletoe but found that all of the songs are really catchy and fun it really puts you into the holiday spirit using pop beats and rhythms. Of course it helps to be a Justin Bieber fan!

0441172717|4.0|I seriously can't believe that the Kindle version is more expensive than the paperback, especially with all the Kindle conversion complaints. Its VERY sad!!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book kept me interested enough to want to continue reading it, even on nights that I was exhausted.  I'm currently working in an area that involves criminal court cases and Defending Jacob held true to what I know about homicide trial processes.  Although I am not a parent, the story line, which is from the point of view of the father of a teen-age boy, is also believable.  With just enough unexpected twists here and there to keep me interested, I liked it and would recommend the book to others.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book, but in different times of the book I wanted to cry my eyes out. Read this book! Then you will understand the true meaning of love, hate, and grief.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Fun flick but I still think the Sean Connery 007s were the best. Hated to see &#34;M&#34; leave the series.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I missed out early on watching the series so early in season three, I purchased the whole set - seasons one and two and then a separate purchase of season three.  Additional program segments in dvd set very nice and well worth the purchase price.  A good value!
B00BHMF578|5.0|You know the outcome but the story keeps you &#34;on the edge of your seat&#34;. Well worth seeing and easy to stream.

B000VMFDW2|5.0|I've read several accounts of the war in the Pacific. This is a well written first hand account of  the the brutal reality of war by a participating marine private who survived only by pure luck. His detailed account of what he saw is not for the faint of heart.<br />I would recommend this to anyone wanting to understand what the marines actually did in the battles for the capture of the Palau islands.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that the subway suffers world tour is amazing! Maby they should make a subway station in space after the world tour. They could even let you collect anti gravity boots that make you hover and.if you double swipe up then you could float above sub-rockets

B000BTJDGC|5.0|I love horror, this movie was great.  I've seen it before, and I don't usually buy DVD's because I never watch them again, but this movie was creepy enough to keep around for rainy dark days.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I have attempted to write this review a few times, and erased it three times realizing I am having a hard time trying to tell all of you what this book really means to me, and maybe what it could mean for you.<br /><br />I should probably tell you that I am 37 and I experienced high school the same years Charlie did, who is of course the main character of the story...the Wallflower.  In some ways I don't really think it matters if you're younger, the story is still relevant, just as Catcher in the Rye is still relevant in some ways.  The author, told through the voice of Charlie, just gets that core experience of being a teenager.  Not the kind of teenager seen through the eyes of parents or even in movies like Mean Girls or Clueless, which are fun, but don't paint the other side that I remember very well in my experiences.<br /><br />People my age will remember what it was like to get a mixed tape made for you, or making it for someone else.  It's different than sharing a playlist on an mp3 player or iphone or the like.  The work that is put into it, and listening to the songs while you are recording them, and even decorating the cover in some creative way.  It's an experience and a very personal gift.  He got that teenagers spoke through music.  Even in high school I liked The Beatles and a friend of mine was really into The Doors.  I remember having philosophical type discussions and my friend saying that her favorite line in The Breakfast Club was &#34;When you grow up your heart dies&#34; and that she didn't want that to happen to her or to us.<br /><br />I never forgot that moment, and this author got that part of our teenage years and I love him for it and for creating Charlie.<br /><br />I think sometimes people forget that teenagers do think about some heavy stuff that they don't talk to their parents about.  Because parents, although they were once teenagers too have forgotten and they have a new role now and life just gave them new responsibilities and expectations they have to fulfill.  I just remember trying to find my place in the world and who I was.  I remember writing really dark poetry and dreaming dreams of what life could be and that I will never be &#34;grown up&#34; where people sit in bars and talk about the good ol' days and tell us how lucky we are and what they could've been.<br /><br />This story was just flat out honest and beautiful and really captures what I remember of being a teenager.  It was a bit different for me with people and parties, but the core of it basically the same.  They are memories I won't forget and friendships I feel blessed to have experienced...and still friends with a few to this day.  Which is rare.<br /><br />I don't want to go back to that time, but I can appreciate it for what it was, and I knew exactly what he meant when Charlie said &#34;I felt infinite.&#34;
B007R41E8O|2.0|Several times during play it restarted and I had to start over..I wouldn't recommend this game. It was okay but not good if you discount the restarting and freezing
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The book goes into more detail than the movie (like always) but it's the added background you get about Katniss, Gale, and the rest of the characters in district 12 that make this an excellent complement to the movie. I can't wait to see how they tackle &#34;Catching Fire&#34; in the next movie.
B000FBJF6Y|5.0|Alexander McCall Smith  just writes with genius about Africa and it's people. After reading several of his No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency books,  I'm going back and reading them again, this time in order. Even better the second time around!

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I read this book because it was my book clubs choice. It is an interesting look at a teenage girl's journey while living with cancer. The characters she encounters make it a great story!
0345803507|3.0|In the last book of the series it seems E.L. James crammed 2 books into one. Pretty good, but not the best of the series.

B0036SUQWA|5.0|They had the courage to reveal military secrets that I knew existed from the 70s. It is a well made documentary: I would not even call it a movie. well done. The actors were very good.
B008EKOO46|5.0|Our book club picked this because we enjoyed previous Diamond books.<br />Chapter 2 was slow at first because of the details but comparing conflict resolutions between small groups and our own large country courts was informative because I learned the pluses and minuses in both systems.<br />Chapters 3 and 4 deal with war and one idea surprised me. I don't want to let the surprise out but I learned why small societies sometimes were happy when they were part of a country being colonized. The other big surprise were how we support wars and what percentage of the populations get killed in wars. Excellent chapters.<br />I am looking forward to the chapter dealing with religions. I have always been curious why we create them and then why do we put up with them. Are religions just something we men create to control women?
B002QRWJA4|5.0|a great movie  great visual delight to watch and hear. I recommend this  movie! The costumes are amazing as well as the locations

1593272839|3.0|\\"Learn You a Haskell\\" actually teaches two different subjects -- distinct but related -- under the same cover: 1) the Haskell programming language, a strong and flexible, purely functional computer language, and 2), an introduction to Monads and their ilk. These mathematical abstractions that help model behaviors of real-life systems, and are used often in Haskell programming. The book excels in the first part, moving painlessly through most language features, with clear descriptions and few illustrative examples. However, once you reach the Monad chapters, you may feel you've hit a bit of a snag.<br /><br />This is where I felt the book was at its weakest. It attempts to use the same teaching mechanics from the first ten chapters, but the subject matter imposes a steeper assimilation curve and demands a more patient treatment (not to mention a few practice exercises and least a superficial introduction to using monads as modeling tools).<br /><br />While \\"Learn You a Haskell\\" remains a decent introductory book (and though it pretends to be nothing more than this), I felt that it tried to span some complex subjects which it treated too casually. Some of the material appears to be a little outdated as well. These are the reasons why I'm taking two stars.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Ong this game is awesome idk y it is rated guidence suggested bc it doesnt have anything bad in it soooo yea
B007L5GDGW|3.0|I feel the difficulty level in the beginning pushes players away because there is no real sense of progress. Maybe slow it down in the beginning and build speed.<br /><br /> I like the concept and I think you should work at it more.  Maybe add elements to make it more interesting, like adding musical instruments so that when you hit them is adds that instrument to the cord or something.  Or items that slow you down.<br /><br />The graphics are beautiful.<br /><br />Also.....you spelled challenger wrong.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Its really awsome and fun so im gunna keep playing my game or app wat ever its called. Hey this isnt working

B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing this game when I'm bored and don't feel like delving into  a new book. And it keeps me sharp. Sometimes playing a game before going to bed helps me sleep a little better.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great book. Would recommend it to my friends and family. Can't wait to read the next two books in the series
0316228532|5.0|I loved Bonfire of the Vanities and A Man in Full. The Casual Vacancy reminds me more of these two Wolfe novels than of the Harry Potter series. Lots of characters (OK, Harry Potter has that too), lots of realistic social issues, and a sharp focus on both the petty and grand social issues that confront all of us. No fantasy, but a thought-provoking, moving story.
B0093H8H8I|5.0|This went into a mini PC (Antec Mini-ITX Case ISK110 case). Power usage on average 20 - 30 W with CPU temp &#60; 30 degrees C with stock CPU cooler. No graphics drivers to install or tweak. The 3D graphics acceleration worked much better than the Nvidia Ion2 system it replaced just minus the hassles of proprietary drivers.
030758836X|5.0|Well, I didn't exactly have LOW expectations of this book..... but since my under-30 daughter recommended it, I had my doubts. Was I mistaken! This is one of the best books I have read in the past year. Flynn is a master of words and their use to create maximum confusion...and then ultimate understanding... in the mind of the reader. He is a master of describing human frailty while never detouring from his fascinating, gripping narrative....Tsareena
B001ECQ75A|5.0|This is another great DVD for long journeys in the car.  It is not easy to find a 'new' DVD that will captivate our grandsons. They thoroughly enjoy this.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|This short book presents four simple guidelines to live by.  While religion is touched upon, religion is not the basis for these guidelines.  I recommend it for anyone who takes life seriously and is never too old to learn.
B009GEAWOU|5.0|Last 2 years had a bit more filler.  But still enough high quality writing and material that most other shows pale in comparison.  One day I hope to learn about the pineapple.  Next season we see Ted take his last cigarette.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Definitely  added to the holiday must see list. Just love everything about it !!! Goes straight to the heart and soul !!
B006LSZECO|1.0|Much too slow.  Took me forever to get 'into' the book.  I wanted to toss it so many times but hate wasting money so I continued to read.  I would never recommend it.  The ending was....well.. it had no ending.  A waste of my time.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|I saw the original BBC version, and loved it.  And I am equally in love with this American version.  I eagerly anticipate its release to DVD, as I intend to purchase and watch repeatedly. Hurry up and release please!!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app is very convenient.  The only problem I have with it is that the print is too small.  I know how to make it larger, but I would still rather view my Facebook online.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was suspenseful, sexual and great series from the first book.  It is defiantly a must read. Can't wait for the next book.
6305546797|5.0|I love Halloween.  The original two movies were two of the best horror movies ever (in my opinion).  They really did not go overboard on the violence.  Yes there was blood and you saw people being stabbed and choked etc, but unlike the horror movies of today where they go overboard on the gore, the goal of these movies were to scare you before the actual death scenes so they had a much larger effect.  The movie was as much suspense as it was horror.  Jamie Lee Curtis did a great job as Laurie Strode, and of course Donald Pleasence was wonderful as Doctor Loomis.  Their characters really had to drive the story, and although they only had one scene together they did that very well.<br /><br />While Michael Myers was set up as the indestructible killer in Halloween, unlike the later sequels he still seemed somewhat human.  He was a regular sized guy who could be hurt, but not killed easily.  I believe John Carpenter has said the intent was for Michael to really die at the end of Halloween 2, and never make it into the Jason/Freddy category where they just keep coming back.  I think this version of Michael is much more effective and scarier than the supernatural version you got years later.<br /><br />The version of the movie I am reviewing (the limited edition dvd) contains both the original theatrical version and the extended version with the scenes from the TV version mixed in.  Because the movie had to be edited to show on tv, they filled it in with footage shot during the filming of Halloween 2.  The extended version is the unedited version of the movie, plus the TV shots edited into it.  While I do not think they add too much to the story, and even slightly spoil the revelation in Halloween 2, they do help flesh out Loomis' character and why he feels the way he does about Michael Myers.<br /><br />Chances are if you are a fan of horror movies you already own some version of Halloween.  If not, definitely give it a look.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|awesome movie my little ones loved the movie now we have bought our little ones a whole bunch of brave toys so they could play out the movie
1558908382|4.0|The story line of the movie is pretty simple. A hitman is returning to his hometown for his 10 year (really should be 15 year) high school reunion, mainly to reunite with the girl he ditched on prom night when he ran off and joined the army.  Along the way he has to avoid rival hitmen and federal agents while trying to act \\"normal\\" in front of his old classmates.<br /><br />It is a very dark comedy, and as such not everyone will enjoy the humor.  There are no really laugh out loud funny jokes in this, so if that is the only kind of comedy you like then you should probably skip this.  If however you like shows and movies with a more offbeat and even warped sense of humor, then this is worth giving  try.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this keyboard - especially with the addition of the flow option! I don't use flow all the time, but love having the option.  After you use SwiftKey for a while, it learns your speech patterns so well that you rarely have to enter more than the first letter of any word! I can't recommend it enough -  well worth the nominal fee.  I've been a fan for almost 4 years now!
B006O6F932|4.0|My daughter really likes this, it's neat that it folds up so compactly, however it's not very durable.  We have to be very careful having it out around her 3 year old brother.  He could completely destroy this thing in less than a minute!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is awesome. Much better then Eden. This is money well spent! I have Minecraft PE for my iPod and my kindle!
B007REV4YI|5.0|I am a huge 007 fan. I loved this new addition and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. It gets a little more classic Bond, but keeps the Daniel Craig rawness. Great fight scenes and effects are fantastic. Javier Bardem was one of the best villains ever.
1608871452|1.0|I was so excited to get this. Wen I picked up the box it was really light. Upon opening I realized they sent me a tv antenna. It's disappointing to see such a reputable company make such a big mistake. There wasn't even a packing slip. Sending this antenna back for a refund and going to barnes and noble
1400067820|4.0|Reading this book change my way of reflecting on the world. It was great that Taleb named names regarding some of the bad behavior that has gone on to long in the banking industry and for which the US taxpayer is still on the hook. His idea that a person leaving government for the private sector should not be able to earn more than the highest paid civil servant is one that should be implemented to prevent further conflicts of interest.

B000002OOY|5.0|Even though this soundtrack is over 10 years old, I was easily able to find it on Amazon. Contains instrumental music from the first movie. I would recommend this CD to anyone who loves Jurassic Park. This would also make a good CD for road trips!
0061726834|5.0|I loved this book!  I finished it in two days; I couldn't put it down.  If you like the Hunger games, or the Twilight books, this book is for you!  It was absolutely awesome!  The writing was great and the character development was flawless.  This is one of my favorites.  You will enjoy it, but take your time with it becuase you'll be sad when it's over.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|I give this movie 5 stars! Very funny, good comedy pair. Kristen Wiig is hilarious, as always. Amazon recommended this movie based on past purchases (i.e. Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz)
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|A great movie. Avoided all the Hollywood cliches.  Love Denzel Washington. What a credible acting job.  A interesting take on the hero story.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was very good. I loved the story and the main character/narrator. Very sad, but still funny at times and not too heavy.

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game.  I am however really upset that since the new update I can't open my Facebook Farm.  I have many gems and Dragon cash that I paid for and cannot use.  SO for now do not log in to back up your game on Facebook.

I have taken them apart months after reparing them just to check the consistancy of the paste and it looks just as good as the day I put it together. I would reccomend this to anyone who is building a computer or just installing a new processor. other compounds get hard, but this doesent, it keeps its consistancy. so the heat transfere from the processor to the heat sink is great.thanx for making a great product.

B00AJLHUWQ|5.0|In the old days of vinyl , often times each side of an LP had it's own mood. Springsteen's &#34;Born To Run&#34; side two was a different mood than side one. Many other examples could be sited.<br />&#34;Shrine of New Generation Slaves&#34; is such a recording. Although I appreciate the first part of this disc , the second part is what blew me away. There is only one Riverside disc that I don't like , and that is only a matter of personal choice.<br />At 53 , I like my prog to be a little more melodic and majestic , therefore I prefer  the &#34;second side &#34; of this to be the best portion. If you are from &#34;the other camp&#34; you still won't be disappointed. Great music is great music !
B001NLKWLW|4.0|A lot of suspense makes it as interesting to read as a true mystery and might deserve a 5 rating.  However, too much of the secret is revealed  from the omniscient author's knowledge of the past and not enough from the search of the present day characters.  The two are intermingled and confusing.  Just the same, it makes a very exciting read.
1932735410|5.0|I am not a project manager, I work in sales.  I thought that project management would be a great area to learn as a plan \\"B\\"!  I didn't realize how challenging studying for the PMP exam would actually be.  I read the PMBOK, but it was very hard for me to retain the information.  I heard about Rita's book so I went on Amazon and I read all the reviews.  Everyone was right, this book is amazing.  After reading Rita's book (I READ IT 3 TIMES) and completing her questions at the end of the chapter, I felt better about taking the exam.  What also helped me was the 200 question pocket PMP exam book of questions that is offered on her website.  The questions are taken from her PMP simulation exam. The pocket PMP exam book was only $20.  It was a great review of the types of questions on the exam.  I reviewed those questions over and over and figured out why I got certain answers incorrect.  Do not get me wrong, it took me time to really understand how the questions are structure and how think the way PMI wants you to think to pass the exam.  I studied for the exam for about 4 months before passing it.  There is a technique to studying and passing the exam.  Rita's questions in the pocket pmp exam book are very simular to the exam.  If you can afford it, I would recommend purchasing the stimulation exam that Rita's offers.  That will prepare you for the exam and the stress of taking a test under the time pressure.  You do have to study.  You will not pass this exam if you don't.  I PASSED MY PMP EXAM ON DECEMBER 9TH 2012!
1451695195|5.0|I think it is hard to exaggerate the importance of this book (or Alexander's fine reading of it on CDs).  In the whole field of &#34;near-death experiences&#34; the objections to the reality of the experience have always boiled down to the idea that the experience was taking place in THIS world, not another one that had actually been entered by the person having the experience (i.e. there are no such other worlds; this one is all there is).  The argument has always been that the individual's brain created the experience, whether through a recovered memory, a crossed wire, or whatever.  But all of these explanations require some level of higher brain activity, and in this case there was none; Alexander's higher brain functions were all flat lined (and they were being monitored by experts).  This would indeed seem to be &#34;proof of heaven&#34; or at least of the reality of other worlds that can be visited in an &#34;out-of-body&#34; experience (and/or entered into after we leave this world).  And methinks this kind of context for our normal life is just what we need at a time of such turmoil in our normal living.

B00979CS50|3.0|A reunion of the likes of the iconic Neil Young and Crazy Horse is normally a cause for celebration. From their first album together, \\"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere,\\" to \\"Zuma\\" and \\"Ragged Glory,\\" this combination has been responsible for many of rock and roll's extrodinary moments. Even without the incredibly talented former Crazy Horse lead guitarist Danny Whitten (who died in November of 1972 from an overdose of valium and alcohol, as he was trying to kick a heroin habit), Crazy Horse has always been Neil's quintessential back-up band. Also, recall that two third's of Crazy Horse (the rhythm section of Ralph Molina on drums and Billy Talbot on bass) were instrumental in making Neil's 2003 underappreciated album \\"Greendale\\" in 2003 so memorable.<br /><br />\\"Psychedelic Pill\\" turns out to be an uneven effort. However, since Neil Young is the songwriter and lyricist, you can't blame Messers. Sampedro, Molina, and Talbot for the shortcomings of this collection, which stems largely from many unmemorable tunes. However, Neil Young is even interesting in his less than stellar efforts, and so it is here. His unique lead guitar solos are instantly recognizable, and despite not being a virtuoso musician, his writing skills, plaintive voice, and the visceral impact of his aural assualt when he is on target has rightly made him a legend in the industry.<br /><br />No, you are not going to come across songs as memorable as \\"Cinammon Girl,\\" \\"Down by the River,\\" \\"Cortez the Killer\\" or \\"Ordinary People\\" in this collection, but there's enough to maintain some interest with \\"Ramada Inn,\\" \\"Twisted Road,\\" and \\"Walk Like a Giant.\\" Regrettably, the ennui is palpable in the other tunes. For instance, the first track is the 26 minute \\"Drifting Back,\\" seems to be an elongated and enormous piece of sonic wallpaper, as are four other songs, outside of three mentioned above, that comprise the balance of this effort.<br /><br />You can't argue with the amount of music Neil offers with thisalbum. It clocks in at over 85 minutes, and even on CD, two discs are needed (a \\"red book\\" CD can contain, at maximum, about 80 minutes of music, versus about 47 for a vinyl LP). However, much of the material here is largely unmemorable. Also, the production is muddled. I find that ironic for a musician who is normally very protective of offering well recorded albums to his fans. Compare \\"Psychedelic Pill\\" with \\"Greendale,\\" and you'll immediately hear the difference of a well recorded album and this one. Admittedly, I'm listening to this album on a high-end audio system, but in \\"Greendale,\\" instruments have genuine body, and you can place them on a stage in terms of location. The dynamics are excellent, and Neil's voice is vividly portrayed. This is not the case with \\"Psychedelic Pill.\\" This is doubly interesting because Neil Young (with John Ranlon and Mark Humphreys) is listed as a producer.<br /><br />So where does this effort fit in the Neil Young canon? Personally, I do not find is a as egregious as many reviewers here have. However, it certainly isn't one of his classic albums. If you are enamored with Frank \\"Pancho\\" Sampedro, Ralph Molina, and Billy Talbot playing with Neil, you should acquire this album. But the material simply doesn't stand up to many earlier pairings of Crazy Horse and Young. This may not be an album you play over and over again, but it is certainly superior to much of the drivel that is being relaesed these days.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|i had a lot of down time that was just a few minutes at a time and got this awesome app to have something to do, i love the variety of the Sudoku levels.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Good book but hard to follow the story line sometimes. Very realistic topic set in present day. I recommend this book to others.
B00BHMETKC|2.0|I rented this believing it'd be like The Town + the high reviews...  I was left sleepy and terribly disappointed.<br /><br />The whole 'based on a true story' angle is cool but the interpretation for film was terrible. The movie did a poor job suspending my belief and the plot was too predictable. No real excitement, no action, just a BLAND attempt by hollywood to make a declassified government Operation into a movie.
B008BGNMZU|4.0|have everything by fourplay.  some are better than others but still great.  will listen to it more with or as time goes by.
B000KJU1HI|1.0|I was VERY disappointed with the production quality.  Most of the time I could not understand the words to the songs or what was being said by the people.  Iwas expecting early taping quality, but I still expected to get some good footage of the concerts and songs. I have yet to get thru the entire dvd....I just can not endure it.
B0031RAOVY|1.0|I've seen this movie several times and I love it.  Hachi is an amazing dog.  I ordered this dvd for my son who had a dog<br />like this.  I know he and his wife will enjoy it.
0385474547|5.0|My sister had this book some years back, and I had started to read it, but, I lost it during Hurricane Katrina. For whatever reason, the book stayed in my mind for years. So, when I saw it on Amazon at this price, I was like, now is the time! I received the book within 5 days of my order! I appreciate Amazon and the seller!
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|Although a decent film, nothing about this movie says James Bond. There were no new gadgets or clever plot twists. Disappointing.
0060764899|3.0|I love CS Lewis, but, for whatever reason, I couldn't get into this book. It was well-written and whatnot, I guess I was never into the whole fantasy world thing.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Ben Affleck took his time to do the research to make it as much like the real event. I was sitting on the edge of my seat. This is a fantastic movie about two countries came together to rescue 6 American's from Iran and it really makes you feel the intensity, the horror, and genius of the plan of the CIA!!!
030758836X|5.0|At last, I've read Gone Girl and I see what all the buzz is about.  I absolutely couldn't put it down. Masterfully manipulating. Wonderfully complex characters.  Plot twists that will keep you off guard until the very end.  Be sure you don't have to get up early the next morning once you start it!  It's a page-turner!
B007THA4FI|3.0|The book had a slow start. There were some interesting characters but almost too many. It was difficult to keep them straight. About halfway through the book the story took on some energy and there was some good character development and a few surprises which I liked.  The F word was overdone.
1616550414|5.0|Great item, would recommend to any fan. A must have item for any legend of zelda fan. Received on time.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed watching the Second Season of Game of Thrones.  While all of the cast does fine work, Peter Dinklage as Tyrion is particularly outstanding.  I'm not sure I would enjoy the series as much if I had not read all of the books in the series.  The shows have a limited time to tell the many stories and I believe that having the background allows me to fill in the blanks and make the series that much better.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Suzanne Collins' world is always changing. Catching Fire is only 1 of the changes. Pretty nice book!!! Also nice job of Collins, by the final that takes another level of being a rebel in District 12
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Could use more breeds of horses and more options on training like barrel racing. But still it's a fun game for everyone.
B008JIFJ4W|5.0|I enjoy Passion Pit's music and getting a good deal on music from Amazon makes it even better! Thank you!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This was a great follow-up of the first one. Keeps you on your toes wondering what will happen next. I'm excited to start the  next one!
B009B53LA6|5.0|I love No Doubt and couldn't be more excited to hear that they were coming out with a new album!
B002GHHHKQ|5.0|A great look at belief from both a religious and scientific perspective. A beautiful movie.<br /><br />Quality of the DVD was good. Came in a hard case.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|To me, this is one of Quentin's best movies. It's highlights inculde it's magnificent visual qualities, suspenseful and shocking character scenarios, as well as extremely dynamic and intense dialogue.Definitely worth watching.
B008OTTRXU|5.0|I bought this for nephew on Christmas. Thought it was because of the &#34;Call Me Maybe&#34; fad, and I thought he would be tired. Turns out he loved every track, so did I. Each song is pretty catchy and shows that Carly could more than a one-hit wonder. Worth every cent.
B000L53D4O|3.0|I bought this for my grandson to help him to walk. He didn't like it too much. It's sitting. He doesn't play with it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|An absolutely wonderful story. I laughed and cried and it made me look within myself. This should be required reading for all middle school children as well as adults. If we all would be a little kinder to each other.......
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|This book was hard to put down!  The story was heart wrenching.  The relationships of the characters was great.  The characters reactions to the tragedy were so realistic.  I have heard that Jodi Picoult is a great author.  I will definitely read more from this author!
B0009A40ES|5.0|Such a great thriller that has more subliminal undertones and hints that you will have a different view on the ending than the other people in the room!
B004J4WLPU|5.0|The characters are compelling, the format is creative, the description of grieving is beautifully and skillfully done and the drama is intense!
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Great cast and acting in a nail biter drama. I gave it 4 stars because, as engaging as the film is, it is not a film that I would watch again ( which is my cut point for 5 stars).<br />Maybe Affleck uses Argo to take a shot at Hollywood's pandering to often infantile/juvenile tastes rather than making serious films--like Argo. There are many great comic relief lines, particularly the Hollywood bashing lines from the characters played by Arkin and Goodman.  For example, listen for Goodman's character stating that the intended audience for a SciFi movie will not like it, and then identifying the intended audience.  Great fun in an escape film bashing escapism!
B00BHMF578|5.0|Really suspenseful throughout the entire movie.  There's a good reason it was named Best Picture. Would recommend it to anyone.
B004KKYX9K|5.0|Another great read from Jodi Picoult.  Recommended to those who enjoy a realistic drama.  A great unexpected ending as always.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|If you you play a lot of lan like i do, then this is the best and safeste way to take your xbox 360 or playstation 3 on the go.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is the best calculator for my Kindle Fire! It is basic but has everything I need.  The big numbers are a PLUS.
B0062OCNAI|3.0|Not as good as her first, Sister, but entertaining. Very touching and highlights the devotion and love parents have for their children.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|Even having an idea of what was going to happen, I still didn't catch any of the clues!  Definitely worth the read, it will keep you entertained to the end.  Well written & fantastically told, this is the first Dennis Lehane novel I have read & I will definitely be reading more by him!
B00A2H9L2E|5.0|After reading a lot of negative reviews and seeing roughly two terrible previews I went into this fairly concerned that it would be awful. I did not watch this in 3D and unfortunately there were a few awkward scenes that were meant solely for 3D and when viewed in regular they seemed overly cheesy and weird.<br /><br />This one isn't that scary but it does have a lot of creepy parts. Several scenes felt very rushed and several of the monsters barely had a justifiable amount of screen time because of it. This movie should and could have easily been longer and I feel it would have been twice as great if the scenes had deeper development.<br /><br />All in all I really enjoyed this movie, it did the best it could in transferring a terrifying video game to a 90 minute film. The acting was great, the soundtrack was of course awesome and the special effects were the best they could be. A few scenes will defiantly stick around in my head as being not only creepy but refreshingly original.<br /><br />I won't say if it was better than the first or not because they are almost two completely separate things. Even though this is a direct sequel it has a totally different feel to it and it works. I watched the first and then this one back to back and it was a perfect combo.<br /><br />Not a terrifying horror but a very creepy, gory and entertaining movie. I am a huge fan of the video game franchise and I loved this movie.
0689815816|4.0|Repetition sees to be very cool for two year olds. They like knowing what to expect so that they can say the words along with the reader! I wish the author would have trimmed down a few of the repeated lines...it's too much for the kids to remember, but it is a fun book, and the kids love the ending!!!
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Loved every minute of this movie.  Didn't get bored once. Highly recommend.  Streaming it on my laptop was so much more convenient than viewing at the theater.
B007MU85D0|5.0|Love many of the songs, enjoy the others, overall great album! Love love love is one of my favorite. I purchased the album because of &#34;little talks,&#34; but through sampling the other songs it seemed like it was worth the album purchase, it definitely was.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so much fun. great way to pass the time away.  some games are really difficult. keeps you very interested in them.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|I saw the series on TV, reading the book made every thing very clear. Both the series and the book are superbly written and produced.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|It is a great book for a great Christmas day and it is a great Christmas book to read on Christmas eve and day and you should the movie it is a good thing to watch on Christmas day.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I saw the movie first because it sounded really cool and I did not know that it was based on a book.  After reading the book and watching the movie I have to say that the book is by far a much better read than the movie.  Mitchell paints a vivid image of a not-to-far off fantasy world and draws the reader in.  I found this book almost impossible to set down once I started it and after finishing it I found myself wishing it had been a even longer endeavor.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great sequel and more challenging than the first. The graphics are awesome and there are more things to unlock that will keep you hooked.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|have been playing for a while now and enjoy it very much. my 9 month old loves watching the little ponies run around and the music is very cute and up beat.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best...you are not going to be able to stop playing it! This game is on the top of my list.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I couldn't of asked for a better ending!!!! Every detail covered<br />and no questions unanswered. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to read this or any series!!!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Good book I really enjoyed it.  It had more adventure than I thought it would, will buy it for my sister.
1401324649|5.0|As an author of geezer-lit mysteries, I particularly enjoyed this whimsical romp through the aging process with a mix of crime and flashbacks to some of the most important events and interesting historical characters of the last eighty years. Like Water for Elephannts if moves from the current point of view of an aging man back to the adventures of his ealier years. Like Forrest Gump, the protagonist, Allan Karlsson, has interacted with some of the most famous people in recent history.A delight.

B00BLGXL3U|5.0|I understand this is a difficult movie and there are no admirable characters in it.  Normally that turns me off too.  But Joaquin Phoenix (and I don't like his public persona) gave the best acting performance of the year.  Philip Seymour Hoffman was not far behind.  PT Anderson s/b considered best director of the year. (Ang Lee? Really?)  Amy Adams also did another great job. (They were considering Reese W. for this part? Really?)  I thought the sound track was unusually good.  (Usually I don't notice the sound track unless it irritates me).  I think in a few years many will see this film and wonder why it was not received more favorably in awards and financial success than it has been.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I don't think its a good idea to have my devises which can be lost or stolen always logged in.  Otherwise this app seems to work well
B009FZHYKU|4.0|This is purely a fantasy of what it would be like if a plague (just guessing) had taken over the world and what happens after that.  Only the fittest will survive.  Makes you think.  I miss some of the characters that died but the series isn't over yet they may reappear.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|This stylus with three different size tips is the perfect partner for the Kindle Fire 7 in tablet. With it's multiple size tips it can be used on some of the most challenging games where a larger tip might interfere with the game play. Recommend highly.
B002XUL9B4|5.0|Nora is entertaining and the video is cute.  My grandson's especially liked it with me and its something we can watch over and over again and not get tired of it.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Would rate it 4.5 stars.  Great cast - John Goodman is over the top.  Showed the power of alcohol addiction.  Was not expecting that ending.

1591396190|4.0|I chose this book because marketing and starting a business  are subjects that I am interested in. This book is really  good, it gives you a lot of insight on what to do when you are head to head with competition  and stuck on your sales. a lot of the strategies that this book mentions make perfect sense. I give this book 4 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />hey mr vogel this is not my account instead i used my cousins because i had to purchase something in order to write a review!<br /><br />k .kool<br />Adam Ramirez eng 340 m/w 730
B00BESM14U|5.0|Thought provoking and moving.  I have been meaning to watch this movie since it first came out and I was not disappointed.  With an intricate plot-line that follows Charlie through his freshman year of high school, viewers can see the growth in the characters and are filled with hope.  Despite all the pain of life, three friends learn how to be confident, hopeful, and adventurous.
0061353248|5.0|I have not written any product reviews on Amazon, but I was forced into writing one because of my sincere admiration and new-found respect for Prof. Dan Ariely. I was introduced to the science of Behavioral Economics and the irrational decisions people make in their lives. The author, through his experiments, has an uncanny knack of explaining all the profound concepts in a simple and entertaining manner. The contents in this book will quite literally open your eyes and make you wonder how people are living in this so-called idealistic world of rational decision making. Some of the key ideas presented in this book are:<br /><br />-> How humans perceive value - \\"not in absolute terms, but one with respect to another,\\" and this is how companies and marketers deceive people with \\"seemingly attractive\\" offers that you cannot resist.<br />-> Market forces of supply and demand only apply to rational people - in the real world, companies exploit people's irrationality and influence prices and demand.<br />-> The power of FREE - People are, in essence, losing some other resource in trying to procure FREE items.<br />-> The wonderful distinction of market and social norms, and why and how they cannot coexist. He also explains how companies can motivate their employees using social benefits, which are cheaper and stronger than financial incentives.<br />-> As long as money is not involved, we are caring social animals.<br />-> Why people exhibit different behaviors when they are \\"normal\\" (cold state) and when they are \\"aroused\\" (hot state). Learning to bridge the gap between the two extreme states is very important and will help you avoid making errors or bad decisions that you will forever regret.<br />-> The high price of ownership reveals three irrational quirks in human behavior - we are deeply attached to what we have; we often focus on what we may lose (also called Loss Aversion); we assume other people (or buyers of our goods) to also value the goods in the same manneras we do.<br />-> People's expectations can cloud their thinking, and they use this as a marketing strategy to influence their friends' tastes and preferences.<br />-> Price is so powerful that it can drive the Placebo Effect - the more the price, the more the utility you derive from the product. This phenomenon was explained with Aspirin - why a 50 cent Aspirin can do what a penny Aspirin can't.<br />-> Trust is an important public resource and a necessary lubricant of the economy. A few bad players in the market can completely erode it.<br />-> Why even the most morally upright person can be susceptible to making small crimes that hardly matter. However, a contemplation of moral behavior or a religious code of law before doing any action can greatly reduce the likelihood of people committing these petty crimes.<br />-> The idea of FREE LUNCHES in behavior economics; the science of economics should be modified to account for how people actually behave instead of how they should behave in society.<br /><br />These are just some of the important principles explained in the book through experiments and startling revelations. It is easy to read and highly entertaining. However, there is one minor flaw in this book - the concepts and results described are all based on experiments performed on American college students or the western society, which may not be applicable to the more conservative societies in the world.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE - Predictably Irrational is a wonderful book with new insights into irrational behavior in people. But for the one criticism, I believe this can change the way people think about economics, and can result in newer norms that account for our actual and not ideal behavior.<br /><br />PS: For people interested in reading more about behavior and cognitive sciences, I have the following book suggestions:<br />1. \\"The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business\\" by Charles Duhigg.<br />2. \\"Thinking, Fast and Slow\\" by Daniel Kahnem.<br />3. \\"The Upside of Irrationality\\" by Dan Ariely.<br />4. \\"The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail -- but Some Don't\\" by Nate Silver
B0037VNX44|4.0|I really wish I could do a split review for this movie.  The story itself, about one of the most famous prisoners in the British penal system is really not very deep.  Bronson is a guy that is more comfortable in prison than out in the world, that much is made clear, but it never really goes beyond that as to why that is the case.  The movie is a little repetitive in that the basic story is that Bonson attacks guards and prison officials at almost every opportunity that he has.  They move him from prison to prison and put him in solitary, but it is the same cycle.  I realize that this is actually the truth and close to reality for 30 years in real life, but that repeated cycle does not make for an engaging story. 3 stars.<br /><br />With all that being said, Tom Hardy is masterful in his portrayal of a clearly disturbed individual.  Everything about him is almost unrecognizable.  His expressions, movement, and gait are all transformative.  What an outstanding performance, especially since there are many segments in which he is essentially doing a one man show in front of an imaginary audience.  The closest thing that I can think of in relation to inhabiting a character would be Daniel Day Lewis as Bill the Butcher in Gangs of New York (oddly enough, a character with a similar facial look).  Hardy's performance is even more impressive in that he carries the entire movie, every scene and all the narration. 5 stars.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Best Bond yet!!! I am going to have to watch it again just to make sure I didn't miss anything.....
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|I have had a friend tell me for months that I needed to see this movie.  I am really more of a boxing fan than a MMA fan so I avoided seeing it for a long while.  That was a real mistake.  You definitely do not have to be an MMA fan to really enjoy this film.  Both Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy do a great job portraying a set of brothers, each with their own important reasons for needing MMA.  The are part of a family that has had every connection ripped apart, even a shared hatred of their father is not enough to pull the brothers together.  The fist 3/4 of the movie is pretty evenly split between the brothers so that when the inevitable climax happens, you are not sure that there can be a winner or that you even have a rooting interest in the fight.  That is the real mastery of this movie, that there is not one brother that you view as the favorite.  By that point in the movie, you want to root for them both, and you want things to work out for both, but you are not sure that there is any way that this can happen.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Could not get my kindle to boot up...Thought something was wrong with the Kindle..Turns out, I  just needed a new charger...I really like this charger because it is longer then my other one and I can plug it in and still read as it is charging...

B007N85POS|3.0|While this is very engaging, it turns out that power-ups must be purchased as only a nominal number of them come with the game itself.  Also, I could find no information about game play or hints such as that some of the birds have enhanced capabilities when tapped in flight.
030758836X|2.0|I heard rave reviews about this book and even Amazon listed it on its Best Books of the Month.  Part I of the book was unnecessarily long and the author seems to have had realized this and thus rushed the last two entries of Part I which give away the character's intentions.  Then there is build-up and more build-up and omg moments and then Part III, the part we are waiting for....and.....nothing.  The author is tired of writing after 400 pages and runs out of imagination so she just ends the book....worst ending ever...it does not reflect the great build-up and it makes me wish I never read the book.  A good book is one you never want to end but I want all my time back.  I saw most of the &#34;surprise&#34; parts coming long before they happened but many were good, but the conclusion was disappointing not because of what happened or didn't happen but because it was poorly written and unimaginative and lazy.  Don't waste your time unless you have lots of time.  If you're just wondering about all the hype, just read the summary of the book which is $2.

B009E3EY38|5.0|All the technical issues and sound quality have already been addressed here, so my focus is only a few personal thoughts. Led Zeppelin has been my favorite band since I was about 15, all the way back in 1977. Sadly, the band never toured the US again after that year, and I never got to see them live. This CD and DVD set make up for that, at least in a small way. All these years later, they still rock like no other band. I was pleasantly surprised by how well Jason Bonham filled in for his father. Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones haven't lost a bit of their edge. And Robert Plant will always be the rock god.

We are artist, sales people, lovers, and losers. We do not all have grey hair and dress<br />in our pajamas. This was a real movie about real people. Done with humor and compassion.  I loved it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This has more to do with the horrors of seeing, hearing, and knowing people are dying around you, than it does being a love story. This book gets down to the absolute destruction something like that can do to a person. The nightmares she lived through and still barley found joy in raising children. Collins doesn't sugar coat anything. In fact she lays it out in a bloody mess of dead tributes and helpless hopes.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|I love SciFi. There just isn't enough good SciFi at any one time. I paid for this, it was not worth it.<br />No surprises. The acting is bad. I did not finish the movie. That rarely happens for me.

B007SGM084|5.0|I've never read a book quite so thrilling. There were twist and excitement. The sex blew my mind... The title screams sex and mystery, the sex wasn't so graphic as other novels which is great. The twist were amazing and I could never put the book down!
1932100660|4.0|food for thought, no pun intended.  Good information if you are concerned about your diet and how it affects your health.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|This book had a novel theme, where flowers each had a mood name.<br />I did like the story, and found reading it pleasant, but not exciting.<br />It was well written, and descriptive.
B00340LM8C|4.0|Classic Hitchcock movie.  Kept us guessing until the end. Does have some dubbed voice overs for French actors that isn't too distracting. We enjoyed it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Big letters, good price, what more can an old man want out of life! Thank you for the calculator Amazon.
B007IK44CK|4.0|Exciting fast paced movie.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Cruise doesn't show signs of slowing down yet.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|From the moment I picked up the book, I had to keep reading to see how it ended. It captures you on the first page and then won't let go.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|Watch this instead of 'It's a Wonderful Life,' 'A Christmas Story,' or 'Miracle on 34th Street.' Musical, action, fantasy, and comedy all packaged in one movie. Put a ribbon on it and your present is ready!
B00656C6KK|3.0|I was not that satisfied with the songs that are on this CD. I don't believe the songs that were portrayed were the best for Doris Day's voice. She was the outstanding singer of her time and I just feel the songs could have been better selected.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love  this game it is the funniest game ever it was the first game I got . I like it better on a kindel fire
B004GHNIRK|2.0|It probably would be  great book for someone following this story but I am not one of it's fans.  however I wouldn't say it was bad either.  Just not my kind of book.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I needed a simple calculator on the go and this works perfectly. I use it mostly to calculate sales tax.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really like this solitare game called Spider.  It is different than any of the others and you really have to concentrate to win.  Very addictive.
B007BVOEPI|1.0|They are trying to create this world where the value of human life is very low and they revel debasing it and ending it in depraved ways. I think the creators of this show being socially irresponsible. Just because you can doesn't mean you should.
B005LAIHVI|2.0|Jack the Giant Slayer, directed by Bryan Singer (X-Men, Valkyrie), is the tale of Jack (Nicholas Hoult), a struggling farm boy that happens to meet Isabelle (Eleanor Tomlinson), the adventurous princess of Cloister.  After a priest gives Jack a sack of mystical beans (which shouldn't be touched by water), Jack and Isabelle are suddenly separated during a rain storm when one of the beans grows into the heavens, or in this case, the home of the giants - taking Isabelle with it.  King Brahmwell (Ian McShane) sends a group of his men, including Jack, Elmont (Ewan McGregor) - the leader of the king's army, and Lord Roderick (Stanley Tucci) - the king's trusted/devious advisor, to retrieve his daughter.  Naturally, matters are complicated when the humans are captured by the giants.  Eddie Marsan and Ewen Bremner also star in supporting roles, while Bill Nighy and John Kassir lend their voices for Fallon, the double-headed leader of the giants.<br /><br />Sadly, this film had a great deal of potential, yet the script suffered mightily from lack of character development, as well as plot depth - which can both be detrimental to the quality of the overall film.  However, Nicholas Hoult (one of the young, up-and-coming actors) saves the day with his fearless prowess and giant slaying ability.  Even though Hoult does have some bland scenes, he isn't to blame for his poorly written character.  Obviously, a film like this is not going to be overly heavy on the dialogue anyway, but still - it would have been nice to see at least one show-stealing scene between ANY of this cast's fine actors.  But, sadly (once again), it never comes.  Ewan McGregor and Ian McShane, two masterful and powerful actors, both have their talents utterly wasted in this film.  Their characters are bland, mediocrely written, and just downright forgettable.<br /><br />Overall, the script stays true enough to the original stories, Jack and the Beanstalk and Jack the Giant Killer - enough so to make for an interesting viewing experience.  While the expectations for fairy tale live action films are low (even though the budgets are typically high), director Bryan Singer makes the best out of this film, and for that he should be commended.  Combine Singer's direction with the visibly pleasing CGI, not to mention a plot that gives the bare minimum amount of information, and we arrive at a perfectly average fairy tale/fantasy film.  It's certainly not as interesting as The Lord of the Rings, but it's also not as frighteningly horrible as 2011's Red Riding Hood.  Therefore, Jack and his beanstalk can take some solace right between the lands of 'greatness' and 'terrible.'<br /><br />Overall Film Grade:  C-<br />FNDNreview.comeresting viewing experience.

B00BHMF578|5.0|Now I know what the name stands for!  Well done movie. I have heard that a few things were added for cinematic effect bit overall, my wife and I were not disappointed.  Mr. Affleck has surely come into his own as an actor and director.  The streaming of this movie via my Roku was very good!

B00AFOS6QG|5.0|Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds' \\"Push the Sky Away\\" can be misleading upon first listen. It seems to float along rather than chug, which is a shift from their previous Grinderman-tinged effort, \\"Dig! Lazarus, Dig!\\" However, \\"Push the Sky Away\\" is suffused with just as much, if not more, brooding intensity and patient, literary might as any of their best albums. Aside from one amorous tune, \\"Wide Lovely Eyes\\" (albeit one of his loveliest), Cave's lyrics here alternate between dark satire (think: \\"Higgs Boson Blues\\") and regretful pining (as in the wondrous \\"Jubilee Street\\"). There is even space for meta-writing, as Cave describes the aftermath of \\"Finishing Jubilee Street.\\"<br /><br />Yet the album's genius lies in what I could only call \\"quiet dissonance.\\" Nick Cave fans are no strangers to the macabre and tilted sounds of guitar scrapes or haunting violin loops and layers, but this album employs these (and more) on a much subtler level, making each listen more chilling than the last. As the album's titular track lurks its way into one final, reluctant mantra ('You've gotta just keep on pushin' it / keep on pushin' it / push the sky away\\"), the album's crippling malaise truly sinks in. This is a meditation on modern-day despair.<br /><br />Don't go looking for \\"The Boatman's Call 2,\\" because this isn't it.

B00APJLX8E|3.0|It has more than a few slow parts. It has some funny moments but not enough to really keep me entertained to the max as some other animated features have.<br /><br />Just ok.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Great movie. It was a lot better than I thought it would be. I watched it with my daughter-we both enjoyed it.

B00338QENI|4.0|I knew nothing of HeLa cells or how medical research approached the procurement of cells for research before reading this book. The scientific aspect of the story fascinating, along with the additional material the author has included. The story of the lives affected here was winding, twisting, convoluted and somewhat confusing at times, but that's what real lives are like. I enjoyed this book.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|This is the easiest version of Sudoku puzzles I have every  played. I can get done with a puzzle in half the time since it is so easy to pencil in the numbers that could go in the box.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I got hooked on Downton recently and had to get a Roku just to watch....well, imagine my disappointment when Netflix didn't have season 2....or for that matter, much else.  Amazon is great!  I have this series nearly watched and a pile of other movies and shows ready in queue.  Cable TV in my opinion is not worth it but streaming and Amazon are ideal.
B00A2LOAKI|4.0|Great movie most of the material captured from the comic storyline. The actor portraying Batman voice did not meet his previous voice expectations

B007J4T2G8|5.0|First book I've read since graduating college, definitely more exciting than any textbook! The author kept it very interesting, sexy, wanting more... on to the next book.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|honestly when it comes to thermal paste almost everyone uses this stuff.  It is not recommended for people who are slightly clumsy though because it is conductive so make sure not to get it on anything but the processor.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The 3rd Season is great. The quality of the DVD is excellent as well as the price. I highly recommend this product.
0718177517|5.0|Kudos to the author. An excellent read should be ready by every American. I seriously do NOT believe there was ANY classified information in this book.  I am amazed at what these warriors must endure, including the waiting for Washington to decide.  Interesting how they must abide by Geneva rules but the other side can be ruthless and use those rules to their advantage.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is approite for all ages older than four ever one should explore this wonderful game. I. love it
B0063IH60K|5.0|Just what you'd expect from this traditional card game.  You can customize the cards and background so it's pretty.  The ads aren't bad because you can smoothly and easily dismiss them or take that time to chill between hands.
B00AHTYGRW|3.0|...but as an account of a real event it's pretty much pure grade American Bull****.<br /><br />Read up on the reality of how this happened and you will understand why the Canadians are getting so annoyed.<br /><br />CANADA saved those Americans (with minor help from Britain) and the CIA did very little in reality.  The guy that Affleck plays was there only a day and and half, the main character should have been the head of the Canadian Consul as he was the real hero of this affair.<br /><br />But this will become the accepted version of history and the Academy has gold-stamped the re-write.  It's sad, but we were silly to have expected anything better.
B009O07NMA|5.0|Love this CD and the guys on. We had to listen to all the songs and they are all very good. Can't wait to see them in concert!
1439181780|5.0|Fantastic book and excellent author!!! I have read all of Rhonda Byrne's books. I recommend all of &#34;The Secrect&#34; books. They are very helpful. Good for the soul. Very positive results.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I started watching season 3 and realized it was much too good to miss season 1 and 2. Received the package as promised and just love the series. Thank you Amazon for making them available.
B005LAII12|5.0|&#34;TED&#34; is an excellent movie. It's a little slow to start however, it turns out to be an extremally funny movie. I love it. I have watched it several times and of course i recommed it to all my friends and family. I have purchased several copy's for friends and family.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|This was a book I purchased for free off Book Bub.  It's only ok because I haven't read it yet, but I have so many it will be years before I could do this review if I wait.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|Full version offers much more but really slowed my kindle down and sometimes freezes when using FF version. Hate the constant ads.<br /><br />:)
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|At first the book seemed like a fun, quirky British novel, but then it went much deeper. It is a story of love, healing, and redemption. And fun, quirky British humor. Highly recommended.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Loved the free version enough we got the paid one. My 8 year old can figure out most of the levels to at least free Perry, but the added challenge of also getting the gnomes in each level made it hard enough for me, too. My six year old daughter also plays, but sometimes needs help with some of the harder levels.
B002P4VUMQ|5.0|This was a Christmas Gift for a family member, and they are enjoying it very much.<br />Someone else had mentioned this item to me and I was glad I purchased it.
B005NKGEP2|2.0|Confusing,  ending???  had trouble following the cities that they lived in. Makes one think if their money is safe when using the internet to bank. Read for one of my book clubs.
B008XCM18Q|5.0|This book explores the shadowy world of covert ops with the feeling of underlying true picture of things we know happen but don't want to know about. Riveting. Could not stop reading until the end.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Was not expecting what happened. The ending left me hungry for more. So worth reading and can't wait for the next one.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Words fail me. I cannot describe how glad I am to have read these books, and they will stay with me forever. I somehow fell obligated to leave a memorial for the characters... You all will live in my mind forever, and I will not, cannot, forget.
B003TGMFG4|5.0|Into The Wild is one of the greatest books I have ever read. I hate people who say things like that, but this is case it is absolutely true. John Krakauer does an unbelievable job researching Christopher Mccandless' story and writes in great detail not only of the story itself (Christopher Mccandless' journey) but also other similar stories as well as the circumstances of Christopher Mccandless' journey. Its a very well researched book.<br /><br />The book is about Christopher Mccandless, a young man who wants to escape civilization and live in the wild, off the land. His ultimate destination is Alaska, but on the way he travels through the western United States and comes in contact with several people. Christopher Mccandless leaves an impression with many of the people who he comes into contact with, which tells us a lot about this young man, his personality and his energy. It seems as though Christopher Mccandless was a very different and unique person. Not a lot of people are cut from the breed as Christopher Mccandless. His rejection of modern society is something that I think a lot of people will relate to. This book will speak directly to people who love life's simple elements and are not concerned with consumption and the things in life that are, at the end of the day, meaningless and fake.<br /><br />The book is very inspiring. A young man who wants something and he goes and actually does it. What Christopher Mccandless did was not easy. In fact, it was very very difficult. Not many people in the world would do what Christopher Mccandless did, no matter how badly they want to. Christopher Mccandless worldview is something that really spoke to me and it grabbed me. It grabbed me and it held me firmly in its grasp. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and have read it more than once. I highly recommend the movie as well. The movie is an amazing work of art as is also very touching and inspiring.<br /><br />All in all, Into The Wild is a phenomenal book and amust read. The story is amazing and Krakauer does a truly amazing job telling it. The book also goes into a lot of other stories which draw parallels to Christopher Mccandless' story. I highly recommend this book. It is not a big book and you will not want to put it down once you start reading. Read this book!
B00005JMXX|5.0|Replaced the stolen dvd and it's still as great as the first one I had. I would definitely watch it over and over.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly is always a good read whether it's Bosch or his half brother at the center of the action.
B008NABUU8|4.0|This is a fun and mildly challenging game. It isn't freezing on my phone. It has a pinch zoom feature so the small screen can be overcome. Definitely a fun way to kill time while waiting to get into an appointment or whatever, don't over analyze just a game.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|You gotta love a guy who beats the system that crapped all over him.  Grisham is a great storyteller because he doesn't leave loose ends.
B008YKGQR4|3.0|I love how easy it is to move from mobile to full!! I'm able to actually update and share thing on my fb. However, in mobile I'm not able to tag pages or people like I'm suppose to.I'm also not able to share thing on my page, or a friends page, message like we are suppose to either. We have to go to the full version to do these things, which can be a pain in the butt.  The mobile app was made to make it easier that always going to the full site!!! This is the same problem that the regular Facebook app has!!
B0061PEAUY|3.0|Not one of her best books.  Maybe the Kathy/Ryan thing is just getting old and everybody needs to move on.  The forensics are believable enough, it's the other actions by key characters that are hard to buy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this game so much. :)) and. The choices u make is amazing with with you're own charter.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|This is the second copy of this BBC production that I have and it is certainly worth the purchase.  The first copy I purchased several years ago (DVD) and the acting just blew me away.  This is by far the best rendition of Jane Austin's book.  My first purchase was a DVD.  This Blu-Ray version is outstanding in terms of the digital quality of the picture and sound.  That alone makes it worth having the Blu-Ray edition if you already have the DVD version.  For example, when compared with the DVD version of this film, I noticed the brilliancy of the colors of the actor's costumes more vividly.  The extras that are included on this film that describes its casting, production, etc... is also included on this Blu-Ray edition.  For any kind of Jane Austin fan at any kind of level, the Blu-Ray purchase is certainly a must!
B00992CF6W|1.0|It will it download.birth to download it and it's say that it failed and I don't know that to do I paid a lot for this app I should not have to go throw is
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Good story line on the part of Jane Austin and great acting on the part of Amanda Root and Ciarin Hinds.  I give it the good story line rating because the first Jane Austin film that I have witnessed was Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.  I guess it is a bit unfair to compare the two but it is Jane Austin and it is certainly a good story and worth the purchase.  I am somewhat surprised that they have not come out with a DVD version.  I will certainly purchase it if they do.
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|very interesting, fun and entertaining. I told all my friends at school about Matilda book. The story will keep engrossed till the end.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I love these kind of games. Fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun
B00A2H9LK6|5.0|in my opinion the first one was better but the 2nd one was great none the less. it didnt lose its scary factor and there is quite a bit of jumpy parts which is fine with me. its definitely gruesome but its not over the top gruesome.its a must see for all of you silent hill fans out there.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|If you travel outside your own country you always see people just like this. Some forget that THEY are the foreigners. Some love the adventure and some wish they had never left home. Dame Judi Dench and Dame Maggie Smith steal the film as always. I recommend this to anyone that loves to travel. The film is full of color, humor and real life. I think seniors will get a special kick out of this one.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Best series I ever read front to back. I recommend this series to anyone. A trilogy of love, deception, hatred, courage, honor, and glory.
B001AYENBM|4.0|Very well done Zombie movie, when the alternate ending is used.  The regular ending is the typical ho-hum blast 'em up.  The alternate ending is much better - get this version if you like Sci Fi!<br /><br />However, I wish it had done more explaining what made the zombies different, and how they could be cured. If that had been in the movie, would have made it a better biologic sci-fi thriller, instead of a slightly biologic Zombie flick.  So just 4 stars because I'm an obsessive medical type guy.
B003BW0CB6|4.0|Excellent Connelly novel again! I liked seeing a different side to Haller and hope we get to explore Maggie a lot more. Bosch is a great character and the reason I read this series. Looking forward to the next chapter! Great writing.
B002XOTPU2|4.0|I love the Simon's Cat videos on youtube. This book was cute, but not as endearing without all the sound effects.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Great continuation of an intriguing story. It sucked me into an exciting world each night. Can't wait to start the next one!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|this book was intriguing from the first chapter and held my attention from beginning to end.  It was rich in characters and the storyline was fascinating.  I would highly recommend this book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome. Loved every minute of it.  I wanted to keep reading every time I started. And wanted to go back to the book every time I put it down.  Can't wait to read the next one
B007KOYEOC|4.0|It is great to learn what impact Partners can have on each other . Next page of the book is never as expected
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was absolutely intriguing from front to back. Was impossible to put down. It's hard not to relate to the main characters.
B0045HCJFS|4.0|Ok i like the film , but i bought the dvd and it was censorded , and then i come on here and it says uncut , thats pathetic  no uncut in the uk just america .
B00AREIAI8|4.0|compete, groom, feed your horse! lots of fun, my only complaint is due to the reading involved it is difficult for a 5 yr old to play without help.
067144901X|5.0|This is a cute and simple book. I would think that any kindergartner or first grader would be able to read it. It has cute pictures and is a great board book.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|The moment I picked this book up, I knew I wouldn't be able to put it own. Mira, had me guessing at every turn. Waking Up Married, is intense and alluring. A magnificently written romance novel.
0399226907|5.0|This is a nice book for toddlers, my son is two and loves looking at books. I like that this book is a board book, so he can easily hold it and it won't be easy to tear.
B00B2QA646|5.0|I have seen most versions and was a little skeptical at first about this one, but it absolutely won me over.<br />The cinematography is spectacular and the staging in the early set up stages is sometimes fantastical and sometimes elegiac.<br />All the performances are excellent. I would say that it helps to know the story in advance so you can focus on the lavish production. I am tempted to call it a masterpiece.
B004LROUNG|5.0|John Grisham never disappoints.  His characters are sometimes flawed and often the under dog but are good at what they do. They usually come through in the end and are the heroes.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is pretty cool one thing is that they should definitely make the world bigger and do a lot more things than what it does but other than that it is one of my favorite games on the kindle fire
B008XTVWHK|5.0|The movie was delivered on the first day that they listed as an approx. delivery date. The picture is nice an clear. I loved this movie as a young girl. The perfect combination of love, adventure, archeology, and sci fi. The same pson who did the special effects for this movie did it also for clash of the titans...another favorite. Appropriate for everyone,
B009GXHOW4|1.0|Doesn't even work on my kindle it just saves and doesn't show up this needs to be a lot better
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Once I started reading, I couldn't put this book down.  It's paced so well, it kept me fully engaged to the last page and gave me quite a few plot turns that I did not anticipate.  So, don't start it unless you have a good block of time to devote to it.  Having been a teenager in the 80's, I was hooked the first reference to Oingo Boingo (my fav of all time).  All the references to my youth made me smile and although I will admit I didn't get them all, I certainly got the majority of them.  The characters are fleshed out very well and endearing.  I cared what happened to them, worried about them and cheered for them too.  Great read.  I'm looking forward to Ernest Cline's future books!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|It is awesome I mean it doesn't really sound like spiderman but the game is great and the story stays interesting one problem is sometimes it randomly resets all of my data but my level and coins stay if you could fix that it would be 10 stars no doubt but anyone out there who is a fan of spiderman should buy this it is awesome
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Suffer is a great game that all ages would be able to play. This game is so adicting! I play it all day long and its a game that you never get tired of,and the best part is every month there is a new update I just updated mine to the newest one World Tour Rio. Its really good and throughout the game there are these colorful eggs and you have to collect 100 of them! The game is really great and I would strongly suggest downloading it from the cloud.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I love the presistance of the game and how it keeps me feeling like I have to come back for more. its a great game hands down
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Someone's trying to make us think the CIA has some usefullness.  Technical flaws ruin a movie for me.  A 747 Aircraft has a takeoff speed of about 180 mph, and here we see 1970's vintage cars traveling along beside one as it takes off.  This reminds me of the movie, The Great Escape, where, in WW2,  Americans led an escape from a German POW camp, and later, I learned there were no Americans involved in the actual event.  My apologies to all Canadians.
B000I9UA8U|5.0|Watched it with someone who doesn't normally like &#34;artsier&#34; or &#34;european&#34; films all that much and they loved it too. Hilarious + very human + great acting = awesome.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|fun cool awesome great funny coolest I think that this is great game for wild spirt best game in the world.
B009VMN3RA|5.0|Was difficult for me to put this book down. Thanks Sachi for being courageous enough to share your story with me!  It was not what I expected......but so much more, as your soul comes through this entire book.  You are a very talented lady.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it is the best game ever I love horses. I have too horses in this game there names are Leo a paint horse and Hanna a corter horse I love this game
B00B22IJXK|3.0|I agree w/another reviewer that the demo photos are very misleading-- getting those results w/this app would be very difficult -- which was why I bought the app. Oh well. For photo work PicShopPro/PicSayPro/ &amp; especially PicsArt are far superior. This one is fine good enough for your 1st photo app but why stop at the first step? The drawing/painting  works fine as well but there  are better ones also.Not bad/not great.
B008KZVNFS|5.0|This miniseries is excellent and definitely worth watching. For some reason, the critics feel compelled to compare it automatically with Downton Abbey. The two series are completely different. Just because they are both British period dramas produced by the BBC does not mean they should be exactly alike. Sure they take place around the same time, but the protagonists are completely different. The only parallel I would make is Matthew Crawley's character in Downton Abbey is somewhat similar to Christopher Tietjens's character in Parade's End (i.e., both are extremely honorable men...almost to a fault). If you are a fan of Downton Abbey, you will more than likely enjoy this miniseries!!!
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|is an okay game.not one that held my attention.  although many of my friends really do like it.  proof that not every game is for everyone!  but thats ok too!
B004IM14RY|5.0|This movie was abosolutely great. So different from any other movie I've seen yet still intriguing the whole way through. It was full of every emotion and feeling from fear and anger to hopelessness to hope. The little things make a movie, such as good actors, symbolism, and the little string of hope the writer gives which plays an important part (with Dan Brenner and the story of the kid). SO GOOD and recommended highly. One of Ryan Reynolds' best!
B004I744AS|5.0|easy to use. great features.  there are interesting historical articles daily. some entertaining and challenging games also,<br />is an app that gets a thumbs up!
B00003CXCQ|5.0|this is a great price, for a great movie.  it has tons of extras and looks great on screen too
B009GXHOW4|1.0|when I installed this app I thought it would help me. It actually glitches out my kindle and forced me to restart. I advise you to NEVER get this app.
0452257743|5.0|I bought this book because &#34;Rage&#34; is in it. I wanted to read it but wasn't going to pay the premium. Any copy of the book I could find was going for $300+ due to them being pulled off the shelves. The book itself is in good condition. I have yet to read the book. The 5 star rating is due to the book's condition coupled with the fact that it has another book in it ('The Long Walk') that I want to read.
B007L5GDGW|1.0|This game is so glitchy, it takes about 10 seconds for the game to restart. This tilt motion gama is horrible. Please do not waste your valuable money on this junky game.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a great book. The only reason I would put it down at night was so that I could get some sleep for work the next day. Great thriller that keeps you guessing for the most part. Although it was predictable a few times.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|All must read this book. Even my ten year older learned lessions. It gives an eye opening perspective to military life and values
B004GYY714|3.0|This AP is a little difficult to get used to. Some of the channels offered seem to have a weekly time usage limit. Found many nice free radio stations. Saved many for regular use. Like it better than IHart.
0812993357|2.0|This book had wonderful pictures - but the story of her life was too long about her.  It failed to me, to really give  more background about the era.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Most assuredly need one of these or something like it to protect the purchase, I would buy it again. If I upgrade to a new generation of Kindle Fire I will protect it with one of these systems.
B007M45PMU|4.0|Original, and not the same old thing that most bands are putting out. They give you something different in every song. I can play the album over and over and never get tired of listening to it.
B008NEVP1S|5.0|I heard Aimee on the Colbert Show and was very impressed with her lyrics and guitar playing. This was my first album by Aimee and I would highly recommend it. Will keep her in my music collection for years to come. Thank you Aimee for your talent.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Was great to sit home and watch this wonderful, informative, movie.  Especially after all the &#34;oscar director snub&#34;.  Ben Affleckdid a great job!!!!
B00AGKH6D8|5.0|I ordered this CD/DVD thinking it was just another Joe blues/rock CD. Well my husband and I were pleasantly surprised it is amazing. Such great work from each musician playing groove together. Very impressed with Joe Bonamassa's growth in the music world and his abilities to play just about anything. GO JOE!! We love u. You are a very humble person and deserve more respect in the blues world. Spaztastic is my husbands favorite. I love We want to Groove. Tai Bergman did such a fantastic job producing this wonderful amazing music. Hopefully we will hear more from Joe, Tai, Mike, Renato & Ron. I recommend purchasing this CD and &#34;Groooving Out&#34;
B00A757EFW|2.0|I do not care if this is a classic, the game sux, not much else to say. The game is flat out boring
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow allows me to think and use my brain to solve puzzles.  Flow is one of my favorite apps that I have on my kindle fire! Love this game!
B005GFPZYK|3.0|First let me just say up front that as a Vietnam vet, and as an American citizen I know full well how much is owed to Chris Kyle. Kyle saved countless lives and has my utmost respect, and his murder was a stupid, senseless act. That being said, I must admit his autobiography was a bit of a disappointment. Maybe it was just that my expectations were so high, but I never felt any real emotional connection with the author. The book was not terribly well written and never presented Kyle in a particularly favorable light. Granted he told his own story, and I'm sure he didn't care whether he was liked or not. Perhaps that was at least part of the problem. I wanted to like this man. I wanted to hear what he felt, but as he himself said more that once, he didn't seem to be able to express emotion or feeling. Maybe it was the nature of the training and the work, but the person who seemed to express themselves best in this book was the wife of Chris Kyle. She lived this story every single day. She is as much a hero as her husband, and he certainly was one.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Just like the rest of the series, it did not disappoint. Each book kept me interested and I found myself picking it up every spare moment I had. It was a nice surprise as I figured I probably wouldn't like the series, worried it would be to YA for me. Not an issue, it kept me interested the entire time and I enjoyed reading them.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|Fun game to pass the time on Kindle.  I like the water table in particular.  Since this game is free, it is well worth the download.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was surprised how much this book kept me interested. I was simply just curious when I purchased this series but I ended up being surprised on how well I liked them. They kept me interested and it didn't take me long to read the whole series. It's a great read, just to sit down and relax.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Very good book and interesting to read. A must read and worth spending money on. So it's a must buy.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Although I have never been disappointed with the Ice Age series this story brings to it even more emotion and entertainment!<br />Every actor (voice) is perfect! My favorite of course is Sid. These episodes provide the whole family with exciting and humorous entertainment.<br />This story based on Glacial movement and as the title suggests Continental drift. Introducing piracy, slavery, and bravery. The introduction of new characters help to keep these stories fresh and perhaps set the stage for even more adventures!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Works as advertised. Can't think of additional words to describe, except I use this to charge other items that use USB charges.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|What needs to be said about Harry Potter? Personally this is my favorite of all the episodes! The introduction of Harry and the rest of the cast produces the most wonderful and fantastic view of Harry's life before the deepest and darkest adventures enter in.
B0087ZFH8A|4.0|It's inspired. It created new trend. It have stood the test of time. Furter listening for me: The Exploited. dat
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|This full length version of Tim Burton's 1980s story has all of the characters and visuals expected from the &#34;interesting&#34; mind of Mr. Burton. Although not meant for the very young, this film lovingly tells it's bizarrely sweet &#34;Burtonesque&#34; story to the vast audience whom have grown up with and loved this genre ever since &#34;Nightmare Before Christmas&#34;.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved this book!  Much different than what I usually read!  But it was great, and kept me interested the whole time!!
B003V5K0AQ|4.0|Young actors including Shelley Duvall and Daniel Stern do this production a great service. The black and white artistry help set the time and mood for this short but  weirdly sweet story.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I only watch this series so that i can see sexy Norman Reedus, that is one hot hillbilly. The plot is pretty good too
B00APJLFEG|5.0|I have to say this story was not exactly what my 8 yo daughter and I expected. We both have now seen it 4 times in one month!  The story line, the humor, the characters all easily keep a smile on the faces of all who enter!  Every voice(actor) is well assigned and this movie proves to be a delight for the whole family! Keep them coming Adam S. and Andy S. ! Please?
B007L5GDGW|1.0|No really, the game is pointless. Don't bother downloading unless you enjoy uninstalling games within five minutes of installing. Even as FAOTD it's not worth the time
1452101248|5.0|I first purchased this book as a housewarming gift for a friend.  I loved it so much, I bought one for myself.  After that, I bought six more to give as gifts.  Beautiful pictures, new and exciting recipes, highly recommend it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very good. It is almost completely realistic. I would hi Ghostbusters my recommend it. I love this game
B006LSZECO|3.0|I didn't t think the book was bad, it was just a little odd. I like mysteries, so naturally I enjoyed it.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|This thing is accurate as all get out!  I just bust out the appropriate club and strike the greens on my approach shots because I have confidence in the yardage!  My Sky Caddie can be off by about 3 to 5 yards so the laser is handy as heck! Best buy yet!!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I love history and geography told with a great story.  Thought this was a wonderfully blended fiction and definitely a must read.
B001U1V3RW|4.0|I collect playing cards. And, for me, this deck is a great looking deck and is an excellent addition to my collection.
B000M343BM|4.0|Classic baseball movie.  Great ensemble cast with great story line.  Charley Sheen is great. Movie captures the insanity and the greatness of baseball at the same time.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a fascinating game but I wish I could play it longer without having to pay for the opportunity. to do so.
B0009S4IKQ|2.0|Interesting with being first big star ensemble, but other than that this is a major waste of time. More of a curiosity piece than anything else.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|As a amateur historian, I must saw how educational and enjoyable this short series was to view, it presented the human side of Adams (& family) in the proper context.  Definitely a good decision to purchase.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Jack Reacher.  What else needs to be said.  Lee Child continues the saga of Reacher and doesn't disappoint.  Must read for Reacher fans
B001PPLIEG|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this movie as a continuation of the James Bond series.  Plot was interesting and plausible, stunts were not so much fantasy or totally computer generated.
B005R32L66|4.0|this keeps me in touch with my grand kids and for that i love it. that being said, i do have a lot of problems connecing the call sometimes. but they do seem to work themselves out with alittle patience.
B000UX6THK|5.0|Hands down, the most definitive Twin Peaks collection ever produced.  It has it all and is a must have for any true fan.
B008CB9JJ2|5.0|It's so real, intimate and unpretentious. It could be anyone.It could be me. Auster at his best: an exercise in humility, sensitivity and down to earth humanity.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|We have had a few (pet) deaths in the family and believe it or not this movie helped explain what was going on.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|This is a fantastic film - it all senses of the word: great, amazing, incredible, and completely unbelievable, even though it is true. The less you know going into this movie the better. Very briefly it is the story of a 1970's American song writer and singer who's album \\"Cold Fact\\" became wildly popular as the voice and heart of white South Africans against apartheid and government oppression. Little was known about \\"Rodriguez\\" other than rumor, until in one release of the album a challenge was made to 'Search for Sugar man.' If you like documentaries you'll love this film; if you don't you might love it anyways.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|Requires you register. You have to allow access to personal info for some reason. Cannot use the app without WiFi connection. Deleted this.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Quite slow and occasionally melodramatic. Not enuf action as I thought it would be. Last 15 minutes great cliffhanger. Not years best film.
B002ZG980U|5.0|WOW!!! what an interesting concept and the theme was exciting. INCEPTION was a little hard to follow at first, but when I saw this movie the second time, the whole story was getting a little clear to understand. I sometimes do ask myself what if a dream can be so real that you don't know what is reality?? Everybody did a terrific job working as a team to hack into somebody's mind to accomplish their goal. Going into a dream over a dream looks really complicated if, by chance someone does control your every thought. Who knows, a dream come true.
B002SRQ214|5.0|Has worked well so far, after about a month of installing. It was fairly difficult to actually snap the processor into the motherboard for me because the thing they make you use seemed to be a little too short, however with quite a bit of pressure it eventually snapped in place and works just fine.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|This book is really the first part of ADWD, and it's the slower first half as it were.  Necessary but the slowest moving of the series as of ADWD.  Still a fun read.
B007ZXK08C|1.0|I was looking forward to reading this book; but I couldn't wait to finish it by the time I was only half-way through.  It started out okay with the author's development of the character, Amy, a spoilt, rich girl who felt she needed to put up a facade in order to be accepted by the smart set and then had difficulty keeping  up this fake persona  once she had married the man she wanted.  We then saw  her husband's discovery of this deception and his subsequent decline.  After that it all got quite ridiculous and totally unbelievable - I wasn't able to relate to any of the characters  -  the married couple were both horrible, scheming people who deserved each other.  The ending was very lame!  It was as though the author couldn't work out how to finish the story so she let them both \\"live happily ever after\\" which was really weird, seeing as the whole book was about their intense hatred for each other!  Didn't add up.  Can't recommend this one at all!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This so far is the fastest moving, most action/story packed book of the series so far.  Hope the HBO show can do it justice this season.
0307346617|5.0|Could not put this book down! Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Incredible writing! Read it twice. Recommend it to all of my Zombie/doomsday/apocalypse friends.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Why did I not catch this the first time?<br />It's a great blend of sci-fi and mystery.<br />Love the story line and the characters.<br />Awesome deal that it's free with Amazon Prime<br />Could not find this on Netflix and only the last season was on Hulu Plus
B0086700CM|3.0|Keeps the children and me entertained on long car rides and during long waits in a doctors office. Lots of fun.
B00AGKHFCA|5.0|All of the music was great and I enjoy listening to the CD while driving.  I especially liked the duet with Jennifer Lopez.
1400049628|3.0|Fun to read. Not sure I go along with everything Max says. A lot of the information is academic. Not sure how practical.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|subway suffers is so much fun I like it a lot more then temple run. but at first I had some issues with it 1 because it erased all of the saved stuff but I re earned it all back.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|This movie stunk. The description describes a mystery surrounding a plane crash. This was nothing more than a movie about a drunk/junkie and his own personal struggle. I've never been more disappointed in a film.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book took my standard of a good book, and just took it over the edge. This is now my favorite book
B0063GORYU|5.0|You can make it easy or challenging with the number of suits. It's get very hard with four but I like it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is awesome! I love this game and I've seen a 3 year old playing it on 2 different devices at the same time, which was pretty interesting.
B003QSMCKO|5.0|We love this movie, and it was so easy to access since we don't own it!  Would Definitely rent on amazon again.
034553154X|5.0|Took a couple weeks to get but is well worth the wait. awesome pictures or drawings. Bring on season 3 and the Wind o Winter!!!
B00003W8NM|4.0|great movie, it was in good condtion, no complaints here, thank thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks
B001UGB1X8|3.0|Lots of action.  Hard to understand the Civil War general's appearance. Stereotyped characters throughout.<br />Story line could have been more coherent. I still liked it.
B0018LMZOE|1.0|Reading all the reviews in 2012 of people receiving bad CD copies, I am wondering if anyone has received a bad copy since that time? It's March 2013. Thanks!
0500515328|5.0|the jewels of the Romanovs are beyond anything one could imagine. the wonder is that they have survived to this day
B006NBDBLK|5.0|Album looks great. Sleever and Record itself have a few scratches, but nothing serious to effect playing ability. Will be happy to display this once it is signed by band in March
B008XG1X18|5.0|Everything I'm interested in, and it's fun. No pressure. Easy to keep track of things, just like a virtual bulletin board.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|This case is magnificent.  The whole point of me buying it was because I liked that it looked like an actual book.  I love books, so I was very resistant to joining to 21st century and purchasing a kindle in the first place, but having a case that looks like a book helped ease the transition.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very addictive, no major problems, occasionally freezes but not often enough to be a problem. I could spend hours sat playing this game!!!
B009NQKXYK|3.0|Overall it was an interesting seague into the Alien mythos but it would've been better if we were given more backround about the Engineers.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|You must be patient to read the classics. They're not all Hollywood stunts and larger-than-life cartoon characters. However, I've taught Treasure Island for 20 years in my English classes, and I found it interesting to read over and over again, with my students, each year. If you're looking for a story of adventure on the high seas, this is the quintessential pirate novel.<br /><br />In fact, the Hollywood pirate owes his/her very existence to Robert Louis Stevenson, Jack Sparrow notwithstanding. Before Treasure Island, there was no connection with the one-legged pirate who bears his chatty parrot on his shoulder. That was all stuff of Stevenson's invention.<br /><br />To read this book is to comprehend the origins of the human fascination with piracy, maritime adventure, and the treasure hunt. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has the patience to read classics for the sake of personal enrichment.
B004RGHWIQ|1.0|it sucks 3d does not register on my emitter on my 3d tv i work 60 hrs a week  it took me 1 month and 2 weeks for me to get to watch it. and now i cant even return it  with out penalties of paying for shipping as well as  not getting a full refund ill be throwing this in the trash . the dvd looks just as clear as blue ray. what a joke don't buy this if u have a  3d tv with an external omitter with glasses  good movie but 3d wont flipping work.stuff like this makes me see red what a joke . amazon has always been there to replace stuff . not this time . my confidence in them  has been shook.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|other reviews are right when they say this is by far the best version ever.  The DVD wasn't any better than the VHS but this version is like watching a completely new movie!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Excellent film. I would recommend this movie to anyone seeking to either rent or own a movie for 2013. H
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you like temple run you will love subway suffers. but instead of monkeys with skeleton faces its a plioce officer chasing you because you were spray painting a tipped over truck. SO SO SO SO FUN. GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!
0783233477|5.0|This is a great movie, I can say that is the only movie which I like to watch every time wend i just want to relax and enjoy a great movie.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love the game. Great way to pass the time. Works great so far and doesn't appear to have any bugs needing yo be worked out.
B001FBIQD6|5.0|I bought this book for the story of collision causes,  I was on the Andrea Doria when it collied with the Stockholm,<br />I was one of the survivors.
B001TM14VC|4.0|Ive loved this movie for as long as I can remember! It never gets old, no matter how many times I've seen it. Remains in my list of 'go-to' movies.
B00021HBGS|4.0|These are a lot of fun in the bathtub. My daughter is going thru a phase of hating the bath and these helped us get her in the tub and to hang out and play. They stick well to the tub and easy to clean up.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|It was alittle slow to start and then the last went really fast. Clancy has a way to draw you in and keep you there. On the whole it was a good read.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Fb sold out and had way too many useless advertisements. I used to like it but now that they are rich it sucks.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I like how it says x battery life for surfing,music or movies not just x full and the pro version does offer more options than the free version ,worth it.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|Implausible and pathetic.  Forget about the plane crash or surviving in the wilderness, this movie is about a bunch of misfits being killed off one by one by a pack of wolves.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is strangely addictive... It's not often I find a game that I don't have to force myself to play a few times before I decide if I like it. no complaints.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|I bought this on pre order and it came on time and the day it was released. It is a great movie for any monster high fan.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing. That is all I have to say. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing.
B004XQYBA2|4.0|This game is awesome!  So much better playing on the phone rather than on newspaper type paper.  It's nice that if I get stuck, there is a hint feature.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|If you like puzzle games, this is the game for you. It gets progressively harder which increases the level of challenge perfectly.
B00AEFY552|5.0|A few historical inaccuracies, but the story line is engaging once you forgive the writers of thier sins. I can only hope that other film makers take as much care with their products as these did.
B0022W6L6G|5.0|Gold Dust Woman is the only song missing that I would purchase with this mp3 album. Just download this album them purchase Gold Dust Woman.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Great movie for for the whole famlie the kids and i loved the whole storie it was great lesson for the kid's on how famlies get along loved it
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I loved the movie but this is beautifully packaged and has a whole CD on how the movie was actually made.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|It's a great way to pass the time when you are at the doctor's office wating for your appintment that was so twenty minutes ago help's keep your blood pressure down lol
B002HJ9PTO|2.0|After almost using this for a year, I have to say this Audio Techinca  ATR-3350 Microphone is just a waste of time and money.<br />Here is what I don't like about it:<br />1. The battery on doesn't last long.<br />2. No light to show if microphone is on or off<br />3. Because of both of these faults, I have wasted countless hours of recording videos without a microphone (or battery)<br /><br />For the price, you get what you pay for.  The sound quality is good and long line and compact size make it desirable.<br /><br />Truth is, I would have rather paid a little more and got one where the battery lasted longer and had a light.<br /><br />I think there are better out there.  Save your money and more importantly your time.<br /><br />Very disappointed after I just uploaded 31 minutes of video without any audio.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Thisis the best of the best because the blue dont fool itl fighr to tje fight because it subway sufr
B00008GKEG|5.0|I have been a Beatles fan for many years.  This anthology had lots of information that I had never heard before.  I loved hearing some of their earlier tunes again.  It is very well done.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|This game is really fun and addicting!  There are no problems with this game at all.  Plus if you run out of coins they have a free coins thing were you can earn&hellip;FREE COINS!!!! It's really fun and I would recommend it to all ages because it's simple to play:)
B007EECSFA|4.0|I love books that involve family secrets.  This book had a big secret to reveal.  It kept going back and forth between the past and the present but I did,not get confused at all.<br />I love every book I have read by Kate Morton .
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|I really lllllloooooovvvvvvveeeeeee this game but its too short and I really want it to be longer SOOOOOO they should make demos longer
0525425578|4.0|I am looking for a series or genre that my 11 year old grandson can enjoy and be inspired to read.  This is a well written book with better depth of character than most juvenile or YA titles.  This book is actually better than some of the adult Gresham titles.  The plot is not so formalistic, and the the lawyer characters seem to enjoy their work.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game if u like temple run than u will like this. This is definitely a favorite of mine
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I now have series 1, 2,  and 3 and my family watch them every Friday and we watch them repeadly.  This is an excellent series for the entire family!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very fun game to play and it is very addicting this game has glities every every now and then but they are not to bad!:)
0316232955|5.0|Already a huge Chris 'appreciator' (I won't use the word 'fan'), I looked forward to reading this book expecting good things anyway.  However, what I wasn't prepared for, was a book, written by a young man at the very start of his career that is so 'well-rounded' and accomplished that it made me (a not so young person, much further on in my life and career) stop and think.  Yes it was funny - hilarious in parts but it was so much more than a cheap coming of age look at life in an American high school. It was a book full of wasted opportunities and dreams but not through the fault of Carson Phillips, the main character.  Carson couldn't have dreamed much harder.  The waste came in Carson having all those dreams snatched away from him, robbing him of a future which could have held so much for him. The realisation all the way through the book that Carson's dreams were destined to be just that  was the hardest pill to swallow of all (even though being struck by lightning happens at the end and not the beginning of the book like the film does).  I think knowing the ending made the book even sadder.  I have read critiques that criticise Carson's character saying that it is hard to feel sorry for such an obnoxious teenager.  I just do not share their view on this at all.  Carson has had to develop a thick outer shell to cope with being a 'square peg in a round hole' all his life.  It would be enough to leave even the most optimistic person jaded.  And jaded he is until his plan gets underway and Carson realises that most people have their own cross to bear.  And the fact that Carson realised this just before his death increases the impact of his departure from this tough and crazy world in which we all live.  Chris - you amaze me.  I will watch the rest of your career from afar and will always wish you well.  As a gay woman with 2 young sons, aged 9 and 7, you inspire me.  To my sons - you are actually their hero.

B000HEWEE4|5.0|love this movie i watch it at least once every two or three months.I had one but loaned it out and never got it back
B007VT6QSI|1.0|this version of believe normally brings a dvd, but when it arrived here it wasn't. i felt so sad. how could you arrange it?
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's just really awesome. So addicting. Pretty sure I could play this game all day, everyday for like a month.
B00BHMF578|1.0|Really choppy and blurry. Not even on par with my streaming netflix shows... Couldnt keep watching. Will be requesting a refund.

B004FRX0MY|4.0|I installed this App on both a Samsung smart phone and tablet.  Initially, I found the instructions a little confusing.  It proved to be better understood if being installed on the device that you intend to use it with.  While I still have some questions about the use of this App, I like it because it allows me to play my music I have stored on the Amazon Cloud Drive without taking up the limited storage space on both devices.  An imporvement in the instructions would be to state that you need to down load the App with the device on which you intend to use it.  So far it is working well without too much difficulity.
B009I2UH2W|4.0|I purchased this item after reading many reviews.  It came, as promised, in 2 days.  It appears to work well, although I can't say I have tried it on a trip yet, having had my new phone for only a week.  The light that the others commented about does not seem to me like it will cause a problem, but that is in part because of the placement of my outlet.  The plug does fit tightly into the opening in my car, but I see that as a plus - it won't wriggle out when I move the phone!  I look forward to going on a trip and really testing this charger out!<br /><br />3/25/13 - UPDATE - I had used the charger once and as I stated above, it worked great.  However, the next time I went to use it, it didn't work.  I have since tried it in another car, just to be sure.  Nothing.  Nada.  Dead.  So much for spending a little more to get a better product.  Buyer, beware!.
B00A7ZWUJC|4.0|Eclectic body of music....beautiful...her best work yet..soft & hard at the same time.<br />Can reach a diverse audience...love it...can listen to it over and over again.

B009AMALLM|4.0|This was a pretty good movie. It tied up the first three movies but didn't really offer anything new as far as the scares go. Hoepfully they don't make another unless it has a fresh take on this genre of horror movies.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|amazingg game. I'm addicted to it. this game keeps my attention and challenges me constantly. thank you rovio for another great game.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This game is great! You can put puzzles together in various sizes and difficulties.The best part about this game is being able to put together puzzles anytime you like without losing pieces or taking up space in your home. It is a great way to chill. I personally listen to music while I do a puzzle to relax. The app also offers a nice variety of and many pictures free with the option to purchase more if desired. Too fun!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|great art work. fun searches a little too short play.  not sure if I want to pay 5 bucks to complete game
B0086700CM|5.0|Love, love, love this game! (And I am pretty selective about my game playing.) Totally should have downloaded it sooner.
B0050CQY1W|3.0|The case was cracked when I received it, but the cd was intact. It was on time and arrived promptly
B0030N3O8Y|5.0|Gripping plot. Fine acting.  Chloe finally gets to run CTU. See it! Adding words because I cannot get out of this review otherwise...
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|My favorite movie ever I love it. It's a must see and worth the buy. My daughter and me watch it all time.

B007T2XC7A|4.0|Bought this cd as a gift for a friend. For a better review read the reviews above and below me.
030758836X|5.0|Gone Girl is the story of a missing woman, and the (suspicious) husband who doesn’t seem to be overly concerned … or is it?  Just as I believed I had unraveled the mystery and arrived at a conclusion, the author shifted the point of view midway through the book, completely changing my perception of the main characters and my previous assumptions.  The novel picked up speed, hurtling toward an ending that is abupt, and at first, I was disappointed and felt as if the author had abandoned the story.  However, when I realized that Flynn’s characters weren’t going to be changed for the better and that my sense of justice might not prevail, I could appreciate the author’s intent—to tell a story that kept me guessing, turning pages furiously, all the while suppressing the desire to peek at the ending.  Flynn writes with an amazing attention to detail, providing an endlessly twisting plot and characters that are so flawed the reader cannot help but react to them.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Love the packaging; love the movies; loved sharing it with my son for the 'next generation'!<br />Recommend this to anyone that loves sci-fi
B003UBTX6S|2.0|I loved the first book Beautiful Creatures. I couldn't put the book down and wanted to uncover all the mysteries. What a disappointment Beautiful Darkness is. It just drags a long and you begin to hate all the characters you loved in book one. I don't care to read the rest of the series.
0385341008|5.0|If this review and the promise of exquisite scenery, intelligent conversation, wry flirtations, and heartening nostalgia found within the pages of The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society won't convince you to give the book a try, I don't know what will.<br /><br />Told completely in descriptive letters, amusing telegrams, and exclusive marginal notes, this modern British classic details the lives and events of post-World War II civilians, particularly in bomb-raided London and the recently liberated Channel Islands. The backdrop is extraordinarily well set, with eye-opening and little-known flashes of war terror mingled with depressing, but rich details of Guernsey's isolation under the prolonged German occupation during the war (which lasted until 1945). Both the tempestuous German reign and the brief evocations of the Belsen concentration camps are horrific, but they contrast magnificently with the gorgeous portraits of post-war Guernsey.<br /><br />Dawsey Adams finds the name and address of budding war commentator and novelist, Juliet Ashton, in a book he's acquired secondhand, and seeing that the particular title--a Charles Lamb classic--is well worn, he decides to write her expressing his admiration for the author and complimenting her taste. He doesn't expect Juliet to respond--she doesn't know who he is, after all--but with her spirit and partiality towards literature, she does--enthusiastically. And thus they embark on an exciting, sparkling correspondence.<br /><br />Shaffer has breathed life into her delightful, vivid cast of characters. Dawsey, Sidney, Isola, Susan, the late Elizabeth, and young Kit--I fell in love with all of them! They're simply enchanting... such a diverse, memorable group. I want to see more like them in fiction, and frankly, more like them in real life!<br /><br />Juliet is so my favorite. Rebellious, lovable, and charismatic, she marches to her own drum and has a satirical approach to everything. She's the perfect blend of compassion, angst, and irony, and I absolutely loved her as well. She may, from the viewpoints of her elders, have misplaced priorities and be rather reckless with her actions, but she is fiercely stubborn--fiercely passionate--and that's what makes her such a sensational person.<br /><br />When introduced to a magical literary community, Juliet is able to free her inhibitions and revel in what she knows best and devotes to the most: books. She brings out the book lover in all of us, and her engagement with the Society poignantly demonstrates the marvelous escapism of books. Guided by the wisdom of literary heros like Austen and Lamb, her and the other members' lives, once crossed, will be changed forever. This book is perfect for those who love and are awed by the power of the written word--the power it has to bring people together.<br /><br />I pathetically clung on to every word; stylistically and structurally, not one sentence is out of place. With smooth narration and keen insight, The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is a delightful escape with luscious facets of history and immaculate observations that will immerses readers completely. A modern adaptation of a time-revered romance, it has the witticisms and hopeful predictability that is universally reminiscent in any era and any upbringing.<br /><br />Here is a book to read again and again, and to cherish for a long time to come. It isn't just about the wonder of reading and friendship; it's about finding light in wartime, finding peace in destruction. It's about true love--true identity--and it delivers a quintessential message about humanity that we all ought to keep in mind: that in love, sometimes pride is a far, far bigger crime than prejudice.<br /><br />Pros: Highly evocative in setting // Bright, endearing characters that I want to take home with me // Beautifully written, from multiple vibrant perspectives // Quaint British tone--my favorite! // Humorous // Memorable // Starry and stunningly romantic // Will appeal even to those who don't like historical novels; buoyant and chronicled, rather than dense and dull // Shrewd in emotional bearing // Heart-warming; a 100% feel-good read<br /><br />Cons: The first few pages are a bit difficult to follow because you don't know who's who, but gradual character descriptions clear this up immediately // It ended!!!!<br /><br />Love: \\"We clung to books and to our friends; they reminded us that we had another part to us.\\"<br /><br />Verdict: The miraculous effect of arts and culture, and the appreciation of literature and storytelling--and they way they both shape us humans--is luminously presented in The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society. Expressive, magical, and utterly remarkable, this epistolary narrative is, in one breath, charming with sharp penetration and irresistible perspective. In between the suppression of grief-struck war memories and slow recuperation, is a beautifully refreshing, dazzling, and hopeful reminder that in stories--on paper and in pen--people live and love on. In Juliet's own words: \\"The war is now the story of our lives, and there's no denying it.\\" So too with this novel.<br /><br />Rating: 10 out of 10 hearts: I'm speechless; this book is an extraordinarily amazingly wonderfully fantastically marvelous masterpiece.<br /><br />Source: Complimentary copy provided by TripFiction in exchange for an honest and unbiased review (thank you!).ningly romantic // Will appeal even to those who don't like historical novels; buoyant and chronicled, rather than dense and dull // Shrewd in emotional bearing // Heart-warming; a 100% feel-good read<br /><br />Cons: The first few pages are a bit difficult to follow because you don't know who's who, but gradual character descriptions clear this up immediately // It ended!!!!<br /><br />Love: \\"We clung to books and to our friends; they reminded us that we had another part to us.\\"<br /><br />Verdict: The miraculous effect of arts and culture, and the appreciation of literature and storytelling--and they way they both shape us humans--is luminously presented in The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society.

B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|pretty good game.  there is a slow response when touching areas to open or select.  the areas for searching objects is small.
B005LAIISA|1.0|I have watched and enjoyed the first 2 movies and thought this would be just as entertaining. Wrong, yanked the Btu-Ray right outa the player after a half hour. Movie was made for the sake of selling tickets.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway Surfers is the one of the best games I have Played!If you don't have this game I recommend getting it.Subway Surfers is a great GAME!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Found a way to keep in touch with old friends,  family & share photos& life experiences - does what I need it to do
B00B3MN65K|4.0|I've heard much better from him. I put three stars because of his talent, not necessarily the album. it isn't terrible and everyone's taste is different, so if you love Josh too, then it's worth a listen! there are a few songs I love.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|Before i review Pines, I just wanted to confess that I really enjoy Blake's stories and I really looked forward to this book. Maybe I went into it with expectations and they werent realized. I may need to reread it<br /><br />When I started Pines, I didn't know up from down. This book leaves you guessing until the end. In my opinion, I don't think this is Blake's best book and it wasnt really what I had expected but, with that said, it was still a good book full of detailed writing. Some sections of the book were a little slow and it made this a difficult read for me. Maybe I am way off base here because I have heard that Hollywood is optioning Pines for TV.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Thought this was overall a good book but at times it was hard to really get into if it had more action it would be amazing
B007SGM084|5.0|I love these books.  The first is by far my favorite.  The story really hits home in it.  I'm glad I got the trilogy the first one leaves with too much emotional hanging not to continue reading.  I'd recommend this book to my fifty shades and to all people on need of learning how to seduce.
B009K0P10K|5.0|It grabs you and keeps you sucked throughout the program! I would love to get caught up to continue watching on TV this year. Except I will have a hard time waiting a week between shows!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Love it! So very entertaining and comical. Love the tattoos and facial expressions. The wardrobe is great too! A must watch for Sherlock fans!!!
0385360177|5.0|Love the peson narrating this book. Done extremely well. Can't wait until I get book # 3 on CD also!
B004I8WD6E|4.0|I have it for over 9 months now. Snaps on so perfect that it may be a little hard to get it out. But does the job, and I liked the look...though the color tends to yellow a bit as it ages.
B0042MDAL8|5.0|OMG! I bought this one along with all the others because it was on sale and I just had to have them all! =)
B005LAIHPY|5.0|Each time I watch this movie, I love it even more than the time before. I believe it only suffers from a &#34;poor to fair&#34; opening act. One the war games begin, this is a truly great movie. Remember, it's not trying to be the next great social commentary- it's a fun summer popcorn movie- and more. The acting is very good- including the razzie malligned Riahna- I know nothing of her music, but I thought she was great in this. I especially enjoyed the storyline of the  of the American and Japanese commanders.The &#34;Art of War&#34; references were hilarious. The script was well done, save the opening sequences. Finally, the special efects were absolutely spectacular. ILM made great strides in presenting photo quality realistic war ships. The ships are patterned after water bug- brilliantly done! The aliens appearance was well done- not great, but very good. The uniforms (space suits) are spectacular. GREAT MOVIE!
B000HKYA1I|5.0|Excellent movie; captures the interest of the viewer both at a serious and comedic level with superior acting and storyline. My wife is Ukranian and she thoroughly loved the movie.
1932735410|5.0|If you are looking to take the exam by July 2013, this is the book for you. After that PMBOK 5 will be used, so this will no longer be adequate. Until then, though, this is the book to go for. The tone is excellent, there is focus on areas that you are likely to overlook, examples are great and so are the end of chapter tests. At one stage, I began reading the PMBOK 4, but I must admit that took me a step back. I re-read the Rita book and was back on track for the exam again.<br />There are 2 areas that I found wanting in the book - there aren't enough examples on the topics of Critical Path method of Schedule Analysis and Earned Value Analysis. So once you study these topics from the book(which you should), look for ways to supplement your knowledge on these topics from some other place.<br />All in all, I would still give the book a 5 star. The best part is that I did not memorize inputs/tools/outputs of each process area; I understood them logically.
B008BM9L72|5.0|the books kept getting better.  It was wonderful writing as there was a solid storyline as well and it wasn't all about the sex the further you read into the trilogy.  Not that the sexiness wasn't a pleasure trip also.
B000JCSBU0|2.0|Too little plot and character development (rather shallow), and a generally depressing movie.  This was all rather predictable as well.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|When Craig made his debut as the famous James Bond I was skeptical. I was expecting the movie casino royale to be a flop. By the time Quantum of solace reared its  head, I was hooked. Now comes skyfall. The third of the Craig installment to the Bond franchise. by far, it was Craigs best work yet, both from the bond series, and his other excellent works such as Defiance, Golden Compass, Invasion and so on. Skyfall goes into the heart and soul of the man JAMES BOND; not just as an agent, but a tormented soul who has lost his way. We see into the man, not just the agent, and at the same time see into the M character personna as well.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|A real eye opener<br /><br />The world needs to know about the people in these camps and what a horrible existence it is.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Great book.  As a doctor myself, I am glad he wrote it.  It's good to have some proof from a scientific person. Hope everyone enjoy this book and several books on this topic.
B00BETX5PS|2.0|James Bond is no longer relevant.  Sean Connery was the best Bond; Daniel Craig not very realistic as Bond.  Maybe the character should be retired.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|A difficult read and ca<br /><br />n't imagine seeing it on film. However I do plan on viewing the movie in the near future, especially after seeing film clips on the Oscars.
B007L5GDGW|1.0|The ball does not respond fast enough, and it is tough to see the exact height of the ball. Fixing these two things might make it better.
B00382S9TQ|5.0|great show you want somthing great to watch get all seasons of this show its one of the best hbo shows ever
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game has a lot of fun levels. I also reccomend flow bridges. It is just like flow but you can cross at a point.
B0092MKTL2|5.0|Saw them live, and even though they weren't the headliner (Fun was), they were my favorite act of the night.  This album combines runs from upbeat (I'm on top of the World) to dark (Bleeding out) to what can only be described as Aggressively Hopeful (RADIOACTIVE).  This is the band's first full length album, and between the heavy percussion, clever lyrics, and 80's undertones, they scored a gazillion points on the awesomeness scale.  I searched out some of the songs that didn't make the album, and they are outstanding.  The fact that they didn't make the cut for the album reinforces the quality of all the tracks start to finish.  &#34;It's Time&#34; is their big radio-friendly hit, and it ranks towards the bottom in my rankings of the tracks on this album.<br /><br />I usually don't buy music, preferring to listen to internet radio apps, but I like this group so much I felt the need to support them by purchasing the album.  I'm glad I did it- go do likewise.
0684857219|5.0|This book is filled with knowledge when it comes to working out. Also not just strictly bodybuilding but different routines and info for people with all different goals they want to achieve in their fitness.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|My daughhter talked me into watching this movie.  I was very surprized how much I really liked it. I would reccomend it for a family movie night.
B00122S4KS|5.0|Great music for a great price. It's a digital album so there's really not much else to say. I love the band so obviously it's a good buy.
B004LE7PCM|5.0|A thoroughly enjoyable series. Despite its length, over 1800 pages, I found it hard to put down. If your a fan of the Sherlock mini series then you'll love this collection. One of my favourite purchases from Amazon.
B001ANSSDC|2.0|This is the first book that I've read where I thought the movie would definitely be better than the book. The story was very interesting, but the writing style was horrible and extremely simplistic. If it weren't for the adult content, I would recommend it to be on a reading list for second graders.
B0039OC64M|3.0|Seemed like a low budget movie but, really strikes the imagination about what society could and does become when big brother becomes too, big and powerful.
0894803123|5.0|Has alot of great tips and receipes for the whole family to enjoy. We first did the french vanilla which everyone loves
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It's a poetic reading of an honest story, that connects with intelligence and wit a tale of love, discovery and acceptance, a great look into a vision of facts and plain happenings that both strips the pain and eases the parting of emotion, a heavy cry but a cry of understanding...
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Loved the book.  Quick, concise, and would recommend this to anyone wanting to get a basic idea in understanding components of nutrition.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game is a good game some times its Hard  to figer  out  burnished lots of fun I give it I four
B007L5GDGW|2.0|Jeeze, I expected it to be fun at first but the marble is so hard to control!!!!!so in the first minute I started playing I've already HATED everything about the dumb game. I gave it 2 stars only for the graphics. (that's the only cool part of the game in my opinion)  CAUTION: IF BOUGHT YOU MIGHT SUFFER FROM EXTREME  BOREDOM AND IRRITATION.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game.good graphics good controls great missions ,very addictive for a free game would highly recommend this game .<br />All ages would enjoy this product .
1609611543|5.0|Excellent book! Loved the layout and ease of reading. Would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get the reasons for unexplained \\"belly\\" weight and/or health conditions in an easy read, factual format.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson DeMille never fails to entertain. Dialogue is laugh out loud funny. Main character is extra sarcastic and the plot is good. Don't skip this book!  A must read !!
B00498YZH8|5.0|Every aspect of WInter's Bone, from the players, to the script, and to the location are almost haunting.  It's a movie you won't forget.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book proves , just how insightful and caring our pets can be . The special qualities of dogs and their  ability to bring people together are pointed out in this book
B009B2VBWE|5.0|Love this new sound for DK. She's a great talent and look forward to new material.  She and Eva Cassidy are my two favorite singers.  Can't get enough of these gals.
0385528752|5.0|To be short:<br /><br />Data-rich argument that shows riders need to pull at the heart for real change to occur.<br /><br />A bit longer:<br /><br />Switch has been my bedside read for the past couple of weeks. Its very rich and intense use of data makes it better to absorb in small bits - one day at a time. For anyone who wishes to make great change on a large level in an organization needs to read this book.<br /><br />It's amazing how often I see myself thinking in terms of the elephant and the rider. Working in education, there's a level of bureaucracy that can be overbearing; and with the logic that the Heath's provide, switching the ideas of key influencers is getting a bit easier. One day at a time.<br /><br />-Mark<br />Educator / Change Agent<br />[...]
B00AREIAI8|5.0|thought this was going to be dumb but i bought it because it was free but i really enjoy it, graphics are surprisingly good

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a very good game and its something like temple run but the problem is that there is no where to go
B003PIUBZS|1.0|Three out of the four disc were so degrated you could not watch them. They would stop and cut off .
B000Y7U98C|3.0|This is one of those films (or music albums or books or...) that truly divides public opinion, but my middle-ground comments and rating are not due to any fear off raking in \\"unhelpfuls\\", but rather reflects the fact that I'm very divided myself. On the one hand, I'm sorry, but Brian Cox's strained attempts to find wiggle room in the plot just don't work for me. Much of the plot an the set-ups for that story line are to my mind simply silly, starting with the notion of reigniting the sun with a fission bomb. Forget it. Many other negative observations made by others are also valid, but I don't intend to waste time repeating all of them here. Some can refuted or mitigated -- I can agree with arguments about the crew breaking down psychologically, and the Earthly view of the reignition as an artistic metaphor -- but some can't, in my view. These failures of logic or simply scientific fact do weaken the film. But on the other hand, the film brilliantly conveys the confrontation with an unknowable yet sentient and presumably malevolent force, an otherness that is truly unnerving. That's no mean feat, and one that deserves to be appreciated. There are plenty of science fiction films -- or books or short stories, for that matter -- whose premise has turned out to be a bit ridiculous, or which never was reasonable in the first place, but those works of art or craft in many cases still retain power despite their flaws. So it is for me with this film. I suspend what disbelief I can and ignore what can't be suspended, focusing instead on the movie's wonderful depiction of that malevolent or indifferent other. And that boosts this film from one star to three. For me, anyway.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|Instructs all of us how dignity and preparation help us face adversity.<br />Intensity and sensitivity of the directing affected us.
B00602MRAI|5.0|very romantic and from the core of the artist's soul. my boyfriend loved this as his xmas gift. spell bound.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I was reluctant to read this because I am a poor runner and was not enthused about reading of other more gifted runners. But on the urging of two friends I did and I was glad I did. Runner or not this is a good story and if you are a runner you will likely be inspired.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|This has to be one of the five best seasons of any show ever. Completely underrated because \\"it's not cool\\" to watch PBS.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Mystery, history and fantasy all rolled into one. Familiar creatures with a new twist.  Looking forward to the next one.
B0063GORYU|5.0|this is a great game. I enjoy playing this solitaire version. I only enjoy a few solitaire games but Spider is one of my favorites.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|The movie illustrates our anxiety about others of different cultures.  At least it kept us awake.  The ending although &#34;happy&#34; included a none existant chase between automobiles and a jet airplane, strictly hollywood.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like it but whenever I use it in the car I have to earase it so it's OK but not GREAT
B003JTHXOK|5.0|EXCELLENT BOOK.. Good story of love being triumphant! Highly recommend it. Can't wait to see the movie . 2 thumbs up!!!
B005LAJ1O0|1.0|i am so excited to recieve my season one of american horror story but it says it should have been here by feb 22 and it is now march 4th
B007L5GDGW|4.0|REALLY COOL GAME TO PLAY AND LOTS OF MIND ACTION HOPE THIS HEELS WHO WANTS TO BUY THIS GAME THANKS
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow Free I love it! It seems to me I am always playing it!! Its like you can't stop! You want to master all the levels in one day!!
B00884GR0W|4.0|This game is great because its combine between minecraft and a role playing game (rpg). worth its price for sure.
B0087ZG7HK|4.0|Excellent video. The kids love it as much as I do.Showed it at school too.It never gets old.Amazing animation, good acting
B000TSUCAQ|5.0|I got this for my son and nephew for Christmas they love them we have been cooking from this for years now
B005J4ASDG|5.0|Although many avid fans of Howard Shore's music to the Lord of the Rings will certainly enjoy this, I believe this is the perfect album for those who love the movies and their music but are not particular about hearing every cue and square inch of the score, which is a dauntingly long listen. As all the great themes keep going in and out, I can &#34;see&#34; the movies progressing from start to finish at a surprisingly pleasant pace, despite plowing through all three in less than two hours. Often I am bored by movie soundtracks, waiting for the great themes and moments here and there while drudging through a lot of filler that isn't terribly amazing without the film accompanying it. It is impossible for me to separate images of the film while listening to this, but I honestly feel that these arrangements are a fine musical telling of the story that stands alone from the film itself. Perhaps only someone who listens to this before watching the movies can confirm or deny that claim, but how many of those people will buy this? Bottom line: A wonderful, captivating and nostalgic listen, capturing all the great moments from the film score without requiring a full day's worth of time.
B001EBV0NA|5.0|I saw this movie in the 70's and it scared me to death.  Today in comparison to some of the movies out.. this was still top notch.  I often wonder what this movie would of been like if they would of had the CGI's and all the other tricks of the trade they have today.  The producers and writers of the Exorcist were way ahead of their time... it's still scary and creepy.  Leaves a person feeling uneasy for sure.  Awesome movie.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|Not as good as Kite Runner, but still a wonderful read. Khaled writes beautifully, in a way that really makes you feel like you know the characters.  I say it's not as good as Kite Runner only because I liked the story of the two boys' relationship and how it developed better than the story of these two women...that's all.  This story is just as touching and suspenesful and sad.
B000FCK65W|5.0|I loved this book. Could hardly put it down.  It could only have been written by someone who had lived it or at least been aware of the poor in that time.
B0055IU4GM|5.0|Best album I bought in 2012.  I am not normally a Hiatt fan, but he nailed it this time.  Great songs!
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Just watched the first season of this show. Thought it was really good! I still think SG1 is better but this one contains the sense of camaraderie and honor as SG1. (SGU was not very enjoyable because of too much in-fighting, dishonesty and such.) Characters are likeable and you feel empathy to them.<br /><br />Good acting. Lot of good special effects. Engaging storyline which keeps you interested. Most of the sets are great, while you occasionally see aspects that don't seem to fit.<br /><br />As in most cases, there are situations where you wonder why some questions are not addressed. Then again, this is science fiction and some suspension of belief is required. Seriously. This is a series about modern people using an ancient device built by an advanced civilization millenia ago to travel to the far end of the universe to arrive at Atlantis, which turns out to be on a different planet. While intelligently written, don't over-analyze<br /><br />Very much worth watching!.
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|Solid music from a real pro.  More &#34;blues&#34; than his last album.  It is not the Animals, but Paul McCartney alone is not the Beatles.
1616550414|5.0|Love the book, even have the japanese version (I thought a translation would never come), I only wish it wasn´t that focused on the latest games, but nonetheless a must for The legend of zelda fans!
B008IBP24C|5.0|I don't normally like British TV, but I was addicated from the very first show.  I hadn't even heard of the show until the week before the season finale of season 3, but I quickly caught up, thanks in part to it being available on Amazon.
B000002LND|2.0|3 of the song not only skip but get stuck! i have to go to the next song and skip over the ones
B007SUW24W|5.0|I listen to this cd every day it has some of the best song on it. Anyone that love a kinda heart touching pop jazzy up tone music get this cd u will love it also.
0061564893|5.0|The superiority of the Chinese culture of that age was never pointed out to me in such detail, and that they collapsed in such a short period of  time is astonishing. My question is, what empire will be next to fall? And why?
0448444216|5.0|I bought this for work (I teach special education) and it has worked exactly as I expected in my classroom.  It is a classic story that is engaging and predictable for students with special needs to follow after repeated readings.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|If you like intrigue, this show is for you! There are characters you love and others you love to hate! It will shock you and enthrall you and make you want more!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love this game at carnival.. this is a cheap way to play...would like to have another way of earning coins so i can play for longer periods
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|They are angry and they are annoyed to the point of rage and they are avians. Those swine really ire me.
B00168OIP8|4.0|Cruises earlier movies were very decent, this being my favorite. But his current movies, forget it. Personally, they are terrible.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Somewhere between a stock basic calculator and a robust scientific one. I do use squares and roots in my job, and now I don't have to drag my &#34;big boy&#34; calculator for much of my work.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I love that book, it was a revelation... I really recommand it, even if you don't have faith, it will change your vision of life.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Even though I knew the story from having lived through this period in history, I found I was holding my breath for the last 30 minutes of &#34;Argo&#34; and probably would have benefited from having an oxygen tank close by to my chair. This movie was fantastic, and Ben Affleck was incredible, as were all the actors in this fine film, notably Alan Arken and John Goodman. An all-around outstanding movie.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Got this app as the free app of the day some months ago and it's just leaps and bounds better than the stock keyboards. Definitely would have paid for it if I hadn't gotten it for free.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|The movie arrived on time as a surprise for my hubby. He loves it and so does our son! Very Happy!
0385536828|3.0|Ian McEwan is about the only author I will pre order and read regardless of reviews.  Certainly my favorite living author.  However, this novel was quite unsatisfying from a plot and character perspective and was solely redeemed by his mastery of the English language.  I never fully believed in the central character in the same way I have done with just about every other protagonist in his previous works.  While Atonement explored the author's view of storytelling, \\"truth\\" and recollection it did so in a way that didn't detract from a compelling narrative.  The plot in this novel never held my attention perhaps because I never believed in the main character and it was so transparently a vehicle for a reflection of the author's view of the craft of writing. Once that became clear to me it was all I could do to struggle through to an ending that might have been more exciting had it not been neutered by what had gone before.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Let this book bring you back to young love and hopelessness and all of the in between. Could not put this down. Must read.
0896760278|5.0|it came on time and it was everything I needed it to be. It was in good condition and provided information regarding my fiancee's project.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I was kind of sketched out about buying this book and reading it after reading all of the negative reviews, but besides all that, I bought it anyway.  I thought that it was just captivating enough to keep me reading and to make me want to read the other books in the series, but it wasn't a read-it-in-two-days kind of thing.  It was a little simple, but I still enjoyed it.  It is a tad reminiscent of other books, but I really didn't mind that either.  I think the thing that bothered me the most about this book, and subsequent ones, was the font.
0545425115|4.0|I didn't read this book until after I had seen the movie, and while the movie was good, the book was even better (as is usually the case).  Can't wait to read the other 2 in the series.
B00B2QA2F4|4.0|Rza should've got his iron fists much earlier in the movie.  That was my only beef with the movie.  Looking forward to more Kung Fu movies from the Rza.
030758836X|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and all of its twists!  It was dark and disturbing, but in a very entertaining way.  Every time I thought I had it all figured out, something would happen to change my mind.  Fascinating read.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|One of our favorite shows. it inspired me to go back and read the original complete works of Sherlock Holmes again,
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I purchased this dvd for my Dad for Father's Day after seeing it at the theater.  I was pleasantly surprised at how great this movie was, considering it was technically a Christian film & not mainstream.  This movie really touched me & I ended up purchasing a copy for myself as well.  It has such a good storyline, and I've found with many other Christian movies that they don't always portray &#34;real life&#34; situations, everything is too perfect to believe and tied up in a neat little bow, which just isn't realistic.  This movie, on the other hand, dealt with REAL life situations in a realistic way that we can all relate to.  This was a wonderful, wonderful movie!
B00A9T1HUO|2.0|Nothing in particular. Just disappointing from his previous albums.  Did his producer change?  I will be curious to see what others have to say.  I have been wrong in the past.
B00271DNP4|4.0|Being able to browse and download movies from the comfort of your couch is awesome.  After my son finished the book he naturally wanted to see the movie. So much fun pointing out the differences between each. As all of.the movies in this series, engrossing for both parent and child. Loved it.
1556853734|5.0|I'm a Christie fan from way back. Having my books on CD is wonderful. They are well narrated and entertaining - and I can do housework while I am listening to my favorite author. Thanks!
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book gets you interested in the mystery quickly, but soon you figure it out and want the girl gone.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|The BBT is by far the best show in TV today and by a long shot. While others try to numb our nation with completely idiotic content, this is challenging and whitty! Thanks!!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am a sucker for love stories and this one just completely finalized the whole reason behind it. For 2 hearts to be separated but have that connection is so unbelievable, for the heartbreaking yet revitalized ending to a story like theirs is utterly beautiful. To have a love like that is to actually live. Such an amazing book, a definite must read!! Just grab a box of tissues and settle in...you won't want to put this one down.
B0053O89JM|5.0|I can totally relate to the zynical Dr. House - who is living in pain. I find him engaging, despite his nasty attitude - though I would not like to know him in real life. :-) I love the story line that is intelligent and whitty - I would like to thank the people that wrote the dialogs, they are really clever!
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|Watched it because my husband wanted to see it and we are fans of the original. This was an excellent film. Story kept me right on the edge of the seat the whole time.
B004YM6JLO|3.0|Story is cheesy, characters shallow - but Damon, you are sooooo hot! Gotta have to see them all once you started, just like a bag of chips. You know it's not good for you, but you eat them anyway.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|I am not a Kristen Stewart fan. And I was not sure how I would like a fairy tale action movie. This was a great movie! Action, good story line, and great acting. I love this movie.
1572703253|5.0|I'm a great Christie fan from way back, and having the books on CD is simply wonderful! Well read, thanks.
B002QW7AJY|3.0|It starts out slow but it picks up and the twist are just crazy. If you can make it thru the first 20 mins it's worth it.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|The BBT is by far the best show in TV today and by a long shot. While others try to numb our nation with completely idiotic content, this is challenging and whitty! Thanks!!!!
B007FEZQF8|1.0|the book was fine on my kindle but for some reason the book is not windows 8 compatible for reading on my laptop. is this normal for image comics? I can read /view a preview on amazons page but not the book I paid for.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I just love the BBT - best show in TV in a long time and by a long shot! Can't wait to see what happens next to Leonard and Penny, Sheldon, Raj and Howard.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I can't say anything without giving away to the reader. The book should be sold with a kleenex packet included. Loved the book and have recommended it to my book club.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The Season 2 starts out slow but then it picks up quickly and has just enough drama, love, action and lots of storylines.  Love this series and can't get enough of it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Perfect for my Kindle Fire. Very good game and I enjoy it very much. I wish I could find one this good for my phone.
B001CMSTBM|4.0|Good rocking! Solid first release, you can tell that the bad is serious about their music. Follow up with getting their album Firewater you won't be disappointed!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Entertainingly warm story of a small group of charming and realistic characters in 1970's Ireland. Laughed out loud throughout but was also touched by the harsher side of the fact-based story.
B008TTPQXA|5.0|i enjoyed this book as it  lets you think of your journey after our earth one<br />it gives you another person insight and it made me think of loved ones already gone in a happy way
B003E8P9G0|5.0|If you liked the Percy Jackson series than you will definitely like this. Same concept, evil forces, gods, and teenagers. Except not Greek this time but instead Egyptian. Really fun.
B000SW2ER2|3.0|A sequel to 2001?  I never quite &#34;got&#34; it, but I am told a couple of more viewings and all will become clear.
B000069HJI|5.0|Probably would list this lp fifth after the prior 4 releases not including the live Paris disc. Upon more listening the songs are catchy and they grow on you. The last two tracks are classic supertramp(Don't leave me now & Waiting so long) in the same vein as crime of the century and child of vision. Too bad egos of musicians get in the way of fans pleasure. Who wrote what, so what, music was good while it lasted!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The streaming quality was excellent and the sound quality was perfect!! Plus you can't beat the price. Much better than watching a DVD.
B000YHG72E|3.0|Good Family movie at Christmas time.  Would not watch it any other time.  Kind of stupid, but kids think it is super funny.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|The streaming quality was excellent and the sound quality was perfect!! Plus you can't beat the price. Much better than watching a DVD.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|Not sure what all the hype was...  glad I rented and didn't see it in the theater.  Good home rental - excellent Amazon quality.
B000OCXFCO|3.0|again late but I love it . . . . . .  . .  . . . . . .
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|For a TV series, this show rates pretty fairly as far as horror shows go. Its not all that scary but it does give good creeps. Jessica Lang is phenomenal!
B000000H3Z|3.0|. . . . . . . . . .  love it but it was late . .. . . . . . . . . . .
B00445RHKI|5.0|What's not to like about one of the best series on TV! Love this season and if you're a fan or the show, or just tuning in, you'll love it too!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved the book, but the ending just ends abruptly -upsetting and disappointing. I wish there was more of an ending to it!!
B005OP2928|5.0|If you loved Modern Family Seasons 1 & 2, Season 3 won't fall short of meeting your highest expectations. Enjoy the best family sitcom out there!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|what could ever be more wonderful than Bocellil  It is a voice from deep within.  He is the most perfect.
B00005JO9J|5.0|Mc Dreamy, Mc Steamy .....I am going to buy every season one at a time.  When you watch these shows on tv....they seem to jump around alot and I wanted to make sure that I have seen every episode.
1451695195|5.0|His journey touched my soul. It almost knocked me over that a scientist could share his view of heaven and God. Upon finishing the book, I felt both more at peace about my departed loved ones and, at the same time, excited about the journey I will one day take. A must-read for any doctor who has patient-relationships that matter.
B00B2DSIAI|4.0|My 3 year old liked it. We have watched it probably 6 times so far. It entertained me the first couple of times. More entertaining than I thought it would be.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Really enjoying this and think it will really be handy for my Kindle. Especially like the large screen and enjoy the fact that I can use it on a trip. The Alarm is another good option.
B0094K1MH2|3.0|I thought it was decent but my 3 year old wasn't into it, which meant I couldn't finish watching it. I will re-watch it when she's not around, not because I'm really into it but because I have to watch a whole movie when I begin to watch it.
0679746323|5.0|It's a testament to the international success of the Chinese Communist Party's propaganda that even now you can find educated readers calling for a more sympathetic treatment of Mao.  Chang's astonishingly researched and well-sourced bio of her subject is scathing because Mao had no qualities or accomplishments worth defending.  He was a psychopathic mass murderer whose one and only interest was accumulating personal power, and he enthusiastically butchered tens of millions of his people to that end.  He united China after a civil war (of which he was a primary instigator) in the same way all dictators capitalize on turmoil to attain totalitarian rule - he was no more valid a savior than Napoleon or Hitler.  Not one of his economic or industrialization drives produced anything of value.  Industrialization and economic modernization in China got under way after Mao's death, and they occurred in spite of, not because of, his policies, and only after his idiotic forced labor schemes were buried with him.<br /><br />Chang's book, aside from being a damn good read, is important because it documents not just Mao but the severe thrashing political idealism took in the twentieth century at the hands of China and the Soviet Union.  The socialist goliaths took a philosophy of worker control and democracy and twisted it to create a slave society diametrically opposed to Marx while capitalizing on the moral authority of his name.  They guided every communist country down the same path.  Egalitarian politics have been bearing the stain ever since, and unlike the right, leftists haven't been able to disassociate themselves from their monstrous mid-century cousins.  Mao's infliction of misery extends past his lifetime and past China.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Easy to play but tricky at times to get the three stars. I like this game for something to play while waiting for doctors, planes, and any other time I have 15 minutes or so to play. Addictive. Many levels to choose from and works great on the kindle fire HD.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I liked this book, it was fast pace and kept me reading on, but I am not sure I am intrigued enough to read the other two. I generally like where they are going with the story, if it was just one book, I would have totally been okay with it. So it will be interesting to read the other two.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very good!!! I can't wait to start book two! Couldn't put it down. It was definitely racy though. Cliff hanger at the end too
B00000K2W1|5.0|Janis's best songs all together. No one sounded like her, and they still don't! Takes me back to college and seeing her perform live.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|Using Amazon stylus to type, right now! Comfortable to use, appears to be good quality. Hopefully tips will last a long time!
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I bought this set of DVDs so that I can rewatch the episodes so that I can revisit the family.  But, actually I bought the set so that I can rewatch Maggie Smith, who is brilliant as the Dowager Countess.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun you will go crazy for this game it is cool and very surprising when you upgrade it because there are different types of themes! :)
B001Q9J4PG|5.0|This is the book that got me into reading Tom Clancy. Such a good and intriguing story. Each terrorist attack is wonderfully written and detailed. This would make a perfect movie really.
0786956291|4.0|It is exactly what it says it is: A starter's set for D&D. The reason I give it four stars instead of five is simple: The quality. I've had the box for about a month, only opened it once and it is already starting to break around the corners. The map is paper. It came folded up so the seams make it difficult to keep your tokens in one spot. Also, it would be great if this set came with some miniatures. Still, it contains everything it says, so no real complaints here.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|always superb, too bad that concert didn't happen. it would have been earth rockin, it was very cool to see all that goes on.
B000068PQ0|5.0|Came on time and in great shape. I am very pleased with this album. If you like The Flaming Lips, you will love this album. It is certainly my favorite that they have ever produced.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|This was a good movie. Although at times I wondered what the plot line really was. There was a lot of action which is what you want in a bond movie but some of the scenes seemed irrelevant and in the end I wasn't sure what this movie was about at all really.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I love my new LifeProof case. It  was so awesome when I  did the water test and there was not a drop of water inside the case.  Beware of counterfeit cases sold by some sellers. My first case was a counterfeit one and it cracked in less than a month with out being dropped or hit.  I would only purchase Lifeproof cases sold and shipped by Amazon or sold and shipped by the  LifeProof Company.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|It's been so interesting watching this from the start.  We all know the cliches, but it's fun to see how the cliches develop.  In this season, while mostly focused on Kirk & Spock, we really begin to see the crew broaden and develop.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|We love this app! my kids also enjoy it. it is challenging and fun for the whole family. I play for hours.
0375704027|5.0|I love this book.  I used to own it, but gave it to a friend.  Bought it here because I wanted to have a copy of it agian.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Very good movie but too much fabricated tension in the ending.  Would have been better without trying to turn the last 15 minutes into a nail biter.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Was a bit skeptical of this show at first since I'm not usually into drama shows, but this program by far exceeds expectations! Superb acting and good pacing.
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|DA3 will end my somewhat enjoyable devotion to Downton Abbey.  I felt that the resolution of the Bates problem was deferred far too long, that Shirley MacLaine was misplaced by at least one ocean's width and that she needed to go home forever; instead this retread actress will be a retread character in DA4, I thought that Carson morphed into a martinet and a prig.  Mrs. O'Brien early identified as a baby-murderer in the soap and the bathtub incident in DA1, seemed to regret her action, only to revert to her hateful self by the end of DA3; consistency of character?  Tom Branson and his love for Lady Sybil was delightful, so it had to be excised.  In that regard, the use of mortality to modify the story was way overdone by Fellowes.  Dan Stevens will be missed, but he will probably be seen again in many excellent Hollywood productions.  I'd like to see him in Ian McKellan's &#34;Sweet Tooth&#34;.  DA3's morph into a Scottish play sucked big time.  Cora Crawley, and Mary have been backbone characters since DA1...consistent, sympathetic, and integral to the story.  I can and will easily live without DA4.
B00APJLFEG|3.0|Entertaining but kinda slow moving... A section in the middle didn't keep my attention. i would  suggest as good for younger kids but not as entertaining as some animated movies for adults.
B002P79KAC|5.0|The dialog is very witty and the situations are not formula style like you see soooo many times<br />you always know what happens next and how it turns out etc.<br /><br />This show is fresh and funny. I recommend it.
B0031R5K8G|5.0|It is a very good book to get a look inside the mind of an autistic person.<br />The language is easy to read and there is explanations of those math equations there are.<br />The chapters are short which make it easy to read.
B004NOH9LC|5.0|Great quality and movie, I started to finally watch movies on amazon prime and am loving it. They offer a huge selection and stream very well. I am a big Harrison Ford fan so this movie was right up my ally.
B00511QI4A|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, a very well written descriptive book that was difficult to put down, the ending was a surprise too!
B007N5YY2K|4.0|A great free preview of the good movie.  In fact, one of the most spectacular scenes in the movie.  This preview will give you a great idea of how this movie flows.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a book that every romantic, fun loving, adventurous girl, boy, man, or woman would love. They that Suzanne Collins bring  our the love in Katniss is a great heart stealing way.<br />The best way to have a kid under the age of 9 read this is by reading it to them. Fun for every girl boy man or woman! Great job Suzanne Collins!
0792843584|1.0|This movie is terrible. Just awful.<br /><br />Let's give credit where it is due. This film looks great. The photography is great and the sets and costumes are great.The picture looks great. But * * *<br /><br />The story of this movie is very poorly told, barely told, really. Here is the story. Some rich guy graduates from Harvard in 1870. He goes west to bring civilization or some such thing to Wyoming. He becomes a law officer in Johnson County, Wy. A bunch of immigrants have moved into the county and become farmers. This upsets the rich cattle interests, because the farmers are taking \\"their\\" land. So the rich guys decides to run the immigrant farmers out of the area, or to just plain kill them. The farmers are a sympathetic group and they are not doing well financially. Many are starving. The cattle men are scum and they are rich. So we have the ingredients for a good movie. But what we get is just awful.<br /><br />Here is why this movie is awful. It takes forever for the movie to make a point, to tell just part of the story, to communicate what is going on. It reminded me of the late comedian Andy Kaufman reading The Great Gatsby to his audiences during his stand up act. The audience hated it because, after a very short time, there was no point to it. That is what Heaven's Gate is all about -- not making a point or taking forever to make a point. This horrible movie just goes on and on and on and on.<br /><br />I could not even figure out why the movie is called Heaven's Gate. There is a roller skating rink in the movie by that name but I can't figure out why that was the film's title. It could just as easily been called Hell's Bells. Or This Movie Smells.<br /><br />Watching this movie is like watching the paint, on a beautiful picture, take forever to dry.
B005CRPB0U|5.0|I have been a fan of the harry potter series since i was 11, i am now 22 and i still find the world within this series extremely enchanting, therefore i was very pleased with this book. What i found even more pleasing were the translations by albus Dumbledore, all in all i enjoyed this book
B007ZXK08C|3.0|This book is a mystery for me. At first you think the husband is a killer! Then you are confront with a very crazy wife who plan everything! Soo she is crazy but the worst part he stays with her! I think is is too much fiction
B0071MDA2U|5.0|I had never heard of Lauren Oliver so glad i bought the books cant wait for the last one to come out
B00APUQH0W|4.0|It can be a family movie and also a kind of chick flick. Nice story line, kind of unique. I gave it four because of Clint Eastwood's performance. Still one of the very best actors around. I liked his role as a baseball agent. (spoiler alert)Most the movie was realistic, (spoiler alert) the only part I would have changed (spoiler alert).......was his daughter discovering a pro level picture.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Well it's different than I thought it would be but it's a little frustrating<br />Sometimes but its challenging and I love a challenge so I LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 5 stars AMAZING

B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love the game but my daughter had erased the game from my kindle fire and when I rebooted the game I lost everything. I had all the trophies all the jet packs and coins ,magnet 99 Huber boards and had unlocked fresh and had 4 different boards . 30k in coins and was maxed out on x30. I was furious. I put a lot of time into this game. I play everyday on the train to work. Very disappointed in this problem. Other then that this game is great. I connected back to Facebook my high score is there but lost everything.please fix this issue and return my things. Lol
B004IJY4L0|5.0|I never thought I'd love an album as much as In Silico, but Immersion embraces Pendulum's exploration into rock without forgetting to hark back to their Drum and Bass roots. It is amazing, buy it now.

0226039331|5.0|After being hesitant to drop the money on this reference work for almost 2 years, I finally gave in and ordered. I must say, I was not disappointed at all. This is an absolute necessity for ANYONE who wants to work through the NT Greek and be faithful to the Biblical text! Just forgo buying a few of the modern Christian books coming out every week and save up to buy this. You will be much more blessed and edified by the years of use you'll get out of this work
B0018RFLN0|4.0|Lots of action. Enjoyed this movie and it had a surprising ending. After watchng tv shows ford many years was dissapointed that Mr Phelp's was the bad guy
B0011UJMK2|5.0|Cold War Soviet Union has always fascinated me, so I was jazzed to hear great things about a book set in those uncertain times. I couldn't put it down, and when I was done, I was pleased that my reading stood up to all the positive things I'd heard. The book is fast paced, thrilling, and absolutely enjoyable. I was left wanting more after reading the final word, and have been recommending it to everyone I know.
B0072GPQNG|3.0|Yes, we know that stories about animals usually are predictible, but this one takes you on an interesting journey along the way.  The Director makes no bones about horsing around with this story--he is trying for a tear jerker, and succeeds with some.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I downloaded a few of the free notebook/memo/diary apps, and decided that this one is the best. You can make different notebooks and customize the icon on the main page. You can set a theme, password protect, download a notebook as a pdf for sharing, and there is a backup/restore option. Besides typing in text, there's text-to-speech, and a sketch option.
B0087ZG7PW|5.0|Hitchcock liked to film in California. Vertigo was filmed in the Mission District of San Francisco and at the Golden Gate bridge. Shadow of a Doubt, his favorite movie, was filmed in Santa Rosa, which is north of San Francisco on highway 101. The Birds was filmed at Bodega Bay, which is west of Santa Rosa on CA highway 1, the Pacific Coast highway. If you head north on highway 1,you can drive to the Canadian border at Vancouver. Head south and you will eventually reach Santa Cruz, Big Sur, LA, San Diego and Tijuana and Ensenada in Baja California on the Sea of Cortez.<br />I put on The Birds for my cat Monkey, but she preferred to watch the real birds sitting in the olive tree in my front yard from my bay window. After watching the birds, Monkey took a nap in the cardboard shipping box from Amazon that the DVDs came in.<br />Monkey does not know that birds are what is left of the dinosaurs. If a meteorite had not crashed into the Mexican state of Yucatan millions of years ago, Monkey and I would have made a nice meal for the giant dinosaurs, who were wiped out by the meteorite.

B00498YZH8|2.0|Jennifer Lawrence great actress but story line was very depressing.  Feel like I wasted 2 hours of my life.  I would pass.
1859849296|5.0|Find out the true story about this '' SAINT&#34; and the con job she pulled. Mother Teresa Hated poor people and had a goal to keep them poor. Her biggest thing in life was collecting money for the Catholic church. She never did anything to help the poor, but rather used them as a front for her scam job.
B004XANKVO|5.0|Sorry about the Doctor Who reference.  For those of you who don't know, a Tardis is bigger on the inside than the outside.  At least that's my observation.  The backpack doesn't seem huge or obtrusive, but it has SO much space inside.<br /><br />I commute 2 hours one way each day (4 hours in total) and I've used this backpack for over a month now.  My old backpack was a High Sierra and it was stuffed with everything I carried on a daily basis.  When it finially died I looked at a lot of reviews on Amazon before choosing this Thule backpack.  I'm glad I did.<br /><br />I typically carry: my work laptop (Dell Latitude), my iPad (1st gen), my Kindle Paperwhite, Chargers, IceTrekkers (strap on ice cleats for my shoes), big winter gloves, Music books, large headphones and iPhone earbuds, several OTC medicines like tylonol and hand sanitizer, pocket knife, Wi-Fi hotspot, umbrella, large lunch bag, and a few other odds and ends.  I havn't used up half of space in this thing.  The main compartment could still easily hold shoes or a heavy hoodie and not have any problems.<br /><br />I wasn't sure about the extra &#34;stuff it&#34; pocket, but It's really useful to me.  I normally tuck my Lands End Lunch bag into it and clip it to the handle on top with a caribiner.  It's held very securely like this as opposed to carrying it or just cliping it to the top handle of my old bag where it would flop around and was very annoying.<br /><br />The pockets and compartments have several interior organization pockets, although I wish it would have a few more.  It's still quite adequate for my needs.  I find myself not using the Hard protective pocket on the outside of the bag very often, but I do keep a few things in there that I don't want damaged.  It's a nice feature for sunglasses.  I also havn't found a good use for the zipper compartment at the bottom of the pack either.<br /><br />There are complaints from some posters about the closeness of the shoulder straps, and when first putting the backpack on I was mindful of this and did notice that they seemed close.  However, after adjusting the straps to comfortably fitting me, I didn't notice this at all.  The material on the shoulder straps on the inside (part that touches you) seems to be a dry fit type of material.  The part of the backback that touches your back is also completely this material.  I'm not sure how I feel about this because It looks like it could snag on things and be damaged.  I havn't had any problems with this, I just want to be careful and pay attention to it going forword.<br /><br />Overall this backpack is great and I'm glad I spent the extra money on it.  It has a TON of space, is well built, very comfortable and makes carrying a lot of stuff on my commute very easy.tting the backpack on I was mindful of this and did notice that they seemed close.

B00BHU2A7I|5.0|Well done.  Quirky and creepy.  Makes one want to go back and watch classic Hitchcock movies again and again.  Good story behind the story.
0452295548|3.0|Hate to sound petty, but the cover was just plain white - no text, no title, nothing.  I like having the name of the book on the book. Just depends on who you buy the book from, I guess.  It didn't kill the deal, just the buzz.  :o)
B003VTZTU8|5.0|A must-read. But, well, for those that are passionate about science and medicine. If only it could be a required subject in schools!?

0307352153|2.0|I was very much looking forward to reading this book on my vacation considering all the great reviews it got here on Amazon. I kept reading and reading and waiting for it to get better and it just didn't. I found the organization of the book horrible - it didn't seem to have much organization at all and it jumped around a lot! While fairly well researched, I found a lot of the personal stories pretty useless to me. Hearing how famous people or random people deal with being an introvert does not help me. I was hoping for more of of \\"personal\\" book, how to deal with being an introvert in our society, and this just didn't seem to be that at all. I was very surprised when I got to the end how this book got such great reviews. I guess I am just an outlier!
B00B5HQL50|5.0|This is an excellent movie. One of the best yet.<br /><br />Daniel Craig is at his best in this action packed movie. You find out things about James Bond that's totally unexpected.

B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Just own Lawrence of Arabia on Bluray.  It's that simple.  If you're curious how good HD can look--own this disc.  You don't need the huge collector's edition.  Buy this one.  Impeccable picture and sound.  Even if you only watch it once a year or once in awhile this is the presentation to play and crank up.  Maximum quality on every level and priced between 15 and 20 bucks depending on where you shop or what time of year you buy.  If you're a fan of cinema buy this, and also buy the remastered edition of Patton (the one with the flag in the background on the cover photo).  Can't go wrong with bluray when there's been so much TLC put into titles such as this.
B001SAO38Q|3.0|I have been collecting English nouveau films from the sixties, and I was hoping this movie would prove itself worthy of being added to the collection.  This movie is a great disappointment.  The story line is plain and thin, and the characters in place to develop and carry the weak plot fall short.  Michael Caine, who I appreciate in so many other of his works, is unremarkable as leader of a heist.  He does not exude the qualities of authority or cleverness one would associate with a criminal mastermind.  The redeeming part of the movie is the car chase, which is more humorous than exciting, and the ending is so ridiculous that one wonders who was in charge of the disconnected screenplay.  If you are a fan of this film, then I would highly recommend this Blue-ray version, as the audio and video quality is unsurpassed...however, the movie stinks.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is very fast paces and intense as you rush and try to stay on the track and trail without falling off.
B005I4JG80|5.0|I'd recommend this book to all moms and dads. Especially if you feel unsure about how you want to bring up your child (French parents \\"educate\\" their children, they don't \\"dicipline\\" them) or if you feel like you've lost your own identity and don't have a life of your own anymore. A great book! Gave me a lot to think about. Highly recommend!
0783225970|5.0|This movie is still a classic! While it is fun to go back in time to the early 90's, this is al pacino at his finest! While it is not for everybody, many have enjoyed it & any fan of action movies will enjoy adding it to their collection, yes, this is a must own!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is the best series PBS has ever done in my lifetime.  It has such great characters and so full of history.  Very true to the times.
B00005RDRO|4.0|Ok, it was the 90's, butt it was silly & fun. Was it a classic, well no, butt it is not the worst movie of all time either. If you like any of the stars in this, you will be pleased. If you never saw it, then you are in for a treat. Just go with it & try not to over think it, it is not a suspense movie, it is a comedy!
B003TEO3EI|5.0|For me Blind Guardian is the best in power metal, speed metal, and orchestral metal. While I consider their ANATO a masterpiece and that nothing can come close to that album, ATEOT is simply amazing.<br /><br />I think that BG is a specific band--you either love it or don't care for it.<br />I am among the lovers, and i love every track on this album.<br />Sacred Worlds is fantastic, War of the Thrones is beautiful and melodic, Curse my Name reminded me of my favorite Skalds and Shadows, and Wheel of Time is an absolute 8 min masterpiece.<br /><br />Great job, BG!
B000BNX4MC|5.0|This was john hughes crown jewel. I don't think i can add anything more to what has already been said about this movie. It can be watched again & again. The bonus is that the whole family can also enjoy it do to the clever writing. If you don't own it, you should!
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|No, this is not the lighthearted Hobbit by Tolkien, this is another Hobbit who runs, and runs, and runs away from goblins, trolls, orcs, gollum, and many other baddies.<br />Constant runnign throughout the movie. Constant action. And 90% CGI.<br />I can see why the biggest Hobbit fans are disappointed, but I decided to not be so fulnerable and enjoy the movie for what it was. The Hobbit was a kid's book, the movie Hobbit is turned into an epic journey, which is not really a bad thing, but to turn it into a trilogy, you need to make it really slow and introduce new characters (the white orc, etc).<br /><br />Certainly a great entertainment, but not the Hobbit based on children's book.

B000IJ79V6|5.0|Superman The Movie and Superman 2 were originally shot together by Richard Donner. Due to differences with the producers, another director Richard Lester was called in to shoot Superman 2, despite Donner having done a large part of the sequel.<br /><br />Now available on DVD are Lester's cinematic version and the original Richard Donner cut. I am going to do a comparison of the two versions, so spoilers ahead.<br /><br />RICHARD LESTER'S THEATRICAL VERSION:<br />Approximately 75% of Lester's work and 25% of Donner's material.<br /><br />1) All footage of Marlon Brando excised because of legal reasons. So Jor-El is absent when judgement is pronounced on the three rebels.<br />2) A hydrogen bomb in Paris is thrown into space and explodes, freeing General Zod, Ursa and Non from the Phantom Zone.<br />3) There's a tour of the honeymoon suite in Niagara Falls. Lois exclaims: \\"Gee, real polyester!\\"<br />4) Lois tests Clark by jumping into the river.<br />5) There are more scenes on the three villains wreaking havoc at the small town.<br />6) Clark trips and gets his hand caught in the fire, giving his real identity away to Lois.<br />7) Superman talks to his mum about giving up his powers to be with Lois.<br />8) There's no explanation about how Superman regains his powers save for a shot of the green crystal.<br />9) There are some variations in the mid air battle between Superman and the trio as well as the civilians being blown away. Generally, there are more action sequences.<br />10) The finale has Superman doing a laser battle and high and seek with the villains.<br />11) Superman erases Lois' memory by kissing her and plants the American flag back to the White House.<br /><br />The two disc special edition features commentaries, making ofs and eight 1940s cartoons.<br /><br />RICHARD DONNER'S CUT:<br />Approximately 83% of Donner's material<br /><br />To be fair to Donner, he was taken off the project suddenly and was then asked to reconstruct the film years later.So he did not have the luxury of re shooting but rather to re assemble the film with his and Lester's footage.<br /><br />1) Lots of Marlon Brando in this one. Including the scene where he pronounced judgement on the three insurrectionists.<br />2) Two rockets were fired in the first Superman film. One of which Superman hurls into space and this breaks the Phantom Zone and frees the rebels.<br />3) Lois tests Clark by jumping out of the office window.<br />4) Luthor escapes from prison, goes to Superman's home and discover the background of the three villains using a crystal shard.<br />5) Lois fires a blank at Clark and exposes him as Superman.<br />6) Superman talks to his dad Jor-El about Lane and gives up his powers. Subsequently he gets them back as his father's spirit goes into him. The father becomes the son and vice versa. Very Biblical in a way as he mentions that the prophecy is fulfilled. This is a more satisfying explanation.<br />7) Superman destroys his home after vanquishing the villains. We only know Lex Luthor is alive in the deleted scenes - taken away by the police.<br />8) Superman reverses the globe to restore the damage and to also erase Lane's memories. You see a shot of the Phantom Zone flying backwards. Which begs the question - will Zod & Co strike again?<br /><br />I was also reminded that in Revelations, Satan will be allowed to wreck havoc on earth. The three villains could be symbolic of these events. Also there's a scene where General Zod walks on water - a reference to Jesus walking on water?<br /><br />Terence Stamp (General Zod) and Gene Hackman (Lex Luthor) both went on to play drag queens in The Adventures Of Priscilla Queen Of The Desert and The Birdcage respectively. What a scream.<br /><br />Both versions are imperfect with unanswered questions but it does not take away the fact that both films are enjoyable and entertaining. Each sold separately.
B005LAII8K|5.0|Time travel movies generally are exercises in style over substance, they aim to be pleasing and often succeed. Rian Johnson's Looper manages to be as smart as it wants to be and as entertaining as any movie I have seen this year. A smart, thriller that is not afraid to trust that it's audience is willing to think and still enjoy themselves.<br /> Starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and set in a vivid, but understated future. Gordon-Levitt plays Joe, a cynical blunderbuss carrying hitman, who assassinates individuals sent from the future so that no bodies are left in their present. Thirty years in the future, the<br />loopers are themselves sent down the line to be offed by their younger self, this is called closing the loop. As he makes clear, this job doesn't attract forward thinkers.<br /> Joe has plans to retire, learn French and live out his days in Europe. When his loop is compromised by his older self (Bruce Willis), who has come back prepared to take it on the lam. The older Joe isn't interested in just running to save his own life, he has a plan to search out the leader of a future criminal organization and kill him. This leaves Gordon-Levitt's Joe in a tight spot that he hopes to get himself out of by hiding out on a farm with a woman (Emily Blunt) and her 10 year-old son, Cid (Pierce Gagnon). Their roles in all this becomes more clear as the two Joes prepare for a final face off.<br /> A complicated plot, twisty as time travel tales often are. Happily, it all seems to come together in a bold unexpected ending. I saw the movie in a full house, when the credits come up there is no outro music and the audience was stone silent in pleasant surprise. Kudos to Johnson's excellent, well thought out and provocative script.<br /> This is Johnson's third film, following the brilliant high school neo-noir Brick, which failed to find an audience partially because of it's cold narrative and unusual structure. His second film was the slight, but slightly wonderful romantic comedy adventure the Brothers Bloom. Looper is his best movie so far, I can't wait to see what this unique and very talented filmmaker comes up with next, it will almost certainty be something fresh and original. A talent to keep an eye on for sure.<br /> In his supporting role,  top-billed Willis shows that he is still every bit an action star, but he also gets a chance to remind us that he is an underrated character actor who has anchored more than his share of tough dramatic roles over the years. This is not just his best movie in a long while, but his best role in years. He has a tricky part here, he is neither hero, nor villain, managing to be equal parts of both while maintaining audience identification. A common man action star like Gene Hackman in his day, Willis should be allotted more roles like this.<br /> Jeff Daniels is also very good, an unlikely casting choice, stealing his few scenes as a gangster and cast against type as the movie's lead villain. Gordon-Levitt and Daniels were previously in the excellent, but little seen heist thriller the Lookout. Daniels is a good actor often wasted in forgettable roles, not so here.<br /> Make no mistake though, this is Gordon-Levitt's movie, having previously starred in the director's Brick, the part was written for the young actor. A formidable presence and one of the very best actors of his age, Gordon-Levitt has been in a number of good films, giving solid performances, yet has remain relatively unknown up to this point. Under some impressive make-up to resemble a young version of Willis, this should be the film that makes stardom no longer aloof for the talented young actor.<br /> Dealing with themes of regret and repentance, as well as moral affecting choices things such as predication versus free will. Johnson has written an existentially moody script, it's not a heavy handed or pretentious one and should appeal to those who have enjoyed the best work of Christopher Nolan, in the past. The plot twists are well handled and followed through to their inevitable conclusions. The movie that Looper most makes me think of is Le Jette and it's English language remake, the Bruce Willis starrer 12 Monkeys. Looper is as smart as people think Inception is and as smart as Minority Report wanted to be.<br /><br />see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.comll handled and followed through to their inevitable conclusions.

B007X4ECLY|3.0|The question that Lockout raises that requires the most pondering from a savvy viewer is, can a single performance be so unexpected, offbeat and exuberant as to make a bad movie good. Well, not good I suppose, but it can make a humdrum experience more entertaining, interesting, and outright fun. That is precisely what Guy Pearce does for the generic genre exercise Lockout.<br /><br />Playing Snow, no first name given, unless it is also Snow.  A former CIA operative, turned outlaw, framed for a crime he didn't commit. Snow is given a choice, spend thirty years cryogenically frozen in prison or go in alone to a penal colony orbiting in space to rescue the US President's daughter (Maggie Grace from Taken), who is caught up as a hostage in a prison riot.<br /><br />If this sounds familiar it's because Lockout, the latest potboiler from the bane of the French critics existence Luc Besson, shamelessly  rips off John Carpenter's films Escape From New York, Escape From L.A. and to a lesser degree Assault on Prescient 13. Even a once speculated third installment to be titled \\"Escape From Earth\\". However, budgetary restrictions and a recycled script of derivative characters and cliché dialogue makes this come across more like a Roger Corman knock off of Carpenter, which the right audience will find appealing.<br /><br />The only thing that really allows Lockout to stand out, to rise above it's middling limitations is it's star performance from Guy Pearce. A long under used leading man, here Pearce shines in a character clearly patterned after Kurt Russell's \\"Snake\\" Plisskan, \\"Snake\\"  still is a cooler name than Snow. Pearce brings a sense of wit, sarcasm and a lazy anti-hero streak that would make Bogie look like Sly Stallone.<br /><br />Going full on commando as the chain smoking, wise cracking rebel hero, Pearce is hard not to like here. He is such a good casting choice, because he is so unexpected in the role, where a Jason Statham or Gerard Butler would have seemed as tired as the material. This is an old school sci-fi actioner, we've seen it all before, it's exhaustedly plagiaristic, but at a well paced 96 minutes and with such an amicable star performance, some how this keeps from showing all it's obvious cracks.<br /><br />Lacking the artificial \\"depth\\" of so many of Besson's recent out put, this picture works as pure unflinching fluff. Sometimes that is just what an audience wants, even I have fallen victim to such primitive desires, but here Pearce adds the spark to the ignition that turns this puppy over to something a little more resembling a quality picture.<br /><br />see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com

B006QVRUS2|4.0|It all started with a school yard quarrel between their eleven year-old sons. Penelope and Michael are the parents of the victim, as they call it, and Alan and  Nancy are those of the \\"criminal\\", which is also how they put it. They gather at Michael and Penelope's upper-middleclass apartment to discuss a resolution and perhaps warranted discipline, but this isn't really about the kids, the crime, the victim or the criminal. It is about their parents and how civility is just a façade awaiting to be unmasked, or the god of carnage being unleashed.<br /> Roman Polanski's movie Carnage isn't much more than one long, fascinating discussion that turns into a fight and then a battle of wills as perpetrated by four fine actors, giving four wonderful performances.<br /> Those actors are Christoph Waltz and Kate Winslet as Alan and Nancy Cowan and Jodie Foster and John C. Reilly as Penelope and Michael Longstreet. They are all pitch perfect in these roles, they are also immensely watchable actors, being the whole show isn't a hamper on the surroundings as much as it's a blessing having everything else get out of way of these superb performers.<br /> Also there is a first rate screenplay provided by Yasmina Reza, based on  her play \\"God of Carnage\\".  Filled with clever and wonderfully witty dialogue, smart retorts and an endless  barrage of one up manships that could happily resonate on the lips of the Monty Python troupe or a more modern Marx Brothers.<br /> Polanski, one of the truly great filmmaker's still operating today, seems to have had a major reassurance of ability in the last decade or so, whenever the Pianist came out and just after the Ninth Gate. Polanski resists doing much with the surrounding are here, he never once attempts to \\"open up\\" the staginess in Carnage, this show belongs to his talent cast and anything that could stand in there way has been alimented. So why essentially film a play, well so a lot of people like me can experience Foster, Waltz, Winsletand Reilly wonderful  in these roles.<br /> Given the subject matter and the claustrophobic environment Carnage wisely doesn't stick around longer than it should, at only 79 minutes including credits, it doesn't get a change to wear out it's welcome. A minor movie in the oeuvre of Polanski's perhaps, but one that is well worth watching.<br /><br />see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com
0143034545|5.0|This book is an excellent companion to David Allen's other books. It explains the concepts in a highly readable manner.
B009369Z8A|4.0|Australian John Hillcoat is without a doubt one of the most fascinating filmmakers working today, an heir to a style of filmmaking that not only seems dead now, but long so. His movies are beauties to behold, they are character driven, action filed and deal with themes of displaced men and time. His new movie, Lawless, is no exception, to say it fails to reach the same heights as his two previous pictures is not a criticism so much as an observation, it's not as powerful as the highly regarded stark western the Proposition nor is it as deeply moving as his underrated adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's the Road. With a recent output like that, it would be tough to continue or equal it, yet Lawless is still a sensational motion picture, not just one of the year's very best, but a strong identifiable work that will be appreciated for a long time to come.<br /> Working from a screenplay by musician Nick Cave, who also wrote the excellent script for the Proposition, adapted from the fact based book by Matt Bondurant (grandson of one of the film's actual protagonists) the Wettest County in the World, Hillcoat's original movie title. Set in rural America of the prohibition era, Lawless tells what Cave calls \\"a true myth\\" about the Bondurant brothers, outlaw heroes of the Virginia hill country, moonshiners who not only defy the law, but as legend has it are invincible because of the many perils that they have overcome and survived that would kill lesser men. None more audacious than middle brother, Forrest (Tom Hardy), who is either blessed or actually is  immortal, his survival skill is something to consider.<br /> When a big city special agent, Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce) comes into Franklin county, not so much to put a stop to the brothers illegal activities, but looking for part of the take. Hostilities between the Bondurants and the law escalates to also include big city gangsters like Floyd Bonner (Gary Oldman). The conflict eventually grows into outright warfare betweenthe lot of them.<br /> Things aren't all bloodshed and death, as youngest brother Jack (Shia LeBouf), while trying to prove himself as a worthy heir to the family legacy, also finds himself courting a local preacher's daughter, Bertha (Mia Wasikowska). But the real love story develops between Forrest and Maggie Beauoral (Jessica Chastin), a city girl, who comes to Franklin county looking to outrun a past best left forgotten. The two wounded souls with hard exteriors are able to unleash their inner tenderness together.<br /> Hillcoat has returned macho cinema to a glorious unflinching place from it's celebrated bloodstained past. His best work recalls the films of maverick hard men directors like Sam Peckinpah, Sam Fuller, Raoul Walsh, and other ambitious auteurs often with a reputation for the lurid, perhaps never more so than with Lawless. Combining elements of the urban gangster film and the western outlaw hero stories, pooled before with mixed results in pictures such as Walter Hill's Last Man Standing and the superior Sam Elliott telefilm You Know My Name, here with greater results. Everything at this juncture is a work of masterful film art, great production and attention to period details, sharp camera work (by Benoit Delhomme), taunt editing, a memorable score and first rate performances.<br /> Impeccably told in a style that gives a real sense of time and place. We gain a real feel for the people and the locations. This is the kind of movie that you can smell in your mind, from the unkempt Bonderants to the more dandy Rakes.<br /> LeBouf is reasonably good in the role of Jack, playing a timid, semi-weak young man transformed into a cocky, arrogant hothead. LeBouf is an alright actor who sometimes gets undue flack, however, he lacks the real strength to fully carry a film like this, he's a little too blasé to be a good leading man. That's why we have Tom Hardy, who with his portrayal of Forrest Bondurant, fully comes into his own as a movie star, this is theone that should transfix him into a household name. Hardy dominates every scene he is in, he walks away with the movie after kicking it in the teeth and leaving it bludgeoned over the head.<br /> The supporting cast is just as superb, in fact Lawless couldn't be all that it is without the small, but crucial work done by Jessica Chastain, who is not only one of the most exciting presences on film today, but seems to be as impervious to bad film roles as the Bondurants are to bereavement. Guy Pearce, who has appeared in Hillcoat's two previous masterworks, is ferocious and unrelenting as the essentially strong antagonist, it`s remarkably to think of all the many different type of roles we`ve seen Pearce do in the recent past. Mia Wasikowska with her ethereal beauty and infectious smile adds a perfect counter balance to the testosterone fueled antics on screen. Gary Oldman is always a welcome presence, even if it is just a cameo as it is here, but he looks cool and snazzy with a tommy gun.<br /> The score by Cave and Warren Ellis is something of genius unto it's elf. Cave, providing new music with a special one off band, cheekily called the Bootleggers, as well as incorporating tunes beautiful sung by Emmylou Harris, the soundtrack not only assists the movie, but helps to more fully tell it's story. Cave and his bootleggers give a thrilling rendition of Lou Reed's Velvet Underground classic \\"White Light, White Heat\\", match by a winning bluegrass interruption by Ralph Stanley played over the picture's closing credits. The supplementary CD release of the soundtrack album is via Sony Classical, proving that even the label recognizes the artistry in the accompanying music.<br /> Lawless is a rip roaring thrilling adventure. A gun totting, gin soaked action drama. It's all that, with the kick of a mule captured in a bottle of pure grain white lightning and white heat.<br /><br />see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com

B004WR125O|5.0|I bought this to go along with the [[ASIN:B004UR486G Onkyo TX-8050 Network Stereo Receiver (Black)]]and it has been working great for over a year now. Signal strength is not an issue for me, but occasionally it does seem take a minute to connect to my WiFi. Once everything was set up and running I immediately started enjoying my digital music collection and it never sounded better. I have a pair of [[ASIN:B0018QRO9A Polk Audio TSi200 Bookshelf Speakers (Pair, Black)]] and a Polk powered sub and this set up works fine for my needs. Pandora and other online services sound great, plus you can access a seemingly endless supply of streaming audio from all over the world which I think is pretty cool. I agree that this adapter should be included with the receiver and not be an add on item, but in the end it is worth the money if you want to use the internet features without connecting another cable. Just buy it.

B00AN0KGWE|4.0|Entertains, sometimes confusing, but excellent fantasy series. Gratuitous sex is the rule, so parents be advised. Worth viewing in HD.

B009K0P10K|4.0|I loved the original plot of the show, however with the involvement of 'The Intiative', it has gotten a little off base.
B00005JNJV|5.0|The beginning of the great Dark Knight trilogy. This movie is amazing especially Ra's Al Ghul as Liam Neeson his acting was spectacular and Christian Bale is the BATMAN. The only thing I don't like is that Rachael gets changed as a different actress the next movie. =l what a bummer
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|can't wait for season 4. I want to see how it all ends up. this show keeps you wnating to see more.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|It is a typical Bond movie.  At times, the dialogue was difficult to hear.  At least, with a rental, we could pause and replay to catch the words.  I did not think that the HD quality was very good.

0762434279|1.0|If you are looking for a full size book, this is not one.  Measures about two inches by two inches and should have cost thirty nine cents,
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Awesome futuristic sci-fi action flick. What else can I say. If you like that sort of thing, you'll love this movie.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I LOVE this author. This book was excellent. If you like scary books, I am sure you will enjoy this one.<br />After reading this I had to purchase her other books and found that each one was impossible to put down. I'm passing<br />the word to my family and friends.
B00A6D5GBE|3.0|Good kids game for wasting time.  Pretty simple but entertaining.  Just moving objects around to allow the sleepwalker to progress to his goal without bumping into stuff while collecting moons.  He moves pretty much in a straight line at a set speed.

B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Felt true. Was well acted, especially by Denzel as usual. Thrilling moments of flying at the first. Worth a watch. I may watch again sometime.
B0001CNRB6|5.0|Rock Hudson and Doris Day do it again in this great film. Edie Adams provides nice support.  Rock and Doris were the top team in the early 1960's. I was lucky to see this in the theatre.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Great action although I did miss the usual gadgets 007 is equipped with.  It was nice to see the Austin Martin once again.
B00007GZR0|5.0|Rock Hudson and Doris Day are superb in this fine comedy. Great support is given by Paul Lynde.  Rock and Doris were the most popular film team of the early 1960's. I was lucky to see this in the theatre.
B004SDEP38|1.0|The reason I gave this trial a whirl was so I could edit documents.  But I can't!  I have to &#34;upgrade&#34; to do it!  It's a TRIAL.  I'm supposed to be able to TRY it out.  I will not be purchasing this ridiculous item &#34;for real&#34; whenever the &#34;trial&#34; is up.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The nuances of the story are intriguing. There was a lull during the second third of the book. I suspected the ending all along but it was still great to be validated.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|To be honest, I think if you are going to read this book, just skim the beginning and part of the middle and then read the rest of it. Because it is droning on about useless things for a half of the book! Take my advice!!!
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|I like the fact that the film is free from any harmful scenes i.e. nudism, sexuality, etc. I can let my 3 yo son watch it with no worries.
034580404X|2.0|Since everybody was talking about the book I choose to get it myself....I only kept on reading because I was \\"curious\\" what happens next - due to the fairly unrealistic episodes of things happening one after another....just like add on like to keep the thread going somehow. Realistic....I really wonder.<br />Worst was the helicopter crash and poor Christian was not even able to contact home - supposedly he forgot!!! That is not a match for his character and the first thing that would come to everybody's mind when you are in a tough situation! But he forgot....a poor attempt and very disappointing when he showed up at his apt....I was totally disappointed how poor this scene ends. Way to unrealistic!<br />What I stumbled across very quickly the cheap, teenager like language, repetitive and odd....\\"Holly crap\\" and \\"Jeez\\"....non stop. Are there any other words to express yourself as a good writer? This does not sound like a good writer.<br />The sexual episodes pushed in everywhere and I wonder how many really have sex every hour or so....and it is very repetitive again in words and style - nothing to get exited about to read....by the second book I just fluently went through the scenes without reading in detail...so boring.<br />So, this book has been so overrated and I suspect too many teenagers have read it and praised it with poor judgement and just reading about sex they should not know about at their age. That made them so exited about it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It really seemed to drag, but once I start a book I hate to not finish it.  I am so glad I did, because it did get a lot better towards the end, and the end was a big surprise.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Michael Connelly is a new author to me but I am enjoying every one of his books that I have read.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|The game is great! There are sooooooooooooooo many choices on what to do with my horse! I wouldn't change a thing.
B000PMLFRA|3.0|I prefer the original version. I REALLY dislike all the little add ons like that corny quasi jazz performance at that bar.  And I miss the accidental puppet hand showing in Hoth. I wish someone would've said that it wasn't the original but ah well.
0060531053|5.0|I love this book!  Don't worry!  If you're a first time brewer like myself and have no clue about what you're doing, this is a good place to start your education.  Well written and laced with humor.  The steps are easy to follow and rationale for doing things the way he recommends is pretty sound.  I also like how he takes you from &#34;beginner&#34; to &#34;intermediate&#34; to &#34;advanced' techniques and not failing to explain the settle differences and provide required equipment lists.  Towards the back he also offers recipes for making mead and a couple of home brew recipes that he enjoys.  Packed with information, easy and fun to read. I would recommend this book to anyone who is considering home brewing for the first time.
0060254920|1.0|I am grateful I wasn't exposed to this as a kid. I can't think of any stories that I despise more than this one. I recall the characters, with the exception of the mother, being violent and mean. My interpretation of Max is that of an angry, disrespectful, and grossly wild child who constantly, intentionally goes against the rules. The behavior and personality of all the characters are extreme in a very unhealthy manner. It's exceptionally weird and unsettling. The resolution of the story has Max returning home but he didn't seem to have learned anything. If I were able to give less than zero stars I would. I absolutely agree with other reviewers who encourage people to borrow this book from the library first. Better to get it knowing you like it, then to get it and potentially be sorely disappointed.
B00BLGZDVS|2.0|Is it just me, or whenever Joaquin Phoenix overacts do you have a hard time taking it seriously?  This movie seems to be basically an excuse to watch him chew the scenery, with no real motivation.  His characters relationship with the &#34;Master&#34; can be interesting in some scenes, but simply isn't enough to carry this movie.  Camera angeles, lighting, and the score are all in line to tell you that this is an artsy, intellectual film; if it were actually that artsy and intellectual it might be worth watching.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Exciting and adventurous, this was better than the first. It had more movement and we learned a lot about the world of caster's and Ethan's family ties to them. Can't wait to start the third installment!
B003KJF2WE|3.0|My kid is superhero obsessed and requested this. I ended up watching it as he ran around the house instead. I'd forgotten how much fun a simple action flick could be on a Saturday afternoon when it's too cold to go outside.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Patricia Cornwell is a wonderful author and her books are well worth reading and I will continue reading her novels.
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|Oliver Stone doesn't disappoint in this action flick!  In the great tradition of other violent drug gang style movies, Savages delivers a one-two knockout punch.  The directing is great and the acting is top notch.

B0084U0IEG|5.0|I could not put this book down. It was sexy and smart and puzzling.  I loved the vocabulary and the setting.
B00A85EMVK|4.0|I understand that digital was not an option when this was filmed but there is a large amount of grainy low-quality background on this film. It did not appear to be a very good analog to digital conversion.<br />The 3D effects were nice. They were about what you would expect from a conversion of this type. The jets stood out from the sky and dog fights were clearly worked on as a priority. There were a couple parts where some ghosting occurred along wings and at the top and bottom of the screen. I don't know if this was a 3D conversion artifact or an analog to digital conversion problem.<br />Anyway, if you have a 3D television and don't yet have a DVD or BluRay of this movie, this is a good time to get in on it.
1423124111|5.0|I can't believe it took them so long to put this together. Virtually EVERY attraction poster, including gorgeous side-by-side comparisons of various prints that really capture the art of old-fashioned screen printing. The 1950s and 1960s posters are absolute classics.

Dark, sad and a bit hard to watch in parts, but they did a good job with the &#34;handheld&#34; camera style without giving you motion sickness. Not the kind of movie I'd want to watch again right after finishing it, but I'd definitely put it in the &#34;must watch at least once&#34; column.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I LOVE this game!  I love the colors!  I love the different levels I just wish there were more than three.  It's a great way to pass the time and a great game to play just for the fun of it.  Highly recommend it!
B0013FSL0C|4.0|I was a practicing therapist for twenty years. This series would be very useful and informative for those who wonder what therapy is all about and how it works. It comes across to me as a genuine depiction of the therapeutic process.<br />That being said, I feel the need to comment on the roles of therapist as played by Paul, and the role of supervisor as depicted in Gina.<br />I think Paul is a good therapist, and that is saying something in this field that is populated by many who haven't a clue about how to do this work. He is very empathic - that is, he demonstrates an ability to understand the feelings of his patients. He is respectful always with patients who are difficult. However, he is totally unwilling to share himself and his history with patients who would benefit from it. This is a matter of judgement, but Paul is bound by the dogmatic and rigid rules of this profession, which are formulated and promulgated in order to insure that no patient is adversely affected by therapists who don't know how to do the work. Paul frequently answers a legitimate question with another question, which properly infuriates his patients, and which allows Paul to dodge the question. He is frequently too emphatic in his making of points, which scares his patients into non-responsive submission. He shouts when he could just talk. He is at times unprofessional, appearing in his sessions unshaven and wearing jeans.<br />Gina, as his &#34;supervisor&#34; comes across as all-knowing, patronizing, judgmental, controlling, and frequently off the mark in thinking about and reacting to Paul's problems.She is the epitome of the social worker therapist. She is a walking cliche, complete with dresses that cover her from neck to floor, the sappy, pasted-on smile, the fake &#34;little girl&#34; way she speaks, and her insipid manner. Faultlessly acted by this actor<br />Still, a very good view of the profession.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am not one for watching much TV expecially soap opera type shows, but I absolutely love this show and I can't wait until the new season starts!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|A terrific movie! I wanted to see if it was better than my favorite from last year, Flight, and it was. I kept saying to my girlfriend, that even though I knew how it would end, it was still very suspenseful and full of drama and tension. Knowing that it was based on real events just made it better.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|As an ex Philadelphian, Quick's use of local sites made the book interesting to me as an ex city boy.  The story of someone's fight to over come mental illness is well told.
B002OMZTSU|5.0|I never miss the Late Late Show. Craig Ferguson is flat-out brilliant, and watching his improvs with Josh Robert Thompson, who does the voice of Geoff, his \\"gay robot sidekick\\", is an example every night of two great comedic minds riffing off each other, and it's thrilling. With this book, though, Ferguson demonstrates that he is as good a writer as he is a comic. He has a wonderful voice when he writes, and some of his turns of phrase are sheer poetry. On top of that, he has a wonderful story to tell of how he went through alcohol and drugs and other self-destructive behavior, but survived and came out the other side a much better man. Get this book and read it. You won't be disappointed.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|This storyline dipicts an alien invastion, which uses the oceans as its tactical choise for its technology.  It then begins the march of invasion and conquest, without reason or moral.
B00992CF6W|5.0|mine craft is a game to survive and collect item's and destroy creepers and skeletons and spiders also zombies.You could also make huge creations.
B000SGSU58|5.0|kept me guessing the whole time. so many twists and turns. great plot, great characters, and just a fun read.
B004WGIXX4|4.0|Good solid romantic comedy. Predictable, but most of them are. The characters were warm, funny and engaging. If your looking for a relaxing movie without any drama or anxiety, this is it.
B003X27L9U|4.0|This book really illustrated the filtering, sorting and categorising that a child must do in order to make sense of his environment and the people around him. It shows how loyal a child can be and how dependent they are on their environment and how secure they feel in a routine. It was a wonderful read and I would highly recommend it. Seeing the world through the eyes of a child, whatever that world may be was very interesting and enlightening.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This show is absolutely wonderful and addicting to watch.  You fall in love with the characters and the plot is utterly compelling.  The costume and set design is very detail oriented and gorgeous.  I've already watched this season twice and I find new things every time.  It also follows the books (which are even more amazing) quite well.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Love this game. I have no problems with this game. It is a little challenge for my kids but they love it also.
B0018O4YSQ|5.0|A great creepy Sci-Fi where the blu-ray version enhance the special effects.  If a film that can be easily watched multiple times just to watch the effects.
159420411X|2.0|Book was ok but did not live up to the hype. Found it one to be one of those over hyped \\"young turks\\" turning the business world upside down. The reality is a lot of this has already been said.
B007T99ENE|2.0|Why did I rate this a 2?  As an established author, I think he did a very lousy job try to write as a woman...McEwan has badly interpreted how a woman would think and write..in this book he is pretending to write the woman's memoirs ....which in turn becomes a man memoirs then turn back into a woman's.....it's just badly written...I think it's his own memoirs written trying to be sold and made into a movie...
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I down loaded because all my girlfriends were reading and recommended; forgot to tell me how filthy it was.  did I keep reading? Yes, and I feel/felt very guilty and dirty for doing so.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|This book is well researched and paints an interesting picture of two men, on opposite sides of the war, who have much more in common that you would think.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|Should be listed as Porno; I felt very guilty reading such trash and kept skipping through thinking I would find a story
B007G5GYHA|5.0|This is a good spin-off of Shrek's Puss character.  Of course a lot of the credit goes to Antonio Banderas.  This cat is really funny, naughty, and has a good heart.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Cannot comment, have not read. Down loaded and perhaps should not have. After reading first one had to take a look at what I want to read: The Bible or Porno
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Very nice horse game. I would recommend to anyone, promotes working a job through, patience to wait for strength to return, and pride in a task and competition completed.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Only use it to look at pictures of my great granddaughter; rest is little I care about or want to write about
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One of the best shows to ever hit the airways. Keeps you on the edge of your seat !!! Finally something I can watch after the end of the X Files !!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Have not used yet, but will always keep on my Kindle.  Should be everyone's first reading of the day. Easy to read
1616550414|5.0|Unfortunately, I was the second one to give her this same product. But nonetheless she loves it and felt this was an extremely thoughtful present considering the fact that I know little to nothing about Zelda. She agrees that this is The Holy Book for all Zelda fans.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved the book, but got a bit boring in the last part. As a Nicolas Sparks fan forever, a bit disappointed. Looking forward to seeing the movie
B0084U0IEG|3.0|I am a die-hard Ian McEwan fan and have read all of his books.  This one just was not up to snuff.  It was more of a romance novel than a dark, creative intrigue as his other novels are.  A real shame!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Addictive; use so much while traveling.  My husband thinks I am so smart, winning all the time, not knowing how much help I get!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I read this book in two days. I really could not put it down. The ending was a very unexpected twist of events!
B00BESLHEA|4.0|If your a Quentin Terantino fan, this one does not dissapoint. Over played, almost comical fight sequences with characters displaying super-human kung-fu abilities. Overly exagerated gore, with kind of a combination of Enter the Dragon and Street Fighter feel. This movie doen't jump around the timeline like Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs so it is easier to follow the plot all the way through the film. Grab a bag of popcorn and enjoy!
B0045HCJQW|5.0|Great old comedy staring some oldies but goodies.  This is a remake of High Society which is also great and stars Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Celeste Holmes and Grace Kelly.  Almost identical script too but a few slight differences but both casts are awesome in their own way.  You will love the fashions of the day.  I can see a lot of those vintage styles making their way back in todays stores.  Grace Kelly is so glamorous in HS and Cary Grant is so smugly witty in PS..........grab them both.....the movies that is.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Great details to the time, and the tension reached its peak toward the end. Kudos to Ben and the team for their efforts put in the movie .
B00005JKGK|5.0|Every mother and daughter should see this movie, with a big box of tissues.  Never can decide which woman I relate to most.
B0090X4GJE|5.0|If you liked the first cd your going to love the second one its a really Different sound then her first album but not less amazing.
B0099Y2MYK|3.0|...But the series is starting to go downhill.  In part because several cast members apparently wanted out of the show.  Too bad.
B007FY9ZWI|1.0|Purchased hoping to be able to transfer my extensive list of thousands of songs on my pc's Windows Media Player to my Kindle Fire.  99% of the music was incompatible.  100% of the music was loaded into WMP direct from personally purchased CD's.  Having a very close personal friend who is a professional musician, I do not download pirated music files.
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|What more can I say except this is another great film adaptation from one of our greatest romance novelists.  It's as good or even better than The Notebook.  A great date night movie!
B000N3AWDE|4.0|I thought the songs were so melodic and her voice is great in French, (her native language).<br />I would recommend it.
B004UIOUHC|5.0|I've been a fan of Opera ever since version 3.0, and this mobile version is a fine addition to Opera's products. Especially nice is that I can sync all my bookmarks with my desktop browser. It's also faster and easier to use than the stock Android browser.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|For some reason I found this not quite as exciting as past books.  It was however a good snowstorm read.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a really useful app for monitoring battery usage and it looks good too. As a free app you can't go wrong by getting this - highly recommended.
B009GQ57ES|4.0|I really enjoy this album. Local Seattle boy making it happen & doing it right. He loves his city & his city loves him!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I think this is a very good dictionary. Whenever I need to look up a word, I always use this dictionary. I think the next edition should have the names of celebrities.
0425263916|4.0|I loved Gideon the Dominant.............. I stayed up until 4:00 a.m. reading this book.  I hope book #3 Entwined is better than the last book of Fifty Shades &#34;Freed&#34;............
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! I thought I would hate it but surprisingly I can't get enough of it. It's very addictive and it's helping me get through this graveyard shift. =)
B008ZOHCKE|3.0|kind of cumbersome but, it would be much more useful useful if it uses a pen and recolonized the written words
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This has to be the best book I have read in a very long time.  I have already recommended it to my friends.  It was not a subject I had thought a lot about and you really end up feeling what it is like to have your life altered so dramatically.  It was funny,sad and insightful. Recommend for someone who wants to read a book with substance.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|We are all possible vicitms of genetic disorders....including alcohlolism, which, this movie prooves, does not exclude the fact that you may be awesome in other areas, but, this has to be taken care of for your life, and the lives of those you love to be :&#34;lived&#34;.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This story had me hooked from the first page.  It shows that even flawed or damaged people can have love,redemption and forgiveness.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|From the very first page to the end, this book is full of surprise after surprise.  I couldn't put it down.  A must read even if you are not ready.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is eazy,but there is some probelms not big problems. It is mainly picture problems with the dog  and the policeman. I think the game needs something different like turns or detours but anyways it is awesome game.
1616550414|5.0|The book is wonderfully printed, with gorgeous ilustrations and text.<br />The contents are awesome, and it also includes the Skyward Sword manga.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Should have not deviated from the book. The story did not need to be improved and the screen writers were not up to the task.<br />It still rated three stars.
B009TZBEKW|5.0|I had no idea of what album I was buying when I got it- but little did I know that half of the songson it were song I knew and enjoyed. Great buy!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was expecting another girl meets boy.. Boy has a weird past.. Girl saves boy... And it ended up the whole opposite!! It has suspense and mystery and you don't find that, that often nowadays in romance books.. That's why I loved this book. It has some serious content but it was developed in an innocent and lovely way. This is my very favorite book in the whole wide world!
B000ICXQXS|5.0|This is one of the all time great films.  The acting, the story, the plot and<br />the filming.  One of the fifty all time best.
0142000655|5.0|Gave as a gift to our 3 teenage grandsons.  A novel by a Master!  Packed with moral, ethical, real life actions and how what choice you make can and does effect your life!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|This Tom Clancy book reminds me of his early books. The scenario is right out of today's headlines.  It starts a little slow but quickly picks up the tempo.
