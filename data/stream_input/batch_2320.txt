B008JGSM6G|4.0|Flow free is an awesome game! It is challenging yet fun at the same time. Flow is one of the best puzzle games I've played. It is an arcade style game, no storyline. It can get boring at times if you play consecutively for a while. Bottom line, I would say this game isn't for everyone but I would recommend it. This game makes a 4 out of 5 on the apper scale.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|A romance with plot and twists and complications. i liked the way I was able to make connections with the characters and feel their pain somewhat...
B001N1DPDE|5.0|first off the sheath sucks, that is the only thing the company got wrong. but with a little thinking and a few trips to the hardware store, it works fine and is not a pain in the !@#.. if you are looking for a lightweight compact knife that looks amazing, this aint it..If you want knife that can be used and abused,i.e hammer,pry bar,wood cutter,cut carrots and meat for dinner, or anything around the camp site this pig is your knife.. if this knife isnt big enough for what your doing then you have other problems.. this knife is big and heavy but it wont fail you or break easy.. once you get use to handling this knife you can do even the smallest jobs
B003MC5N28|5.0|Great book- if you love books like Twilight and The Hunger Games you'll like it. After you read The giver- read the sequels- Gathering Blue, The Messenger, and The Son...
B006VFLIYK|5.0|It's terrific.  Classic Baldacci. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. I loved the book and highly recommend it.
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|I had read the book.  The Movie is as close as it gets to the book.  Very few movies actually manage to do it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|In the new &#34;Do What You Gotta Do&#34; world of the Walking Dead, they do it well!! Can't wait for Season 4.
B00BF11UM0|5.0|What seems to be a common theme among reviews is the inability to distinguish the fact that this movie is exactly that, a movie.  This is a flick &#34;based on real events&#34;, but it is a spy &#34;thriller&#34;, nothing else.  It doesn't try to be a documentary, contrary to others opinions.  What I do like it the fact that it focuses on &#34;how the sausage is made&#34;, versus direct action military flicks that seem to be dominating the silver screen lately.  You might even say it's more cerebral.  I just watched it for the second time this week, like it even more now.
B005DOL0R0|3.0|It serves it's purpose but was hoping it had a holder for the device inside and unzipped around three sides instead of two.  I would have also liked it better if it were a hard cover instead of soft.
B000AMJC2K|4.0|Typing this review on my 24&#34; ASUS monitor held by this Neo-Flex.  As always, Ergotron delivers with excellent design and materials.  Simple to install and attractive to look at.  Cable mgt could be better, hence the 4-stars, but otherwise, top notch.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This is really worth the price.  The color was great as well and the fit is perfect for the Fire HD 7 inch.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|We watch it every year and laugh at the same things and repeat the same lines over and over.  This one and the very first one are the best!
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|I've seen better, I've seen worse. This movie didn't appeal to me, but I should have expected as much based on the film rating. It bordered between PG-13 and PG, so I guess 33 is too mature for this flick.
B003F3PMYI|5.0|Excellent book.  More people would be a lot happier if they took some of this information to heart!  I reccomend this book to everyone I care about.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Yes, it's a little like a soap opera, but it's classy and beautiful. I'm happy to see O'Brien becoming multi-dimensional!
B008YU0AOE|2.0|The calculator part is nice, but my trigonometric equations didn't come out the same as my other classmates. It is off by a good enough about that I got over half of the problems wrong. That sucks!!
0307352153|4.0|This book is very informative.  I give it 4 stars at best because the print is soo small for my elderly eyes.
0553801473|3.0|..is the unfortunate question you'll be asking yourself by halfway through Martin's latest Song of Ice and Fire tome.  Where as the first three book focused largely on the conflict between two families, the Lannisters and the Starks; and Feast for Crows was essentially the exhale from that bloody war, A Dance with Dragons really has no clue where it wants to go.<br /><br />The primary settings for this edition are Meereen and The Wall (and to a lesser extent the Northern continent), neither of which offer much story progression.  These are two polar opposite wastelands in more ways than one.  One a dessert ridden with poverty, disease, and slavery.  The other an icy lifeless tundra, inhabited by outlaws sentenced to a life of servitude, and Wildlings.  One has dragons, the other an otherworldly creatures known simply as \\"The Others.\\"<br /><br />These supernatural creatures never show up, and despite their parallel qualities, these locations don't hold much relevance to one another.  The result is zero story progression on both a micro and macro level.  Both Daenarys and Stannis want to claim the throne, but neither of them make any physical or strategic progress towards acquiring it.  Its location, King's Landing, is almost omitted from the entire plot.<br /><br />Essentially the book gets taken over by side characters and sub plots.  After reading it, its clear that Martin is having trouble seeing the forest for the trees.  He's laid out a myriad of supernatural elements and intriguing story beats: Wights, Giants, Melisendre's dark magic, tribes of undead fire worshippers, Daenary's politically precarious position, the Dragons, Stannis' relentless pursuit of power, the uprising of the church in King's Landing, Arya's fantasy of getting bloody revenge---it is as unclear as ever as to how all these elements will convene into one story.  Martin has called SoIaF unfilmable.  He may have ended up with a story that's unwritable.
B0074EIQUG|5.0|I listen to everything Dr. John has released but I hadn't seen this one,  I am very excited to listen to it.  Excellent transaction in all ways.
B005ISQ7JM|5.0|A great little essay. The perfect blend of forest and trees. The emphasis on html 5  as connection maker was very clear and thought provoking.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|When this series started had wanted to watch it but did not. That was a big mistake, plan to watch all the other seasons just hope it does not end any time soon.
B008C20TDG|5.0|Dallas and Melissa do such a great job of describing why we should avoid certain foods and provide real life examples that so many people can relate to.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I was a big Stephen King fan.  I read quite a bit (but not all) of his earlier stuff but got disillusioned ten years ago and stopped. I picked up &#34;Under the Dome&#34; and now &#34;11/22/63&#34; and really enjoyed them. 11/22/63 is a great read particularly for us boomers that remember where we were when we heard about JFK.  The story is engaging, reminiscent of &#34;The Stand&#34; for me.  Great detail but its delivered in a way that doesn't become tedious. There are a lot of time travel stories out there but King adds some twists that give you more to think about besides the obvious paradoxes that are so prevalent.  Stephen I'm back, gonna look for the next read.
B00164CM46|5.0|This is one of those hidden gems.  It has been around and few people have given it much attention at all.  What is interesting about this movie is that Brad Pitt is not the top guy, it's a Brit flick with a lot of names many of us have never heard.  Nevertheless, it is witty and the ending always gets me laughing.  This belongs in everybody's collection.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Don't know if it will go down in history as great television, but it diffentially has its  hooks in me.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|So, I had had good luck with the 20-song CD that arrived at my door two days before the targeted release date.  Expected the same thing for the DVD/BD.  It came a week after it was in Wal-Mart and Wal-Mart had a special deal for six dollars less and it included the 20-song CD.  Amazon remains my go-to-source for older movies, and I think I will stick with Wal-Mart or Target for the new releases.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I watched some of the episodes before, but it was nice to watch in order. One always picks up hints and clues the second time around. Hated the ending though, was a real shock to say the least.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|All of my grandchildren love this movie as do their parents and grandparents.  We can't wait for the second one to come out!
159562015X|4.0|The book is pocket size, and you must use the interactive component to really get the full value from the exercise. Once you take the online quiz, (takes about 30-40 uninterrupted minutes) you get an almost instant analysis. This is available in PDF.<br /><br />Interesting to focus on strengths and how they're analyzed. It's helped me flesh out my CV, and given me insights into my thought processes. If you're doing a career evaluation, or just curious, give it a read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love the book .I was happy that katniss marry peeta . When I was reading the book I had a feeling that she was in love with peeta. I was right about th hat
B002PMV9FG|5.0|My whole family loves the entire Harry Potter series.  The DVD was new and arrived right on time hassle free!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Will definitely read again in the future. I am telling everyone they should read this series immediately.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|i like all of the angry birds games i did not do space or the star wars ones yet i like to a lot and a lot of fun too
B009FZHYKU|3.0|The season was good, but there was a lot of buildup going into the midseason break. After it came back, it started to fizzle until the second to last episode. The finale was really a letdown because it could have been a lot more intense and left more questions (enticing viewers to be pumped up for Season 4). It wasn't bad, but it could have been better.
B000Q6GUT8|5.0|Mark Wahlberg is an excellent actor and this movie shows even more why he's so great? Keeps you in suspense and you don't want to miss a second of it!!! The supporting actors are great also!<br />My Mom saw it first on cable and she wanted the DVD. I knew I'd find it on Amazon and I did.<br />Loved this movie.....I'd give it 10 stars if I could!!<br /><br />Ms. P

B00BSBT8M6|2.0|Hey I guess that header says it all no?  Ok the streaming video worked great I give it a 5 star ok?  The movie, however, IMPO thought it stunk much greater than a 5 star streaming thing, ergo............the 2 star.  =)

B000001ES9|5.0|I remember this album from way back in college.  For some odd reason, it sounds even better now than then.  Yes, Neil is not the drummer and the production is just basic, but it all sounds so good.  It has really stood up to the years, almost 40 of them.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This a must Must read book of a True American Hero!  Thank you to the Men and Women of the Armed forces
B004ZN9YNC|5.0|This album seems like a logical continuation of &#34;The Wall&#34;, and the songs here almost as excellent. It is actually much more political, - no major head of state of the early 80s gets a free pass. If you like &#34;the Wall&#34;, or to lesser extent &#34;Animals&#34;, or any of Waters solo work, you'd like this one.<br />As for CD itself - like the remastered quality, hate the packaging - it is a cardboard envelope that will get destroyed faster than acrylic case.
B009DJB8I2|5.0|He says all of the songs are really from Portal 2, none of the songs are made up just for the CD.  He is 12, and he says &#34;It's pretty legit.&#34;  He says he has nothing else to say as that covers it all.  12 year olds....
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|It has been a long time since I got hooked like this! When I finished it, I had to re-read the first few pages to make sure I understood all that had happened. Wow!!<br /><br />Blood Song isn't so different from some other books I've read, but it's so well done. It is similar to Inda by Sherwood Smith, but she couldn't sustain the plot. Ryan does well and doesn't write like he's getting paid by the page. While it's not brief, there isn't a lot of excess here.<br /><br />I can't wait to see where the next book goes!
B0058O84G0|5.0|Love it. I've learned a lot of history. It is easy to learn history this way. Found a couple  of mistakes in Russian revolution though.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|A must have funnnnnnnnn app(: ! Your kids will love the app. Absolutely fun app to have if your bored and thers is nkthing else to do.
B0049VZ222|5.0|I do not typically enjoy gorey fare on tv or at the movies, but the underlying storylines, character development and situational issues that must be dealt with in the zombie infested world of The Walking Dead have made me a diehard (no pun intended) fan. I usually look away during the truly gruesome parts, but it is so worth it so see what this band of survivors will be faced with next.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|This was a fascinating movie. I really don't know what more to say. Anthony Hopkins's performance is so memorizing  and believable. I think it was better than Silence of the Lambs. Absent the credits, I would have had no idea he was in the movie. And Helen Mirren was great too
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I know (from my kids, who are GN fans), that the series does not stay true to the novels, but I don't care a bit. The gritty, barbaric medieval period is realistically brought to life by the production design team and the actors. History buffs will enjoy speculating which real life city/country/historical period is the inspiration for places, people and events in the story. There is a lot of gratuitous sex, but I am told by my resident experts that there is a reason for the choice to include it, so I will keep watching.
B00BESLHEA|2.0|The fight scenes are amazing and Russell Crowe and Lucy Lu give good performances. I can't think of anything else positive to say. The plot and other characterizes were laughable. We literally couldn't help but laugh at how over the top they were.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 1 was amazing, season 2 got a little bogged down, but the writers and producers have turned it around and season 3 was again full of the character development, plot twists and human drama that got me hooked in season 1. I really like how the finale of each season strikes a diffrent note.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Beautifully acted. I love Daniel Craig as James Bond, and I love how they incorporate the old familiarities from the previous films of my childhood with a modern twist.
B007N6NGYG|3.0|I wasn't sorry I got this app, it's okay to play while you're waiting.  Since it was free, I think it was still a good deal.
B001D0BLTA|5.0|It was fun to see this again after so much time.  The soundtrack is excellent and the story line is fluffy but fun.  Great performances all around.
B0012C7ET0|4.0|Good to have some new SN tunes to listen to.  Some of the songs different versions of older ones but still good.  Recommend.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Best way available to view google reader feeds now that reader itself is closing up shop. Magazine style and comfortable menus make for a very pleasing experience
B0087GF8ZG|1.0|I purchased this item and it managed to work for all of 10 minutes, and not sense any motion activity after that point in time. I ultimately bought two other automatic motion sensing night lights which have worked perfectly.<br /><br />This is definitely NOT a quality product and will likely end up where mine did, in the trash.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|My wife and I give the movie 5 stars because the storyline held our interest throughout the movie.  The visual and special effects were spectacular; however, there is much more to this movie.<br />It's hard to say much without giving away the storyline, but in short this movie is about faith, and perhaps how we should all deal with tragedy and adversity.
B009FZHYKU|2.0|Story line has gone boring. Characters and scenarios are now cheesy. Villain isnt that interesting anymore. Hard to identify and appreciate the characters anymore. Little character development. Finale was very disappointing and didnt deliver as it was hyped to. Move on...
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Flash is all it is all it is expected to be. Nice size has adequate power and is easy to use.

0877180121|5.0|This is the same book series _ John Thompson - that I used when I first learned to play and my mother used it as well.<br /><br />Perfect for getting the kids used to finger positions.
B000IKAHN2|3.0|This series mirrors the Stargate SG-1 series almost exactly.  At first, it even seems that the main character, Sheppard is even trying to take on the personality of Jack, which is very annoying.  No, they don't have T'ok, but they do have their own tribal character in Tela and a nerd like Daniel in McCay.  Eventually, they realize Tela can't hack it as a replacement T'ok, so they bring in another strong-silent type in the next season.<br /><br />Also like SG-1, the first season is only mildly entertaining and extremely predictable.  Eventually though, McCay becomes endearing and Dr. Becket's accent carries many of the scenes (until they get rid of him for some inexplicable reason).  If you can make it through that first season though, you'll probably want to watch it until the end.<br /><br />While again, it doesn't live up to the potential a stargate premise has, it does give you some geeky sci-fi to watch when there's nothing else.<br /><br />P.S. In the last season, watch out for the clip show masquerading as a judgement on Atlantis and just skip the second to last episode altogether as it has nothing to do with the style, plot, or point of the rest of the season.  Thanks for wasting our time on that one writers!
B00BF11STU|5.0|This movie is 10 times better than Argo, and I liked Argo.  There were some very real moments in this movie such as the relationship between the interrogators and the detainees, the ever-present danager to the CIA employees in Islamabad and elsewhere, the meeting at the CIA headquarters to decide whether to attack, the jock Seals fooling around before the attack, and the efforts to locate UBL in the compound.  This film should have won the academy award for best movie.
B002UWH8P6|5.0|It's too bad they didn't take this series further, because it was actually really well done.  It takes a much darker approach than the rest of the Stargate series, which I really liked.  It didn't try to be funny, but instead focused on the classic questions and sense of wonder that make sci-fi great.<br /><br />For those who liked the cheesy jokes and two-dimensional characters of the other Stargate series, this probably isn't for you, which is most likely why it was so short-lived.  For those who tolerated the other series but prefer something with a little more depth and intelligence, then this is the Stargate series for you.<br /><br />I enjoyed the complexity of the characters, who could be both villains and heroes and still maintain the lead roles.  I also enjoyed the constant suspense, sense of exploration, and the quest for ultimate understanding that drove the plot.  I guess when it comes to intelligent sci-fi on TV, getting cancelled is just destiny.

B0085Z8F4A|2.0|If you saw the original Ridley Scott film &#34;Alien&#34; or the best of its many sequels, &#34;Aliens&#34; then you should stop right there at number two and say, you've heard and seen enough. However, the franchise has had so many off shoots because the bloodthirsty youth within the sci-fi collective have clamored for more gut-splitting, head-splitting one on one encounters with a creature that has acid for blood (absurd because no tissue could hold it! Think about it! Even one based on silicon, another absurdity as the atom doesn't lend itself to life-forming properties). &#34;Prometheus&#34; is yet another aspect to the &#34;Alien&#34; world giving us a new perspective on its origins, if you were interested at all to begin with (end with a prep, no no). The special effects are dazzling and Scott tantalizes us with another Gollum like creature in the pale alien voyager who would be almost good in a movie by himself. We can certainly believe his naked body is real in the opening scene and the erotic possiblities are endless when you consider the porn industry and CGI combined. However, the film is all too predictable and the ending totally improbable however talent and gifted its director is. See it for its special effects, skip through the gratuitous violence, and marvel at how far we've come in such a short time to create special effects that are quite spectacular - but they alone do not make a good or even an interesting film. Lining characters up to be slaughtered by some monster is neither new nor unique and after awhile becomes a bore, no matter how &#34;pretty&#34; the screen tries to be.
B006S08RLU|5.0|A beautiful, quirky, feel-good foreign flick, full of interesting characters with charming flaws. Great cinematography and music. And of course, Audrey Tautou is adorable. This is one of a very few movies that I can watch more than once. The traveling garden gnome from Travelocity... this is where he comes from!
B007REV4T8|2.0|Scene 7 did not work. All the rest of the film was fine. I had to watch the scratchy part another time, and it was rather crucial in the plot. Packaging DVDs is important, and this one was not too well presented.<br />The move is pretty fun as part of the JB series.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Very entertaining.  Good Series and the books are just as good!!  This is a must watch tv show!  HBO always does well!
B00AB12TEI|4.0|Book is rather interesting to read. It gives some systematic approach to defining your purpose and the path to reach desirable &#34;state&#34; (or rather &#34;dynamic situation&#34;) of your professional development.<br />I have rated book at &#34;4&#34;, not &#34;5&#34; for giving a lot of rather &#34;non-ordinary&#34; cases. They don't suit needs of majority of people, I think.<br /><br />I would recommend to read this book to everybody who doesn't feel that her/his professional live is &#34;completely fulfilled&#34; and to the people who manage other people.

B0018AM1YY|5.0|Neil Young came up in the 1960s and made some of the decades most influential music, but it was his work with Crosby Stills Nash and Young and later his solo career that propelled him to Icon status. On this album is his best work from Ohio with CSN&Y to Heart of Gold to Rockin' in the Free World. I never could tell if his music was Rock and Roll infused with country/folk or the other way around. But whichever it is, it is always meaningful and great. Give a listen.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Received excellent mental pictures of  occurring events but<br />found Sectionsof the narrative a little too wordy.<br />  If you like  Anne Rice and Steven King types of books<br />You will  enjoy the cooks written by these two imaginative<br />Authors.

B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|very very scary, should not watch it alone lol best scary movie i have seen in awhile, definitely worth seeing!
B00BF11STU|3.0|Why is it that it takes two and a half hours to tell a story?  I'm glad I saw the film this way because the movie houses don't do intermissions anymore. Some of us have to have a break.  Also the movie froze in the middle and it took several attempts to get it started again.  Back to the story again, I realize that it was a complex operation but there was a lot of moments, long moments of looking at each other, that didn't move the telling of the tale along at all.  Also why the hell can't the actors speak clearly enough so that we can understand them without having the subtitles switched on?
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I liked the book as a nice change of pace.  It had history,love and redemption.  The characters are well developed.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I often read a book before or after seeing the movie version, and usually find the book richer and more nuanced.  However, in this case I was surprised to find the film version far outshining the original story.  I found the characters in the book to be a bit flat and the location and time line confusing, none of which was true of the film.  So I'm going against my typical advice to read the book whether or not you've seen the movie.  Skip this one and enjoy a marvelous, serious, hillarious movie about a troubled and faulty yet endearingly optimistic young man against the backdrop of an eccentric family of Philly Fanatics!
B00BCOQSSQ|2.0|I was asked to read and review this novel for a friend of mine who had read it and wanted my opinion of it. WARNING THERE WILL BE SPOILERS.<br /><br />To briefly summarize it Owen Sage is a college freshman at a New England university. He is attending college with his two childhood friends Anika and Dante. He is mysteriously drawn to a world called Everville which is described as being between everything and outside of our normal conception of time. Owen first travels to Everville in an astral like manner, thinking at first this is all a dream. He is eventually told by The Keeper who brought him to Everville that he has been chosen to help save Everville from the mysterious \\"Them\\" and his own world by extension, and begins to train in both our world and in Everville for his task.<br /><br />The novel began well enough, but about chapter three I began to get an uneasy feeling about its plot development, character development, and intended direction.<br /><br />I especially found the first half of the novel hard to get through. I had to stop several times to vent frustration I felt as a reader about several moments of unrealized potential and a few anti-climactic scene cuts where a scene would end just before something interesting was about to happen, or it would simply summarize or skip over a part of the scene that I had been led to believe was the direction of the scene due to its build, momentum, and structure.<br /><br />Frustration also came early on in the form of the characters. Characters in general were hard to imagine as Mr. Huff attaches one or two adjectives to the characters and then summarily dismisses any further description. It's often been a critique of romanticism and literature influence by romanticism (like epic fantasy) that they exist in a world where life exists mostly from the neck up with little concern for the neck down. For most of the novel we're trapped inside the head of Owen, how much more \\"neck up\\" can you get besides that? The statement about being concerned mostly with life from the neck up is quite true of Everville: The First Pillar as there is little to no concern for the bodies and physical actions of our characters outside of the three chapters concerning the roundabout and training for it. I still have no clue what Anika or Dante look like (a tremendous problem as both are rather important characters), nor what a marmamook looks like beyond that it's furry, has hands, and eyes (another tremendous problem as this creature is a pivotal character for nearly half the novel). Mr. Huff when in Everville describes the landscapes quite well, but I would ask of him to please devote some time to giving his important characters descriptions equaling his landscape descriptions at the very least.<br /><br />Besides physical description I could have used some further character development, most especially concerning the characters of Anika and Dante whose biggest distinguishing factors as characters are that one is a male friend of Owen's and the other is a female friend of Owen's. There is hardly any development of them as characters beyond that, and their reactions are usually the same and often conveyed in near unison. I never got the sense that either were truly individual characters in their own right, which is a shame considering that they're Owen's best friends since childhood.<br /><br />The setting of being at college becomes less important and less realistic over the course of the first half of the novel. Owen never suffers any consequences in terms of his college classes due to his trips to Everville. In fact he doesn't have a roommate (highly unbelievable that a college freshman in an old New England university wouldn't have a roommate). He also never attends any college classes outside of his one elective of Art History that we see, they are mentioned but they hold no weight or influence on the plot of the novel. I don't expect to see a complete representation of all his college classes, but some acknowledgment that they exist outside of the first quarter of the novel would be nice. This also makes me question why have this novel take place at college if the atmosphere of a college isn't utilized to its fullest. Perhaps his trips to Everville causes him to miss out on writing a college paper or something else, or he takes an astral trip to Everville during the middle of class causing him to miss information that causes his grades to suffer or something like that. Most of the novel is devoted to Owen's participation in college extracurricular activities which are really training for his time to come in Everville disguised as campus clubs. And that's nice, but why does this have to take place at a college then? Couldn't the clubs just as easily be exclusive private clubs and associations of our actual society or of Owen's job, and Owen's a college graduate looking to make his way in the real world? Why have the story take place at a college if its atmosphere isn't going to be important beyond the first quarter of the novel?<br /><br />In terms of anti-climactic moments, besides the sudden scene changes that cut-off promising scenes before they start or skip over them to a later time, I found myself most unhappy with how The Pillar was handled itself. I can see what Mr. Huff is trying to achieve, that it's a great neutral force of nature in the world, which is an element typical of most romances (like The Green Knight of Arthurian romance who is neither good nor evil). However the sense I got from it was that it could solve all the problems of the novel if it so inclined to do so. I would have appreciated a character venting this frustration just once before finally accepting the proclamation of the pillar. In addition, I found Owen's sacrifice and then the reversal of that sacrifice by the pillar to be very anti-climactic and only add to this idea that the pillar could, if it wanted defeat \\"Them\\" with a wave of its hand. Similarly Carwyn's encounter with \\"Them\\"'s army sends your heartbeat racing with anticipation only to leave you with a let down of a disengaging of potential conflict. The army simply letting Carwyn go after failing to convince him to join \\"Them\\" seemed unrealistic and very much was a let down in terms of a building climax, and made me think less of \\"Them\\" as the \\"ultimate evil\\". Also there is a lot of build up to taking a trip to the Hamptons, with a whole subplot devoted to Owen winning a competition that allows them to go. The trip turns out to be very unimportant in terms of the plot and much of a let down comes in the form that the trip only lasts one single chapter, when I was half expecting the last quarter of the novel to take place at the Hamptons mansion we'd fought to get to.<br /><br />Another large problem is that the story spends most of its time in narrating and commenting on the actions of the characters and plot from a distance instead of actively showing these things. It would be much more powerful if we saw how the cave dwellers were negative and pessimistic--a caustic few lines would do, if we were allowed to see for ourselves Anika's dislike of Drusilla in her relationship and interactions with her character, etc. These are just two examples of many more that I could list, but showing these things instead of telling us about them would greatly improve their value to the novel and enhance it overall.<br /><br />Misspellings, awkward transitions (both narratively and grammatically), a tendency for anti-climactic solutions to conflict, and heterographs (like confusing hoard for horde) are Mr. Huff's main weaknesses. I'd advise him in the future to engage in a more thorough and extensive proofreading before releasing his work to the public. Perhaps going so far as to join a group of writers and seek support from fellow peers in the field.<br /><br />What was so frustrating for me though was I could see so much potential for this story that lay undeveloped. And the existence of that undeveloped potential frustrated me to no end with this story time and again and yet inspired me to hope that maybe it might come through in the end. I give the two stars I have for the undeveloped potential that lays there in the novel, but has yet to come shining forth. I hope Mr. Huff in the future considers revising this novel, because I think it could only benefit from such an examination.
B00448SE4S|1.0|This was a waste of money;  I had to turn it off after twenty minutes.  Previews seemed hilarious, but movie was awful.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I use it when I travel which is monthly...it worked Great!  Bright, easy to read and very good wake up tones.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was a fresh view on humanity's future. Great characters and wonderful page-turning plot. I couldn't put it down at the end!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|My first computer had mahjong installed on it, there was only one layout.  Artifacts not only has the tale to follow with a variety of layouts, but the classics with nearly 100 different layouts.
B007FZ7R7W|1.0|And you should feel bad.  Woop woop woop woop woop.<br />  (V).  (;,,,;).  (V)<br /><br />Need better music? Why not zoidberg?  At least he is not alone like zoidberg.  Hes got riahanna who will take him back after she beat her.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|My daughter started our little addiction with Tinkerbell when the first one came out. I own all 4. She got this one for Christmas. It is AWESOME! It is definitely the best of the series. The subplot is complex for adults but the main plot is easy to follow for kids. Adults could enjoy the love story while kids enjoyed the fun. I have to say, this one is a tear-jerker. It is a truly touching story. I like that this was a decent cartoon without all the innuendos and rude humor of so many kids movies nowadays. This seems like it would be an amazing flick for split-families. So touching! Love this one! Love it!
B00B8XC2O0|5.0|I'm sure you have only read superlative reviews of JJ...his fans are often obsessive - they just love the man and his music. Just wanted to say you hardly ever see JJ's cd's at regular outlets and you won't see a lot a second hand stores because his fans don't ever sell. This box set is a good selection and a great price. I think it was a mistake not to include the albums #5 and Okie (instead of #8) but I digress. If you don't know JJ this is a great intro and if you're looking for a gift for someone who loves the blues, country, rock and roll, funk ... they will  love it!
B004V6BQ3O|5.0|I purchased this for my Nikon D7100. I think it works well although the camera already has a built-in microphone. Good for video.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|It was a pretty good film. I thought is stayed true to the Judge Dredd comic. It runs circles around Sylvester Stallone's  1995 Judge Dredd which is probably one the the worst movies of his career.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|I wasn't really impressed with this movie. A die hard Bond fan has to watch it although it could have been better.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it's really good but I can't get a gold ore or a redstone ore thingie and dimond ore thingie in survival. other than that it's pretty good. and awesome.
B00BUL0IHI|5.0|Awesome mix. Various types of music on here keeps you from hearing the same song over and over. Lil Wayne makes another priceless album.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this series!!  I especially enjoy the way they incorporate historical events into the story-line. My only criticism is that I don't always understand what the actors are saying, some have very thick accents - but it's easy enough to rewind and replay if I have missed something!!
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I can't get enough of this show! the acting is great the plots are good. If you like the show on TV then you NEED to have it at home to watch when you want to.
0307744434|3.0|The thing I liked most about the Night Circus was the descriptions. The characters and of course the Circus are described in such a beautiful and captivating way. With a vivid imagination and love for little quirky details, Morgenstern not only comes up with brilliant ideas for every person, place and object in her book but also manages to gift these with a character and personality all their own.<br />Another reason I loved the Night Circus was that it's cohesive. The overall feeling of the book (excepting the main characters which I'll get to in just a moment) was right. There weren't any little details that just didn't fit in the time or place they were mentioned.<br />Now we get to the reasons for the two missing stars.<br />First of all: the main characters. Now I said earlier that Morgenstern had a hand for creating Characters with a capital C. However, sadly this did not extend to the protagonists, Celia and Marco, who often fell rather flat and sometimes came perilously close to being cardboard cutouts (though still quite beautiful cardboard cutouts). I still don't get why they fall for each other, which, this being a romance novel, is kind of sad. The first chapters are all about how they were tortured and abused by their respective masters their entire childhood and yet somehow they both turn magically into unbelievably independent, socially adept and confident (and in Marco's case rather pompous, in Celia's case pretty vain) young adults. Accordingly they were not particularly likable and I had difficulties relating to them as a reader.<br />My other big problem with this book was the plot. It often tended to be on the predictable side and it dragged quite a bit in the middle. The whole first half of the book could have been radically reduced without losing anything important.<br />Is the book worth reading? Probably, especially if you like art, but try to ignore the main characters.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|The last of the Lost series. I enjoyed the Lost experience all the way through. I have watched the whole series twice now. I will probably watch it again soon.
B0000026NC|5.0|This double cd album was out of print and expensive for a new copy.  I rarely order used cd's but I found it on Amazon coming from the Book Exchange (116 E. Little Creek Rd. Norfolk, Virginia) for $12 and change with the description saying the cd's were perfect.  They arrived fast, packed very well, and while the case was worn a little, as described, you couldn't tell the cd's have ever been taken from the package.  Same with the booklet inside.  Oh, and the album itself is fantastic.  Order from this store with confidence.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Toy Story is one that gets played a lot at our house. The kids love it and watch it often. The only thing the kids fight over is which one to watch, Toy Story 1 2 or 3... Kids, I like them all!
B000002GW5|5.0|Man, I had this album in the 70's and I literally wore it out.  Had the cassette in the 80's and it melted.  Was checking out Youtube the other night and found a song from this album.  It was all over, I had to have it again and it's still awesome.
1423140605|5.0|It arrived swiftly and that's all I need for a book I've been wanting to read. A shame I finished reading it already.<br /><br />Cheers.
1781161313|3.0|Maybe I'm being a bit harsh but I can't add a half star. The book reads just like a technical manual with subsets and figure illustrations. In between descriptions of items or vehicles references to Alien (Ripley, the Nostromo) and Aliens (well it IS a colonial marines manual) are sandwiched in to keep giving you perspective. Not really an engrossing read but rather something you can pick up and read a few pages here and there.
B0063IH60K|4.0|First card game for me,its not like the one on the computer that's usually installed but its still good! Worth the free install and buy though.
B008JFUUQ2|4.0|goofy and funny with great music.  rebel Wilson made this movie hilarious and took it to a whole new level.  worth a watch and if you like goofy and funny movies then buy this one it wont dissapoint
B005ZO6NRA|3.0|Just okay.  The movie didn't surprise me at all.  Just for pure entertainment on a boring night.  Oh well. Done.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|the 3d is great and the movie is great easily one of Disney's best that was not Pixar.  and how in the world did they get the licensing for all the classic video game characters.  they did proper respect to all of them
B0012FHGCW|4.0|I thought that this was very well done.  They may have missed some fact about Chris' travels and such, but still a good movie.
B003L77FYS|5.0|Castle & Beckett are still out there &#34;Doing Their Thing&#34;--with Excellent Story Lines--!!--The Variety and Suspense in each Episode<br />is what makes the Show as Enjoyable as it is--and I Recommend this to anyone that likes a good Mystery infused<br />with a little Comedy--WELL DONE CASTLE & BECKETT-!!
B005H9B44A|4.0|Left you hanging for the sequel. I enjoy watching the Avengers and the Marvel super heroes.  Good movie.  Watch it.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Everyone I've talked to feels the same: The first few books in the series were amazing, but the last 2-3 books felt a little slow and dragged out. They're still written well, but they digress from the interesting main-story line too much in my opinion.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|Good book and i enjoy reading it. Also its a good book to read around Christmas time if you want to get in the Christmas spirt
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This is the most fun I've had playing a game...it's relaxing and entertaining. I would recommend it to anyone looking for mindless entertainment, it's a great way to de-stress!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I like this game and like the graphics with the pigs in the helmets. This game will trick and frustrated you but you will keep playing. Once you are hooked you can't put it down.
B004XJRQUQ|2.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy is an interesting book - that's pretty much it.<br /><br />The plot is predictable, there is almost no character development and the writing leaves a lot to ask for. I don't get why so many people seem to be in love with it. Even though the plot idea is a good one, it could have been developed so much better. I would much rather about the main character struggles with her life and how she delas with them rather than her latest crush or her fights in the Games. The character however remains constant throughout. All characters are amazingly one-dimensional.<br /><br />Then again, this book is targeted to young adults...
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Good book<br /><br />I am very thankful to have read it and I hope everyone else who reads it loves it as much as I do
B009AP2G26|1.0|I tried to give them a chance, I really did, but the new crop of performers on Glee are terrible. Not that they aren't talented, but they can't hold a candle to the previous performers and the storylines (other than those connected to the old cast) are super contrived and lame. No chemistry, the performances are so completely bland and uninspired. I want to keep loving the show, but I don't.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is awesome even though it is just a ball falling its still really awesome and there are cute and not cute balls
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|OK, so I have hundreds of Hendrix cd's.  One is just multiple outtakes of the womens' backing vocals on \\"Hey Joe\\".<br />I guess that makes me a completest.<br /><br />Mind you, Hendrix never recorded any of this to be heard by anyone other than him and his jam community.  If you pursue Hendrix material looking for clean, well-polished market-ready tracks, you are missing the point of these types of releases.  Go home and listen to \\"Are you experienced\\" and \\"Axis\\".<br /><br />I approach these releases more of a historical document than a Billboard 500 release. To me, the wah version of \\"Somewhere\\" was enough to justify the purchase of this cd.  I was a little irked at how short \\"Villanova\\" was, but I have the 17 minute version and can get my fill there.<br /><br />Hendrix fans are extremely blessed that this man recorded his entire career at a time when it was unusual to have recording equipment (much less a studio).  The genius of this man, who only had a short time to offer his talents, is not in well-polished LP releases.  You want nice polished releases?  Go talk to Alan Douglas.  He'll hook you up. You want authenticity?  Then you'll have to settle for these releases.<br /><br />For me?  Given the circumstances, I am glad to have anything raw/untouched/mildly molested that the man laid down on tape.  This cd more than fits that bill.
B00B5JBZGS|5.0|Article by PJ Cornell.<br /><br />Originally published in the Asterisked Music Journal.<br /><br />Assessment: 10 out of 10.<br /><br />Bottom line up front: While this band's ultra-intense brand of metalcore may not be for everyone, I would nevertheless venture to say that it is, quite possibly, the greatest album of any genre to be put out in recent years.  (Full disclosure: I've been a fan of this band for a while; I've liked them ever since I heard their album Alive or Just Breathing, and every since they released The End of Heartache, I've considered them to be my favorite band -- so I've got a strong, pro-KsE bias.<br /><br />Highlights: Jesse Leach comes screaming back with a holy, fiery vengeance, shaking Hell itself to its core with songs like The New Awakening (\\"I... WILL... NOT... LIVE... IN... FEAR!\\" -- their best song of the album, which is sure to inspire riotous moshing in the audience), A Tribute to the Fallen (\\"In the end, we will not stand alone!\\"), and, of course, the rhythmically aggressive Beyond the Flames.  Their slowest, most exotic, and gorgeously romantic song, Always, is, paradoxically, perhaps also the most intense song of the release.  A masterpiece.<br /><br />Criticisms: None.  I love that Mr. Leach is back with the band.  My heart goes out to Howard Jones, as he struggles with his diabetes.<br /><br />Conclusion: This is an incredibly powerful album.  If you are a man prone to trembling with righteous ire, then this is the band and album for you.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Am so impressed with this addictive game and will be downloading all updates. I will also b recommending this game 2 all my friends
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I thought the book was really good an there should be more diary of  a wimpy kid books because  I really enjoy them :)
B00B2G2RG6|3.0|It has good acting; however, it is so preposterous at times that I laugh out loud. Still, not a bad way to kill an hour.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I LOVE this  game because I always wanted my own horse and now I have one. I learned about this game from my friend.:)
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Out of this world!!!!! don't miss a single episode. Pick your fav doc. Mine is David Tennant but I love them all.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|It is a dramatic, suspenseful story told well. My only disappointment was the need to Hollywoodize the screen play to try to make it more dramatic. These people risked death; the story doesn't need to be &#34;embellished.&#34;<br />Was nice to see the real hero appear in the end.
B00AQKEPMI|4.0|Hey, we originally reviewed this movie back in April before we started Bowling for Movies!  This is the new and improved review:<br /><br />Rise of the Guardians Bowling for Movies Score: 231.188 of 300<br /><br />What is Bowling for Movies you might ask - it's a score that I, just your average dude, have come up with to rate and score movies.  I gotta lot time on my hands and I watch movies - many MANY movies.  Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  A score of 108 would be a \\"just ok, not particularly good / bad\\" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throw too many \\"gutterballs\\" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea. :]<br /><br />Rise of the Guardians - we own the Three-Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / DVD / Digital Copy + UltraViolet<br /><br />Movie Explanation (no-there is too much, let me sum up):<br />Nimble-footed trickster Jack Frost is called upon to rise to occasion and join the ranks of the Guardians (including Santa, Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy, and the Sandman) when Boogeyman threatens to destroy childhood by changing dreams into nightmares.  Will this diabolical plot be upset by the Guardians... will Jack grow up and take his place among them... or will Boogeyman snuff out childhood dreams and belief??<br /><br />In a day and age filled to the brim with spectacular computer animation, witty dialog, spin on classic characters, and feel good endings - how can a children's film stand out from the crowd?  The answer - you don't.  Why mess with a formula that's working?  This movie certainly didn't break any new ground in those departments.  (Whoa, movie dude - what gives???  You gave this movie a pretty high score to start out like this - where is the love???)  If you're Big Hollywood, here is what you do - if you're not going to INNOVATE, you IMITATE.  And this movie did just that.  Reluctant hero, called upon to save the day; gives up on the task and himself; only to come back triumphant in the end and finding his true place in the world... is it Shrek or Jack Frost - same story, different location - insert holiday theme :]  (hey, Shrek saved storybook critters, Jack saved Holiday belief!!  That's different!!)  Is it?  I know I didn't see this exact same thing in Polar Express or The Santa Clause 3 - The Escape Clause; oh wait - I did.<br /><br />That said, I did in fact give it a significant score, well above 200 and in bowling terms, that's a great game.  It was well written, I enjoyed the spin on Santa (or North as he is known), I more than enjoyed the cinematic majesty laid out in rich, un-ghosted 3D.  What this movie lacked in originality it made up for in bringing vivid animation to the big screen.  The story is been-there-done-that but solid, beautifully told, and brings you quickly from the mundane world we live in, into a world were Santa has tattoos (and you don't mind) and the Sandman doesn't say much (out loud) but WOWs with his presence.  The crime of copy-cat-idous is nothing new, especially in this genre - a more imaginative and original story might have seen this movie \\"bowl\\" a perfect game because it had everything else in place to do just that.  How the technical end of this flick didn't garner at least a nod from the academy is simply beyond me.<br /><br />What I loved:<br />-  Spectacularly animated - wonderfully rich world in vibrant color palette and jaw dropping 3D<br />-  Standard issue story, sure, but told with heart<br />-  I personally appreciated a much more naturalistic view of not only the holidays but the Guardians; what a great break from the battle between religious and commercial interests, at the end of the day these traditions started in veneration of nature (despite where people try to take them, regardless of what they are peddling)<br /><br />What I did NOT like:<br />-  The story itself is a little tired but hey, new audience wouldn't really know that and let's face it - most of America is asleep on their feet and haven't even figured out Star Wars is really just Lord of The Rings (in sppppaaaaacccceee)<br /><br />Hey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly. I will be leaving more movie reviews with bowling scores so check out my other reviews. Bowling for Movies is in no way affiliated with Amazon nor do I have a website or other business interest - I'm just a dude who watches movies (and dabbles in quasi/pseudo-science) :] Want me to review a movie and score it in an Amazon review - I'd be happy to - if I have it, you'll get it.le try to take them, regardless of what they are peddling)<br /><br />What I did NOT like:<br />-  The story itself is a little tired but hey, new audience wouldn't really know that and let's face it - most of America is asleep on their feet and haven't even figured out Star Wars is really just Lord of The Rings (in sppppaaaaacccceee)<br /><br />Hey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly.

B00BESIKWM|3.0|Liked this movie much more than the first. It answered many questions and gave a believable backstory. Production value and acting were pretty good also for a genre film. Recommended, if you saw the first Silent Hill.
B004GUSG4M|2.0|I really couldn't wait to read this based on the reviews.  Short, but sweet,  the first half for me was a total bore.  I almost gave up but kept plodding on.  The second half picked up and the pages were flying by.  Then it ended.  Huh?  The end was so anticlimactic.  It's like the author just wanted to end the book.  I didn't even know it was the end.  I turned the page for the next chapter and.... nothing.  So disappointed.
0375869026|5.0|My daughter, who is 7 and loves to read, said this about _Wonder_:<br /><br />\\"The book Wonder is my favorite book.  It is perfect and I love it.  Everyone should read it.  It gives you feeling and might make you a little nicer.  Everyone should read it.\\"
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I like it. It works great and I have not had any problems with it. I would recommend it to others.
B00AEBB9SM|5.0|I cannot begin to understand how this glorious film failed to walk off at least with the Oscar for best screenplay (that year the Academy chose Shakespeare in Love, bizarrely). I watched The Truman Show again a few nights ago and was struck by how presciently it predicted the craziness of reality television. Insurance salesman Truman Burbank (a magnificent performance by Carrey) starts to crack up as he suspects his life is a sham and he is being filmed to entertain a mass audience. He wants to get out of his little community and finds his path blocked every time, be it by the driver of the bus to Chicago deliberately wrecking the gearbox or the travel agency with a picture of an airliner being hit by lightning under the slogan \\"It could happen to you\\". This is a sly film and you need to watch it several times to pick up all the comedy. The script is magnificent and shows us how the other characters in the show - the ones playing his wife and best friend - have an increasingly tough time dealing with Truman's mental disintegration. He is an animal on display and eventually he decides to escape, much to the wrath of the show's God-like creator. The final scene is particularly good and also very moving. It's odd how Carrey, supposedly a slapstick comedian, starred in two of the most inventive films of recent years: the Truman Show and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, which did win the Oscar for best screenplay.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|Nice back story to Anthony B. I like his narrative style and enjoy his humor. If you like his show(s), then you'll enjoy the book because its pure, unrestrained Anthony Bourdain.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|David Bowie cleverly chose a catalogue of 'best of' Bowie sounds for his comeback: you will find the Berlin sound, the Ziggy sound, the Scott Walker dark sound, the Thursday's Child sound,etc....but Bowie's genius make the songs a piece of art. He knows it all: he disappeared for a decade and he returned with a number one album... Recommended!
B002U1F32M|3.0|But then again i'm not big on the chick flicks, which this clearly is because my boyfriend fell asleep while trying to watch. It's a cute story and I love Zoey D and Gordon but that's not enough to make me want to watch it again. Ok to watch once. My other girlfriends love it though...
0785165975|5.0|This was a gift for a family member.  That member collects these and that person is thrilled to have it added to the collection!  It is recommended to anyone who loves Hit-Girl!
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|Loved it! Love the digital copy that comes with it! Love the extras. All around awesome interpretation of the book.
B003UAMWWQ|1.0|I rented this movie and tried to watch it on my Mac and mobile devices.  The video playback just pauses randomly and doesn't continue.  It happens on my Mac and my mobile devices.  I don't believe it's my connection because the video player shows full connection bars.<br /><br />I watched other movies and everything is fine.  I would like a refund, but I'm not finding a link to report a streaming video complaint.<br /><br />Very frustrating.
B009RH973I|2.0|I was expecting a more flexible shell, I guess. It is very hard cheap looking. The stand was not what I expected either. My bad for not paying better attention.  The strap is great though.:)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|just wonderful I am so addicted!!! you don't understand how great it really is!! it is solo entertaining too!! I cant wait to play it more
B00000ITOY|5.0|Year later update:<br />This continues to be a favorite toy. My one-year-old absolutely loves pulling all the pieces off and playing with them individually. I put her in her superyard (play pin) with this puzzle and she hardly fusses over being left alone and caged. Plus, inside the play yard the mess of pulling off all 16 pieces is contained. I truly am impressed with this toy's ability to capture a young child's attention for an extended period of time. And most importantly, it captures their attention in a intellectually stimulating sort of way. Highly recommend it!<br /><br />Original review:<br />This toy is challenging yet doable. My two-year-old loves it. He will play with it repeatedly, entertaining himself for a good 15 minutes at a time. He has used the circle pieces are pretend cookies, and the rectangles as keys/doors.  It is easy to clean up and takes up little storage space.<br /><br />I love wood toys like this that promote important thinking skills. Plan Toys are safe for your kids and the environment. They are made to last. This will be one we hold on to for a while!
B00005UKKF|5.0|I already own this dvd; it is such a great concert, that I got this one for my sister. For Britney fans, this is an essential; It is Britney at her finest, and the concert was so well done.
B002PJHW4Q|4.0|Great movie. I have seen it many times. Amazon streaming video quality is almost as good as Vudu. Was fine for Prime streaming.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|It's great! Love the graphics but wish there were more worlds to travel to. I would recommend this app to all kids who watched the movie and loved it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Very intense story telling. She describes events and sights so well that you feel like you're there. Very compelling and seems so real.<br />A++!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I loved it at every level, I felt involved as if i were a part of the family - Wonderful!
B005LAIGN2|5.0|good doing business with you!!! My father love this movie great sale price. Keep up the good work. Would purchase from you again.
B000FBJAEG|3.0|Not as enjoyable as some of his others, but riveting nonetheless.  At times I was confused by the number and names of some of the minor characters.  At least now I know how King and Maxwell met and got started.
B006MW3V6U|1.0|The videos were ordered in error.  Our TV is not equipped to receive instant videos.  We would prefer to have a normal disc to play in our DVD player.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love this game. My kids love it too! Just enough of a challenge that it pulls you in and is addicting.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This book was wonderfully written! The characters were very well developed and the plot was ever unwinding. I can't wait to read the rest of the books!
0385535147|2.0|I've greatly enjoyed JG books in the past. But since The Ford County book came out, the level of quality he's writing at is discernibly lower. I nearly didn't bother finishing this one. He's never been strong on character or character development but in this book the author gives us no reason to care what happens to the main character here. The last third is downright ponderous. The first Grisham I've read that was a real bore. And we're living in an era where the 'editors' of these superstar writers don't dare actally do their job, because Mr. Grisham doesn't need an editor, right?
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|smooth process, no problems, quick process, received with no issues, came within a timely fashion, in good condition, thank you
B00AFEY354|5.0|I liked the treatment of the characters in the movie.  The performances by Emma Watson and Ezra Miller were outstanding.  The whole cliche of 'coming of age' film applies, but still, I like it.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|When the Walking Dead first started, I was worried that it would simply be a week by week zombie movie. Despite my love of zombies, even I couldn't watch that. But the show has become something so much more, it's about humanity itself struggling. People lose their human aspects in a fight or flight response, and some manage to actually gain humanity over time (looking at you, Daryl). There of course is still also zombie smashing action, but the show is nicely divided.<br />The third season is a bit of a deviation from the previous two, although it still has many &#34;When Walkers Attack&#34; parts, it focuses heavily on the town of Woodbury. A squeaky clean town with a smart and charismatic Governor. Except that he is also a sociopath in his spare time. This season, I admit, isn't quite what I'd consider well-paced. It seems to have two just okay episodes, then one incredibly good one. All season long. Two okay, one great, two okay, one great. &#34;Clear&#34; and &#34;This Sorrowful Life&#34; being the true highlights of the series to date. The season finale is very solid in setting up the next season, although it might be very disappointing to some people.<br />Despite the odd pacing, less than spectacular finale, and less focus on the walkers, this show is still the best on TV, with better acting in two minutes than is found a years worth of Hollywood movies.<br />If anyone is still curious about the series, I encourage you to watch at least the first three episodes of the Walking Dead, if you're not hooked after those three, you never will be.
B007QUUJMG|4.0|I watched the movie first - which was a mistake as it gave me preconceived ideas of the characters, but it is a very touching story.
030758836X|5.0|I loved this book.  A great mystery which keeps you thrilled and moving to the next chapter to learn something else.  This book is a real page turner and full of surprises.  I recommend it to anyone who loves to read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love this app! great grapglhics and doesn't take a long /ike to load when you are trying to play it. I would pay 0.99 cents for this app!!!!
B00571F26Y|5.0|I have been following the Wheat Belly Diet and using their recipes for several months now.  I have not been religious; I'm sure I eat more carbs every day than Dr Davis recommends.  Nevertheless, I find that simply eliminating the wheat (and gluten) has made a dramatic difference in my appetite and my cravings.  I have been fighting my urges to overeat and my appetites for more years than I care to discuss.  Since I left the wheat behind, I find it SO much easier to control the amount and frequency of my meals.  Many of the recipes are delicious, and have helped me adhere to the eating plan.  My weight has dropped another 5 pounds, and it has happened effortlessly, without me feeling deprived.  I may need to make some adjustments to reach my goal weight (still 5 pounds away), but I am SO happy I read this book, and eliminated wheat from my diet!
B00004XPPC|4.0|Bridge on the River Kwai is a great classic movie and is well worth buying. it should be a part of everyone's collection.
B00B2G2RG6|2.0|I love the following but probably would not pay on Amazon to view anything again. Its a very small viewing area compared to zulu and i had issue with it stopping repeatedly.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Thumbs up a little short for him but a very good read..can't wait for the next one due out this fall... always a great day with the king.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Simply the best! I read it every morning, I would recommend to all my family and friends to get this love it :-)
B0043URV5U|5.0|This does have almost all of his great hits!  It's awesome and great to listen to.  Brings back lots of good memories for me!
B008HK3XU4|4.0|It does do the job of providing protection for the unit. As for the stand, I wasn't in a situation where a flat surface was required. I mostly used it in my lap.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I've been waiting for this movie ever since The Fellowship of the Rings first came out.  I wondered then if they would do the Hobbit with real actors.  Then by Return of the King, I actually experienced anxiety wanting to see The Hobbit in the same fashion.  I was worried that it would not be done and heard no work of it being made for years.  I never stopped hoping though that they were just making them in the order they were written instead of chronologically.  I found this to be very well done as was The Lord of the Rings trilogy.  I was concerned when it ended until I realized that it had been made in three parts and this was only Part 1.  I just hope it doesn't take a whole year more to get Part 2!
B0063GORYU|2.0|It was too small on the 7&#34; screen to really see how I was playing. I prefer the game on my widescreen desktop.
0385523912|5.0|Very timely reading because of the importance of the news coming out of N Korea<br />Wish book had included a pronounciation guide.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Not much to say except this is a very entertaining series. Somewhat predictable but good acting and special effects are worth the watch. Keep em coming AMC.
B009FZHYKU|1.0|Season 3 totally lost the meaning of walking dead. The whole season became a good guys vs bad guys freak show. the focus of the  series was supposed to be about survival against a world apocalypse. instead, this series forgot that the series was called 'walking dead' and focused around a war between living people. Personally, I did not like this season.
B0064MGU98|5.0|There are great twists and turns with infusions of humor throughout. Never watched it on TV, but why would I when I can watch it here…commercial free.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is good I just don't want to write buggy noggin igniting highly having highlight dredged f2f bed doghfhj Cuthbert
B002ZG99G8|3.0|It looks like a movie rip when displayed on the TV screen. 3 menu options total: Play, Interview with cast, Language
B0083DJWGO|4.0|Good book if you enjoy reading about History, Literature and life (yep, antifragility, risk and other topics as well mentioned).
B008M721MS|1.0|Have not really been able to use it.  Hard to figure out what to do.  Not the program as musch as the user.
B00B6OEDS4|5.0|I downloaded this CD for myself on itunes --- then purchased on amazon as a gift for my sister - wanted to share what an amazing CD this is - just beautiful!!!
B001OGPTZ0|5.0|Great follow up album to &#34;Core&#34;. I like everysong. Very talented and underrated band. This band has great chemistry on this CD.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I was actually trying to order a sample and hit the wrong button, but once I started reading, I did not want to put it down. Reminds me of those other books, but was still interesting and entertaining.
B009DP9D6A|3.0|Not the best deadmau5 collection, a few good tracks and a few tracks that I will drop from the playlist.
B00846REIS|5.0|Read the second book first but this one was still really good and entertaining. I'm waiting for the 3rd book. I hope it will be just as good or better than the first two.
B0022W6L6G|5.0|love their songs. MP3 was good quality. Easy to download. Using amazon downloader can be a pain but it transfers to itunes just fine.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I bought this device about 2 weeks ago and i love it. It works very well, I did not even use the dvd drivers that came with it. It is truly a plug and play. I use it with my windows 8 lap top to connect to my wattsview dc solar meter device's serial port running the wattsview software. It works good with hyperterminal, puttyTel, and Ivt serial communications apps/software. This adapter can be used also to change default/reset button settings of a bluetooth rs-232 adapter. Change the bluetooths parameters like baud rate and others using hyperterminal AT command mode.
B006O6F932|4.0|I had my doubts about how this playset would hold up.  It is alot bigger than it appears online and has great detail and the stickers allow you to customize the school.  My daughter had a blast picking stickers for each of her monsters lockers.  Wonderful toy if you have the space to leave it set up...it would be a pain to take the pieces apart to fold it up and I don't think it would last as long.  The finger clip that holds the two sides together is a bit flimsy, but a little duct tape fixes that.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The seasons just keep getting better and better. I can't wait or season 4. I wonder what the governor has in store for them?  I hope they go and get tanks and rocket launchers.
B00BGI08GG|4.0|I really wasn't expecting much initially, but this has become one of my favorite shows. I hope they adjust the price, $62 is a bit much
B007PJFIU6|4.0|The well-rendered illustrations are intriguing and the game is easy and fun for a wide range of people. Two reasons this didn't get 5 stars: unlike a previous version of Dixit, this can only be played by 6 people; and a lot of the cards are dark in theme. I'd like to see a wider variety of cards. The game is designed to be expanded, with space in the box for more cards, encouraging people to purchase more sets or decks. It's one of my favorite games anyway.
B00BL5EQLC|3.0|I got it as app of the day for no cost, but here's my very short list of pros and cons.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Easy to learn<br />Good pacing<br />Still provides challenge in later levels<br /><br />Cons:<br />Overall game length, at the time of this review it had thirty levels total, all of which I got top rating on with a few tries.
B00AQ71FLK|1.0|this wont even install on my kindle fire... it's the kindle tablet edition and it has failed to work at all on my kindle tablet.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|How it all started. One of the best seasons out of all of them. Was one of the better shows on TV.
0345803493|5.0|This series is one of the best I have read. When a book can keep my attention, the way this set does, it deserves a 5-star rating.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I loved the concept. Great build of characters. I really feel in love with them all. The romance was dreamy and romantic. Its only the beginning. The story was merely a warm up and i am anxious for the next one!
0345803507|5.0|I love the way they found each other. She reminds me a little of me, stubborn and hard headed. I love the way E. L. James was able to capture my attention from book one. I will have to find more of her novels. Keep up the good work!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I had boycotted Nicholas Sparks' books the last few years because the formulaic recipe of boy meets girl then one dies had grown old.  This is a new and fresh direction from a fabulous author.  I loved the unexpected twists and turns in the plot and have always loved the character development from Mr. Sparks.  He truly is a great author.  I'M BACK!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The best feature is that it shows the equation that you typed.  I also love the large numbers, so it's easy for large fingers and aging eyes.  Very easy to use for basic math.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|Cut The Rope is a funny , and cute app. I love how it's so different than other puzzle games. Well I am pretty sure that most of them have a cute little monster that has a sweet tooth. Many should buy this app.
B00BKTFABE|2.0|I probably haven't figured it out yet but the only pics I seem to be able to take are of me.  There is no way to take it of someone standing in front of me unless I turn my kindle around and hope I get the picture I want.  Maybe I choose the wrong one but it does not work for me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game and love playing the egg hunt. And whoever doesn't have the app  I say they have to get it. And who doesn't love the chase? Jumping on the trains and collecting coins to unlock funny characters. I think everyone should have this app.
B005K17RU0|4.0|No major issues,  I can see the temp and conditions and that suits me fine.  Helps to know what to expect the day to bring.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I play it every day.  Have successfully gotten 3 stars on many and have bonuses that i am working on.  Great fun
B00BHMF578|5.0|We highly enjoyed watching this movie.  I loved the reality, the story line and the acting.  I would recommend this to friends.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|A continuation of a delightful series. Richard Castle is handsome, clever, imaginative, and funny and takes everyone along for a fun and successful ride. This is a series I can love forever.
B00BF123WG|5.0|We enjoyed the action of this movie.  My husband actually watched it twice.  I would recommend this movie to friends.
B003L77FYS|5.0|New stories, better interaction, and intelligent sexual tension highlight this series. Castle and Beckett are so attracted, but she fights it with all her might. Their sparing is half the fun of this intelligent series. Writer Richard Castle brings imaginative interpretations of evidence into the Manhattan homicide team. Go Castle!
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Rented this movie for my 14 and 10 yr old boys to watch. They enjoyed the movie and say they would reccomend it to other teens to watch.
B000P0J0A6|5.0|I recorded this movie when my son was young and am happy to have a DVD version of it especially since this one is enhanced with unseen footage and lots of extras. A wonderful family film for all but children under six. If you haven't seen it, you've missed a real treat. If you have, you know it can only get better.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|I was expecting more.  This was long a drawn out and boring.  I have seen better documentaries on the history channel.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I didn't watch this series when it first came on and should have. The series is intelligent, excellent acting, delightfully clever scripts, and an ensemble cast that's second to none. This is what good television should be but rarely is. I'm a solid fan of both Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic. They are perfectly matched. As the series progresses, they each learn from the other one and are better for it. I'd like to see this series last for many more years.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I have been playing this game since last March and I am addicted. However, the game is no longer finding updates that are necessary. So it is telling me there are new items that don't actually exist. The game has minor glitches but overall a lot of fun.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Castle and Beckett continue their teasing interaction and solve murders along the way. Obviously, an imagination is an asset to solving crimes since a murderer tries hard not to get caught. After a hundred or more solved cases, it should be time for a celebration between the two main characters, but they seem to continue their fighting, disagreements, and antagonism brought on primarily by the sexual tension between them. Come on, guys, time to get together.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I play this on my computer frequently and enjoy having it on my Kindle Fire HD.  I wish some of the moves weren't automatic
B0090SI42Y|2.0|I usually like Tarantino film,but this one was not on that list.I was totally lost before it got to the half way point.The stunts was as fake as I have ever seen.The acting wasn't that much better.I was very disappointed in this movie...after being so excited to sit down and watch it!!
B0058VW36U|3.0|Not my favorite, but my 5 year old granddaughter loves to play on my Kindle with this application.  She knew how to get the app and load it!
B004YJZ5LM|5.0|Now,I never got the actual blue ray to work in my player,because of regions,but I bought the DVD.This is a great movie,Cung Le is a great actor,and knows how to kick some butt.Add Van Damme,and that makes it even better!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is just like the one on the computer at home.  I love that it is as portable as my  Kindle.  Great Value
B000GCFO0S|5.0|I seen this movie years ago when it came out,and I liked it so much I had to have it on blue ray!!!If you never seen this movie,give it a try,i believe you will like it!!!!
B00683JK9K|5.0|I like to do puzzles.  This is great because there is no puzzle laying out waiting to be finished.  Great value.
B004OZZ624|4.0|Good movie, Liked how he stood by the women he loved when no one else did. Just didn't like what he became to accomplish things.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|The movie tries to make this seem funny and it never is.  It is just poor taste.  Some of the moments were funny but not worth hearing the rest.
B0012FHGCW|3.0|It was pretty long, I wanted a different ending! although I so admired what he did and understand completely why he left.  Just wish that it would have ended differently.
B0018RFLN0|4.0|It's slower in pace than the rest of the series, but it's still a good start and pretty entertaining, as well.
B005PK553C|5.0|So many people were recommending that I watch this.  I'm glad I finally did.  I found it to be entertaining, fun and suspenseful.  There is blood, but its not gory.  It's like a horror soap opera.  Jessica Lange steals every scene she's in too!
B00BHMF578|4.0|The movie was amazing and made me relieve that crazy time. I think that younger people can see that America was just as much to blame as the Arabic peoples for fueling the hatred of America.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Some great soothing sounds, my favorites being  the various water sounds, airplane, frogs, crickets, and a cat purring.  Some people complained of noticeable looping, but it varies from sound to sound...and seriously, of course it's going to loop at some point,  what do you expect?!
B004VYYA2K|5.0|Read the reviews and bought this for my daughter and I LOVE it! Stores all her 12 Barbies with room to spare and the accessories.  The bonus is that it can unzip and then she has another play area for them!!  Great thinking on this one.  Very sturdy too!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I think this is the best weather app on the market right now. Highly recommend this app. The 15 day forecast is great.
B00006RCNJ|5.0|all andre  rieu cd's and dvd's are great  we enjoy them already have at least ten will purchase more sometime
0553381407|5.0|This is a very good book and easy to read - helpful whether you are reading it for yourself or recommending it to a client.
B00BN3EE1O|3.0|I had never seen a Nicolas Sparks movie or read any of his books before.  I enjoyed the film but I don't think I will see it again.  You figure out real quickly that she did not murder anyone and her husband is so obviously alive.  They create moments of suspense when the building burns down but other than that very predicable.  And Robin Scherbatsky keeps showing up as her imaginary friend which just seems a little out of place until the end.
B00AJLHUA8|4.0|This movie was too long, it could have use a little more action it was scarey. Also it was too dark you can lose<br />some of the scarey effects just trying to see what is going on.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I felt like this trilogy kept me spellbound.  I didn't want the books to end.  I did not expect to enjoy the story as much as I did.  It has everything, sex, murder, espionage all the good things for a book.  I would highly recommend this book, as I found it to be the most enjoyable of the trilogy.
B002APU580|5.0|This movie is one of my all time favorites, I have seen different versions of the movie but I think the 2005 version directed by Joe Wright is by far the best. The movie includes an all star cast. Keira Knightly's portrayal of Elizabeth shows her to be a multi-faceted woman who is way ahead of her time. Keira is absolutely charming in the role. It was my first  opportunity to watch Matthew Macfadyen act. His portrayal of Mr. Darcy is unique and brings a different depth to the character. He shows Mr. Darcy to be a  very strong but sensitive and compassionate character. I am now a great fan of him and follow his other movies. as well. Pride and Prejudice is a romantic, fun and a very entertaining representation of Jane Austen's master piece novel.  If you like romantic entertainment it is a must see.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|My wife and I really enjoy this movie on DVD<br /><br />We can now watch with our bigger speakers turned on
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Would like to be able to play Facebook games such as Candy Crush on my Kindle but it doesn't allow me to.
B006H5120E|5.0|By now, everyone has seen this film, but the 3D conversion puts it in a new light. Considering when this movie was released, the 3D works exceptionally well. When the stern of the ship rises from the ocean with the people swimming below, it is just amazing. If you own the proper 3D HDTV, Blu ray player, and 3D glasses, this is the best way to own this classic film.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Graphics are the best part. Overall it was good to see.<br />I saw a different Lincoln than what the history books in school portrayed.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|Bourne Legacy was great. Love everything about this movie. No dislike on this movie at all. Recommend this movie to everyone.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|Despite the lackluster reviews, I was very much looking forward to this movie. But it was more depressing than funny. All the characters, despite their advanced age (ha!), were completely childish and unlikeable. The writing just wasn't as funny as &#34;Knocked Up.&#34;
B00BOLFRKW|5.0|It's a good movie because it's about learning about what happen so it will never happen again. It was very good movie and interesting to learn about how it all started.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|Such fun! Intelligent, entertaining, contemporary setting of the infamous mr. Holmes, who is interestingly portrayed by Mr. Miller, to a T, including and especially the madness of mr.holmes.  Lucy Liu is a nice twist on dr. Watson, (albeit a bit predictably cheesy), but as the season progresses, the interaction gets better and there is more depth, which makes you want to keep tuning in!
B00B0ZT9NI|4.0|I would recommend it to anyone. Ben Affleck always done good movies and he is one of the best actors. Argo is about what happened during that crisis in Iran back around 1980.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Season three of &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; will probably go down in memory as the season of the show that assured it a solid seven year run as most cable series get. It was an even more viscerally violent show as the conflict came to be not only between the living and the dead but between the living as well. With changes of setting and the demise of characters established from the early episodes - and even the show's departure from its comic book source material - it established there was going to be NO usual formula for this &#34;fugitives-on-the-run&#34; type series. The dead, the living and who knows what else will be not only walking but very much alive and kicking for a long run as this riveting third season revealed.
B005HSL626|3.0|ordered this game for my grand kids to play when they came over, i got stated playing it also, it is fun
B006MW3UZW|5.0|What hasn't been said about this fantastic series! It is great story telling and brilliant acting set in England during WWI.<br />I can hardly wait for season 4!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think this game is fun because my little sis loves to play it and it is an adventure game
B009VMN3RA|3.0|I enjoyed Sachi Parker's memoir and I think it was very well worth the purchase. I wish there was more of a . . . satisfying conclusions. I feel like I don't know how it ends but that's likely because Ms. Parker's journey continues. It just seemed ambiguous towards the end. I'm glad I bought it and I'm glad I got to read it.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This has to be the best game on Facebook for the simple reason that your not constantly tuning out of energy like most Facebook games + this game is getting better and is getting tons of new content I heard by the end of this year
B00000K2UX|2.0|I bought this CD after watching the movie on late night television. I like a few of the songs but most of it so dated that my 8 year old son howled from the back seat &#34;Turn it Off!&#34;  Yikes. Maybe I should have just bought the few singles that I like.
B0087EACJK|5.0|This is an awesome addictive game it's only free 4-2-2013!! Get it today but is a puzzle and hard game!!! Totally awesome
B008VBYN80|4.0|I like it a lot. Good game play. Plays with ease. I enjoy the freedom to build what I want.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Another great tale from one of my personal favorites! I'll admit, in my eyes Mr. King can do no wrong. The only crime committed here is that this short went by too fast!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Quality entertainment for people that cringe at what network and cable have to offer. This is smart entertainment with great story lines.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Nice summary of a complex issue.  The Bin Laden raid too dark, confusing, maybe more dramatic license here. J Chastain an interesting actress, look forward to more of her work.

B0091REZMW|3.0|This could be more fun if it didn't require spending more money to get places. Living on a limited income as millions of us are, I try games that don't cost a lot to play and contuinue playing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is as the title states, ENDLESS FUN!! i love all the available characters and boards. simple to play but not easy. awesome power ups. fun for the whole family. get it today.
B009R9WAZ8|5.0|As expected this album did not disappoint. A great mix of upbeat and slow tempo music. On repeat in my car!
B0000TB01Y|2.0|No songs really clicked or became very famous.  Singing is good but music is not very memorable. Guess you have to be watching the stage performance at the same time to really feel it.
B00BF11STU|2.0|The contents of this movie could have been presented in an hour or less. It is very drawn out. I was very tempted to stop watching after about an hour. After all, I knew the ending...
1616550414|5.0|To make this simple and to the point, this book is beautiful. If you love Zelda then you will easily love showing this off on your coffee table to your friends. All the art is top notch and the added timelines of all the games make a great read.
B00C0P08CI|5.0|For far too long, history has condensed the story of the Viking people into a comic book saga filled with primitive characters  raping,  plundering, and wearing funny horns, breastplates, and flaxen braids.  Thanks to the History Channel, we have the opportunity to appreciate an engaging, well-acted, fairly accurate picture of these intelligent, spiritual, self-disciplined, and hardy craftsmen, clansmen, and seafarers whose skills and civilization in the 8th and 9th centuries was more advanced than that of much of the European continent.  Consummate shipbuilders and navigators,  Vikings managed to traverse the deadly seas of the North Atlantic (in open longboats!)  to discover North America centuries before Christopher Columbus was even born. They settled much of Ireland, England, Greenland, Russia, and Iceland. The Norsemen didn't manage to accomplish all that they did by being rage-filled, crude, undisciplined savages.  This show capably demonstrates the high degree of cooperation among their clan, the rules that governed their communities, their work ethic and egalitarian spirit, strong sense of loyalty, and the abiding sense of justice that is still deep, deep in the Scandanavian DNA right up to today.<br />During the first millenium, there was lively trade between Scandanavia and Germany, Spain, what is now Russia, and even North Africa.  Norsemen were justifiably famous for their craftsmanship in building homes, barns, and other dwellings, for painting and needlework, and in fashioning arts from silver and pewter.  They were a spiritual people, as this show depicts, and although their pantheon of gods may seem childish and naive to those of us reared in Judeo-Christian traditions, the Norsemen lived by a spiritual code, believed in an afterlife, and called upon God as they understood Him/Her to protect them and guide them in this life.<br />Not only does the plot of The Vikings keep us engaged from week to week, the casting is just superb.  Travis Fimell dominates the screen as Ragnar, one of the most revered Norse heroes of history.  He is perfectly cast and his is a breakout performance.  His wife, a Shield Maiden, Lagertha, is played by Kathryn Winnick, again a stroke of casting genius. She manages to combine the nurturing Earth Mother presence with a fierce warrior spirit [much admired in Norse legends] and genuine sexual heat with her husband.  Other characters, including Gabriel Byrne, Gustaf Skarsgard etc are equally adept.<br />I have become a huge fan of this well-plotted and well-acted series and hope that the History Channel powers that be will continue the saga into future seasons.ates the screen as Ragnar, one of the most revered Norse heroes of history.

B00BJB2C8W|4.0|For those of you who heard Goblin, and was disappointed by the outcome, don't expect the same jinx here. Tyler has stepped his game back up, revisiting what made this \\"Bastard\\" interesting in the first place.<br /><br />Yes, Tyler still has that IDGAF attitude. He's still visiting his shrink, hates his father, and using offensive 4 (and 3) letter F words to get his point across. Yet he brings 2 more characters in this rollercoaster of a story he's telling in a summer camp named Flog Gnaw.<br /><br />But what makes this album different than the last 2? Well he's bought a house due to his new found success, he lost his grandmother whom he loves dearly, he fell in love, and receives some more fans who thinks he's so awesome that they don't mind givin him fellatio in Six Flags. Tyler has grown up a little, yet he's still depressed about his newfound fame.<br /><br />Lyrically, Tyler stays being brutally honest, sarcastic and funny. \\"My mind is darker than the closet Frank was hiding in\\" is just a tip of the iceberg. Production wise, Ummmm, imagine The Neptunes on acid. Most of the ideas work, few don't.<br /><br />I like the features on this album. Hodgy Beats shines on \\"Jamba\\", Frank Ocean compliments a couple of concepts here like \\"Slater\\" (Tyler's best friend), Bimmer, and (I think that's him) Awkward. Even Erykah Badu gets a piece of this album on the jazzy \\"Treehome95\\".<br /><br />Bottom line, if you are strong enough to tolerate someone like Tyler, you will not be disappointed. He may seem \\"crazy\\", but if u pay attention, he's slowly growing up.<br /><br />Honorable Mentions:<br />Answer<br />IFHY<br />Lone<br /><br />4 out of 5

B002UM5BXW|4.0|As a foodie and former restaurant owner I found this book a great read. My better half didn't like the language or attitude but the reality is that Bourdain is accurate in his story telling and even though we were located in our state's third largest city, nothing like NYC, I heard and saw the same attitude in our &#34;urban&#34; kitchen. After the read I came across a young man who wanted to work in my kitchen; after a few miserable days of sloppy work I told him that he needed to read this book to understand the world he thought he wanted to be in and why my standards on cleanliness and prep was so important. I gave him another week and as of today he has left food service (fired rather for using oven cleaner on my grill top) and pursuing a career as a nurse. Let's just say I plan on avoiding the hospital he gets a job in! So, my point is, if you were ever interested in food service and have dreams of being a fancy chef you seen on the Food Network then read this book for a dose of reality!

B00BHU9BV6|3.0|This is a greatly stylized translation to the screen from the novel by Leo Tolstoy. That is, it is a musical (or wants to be) and a rich tapestry of color, with a \\"painting\\" in nearly every scene. It's too much color for a tragic film like this. There is one scene that looks like a photo shoot for Vanity Fair. Pure white is not Tolstoy. As Anna Karenina, Keira Knightly plays the reckless Ann as a confident woman. Karenina was that, but we don't really get enough suffering from Knightly and Jude Law. They don't seem to gel compared to Aaron Taylor-Thompson and Alicia Vilkander. Their courtship is intense - a better match for the typical Russian angst that is Tolstoy.
0060245867|5.0|My mom read this book to me when I was little and I've always remembered it as one of my favorites. I can't find my old copy so I bought it to share with some of my coworkers who haven't read it. I am a nurse and often joke that our job reminds me of this book :)
B00AZNEW5G|3.0|I was expecting this to be a great movie and ended up disappointed. I enjoyed Nat Geo's seal team six<br /> Raid on bin laden. The navy seals acted like a bunch of cowboys in this movie, talking during the raid and also calling out &#34;Osama,Osama&#34;. This did not happen, the actual seal team six only used hand gestures during the raid. A lot of emphasis was placed on bush era torture techniques. I think the presentation was slanted and artistic license was taken with the production of this movie. I did enjoy Maya's role, just hoped for more accurate storytelling.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|I like this so much--LOVE IT!-- that this is the 2nd copy that I have bought--one for home and one for our summer home.  What a happy, wonderful album.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|I picked up this book since the movie is not yet out on video and it is getting such good reviews. I'm so glad I did. I was able to read it in one day because its one of those books that keeps you reading, you don't want to put it down.<br /><br />If you have ever been through anything in life that threw you for a loop, this is the book for you. What is it that pushes some people over the edge and yet others maintain their normal life? This book will make you laugh and cry.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Who can forget 1992's 5 Oscar masterpiece which elevated Steven Spielberg as one of the most honored film directors of all time?  This story is based upon true events of the dark days of World War II in Europe when the Jewish persecution and subsequent innilhation (labeled &#34;the final solution&#34; by the German SS, the most ruthless arm of the Nazi Party) was more horrific and inhumane than the bullets, bombs, bayonets faced by soldiers in battle.  While the Geneva Convention governed the &#34;rules of war&#34; no such protection was afforded the Jews in Europe.  Oskar Schindler, an enterprising industrialist, forged an uncomfortable alliance with Jewish tradesmen, accountants and captives he would label &#34;skilled workers&#34; in support of the German war effort and in doing so, save them from the gas chambers.......Liam Neeson portrayed Schindler as a conflicted, morally corrupt businessman who saw more profit in the Jews ( rather than an ethnic annoyance); his shrewd dealings with dishonest SS Officers to further his success helped save over 1000 men, women and children from the gas chamber.  Ralph Fiennes (I believe his first starring role) cast as the  Camp Commandant was excellent as an evil, lusty and morally void demon whose unpredictable moods always had a fatal result on the interred populace; Ben Kingsley, in an emotionally strained performance as Schindler's accountant and bookeeper, was believable and was the heart of the story.  Spielberg's masterful use of lights and shadows (filmed in stark Black and White) conveyed the dreary hopelessness of camp internees and the endless horror they must have experienced when at any moment their lives could end; families separated and segregated as cattle would be preparing for slaughter....The relationship between Neeson and Kingsley, at times tempestous, was the true story here; both were believable  despite the master-slave role.  Fiennes, like the Karloff Monster, inciting terror and demonstrating a mercurial temperament (witness the scene in which he climbs out of his bed leaving his naked lover, casually strolls to the corner where a rifle rests, picks it up, adjusts the telescopic sight, strolls out onto the balcony where he scans the camp yard below, sees a woman pausing from her chore and he coldly raises his rifle and shoots her in the head, calmly rests it against the railing and returns to his bedroom unnerved by his act) The inhumanity demonstrated by the Nazis has been well documented throughout history and this film is but a microcosm of their dubious deeds; I do not remember why I chose to add this film to my library but in watching it for the second time I found its message, story and portrayals to be as emotional and compelling as it was twenty one years earlier; I cried at the closing scene and ending credits---my testimony to this remarkable film.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I thought this was very creative and thoughtful. I look forward to reading more from Colleen Hoover. It was a great read.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|Great read<br />Get the series and watch it too. Got to love the stark family. F the canisters. I love my dog too.
B009POHHRG|3.0|Comics and graphic novels are kind of cool on the kindle BUT here is the problem:<br />They are too expensive for something I can't collect, resell, or bag and board.<br />Had I known that this was such a short trade, I wouldn't of popped 10 dollars to read it. A new pricing system needs to be put in place for digital copies or offering a discounted or FREE digital copy to the hard edition would definitely be an alluring marketing strategy DC and Marvel could start tossing around.
B00BI745AA|4.0|A bit long, but enjoyable film.  A bit dark for some though.  Should have purchased it instead of renting it.
B005S9ELVC|3.0|Sean Penn acted really well and is really the saving grace of this film just for his performance. The film is based on a group of policemen who decide to do some co-corricular work and looking for the bad guys. It is a cheesy mix because the director tried way too hard to make the film stylish but overall the impact was not even remotely felt. There are hardly any memorable scenes in the film save the ones where Sean Penn is delivering dialogs. Ryan Gosling does not come anywhere near his potential in this film and speaks dialogues with a queer italic voice.<br /><br />Gangster Squad had an ok story but the camaraderie between the cops was cheesy.<br /><br />Despite being a period film, it looked way too stylish, it seems in every scene the cops are posing.<br /><br />The cop who's African American says only one or two dialogues. It seems the editor was over-worked. The action is very average.<br /><br />Why are there so many one to five second scenes? This is not even a music video. Utter waste of beautiful sets. There were times I couldn't believe how or why the film was ever made because there were so many holes.<br /><br />I give it three stars for the good acting by Sean Penn. Otherwise a very forgettable film.<br /><br />Watch but do not own.
B00B0ZT9NI|4.0|Very good film.  Enjoyed the level of suspense .... I'll watch this again in a few months since I bought it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is just a short synopsis of the background, customs of the times and relationships of the folks at Downton Manor.  Good info.
B0078Q2HAA|2.0|This was a disappointing film.  I can see where the director was trying to take this, but it was not what I would consider worth watching
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I enjoy reading about court dramas and this covered a lot of court proceedings and legal terminology. The suspense of trying to figure out who done it. If you enjoy reading about court and defense and prosecuting attorneys you will enjoy this book.
B007HWTQQ8|5.0|I try to watch this with my granddaughters once a year during Lent to remind us of why we celebrate Easter.
B009O2XY12|2.0|My only issue with this game is you have to wait 35-40 minutes to refill after you die.  Unless you want to pay to continue.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I loved this game. It played great on my fire. cost is really great.I took about 2 days to complete. Big fish you hit it out of the park with this one!  please keep them comming.  I cant wait for part 2.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love this game.  The only problem is the game resets it self and I have to start back from the beginning.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book was an awesome read. The storyline was good and constantly had me wondering what the outcome would be. The ending had two surprises that I did not expect. I can't wait to read the next book. I am a fan of Orson's just from this book.

B004U8ZH8S|4.0|I was glad to be able to rent this from Amazon for my granddaughter, especially since Vudu had it only for purchase. What about my favorite Disney film from when I was five, Pinocchio ?
B00BVYNSLC|4.0|Seems like a great new show. Hopefully it will continue to develop and get even better. My only complaint would be that sex scenes seemed a bit forced and really unneeded in the plot line.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham does it again!  I have always found John Grisham's books to be great reading (Have most all of previous books) and &#34;The Racketeer&#34; did not disappoint!  Traditional Grisham, found it impossible to put it down!  I just might read it again...  Loved it!

0375869026|4.0|In \\"Wonder,\\" R.J. Palacio teaches (or reminds) readers about the value of kindness, fickleness of popularity, importance of communication, undulations of (even strong) friendships, and differences in perspective that underlie not just middle schoolers' reality, but all our lives - in a way that is both relatable and readable (e.g., \\"My mother is the kind of person who has a happy face for the rest of the world but not a lot left over for me.\\").

B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is a real page-turner.  All of Nicholas Sparks' books have romance, but this one had suspense, and some twists you just don't see coming.  I had a hard time putting it down, and was disappointed when I was finished because I so enjoyed reading it.  Sparks' skill at character development makes you feel like you really know the people in his books!

B007SPN5MA|5.0|Something about this album's mood feels very 70s &#34;adult contemporary&#34; (was it even called that back then?) to me. May be heretical to say, but I think I like this album even better than the Swell Season album I purchased at the same time. Still spinning this one on a regular basis. Great stuff!
B00B8XC2O0|5.0|jj cale is the the real deal. he doesn't need publicity or an audience to play the music he writes. just an overlooked superstar doing his thing his way. I have all these albums but you can bet I'm  ordering this. do yourself a favor order for yourself and a friend. they will appreciate it. traveling light!
B00A83075M|4.0|My kids loved this, so we got it for my daughter for her 4th birthday along with a shirt and the book.  She was THRILLED when she opened it, and that in itself was worth it.  :)  It does have a good story line for kids, and makes them giggle especially when they use potty words (\\"doodoo face\\").  However, I didn't like that my pretty little girl repeated it for a month.
B0069G5Z9K|1.0|I hate this game, it is frustrating and difficult to play. The first two parts or scene are easy, but after that, it gets difficult.
B00947N6D8|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie, and Mom is typically hard to please (who, me?).  :)<br /><br />It had a great concept.. I would definitely recommend.
B0090NNQX6|5.0|I can honestly say, I can listen to this songs all day and never get tired of it. I don't understand why he is not a as big as some of these lame pop artist. Our society these days rejects anything that good and it doesn't make sense. His music tends to have storytelling aspect to it and that's what makes it interesting and easier to listen to. I highly recommend this album.
B000P0J0D8|5.0|THIS WAS AN ANNIVERSARY GIFT FOR MY HUSBAND. WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND THIS MOVIE FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS WITHOUT SUCCESS. WHEN I SAW AMAZON HAD IT I WAS SHOCKED! NEEDLESS TO SAY, MY HUSBAND WAS VERY SURPRISED TO GET THIS. THANK YOU!!
B00B89WXYS|5.0|Once again, One Republic has shown that they as strong as ever. Every song on this album is great, thus making the album magnificent. With each song, you feel the sense of emotion and hear the voice of substance. This band has proven itself to be a real power-force.
0307352153|5.0|After six months I finally got around to finishing the last couple of chapters of this book tonight.  What a great read! As an introvert the book has given me a better vocabulary to describe my world and to help inform my more extroverted wife on how we can define a balance in our relationship.  Susan Cain﻿ does a great job in weaving her research into a strong narrative.  This should be mandatory reading for every teacher, manager, and leader out there.  Well done!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a good game to occupy children. My nieces, nephews and little cousins downloaded this game on their kindle and other tablets and they can play this game for hours without feeling bored. I downloaded on the my phone to see what was so fascinating about it and I really enjoyed it, but I was sick of repetitive scene. One of the kids make a comment like that too, she said the game doesn't have level, just the missions. I would recommend downloading it.
B00932AA5G|4.0|Hard to describe the movie - it's twisted crime and murder caper with a sometimes gross sense of humor that's totally unbelievable but it takes you on a perverted run that's great fun. Don't look for deep meaning-doesn't have any- don't know what it is about some of these foreign movies but they re so over the top (in a good way). Thanks to Amazon Prime, I get to enjoy these little gems that otherwise I would never find.
0345531965|5.0|What a testament to a great writer Well done.  One of his best I have read makes up for Calico Joe
B00BF11STU|3.0|First, let's get this out of the ways since a LOT of the discussion is whether the movie justifies \\"enhanced interrogation or not\\". Unequivocally, the answer is YES! The first 1/2 hour of the movie is devoted to \\"enhanced interrogation\\" scenes so it's a pivotal foundation for the rest of the movie. The rest of the movie lurches to the ultimate climax of the raid and killing of the \\"bad guy\\". The buildup and the end is clinical, no big drama, and the actual raid is somewhat of a downer.  I thought the director's first work \\"Hurt Locker\\" got way too much positive credit and the same is true here. It's fairly obvious that her political leanings are towards the right, not overtly so but a definite tilt that way, which probably is a minority position given the left leanings of Hollywood in general. I'm not posturing whether one way is right or wrong, just pointing out my opinion of how this director paints her pictures (though probably muddled by her conscious effort not to appear so). In the end, it's all about movie-making, and this movie falls short of gripping war drama. Worth renting so you can interject your own politics into it - just don't expect a great movie.

B00BFUUMO8|4.0|This game is fun and a bit addictive. You can create new dinosaurs from DNA that you find as you clear land. You can build your own Jurassic park with help of the movie characters.... downside  to the gamee is it takes a while to advance levels, and sometimeos if  you leave the game and come back the stuff you did right before leaving is not there.... graphics on the dinos is pretty good too... so overall its a nice game
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Great fun wish it didn't. take so long to earn the gold bars or so many minutes to get lives.

B005NFVZTM|5.0|A great prequel to the series. Find out how everyone got their start. If you like the series, it is a must watch.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My 6 year old and I love playing this! Only downside is it either doesn't load or takes forever to load
0440237688|4.0|.<br />As an English teacher I often have to develop units of study around existing class texts. The Giver is a good utilitarian book for a young adult program that might include an introduction to utopian / dystopian concepts. We trot it out with Animal Farm and it gives us material for discussion. On the down side, I've not seen students who actually enjoy reading it, which makes it a classroom workbook. It's a big success in YA literature and not in danger of going out of print, and this review will disappear among thousands of raves, yet I feel badly for not touting Lois Lowry, who has earned great success with it.<br /><br />I do use her book, but to make the unit more lively I'll add the Kurt Vonnegut Jr. short story, Harrison Bergeron, which can be found for free in an internet search. My students might even analyze the lyrics to, The Big Rock Candy Mountain (where life was a perfect utopia, but they \\"hung the jerk who invented work\\").<br /><br />This is a good story told at a suspenseful pace, and it includes some engaging emotional elements that can capture the interest of young readers in spikes. Overall, it doesn't have the magic an English teacher looks for in teaching children to love books. As an adult I can analyze it and appreciate why it's good, but if kids don't enjoy a book, that must also be considered.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Great season.didn't like how the last episode ended though would have loved to see the governor killed off. Glad to see Rick doing better
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the vivid story telling and very well researched biography of Lincoln and his cabinet. It has provided hours of discussion in our home and among my friends and cemented a deep respect for our most able president and, possibly, greatest American ever.
076421120X|5.0|Darlene Zschech is a woman I have long admired for her song-writing ability and her heart for Jesus that is so apparent through all she writes. Her new devotional, Revealing Jesus, is just as worshipful as any song she's ever composed!<br /><br />Each day has a short, yet thought-provoking, devotional accompanied by Scripture and a short prayer at the end. She includes hymn lyrics at the beginning of each month, which I loved because it reminded me of the depth of meaning found in most older hymns.<br /><br />I haven't read all 365 yet (didn't want to rush through!), but the ones that I did read were wonderful, and this will definitely be a book that I read through over and over.<br /><br />If you're looking for a fresh devotional to use each day as you spend time with the Lord, I recommend this one highly. It is worshipful, and there is also a worship CD that you can buy that goes along with the book.<br /><br />I received a copy of this book from Bethany House publishers in exchange for my honest review.
B00364K6YW|5.0|True to both the language and the feel of the book. The acting is superb. And the bonus is that it is visually beautiful.
B007I2BZIE|4.0|It's definitely not the old school Rush, and not the 80's Rush either.  It's something with more punch but less of an experimental sound to it.  The production values are great, and this fresh sound of songs from the Canadian trio flow together nicely to make a story.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Big Fish is a whimsically serious exploration of fact and myth, of father/son tensions.  Edward, the father, entertained his son William from childhood with an embellished tale about Edward's life.  As William matured, Edward never adapted the story to something closer to the facts.  This creates a rift between them as William feels he has been duped by not hearing the \\"real\\" story.  When the old man becomes ill and is dying, William discovers perhaps there has been more truth than he realized in his father's myth, and he even participates in giving the myth an appropriate ending.  I like this film.
B000I9WW0E|5.0|I haven't seen this in a while so was glad to pick it up on Blu Ray.<br /><br />The video is of excellent quality, showing off the Blu Ray format nicely.  Clearly a fresh high resolution scan and not a rehash of the DVD.  The studio obviously put some effort into it.
B004SIP6QI|5.0|Based on one of my favorite novels, this movie does the book justice.  It is an achingly beautiful story set during the U.S. Civil War.  Inman, a wounded and disenchanted Confederate soldier, decides to leave the war and walk back home to his sweetheart, Ada.  The story moves back and forth between his considerable challenges and Ada's as she attempts to survive on a farm in troubled times.  Raised as a protected minister's daughter, she is totally unprepared to be self-sufficient.  Fortunately for her, a drifter named Ruby shows up.  Ruby is consummately prepared to manage the farm and she trains Ada to assist.  Fortunately for us, Ruby is played by Renee Zellwiger, a highlight of this film.
0425263916|5.0|I love this author she is amazing. I was never big in to reading but every book I have purchased from Silvia Day I cant put down. NO LIE along with a few other authors. It always took my parents there all to try to get me to read, but she just makes it a whole lot easier for me to elect on my own to do so. Its a must get!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book, I read the sample and after that I was already hooked! I recommend this novel to anyone who likes reading.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|What is not to like about the piano guys? They make instrumental music fun. I highly recommend this CD to anybody who enjoys instrumental music.
B00BQPEIT2|1.0|I was so happy that any oz game would come out but whenever I try to download this there is a problem with the installation. It list this as one of my<br /> apps on my amazon account but it does not appear on my app list. I was still charged the .99 and I am very upset and angry.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Gives you perspective to your proems, makes you appreciate your health and the potential of what you can do with it.
B006QQQ5SI|4.0|I had low expectations of this movie and was pleasantly surprised!  It kept me entertained on a long flight and when I got home I bought it to watch on the big screen.  Birding does not interest me, however, after watching this movie, I'll have to reconsider!  Made me want to pick up the hobby.  :)  The movie was funny, had great acting, and they even threw in some interesting facts about birds and a few pieces of great photography of birds.  It is one of my current favorites.  The headnote to the movie:  &#34;This is a true story.  Only the facts have been changed.&#34;  Funny---I stared at that statement for 5 seconds before I got it.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|What was this? All the glowing reviews lead me to wonder what I am missing. It is supposed to be free but it appeared to require a purchase to accomplish anything.
B001UE27X8|5.0|I have always really liked Tony Bennett and Bill Evans and I Am so happy to have found this recording. They are wonderful together.<br />I am a pianist and singer and I truly appreciate the accompaniment of Evans to the story telling style of Bennett. I only wish there was more!<br />Also, great  music for a romantic evening.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|My husband has loaned these out to many co-workers and friends to watch.  Many have since have signed up for HBO just to get this series, it is THAT GOOD!  We have had friends over for the last few weekends that have stayed over until 2am!  This series is completely addictive!  I think we need to contact HBO for a sales commission!
0385528752|4.0|I recommend this book for anyone who needs to know what it takes to change somebody's mind. It is very useful for anybody in advertising, social movements, politics, management -- wherever you need to influence attitudes. The authors present basically social and psychological theory with very readable explanations and down to earth examples. Well worth the investment.
B003ZFCBJ0|3.0|I read the book first and can not understand why they could not make the movie closer to what the book reads. It is a good movie if you have NOT read the book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|So far, I have viewed Season 1 and Season 2....I think it has a believable story<br /> line , the reality of WWI and the way the soldiers have been portrayed plus, the hospital and therapy afterwards. Each character seems very authentic and<br />sincere.  I must admit, I am not fond of all the characters and naturally have my<br />favorites;  however, the role they each play is done very well.  I always looked<br />forward to viewing another episode.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Very fun makes time fly. I like the challenges....easy to play and I really like that you can turn off the timer and rearrange the tiles when you get stuck. Thank you for this game it's my favorite can't put it down!
0394800389|5.0|a classic dr seuss.  definitely one of the &#34;must haves&#34; for a child learning to read on his own.  great addition to any library
B0041D843M|1.0|I must admit, I did not finish reading the book.  I grew weary of the author's self-imporant reminders of his own accomplishments and expertise in the field.  I have found many other books on nutrition, including Nourishing Traditions by Sally Fallon to be much more comprehensive and relevant.  Foods like dairy and meat have proven to be essential for my family's health and vitality, but only because we eat them in their pure, unprocessed forms.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Spoiler alert!  In the event of a zombie apocalypse, Walking Dead Season 3 is an excellent how-to guide in survival.
B0054R6BFM|3.0|It was a decent book that covered a sad topic. The only trouble I had was the rapid switching between narrators. I'm not a dummy, I swear.
B008X8RSTM|1.0|I fell like I just threw 2 bucks out the window.  I ordered what I thought was a map of France and it let me download 1 area of the country, but it was mis-named and I got an area of the country I did not need nor want.
B009PQ5Y4M|3.0|I saw the original Alien when it first came out in the late 70s. \\"Aliens\\" was a decent sequel but after that they disappointed. I anticipated this movie like the birth of a child and saw it the first day. The concept was wonderful and who better to do it than Ridley Scott. The first half of the movie had some problems, but I was still drawn in by the idea. But as soon as they landed on the alien world the movie took a wrong turn and kept getting going in the wrong direction. I think Ridley was allowed to do the movie ONLY if he sacrificed the second half of the movie to satisfy the Hollywood movie moguls who want to sell scary monsters and violence not lofty concepts and theories. The second half was so ridiculous and unrealistic I felt like I had witnessed a still birth.
0064430170|5.0|Usually, a book that puts me to sleep will get only one star, but because this book puts my child to sleep, I will give it 5 stars.  I really like the way it was written.  This is a classic I will read to all my children.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Brilliantly written. Do yourself a favor and read and then enjoy each word. Savor the magistry of a book well written.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend of mine who really enjoyed this book.  I, also, enjoyed it but found the story and the characters more appropriate for a young adult audience than a more mature one.  It was well written and there was somewhat of an unexpected ending and, for that reason, I would recommend the book for any age group.  It is, however, appropriate for the  members of the female gender.
B001QWBM62|5.0|This is a must have for all DSLR shooters it's a studio and mic in your pocket for under $300 nuff said.
B009AMANBA|4.0|The film was well done and presented an interesting perspective on Lincoln's political process.  I'm not sure Daniel Day-Lewis deserved the Best Actor award.
1444710338|2.0|Not something that my wife and I will  be following. too complicated and the menus do not look very appetizing.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|This is an exceptionally well done film, costumes, sets, acting and directing all top shelf. It is a good reminder of the total fiasco of Prohibition and highlights the same issues for prohibition of drugs in this country. We would be so much better off if drugs were legalized in the good ol' USA. If you grew up on the East coast and went to Atlantic City for all your summer vacations the film is quite nostalgic. Beautiful fil all the way around. I recommend it for anyone but especially for baby boomers on the East coast.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|works well for kindle fire. could use a big old snooze button. compared the scteen size but two. thumb up. I like the weather feature. all this said before I dig into the features completely.
1616550414|3.0|Not what I expected, and from what I can tell what others expected either.<br /><br />As others have indicated the first 66 pages of the book are solely for the latest game.  The book is mostly artwork and little Hyrule Historia.  It would have been nice to see more screen shots of significant moments in the games, monsters or secrets.  What about pictures of how its affected the social arena in terms of merchandise.  Basically the only thing they captured was an artists rendition of the characters in the legend of zelda games.  Very one dimensional book.
0525478817|5.0|I am not a YA, I am a middle-aged woman.....but this book was fantastic! Written well for all audiences. The author makes you feel the relationship and the pain.  This is a book I will re-read many times!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I ordered the 3D version but not have watch it.  Waiting for family members to view this version with us.  I'm sure it going to be awesome...I read the book.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|I'm a huge comic book nerd.  Iron Man has always been a fascinating character due to the alcoholism and overall outgoing attitude.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. is such a perfect fit for the character of Tony Stark, that it's impossible to assume that Marvel Studios was tempted to pass on him when Jon Favreau got him for the role.  He has single handedly helped Marvel's comic movie franchise.  Due to his role in Iron Man (and 2), they were able to expand with Captain America, a new Hulk and Thor.  All to tie these movies all together with The Avengers.<br /><br />None of this would have happened if Iron Man didn't hit the ball out of the park in the crushing nature that it did.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I watched the first episode and was hooked...finished the series in about 36 hours...who cares about sleep or work.  AWESOME!!
B0051MKMNC|5.0|When a lot of people think of Bradley Cooper, they think of The Hangover series or possibly Silver Linings Playbook.<br /><br />These are great films, but he really comes into his own as an actor in Limitless.  I love the concept of this movie, and he pulls it off without a hitch.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I really enjoyed the characters, I cant wait to see the movie.  I never thought about what the family of the accused was  going through, it was very interesting.  I felt for them.
055358894X|5.0|This is one of my favorite books in the last few years. Unique story and characters that you end up caring a great deal about. Very well written and full of surprises.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|The story line was interesting, but finished a bit vague.  The hidden objects were Ok, but there were too many located in complete darkness and some were too small to see or make out.  I like to try to get through a game without using hints, but the items were too hard or too small to see so using helps were necessary.  Not bad for the price.
1469984202|5.0|This book grabs ahold of you right from the start and doesn't let go. I stumbled across WOOL while searching for new science fiction books to read and I wasn't disappointed. Best book I've read in years.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Great Show! I am really hoocked. Can't stop watching. I keep saying one more episode, just one more, and before I realize, the weekend is gone.
0307887448|5.0|If you grew up in the 80's, and spent a great deal of time playing video games, then this book is definitely for you. Unique and engaging story that is full of references to the 80's culture.
B004GHNIRK|1.0|This book was horrible... I haven't the slightest idea why everyone thinks this book is so great. I have only two words to describe this book: Unfathomly boring and extremely overrated. I didn't even finish it. Oh yeah it's that boring. Read at your own risk....
B00B5JBZGS|5.0|First off, let me get this out on the table...Howard was a great vocalist, and so is Jesse. Your decision on whether or not to buy the music shouldn't be based solely on your preference of one vocalist over the other. Listen critically to the song arrangements entirely before making a judgement. But the fact is folks, regardless of who you prefer as a vocalist Howard or Jesse, Killswitch is one of the few metalcore bands that make GOOD music. Aren't you sick of the relentless pattern of breakdown breakdown chorus breakdown that plagues 80% of the genre? Although Howard is gone, one can still sense his presence in some of the inspiration of these tracks, \\"Always\\" comes to mind. I myself prefer Jesse as the vocalist. I never thought Howard had the right voice for the genre. He was a unique vocalist no doubt, but there was always something too...bluesy about his voice that made me prefer Jesse over him. With Jesse back, Killswitch found their roots again.  And I will say that this is their best since Alive or Just Breathing. Jesse has matured as a vocalist, the songs are very well crafted and arranged. I'll even go one further and say that this is THE BEST Killswitch album. Ever. Period.<br />---dear Howard fan boys, quit crying.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I enjoyed this telling of heaven from a scientists point of view.<br />His story and miracle recovery are faith building and proof of God and heaven.
B0013TPV0Q|5.0|This is quintessential David Sedaris....I cannot read this book in public because I constantly burst out laughing.  I can't wait for his next book.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I chose this rating because the book was an easy read, and it was difficult to put it down when I started. It gave me a different view of what our servicemen and women went through in Iraq.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|I love this movie so I was super excited to find it on sale for under $4.  Looking forward to the next one!
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|More of the same, this trilogy just got way too predictable for me.  But Lisbeth is still one of my favorite heros of all times!
B007ZKY7XO|5.0|if you like music, dance music, gay dance music, or gay dance music by a gay group or artist, then you'll like this great, fab cd.
B007FIY3VW|1.0|I wrote something for a class and I saved my document. Then after I left the app the document disappeared so not worth the money
B006G2124E|4.0|This gave us insight as to the treament of our sisters in the south.  I had a dear friend Nell while living in Michigan .  She cleaned our home and I only trusted her with my children.  This was in the 1960's and she ask me what I thought about the civil rights movement?  I knew  nothing about it.  Ignorance or never encounterd  or my head was stuck in the sand.
B0093OGBL6|5.0|I love reading this book and hope others will do the same and seek truth on Michael.. This book is excellent and I really enjoy reading it.. Once you read it, you'll understand what Michael had to go through and who is really was.. I really love this book and got a bit teary eyed on reading what Michael endured during his life.. I really hope more people would read this book and understand the wonderful man better. Thank you so much for this book dr  Moriarty! You've captured it all.. :)
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|it is just challenging enough but not frustrating for a novice game-player like myself.  i can get lost in the fun.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Just started using this app so far it has been great. I will recommend this app to my friends. Super!!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Engaging and exciting storyline. Liked the characters and how their roles helped bring the story to life. Looking forward to watching the movie now to see how it compares.
B009FZFONO|3.0|But overall way too much talking and not enough action this entire season. And the final conflict between the two groups was kind of stupid. Let's step it up next season!
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I love the sound, the lyrics, the messages, but the most striking thing about this album to me is how pumped it makes me feel.  There's a lot of passion and strength behind Macklemore and Ryan Lewis, and I can really feel it through the speakers.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|One of the best books I've read for a long time!  Well written and a plot that kept the outcome secret until the last page.
B00021HBGS|2.0|They don't stay on tiled walls and there's not really enough room on the bathtub to put them while bathing.
B0050Q3TDY|4.0|This app. gives you access to 25 Jazz stations with varied types of Jazz. Good sound, streams well.  I have the free version which does have occasional commercials.  You can opt for the paid version with no commercials.
B0026P3G12|5.0|great. I love this singer and enjoy her voice and her story. I highly recommend this CD for you !
B005P3NPQS|5.0|i would go to this concert, this shadow concert. but. im sortof confined to my own warped little head. i wouldnt be able to handle it. so im not going. so what. at least i dont have to kiss up to my little sisters friend for tickets (she probably wants me to drive her there too).<br /><br />plus i think his entroducing stuff is prolly impossible to match:/
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|great. I love this singer and enjoy her voice and her story. I highly recommend this CD for you !
B005GG0MIS|5.0|This non fiction book was an eye opener to what transpires after one leaves the presidency<br />and how they are called upon, sometimes secretly to assist the current president. The former<br />presidents make up their own private club.
0312330537|5.0|I love this book so much I have bought it more than 5 times. I have gifted it, lent it and lost it. I think it is best for ages 20 - 25.
B00181JGI2|4.0|I'm a bowler and this movie makes fun of the bowling culture.  Lot of tongue-in-cheek humor.  Loved Sam Elliot's cameos.  Steve Buscemi and John Goodman played the kind of crazy friends I have known.  Loved the plot involving mixed identities and some of the dumb situations the cast members get into.
B007HC3LHS|2.0|She carried us through the book then just ended it with out going more into the relationship after the danger passed!!!
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|My kids loved this movie, watched it over and over.  It was magical and funny and kept the parents interest.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Reading this book has without a doubt opened my eyes to see the world of human behavior differently. I'm grateful to all who worked to compile the research and form the content in a connected and intelligent way. Absolutely recommend this book to everyone!
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|Great movie did not stray away from the comic book. Look forward to the sequal.Action and plot was outstanding. Visual effects were awesome.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|I think it was ok, I can't buy the reel one so I got this one the game is to short if you want people to buy the app make them longer let us get a feel for it before stopping the game and asking us to by it! k! Other then that I liked it. I give it a thumbs up. Good job guy's!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Looking forward to seeing the rest of the series. Good science fiction/fact and great actors.  I especially like the doctor.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game subway surfers is challenging but very fun because i am 12 and this is i little bit like temple run but even more fun.;-D
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I am still reading it.  I am thoroughly enjoying reading this book, again.  Its a book that can be read over and over again.
1932735410|5.0|Very well written book....Author deserves all the appreciation<br />The whole style of presentation is like having one to one session with Author
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE IT SOOOO MUCH AND I just wish wish that they had a enchanted table but it's still awesome
B006LSZECO|3.0|Good book, but the amount of vulgar language distracted from the story.  I usually feel that overuse of words indicates a lack of a range of vocabulary, but in this case, that doesn't seem to be the point.  It just seemed not to be necessary. I would have enjoyed the book without all of it.
B000GGSMB2|5.0|Pacino excels in this movie, De Palma directs.  all actors perform like never before.  everyone is happy, but most die.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I think that this is a really fun game. I play it to pass the time at home and school.
B00190OHD6|3.0|A widow follows a trail of letters from her dead husband, who is trying to help her move on with her life from beyond the grave. My wife was bawling over this movie. I didn't cry - cause I'm too manly - and I thought it got kind of sappy. The portrayal of a widow who can't move on from her husband's death felt real, though. I can totally see myself that way if my wife died. The ending was a nice twist on the romcom genre, and the whole thing felt better than average. Worth seeing.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|The concert was Great. Audio and video was great, really enjoyed the show. its a must for all eagles fan
B009LRE040|5.0|This really closed out the trilogy well. Bane was absolutely captivating on screen, a great follow up to the Joker. There are some plot holes, and not seeing Batman for most of the movie was disappointing, but I still love this movie.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Having been a Harry Bosch since his first appearance I was extremely pleased to see The Black Box published. Michael Connelly certainly continues to deliver the goods, with Bosch continuing to fight the good fight with a determination that does the heart good. Hopefully Harry has a few more good years in him before retirement.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great story.  So glad I found it.  My 12 year old also really liked.  Can't wait to see the movie!
B0007Y89ZM|4.0|Compared to today's bands the Eagles still soar.  It was fun to see and listen to them at this reunion concert.  Still an exceptional group
B00992CF6W|5.0|its the beeeeesssssstttttttt game EVER!!!!! (: and make a updates with pets and breeding and mojang is soooooooooo awesome also make dimomos easy to find and iron and lapisluzy
0811870413|5.0|With this book, many trials, and a folding bread proofer, I finally managed to make an utterly beautiful and delicious loaf of Tartine Bread.
B004WJRF6C|4.0|McCartney remastered.This was his \\"feel out\\" album after the Beatles breakup.A couple great songs, 3 good songs, some instrumentals, and some filler.The 2nd cd in this set is a 1 star listen.His next 2 cds are the breakout Paul McCartney...... support your favorite artists.
1452101248|5.0|I love the flavor of the recipes in this book, in fact I liked it so much I just bought my daughter a copy.  (She says that a friend saw the book, looked at the cover, and said that she was going to make a reservation at Ottolenghi's restaurant for her coming trip to London!)
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|recommend it to all, engaging and though provoking, you will not be dissatisfied. If you can see it in 3d though
B0054JZC6E|5.0|O absalutly love this game !!!!!!!!!!  I especially love the serpent game. It is my favourite app on my kindle!!!
B002DOSBMK|4.0|I was interested in the imaginative underground world filled with stalactites, stalagmites and mushrooms. I actually wanted to live in this world. But Salvatore's writing is so juvenile. He completely takes out any mystery or sense of discovery by constantly telling us everything right up front rather than letting us discover through dialogue and action. I'm not a fan of books that switch between characters' perspectives constantly, especially from three different characters' POVs within the same paragraph.<br /><br />I tried to imagine Salvatore was reading this story to me aloud, and that helped, but I wish the book had been better-written. Do we really need to be told a character laughed or smiled \\"evilly\\"? It's just so juvenile. But still, it's a fun read. I need a break from Salvatore before I try to read any more of his work, though.
B00B69UQEO|4.0|It's a great album that grew on me quickly. Lots of fantastic songs. The last two albums were very good this one's even better.I'd give it more stars but it's hard to top some of the earlier albums
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This film is truly exceptional.  It is also very difficult.  I do not want to ruin the experience for you so I offer a few pieces of advice while watching and nothing more...<br /><br />1.  Keep an open mind.  There are many messages that are not fully revealed until the end.  This is made more difficult because these seemingly separate messages do tie in to a much broader message that is revealed almost simultaneously.<br /><br />2.  The VFX are spectacular but the film is not meant to be a spectacle.  There is meaning to be found in almost every component of the story.<br /><br />3.  When finished, research the story.  Specifically the names of characters and how they are related to actual historical events.<br /><br />4.  Enjoy and suspend disbelief...  This is a carefully nuanced piece of art intended to affect change in the viewer.<br /><br />It is my belief this story is intended to change the world.  Not that it actually will but the message is incredibly broad and idealistic.  Some people may find the message reassuring while others may find it disturbing.  What worries me is that in many ways this is art for artists.  It requires analysis and information beyond what is presented but that is part of it's beauty.
B004GTKP3S|5.0|I really enjoy British series T.V. and this was a very good series.  I enjoyed the characters and the acting.
B005ZUR724|5.0|great m m o very much like W o W. sunny days are nice for grilling out and drinking fine ales.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have chosen this rating because I loved this book I liked every piece and I recommend this book to everyone.
B007FY9ZWI|4.0|love this app except for one thing: I can't make playlists. I can make a playlist but can't put any music in them. In essence I have one really long list and I'm constantly going back n forth getting to specific tunes and having to scroll and scroll and scroll. bummer but gonna keep it til I find something else.
0307740919|5.0|I love all of Toni's novels.  This was touching.  Experiencing what happens to men (paticularly men of color) post any war inspires the highest level of compassion,
B000PFU7OO|4.0|Bought this mostly for one song came just as I expected I liked more than the one song so cool deal.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This a very awesome book I loved it. If you want it you should get it. It will be one of the best things you do. I loved the book. I  going to get the second book of the series. LOVED IT TOTALLY WORTH THE MONEY AWESOME BOOK.
B000GH3CVQ|4.0|I was watchin all kinds of movies from library saw once and liked the quirkiness so I bought that move and sound track and the swell season by glen hansard who starred in once all was as expected.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|Everybody loves &#34;Walking Dead&#34;.  Great production values.  Tremendous acting for SF/horror series.<br />I especially enjoy Glenn and Maggie - a great couple.  Guess the premise got a little tired for me this season.
B000X1Z0BU|4.0|Was weird which I liked having watched this from my local library so I decided to buy it came like it should have.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|This movie is great.  I would warn faithful observers of the book that this adaptation does not stay strictly to the text.  The general events are there but the movie expands upon the other characters rather than stay focused on Bilbo.  The movie also shows events that were only briefly mentioned in the book towards the end as side passages.  The actors are great and the director has taken great care with the movie.  Enjoy.
B000002IJO|5.0|Always liked ratt wanted to get on disc rather than cassette tapes when my bro originally bought so bought this up came great quality.
B0010T0OCY|5.0|The story of a man finding himself trapped in a city with no escape.  Hunted by the police for something he may or may not have done.
B00A9T1HUO|2.0|I have several Josh Groban CDs and was excited to get his new one.  Unfortunately, I am not as fond of it as those in the past.  I have only listened to it a couple times as there are just a couple songs I actually like.  Will go back to his older CDs.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|This game is easy and challenging at the same time! the graphics weren't the best but the gameplay is totally awesome.
B00881VLCE|3.0|Great app. Lots of free puzzles. My only complaint is that sometimes you open up the app and you no longer have the option for 288 pieces even though you were in the middle of a puzzle. Instead you only have options for up to 56 pieces. To fix this, you have to uninstall it and then reinstall it but then you lose any of the puzzles you paid for.  I reloaded the paid for puzzles and was not charged for them, so that was good. But its still a pain.
0385349831|5.0|I have always loved Paulo Coelho's books; they are so concise in a great way, so beautiful but challenging. He is simple but profound and his histories will make you rethink your whole world. Because all of that, I expected \\"Manuscript found in Accra\\" to be great. And it just... is. As other Coelho's books, it takes you to another world and the story surrounds you in a beautiful way. You can't stop reading and you see yourself immersed in a charming but deep history.<br /><br />We live in a very changing world, and \\"Manuscript found in Accra\\" just goes back to the beginning. I really appreciated that while I was reading, and I felt again that magic, like when I was 16 and I read \\"The Alchemist\\". That magic is exactly what makes books great. And this new book makes you think about some of the most basic things of your life and your world. It is original but structured, easy to read and inspiring. As Paulo Coelho usually does, the new book is not very long, but it's precise and intense, and it just gets to the point. Because it's easy to read, I would recommend read it even twice! Some quotes and some sentences are so thoughtful that I would say that the whole book requires re-reading.<br /><br />Indeed, the plot, the quotes, the philosophy behind it... everything makes it just simple but at the same time magnificent. I couldn't stop reading. It was just pure wisdom. Highly recommended.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|I use it at least once per week and it finds lots of items to erase and frees up a lot of space kn my Kindle Fire.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I got this free during a promo. It does what it's supposed to however, I wish it was smoother. But it takes time to make an app &#34;perfect&#34;.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like having the option of random play or winning play.  I usually choose random but have chosen winning when I have had a frustrating day.  NICE GAME.
B0064BCNA4|2.0|Not bad but I got bored quick. Besides, whats the difference between the Pro version and the free version? Were there some ads I missed? Oh well, I got this pro version free during a promo.
B00BUI5GW8|3.0|some of the lyrics are just a little too out there for me, although I think he's a creative genius.
B0058VW36U|4.0|This is a fantastic game for all ages! One sad thing is I lost my progress a few times! I had bought some super-powers earlier, and now I don't have them!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 is an amazing ride from start to finish. There are so many twists and turns. The only problem is Andrea's story arc... She becomes the most unlikeable character on the show by the end of the season which is disappointing.
B009AMANH4|3.0|There was so much hype that I expected more than I got.  Moves slower than I would prefer.  It shows how Lincoln dealt with the Congress but I hoped that it would show how he ran the Civil War, as much as he had the power to run.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Fun little point and click game. Not very difficult, but a good time waster. Graphics are surprisingly good. Voice acting is really cheesy.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show presents a realistic view on a zombie apocalyptic world, by which we may see ours become like so here soon.  Mwahaha!
B000FCKPHG|3.0|Premise of the book is great, that basically anything can be learned. Author uses way too many examples as filler it seems. She even reuses some the the same examples. A few of the examples were quite interesting however, such has how the heads of Tyco, Worldcomm, Chrysler, Enron suffered from the fixed mindset and how other corporations flourished using the growth mindset. I read the first 3 chapters and starting skimming over the rest because the examples got so redundant. Even the last chapter which was supposed to be more practical was half filled with examples. The other half has some useful information though.
B0091REZMW|4.0|it is an ok game for being a free game I have seen better and worstbut cats will soon be peering dogs out their mouths just after eating frogs from the sidewalk
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Simply fantastic, surreal and very real simultaneously!  The reader will read with relish and credibility will be established as immersion in the past and present transpire. A fantastic read!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|What a great book to read.  It's funny,it's sad, it gets your blood boiling at times and then it puts you at peace.  Most of all it puts a smile on your face.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|It was good, the only thing is that I wish the story would had on into more of his thoughts.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|It has beautiful music, and wonderful acting and dancing... it gets inappropriate: sex, drugs, etc. and I wish it didn't do that stuff but its hard to avoid to give a realistic view of musical theater...
B005HSL626|3.0|Have fun with it all the time. you should try it and enjoy putting you pic on it with your family
0393338398|3.0|I felt this would have been handled better if the two threads of the story had been separated.  How and why Billy Beane failed to acheive success in his playing career despite abundant natural talent was discussed but never really gotten to the bottom and I felt this was worth exploring.  Secondly, how the Oakland Athletics were able to get away with identifying and picking up at bargain prices unrecognised talent for more than a season or two was not adequately explained.  If it's such a clearly successful system is everyone now doing it and if not why not?  Also despite gathering such talent for so little outlay the A's have had only limited success overall.  Is this an inherent flaw in the system?
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Awesome for when playing yahztee.............and awesome for otherits as great as your mamathings to.great app great app great app great as my mama and u i would say
0525478817|5.0|A story that, by description, doesn't sound that great (kids, cancer, star-crossed lovers, etc.) but is an engrossing read.  Well written, great characters, little twists and turns, idiosyncratic authorial viewpoint, all adds up to great book.  In lesser hands this could have been a mushy, tugging at the heart-strings tearjerker, and while it does make you question the concept of fairness in life, neither the story nor the characters are allowed to spend too long feeling sorry for themselves.  Though I think they would have a right to.<br /><br />I see this is often described as Young Adult or ChickLit.  Well I don't qualify in either criteria (I'm male, 55) but I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B00AGKHFCA|5.0|I love this cd!  This man is a great singer.  I have all his cd’s so far, keep them coming!
0140143505|4.0|Surprisingly slim volume, but the correspondence reproduced is very enjoyable.  The witty and upfront American gradually breaking down the cool British reserve is a pleasure to read.  I felt an authorial comment on the situation at the time may have added to the experience.  The correspondence covers the years 1949-1969, but little reference is made to happenings in the wider world: e.g. Suez crisis, the assassination of JFK, the Profumo affair, moon landings.  Did they not enquire into each other's experiences of these events, or were they edited out?
0143039431|5.0|Book came much earlier than expected. My son needed it for school and of course had waited until the last minute!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is pretty fun. I think the saddles and stuff are too expensive though but I'm not that far into it yet. it is fun and helps pass time
B0072X2NUS|5.0|Some old school and some new school funky mixes that created chaos bliss you could tell which artist between the two  good job Gentlemen !
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Not the quality I've come to expect from Pixar. Lacks the depth of character. But, still an enjoyable tale, and the animation is beautiful.
B00B69UQEO|1.0|Been a hard core fan from there beginning ...!  After David fought through his addictions Martin discovering country music...They have seemed to have to lost what made them unique !  It was never about synth o it was about there energy !  Martin found some groove with Clark from Erasure recently it was wonderful.  I waited a long time to see what this band would discover through time as I constantly sought what wonderful tones they would create.  Gentlemen Shame on you not meaning Fletcher either if this was your first album you would have made.... You would have never made it this far...  Go back redirect.... This album I could barely listen to the whole entire thing seeking hope.  Honestly it took me 5 hours I could only stomach so much but forced myself to try to be more open !!!!!
B009NPA3MS|4.0|I was not sure that I liked this album at first, especially since one song definitely seems to be a rip-off from Mumford and Sons, but as it turns out, it's pretty good stuff, and that rip-off was all the work of American Idol, which Phillip seems to have taken pains to make sure folks understand.  good work.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|Pretty good young adult novel, though not something that is life changing.  Worth a cheap kindle purchase, but I wouldn't spend a lot on it.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I love this movie  i collect movie and i have most of my gangster movie so this movie is excellent.if you havnt seen this you should
B001C1066E|5.0|I love it! You get what the picture says. It is a handy change purse and am glad I got it.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I know it's free but it a waste of your device's memory. Once you download it all it does when you try to get on it is ,download.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is amazing.  I play the puzzles every day and I love love love it. Your games are amazing. PLEASE make more. thank you.
B004ULEEY8|1.0|This movie was even worse than the B movie Predators. I'm sick of wasting my money and time on sucky movies. The effects were very unimpressive, the dialogue was stupid, the story line was poorly written, and the acting could not make up for the poorly written script. Farscape is my all time favorite. I like The Bourne Identity, and The Island. Misfits online at hulu is very funny. Stargate Atlantis on Blu-ray is cool, so is Smallville, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, Sg-1, and Roswell.
B0053O89WY|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is an amazing show full of great characters! If you are into comics, collecting action figures, or Cosplaying, then this is your show! Plenty of laughs and intellectual quirks to keep you watching!
B00723NWJE|2.0|Little broken heart is just bad.Not the Nora we all know and love.Strange music,lyrics and I was just so disappointed
B0050PYNOY|5.0|I love this movie. I was unsure about it at the theater but once I bought it on bluray I regretted not seeing it at the theater. This is a really hilarious film with plenty of laughs.
B00005YW4H|4.0|I love it.Just right for a relaxing time!Rainy days,scotch,a nice friend and nora's music.It can't possibly get any better than this!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game. I took a trip to New Mexico and used the 18 hour trip playing through it. Great way to pass the time and try to use your brain to figure out the puzzles.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Just like the prop used in the movie. It is not as detailed as the actual movie prop, but it is a great replica.<br />It makes the sound effect at a higher pitch than in the Dr Who series.<br /><br />Overall a good replication product.
B009AVCAJ4|5.0|I was so happy to get this on bluray! I was a little dissapointed that it was not in widescreeen format but this movie is so great I am still left satisfied.
B001LF3YQK|4.0|This case does a great job of keeping wipes wet that don't necessarily get used every day.  Easy to refill & easy to use--although it's not quite one-handed as advertised.  That's not a deal breaker for me as I really just wanted a travel case that would keep my wipes wet & handy.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|This is a truly fun game to play! Two great worlds brought together! Level after level of fun!!! Must buy the ad free version!!!
B000244FDW|5.0|I am a JASNA member and have watched all the versions of P&P.<br />This version is the best because Elizabeth is the sweetest and Darcy is the snootiest of all the Darcys.<br />So well acted, so well cast!
B009B8YZKS|5.0|This was truly great to watch! Having already seen them online, I could not wait to get the bluray version and pop it in for another viewing. Great for any Halo fan!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Amazing book made me laugh and cry at the same time. Beautifully written, will read many more times. Love, Charlie.
B006WZIETG|5.0|I loved the Gremlins films when I was growing up. This was a great sequel. Great to watch now in HD.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I can't put it down!!! I'm addicted... anyone who's ever wanted a horse but couldn't have one will love this game!
B005FMZWD8|5.0|This is another Great watch!  I love the lefty stems and the face is open and large.  The only thing I can actually criticize about the watch, is its band!  The band is coming a part at the buckle, but I am hard on watches.  I hope Invicta makes the watch a 48mm case and uses a different heavier stitched band.<br /><br />GREAT WATCH and LOOKS GOOD!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game is so awesome I want to play every single day!<br />!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!My name is Jacqueline.I am twenty-one years old.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Yahoo is a usable, functional mail program that I have used for many years.  Sometimes the speed is not what it should be, but otherwise I like it.
B00B8ESWAM|3.0|I had a difficult time getting into this movie. It drags quite a bit and I lost focus several times. I would not highly recommend this movie.
B006UKFFE0|1.0|I'm being forced to write a review from my kindle app. If I don't the boom will not let me flip the page to start reading the book. How am I supposed to review the book if I haven't read it yet? Totally stupid.
B00498TQV8|5.0|One of the best movies I have ever seen. The acting is superb and Oscar quality throughout. This is a must see movie.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Very eye opening to see things from the downstairs view for a change.  Love the characters!  Love the storylines!  Great show!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I knew of the awards just did not expect such a good movie.  Lots to debate over after the movie.
B0068LYEHA|3.0|Just did not like and I could not relate to it maybe a generation gap? We read it for book club and no one was crazy about it.
B007MCTTHY|4.0|It's nice to find a puzzle game that's not timed or relies on more dexterity that I usually have on a tablet.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I loved the information on WW1 plus the great story to go with it. I will read the next one Winter of the world too
B005D9MUWY|4.0|My favorite keyboard. I know there a couple of minor things I dislike, but theyare so minor, I cant even remember them right now. Keep up the good work!
B000002MX7|5.0|The Epiphany:  Best of Chaka Khan - Volume 1,  is just that the best of Chaka singing her greatest hits and what we love about Chaka's unique voice.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I watched  Downton via skipping the 2nd season, this. So when I saw it available here, I filled in. Wow, the characters have changed! Developed? Is Lavinia otherworldly? Does Lord Grantham have clay heels? Thomas so wicked. Mrs. O'Brien, I mean Satan, had a pang of guilt on Lady Grantham's sickbed? Who knew integrity and evil were so complicated?!
B0028R3G5O|4.0|i bought this CD for my granddaughter who is turning 9 next month she (for some reason) is very interrested in Ms LAUPER she even did a school project on her so i am sure she will be excited when she gets this.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|As always Josh Groban has done it again! I could listen to his voice all day long.  You won't be disappointed in All That Echoes!
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I wasn't sure with all of the hype of this trilogy that it would really be that good, that and it was clearly written for a younger audience, but The Hunger Games surprisingly sucked me in completely. Yes, there are a lot of deeper societal messages here of how one gets to the point where they are so desensitized as to revel in the murder of kids and what a govenerment will do to maintain control, yet without delving too deep, it is an exciting and nail biting tale. Through sadness and triumph, you applaud the determination of the main characters and it will make you both smile and cry. Definitely worth a read and it moves along at a fairly brisk action packed pace.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|Great movie.  My Grandchildren really liked the movie and I have to admit that I found it entertaining as well.
B00005N6KG|3.0|These headphones were awesome for running- one of the first pairs I've found that actually stay on/ in. They had pretty good sound quality too. But one ear inevitable shorts out after about 6 months (2-4 times per week/40-60mins). It's honestly probably worth it for the price to just replace them, but still frustrating.
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|This is a really cute movie for the young viewer.  My youngest granddaughter really liked the movie and wanted to watch it more than once.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Interesting presentation of historical still classified event with outstanding acting.The timing was AOK and combined with imagination it was attention getting
B006LSZECO|5.0|Every time you think you know where this book is going the rug is pulled out from under you. Hard to put down and worth the read.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This game is very addicting can't stop playing it everyday I play it I got the first leap world and now this one hope they can make leap world3
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun and the upgrade was awesome. When you get 100 eggs you get a awesome prize that's what I herd.
B009C7JS14|3.0|constantly changing, can't keep up with it and they want thirteen more words to review this app after I'm finished.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|Not worth the time to watch, we got half way through and stopped watching. I pitched the movie into the garbage and chalked it up as a loss !!
B0072IVGZG|5.0|A breath of fresh air with an altogether different offering from the Cult.  My favourite band of all time can do no wrong!
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Once you start it is really hard to stop. Hidden objects, clues, mystery to solve what could be better. Lots of fun.
B005UBNKWO|5.0|Bought this processor to update my computer a little bit. It runs great and is incredibly easy to overclock. Overclocked it to 4.6GHZ for for kicks and giggles ran smooth even on stock fan monitored the temp the entire time and it seemed to be just fine for 4 hours. I did however tune it down to 3.8ghz later on just to be on the safe side plus I don't really run programs on my computer that require a lot of cpu power. If you're looking for a processor at a decent price this one is the way to go well worth every penny in my opinion :)
B0025KVLTW|5.0|The replay of the un-seen (by me) 'Tour' reminded me of the great comedic capabilities of 'the Beatles.&#34; Would have loved to to haven been on that bus drive. I saw them in 66 as a teenager. They were still playing their teen phase music, which gets bor-ing night after night. We cried when they quit touring, but they could never have produced their masterpieces from Rubber Soul forward without the hours spent in the studio. &#34;Come on....&#34;
B00AYHKOZU|1.0|*This review is about the shipping package that amazon uses and not the music.*<br /><br />I've been waiting on this new Bowie for the extra few weeks so I could enjoy it on vinyl.  It just arrived and once again, since it is a double album, the cover was destroyed by the shipping package that Amazon uses.  Sure the corners are perfect but the rest of the cover looks like it was folded, smashed and generally beat up.  It gets annoying when almost half of the double or thicker LPs arrive this way.<br /><br />Come on Amazon!  One of the pleasures of vinyl is enjoying the artwork on the cover and interior and is meant to be enjoyed for years in a collection.  It is not a CD or MP3.  It is part of a tactile, analogue collectable experience.<br /><br />I hope the replacement is in better shape.
B0025KVLTM|5.0|I had most of the Beatles canon stolen, along with my pull out cd player. Abbey Road and Let it Be will give me back everything from Rubber Soul in which IMHO is 90% of the Beatles originality. Won't go wrong here; mushrooms still fresh.
B00946ZOT8|5.0|nothing wrong at all. with order.My son loves it. With all the other New Moon toys.and dolls. Couldn't be better.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I enjoyed the complexity of the problems the main character faced every day he was on Mars and his ability to solve them. Everything the main character had to do had the potential to be life threatening as he was on Mars. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys science fiction and solving problems.
B0053O89YM|1.0|As always, we thoroughly enjoyed this latest season on DVD and again, as always, can't wait until the Fourth Season will be on the market.  It's well written with interesting story lines and well-defined characters. You can't figure out in advance what will happen next and that, for me, is a big plus.  So many of today's shows are predictable.  Thanks.
B0018QCXGY|5.0|Bought this as a Christmas gift for my nephew. He has seen partial snippets of the movie on the internet and just had to have it. The movie didn't disappoint his or my expectations. Done in a similar fashion to the Blair Witch Project, but much, much, better. Great story line and special affects. Highly recommended.
B008PZ69RU|3.0|It wasn't as good as I'd expected.  Think I had over-anticipated, expecting something on the level of \\"Traffic\\" or \\"Crash,\\" which it wasn't.  But the acting was good.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|To be honest, I almost didn't read this book. Everyone told me how it was  about bondage, and I am just not into that. Finally though, I gave in and read it. James is such a descriptive author that I couldn't help but to feel what Ana was feeling. I read this book in 24 hours and am now counting down the days until I can buy the next. Be warned dear reader, this book will make you yearn for \\"more\\". I have read many books in my 22 years on this Earth, but Christian Grey is the first fictional character that has ever played a role in my dreams. This book has me twisted in knots and wanting to buy a leather riding crop. Husbands, prepare for a change in your wives... this book will awaken something primal in them that they may not even understand. But I digress. I believe it is moot point by now to say that I simply adored this book. Enjoy readers! This one is unique, challenging, thoughtful, and revealing. Well done E L James. Well done.
B005FISBTO|1.0|I haven't had time to see it as yet but feel assured that it will be as good as all of the previous Dexter seasons.  It's nice to be able to count on something these days.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Decent movie, especially if you like action.  Not great, not bad.  Plot was a bit far-fetched, but then it's sci-fi, right?
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|I was expecting something more i guess. movie is blah special efx are very good. I saw the 3D ver as well. its great
B004FP1WX0|4.0|In the age of Skype, Facetime, Google Hangouts, and $20 HD webcams, the idea that someone could get emotionally attached to someone they've never even conversed with on video seems very naive.  The movie is alright... stop there.  The TV series based on this movie makes you sad for all the subjects involved.
B0001FR3IQ|5.0|This movie is full of scary events and it is full of twists. It is really awesome and I recommend it to anyone who likes to jump (or scream out like I did) while watching scary thrillers.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Too bad many Americans will mistake this for real history.<br /><br />ARGO was a pretty good movie... Never mind that the whole rescue deal was a Canadian effort, not American... and that it wasn't THAT close... and the Shaw the movie said the US &#34;installed&#34; in 1953 had actually been Shaw since 1941... the real movie script wasn't a sci fi... there was no &#34;last minute approval&#34; by Carter, he'd already greenlighted it... there was no chase at the airport, and even if there were it would be highly unlikely the Iranians would be driving AMERICAN MOTORS MATADOR model police cars, and even if that were true they would never have kept up with the airliner on the runway which would have been doing about 185mph to achieve takeoff...<br /><br />But whatever... pretty good movie.
B000068CNX|5.0|I absolutely love this show! It always brightens up my day. It's so sad that it's no longer in production. I recommend this show to anyone who loves to laugh a lot.
B0039UTDFG|5.0|I bought this as a present for my fiance and we both love it. The quality of the picture is unbelievable. This series truly shows how majestic and mysterious our world is. A must have for EVERYONE. Not to mention it is very informative. I tend to be partial to documentaries and this is by far my favorite.
B00005JN4H|5.0|These two should always make movies together. They are absolutely hilarious. I highly recommend this movie to pretty much everyone. It's really good.
B00005N7Z1|5.0|I bought this as a present for my father because who doesn't love Robocop. Honestly, it arrived in perfect condition and worked out of the box. I ended up buying it for myself soon after.
0780631684|5.0|This movie is such a thriller! It is so good!!! I love it so much. I watch it all the time. Made me afraid to get on a plane lol.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is really fun and great. but I think Xhosa and computer is better but updates are coming soon!
B003L20ICE|1.0|This is the most vile movie.  Children who were adopted from a lesbians are trying to discover who their father is.  The father is portrayed as a uncaring, noncommittal guy. When he finally does make a connection with his children and their mother's it twists into a stupid sex scene as one of the lesbian mother's has sex with him ruining the new found relationship he has with his children. It is truly the most disappointing films I've seen to date.

B00B5JBZGS|5.0|I have been a KSE fan since the release of Alive or Just breathing in 2002.Their sound was  welcome after all the Korn and Limp Bizkit of the 90's.My favorite Howard album is As daylight dies and i love the work he did with the band.Jesse in my opinion brings a more gritty, emotional,sound to the band.I appreciate both singers and dont think one was better than the other although Howard has a more dynamic range with his vocals.Jesse seems to have a bit more range since returning.I bought this album as a pre release and received it 4/1/13 and listened to it all day and i must say I think it is outstanding.From the first track to the last track this album rocks...the guitar work is some of the best yet from them.I purchased the special edition from amazon today to add to my cloud player.In my opinion this is a must have release for any killswitch fan.Even if your one of those diehard Howard Jones fans you will appreciate the work done on this album.

1451695195|3.0|I have read a number of books like this one, but what intrigued me about Alexander is his perspective as a medical doctor.  The actual &#34;proof&#34; of heaven is not really the centerpiece of the book; the author's struggle with his physical condition comprises most of the narrative.  That part is interesting, but not the reason that I purchased the book.<br /><br />Couple of issues:  the actual writing could be better; the language is sloppy in parts and sentences not very concise.  I would not blame Alexander but the proofreaders and editors should have ensured a more seamless read.  Also, the descriptions and emotions in the afterlife part of the book are powerful, but provide little that hasn't been covered in other places, such as Sylvia Brown and Shirley Maclaine.  I enjoyed the ride, but when finished I gained no greater understanding of any moral problems today, so while I have more corroboration that I will not evaporate when I die, I am still not awash in insights about daily living.  Very nice message about love, compassion, and search for meaning beyond the self, but if you already realize these conditions of existence then this book will simply provide one more source of inspiration.

B000001EL3|4.0|Some say Destroyer is the best Kiss album. For me, there are better Kiss records out there (Hotter Than Hell, Creatures of The Night, heck even Lick It Up). There's no argument about the great cuts on Destroyer: Detroit Rock City, King Of The Night Time World (co-written with crazyass Kim Fowley),God Of Thunder, Shout It Out Loud, Beth. I just really hate the filler track on this record: Great Expectations, Sweet Pain, Flaming Youth. What was up with those backup singers on Sweet Pain? or the choir singing on Great Expectations? Sorry, some of this stuff producer Bob Ezrin incorporated didn't really gel with my ears (although he used similar embellishments on Lou Reed's Berlin and Pink Floyd's The Wall, to greater effect)

B00004XQ83|3.0|It has some good Bluegrass, but other songs are not worthy of prime listening. Although well made technically, it just shows how great the editing was done for the movie.  Without the movie to watch, the music lacks its raison d'etre.<br />  I bought it primarily for In The Jailhouse Now which became background music in the film after Tim Blake Nelson started it at the political rally.  In the movie you can't hear all the lyrics because it was under the main dialogue.  Its such a catchy tune, I wanted to learn the lyrics in order to tease my friends.<br />  I bought the record for that reason.<br />  I play my Sleepless In Seattle record over and over, enjoying the music on its own without the movie.  Not so with O Brother.<br />  With some fans I may be &#34;In the Jailhouse Now&#34;.  O Brother.

B002QGSYRC|5.0|The best book I have seen explaining the causes behind the strategic failures by the US in the Korean War. The author describes in detail the flawed actions and often petty self absorbed personalities of General MacArthur, Almond, Willoughby and others in McArthur's circle. The author also includes the equally faulty mindset of Mao himself, and the slaughter of Chinese troops that relentless Chinese assaults led to after General Ridgway took over command in Korea, and put the US superiority in artillery and air power to maximum effect. Halberstam discusses the catastrophic mixture of ideology, racism, hero worship of MacArthur, and the creation and suppression of intelligence to fit the MacArthur world view and military/political objectives.  All fully enforced on the often dissenting leaders in the field by incompetent sycophants MacArthur gathered around him at headquarters. Halberstam compares the intelligence failures in the Korean War to the tainted mix of extreme right wing politics, reality ignoring wishful thinking and poor intelligence that got the US into the military fiascoes in the Vietnam and Iraq Wars. This was accompanied by a racist attitude at McArthur HQ towards the fighting capabilities of opposing forces ('Chinese laundrymen' - General Almond) and a flawed belief that the existence of overwhelming US superiority in weapons, absent a viable and sound strategy to use them, guaranteed success.
B000IZ6URY|1.0|The first scene mocks US perception of foreigners and its simplistic bomb-the-problem approach to conflict resolution.  Kinda funny, but that's as good as it gets.  The rest of the movie is just a couple of guys making puppets do and say stupid/disgusting things.
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|I downloaded this the day it was free. I am very grateful to have not spent money on this. The graphics are amazing, which is why this gets at least a 2 star rating instead of 1.

0060555661|3.0|When I wanted to learn about strategy and war, I read Clausewitz and Thucydides.  When I wanted to learn about character and virtue, I read Aristotle.  I had heard that Benjamin Graham was the Grand Puba of sensible retail investing practices, so in line with Clausewitz and Aristotle, I turned to this book.<br /><br />Much of his own writing covers the market from the 1920s through 1971. To be sure much has changed in the marketplace to include the jargon (enough about the railroads, already! Geez.). Readers may therefore find the contents of his writing somewhat off-putting and aged. What I found interesting was that, despite the changing of the times, the psychological aspect of trading (and speculation) are unchanged among many participants. Additionally, Graham was just as cautious of overly-mathematical derivations of a company's value (i.e. math beyond basic algebra) as many are today. I guess even back then \\"Quants\\" were something to be wary of.<br /><br />Though higher math is mercifully de-emphasized in this book, you will have to apply some math to determine value. More importantly, you'll need to get comfortable surfing a company's 10K. An Excellent primer by Merrill Lynch on how to read a financial statement can be found here:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />With that, a few suggestions for prospective buyers:<br />-- Print out a graph of all the bull & bear markets since the 1900s. The book refers to the downturns of the 1960s & 70s often.<br />-- Brush up on some of your accounting terminology -- accounting is more of an art than a science and can make the difference between what appears to be a healty company and one at the end of a plank. Again, use the link above!!!<br />-- If this is your first book on investing, or you're completely new to investing, set your sights on something more introductory. Much of the content is, in my opinion, directed at investors who have some working knowledge and experience in the field. I would recommend, instead, combining Daniel Kahneman's \\"Thinking, Fast and Slow\\" with the \\"Financial Times Guide to Financial Markets\\" before reading this book.<br /><br />A lot of reviews dis Jason Zweig's participation in this book. Frankly, I think his inputs were clutch and they make this book relevant for modern times (with particular emphasis on the dot com bust). I think I may have made more notes on his commentary than on Graham's.<br /><br />Understand that this was last updated in 2006, but the preachings fortell virtually everything that happened in the 08 crash in terms of speculation. There is a later version - 2012, I believe - that is for Kindle. I had read that the graphics weren't that great and since I can't have any portable electronic devices where I work, the 2006 paper edition sufficied.<br /><br />I've also ordered the \\"Financial Times Guide to Making the Right Investment Decisions\\" to round out my education in value investing...more to follow.ing Daniel Kahneman's \\"Thinking, Fast and Slow\\" with the \\"Financial Times Guide to Financial Markets\\" before reading this book.<br /><br />A lot of reviews dis Jason Zweig's participation in this book.

B000P0J024|5.0|This set contains the only 2 Wilburys albums, remastered and packaged together with a dvd that details their history. If you've never enjoyed the Traveling Wilburys, this is the ultimate set. May as well have both of these brilliant albums. And I do believe Harrison was right to say that John Lennon would have been a Wilbury. Every song is good; some are really good and a few are even great. But what can you expect when you have a band that has George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Jeff Lynne, Tom Petty and Roy Orbison in it? This is one of the few supergroup bands that lived up to my expectations.
B00BDZV9M4|5.0|I almost went 4 stars but decided to keep listening to the album before rating. The downfall of the album was the early release of singles....but \\"most\\" of the other songs are lyrical genius as usually. A few songs fail, but all albums have that. I think it is worthy of the purchase, for as my 5 star. On a weezy scale, i would call it a 4 star.
030758836X|2.0|The many twists and turns in this story take the reader through many emotions but I did not care for the book overall.  Both main characters were not very pleasant.  I bought the book for bookclub but did not really like it at all.

0375507256|2.0|Definitely a book that is out there somewhere.  It consists of 5 different stories which somehow tie together loosely over time.  The writing style differs for each story and there is one set in the future which you can barely understand.  I bought the book for bookclub and finished reading it looking for some tie between the stories but many in the club did not finish the book.  Very difficult reading.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Jump on the Downtown Abbey train, you won't be disappointed! The rich storytelling and colorful characters make this series wonderfully addicting. There is heartfelt heart break and laugh out loud humor! I can't get enough!
B004H6G0TI|5.0|I got this as the FAOTD a few days ago, and have been addicted ever since.  I still havent beaten the game, but I think I want to unlock all the planes and this is just anperfect time waster.  I can assure you that this is more than worth the purchase price.<br /><br />Good:<br />*Gameplay is simple enough to jump right in, but deep enough that you don't get bored.<br />*Loads of planes to unlock, and each one plays differently combining one of 7 different weapons with varrying levels of turn, speed, and health.<br />*The mix of enemies on each wave is often challenging, sometimes sending you back to previous levels to unlock a better plane.<br />*Multiplayer (haven't personally tried)<br /><br />Bad:<br />*doesm't look like it would work well on a phone<br />*occasionally the controls lock up, but that might just be my tablet.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Wonderful interpretation, as expected. Rich imagery, panoramically intoxicating, amazing CGI. I was always a big fan of the Hobbit series, even more so than Lord of the Rings. I can't wait for the next 2 movies!

B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I enjoyed this game immensely.  Good story line and the cut outs are informative rather than annoying. Goes quickly but is never tedious. Some of the puzzles were more challenging than others. I liked it.  It's pretty long as well.  The upgrade was 99&cent; Great deal
B001UV4XIS|5.0|While I wasn't a believer in the early years, I now love all the movies.  This one was amazing with the fight scene at the end.  Since they split it up into two movies, I really wish they would have added more from the book ( like hearing the potter watch and updates on their friends) but still love the ending none the less.

Good ending, got to see it in many different perspectives. I still prefer fantasy, but that does not apply to this book. I give this book 5 out of 5!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book. It had lots of twists and turns. The writing style was fantastic too. It was hard to put it down.
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|Ok where do I start, well first the game is very addictive but to buy many things you must first buy medals with real money. Also, this game like so many others freezes your kindle a lot. Many times it will display a message where you can't get to any of the buttons like home and back. You must completely restart your kindle in this case. Going back to purchasing, you also need social points to buy vehicles and a few other things but to get social points you have to send a invite to random people who don't accept it. Also the most expensive men and vehicles die before they even do any thing. This game sucks don't get it.<br /><br />Y<br />I

B006M9NJFG|2.0|ideally you want to carry as much water as you can but full this canteen is very heavy and takes up alot of space.The case it comes in is nice but has a poor design. it works good to carry on your belt but that is about it. I tried to strap it to the outside of my bag and drooped out because the strap sits to low on the case. I had to take the strap off and itch it on the top of the case to allow the canteen to hang and lay flat on the bag. I would only recommend this canteen if you had a big bag with extra room to store it inside.
B001TCHDPS|4.0|Rodriguez is the voice of poor Detroit streets in the 70s. He describes the rawness of the grimy streets and those who frequent the bars and make their living with drugs and flesh poignantly.
B007I2BZIE|4.0|I normally try to avoid the trap so many people fall into concerning their music of choice - it seems far too many people seem to lose interest in music or their favorite bands once they, the listeners have reached their early 20's or so.  At this point, as in the case of a lot of my friends and co-workers, any music past this point is suspect, and they lay back and stay safely in their comfort zones where there is no scary music to have to listen to that they haven't already heard a million times.  Even when they claim classic bands like Rush, ZZTop, KISS or whomever as their favorites, they still won't listen to anything new or buy those groups' new albums.<br />  I have not suffered that fate, and as a musician myself, I refuse to.  I go nuts if I don't have new music mixed in with my older classic stuff.  Rock is an evolving art form, and people who grow stale totally miss its overall point.  Rush is a band that has always been musically challenging.  They always stayed on the heavier end of progressive music in the 1970's, which meant I liked them, because even today bands like Yes, ELP and Genesis bore me to death.  I don't care for much modern prog, either, because it's too much noodling and endless showing off and not near enough song.  As Rush grew though, they wisely adapted to the musical climate without sacrificing their identity, which is amazing when you compare \\"Caress of Steel\\" with the synthesizer heavy music of \\"Signals\\".  I must admit some of their latter day stuff has not caught my attention, and there have been some CD's that I didn't care for, such as \\"Roll The Bones\\".<br />  However, I felt like giving the guys a chance after reading some encouraging stuff about \\"Clockwork Angels\\" and was pleasantly surprised.  It's probably the heaviest thing they've done since \\"Permanent Waves\\", but doesn't sound like that album.  Here, the star is the song and a great production that makes them sound more full than ever before.  Alex Lifeson seems more interested in textural solos this time and impressive washes of sound that are lush and crushing sometimes all at once.  Geddy Lee shows the bass world once again who's boss, with his bass prominent, lower toned and all over the place.  He hasn't sounded this assertive since the days of \\"YYZ\\".  Neil Peart has not lost power over time either, and contributes his usual conceptual storyline, which is a \\"meh\\" to me because I don't pay much attention to lyrics anyway unless it's somebody unusual like Clutch's Neal Fallon.<br />  \\"Clockwork Angels\\" is a work that will grow with time and is strong enough to join their classics like \\"Moving Pictures\\" if FM radio will pull their heads out of their ass and play something new once in a while.  The most interesting and quite beautiful track is the closer \\"The Garden\\", with rich acoustics, some keyboards and a very nice vocal melody from Lee.  Rush has not really recorded a tune quite like this, and it shows them in a songwriting class of their own.  Long time Rush fans should not fear to check out the new album.  It's pretty impressive.rested in textural solos this time and impressive washes of sound that are lush and crushing sometimes all at once.

When I shake the mouse the button in front of the scroll wheel rattles around loosely.<br />2)The mouse seems to have a slight lag very comparable to an infrared mouse. Even at 1000hz (usb3.0 and 2.0).<br />3)The front thumb button is placed to far forward to be effectively used.<br />4)The thumb buttons are all programed to keys on the keyboard which isn't terrible but it is an inconvenience, most mice have their own keys and you can program them in game. This mouse you will have to create profiles for the mouse for each game or just use the same keys and re-arrange your keyboard keys.<br />5)The mouse feet are terrible, they're just cheap thin pieces of teflon plastic but they didn't take the time to round off all the sharp edges so it will catch on your cloth mouse pad (that is if you use one).<br />6)The weight system looks like something someone slapped together and didn't think through thoroughly. It's just a round foam pad about 1/4\\" thick with holes in it to hold cylindrical weights. The door is kind of a pain to open as well. My Pixxo mouse has a cartridge system to hold the weights in.. again it was $26<br />7)Dpi button is below the knuckle of my middle finger making it almost useless for in game. ( I know I can reprogram it )<br />----------------------------<br />Overall I gave this mouse a 2out of 5 star review mostly due to the fact the mouse has lag, the build quality and it doesn't have it's own keys for the thumb buttons.<br /><br />I really did have high hopes but I would game with my Pixxo or my Razer Deathadder over this mouse (my Pixxo over my Deathadder fyi). May be a good mouse to dink around with but it's definitely not meant for gaming where accuracy counts the most ( I play fps mostly).<br /><br />It seems this company cares what people think so maybe they will change things in the future, but as of right now I can't recommend this mouse especially since it will probably only get used my my HTPC.<br />-MikeMike86<br /><br />Edit: They offer a cheaper return shipping if you have an issue, their customer service seems amazing. Once the quality of their product gets better I don't think they'll have much competition with great customer service. Most manufacturers seem to have forgotten what customer service is.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I had heard that the Jack Reacher books were very good.  I agree.  This book grabbed my interest early and maitaine3d it throughout the book.  Will read my in this series.
0547848412|5.0|great book from begining to end bought it for a friend she is enjoying it as well. and will continue to
B0049U4NQO|5.0|Another great book about Alex and his adventures with MI6.  Anthony Horowitz knows how to write spine tingling stories that keep you interested.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Another great novel by Gillian Flynn.<br />While some parts of the book are a little disturbing the whole story is an excellent thriller,that leaves you thinking and guessing about who really is the murderer.<br />It's a must read
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I loved this book! It could have something to do with the fact that wolves are my favorite animal but the writing was fantastic. I have never liked the gushy kind of love stories, but this was just right. It let you know that they were in love, but not to the point where I wanted to skip it. Overall, I loved this book and can't wait to read the next two!
B008133MDK|5.0|It is so nice to have the concept of Sherlock Holmes updates to current times.  This presentation has great personalities, chief of which is Benedict Cumberbatch and his protrayal of Sherlock.  The cast interacts flawlessly and there is a delightful blend of suspense and humor in the scripts.  I only wish there were more than 3 episodes per season...it's just not enough of Sherlock.  BTW, catch Cumberbatch as the villain in the new Star Trek movie.  He's really good.
B00919CI5Q|5.0|Excelente tarjeta de video. Todos los juegos corren perfectamente. Y puedo conectar a la vez mis 2 monitores y mi proyector. Gran producto y excelente marca.

B003B02O14|5.0|Again, this was an excellent read.  He is so good, I just can't wait for the next book to be released.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I think u should be able to choose what events you start on, cause I would've loved to start in Barrel racing or reining or cutting (if these events are even on there)
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham is the best mystery writers.  Once you start reading you just can't put the book down!  Keep on writing, John!
B00BGIC4I6|1.0|this movie stunk not funny at all what a waste dont be fooled the funny parts are in the previews only
B003B02O7I|5.0|Once again John Grisham leaves me wanting more and more.  Once the book was read, I was checking to see if there were any I missed!
B002W5UVSM|5.0|This is an excellent book. Where's the sequel?!! [just kidding]. The cover is deceptive: the bird is not yellow. But I got it on Kindle, so I didn't have to look at the cover much. My favorite bit: the sounds of mother getting ready to go out ...
B004LROUNG|5.0|Again, another outstanding work by John Grisham.  I don't remember which is which because I read them all kindle dover to kindle cover!
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|LikeRunning this game on a Nexus 7. The graphics are amazing.  This version is the best in the temple run series.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|I just finished watching Searching for Sugar Man and am in awe.  What a wonderful documentary about a very beautiful human being.  I'm probably going to have to own this so I can see it again and again.
B0033AGJ5Y|4.0|Good delivery. Would be five stars but has a couple glitches in the movie, like skips but you really don't lose anything.
B00C4QWDYY|2.0|Remember the scene where Carl got shot? Remember when Rick turned that corner on the horse in the city? Remember the CDC, the interstate when the herd came through.....any scene that Shane was in?<br /><br />This is no longer that show. If all they've got is a guy mowing down a crowd with a gun then screw them. Even the Merle situation seemed rushed and contrived.<br /><br />The dynamics that Shane and Dale brought - gone. The interesting path Andrea was on - gone. Now she's a g-stringed girlfriend - oh wait now she's dead too. Merle's great presence and the potential for his character - gone. They brought the cool black guy with the dramatic British theatrical training and the greatest southern accent ever from the first season back just so you could watch him quickly disappear into useless madness and find out that his awesome kid died.<br /><br />All that remains is a lukewarm crowd of people waiting for Rick to give orders - even Daryl - with some moodiness and bitchiness occurring throughout from what's left of the uninteresting group.<br /><br />The governor - the actor totally unconvincing.<br /><br />All my favorite characters are dead - no longer anticipated the next episode. It's a dead show as far as I'm concerned.
B00985E3UG|5.0|I don't eat many processed foods but now I look at milk products and other things and get the chills! How dare the food producers take advantage of people and treat us like pawns instead of valuable customers!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Just like all the other 5 star reviews!<br />I programmed it for my game and I got results! 8000 DPI is already getting way more than you need.<br />It's an amazing mouse.<br />Will buy a mouse again from Anker.<br /><br />Thanks!
B00BI73CVI|1.0|This is musical with only one female singer worthy of the role (Anne Hathaway).  Although trumpeted as being recorded live..... they obviously never understood the inability to sing is not enhanced by a live recording and that bad karaoke less here than on American idol.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman although excellent in so many other roles is completely miscast here while over-acting and terribly over singsonging in most of his all too many musical attempts.<br /><br />What a waste of millions.... and my life.
B00006AFF5|5.0|Hilarious movie and Jim Carey plays the Grinch well. I watch this every year on Christmas Eve. That poor dog goes through a lot
B005SZAEYO|5.0|This show is great and kept me on the edge of my seat up until the last episode.  I fell in love with the characters and the effects used to pull off different scare tactics.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I am not completely finished with the book yet, but it is a good read. I have read the first two books and this just seemed like the next one to read.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|This product, for lack of a better word, BLOWS.  Yeah, you can hear my voice. I'll give you that. But the \\"shhh'ing\\" in the background. The background noise, makes everything about this suck. It is easy to use, and convenient. Just plug in, turn on, clip to your shirt and go. But when they say it seems to good to be true, they are right. The low price and the ease, make it look enticing. Heck, i bought it. But DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.  I recorded an HOUR of video, and really good content is in that video, but honestly it's pretty much wasted because of this s***  microphone.  Unless you put LOUD music over the audio, the hissing in the background is VERY distracting.  Save up, (even though it may take longer) and get a DECENT microphone, thats what i will be doing.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|I bought this movie for my mom for her birthday and she loves it. I personally didn't care to watch this, because I'm not into this sort of thing.
B00000K3CR|5.0|Let me start by saying I've always loved this movie and am still entertained when I watch it. It has so many charming elements you could write a book describing them all. I've seen it a million times, so it seems. Undortunately, when you watch any given movie that much you catch the flaws. Most have already probably been pointed out but there's a glaring one that I think is subtle yet the greatest.<br /><br />Compare Hank's character portrayal to Forrest Gump and you find many similarities. But this man-child in Big isn't borderline 'retarded', he's a 13 year old boy. That said, does Hanks play a convincing 13 year old? When we compare his performance to a real one (his best friend in the movie) it's sad to say Hanks actually acts more like an 8 year old throughout, and what's more is everyone falls for it. It's one thing to offset an ironic childish maneuver or statement with a sly grin or chuckle, it's another to never do so and hence act like a retarded man or eight year old child. Hank's charachter never shows the wit to suggest to other adults that he isn't just being ironic and I don't think any adult would take him seriously the way they took Peter Sellers' Clancy gardener character in the movie 'Being There'. Sorry to point it out.<br /><br />But if you ignore this and focus on the fantasy, well, this movie is a sweet sentimental treat about the child in all of us.
B0091REZMW|3.0|i thought this game was way too long and didn't complete the game because it didn't give me enough points to move on to the next level and I ran out of time to play because I work lots.
B006O6F932|5.0|This is the crown jewel of my daughter's monster high collection. In her opinion, you cannot have the dolls and not have the school playset. She loves it.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|My boyfriend and I just love this movie. It was so hilarious and had a great story line to it.
1439102813|4.0|I enjoyed this book alot.  I enjoy reading and getting a better understanding about those with memory loss.  A good read for anyone who has any experience with folks with memory loss or you are just beginning the journey with someone.
B0098VXBIA|5.0|the actors and actresses are great. I love the story line and love watching this movie over and over again. In fact, I own it now.
B005HED11Y|5.0|It is nice that it is remastered.<br />In HD&#60; I like the clarity and it brings out the characters better.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love this!! I can organize things & it's a lot of fun to find new things to try & decorate my apartment or future house with.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|EL PRODUCTO CUMPLIA CON TODAS LAS CARACTERISTICAS DISPUESTAS, QUEDE MUY SATISFECHO CON MI COMPRA, EXCELENTE PRODUCTO. EL ENVIO FUE RAPIDO Y SIN NIGUN CONTRATIEMPO.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|I'm afraid that the show seems to be running out of gas.  The last two or three episodes have left me kind of &#34;meh&#34;.  Andreas' behavior in the finale is inexplicable.  In a life or death situation, she wasted an incredible amount of time and then lost by seconds.  Moreover, the season finale, which ought to have been a cliffhanger, left me with an odd sense of closure.  If the series ended here, it would feel complete.  The immediate crisis was resolved and we've all come to grips with the idea that the world is not going  to get better.  &#34;We're here and it's now.  The sooner you get hold of that, the better you'll sleep.&#34;  (Probably misquoting Charlton Heston from POTA)  That's the feeling I had, watching the season capper.  If this were the series finale, I could live with it, which is absurd; any well written show leaves the viewer craving more.  Frank Darabont  is sorely missed.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  Take time to enjoy the simple things in life. I recommend it for a quick read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|.Always keeps me entertained. Not hard at all. Good way to spend your free time.<br /><br />It is good for learning how to take care of a horse. Great for people who adore horses.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|The game does not fit on the screen, so I have to constantly slide the picture over to play it.
B009GEDP26|5.0|I have really enjoyed this show since the beginning.  I did not however, enjoy the direction the previous season (season 4) took.  There were some good episodes, but I felt like the tone of the show had changed to much.<br />Season 5 however, has been excellent.  Its funny, smart and the characters feel like a family again.
0312430000|4.0|This book really makes you think about the power of a simple checklist. I have begun to look at where checklist can help me in my life
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This has quickly jumped to the top of my favorite games list. Fun and flexible. Going under water was worth the wait.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|One for ourselves and 2 as gifts. I never head back from my brother in law so I don't know how they enjoyed it. But my family really enjoyed it and so did we. We are now hooked on this series!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|The children enjoyed hours and hours of fun with these products. Keeps them out of my way when doing things thanks Diamond Dash

B007BVMVDU|5.0|I'm a big fan of the books and this series doesn't disappoint. They stayed pretty true to the story line. Really looking forward to Season 2.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|This is the usual match three or more of the same items while trying to unlock some squares. But this takes more thought than usual and is not a quick game to play. There are three modes of play, so you can play a single game or take more time in tournament play.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|R.R. Martin should go down as one of the greatest story tellers in modern times. I am just a bit worried that when I have read his final book in this series,will I find another book to keep me riveted??
B000TENK4K|5.0|If you love this band like I do, then you will love this new album. Plenty of toe tapping electronic beats with the band`s usual vocal manipulations. No one does it like them!
B004L9MFM2|5.0|I find it impossible to comprehend how R.R. Martin can continue weaving such a intricate tale with such masterly effect.
B002Q7JYPC|4.0|I'm a lifetime fan of the Eagles.  Been listening to them for 40+ years.  This album will add to my collection.  Glad to have it!
B004GJXQ20|5.0|R.R. Martin I salute you. This book is a work of art to be savoured like a great vintage wine.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I love this interpretation of Les Mis.  I know there are people grumbling about the singing and I understand better voices could have been chosen.  But in the end, it's a Hollywood production so you have to expect that there are limited choices for actors.  This production was still enjoyable to watch as long as you're not too critical of the singing.
B004P1JEXE|5.0|I just cannot get over what a great author R.R.Martin is. He is truly gifted and a godsend to us mortals.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This was a fun,mindless read. And I mean that as a compliment. Good 1-2 day beach book, not classic early Grisham, but a good read.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Really enjoyed this one. Gillian Flynn's style is easily digestible, exciting @ times & I love her pace. Looking forward to reading &#34;Sharp Objects&#34; next.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|All seasons of Gossip Girl have been very enjoyable and addictive. Season six does not disappoint and has a wonderful ending. Sure hated to see it end though.
0385344228|1.0|This book has no redeeming qualities.  The plot is a downer.  The story is unbelievable.  The ending is disgusting.  The writing is amateurish. Don't waste your time.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I have no interest in fantasy or sci-fi....at all.  But desperate for a good read I gave this book a shot, completely convinced I wouldn't make it through the first chapter.  Just a few pages in, it grabbed my attention and didn't let go for 400 pages!!  It was a delight to read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved this Season, love this show, and I love that I can watch it on Amazon. If anyone is looking for a good show, this is it!!!
B00BGIC4I6|3.0|This movie is really funny, but it's also really long. Definitely worth the watch but it kind of drags on.
B00001QEE7|5.0|came in perfect condition, its a great movie and the kids love it so its a win win for all
072325804X|5.0|A beautiful large edition of all the great stories of Beatrix Potter, lovely paintings on every page. I am so glad I purchased it!
B0053TMP24|5.0|Five star big time I love Rick riordan books just read it and you will like it just like me
B00466HN6S|5.0|cute, witty, sweet, holiday family fun!  Great story and it has James Marsden in it.  It's perfect.  Wildly entertaining for both our children and us too!
B006L9B6TI|5.0|If you are a big fan of &#34;the secret&#34; and learned the concept of law of attraction but still don't know what to do, this is the book which shows you what to do.
B00AR3WD8W|5.0|If you are a Elvis fan and you like concert cds, this is a must. Beautiful package. Great quality. I have listened to this cd since I got it. It is great.
B003ZMF26W|3.0|The good:<br />The mouse feels very good, have a good weight and is ergonomic.<br />Have a lot of configurable buttons, and those are very easy to access.<br />The software included is easy to configure.<br />The mouse look really nice, the red color looks pretty good, and the flame is nice.<br /><br />The bad:<br />The pictures in the website shows a wireless mouse, also when you search for wireless gaming mouse, this is one of the first displayed.<br />But surprise!!! This is NOT WIRELESS.<br />In the description of the product isn't indicated that its wireless, however, the pictures are tricky.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this i have two horses and the game always functions when i open it.If you dont have this app and you are reacing this you have to have to hzve to get this app
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I bought this for my husband for Easter.  It arrived in time, and we watched it last night.  Expedient service as well.
B004SDSSFY|1.0|totally and thoroughly disgusted. what i consider one of the most basic functions of excel (the only reason i wanted this supposed fully functioning app),&#34; pull down lists&#34; is not currently available on this app. The functions it does have, and there seem to be many, don't seem to work properly without some decoder for the proper syntax to use. I just took an online training session for excel just so I could make spread sheets for this specific purpose and yet I have not been able make one single formula work properly. I tried many different formulas thinking that by figuring them out I would find a way make the app usable for my purpose with absolutely no success. I consider Dataviz' advertising to be totally fraudulent and will never try to use anything associated with them again. If you want to view spreadsheets on an android I suppose the free app is fine but I can make notations on the notepad on my phone much easier and quicker. One star is too much
B007ZXK08C|3.0|I found it disjointed and I did not like the theme. While I like thrillers this one did not keep me engaged.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I love the material in this show. The acting is good and  I would recommend it to others. Keep them coming.
B00BI73CVI|4.0|I like musicals but this was more of an opera.  Art was terrific.  Real voice of persons doing the singing was raw and real!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's fixed!it's finally working properly! I was sad when it wadent working properly and now it's working properly!Thanks people who made this!
B002ZG994U|5.0|Loved the A-Team when it was on television.  This is a great movie with lots of action & humor.  Really a fun movie to watch!
B006HGXGWU|5.0|Take Shelter is a film for our times.It gives you the sense of impending doom that come from economic crises, climate change,the loss of our formerly secure way of life,the storm that is prophesied to come, It's about the loss of everything that matters to middle class Americans: their jobs, their homes, their friends, their families, their sanity. Curtis,is a man whose dreams tell him what is happening,they auger a disaster about to happen.He is slowly going mad,there's evidence he has inherited his mother's mental illness,paranoid schizophrenia.He has delusions and hallucinations of end-of-days rain,tornados,strange clouds of birds,assaults,abductions,flying furniture.\\"Is anyone seeing this?\\"he asks stopping on the side of the road before a huge electrical storm.The question resonates with the crises of money and morale today.<br /><br />He can't communicate with his wife.He is fearful and protective of his deaf daughter.He is an upper blue-collar working man who works in gravel.He's practical,taciturn,withdrawn,strong yet vulnerable.Family and its protection is everything.Survival.The portents of stormy apocalypse are the projections of an unsettled mind.From the outside his friend Dewar says:\\" You got it good\\".But the film views Curtis from inside-dismantling his home,banishing the dog,alienating friends,taking out a high risk loan to extend the family's storm shelter,abusing his job and sacked for misconduct.It's only after an overdose and a seizure that he tells his wife about the dreams. When a minor storm hits, the town's air raid sirens go off and the family wisely flees to the storm shelter. Inside the bunker, when the storm has passed,Samantha forces Curtis first to take off his gas mask and then open the shelter himself. I think Samantha telling Curtis, \\"We love you very much,\\" followed by Curtis opening the shelter and being confronted by the open, non-stormy sky is very powerful and very telling. Curtis thinks the storm is still raging, but once he opens it, he's forced to confront reality.<br /><br />The whole film is a metaphor,including the ending still being in the dream,only his family through empathy are included in its disclosure.The performances are superb,with Shannon's diffident,furrow-browed,tight-wound, freighted with dread-enigmatic,sympathetic and infuriating.Jessica Chastain portrayal has warmth,strength, vulnerability,conveying the horror of watching her husband's deterioration,the possible destruction of theirlives, yet tries to understand to help her life partner.Curtis rages at friends and neighbours at a supper about their ill-preparedness for the coming storm.Baldly shot on DV with some crisply stylised visual effects.It deals with ordinary life under pressure,with the realities as well as the surrealities of the world.The methodical,paced inevitability of a slow-burn film giving a distress signal from a civilization gone awry.A modern Noah for our out-of -joint times.Compelling.
B000HWZ5WE|1.0|The cd in this package was not an original. It was a very bad copy which will not play in any cd player. Very frustrating!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Fantastic writer - felt everything they were feeling - great twist!  I will definitely see what else he has written.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|It's just wasn't what I expected.  It was more of the same thing in the first book.  Was not impressed.
0394818237|5.0|This book will teach your children the basics of plumbing, mechanics, farming, and electricity.  If you have a child that loves to know how things work, this is a great book for them.<br /><br />I remember when I read this book when I was a little kid.  The images of pipes running here and there, various machines working, and people going about on their daily task.  I would sit with this book for hours as the images and diagrams completely mesmerized me.  Now that I am an adult, I pick this book up again and am amazed to find that even grown-ups can learn something from this book.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book and have purchased several as gifts.  This is the type of book that your children will remember for the rest of their lives.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|excelente producto, me trae gratos recuerdos, muy buena calidad de dvd, lo compraria de nuevo para regalarlo, lo recomiendo a todos.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is amazing but I or everyone needs an update to find diamonds easier and to have worldwide multiplayer
B00004RFFI|5.0|excelente producto, me trae gratos recuerdos, muy buena calidad de dvd, lo compraria de nuevo para regalarlo, lo recomiendo a todos.
B001KX50BK|5.0|come on. do I need to write a review. its Pretty woman. a classic to say the least. I must have to any collection
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|At the age of 46, I've finally read this staple.  I'm amazed at how little the MGM classic movie varies from Baum's original text.  THE VERBAGE MAY seem a bit stale or stilted today, but still a necessary read at some point in your life.  Enjoy.
B00A85EMVK|5.0|Movie is awesome and the high definition and 3D makes it even more awesome.  cant wait to watch it again
B004Z2TUGE|1.0|Okay, I don't like to write negative reviews, but I have to be honest.  This was painful to watch.  The plot is an interesting one but the performances just so poor.  I hate to say that but it's the truth.  This is the reason it was so painful for me to watch.  There was just no connection not just from character to character but from actor to their own character.  It felt empty to me and that's always a sad thing because I love movies and I watch them to escape a little bit.  There was nothing to escape into with this movie.  Let's just say that I'm glad I rented it and did not buy it.
B002JVWR4U|5.0|Season 2 was just as good as season 1.  Joss Whedon is a creative genius and one day the networks will see that and let him have a show that lasts long than a season or two
B001N4L38K|4.0|The story is a good one, the writing is good, the scenery beautiful, many performances are truly great.  Not a big fan of Brad Pitt. I find his performance in this film lacking.  He keeps pulling me out of the story/world.  Other than that I would highly recommend it for all the other qualities listed.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This is just an amazing game. I  love how lifelike the animals are and the dinosaurs are amazing . You should totally get this game.
B00499QUK2|5.0|I love this show.  It's a modern adaptation of Sherlock Holmes stories.  I've read them all so I'm familiar with them and the adaptations are great!  The performances are fantastic, and there are genuine connections being made here.  This is a great show and I hope to see them going for a long time.  The only complaint I have is that there are only three episodes per season.  If you're a Sherlock Holmes fan this is definitely worth a watch.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Loved it loved it loved it!!!! What an absolutly fantastic idea ! I adored the characters, the story, the HEAT!!! Makes me relive Castle's first seasons. More, more!!
B008133MDK|5.0|The first season was amazing, the second one even more so.  It just keeps getting better, so far.  I love the actors, they're all so amazingly talented and have put a lot of effort into their work, though watching them they make it look easy and seamless.  Great show.  May they keep going for many years to come.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|I had originally bought the breakfast club then found out later I got to watch it instantly on my amazon account as well for free. Well I love this movie so there's really nothing to complain about watching your favorite movie for free while waiting for it to be delivered!
B00406TRU4|5.0|I love this show.  I'm a big fan of the Arthur/Merlin story.  However, I am picky about what I will or won't watch.  This show is good.  It's fun, though not historically accurate.  The writers even say as much.  Which is fine.  It's still good.  Colin Morgan is a great Merlin. His sensitivity and vulnerability are really a beautiful thing to experience.  Many great performances here.  Sad the series has ended.  I would highly recommend.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Excellent purchase, I am very satisfied with this purchas and it came in excellent condition.  I can't wait for Season 2.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show and this season proved to be another winner.  I would highly recommend you rent the series and see for yourself.  Then you'll probaby wish to own it.  I highly recommend it.  The storylines are great, the writing is good, the performances excellent.
B0000BVME4|5.0|This album sounds so good, great vinyl addition....like hot maple syrup on pancakes! I can listen to A and B without even realizing I turned the record over. Mesmerizing.
B001NLL8LA|4.0|I always enjoy the Reacher novels.  I thought this one was a little more gory than the others.  It did keep my attention, which is a big requirement for me.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|A good, unusual story with great visual effects! Very family-oriented. Highly recommended. Terrific for mom, dad and all the kids!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I don't think this book is for the faint of heart. It was so sad and happy at the same time. I know that is confusing...you just have to read for yourself.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Well researched book and well written and presented in a way that seemed like the real Steve Jobs no holds barred.
B000I8COBW|4.0|Don't watch this movie if you don't enjoy some campiness. Some sweet one-liners and cheesy laughs that Bruce Campbell pulls off so well in this Cult flick.
B00APPMB9I|4.0|I liked this film, I had to watch it twice before I decided whether I did or not.  Hard subject to deal with. Bradley Cooper acted well in it, liked his gruffy look!
098555780X|4.0|Good photos and step by step instructions. There are no techniques on how to use buckles or shackles with these, so the bracelet &#34;hasp&#34; is all paracord and works really well.
B009329ZF2|4.0|Alot like Tranformers in a way.  The movie really is nothing like the game everyone said it was.  I think it was a story all in it self.  Very action packed.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|WOW!!!! I thoroughly enjoyed this game, it was the best mystery game I've played so far, and it was really challenging and it took me a long time to finish. I loved everything about it and it was kinda scary at some parts, would highly recommend this to someday who's looking for a game they can play all day.
B001FD5KJM|5.0|Movie that all ages watch and have enjoyed.  I love the action.  I'm glad I bought this one and #2.  Heard that a third wason its way.  Can't wait to watch that one also.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|I loved this game the day I got it! It's unique and very addicting. this game lets unleash your creativity and have fun at the same time. I love to make their hair look crazy and funn!
B0095P341S|5.0|What can you say about Ironman.  I love the action and drama and adventure that Stark brings to the movie. Just as good as the first, if not better.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|The guide is professionally done. I like especially the way in which one can 'jump' from section to section with minimal effort, and the images inserted as extra aides. Would have liked to have seen a little more detail  here and there.
B0094KT8PK|5.0|This is a movie that is now on the favorite list.  I can watch this over and over.  The scene in the woods with Betty White and Sandra makes me laugh everytime.
B003Y5H556|3.0|The movie SHOULD have come with its slip cover like it said it would. Other than that the movie was in very good condition..no scratches  on the disk itself but the case had a few scratches and indents but that's not a huge deal. All in all it was an ok purchase.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|If you like Temple Run and Temple Run 2 you definitely will like this one.  It is a game that is hard to stop playing.
B003E8P9G0|4.0|This was a great book, definitely worth reading if you enjoy Rick's writing and interpretation of classical mythology! Can't wait to read the next ones!
B0068THAGY|5.0|I really enjoyed this film.  I watch it all the time.  I feel it can be watched by any age except for the tiny little ones.  But I enjoyed it and I'm a grandma
B003O86FMW|4.0|Hard to compete with book one, and it does not. But it provides an essential next step in the story.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|MAN THIS MOVIE IS EPIC! AFTER READING THE BOOK, I KNEW I HAD TO SEE IT. IT DID NOT LET ME DOWN!
1576754227|4.0|Good book, may want to look into other Tracy books.  Very easy read and makes good sense to the lay person and professional
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|great acting. never was aware that the slavery question was settled before the end of the civil war and that had a settlement between the states had been reached first, the slavery question may never had been addressed. also, interesting that many northern states, ct and nj, were not enamored with passage of the abolition of slavery.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|SwiftKey is the best keyboard app I've tried. It learns how you form sentences and predicts your words. This review was written using less than half the letters you are seeing.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|Talk about effortless grill lighting!  This little guy lights up like a rocket.  I was very impressed with the ease of use, especially because I'd never used a chimney before this one.  This has really simplified my grilling experience and I'd recommend it to anyone who has difficulty getting their coals lit.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I think this show is awsome.  I hope they never cancel.  Jemma is my favorite in SOL and Tara.  Bye
B00APUYWYA|2.0|The script wasn't great. It referenced the Breakfast Club, a much better movie, multiple times which made me wish I was watching that movie instead.<br /><br />I enjoy a lot of the actors involved (Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson) and I'd like to see more of Adam Devine because he's got great energy, but this movie was just not good.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|this is a good app if youhave some time to play it.  the first time I played it I spent a half an hour playing.  the music adds to the relaxation!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game had me hooked in the first few seconds of playing it. It flows well and is user friendly. I was impressed with the graphics. Definitely worth paying for the full version.
B000YRY8BG|5.0|Typically excellent British scripting and acting, with people who have become household names in the years following this production.  Taut, suspenseful and intelligent, it never stales.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|I Love Tinkerbell Movies, can not wait for the 4th tink movie. Tinkerbell is my favorite Fairy from Disney. Hope there will be more tink movies
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I was reluctant to even start watching this at first as I tend to stay away from sc fi/horror/zombie themed movies, but, begrudgingly, I began watching based on many friends' reconciliations.  I'm glad I did, I'm hooked.  While each episode seems to be essentially the same story line, I am on the edge of my seat each episode, and then can't wait to start the next.
B000I8HIR2|4.0|Followed the story line of the game....awesome! The special effects were great and it kept you clinging to the edge of your seat.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|Recommend for Christians and just about anyone from West Texas. Provides several tools for de-fearing yourself from the tribulation and allowing one's self to break through the brainwashing fundamentalism rampant in them there parts.
B000005JFX|5.0|I highly recommend &#34;Do I love you&#34; by Aztec Camera as a wedding song.  This is a great compilation of music that you would have never heard before.  I was happy to find it.  I had it many decades ago and lost it.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I rented this movie for my son and he loved it. I didn't have to worry about him leaving the room and me wasting my money on the rental.
B00AKOB7CG|2.0|does not load on to my device and when installing they say there is an error in loading(i have a kindle fire)DO NOT GET THIS APP
B000006RHR|5.0|No need to keep talking about it. Save your time reading this and just go listen to this state-of-the-art album. One of the best from Iron Maiden, for sure!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I liked to play this game, it is fun to play.  I did recommend this game to my friends, and they did like it very much.<br />This is the best Angry Birds game, and I Play it all the time.
B0002E5O9G|1.0|This is hailed to be the best recording of les mis its not in my opinion. I wish I could have tried it before I bought it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The game was very appealing to the eye and the horse reacted to you just like a real horse would.
0756404746|1.0|This book has no moral framework. The main character indiscriminately kills good (and evil) creatures to suit his own ends. I would like to discover the true name of  the main character and end his murderous rampage forever. Maybe a word of permanent muteness would do?<br /><br />Description is good. Character development is a cesspool but logical. Use of weapons is somewhat creative. Overall, a waste of a good eight dollars.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|it was a little deep . all about politics. I would have liked to see more of the war. more history
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|This movie is great for Tolkien fans, although the sales of this movie match Return of the King showing most people thought it was just as good. The director mixed things up a little bit, but only to improve the conflict thread throughout to movie. The acting is very good, and seeing the dwarves interact only added to Tolkien's masterpiece in my opinion.
B008KOTNVA|4.0|Solid kit. Each piece handled well and looks like it will hold up to standard use. If you abuse it, it might not last. No Craftsmen quality tools here, but very decent for the price.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked the way it was written, each character telling their side of the story.  It was interesting to see a female character that was so thorough, strong, and malicious!  I was truly surprised by the depth of her deception and the workings of her mind.  The ending struck me in that I expected her husband to continue to fight until the end, but she was always way ahead of his game.  This story was imbued with excitement from its inception to the very end.
1932100660|5.0|If you care in the least about your health. Read this. If you care about your families health read this.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the series! Couldn't believe it was over but all good things must come to an end and this book was in my opinion one of the best ending I have read. The character after war is not herself anymore because all she has lived through but in time she does find some form of happiness. I believe in life that is all a soldier can truly hope for and find.
B008602KQI|5.0|I am watching it right now for the second time. It's a great film. Would highly recommend it to everyone.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|I love the new spin on the game makes it feel like a more exciting adventure I enjoy the balloon ride as well as the new enemies...
B009FZFONO|5.0|This show represents many things that I dislike about modern TV.  It is gory, gross and violent.  If you describe it to me I would never watch it. I don't like the horror genre. Previous to this I did not know that sub-catagories of Zombies even existed (shuffler and rager. These are shufflers). I did not read the comics and/or graphic novels. I am now not anymore motivated to read the comics/ and or graphic novel.<br /><br />All that said, I love this show. I find this story telling extremely compelling. It is a study of the human will to survive and how we cope with the decisions we make, and how the stress of constant survival effects our species. It about human resilience and it is well done.  If you make it past the gratuitous violence. (I find looking down and to the right effective but come up with your own strategy) you will be rewarded with a great guilty pleasure
B00B7FXYJG|1.0|The way the film tried to poison young minds by spoofing our 40th president was disgusting.  When did Warner Brothers and DC get so political.  First, Superman renounces his US citizenship, now attacking Ronald Reagan?  Careful DC/Warner Bros. , this road you're on could cost you.
B007REV4YI|4.0|This is the first of the James Bond movies that I have purchased and I was pretty surprised at how much I enjoyed the movie.  I would recommend this movie to everyone.
B00BI73CVI|1.0|Horrible singing.  Was expecting SOME signing, but not every word.<br /><br />This review is written by someone who loves musicals and all of the actors in the movie. I was excited to view it considering all of the reviews and awards it has earned. I was more surprised at how much I disliked the musical movie.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Very addictive and detailed. Been playing for about 8 hours and just can't get enough. And it's free so why not? Nothing to lose
B004K58GSO|5.0|Legendary gunslinger Cole Thornton (John Wayne) is back in the town of El Dorado, called in by shady rancher Bart Jason (Ed Asner) to settle a few things with the McDonald family. Thornton’s old friend, sheriff J.P. Harrah (Robert Mitchum) stops to pay his old buddy a visit, informing him that the whole arrangement isn’t kosher, and that it would inevitably pit them against each other. Wisely, Thornton passes the job, but still manages to receive a crippling, wounded by a headstrong member of the McDonald family (played the beautiful Michele Carey) in the process.<br />Some months later, Thornton meets up with a young greenhorn called Mississippi (James Caan) who is out to settle a debt with a scar-faced scoundrel by the name of McLeod. Smoothing things out as best he can before the shit really hits the fan, Thornton learns that McLeod has filled the post he himself left behind. Worse still, our aging hero discovers that his old pal Harrah has since become an inveterate alcoholic, and that he would be no match against McLeod and his men. And so, Thornton and Mississippi head back to El Dorado to sober Harrah up (leading to one of the funniest moments in film) and to take on the bad guys. Arthur Hunnicutt turns in a memorable performance as Harrah’s ornery horn-tooting deputy Bull and Charlene Holt is on hand as the platonic love interest for both of the old cowboys.<br />Say hello to a brilliant breakout performance by young James Caan as Alan Bourdillion “Mississippi” Traherne, and the great Christopher George as the sinister McLeod.<br />  The new High-Def 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen presentation has never looked better, with very little debris to distract the viewer whatsoever and a color schematic that is well-balanced.<br /> As I watch Wayne, Mitchum, Caan, and Hunnicutt now sneaking down the dark city streets, I can’t help but say to myself, “Yes, this is good. Damn good.”
1594746168|4.0|This is a very strange book, both to experience and to attempt to review.  The first half is a biography of a fictional character and the second half is the subject of the biography's \\"greatest work.\\"  The story of Dr. Spencer Black is dark, gothic, and fits squarely into 1800s medicine.  His father was a Resurrectionist, someone who dug up dead bodies for medical study.  Spencer was pulled into it at a young age.  He eventually went on to a career in medicine himself and was considered something of a prodigy until things went horribly askew.  Seems the resurrectionist past was always under the surface and he starts believing that humans were descended from mythological creatures such as harpies, minotaurs, and mermaids.  So, Dr. Black and his family join the travelling shows to peddle his ideas after he is shunned from the medical community.  It all ends, somewhat unsurprisingly, tragically.  The second half of the book consists of detailed drawings of Spencer Black's ideas.  It is titled \\"The Codex Extinct Animalia.\\"  The pictures are well done and interesting, but seem more for browsing than close study unless one is really into the base structures of mythological creatures.<br /><br />Because of the level of detail in the drawings, and the number of them, I find myself unsure of the exact audience for the book.  The first part of the book is an entertaining, though dark and somewhat disturbing, account of someone who's interest mythological creatures extends beyond simply reading about them to actually trying to reconstruct them.  Still, it is oddly factual in its telling of Black's life and occasionally makes awkward transitions as if the author was unsure how to introduce a certain topic and then get on to the next item.  As for the second half, well, it's great for browsing.  Beyond that, though, it lacks a sense of total fascination.  And, because I feel it needs mentioning, the book is actually well designed outside of the thoroughly modern font choice.  The end papers and layout, particularly in the second half, give the book and older slightly more authentic feel.<br /><br />Great idea, but the execution was a bit lacking in the end, and it's hard to say exactly why.  However, The Resurrectionist certainly has the unique factor working for it.  I'd say it's best for people who like flawed characters, are interested in the time period, and don't mind a bit of gory description.  This is definitely not a book for the comfortable.e end papers and layout, particularly in the second half, give the book and older slightly more authentic feel.<br /><br />Great idea, but the execution was a bit lacking in the end, and it's hard to say exactly why.

B006M4RN3U|5.0|Loved the entire album! I would definatly reccommend this to anyone who is into this new up and coming band - one of my new favs!
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|this makes you notice the fine lines of the puzzle.  love puzzles  you will love this.  another time taker. beware!
B0081X8AE6|4.0|Really nice songwriting. Some of the performances were a little sloppy for my taste, the drums and some of the vocals in particular. The songs are memorable and are worth multiple listens. I only wish the whole record was more like the first track...
B0012CMNGY|5.0|this is truly one of the best albums of songs for the memories and the voice and songs that will live forever.  Carly Simon a great sound
B00006GO9Q|5.0|I can't seem to get enough of this era of Miles. I first fell in love with Kind of Blue years ago. It was a while before I found another record of his that resonated with me like that, which was Bitches Brew. In a Silent Way is another must have. I love the sensitively humble statements.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Brave is a beautifully done animated film. The whole of it kind of reminded me of the little mermaid meets beauty and the beast. I don't know if anyone else ever notices that movies for the same company tend bring in elements from old films into the new ones. I feel like this is what happened. I watched Brave and I felt little again. My favorite film from Disney being The Sword in the Stone and Brave really brought me back to that old time feel. It was full of old magic and challenging fights.<br />I watched this with my older sister first and then again at a summer camp I was teaching at. All of my little kids  loved it. They got a kick of naked old men and were into a world where magic is real. I actually taught a lesson on it afterwards because I got so many questions about it. I was happy that I could bring magic and belief to my kids. A lot of them ended drawing many magical dreams of going off on adventures and meeting naked Scottish men hehehe
B0030V0PEW|4.0|The simplicity of a checklist was something I didn't think if trying in my own line of work, but the author gave some compelling reasons to give it a go. Glad he tackled this and looking forward to tailoring it to my own ideas for team improvement.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Nastiest book ever....I read it because everyone was talking about it.  Can't believe how filthy it is!  Who needs smut?
B00005JSGK|5.0|I must have gone to the movies in around 1961/62 to see this amazing show.  And I also have a 45rpm vinyl record of Baby Elephant Walk, my first record.
B002ZG977Y|5.0|A friend of mine went to my house with this movie to show us.  I never seen it before but when it's started I like it a lot, I love the epic movies like this, it is very interesting learn a little bit more about the greek gods.

B00AC8ZA3M|5.0|I have been a fan of the Halo story and the players since the beginnings of this saga. The take on Forward Unto Dawn is that it is a great story line and direction for the story to go in. The original stuff always had political undertones and this story rides that undercurrent in a totally new way using a unique point of view. All I can say is we need more...MUCH MUCH more. Don't let it end here..........
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I absolutely love this series and would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys drama, love and suspense.  It is fantastic.
B00004THAY|5.0|The &#34;King of Blues&#34; is just that, the &#34;King of Blues&#34;.  This is a treasure to have in our collection for home use, travelling, and just sitting out on the Deck.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I absolutely love this series and would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys drama, love and suspense.  It is fantastic.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I had a great time watching this movie with my 12-year-old son. He asked a lot of questions and understood the reasoning behind the narrator's decision. Great thought-provoking film for the entire family!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I had heard so much about this series, then one day saw Amazon Prime members got the episodes for free!  I watched two seasons in about a week and a half.  I had to pay for the third season episodes ($14.99 for 9 episodes.)  It is an addicting, great show!  Very rarely is there bad language and because of the era in which it is set, very minimal inappropriate content.
B007JWC8ZC|5.0|I have been a movie fan since I was a kid and a Kubrick fan since I saw Spartacus ( and I know how he felt about it )! I  saw this  when it was first released and many times since then. As with all Kubrick movies it just continues to get better with age and it's layers continue to reveal more with each viewing,like many of Hitchcock's pictures. Let me also add that I am a Viet-Nam era USMC vet. Despite those things that are not accurate this movie captures the very essence of all that it portrays with a sense that is almost unmatched in \\"war\\" pictures. Anyone who has endured Marine Corps boot camp will not hesitate to tell you how real that section of this film is. It's R rating of course is well deserved, but these marines remind me of myself and a lot of young men I knew so many years ago. \\"Paint It Black\\" and \\"Mickey Mouse Club\\" indeed!

B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This show just keeps getting better and better!!! If your buying season 2 then obviously you have seen season 1and know what I'm talking about. I'm  buying this just to refresh my memory on all the drama of season 2, and to get my fix between new episodes during the week. Do yourself a favor and buy this and season 1, this show never gets old and you will watch it over and over again!!!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Can't have the new episodes or seasons fast enough!  This is an intense thriller of a show that leaves you wanting more-- every time!

B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book was amazing and you get to see the Roman gods as well. You get to know what it's like being a half-blood from different Greek Gods. It was action packed. I recommend this book to anyone who read the Percy Jackson series.
B007I1Q4W2|2.0|This was a very low budget movie and it was hard to watch to the end, I love zombie movies but this was not one of them, don't think I will watch it again, even if the cable goes out.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|My students and I had a class come and talk to us about GMO food and ever since I have been doing research on it. I have been watching more of what we by and eat. I do hope to have a GMO free house but for now we have to slowly work our way there. I loved this movie and it helped open my eyes more. I am glad we have people out there try to make a difference and let us people know about whats going on in the Kitchen. I am going to show this movie to anyone who want to know about what they are eating.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|This was a wonderful movie, I watched it 5 times and it never gets old, its a good looking movie, the acting is great, but I kinda get tired of the tuff black chick, thats the only bad part but its the new format to the team. Oh well.
1400069742|4.0|Lynne Olson's THOSE ANGRY DAYS: ROOSEVELT, LINDBERGH, AND AMERICA'S FIGHT OVER WORLD WAR II, 1939-1941 is a well written, instructive probing of biographical and psychological elements at work within a few dozen principal actors in the run-up to America's several declarations of war on the Axis in December 1941.<br /><br />It is also a needlessly confusing book, beginning with its two-page table of contents. Listed therein are introduction, 28 chapters, acknowledgments, notes, bibliography and index. With the sole exception of Ch. 28 \\"Aftermath,\\" each numbered chapter is titled by an epigraph, a quotation from a passage within the chapter in question. I invite you to do a little mental experiment. Look at that table of contents pretending that you do not know either the title or detailed contents of the book being reviewed. Would you be able to figure out what the book is about?<br /><br />Here are some selected Chapter epigraphs:<br /><br />1. \\"A MODERN GALAHAD\\"<br /><br />3.  \\"WHERE IS MY WORLD?\\"<br /><br />Here are the only chapter titles that give strong hints as to book's content:<br /><br />5. \\"THIS WAR HAS COME HOME TO ME\\"<br /><br />9. \\"IS THIS WAR OUR CONCERN?\\"<br /><br />15. \\"THE YANKS ARE NOT COMING\\"<br /><br />21. \\"DER FUEHRER THANKS YOU FOR YOUR LOYALTY\\"<br /><br />25. \\"HE WAS NOT GOING TO LEAD THE COUNTRY INTO WAR.\\"<br /><br />What do these titles tell us? Somewhere there is a war (5). Some group notices that war (9). Some Americans are not coming to that war. Perhaps Northerners will stop invading the South in the American Civil War. Perhaps we are talking about the 1898 war with Spain. Or World War I. Or World War II. The plot may not be thickening but the fog certainly is!(15). Aha, Adolph Hitler is grateful to some one. Literally? Figuratively? To one of his victorious generals? To whom? (21) A national leader is against leading his nation into war: Emperor Hirohito? King George? Benito Mussolini? Franklin Delano Roosevelt? (25).<br /><br />This table of contents, to me, is the weakest element in an otherwise sound, defensible tour of a largely Anglo-American horizon a few years before America's declared formal entry into World War II. Little is said of Mussolini, not a whole lot more of Tojo's Japan. Focus is on Nazi Germany, on jaunty, brave Great Britain and on the slumbering USA.<br /><br />Gifted author and researcher Lynne Olson creates a defensible framework around personalities and events of this time of national decision avoiding and of decision making. Many a person with a special interest in this time of isolationism, war fever, horrors in Europe and much more will miss some favorite characters. In my case that is the very redoubtable group of Americans keen to get the USA into full or partial membership in the League of Nations, enthusiasts for the Kellogg-Briand anti-war treaty, activists for peace through collective security --  such as U.S. Representative Sol Bloom, Barnard College's Dean Virginia Gildersleeve, future Nobel Peace nominee Professor James T. Shotwell and Clark M. Eichelberger (mentioned in passing by Lynne Olson).<br /><br />But that is nit-picking. THOSE ANGRY DAYS is a huge, sprawling, very good book. There is something in it for every one: AMERICA FIRST and its advocacy of peace through a re-armed USA, the US army, navy, air force and Congress. And there is Olson's clever if at times clumsy juxtaposition of two very unequal players in the game of war/no war: Franklin D. Roosevelt, about to run in 1940 for an unprecedented third term in the White House and his foe, the intrepid young hero of the 1927 first non-stop solo flight across the Atlantic, Charles Lindbergh. Talk about asymmetrical warfare: the powerful President against a mere sometime Army Air Corps Colonel!<br /><br />Leaving other leading personalities of various countries aside: what stays with a reader about FDR and Lindbergh?<br /><br />Roosevelt, the man who created the New Deal led with confidence from the front of his troops. But the later politics-battered FDR whom Churchill wanted to bring America into World War II on Britain's side was not to be stampeded. He seemed to fear public opinion about war as he had not regarding the New Deal. He read the polls. And in 1941 two months before Pearl Harbor, two-thirds of polled Americans preferred staying out of war to defeating Germany. In late October 1941 Americans were 74 to 13 percent against war with Japan (Pat Buchanan). Was it so wrong of FDR to wait for Hitler to declare war on the USA? Lincoln had waited for the firing on Fort Sumter. McKinley had goaded Spain into declaring war in 1898. In the treaty of Versailles the victorious Allied and Associated Powers had forced Germany to accept sole responsibility for causing World War I. There is bankable moral power in appearing to be the innocent victim.<br /><br />As for Charles Lindbergh in THOSE ANGRY DAYS: he comes across as far less human than his gifted writer wife Anne Morrow. He remained far too long \\"detached\\" from emotional thinking in balancing Germany's overwhelming military might against its atrocities. He was not a foreign policy expert or deep thinker. But once he made up his mind, nothing, it seemed, would make him change it. And after World War II he secretly fathered children by three different German women, two of them sisters. Yet FDR feared this man on issues of war or peace as he feared no other.<br /><br />The book's title is not bad, excerpted from a line by historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.: \\"Though historians have dealt with the policy issues, justice has not been done to the searing personal impact of those angry days\\" Lynne Olson displays mastery of the \\"searing personal\\" dimension of three very angry years in pre-War America.<br /><br />-OOO-
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This is one of the best Marvel movies yet, and I have them all, so this is a must if you love marvel comics. just like in the comic hawkeye and the wichare the weakest links on the team, but they pull their weight. In the next movie I'd like to see a stronger avengers. Dr. Strange would be a great addition and spyder man, we can only hope huh ?!?!?

B007REV4T8|5.0|Daniel Creig, is not my idea of James Bond as in all things, everthing changes, so I must look at Mr. Craig as something different, kinda as a imposter. He is not as cool and calm as Mr. Conery the true James Bond. Craig, is somthing else, he wild and very violent, but he loves his job and his country. The movie tries to keep the Bond story alive, having a black money penny was a major upgrade, some fans may not beleive that but it was a nice move. I enjoyed the movie, but Im a Bond fan anyway. Its a must have for your bond collection. Enjoy !!!

B0012GMYI2|5.0|Coming off of a few decent but overall unsuccessful, and, thus, overlooked albums, Germany's Accept finally took the world by storm in 1983 with their breakthrough release, \\"Restless & Wild.\\" An important precursor to the thrash, speed, and power metal genres, it is easy to listen to this record and tell where bands like Metallica (who would go on to debut with \\"Kill `Em All\\" later the same year), Megadeth, and Kreator got their start. After all, these ten songs and forty-three minutes are chock-full of simple, brutal riffs, fiery, blood-pumping tempos, and impassioned vocals. It all makes for a relentless, fun, and exhilarating roller-coaster of an album. So buckle up.<br /><br />\\"Fast As A Shark\\" proves to be a very appropriate title for the set-opener, as it almost plays like full-on thrash metal, and if nothing else, then at least blistering speed metal, what with its whiplash-inducing tempos, and ripping, buzzsaw riffage. It does have a few leanings toward power metal, though, as evidenced by its high-pitched, properly-sung clean vocals, and bubbly, beautiful-sounding, epically winding melodic guitar solo. Then, after that, it is on to the heavy, hooky, Iron Maiden vs. Judas Priest gallop of the subsequent title song. The tune is a true thudder, and has a rhythmic, thumping drum beat, and really memorable and lung-stretching vocal patterns (including a call-and-response-esque refrain). Another excellent melodic solo comes blazing through the mix, here, too. \\"Ahead Of The Pack,\\" then, sounds similarly like a precursor to Iron Maiden, as it is a really fun and memorable song with inventive, galloping speed metal guitar hooks, good, muscular bass lines, and trade-off solo section (where the guitarists each rip out one blistering, wildly shredding solo).<br /><br />But \\"Shake Your Heads\\" takes on a decisively more mid-tempo and melodic approach, playing like a decent (and sufficiently enjoyable), if aged and a bit sluggish-sounding party anthem that would not raise too many eyebrows if one were to say it sounds like a \\"British Steel\\"-era Judas Priest outtake. It is complete with another catchy, concert-ready chorus, and two more excellent melodic solos. \\"Neon Nights,\\" then, is also heavily influenced by the almighty Priest. It boasts a ambient, docile acoustic intro, fantastical lyrics, nice guitar harmonies and melodical soloing, and a rhythmic, toe-tappable beat. Then add an epically soaring, beautifully-sung chorus to the mix, and the end result of this laid-back, fun-loving mid-tempo jam is stellar and really infectious. \\"Get Ready\\" is another terrifically catchy and rhythmic tune laced with strong hooks and two more totally ripping, screaming, back-to-back solos.<br /><br />The album then opts for a decisively heavier change of pace with the next two tracks. \\"Demon's Night\\" is a heavy, forceful, rock-hard riff-ola with a plethora of chunky, crunchy, headbangable, briskly chug and churning riffs that nearly verge on speed metal territory. Really deft and thumping drum fills (including a noteworthy drum intro), a soaring, harmonic guitar solo, and vocals and lyrics that would make Rob Halford cry are also all apart of this song's bag of tricks. And \\"Flash Rockin' Man\\" continues on \\"Demon's Night\\"'s same path, as a lean, mean, frills-free, straightforwardly riff-oriented hard rock-inflected power metaller with heavy riffing, solid, flowing bass work, energetic tempo'ing, heavy rhythms, and a couple of piercing, screaming solos. It all makes for an anthem that I would be darned if you don't groove along to.<br /><br />\\"Don't Go Stealing My Soul Away\\" is another borderline-danceable number with a steady, deeply-grooving rhythm anchored by heavy, driving bass lines. It all comes together to form a melodic yet simultaneously heavy and hard rockin' cut, and one that is iced with some more especially Halford-worthy falsetto singing. And the album closes in fitting fashion with another feel-good hard rocker in \\"Princess Of The Dawn,\\" which is filled with good, memorable, and even hummable guitar licks that are familiar without ever becoming stale or boring. This closer, which possesses a distinct AC-DC-meets-Van Halen vibe, also adopts one final round of excellent, epically soaring solos.<br /><br />This record might not have been as wildly commercially successful as its follow-up, 1984's \\"Balls To The Wall,\\" but it is right up there with that album in terms of quality. It is a true hard rock/traditional heavy metal classic, and an important milestone on both of those sub-genres' timelines. You absolutely cannot go wrong with \\"Restless & Wild.\\"n,\\" which is filled with good, memorable, and even hummable guitar licks that are familiar without ever becoming stale or boring.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|My son went to the movie and said that I had to see it.  For him to see a chick flick is one thing and for him to like it is another.  I love Nicholas Sparks books.
B008NW1M4K|2.0|Die Idee dahinter ist nicht schlecht aber die Durchf&uuml;hrung ist unbefriedigend.<br />Die Erz&auml;hlung war humorvoll je doch nicht zum auslachen. Obwohl die Geschichte satirisch gemeint ist wird das enorme Nazi Verbrechen irgendwie trivialisiert.
B004XWLN20|4.0|Tom Welling was fabulous. I never saw Smallville when it was on prime time TV. I was hooked after seeing a couple of episodes on TNT. Not to mension...He is the sexiest man in Hollywood!!!<br />This disc set was very tastefully done. It even came with a news paper from the Daily Planet. All the discs were clean and no scratches. It was new but I have received DVD's scratched. All and All I was very happy with my Smallville Series.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Daniel Day Lewis most definitely deserved the Best Actor's Award for Lincoln.  He was amazing and did not disappoint as always.

076421120X|5.0|What struck me first was the clarity and depth of these devotional readings and, yes, I was surprised by that.  I severely underestimated her ability and maturity in this area.  So for those who don't like her brand of music, give this author a chance.  It really is that good and I genuinely look forward to the time I read these devotionals.  Each day's reading is concise, thoughtful, thought provoking, and the entrance to a real time of worship and prayer.  This will become the new standard for devotional writers of today.  At least, I hope so.<br /><br />The readings are divided into monthly themes.  Faithful, Solid Rock, Holy One are a few examples of the themes. They are introduced with lyrics from hymns, and the graphics used to highlight them added to the appeal of this book.  Most of the devotionals have been written by the author, but you will find some that are classics from other authors too, like Bounds, a Kempis, Newton, Crosby, Wesley, and Watts.<br /><br />Any nits against this?  None.  The presentation is well done, easy to read which is important to the progressive lens generation, and attractive.  The work is reverent, relevant, and stays focused toward the title.  I do recommend this book without any reservation to anyone.<br /><br />There are some other products (music and video) associated with this book available that I have not seen.  Please see the reviews for them on the web.<br /><br />This book was provided by Bethany House Publishers in return for this review.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Even though I am not a big fan of Adam Sandler I loved this movie and think he was a great voice for Drac! Its really a very cute movie!
B009UWYFFK|4.0|Fun family movie. Inventive character design and a well pushed 2d animation style done in 3d. I wish they highlighted a few more monsters, but there are many to check out passing through the backgrounds.

B007SYWFRM|2.0|FUN ;sim; style game but developers clearly want you to spend real bucks to support game play growth. The ratio of Game cost of expansion to growth credits payout is insufficient for casual play.<br /><br />$$ You will pay big bucks to actually play this free game.  $$
B006H5120E|1.0|didn't work in my dvd player or any other dvd player i tried i was not impressed at all  :(
B00BHMF578|5.0|For a show based on real events, this one was excellent.  I don't want to give too much away, but suffice it to say that the performances by all the stars were highly entertaining and the plot was engaging.  Although I'm certain it was dramatized at points, particularly regarding specific dialog, the movie also does a good job of following the events being portrayed.

B003UBTX6S|5.0|I am so very much enjoying this series, it has filled my time with a fun book to read. I do enjoy the excitement it brings me
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This is a quick moving book, narrated by two voices. Must of the characters are well developed, and evolve as the book proceeds. Although some parts of the novel feel forced, for the most part it is a very believable work of historical fiction. Set in a period of time that is painful, but also shows the true courage one needed to survive.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|This book is the follow up toSomething Borrowed.  It was good, too, but this one was better.  This one deserves a six stars rating!
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|I'm not really that far into the game but so far it seems interesting.  The only thing I have to complain about so far is the length of time it took to download the game.  It literally took me about 6 hours!
B005LAIIHG|4.0|LIFE OF PI is visually stunning.  I observed tigers at close quarters for years as a volunteer at a preserve for big cats.  I was completely fooled by the CGI in the creation of \\"Richard Parker,\\" although I began to catch on when the tiger did things it was difficult for me imagine a tiger doing, like climbing into a boat or catching and eating a live rat flung at it.  In terms of the story, these moves seemed possible, given the extreme circumstances the tiger was in.  I just wasn't sure of a real tiger, a Hollywood working animal, being successfully trained to do these things.<br /><br />The action at heart is an old-fashioned adventure tale of survival at sea with an unusual twist, told more with humor than desperation.  It strives to present the story as a spiritual one, but like the journalist (an off-putting performance by Rafe Spall.  Why would a stranger open up to this blank, boring boob?) I was underwhelmed by that aspect.  The \\"inspirational\\" thrust felt scrambled and overreaching, and once Pi is at sea, secondary.  I had only a tenuous idea by the end what all this was supposed to have to do with God.  Part of the problem may have been the sound in the all-important reveal Pi makes to the insurance investigators at the end.  Suraj Sharma's accent was too thick and his speech too fast for me to catch a lot of what he said.  Was it me, or was the sound poorly handled in this scene?  I've seen the film three times--still can't get it all.<br /><br />But I got the tiger.  Who hasn't felt at times trapped, abandoned, marooned, to face a proverbial tiger of some sort in our own lives completely on our own?  When Pi attributes his survival to Richard Parker for keeping him alert and active, the emotional truth resonated.  Overcoming a challenge to survival has been the making of many a man or woman.<br /><br />The greatness of this film lies not in its metaphors but in its awesome visual sweep.  I've never seen water look so crystal clear on screen.  Its appearance alone carries mystical implications.  The movie needs to be seen on the big screen to get its full meaning, for on the big screen the water not only thrills but illuminates.  Note that in the editorial review above, Kathleen Fennessey compares the brutal storm in this movie to TITANIC.  Puzzling, as there is no \\"horrific\\" storm in TITANIC.  Perhaps she meant to compare it to THE PERFECT STORM--whatever--but she's got her storms, and her movies, scrambled.  The water effects in LIFE OF PI range from being as shimmering and evocative as a Monet painting, to being a terrifying cataclysm.  TITANIC has nothing to compare with it.  In LIFE OF PI, the water is alive, one of the primary characters, and makes the movie come alive.
B000VMBXNA|5.0|Extraordinarily humanizing of the Queen of England and lovely insight into why we read and how it changes us.  Lovely.

B005K17RU0|4.0|AccuWeather allows me to check the current temperature without a lot o hassle.  It also allows me to check the temperatures of other cities where friends and family live.  The previous site showed the current local temperature in the bottom right hand corner of my screen without needing to click on the arrow.  I would recommend this product to my friends and family
B00000IGGA|5.0|I'm totally loving Tom's skills in writing the most interesting material I've heard in a long time.  Early in his career I had the pleasure of buying him a drink at the bar in Georgetown (D.C.) when he appeared there at the BackDoor.  A more unpretentious and down to earth soul I have never met in the music business. The music presented here has a lot of professional appeal and his backup musicians are firstrate.  Be prepared for traditional Tom and some unconventional soundscapes as well. I first considered buying this album after hearing Beth perform Hold On in an episode of  The Walking Dead this season.  But I soon realized that the many other songs where just as memorable and fun. Listen to Philipina Boxspring Hog as an example.<br /> Thanks Tom for a tremendously entertaining album of songs and I hope my pony also knows the way home.
0307352153|5.0|I loved this book!  I have always considered myself to be introverted and loved the way that Cain explored this topic. She explains how our society values extroverted people over introverted ones. However introverted people have these amazing qualities that often make them better leaders and businessmen.  I felt like this book really spoke to me and helped me to understand a little more of myself!
B009E3EYS8|4.0|It's a lot like being at that concert and experiencing the band firsthand. The sound is superb. I was always of the opinion that Jimmy Page couldn't recreate the sounds of multi-track studio guitar leads live. After all you only have ten fingers and at the most twelve strings available live. That being said Jimmy does a tremendous job.  Robert Plant's voice had it's limitations but even at his age he sounds a lot better than Roger Daltrey does today. Jason Bonham does a great job of backing the band and the interaction between John Paul Jones and Jason are a pleasure to behold. A tremendous historical moment captured beautifully on film.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Sometimes you need the feel of a book. The smell of the paper, the texture of the page, and the illustrations. I've always loved Holmes, and a digital copy would miss out on so much of the whole experience. Buy the book and experience Mr. Doyle's work the way he intended.

B0089EHWQE|5.0|I would highly recommend this book. It was very well written and had you engrossed in the characters lives from the beginning. It will make you laugh, cry, hope, think and dream. All loose ends were tied up and did not leave you with questions  like some books do.

B0087GJ8KM|5.0|I have been in marketing for 25 years, and so much of what Daniel Pink had to say wasn't a surprise to me - but the way he said it was. He articulated things I've often felt or thought about the notions of sales and marketing, and he makes them actionable.  Good read, you will have take aways that will you begin to use each day, every day.

B002RI98BA|4.0|Loved the book. The story about one of the greatest statesman in the world along with his colleagues and how they changed history was a wonderful read. That Obama is president now of the same country shows how much tho world has moved forward.

1400052181|5.0|This book is well written and easy to read. It provides great information on a rarely discussed topic: oppression of the individual for the greater good of the society. It is perfect for someone looking for discussion material in a course on research ethics.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|I can't understand why anyone would be offended by this movie.<br />It is a phenomenal story of two people, who become friends in the unlikely circumstances.  The young black man, enters a world of opulence and a world of challenge.  Not only must he be available 24 hours a day for a quadriplegic but he must learn to deal with crisis that he has never been challenged with before.  His good nature proves to be a tonic to a lonely man, trapped and isolated by his injuries.  Together, they embrace those things that are still fun - skydiving, racing cars and love all at the encouragement of the helper.  They are truly kindred spirits.<br />This is the kind of movie you sigh because it ended.  You cry a little for the fact that these two seemly unlike people have bonded in friendship that is found once maybe twice in a lifetime if you are lucky.<br />See it.  Buy it.  See it again when you need a lift.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Much easier to use, I can cross referance scripture faster. I can also compare 2 versions of the bible when I am unable to discover what it is I'm supposed to see in the verse.

B009ZM76J2|5.0|Very touching movie. This movie shows how our the third world country is still corrupt n should be investigate. This should b stop.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Very  descriptive.  Makes you feel as if you are in the planes and going along on a mission.  It really seems to acquaint you with the various flight crews.  Makes you jubilant on a mission that went right and deeply saddened at the ones that didn't, especially the death and wounding of &#34;your&#34; crew members and friends.
B007HC3LHS|3.0|This was a great thriller but the rest of it (supporting character development, love interest, etc.) left some to be desired.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Great quality blu ray.  Shows the true beauty of the set and costumes of the show.  Can't wait for season 4.
1451695195|2.0|This book begins with an outline of Dr. Eben Alexander's college and professional life.  He talks about how much he wanted to fly as a little boy, and how he then parachuted during college. Then his E-coli bacterial meningitis attack and 7 day coma, during which he experiences his NDE.<br /><br />Something didn't feel right to me throughout the rest of the book.  I'm fully open to the possibility of NDEs, but the book really lacks description of what it meant to him, personally.  Also, his behavior afterwards seemed off.  When a complete non-believer goes from zero to a hundred spiritually, the \\"experience\\" of God brings one to life in a way they never imagined. He skips over that phase completely so the reader doesn't have an opportunity to gain insight into how this experience really changed him or his relationships with others.  Or what message he took from it, other than he is loved.<br /><br />I struggled with the message he received from his sister that he could do nothing wrong. The prhase \\"new age\\" kept rolling around in my mind.<br /><br />I don't deny he experienced his NDE, but I don't believe his book can possibly offer proof it was an experience of the divine.<br /><br />I'm actually surprised a neurosurgeon would write a book like this marketed in popular culture. Certainly not the type of genre that would make an impact in his colleague's field. And the fact Dr. Alexander is touring at $375 a seat, suggests he is targeting the masses, not his scientific colleagues as he purports. I wouldn't recommend this book to read about an NDE, I think there are better ones out there.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Very addictive game.  Be sure to use your diamonds and coins wisely.  Levels add more rooms and be sure to use your gadgets to scare off Snatchins.

B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love all the options this alarm clock comes with. It is so nice... I love the different sound options to choose from; especially the option to use music that I have stored on my Kindle Fire HD. I would also like to express how nice the blue display is... I just love this app!
B00AVIQTB0|4.0|Angel Heart is one of those oldies that you don’t mind watching every five years or so(not any sooner than that). This movie still delivers when Mickey Rourke used to deliver, which he does not anymore(a shame). I think it was this movie that got him going in Hollywood as a lead. Working with a legend like DeNiro does not hurt at all. DeNiro gave the movie a seriousness that other wise it would not have enjoyed having.

B009JBWOU0|5.0|i love christopher nolan from his memento days.  and with him at the helm of the trilogy, i was definitely in for a magnificent storytelling.  highly recommended not only for the batfans!
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Excellent story, great message and I also liked the literary stile; however, the ending was disappointing and anticlimactic.<br />good for light reading
B0000029DD|5.0|I bought this for the &#34;Hallelujah&#34;, but really grew to like the rest of the CD. Buckley sings for himself, like there is no audience.  Pure music.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Even though the disks were outta place they weren't held to together properly the set still works fine and everything else looks brand new even thought I bought it used! Love the sons and I cannot wait till season 5 comes out on the Dvd box set.
B002CAWNEM|5.0|My daughter loves this movie.  She spent her own money to order this movie so she can watch it when ever she wants and as many times as she wants.
B004NJC0B6|5.0|Some people prefer AC/DC with Bon Scott, some people prefer Brian Johnson.  I like both.  BUT, I definitely prefer Bon, and THIS dvd shows so much of WHY.  Recorded live in Paris in 1979 on their \\"Highway to Hell\\" tour (their last with Bon), \\"Let There Be Rock\\" captures AC/DC on stage as they were making their worldwide breathrough.  It would of course be sadly cut short with the death of Bon early the next year, which makes this concert even more of a \\"thank God the cameras were rolling\\" moment and must-have document for any AC/DC fan.<br /><br />The audio is superb and the picture quality is also excellent.  The content itself is beyond question:  vintage AC/DC tearing through classic after classic where they've always been best, on stage.  Would have been nice to hear \\"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\\" which is not included here, but the rest is so good that it's hard to complain.<br /><br />Live Wire<br />Shot Down In Flames<br />Hell Ain't A Bad Place To Be<br />Sin City<br />Walk All Over You<br />Bad Boy Boogie<br />The Jack<br />Highway To Hell<br />Girl's Got Rhythm<br />High Voltage<br />Whole Lotta Rosie<br />Rocker<br />Let There Be Rock<br /><br />The off-stage and interview segments don't add a lot, but do give a glimpse into the personalities of the band (my favorite is when drummer Phil Rudd is asked if he writes music, only to reply that John Lennon and Paul McCartney are \\"safe\\").  The interview bits are a small enough part of the DVD that they don't get in the way either. The live footage is the attraction here and it delivers.<br /><br />Total running time is listed as 98 minutes and there are no bonus features, but... that's AC/DC.  They're not going to throw a lot of extra garbage at you.  Just the boys in the band doing what they do.  That should be enough and it is!<br /><br />I have a few DVD titles from AC/DC featuring both Bon Scott and his replacement Brian Johnson, but if I had to pick one and only one to keep, THIS IS IT!  High voltage rock and roll indeed...
B000SGRONM|2.0|Some of the chapters seem to be written by somebody else. The story lines, vocabulary, just don't fit. That being said, 6-8black men, and Jesus shaves are true Sedaris...witty and wanting more.
B008D30K7E|5.0|the thing to remember is that the author ties everything together neatly, three quarters way through, (except for the elephant). Why he has an elephnat in the story is beyond me. but I forgive him, due to the fact that the book itself is a very enjoyable read. maybe in the next edition he will drop the Elephant and put in a pot bellied pig, or a boa constictor, anything other than the elephant.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|No complaints. Fast. Stock fan is good enough unless overclocking.  Runs all my games at max settings.  easy to install. Just love it.
B007HU4FZ2|5.0|Gibson truly brings the Gospels to life in one of the most important films of our generation. This is a masterpiece.
B0070NSPCU|4.0|This was a great story, great characters, and backfill of a world.  Decent battle scenes painted.  I can't add any value to some good reviews here.  Only reason not a five star rating was editing needed (but not as bad as I have seen with others.)  Worthy of the five bucks paid.  But now what to read that won't be a disappointment following such a good storyteller?
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is a great book written by a great American who is no longer with us.<br />R.I.P CPO Chris Kyle.<br />Thank you doesn't begin to cover all you have done for America or the wounded warriors you have helped after you got out.
6305075379|5.0|Got exactly what was described, and arrived in less than 3 days. Excellent customer service! Movie was a classic ahead of it's time.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is addictive.  So glad to watch Seasons 1 and 2 on Amazon Prime before the next season begins.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Excellent version. I love the audio.  Also, I love the access to a variety of biblical text within YouVersion bible.
0316548189|5.0|This man is one of the greatest role-models of our time and his book is a fascinating unforgettable un-put-down-able read. Here's the history you didn't get in school. Strength, courage, wisdom, ethics - this man has them like no other politician today.
B000GL1BHO|5.0|My niece thinks this is the ghost from scooby doo and plays with it all the time.  It deserves more respect than that but it brings her joy nonetheless.
B003EYVXTQ|2.0|Sorry, but just found the movie boring. A poorly developed story line.  Nothing interesting. Slow paced. Jennifer Lawrence is a great actress, but the film didn't do her talents justice. I don't recommend.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|The  flashlight is  very bright and works very well. It is also very compatible with the kindle fire. You won't be wasting your time.
B00AEFYX4U|3.0|Okay movie. I had higher hopes as Johnny Depp was &#34;the voice of Rango&#34;. Was likeable, but not great. A bit boring.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|A relationship isn't always a Cinderella tale. I love the up & downs EVa & GC have. They love each other more then any one knows although they seriously have issues. People are reading the series like it's suppose to be peaches and cream. I love the obsession and possession these two have. I can relate in ways to the series maybe that's why I love it so much. So when reading this serious don't over think and analyze just enjoy it !
B002HML6Y8|5.0|I love this movie, but I did not know it was available in bluray.  I am very pleased, and love to watch it.
B00B0YL0E0|5.0|These guys killed at ProgPower XIII last year, their first American gig.  I hope they do a US tour for this project.  They just get it.  Always entertaining, projects of energy and passion.  Hard rock for rock/metal fans across the board.
B002OG5GT8|4.0|Not bad, hate the extra wires though. Overall it did increase the volume levels to where I can get more into the music. It was worth the buy.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|cant wait for the new season.....I'm just hooked on the whole plot and I'm just devastated about the ending....it's all too likelike when happiness comes at a bittersweet price!
B0019EXZY4|5.0|This is a great movie! I got it as a gift for my husband, and he just loved it! A must have!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I would watch it again....I secretly dream of becoming an expatriate and getting away from this horrible country...not sure why people are beating down the doors to get in.
B000XSWVEC|5.0|I got this movie for my daughter who is a drummer, and It's a great drama movie! It really gets you into it!
B008M87GJK|5.0|tired of the talking heads on tv?  well here is where you can get pure news.  i only wish that I could get the kindle to play the flash videos that are available.........=(
B00004T2FQ|5.0|We have seen this opera several times, but were inspired to get the CD after seeing the delightful movie &#34;Quartet&#34;.
B005LAIHZY|3.0|I'm a bit worried about Pixar of late... they seem to be having a hard time finding their way since UP, which was followed by the overestimated TOY STORY 3, and the \\"let's never mention this again\\" CARS 2 ... BRAVE seemed like a shot at returning to form with a new original story.<br /><br />And there is much to admire here.  The animation is, of course, outstanding - reportedly a new software upgrade was required for handling the heroine's fiery red hair, and it shows.  Pixar has yet to falter in the graphics department, and BRAVE is a stunning and beautiful film to behold!  The voice acting is typically top shelf as well, with the likes of Emma Thompson, Kelly McDonald, and Bill Connoly leading the cast.  And the underlying theme of learning how to swallow your pride and admit mistakes is a very good one to share with the youngsters.<br /><br />With a strong foundation such as this, it is a shame that the movie ends up feeling so ... bland.  The problem here is that there really isn't anything new to sink your teeth into.  Perhaps we hold Pixar to too high of a standard now after one major innovative story after another.  I have long bragged over Pixar's ability to avoid the commonalities of Disney and other animated features - but here things are about as rudimentary as they come.<br /><br />So how many over-worn story elements you can find here:<br /><br />We have a young princess (check) who has a problem with her parents authority (check) who decides to follow her own path (check) which leads her to making a deal with a witch (check) that ends up backfiring and hurting those she loves (check), requiring her to mature in order to solve the problem (check) - but in doing so, she still ultimately kind of gets what she originally wanted (check and check).<br /><br />Supposedly there was originally an intention to make this more of an adventure story of the \\"good vs. evil\\" kind, and you can see in the build up of the heroine how this might have been.  She is an expert archer in the medieval days of Scotland - a setting rife with possibilities for adventure.  But, midway through you can sense the script being wrested out of one pair of hands and into another as the story takes a right turn into fable territory... one wonders how this setup might have functioned as more of an adventure.<br /><br />But as I said, the theme overall is a good one, and the relationship that builds between Merida and her mother is a very touching and positive one.  There is certainly a strong pro-family message here, which is always nice.<br /><br />However, there are also the typical ongoing tropes that are, sadly, rampant in Disney's films of late - adult responsibility is not as important as personal freedom, men are immature idiots while woman must take up their slack, etc...<br /><br />And most annoying of all, nearly every shot of the movie has to have someone bumping into something, or being hit by something, or screaming, or falling, or laughing uproariously.  It's as if the filmmakers are afraid of losing the kids' interest for a split second, so they had to dress up every shot with some overly kinetic movement.  Add to this the over-animation of the characters.  Merida cannot simply bob her head as she utters a line - she has to sweep her hair up, or fall onto a bed and then roll off, or bulge her eyes, or something... these are the elements that are common among Disney films, but have not plagued the Pixar movies of the past.<br /><br />Overall, BRAVE is a passable piece of entertainment - but it quickly leaves you once you've walked away.  Enjoyable? Sure... but BEST ANIMATED FEATURE?  Hardly!  The handful of children I know of who have seen it have expressed no interest in seeing it again.  That's your target audience, Pixar - I hope you're paying attention!<br /><br />I'm  not excited about Pixar continuing this year with the \\"franchise development\\" mentality in delivering a MONSTERS, INC prequel ... I really want to see them getting back to groundbreaking and innovative storytelling - and keeping away from the commonalities of children's animation - here's hoping the best animation studio in the business will remember it's roots!!
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|Well if you believe that Martial Law, military interventionism and practically the mass-genocide by a corrupt dictator under the name of \\"civil\\" war is a good thing than this might be a good movie. If you are seeking a honest historically depiction do not look to this movie. In all fairness some of the points to the 13th amendment were honest and accurate. The real licoln would not serve the agenda of the government schools who's intentions seem to be to indoctrinate the masses into believing that personal liberty is dangerous and that government interventionism is the answer.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is very hard and challenging. Trying to get the most points possible and be in first place and that is why I love this game so much.
B001JI72AI|5.0|We saw this movie right after coming back from the trip for Kennedy Space Center in Florida. People in this true story showed infinite appetites for the frontier, and spirits of never-give-up. You can find the spirit of America in this movie.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I enjoyed the book but it was very predictable. Kind of disappointed because I had it figured out early on. Since I paid for it I was going to read the whole book. I love John Grishams books but have not read on in awhile that was a 5 star, IMO. Maybe better luck next time.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|You will fall in love with the characters as if they are your own family.  What an incredible Novel. I couldn't put it down.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|I am a new viewer of British TV.  This was a good one! I would recommend it to a friend.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|I would recommend this movie for the whole family. It may not be suitable for young children, but was well worth watching. I will watch it again and again.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|Downloaded this app, but it freezes up when I try to open it. Tried to download again, but it will not.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|I  was absolutely amazed when I started reading this book. I instantly fell  in love with this book. Although I was pleased about how the book ended... I still sort of wish that it ended differently.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|Boring and predictable with a few (very few) funny scenes. Not worth the money until it comes out on netflix.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a great game I'd recommend it to anyone who likes challenges, at first I was  sceptical of getting this game but then I saw my friends playing it and I tried it out and now I can't stop playing! Enjoy !
B00APJLFEG|5.0|My boys 21(has Downs Syndrome), 13 and 8 loved this movie. It is a great movie for parents to enjoy with their children!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking Dead is by far the best show I've ever watched.  I dont have standard cable so I just use Netflix.  I always heard people talking about this show but never understood what all the hype was about.  One day I took a notion to start in on Season 1 and I was hooked!  I watched the first two seasons on Netflix within a few days, then began ordering the new ones on Amazon Instant Video.  I would def recommend this show to anyone, but I do think you should start with Season 1 instead of picking it up in the middle because the story line is awesome and it helps to know the backstory so you can be up-to-date with the new episodes.
B00BJO5SXK|5.0|Looking for a summer album, this may just be it. Its heart felt and soulful. That may sound strange, but Tyler has stepped up his musical game.<br /><br />It tells the story of Wolf, a kid that's new to Camp Flog Gnaw.<br /><br />And the packaging is just great, cover art by Mark Ryden is just fantastic!!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Les Misérables is a classic, and I have enjoyed the different versions of it in the past; but this one is something very special. The fact that the actors and actresses sing live not prerecorded bring it to an emotional level unprecedented by the other versions. Everyone in this movie is extremely talented, and the movie is well done. The story itself is very moving, and this is one movie that I wanted to own because I want to enjoy it many times. I give this my highest recommendation. Well done, indeed.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I am so mad I didn't buy this sooner! This was a great read, the writer fully drew the characters in.. such a good love story! Oh, and that part 2 was released today is perfect. Buy this book.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I bought this collection for my mother-in-law, she loves Castle. When she got home from her trip my husband and I gave it to her, she started watching it that evening. The next evening she told me she watched the whole Season 1. Thanks Amazon.
B008XG1X18|5.0|My all time favorite app!!!! I love to collect recipes, so I do that here! As well as lots of do it yourself crafts,  that I plan to do soon. I love love love it!!!

B00A4GXJD0|4.0|Initially gave it a poor rating but boy did the songs grow on me. Great music unlike pop takes a few spins to appreciate.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This was my first &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; book, and I am now reading number 4; I really like the character and the stories!<br /><br />This is the genre of my choice.  I have read all of Vince Flynn's &#34;Mitch Rapp&#34; books, all of Brad Thor's &#34;Scot Harveth&#34; books; all of Steve Berry's &#34;Cotton Malone&#34; books.  For me, these are just enjoyable reads on a plane, by the pool, or when re-runs hit the TV.<br /><br />With this in mind, I think  Lee Child does a very good job of making his characters human -- I really care what happens to them; and his stories compelling.  Reading the books in order makes getting to know these characters just that much more enjoyable.<br /><br />You probably won't learn anything reading &#34;Killing Floor,&#34; but I will wager your flight will go faster!
B00BMUYLSE|5.0|Like all great music this CD gets better with every spin. The lyrics can be strange but thats Bowie. One of the best guitar CDs out there.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This game is proubly the most awesome tablet game I have bought<br />This game is not a waste of money
B0050DIWFC|2.0|The pace of this book was at times grindingly slow and the first person narative overly self absorbed. Worse still were the disturbing passages dealing with animal cruelty and animal suffering. In all I am sorry I purchased and read it. it was a depressing read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I chose 5 stars because I couldn't stop reading this book! This book  was amazing! I would recommend this book to everyone..<br />Must read kind of book
B00APKIN1I|5.0|Music should sound like this, and the recording process should be organic and cohesive.  This album demonstrates this and executes the art amazingly.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|As a huge fan of post apocalyptic science fiction stories, I enjoyed the book immensely. It's the kind of beginning tale that has plenty of potential to be taken in many directions and also is so vastly scalable. Story paces along nicely but also has depth.
0385349831|3.0|By Paulo Coelho<br />Alfred A. Knopf, 190 pgs<br />978-0-385-34983-3<br />Translated from the Portuguese by Margaret Jull Costa<br />Rating: 3<br /><br />It is the afternoon of 14th of July, of the year 1099, the eve of battle. The crusaders have surrounded Jerusalem and a crowd has gathered in the street to hear a gentlemen, referred to only as \\"the Copt,\\" speak. He is mysterious and considered wise and accompanied by the patriarchs of the three monotheistic religions calling Jerusalem home. The people want to know how to carry on, whatever happens tomorrow. So in the style of the ancient Greeks, the Copt invites their questions and attempts to answer them.<br /><br />Speak to us about defeat. Only those that give up are defeated. Everyone else is victorious. The defeated are the ones who never fail because they have never tried.<br /><br />Tell us about solitude. If you are never alone, you cannot know yourself.<br /><br />What about those who are afraid to change? The correct path is the path of nature, which is constantly changing.<br /><br />What is the meaning of life? There is no answer to this. The quest is the meaning.<br /><br />Regret. Wake up tomorrow and treat it as the first day of the rest of your life. This one is familiar, everyone has heard this one. Is it cliche, pablum, or Zen? What is the difference?<br /><br />What about work? Work should be the manifestation of love, not just selling your time, for you cannot get it back.<br /><br />Tell us what the future holds. Listen to the wind but don't forget about your horse.<br /><br />Speak to us of the weapons we must use when all is lost. Where loyalty exists, weapons are of no use.<br /><br />What about enemies? Beware of those who try to please you all the time.<br /><br />Manuscript Found in Accra certainly does tackle the hard stuff: war, peace, knowledge, victory, defeat, success, time, religion, love, sex; all the biggies. Unfortunately, it is often the literary equivalent of \\"live, laugh, love.\\" Some readers prefer their philosophy simple, believe that anything too convoluted is unnecessary and needlessly complicates timeless truths. Others agree with H.L. Mencken: \\"For every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong.\\" Still others will call it Zen.<br /><br />I found a few passages I truly appreciated:<br /><br />There is no such thing as wasted time.<br /><br />To those who believe that adventures are dangerous, try routine, that kills you far more quickly.<br /><br />False wisdom is all the unnecessary rules, regulations and measurements intended to make you behave.<br /><br />Avoid those who are only at your side in moments of sadness.<br /><br />When enthusiasm wanes because of difficulties, reach for discipline.<br /><br />Anxiety will never disappear. But here is how you deal: \\"Excessive caution destroys the soul and the heart, because living is an act of courage, and an act of courage is always an act of love.\\"<br /><br />And my favorite: Success is being able to go to your bed at night with your soul at peace. Imagine what that could do for the world.<br /><br />If you're a fan of characterization and/or plot, then you will want to look elsewhere.

B009K0P10K|4.0|has kept me engaged, caring about or loathing the characters! one episode to the next. hope there is a season 3
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This game offers very nice graphics in both smooth play and lifelike motion with horse and rider. Easy to play mini games and random ways to gain further gems and gold. Their free gem option however I find greatly lacking and either this option is always having connection issues or doesn't work at all. I have yet to receive any of the gems I have completed the offers for. Better to gain gems from leveling or the random quests offered.
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|You can nearly read the book in the time it takes to watch this - which is the first of three films derived from it - really - I'm not kidding.  I had hopes for better.  It's watered down to near dullness and has way too much added to stretch it out.  Visually appealing.  Some great actors, but too many fast action bloodless fight scenes.  Eminently pausible - it took me most of a day to get through it. Hoping for better in the second and third film, but with low expectations.
0802473156|5.0|This book has inspired me to pay closer attention to how others interact with me and others. To determine their love languages. Helps tremendously for appreciation of others and allow others to appreciate me the way i need it.
B004UG7RQ0|4.0|I was excited to get the new iPhone, except for the new cord. This was a farely inexpensive solution to be able to play music from the phone on my dock. The volume isn't quite as loud as I'd like it to be, but the sound quality seems the same as pluging an iPod direction onto the dock. Nice little adapter.
0060595183|3.0|while i understand it is a classic drug remembrance must read book, i found it to be interesting only that it was the beginning of modern day documentation of altered experiences.

0143039601|3.0|my introduction to stream of conscienceness writing. loved his documenttion of his travels. I have been told i need to document my travels better.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so amazing I love playing it I let some little kids play it on the bus nd they think it is so so so much fun.
B00C4QWDYY|5.0|I absolutely love this show. It's not overly gory. It's not often you find a show you become emotionally attached to. I love the characters and find it to be well written and surprising. I recommend The Walking Dead to people regularly. I enjoy watching it and discussing it with people. I can't wait for October and the new season!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love it! I could play Flow Free all day. The only thing I could ask for is more levels.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|I wanted to like this book.  The reviews were outstanding.  But the truth is, when I finished this series, I felt like I had wasted days of my life.  While I feel like it COULD have been a very intriguing story, and in many ways, it was, I still feel like it was lacking in so many areas.  Perhaps the details were too tedious for my liking.  It just seems like there were so many words for such little action.  Regardless, I was greatly disappointed.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was great, hated for it to come to an end. Could seem to put the book down over the weekend, even made me shed a few tears!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love it! I just wish it had the square root function on the  kindle fire it's something I need please!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This series is very entertaining. I wasn't sure at first if I would like it but I was hooked from the very first episode and wanting more!
B0089LOKHG|5.0|This was a fun, fast, entertaining read. The ending was perfect. It tied up the story lines just enough, but left some open to the reader's imagination. Ultimately it is a carpe diem, call to arms-type story.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|My son and I love this movie. Its adorable and heartwarming and perfect for a child to watch. The special edition hopping eggs are super cute. This will likely be one of our favorites for a long time.<br /><br />my only complaint is that the free digital download does not work on my Kindle, there is some app or software that needs to de installed and its not compatible with the Kindle OS. It would be awesome if they could get that fixed up...
B005KDDUVS|5.0|I'm not much of a reader, and  I absolutely loved this book. It is not a short reading for me, and I just didn't felt the pages. I wanted to continue reading it and it got me from page 1. I liked both the story and the characters in it very much, I also enjoyed that it takes place in Barcelone, if you've ever been there, you'll feel a little bit nostalgic about the places.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Nice little model. Lots of smaller pieces, but makes for a great cubicle accessory at work. Would definitely again if more versions came out.
0385535147|5.0|“The Racketeer” is an unusual book for Mr. Grisham. Unlike many of his others, it has no soapbox to stand on and is not out to teach lessons about justice. This book is much more duplicitous than that. In its early stages it does follow the familiar Grisham template, in which a lawyer finds himself unexpectedly in legal trouble. But then it breaks out into the exhilarating tale of how Mal, a disbarred attorney, now a savvy, self-taught legal scholar, leads his pursuers on a long, winding chase.<br /><br />another must read from Mr Grisham.
B00ADLCC9I|4.0|This isn't a $300 tablet. What this is, however, is a decent $170 one. I don't think it's meant for hardcore app gamers and they may find it lacking in a number of areas, but I think it's fine for advanced casual gamers who's looking for more than what a phone can offer.<br />At it's heart, it's a table and a pretty good one. Android's Jellybean OS runs pretty smooth and quickly without any problems as far as I could tell.<br />The screen is just ok though. It's viewable, but it could be less gainy, plus, colors look a bit faded. However, it is responsive.<br />It's not on the Ipad's or Nexus's level, but I do think it can serve a basic user's needs well.

B005HI4LMS|5.0|This movie is hilarious.  The dialog between Tucker and Dale is great, the situation is not so absurd that you can't see it happening.  This is the route the \\"Scary Movie\\" series should have taken.  If you like unusual (and slightly dark) comedies this is one to check out.
