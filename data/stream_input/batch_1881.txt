B00992CF6W|3.0|first of all you should have every item in creative so u can go to the nether make pigs from eggs and nonlinear multiplayer so you don't need some one withit at your house.and u should be able to have more mobs like blazes pigmen and ghasts.plus you should be able to custimize your skin and download mobs.overall this needs some work right now it should be worth $2 and if you add all that stuff $6. PLEASE DONT HATE ME FOR SAYING THIS I LOVE MINECRAFT!!!!
B000KJD5JY|5.0|This book is both beautifully written and exquisitely painful regarding human interaction. It ought to be reread every five years.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Incredibly addicting. Play time is relative short per session but that is good imo. So get out there and mutate.
B0017YWG2S|5.0|Of all the Jobim music on albums, I love this CD the best. The music is, of course, sexy and endlessly evocative, but the singing on this album makes it simply the best.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved the book.  Just draws you into the story.  A great way to pass the day and sucks you into the romance of it.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|This app is awesome. Easy to navigate. I am sure everyone is familiar with google? Make it easier to just tap the icon..
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|I am using Nexus 10 and i have windows 8 in my laptop.I can use windows 8 in full extend. Awesome app.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Game was fun. Lots of fun puzzles and hidden objects throughout the game. Makes you think a little too! Try the free version.
0061733199|5.0|Some people may say the SAS is dated, however, I found that everything is well informed and well presented.  Very good book for reference and to add to the bug out bag...
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Quality of the movie was fantastic! I rent this movie often.. It was that good!! Rent it and see for yourself.. Don't miss out!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Very fast delivery!!  My son was so happy Christmas morning!  Now we have 3 different perplexus toys and my boys love them all!
B004XDYJRU|1.0|After reading the reviews and seeing as it was free, I decided to download the app.  Shortly afterward, my phone froze while trying to run an update on another piece of software. So, I pulled the battery and restarted the phone. It never came back from the logo screen when trying to reboot. I tried several times, pulling the battery each time, and finally it just never turned back on.  Very sad, but happy to have purchased the Verizon extended warranty. New phone arrives today.
B00008G7UJ|5.0|The movie is phenomenol modern take on the classic story. It gives it so much more perspective. Its a fast paced thriller.
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|I'm a grandmother with grandchildren and we all love to play it. It is a fun and challenging game to play.
B001DDBCUA|5.0|Very NIce I love it. I'm making a collection of Sex and the City. I will be shopping another items.
B007SY3CEW|5.0|I'm a grandmother with grandchildren and we all love to play it. It is a fun and challenging game to play.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I usually get bored with movies, etc... But this is the BEST show I've ever seen! The first season is still my favorite because they pull you in and you can't stop watching!
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I'm a grandmother with grandchildren and we all love to play it. It is a fun and challenging game to play.
B009CPJHY4|2.0|THis was certainly a surprise! I expected it to be better! It was slow and plodding and predictable! I gave 2 stars for the scenery. The country was lovely. Don't bother!
0802798225|5.0|I remember when I first found this book, It had just came out and I was roaming the shelves at my local bookstore. When I saw the cover, I was like I hope it's not some corny story, but when I realized the author, I knew that could not be possible. This book turned me on to reading more than I ever did. I couldn't believe how great this book was, and when I found out it became a triology, it gave me something to look forward too. Perfect Chemistry is a first choice that I would recommend to anyone who isn't that much into reading or ever wants an amazing read.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Elf is funny and heartwarming. What else can you ask for from a holiday movie? One of Will Ferrell's best.
B00000IUT7|5.0|I rated 5 stars because it is great train along with the BRIO Battery Operated Action Train; however, both quit running the same day even after changing the batteries 2xs. Hard on a train lover when you have to return item.
B00846REIS|2.0|Too much like 50 shades, no real difference in the story.  Controlling man and a weak woman with esteem issues
B002RI9SC4|4.0|I reread this book after seeing the final film, just to check my facts! I enjoyed the reread, especially on kindle, as the book version is super heavy!
B004ZJZPWA|5.0|Great movie at a great value and was shipped very quickly.  I would recommend seeing this movie was very entertaining.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|After I saw this movie for the first time I posted this on Facebook;<br /><br />\\"Just watched a gut wrenching movie called \\"Brick\\". If Pulp Fiction got together and had a kid with Breakfast Club and then somehow it was raised by Tyler Durden, this would be it\\"<br /><br />I stand by that. I think it accurately sums up this movie. Went into Brick with high expectations and was blown away. The main character is outstanding. His acting is daring and had me yelling at the screen at least twice. To say the least, I got emotionally involved in his circumstances.<br /><br />Like Pulp Fiction, this is a movie I wish I could un-see, so that I could watch it again for the first time. The ending is climatic and twisted. I loved the characters, they seemed so complete. Some parts of the movie were outrageously funny in how absurd they were. The cherry on top of the cake was that the girl who played an important part throughout the movie was drop dead gorgeous.<br /><br />Put down your phone and watch Brick giving it the attention it deserves.
B0056BU3I2|5.0|Great movie at a great value and was shipped very quickly.  I would recommend seeing this movie was very entertaining.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I saw him on a live show a couple of years ago and fell in love with his music at that time.  I have several of his CD's now and love this Christmas one.
B004E547D8|5.0|Great movie at a great value and was shipped very quickly.  I would recommend seeing this movie was very entertaining.
B00338QENI|5.0|I loved this book. It was heartbreaking and inspirational.<br />Rebecca Skloot showed great respect for the Lacks family. My daughter is now reading it for her biotech class.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Great movie at a great value and was shipped very quickly.  I would recommend seeing this movie was very entertaining.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|who did this to us!!!!!! GOD DAMNIT IM HERE ON BUSINESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! then she farted in her sleep, i was gone before she woke up.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is by far my favorite book!! A great love story with non stop drama! I couldn't put it down!! I have read it several times and every time I fall more in love with it! I cannot wait to read Travis` side here in a couple months... I am on the count down until it is released!
B002C6A6N6|5.0|From the product description I was a little concerned this was not the item I was looking for. It turned out to be exactly what I was looking for. I love this set. It is awesome and the boxes &#34;seasons&#34; are well put together. Any Dr. Quinn fan - this is a MUST! The price is unbeatable!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great book, awesome story line and easy to follow, can't wait for book 3 to cone out, I can only imagine where their relationship goes from here!
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|I got this as a Christmas gift for someone else. Totally happy about the packaging and fast shipment. The receiver absolutely loves the movie. Thank you for this awesome gift!
B009IRVSVQ|3.0|Wasn't crazy about this CD.  His last one was better.  Going to give it another try and see if any of the songs catch on.  Not loving it so far.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Epic love it!  Cinematography, soundtrack and acting. Great story weaving. So you have to watch more then once to really appreciated, good trade off.
B004JMY312|4.0|there really aren't any other words but classic, like really. Anyone who watches this movie will have a good time. :)
B001ILHY1I|5.0|This movie has all that you would expect from Statham lots of action from the first and all the way thru. I think anyone who likes action and fiction (that may not be for long at the rate we are going) you will enjoy this movie
B009E3EXMU|5.0|This DVD CD box set was absolutely fantastic, Jason Bonham did an excellent job playing with the band. What can really be said<br /> about Jimmy Page, he still one of the best!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|why cant i see past the first ten posts?  Over $300 for this device and i cant use it for daily stuff.  VERY disapointed!!!  Come on and fix it!!!!
B005WYFLNU|5.0|We have purchased a number of reusable sticker pads, and I love all of them.  Very fun, very nicely made, and very easy to pick-up.  My girls love these stickers.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|The most complete of the &#34;complete&#34; stories I have seen. A must have for the fans of the great detective.
B0067R0APK|2.0|I used this app for 4 mos no issues.<br />Now all of a sudden it keeps asking daily to sign into Amazon app store.  Will probably uninstall if this keeps happening.
B009O2XY12|3.0|This is a good game however the energy resupply only happens every 30 minutes forcing to purchase items inorder to continue playing. You'll lose the energy if you're accidentally disconnected from the web without being about to resume.
B009KHVU7G|3.0|I did not know that it was in German. I think you need to advertise more when it's not an English speaking movie. We were able to switch it over to English, but all the previews are in German and it prohibits the language to be changed during them.
071815892X|5.0|This is a great beginning cookbook for pre-teens/teenagers who are starting to take an interest in cooking. (especially if they are budding Anglophiles).  The recipes are broken down so they are easy, use few ingredients and they embrace shortcuts (Their version of Eggs Benedict calls for instant hollandaise sauce) which is great for the busy working parents.  Many of their recipes can be seen in action on their YouTube channel for more step-by-step instruction.
B009MF56GC|3.0|The movie itself was very good, but the quality of the DVD was not good. Several parts of the movie were grainy, which should not happen with Blu-ray.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put this one down! It's one of the best books I have ever read. Now I am looking forward to book3.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|This game did not have instructions so you are going blind in the game and not knowing really what to do next or how to move ahead in the game.  Did not like it whatsoever.
B000FC13MM|5.0|Amazing story, wonderfully written. This is a book that I have read over and over again.<br />I highly recommend reading it.
B009O2XY12|1.0|This one just doesn't make it.  Not enjoyable and no hints.  Graphics are good and music is okay.  Moves slow occasionally.
B005LAIIPS|3.0|not Jason Bourne.. obscure plot line.. like a Bond chase ....did not really like part played by the female actress..
B009O07NDY|5.0|I just received the soundtrack. The app that came with it allowing me to view trailers and behind the scenes footage is great! I loved watching the movie and enjoy listening to the music.
B00A2H9L2E|5.0|this is a movie that will surprize you in all aspects.i was thinking this was going to be poorly done but it was really great. i have the video game which was fun to play.movie was better. i liked it.it was different and surprizing!!!!i ordered this movie from amazon.ive seen this in the movies.cant wait till it gets here. i think it will release in feb 2013...
1589795474|5.0|I read this during my college years and am now a grandmother giving it to a grandson about to launch into independence.  A classic work on the wisdom of staying within your means and saving aggressively.  And the best wisdom around when you consider the current return on investments.  My grandson, like most young people, wants to begin his journey living at the level of wealth his parents have.  He needs to hear the wise messages of the post-depression years embedded here and to find his happiness in his relationships, his health, and his achievements while he builds his material wealth slowly and steadily with sound principles.  This book has many of the right messages if he has an ear to hear them.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|In the future we have destroyed our planet... But somehow managed to figure out a way to drill and travel through it.  I get it. It is a science-fiction movie, allowances need to be made. But, when Quaid opens his safety deposit box, he finds stacks of currency waiting for him, WITH OBAMA'S FACE ON IT! This is supposedly a future where America doesn't even survive, and we are to believe that somehow President Obama has made such an impact on the world, that his face is used on foreign currency centuries later.  What a stretch even for Hollywood liberals.
B009NQKXYK|2.0|what a major disapointment as a precursor to the alien series.there was nothing to get excited about.big loser.i surprised<br />given the director's reputation in this genre.
0316096199|5.0|A fascinating, yet, sorrid story that grabs you from the beginning. A book for young and older readers. Recommend this book.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|after all the hoopla about this movie i give it's  a c-.. i am sorry i bothered to pay for this.
B000EGFVQS|5.0|Very heartfelt and traumatic book. I have seen the movie and ither way it will grab you and pull you in.
B004RE29PO|4.0|this is one of the few movies that almost equals the original movie and had a plausible plot! i like it!!!!!
B009ZE27US|1.0|This doesn't work at all. I guess it is just to be funny or something. It doesn't even scan your fingerprint.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I'm glad others agree. A great masterpiece , and frankly, I didn't think King had it in him. I read this quite a while ago but it's still there with me. God bless you King.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|To really understand the significance of the Navy Seals, the author takes you through the whole process of becoming a Seal. The drive, and the dedication of such an elite squad is beyond comprehension for the ordinary citizen to digest. All of his recollections of his duties leading up to the raid were  phenomenal including the rescue of Captain Phillips against the Somalian pirates. The planning and the politics involved is a tremendous testimony to how our government operates on such accuracy before giving the final approval. Making sure that only lives of offenders are taken speaks volumes of our country's integrity. Perhaps not the quickest read book and not as riveting as  other books of its genre but the details were absolutely necessary from start to finish.
B0041KVW2K|1.0|I was so excited to receive this boxset for Christmas. The packaging is georgeous! I listen to vinyl records all the time, and I love the idea of new Beatles vinyl with replica sleeves, etc.<br /><br />I put on the first album (Please Please Me) and it sounded great, and I began looking through the book. For some reason several of the pages were stuck together, and there are weird marks on the bottom of most of the pages. One single page had a dent in it, like the stack for that page got caught in a machine while it was being assembled. But I didn't want this for the book, so I was willing to let that go.<br /><br />I began listening to the second album \\"With The Beatles\\", and to be honest the sound seemed a little off. The instrumental tracks were a bit distorted/buzzy. I put on side two and that's where things went really wrong. It looks like something happened across the tracks on side two during the manufacturing process. There are no scratches or anything, but you can see a strange area that is different from the rest of the grooves, and when my needle (brand new Octofon needle on high-end turntable) hits it the music is distorted, garbled, and/or skips. This is a big disappointment.<br /><br />I guess I got one of the bad pressings...not sure how many of the other albums will have similar flaws?<br /><br />I would return for a replacement, but from the reviews here I'm thinking that I should get a refund instead.<br /><br />Really disappointed!
B0041KKYGU|1.0|Title says it all. Movie could not have possibly done well at box office. Trailer showed the best parts and the remainder of the movie was a flop. Probably appealed to a much younger generation....one that could watch test pattern and be entertained.
B00846REIS|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read and I think it's better than the fifty shades of grey so far!!!!
B0002Y69NQ|2.0|I tried playing the discs, but none of them would work properly and that too the first time after i got it! It's brand new.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|When I started this book I was not sure that I was going to like it.  It seemed to be trying to hard to be more than what it was. The reality is by the half way point I was hooked into the story line. Would I consider this a masterpiece of literature? No but it is a guilty pleasure that I'm looking forward to continuing by reading the remaining books.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|This album is even better than the last.  I can't stop listening to it.  The fist single (I Will Wait) is one of the best songs, but there are plenty others that are extremely good.  Really no weak songs on the album.
B007XHWROK|5.0|Since I purchased this CD as a gift, I am rating it purely on appearances.  The CD arrived in very good condition.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|This thing is a blast.  Very challenging, but really fun to try to go &#34;just a little further&#34;.  My 13-year-old loves it (and so do I).  Lots of fun and a relief from all the electronic games found everywhere.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I am not usually a musical buff but this was amazing. I had to buy the soundtrack as soon as I came home from watching the movie!
075669812X|5.0|My son has been begging me for this books, as he is a huge Ninjago fan.  He is 7.  Great book, he loves looking at all the characters and comparing them to which ones he has.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|Great movie. Beautiful animation and good storyline. Wish it had more sing along songs. My daughter watched it several times.
B002BWP49M|5.0|Great movie, daughter loved it, as well as my son even though he may not admit it.  lol Good price!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is a great way to keep up with family and friends.  I'm not sure why I am rating Facebook on here.
B00336G7HI|5.0|I heard a lot about the phony battery out there. I checked the tip on identifying the phony one and I got the right one without an issue. The battery is good. I only charged one time so far and I don't know about the long term use. So far so good with my purchase.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Watched it on my Kindle while flying from the west coast to Memphis. Kept me entertained most of the way home.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|This movie starts well, but gets even better as the story progresses. Has a few turns that keep you guessing. Overall a good Sci-Fi action movie without bad language or sex that would make it inappropriate for teens. Violence gives it the PG-13 rating. I give it 5 stars!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love puzzle games. This one is easy to learn and hard to put down. I played it for hours the first time.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|EASY TO READ, NICE BACKGROUND COLOR, EASY TO USE.  GREAT TO USE INSTEAD OF THE OLD TYPE CALCULATORS, WHICH IS SOMETIMES HARD TO READ.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|this is an awesome game. i enjoy playing it to relax or just have some fun. it keeps me out of trouble
B004GYY714|5.0|LOVE THIS APP.  WHERE I WORK IT IS TOTALLY QUIET.  NEEDED SOME MUSIC TO MAKE THE DAY GO BY.  I LISTEN TO THE TOM JOYNER MORNING SHOW THEN THE FREE 24/7 JAZZ STATION.  NOT A LOT OF REPETITION OR COMMERCIALS.
0545265355|5.0|i love this series reading helps me wind down at night. this was a good read for a few weeks
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I loved this book.  Well written and a great adventurous story.  It keeps a steady pace and keeps you wanting to read more!
0060254920|5.0|this is my childhood favorite. i bought this to read to my nephews so they too could have an adventurous imagination.
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|This cover does the job--protect the Kindle--but it is awkward. Holding the Kindle with the cover on is a bit uncomfortable.
B0063GORYU|5.0|i love spider so i am partial  but this game is is fun to me and challenges me as well
B006X415GK|4.0|This doll is a lot of fun for kids to play with. The hair is plastered down, which prevents it from getting mussed in the first day. The joints make it easy to play with and the stand is helpful.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Entertainment at my fingertips..I just love it.<br />It is kind of addictive. It makes the time easier to fill. I enjoy it so very much.
B009EE4K86|4.0|good movie i have 16 more words to write now 11 and 8 i dont do reviews because they take too much time...
B003UESJHE|5.0|Amazing acting, writing, and camera work. Colin Firth's facial expressions and mannerisms are unbelievable, and Geoffrey Rush is as great as ever.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I love this tale of young love and the trials of growing up when you don't quite fit the mold!  I am crazy about this story. It has a funny wacky side but also makes good life lessons.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|This was an easy way to the the latest Rush Album. Fast and easy and has it's own cloud.  I was able to bring the files into iTunes no problem.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great for the kids, they can play while on trips and not violent, controls are simple, not any problems on my Fire
0805092447|5.0|The repeating words teach reading skills at a young age.  The story is very cute. Suitable for either boy or girl
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Not the best written book, felt like it was written by a 3rd grade student. But, hearing first hand what happened, plus he did not come off as taking all the credit. Like the way he said team throughout the book
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is an awesome book nd I really like it nd I hope you enjoy it as much as I did
B0086700CM|4.0|headline says it all, if you have kids that like to play on your devices, this one will keep them entertained for miles while driving
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This is definitely the best Batman they've made.  I did love the Joker in the last movie, but this one tops it!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was another one of Riordian´s masterpieces.  As usual, he put in lots of details and puts in images so descriptive, I feel as if I'm there, watching the challenges they face.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|It lives up to the trailers and then some.  This movie was hilarious.  My friends and even my husband agree!!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Love it.. Great qualily.. I love the color.. I do wish there were more color choices.. Lime green.. Purple.. Light blue and more...
1419705849|5.0|This is the one my nephew most wanted. I am pleased that he enjoys reading so much. He loves it.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|So far I like Facebook on my new Kindle Fire HD but I haven't explored too much of it so far!!
0810994739|5.0|The child loves it. He is collecting the entire series. What else can I say? Too many words required here!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Works wonderfully on my new Kindle Fire HD!!  Highly recommend the download!!  Just another great way to keep with the Jones!! :)
B0032JTV6U|3.0|though we love the dvd as far as the content, two of the dvd's skip and stop playing. we still love the show, just not the condition of product.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is just an incredible book. Colleen Hoover has managed yet another story that is exceptionally well written. She has the ability to convey so many different emotions, some tragic and others infinitely tender.  I don't know how she does it. I cannot even describe the jumble of emotions I had at the end of this book. All I can say is, read it. The theme is definitely not lighthearted nor young YA, but it serves an often \\"forbidden\\" topic in a well conveyed manner. Oh, and thanks to Colleen's husband for that one word in that one sentence that made the book worthwhile.... ;-)
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|this is a great show, that ran its course and ended on a high note.  Needed this season to complete my series.
0312370849|5.0|Great! This is a good item and it will be use for a long time to come.  I like it.
B0053O89WY|5.0|One of the most, if not the most, original comedy series ever.  A wonderful cast with original lines and great story line.
1416968725|5.0|My one and three year old got this book from the library and it instantly became a favorite, so much so we had to buy it because we reached all our checkout limits.  Beautiful art.  Cute story.  And both of mine love the last page with the SNAP!
0345529057|5.0|Only on book one but I love it so far. George Martin is a genius.. the series is also great and goes along well with the books
B003TSEEDY|5.0|You can't help but be in awe of the power this novel possesses. It is one of the best books I have ever read.
0767812166|5.0|Got this for my husband for Christmas, we enjoyed it very much. This film begs for a part two, I wish someone in Hollywood would do so.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|We happen to like Leonard Cohen and his back up singers and arrangements were great and a good balance for his particular delivery which is mostly talking his way through the song with a little singing as well.
B001CTGQBK|5.0|One of the classic teen movies along with American Graffiti and West Side Story, Grease captures a time in the USA that existed only in dreams. But with those other classics of teen aged life, it does it so well that you can feel the feelings of young love and angst that may have actually been familiar. The music and singing also made it a singable movie. It is one of the greats!
B00A77II0U|5.0|great game . I couldn't put it down . definitely well worth the small cost . I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys these sort of games!!
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|its a great game but having similar problems with it like I did with letters to nowhere....once I reach a certain point the game will not let me progress it just goes back to my kindle homepage
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|no tmy favorite soundtrack. Looking forward to seeing the movie to have this tie in with what I am hearing.
B007RTAR64|5.0|My 10-year old daughter went nuts when she got this!  It is a beautiful doll and a very good likeness of Jennifer Lawrence.  It was exactly what I wanted and I didn't have to pay $35 for it at Barnes & Noble!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|My kids absolutely loved it!! Can't wait to watch it again! But it is a Disney movie and pretty much everything they do is fantastic!
B008MEM24S|5.0|It was so much fun and the rest of this game was hard to find the tight path. This was fun!
0307730697|5.0|This is one of the few books I've truly had a hard time putting down.  Blehm keeps the story interesting and exciting, describing a true hero, family man and man of faith.  Excellent book and awesome story!
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|I would recommend this dvd to other people, and the purchase price was excellent. I had no problems viewing this dvd.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved the book can't wait to start next one. I just couldn't put it down. I'm sure the next will be even better
B000O77SRC|5.0|While we had some difficulty receiving this, it arrived in good condition.  Amazon was wonderful to deal with during the shipping problem.  And, of course, Die Hard is a FANTASTIC movie - but we knew that before I ordered it :)
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I know I'm in the minority, but I found it kind of boring and just not as great as the reviews lead.  It has nothing to do with the content.  Just wasn't fast pace or a page turner for me
0545128285|4.0|It's more for the mature readers(due to so many deaths) but it's a cute book. I wish their were more tales in it but the ones that are are great. Not my idea of bed time stories(harry potter people will understand what I mean) but good for just reading! The hopping pot is an ok story for young readers but he didn't really learn a lesson(read and find out) but The fountain of fortune is a very good story for all young readers! Highly recomended for them! There's not much else to it just don't get in mind of a young child! K!

1439152802|4.0|This is another book that I've had on my \\"Buy Immediately Once Published\\" list, because I've read all of Kate's other books, and I really enjoy her writing.<br /><br />It's difficult to talk about the plot at all without risking a spoiler, but I'll give it a try.  The frame of this book is Laurel's story - in 2011, Laurel is famous British actress in her sixties whose mother is dying.  Laurel and her siblings agree to take their mother, Dorothy, out of the nursing home and back to Greenacres, the farm where they grew up, to spend her last days.  Laurel has a memory of being 16 and witnessing Dorothy do something shocking - something that, though hushed up for decades, evidently is weighing heavily on Dorothy now.  Laurel decides that she has to find out the truth of what happened that day in order to really understand her mother and to help Dorothy die in peace.  The novel transitions between Dorothy's childhood, Dorothy's years in London during the Blitz, Laurel's teenage years at Greenacres, and present-day England.<br /><br />Kate has a gift for writing mystery stories that shift between narrators and generations.  Just when you feel like you are starting to see where she is going, she changes things up.  I have to admire the amount of planning she puts into her novels - her ability to weave plot threads together, with little clues and curve balls sprinkled throughout, amazes me.  Once again, Kate really surprised me with the twist at the end of this book.  I would have thought after four of her books, I would see these things coming.  I had one of those contradictory reading experiences with this book where I wanted to rush through to find out what happened, but I also wanted to ready slowly to make the book last longer.  This is a great story about the gift of second chances.
B005KJZDXK|4.0|I really enjoyed the voices and thought overall the cd was really good, but I would have enjoyed it more had there been a couple of faster tempo songs on it.
0316228532|2.0|Confession: I would have bought a copy of this book regardless of what it was about or how it was reviewed.  I adored the Harry Potter series, and I was interested to see what Rowling would chose as the subject for her first \\"adult\\" book.<br /><br />In this book, the death of parish council member Barry Fairbrother is the catalyst for a series of terrible events in the tiny English town of Pagford.  The adult community in Pagford is much more concerned about who will fill Barry's seat on the council than the fact that he's dead.  Apparently, Barry has been at the center of controversy over what the town should do with an area called \\"The Fields,\\" which is a poor housing development located between Pagford and the neighboring city of Yarville.  The election for a new council member brings skeletons out of the closet for several Pagford families.<br /><br />For a book about a small town, Rowling's cast of characters is huge.  She narrates from almost twenty different characters' perspectives, and she manages to give each one a unique voice.  The characters I found the most compelling were the teenagers.  Rowling pokes fun at people who take themselves too seriously.  She also hits on some political issues that are incredibly timely - one of the parish council members talks incredulously about how people in The Fields think they are \\"entitled\\" to housing, education, and medical care.<br /><br />I am NOT giving this book 2 stars because I think it was poorly written, or because I think the concept was bad, or because I'm mad at Rowling for writing something that wasn't another Harry Potter book.  I give this book two stars because I didn't enjoy the experience of reading it.  Every relationship in this book is flawed.  Parents emotionally or physically abuse their children.  Children rebel with drugs, sex, and embarrassing public revelations of family secrets.  Spouses are unfaithful.  Neighbors turn a blind eye to the people in their community who are suffering.  Thereis redemption for a few characters in the end of the novel, but not enough to satisfy me.  I know that's the way the world works - not everyone gets a happy ending, people don't learn from their mistakes, and sometimes \\"bad people\\" don't get what's coming to them.  But I don't really want to read 500 pages about it.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I may be too old for this sort of thing. The writing shows imagination, but the plot seems to me to be contrived. But then I'm neither a woman nor obsessed with sex as the heroine seems to be. Young women may enjoy this one, but it's not for me.
0375851569|5.0|I feel you can't  beat Dr. Seuss books especilly this collection which includes all of Dr. Seuss classics. My kindergarten granddaughter can read these books.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A  very well written fanciful survival story. As an author myself I commend Mr. Martel for capturing my undivided attention. I will avoid the movie, however, so as not to dilute my fond memory of the hero, Pi. It makes one wish for more of Pi`s life, but not merely a commentary on the original, Pi needs no commentary, but his life must go on. I am eager to see if Mr. Martel can do it again, I certainly hope so.
B008602KQI|5.0|Not for kids killing kids but I still love the movie. Can't wait to read the books in the near future.

B00A80SHFM|3.0|What's here is mostly very good. I've loved Les Miserables since I saw a touring production 20+ years ago.  I have several versions of the soundtrack including London and Broadway casts and Complete Symphonic. I've been waiting anxiously for this version.  And while I haven't seen the film yet, I just couldn't wait to get the soundtrack and revisit so many of my old favorites. After the first couple of listens, I adjusted to the live recording style of the songs being acted and now find it refreshingly different. Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, Eddie Redmayne all give amazing performances. I was even pleasantly surprised by Russell Crowe. I just wish I could give this a higher rating.<br /><br />Like many others have said, this is far too brief, even for a \\"highlights\\" album. I understand limiting the selections, but what doesn't make sense to me is how they could leave out some that are pivotal to the story. Where are \\"Lovely Ladies\\", \\"Who Am I?\\" and \\"A Little Fall of Rain\\"??? It's not just a matter of my sentimental favorites being left out, these are essential to the telling of the story, in some ways the heart of the musical.<br /><br />I should have paid closer attention to the track listing. Would the \\"highlights\\" have kept me from buying? Probably not. I do hope they release another, more complete edition, even though part of me resents the now-common practice of double-dipping with multiple releases. Luckily I was able to take advantage of the $5.00 MP3 download so if/when a more complete version is released, I won't have do much to justify the expense of a second purchase.
B00ARAN9JW|2.0|Even more so than the earlier movies, this one simply jumps in and restarts the mayhem without establishing a plot line. It tries to tie back to the previous film by repeating the last few minutes of the assualt on the bulk carrier but fails to create a believeable connection to the rest of the action.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|I enjoyed this film.  Good acting, good story. Clint Eastwood is always good, Justin Timberlake is an amazingly good actor.  I would recommend this film.
0307279189|5.0|This book could be turned into a fabulous movie! A cross between \\"romancing the stone\\" (for atmosphere) and \\"chariots of fire\\", lol...<br /><br />I bought this book months ago, but only read the first chapter or two...  I picked it up again yesterday and read the entire thing cover to cover. Simply fantastic book. I couldn't put it down. I am no writer, but I was really impressed with not just the story and factual information, but it's wonderful delivery and message. I found Mr. Mcdougall's prose very enjoyable...<br /><br />Such a well written book... stirring, motivational and informative.

B004UJAOLM|2.0|I know many people love this book, but I've read it 3 times, and I just can't appreciate it.  While I have no complaint with the technical aspects of it (writing style, grammar, etc.), the story drives me a little bit crazy and makes me depressed.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I have been up till the wee hours of the last three mornings. Doris-Kearns Goodwin has always been a favorite writer, but the subject matter in this instance, while important and of some interest, isn't my normal reading material. But \\"Team of Rivals\\" is absolutely fascinating, and the reader has got to wonder how these brilliant men and their spouses pretty much educated themselves ... and why we can't or won't do that today. We also see how difficult life was for some of our second generation ... let's call them Molding Fathers ... how they played the roles of politician, persuaders, businessmen, farmers, country gentlemen in several instances, and managed to provide the real foundation of the 20th Century. The reader has got to be awed by how this country survived the Civil War, what these people did to make certain it did survive, and then, if you'll pardon the observation, how in just the last 40 years we've had crisis after crisis which 19th century statements could have resolved, but which politicians in the 21st Century can't or worse, won't.<br /><br />On a practical note, the hardbound book is probably 1200 pages and must weigh over a pound. Well, THIS is the kind of book the Kindle Fire was made for. I downloaded it (at a discounted price to boot) and was able to read in my normal reading position, comfortably lying down. And now, I get to choose the size of the font and the background.<br /><br />On the negative side, I do wish that there were photographs of the principle characters and their wives and children and other politicians of the day. I'd also have liked a map of the U.S. at the time. But even without these, one can't get over how people traveled by cart or horse, shared rooms in taverns, forged close alliances, and how the rather \\"civilized\\" society of the 1830s and 40s could  culminate in the bloodiest war in our history. Yes, I know it's about how Lincoln brought his rivals together and got them to work together and with him, their individual chief rival, but I was still fascinated by the family and daily lives of the principles. Just think: One of the wives gave birth to 17 children in 37 years of marriage, a happy marriage at that. Now THAT's another book I'd like to read. And his kids didn't drive him nuts.<br /><br />So, this book has so much going for it, I'm not surprised it was a best seller. I am surprised that it wasn't THE best seller of the past decade. Had Congress been made to read it, maybe someone would have noted that by 1940 standards - even with a few duels thrown in - today's Congress are people behaving badly.l chief rival, but I was still fascinated by the family and daily lives of the principles.

B000JMKNJ2|5.0|I would give a five full stars to the first half of the book. It was a thrilling story packed with an unexpected twists. Main characters are very likable and one can't stop chearing for them during the ride. Few times I even compare this book to The Name of the wind (keep the hype flowing ;). Unfortunately the second part of the book wasn't that great for me. Story took different turns that I expected (for the worst) and mood of the book slightly shifts. Nevertheless it was a great read and I'm looking forward to the next book in the series.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  I usually only read \\"feel good\\" books, but this one was so exciting and full of suspense that I couldn't put it down!
B007FG9LIE|3.0|Ethan Burke travels to secluded town to find his two colleagues from Secret service. Before he gets there he ends up in the car accident that puts him to the local hospital. When he wakes up he finds out that he is unable to contact anyone outside the town or get out of it. Everything looks idilic but something's not right. He decides to take matters into his own hands and get to the bottom of everything that is happening around him.<br />The story takes lots of elements from Twin Peaks (which is acknowledged by the author in the book's &#34;credits&#34;) but stands on its own. Right from the beggining I started to worry that this is common [dream/comma scenario (hide spoiler)] but unfortunately I was quickly put in ease. In the end the final revelation was slightly too much for me but it was somehow original idea that I did not expected. Story itself and writting was decent but I expected more after reading about the book in Bloody Disgusting's Top horror books from 2012

B0076DEJMO|4.0|Say one thing for Joe Abercrombie, say he's a damn good author. But if I should be realistic I liked his previous books more with exception of the Best served cold (The Heroes &#60;- First law trilogy &#60;- Red country &#60;- Best served cold).<br /><br />Still it's pretty good book and I really liked it - hence the four stars :) I wanted to say that it's fast paced but unfortunately it's first quarter is quite slow and least entertaining which is in contrast with a great start of the story and it's second half.<br /><br />We have some recurring characters from previous books that I was really glad to meet again and loads of new ones that are a good addition to the world's lore and we will probably see them again in the future books. The western theme of the book was good choice and I loved the themes and places (especially the Deadwoodish Crease and the mountains at the end). Also the action and skirmish descriptions are great and hold up to what you are expecting from Abercrombie. They are even scenes when I literally (and I'm not mistaking it with figuratively ;) had a goosebumps (ring fight at Crease for example).<br /><br />To sum it up, it was a great read and I'm very much looking forward to the new planned trilogy, albeit it's still at least two years away. Let's hope we finally see more from the Empire of Gurkul and meet Glokta or Jezal again.

B0025KVLTM|5.0|for all those customers who gave this album 1, 2, 3 stars all i have to say to you is that you have crappy taste in music and you don't know s*** about it . Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is one of the most genuine albums to come out of the 60s. The songs focuses on some of the most serious topics from the 60s. the songs' sounds ranges from psychedilia to rock from pop to a bit of a vaudeville sound. It is a creative and artistic album that has a beautiful sound that can't be impersonated. This album is called the best album of all time vecause of its lyrics and art not becaus e of how many copies it sold. and the customers who gave this album one or two or three stars seem to base on how good the album is by seeing how many copies it sold which is the worst way to criticize on an album.This album is truly great. now let me tell you what the songs mean. the opening track is about a fictional band that the Beatles made up to make the album feel more unique since they were playing as another band and not as the beatles. in the song they present themselves and begin the album. they complement the audience as being a lovely crowd and that they wish they could take the crowd home with them. they also tell about how another band played where they played twenty years ago and on the same day that sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band is playing. they then introduce another character named billy shears who begins the song With A Little Help From My Friends. the song tells about someone asking his/her friends if they would leave him/her if he/she did something wrong. the person also tells how he/she needs his/her friends and the fun he/she has withe his/her friends.the next song Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds tells about someone who lives in a wonderous looking place and about a girl named lucy. the song was inspired by a picture that john lennon's son drew. the song is not about lsd. the next song Getting Better tells about a man who seems to think that before everything was wrong and that nothing went right until he met his girlfriend. he then believes that everything starts to get better after he meets his girlfriend. The next song Fixing A Hole is simply about someone fixing a hole on his house that is causing trouble. She's Leaving Home is a about a girl who yearns to leave the house that she lives in with her parents. and so one day she leaves and the parents are devastated. the parents then begin to try to find out why she left since they trid to give her everything. Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite! is about a man who throws a festival. Within You Without You is about what it would be like if everyone lived in peace. the song has a bit of an Indian sound to it due to the sitar and the bongos. When I'm Sixty Four is about a man who tells about how he feels about aging.Lovely Rita is about a man who trys to win over the heart of a girl named Rita. Good Morning Good Morning is about a man who is ill and is observing the places around him as his life shortens. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise) is where the fictional band returns and tells that the show is over. they also tell that they hope you enjoyed the show. finally the last song is A Day In The Life which is probably on of the best songs from the beatles and of all time. the song begins with a man telling the story of a man who committed scuicide in his car. then there's a big orchestral climax in the middle of the song. the song then begins with another story of a man who is getting ready and is heading to work. this is the greatest album of all time and i would recommend this album to everybody. this album has well written songs as you can see that are written by one of the greatest songwriting teams of all time Lennon-McCartney. Please Buy this album. it will change you. it certainly changed me.
B003SJ4VJ6|4.0|One of Roman Polanski's best. I've seen it three times and it just gets better. The acting, the story, the setting, and the soundtrack are all terrific. Classic Polanksi.
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|Excellent score composed by Howard Shore. For fans of the Lord of the Rings trilogy music this is another great addition.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love Solitaire, and this is definitely the best one out there. It's easy to use and I love the multiplayer mode.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|They changed the formula and not for the better.<br /><br />I still don't understand the movie's premise and I'm willing to bet that the director doesn't either.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I'm in tears. My heart aches for their losses as children, but their love for one another is exquisite and desirable. I can't wait until May.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|To start this game looks odd, then I played it and loved it<br />Buy this game if your into things that work your brain.
0061733199|5.0|Good book. Lots of useful info on many topics. Some sections on certain topics could be more detailed, but I guess that would be a more specialized book. This one covers many topics, and all of them quite well.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Im so sad Im done with this book. I fell in love with the characters. I thought I read good books before but this is beyond good. I never knew  book's could be this good. Im so so happy for Sky and Holder and Karen. God bless you Karen. Im a male in my mid 20's and I been getting tired of romance books, but I can't ever find good books. Is there books as good as this that isn't  Romance?
B009UX2YAC|4.0|my daughter likes this on her kindle fire. We play with it together. I would recommend this top any one.
B008L1DNGI|5.0|Worth the download! Don't miss the free game of the day : )<br />I don't understand why people gave suh a low rating.
B005JZBPHS|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and now im hooked on it, the pricing couldnt have been better
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I liked this book because it was funny and breath taking.l also liked this book because it was awesome  and it did not stay on one topic.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|i have been waiting years to see a movie version of this broadway show.  it was well worth the wait!  i thought that everyone was well cast with the possible exception of russell crowe.  his voice seemed a little thin for the role of javert.<br /><br />my 2 favorite discoveries - wow.  who knew that anne hathaway could sing like THAT?  she was amazing as fantine!  my other favorite discovery was daniel huttlestone who played gavroche.  he was just like i always imagined gavroche would be like.<br /><br />i have seen the broadway version of this show.  at the end of the movie all i could think was that this movie version was like a broadway show on the silver screen.  two thumbs up from me!!<br /><br />***revised 1/6/2013***<br />over the weekend and a friend and i were discussing this movie.  since i had several movie tickets that i needed to use soon i asked her if she wanted to go with me to watch this movie.  she didn't know much about this version but really liked the stage version that she saw in London on the West End.  when we came out she said that this movie is going to win lots of awards and that she agreed with me that anne hathaway was AMAZING as fantine.  two thumbs up from my friend as well.
B008YRVW0I|2.0|I REALLY like this game but is difficult to use on kindle.  other games work much better than this one.
B00A31UXLW|4.0|I really like the way Michael Connelly characters keeps you interested in his stories. I fully recommend this book to anyone that enjoys a really good read.
1423140605|5.0|The Mark of Athena is a great book<br />My daughter read it in less than a week, easy read<br />very fast shipping, thank you<br />highly recommend
B009LY72LQ|4.0|So I have a nine year old who is seriously in love with monster high- I encourage it as much as possible because it has some books that she is willing to struggle through reading. (Admittedly I'm guilty of also adoring the little dolls and it makes play time SO much funner because I enjoy playing as well- and the stories are cute in the books so the books are a big bonus.) Anyhow we LOVE all the little create-a-monster doll sets- but my biggest beef with them is that they come with two dolls- and only one wig! (and only one pair of shoes!) Now this would be perfectly peachy if I could buy more of the little doll wigs elsewhere but as far as I've looked- I cannot. This makes a big big problem because no matter what- it seems I have more dolls than wigs. (also some wigs never seem to actually FIT the head and are continuously popping off- very annoying)<br /><br />My next issue is the ears. These ears make me very very angry. because they clip on rather awkwardly they usually fall off and they NEVER look right- no matter how much you try. I think that I may adjust them and use magnets instead or just glue the silly things on once we have more wigs.<br /><br />Other than that- we LOVE this product! To be honest the little dragon is both our favorites so I've had to get more than one of pack for us. I'm just crossing my fingers they get a little unicorn gal out eventually! (and a wig or shoe pack!) I really wanted the updo wig that they showed on the cover of the pack- it would be super awesome if they started releasing it!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Courageous DVD<br />very fast shipping, thank you<br />a Great faith based movie, wished they made more like this<br />came in great condition<br />HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this app is really cool it is awesome because it makes you think and it is very ocupieing for all.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I downloaded this game to occupy my grandson in the car on a road trip.  Turned out the whole family was eagerly waiting for their turn!!
0345803485|5.0|ordered this book as a gift for my Aunt. She had been wanting to read the series, I have, so I thought it would be nice to get them for her and send them her way!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|So convenient and easy to use!  Much easier to post items for sale than having to log in to my desktop.  Love Ebay and this app!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great game and really enjoy the auto move functionality.  Fast shuffle and clear graphics make it a fun hand to play every time.
B00846REIS|4.0|Very closely resembles characters and situations in fifty shades of gray<br /><br />Just enough difference to keep me interested. Good read
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was exciting from beginning to end... i keep telling myself what will happen between our two main characters.. although we all knows how it will end, the author keeps us hooked by adding in a few twist and turns before the grand finale. this was an excellently written novel and i would recommend to everyone!
B000JQU1VS|5.0|This is excellent reading for the avid Holmes fan!  However,there are some stories with overlapping points and plots.  Still the Holmes fan will not be disappointed and may gain insight into the background of a sleuth who may only be known to them through recent film.
B0045XGRQE|4.0|Just as good as the first Iron Man - action, adventure and enough decent dialog to keep grown-ups entertained. Even the bad guy is a hipster.
B0096CDG0O|1.0|Rolls the exact same dice 3 straight turns. Which is impossible.  If you need 10 on 5's... you will rarely get 1... 4 straight rolls (bonus roll) &amp; didn't roll a single 5? This happens every single game.  Complete waste of time
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Original Kindle cable went bad, this works as a replacement, it is smaller and lighter then the original cable but the price was good.
0446547573|5.0|I would DEFINITELY recommend buying this book if you are a fan of Nicholas Spark's but if you tend to dislike his writing I would suggest you look for another book to read .
B0002TJGQS|5.0|They work well in our various variety of Christmas candles, batteries seem to last for quite awhile & LED's are bright.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This game is a fun game!  Sometimes very challenging, but fun!  I put it on my kindle Fire and can play it anywhere.
B00846REIS|5.0|Couldn't put it down. What a great read. It's similar to 50 shades but more mature, and believable for a girl In her mid 20s.
B0079R8KXG|4.0|It is cool looking, it is tough, I love being able to prop it up on my desk or kitchen counter while listening to audio books.
B00866JL96|5.0|I LOVE Zach Efron, and I am almost 30. However, I was worried about this movie because I have never seen him act and I really didn't hear anything good about this movie. One day, it was rainy so I figured I would watch it! OH MY GOSH, not only do I believe that Zach can act and is not just something pretty to look at, it was a great love story. There was so much drama, tears and even some humor! I bought this for my sister in law for Christmas and she loved it as well. Amazon had it for a great price and I knew she would love it!
1582406723|5.0|Yeah the story is a bit different than the show, but it's a good read and worth collecting as I haven't collected comics since I was a kid.  I wish I would've known about the compedium's especially since they are up to vol. 17 or 18, but since I started on the single volumes I'll just slowly work my way up.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|It is a great app. I really enjoy playing it to pass the time. I play it on my kindle and it works just fine.<br />.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was really good, and i liked the part where Gregory screamed in front of the girl, when he thought she had chicken pocs, but it was really just a pimple!
B000067FP8|5.0|Great movie. I love this old time movie with the little gremlins. thank you, I could watch this all the time now I oun it.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|She read the book but never got to see the movie in theaters - if you liked either of those, this is worth the money (her words, not mine).
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I bought this for my husband for Christmas and we watched 5 episodes in two days. It is veery well done.
B003Y5H57E|5.0|Great movie - my fiance and I saw it in theaters. Nice how the characters and storyline seem to be on different paths and then come together at the end (similar to the Valentine's Day and New Year's Eve movies). I don't normally like Steve Carrell but he is good in this movie. Emma Stone is good as always, as is Julianne Moore. Kevin Bacon makes a funny smaller appearance.
B009VB998I|5.0|Great fun family movie.<br />My 8 year old daughter loved it.<br />Great quality HD as well.<br /><br />Right up there with a blu ray movie.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|If you liked the movies by the individual characters, this is worth buying. Let's face it, though - you've already seen it and you're gonna buy it.
B0097PW7H8|5.0|love the ease of use. helps me get the most out of my device. no guessing on how long your battery will last
B0053O89XI|5.0|TBBT just keeps getting better and better, and season 5 continued that trend. Even if you've only seen syndicated reruns, you should buy this - it's a must watch! Probably one of the best shows on TV.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I rate this book a whopping 5 stars. It was fantastic - wonderful plot, excellent character development. Although the storyline was one we've seen many times, I thought Collins reinvented the idea in a truly spectacular way. I read this book again after I finished the series, and it was by far my favorite of the three. The other two were almost sickeningly romantic, and to me, it appeared Collins was going for the Twilight-popularized over-the-top love triangle. All in all, The Hunger Games is a magnificent novel, a must-read for young and old adults and certainly an eye-opener for all.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I read all the books in the series, and I love Jennifer Lawrence as an actor. I had to watch it at home after seeing it in theaters, where some parts of it didn't quite click for me. Obviously, there are parts of the book that were removed for the movie, but as a separate form of media, this does a good job.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Awsome no long explanations this is one of the best books ever<br />The third wheel is an epic conclusion to this series.
B002ZG99TK|4.0|This movie didn't garner a lot of critical acclaim but I thought it was great. A must have for any Densel Washington fan!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Works great and harder than I thought but really fun to play the different seasons. I am hooked! Playing is addicting!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If you haven't tried this series because of the zombies in it, like I skipped if till now - know this, it's NOT really about the zombies, any  more than Breaking Bad is only about meth.  They are incidental to the human story.  And right about time you think you have a handle on the story, something happens and you never saw THAT coming!
B00821PCJS|3.0|Unfortunately this isn't going to be one of those shows that takes you to another place. It's just another show, but if you are wanting to watch something to pass the time then it's okay. I was hoping it would be original and something that I couldn't wait to watch the next episode.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I'm absolutely head over heels for the book!! I can't wait for the next one! Couldn't believe the  end! Keep it  up!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A great game that is very fun and addicting. I was playing on it for quite a whole trying to pass a bunch of challenging levels. And the best part is that it' s free!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I read this book I was already in tears. All this romance, deaths, and sadness was to much to handle. I am 10 years old and I found this book amazing. I loved the way Suzanne described Katniss so unsure of her love for Petta and him being a lovely romantic. I strongly advise this book to anyone who wants to read it. Can't wait to see the movie!!!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Bag keeps camera very secure and there are enough pockets for everything. We really hope the quality is as good as the functionality.
B00846REIS|4.0|So, I finished this book in 4 days..so NOT like me!!  My 1st romance/passion/raunchy/sexy etc book, and I actually enjoyed it.  I found myself wondering what next. Some questions I had while reading were never answered and I guess that's ok!!!<br /> Have to say too, reading makes me tired. I don't read much at a time. BUT my Kindle Fire changed that!!
B002P76CJ4|5.0|It's Lynyrd Skynyrd what else is there to say. I loved the entire album,it started with the kick a$$ song Sill Unbroken and kept on kicking it through the whole album. If you love skynyrd this CD is a must.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My daughter downloaded this game and finds it extremely entertaining.  It's free so what more can you ask for from a game?
B008FDP7AW|5.0|It's Lynyrd Skynyrd what else is there to say. I loved the entire album, great songs and great music. If you love skynyrd you have to get this album.
B005XQLBU4|2.0|It was fine for a bit, but after four levels and the realization that there are but a few upgrades and enemies, with none to unlock after that, I uninstalled. Maybe I am holding it to a higher standard than others, but I would not spend money on it. Good thing I got it on sale.
B0013D6N68|5.0|If you crank up the volume and close your eyes, you feel like you are right in the middle of the greatest jam session in history. I loved hearing the guys joke around and talk about various things while playing some of their hits.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|I enjoy using this app, simply for the spectacle of swirling dots in a void. The app itself is pleasant enough, providing the expected options, but it lacks, something. I love exploring settings within an app and finding something unexpected, and that sadly didn't happen here.
B003Y5H5BA|4.0|This movie is hilarious! I love Channing Tatum and seeing the cameos by the actors from the original TV series.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|This app is probably fine when performance is compared to Fire OS apps, it is probably fine when you are connected to the internet at all times, and it is likely fantastic when the lockscreen controls glitch out and flash repeatedly. Yet, when it lags, force quits because you are out of mobile range, and refuses to work with 4.2 lockscreens, I am forced to find a new player. For downloading music, however, there is no competitor in either selection or ease.
B0041KKYGU|5.0|This movie is SO funny and all of the actors are fabulous! As a teacher, I see the reality in a few things and the hilarity of the whole movie.
B0089Q1TPM|5.0|Classic movie!  Our 10 year old loves it and watches it constantly.  (He's also a huge star wars fan)  It's still fun to watch and aged well.
0525478817|5.0|This book ... is... first of all, it's amazing. I saw it so many times and finally today, i decided to read it since it was so short. It has changed my life and i am not even finished with it. I've known so many people with cancer and it's made me change how i look at even them. I laughed and cried during this book and it's because its real. It's the kind of book that makes you feel. I see why its on the list of best books of 2012. It's definitely worthy of the claim. I would recommend this book to everyone.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I've never read a book so captivating and suspenseful. It was recommended to me by my librarian and I decided to buy it and I am so glad I did. This book is a life changer.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Very well written on a sensative subject.  The characters were clearly visible and touching.  I recommend this book to my book club.
0142420891|4.0|I ordered this for my granddaughter and really don't know much about it, but it came on time and was delivered directly to her.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|It was hard to relate to thought process of the teens.  The outcome of the trial seemed very unrealistic on several levels, but very well written.  It was to much for me to believe that there was No legal punishment at all.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this app is just amazing. BUT they could really put more blocks and items. but otherwise this app is GREAT!<br /><br />I REALLY recommend this app
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Loved this series. It seemed to me like a lost ancient world.  Could have been earth in earlier lost times. So much detail to the different kingdoms, the ruling families and histories.  The author has a great and complex mind.  I am hoping for book six for continuation or a conclusion that will bri g it all together and knock iff some of the dasterdly characters :-)
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I like this app because it displays when the power cord is working so I don't have to worry about the green light turning orange on my Kindle. It displays a power cord picture to let me know when my Kindle recognizes that the cord is plugged in. If you have any trouble getting your Kindle to charge this app saves time and head aches.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Great way to unwind and not have to think!<br />My 7 year old love the game as much as mommy!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I watched the movie first, however the book is so much more detailed and all around better (like usual). I am definitely reading the restof the trilogy!
B007LB1O3I|5.0|Madonna is still doing it. She has been in the game for 30 years. My favorite joint is Girl gone Wild!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I purchase this game for my 7 year old daughter. When I played it myself, I couldn't stop. If you decided to chose another character you will have another fee.
0525953728|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  You get an account of what life is like for a Navy Seal.  We know they are out there doing thier job but I never really thought about all the training and disipline and sacrifice required to do this job.
B008XZKSKG|1.0|IMHO the remaster of these records was well, awful. This is great music, don't get me wrong, but my initial listen to some of the records is really really disappointing. I had read the corresponding equivalent cd's sounded bad, but the previous review encouraged me to buy this set. To me, the treble sounds really harsh, the middle base sounds peak (upper base boosted). Disappointing. Great songs though, and I didn't have the vinyl though which could give one a reason to buy these...
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Hard to put down...Clancy keeps the storyline moving and no one is better at telling a story than he is
B008AK8FHM|3.0|&#34;Proof&#34; at its lowest level is &#34;more probable than not&#34;.  This interesting, but fanciful story comes no where near reaching this minimal level.  Many Lives, Many Masters (Brian Weiss) comes much closer to proving that physical death is not necessarily the &#34;end&#34;,<br /><br />One problem is that nothing here can be verified. The &#34;science&#34; is that we have a typically arrogant Doctor, who because he is a doctor, considers his perceptions as equal to repeatable experiment which is real science.  Not only can this not be repeated, it can't even be verified, other than the illness itself.<br /><br />I purchased this in part, large part, because of the use of the word proof in the title.  This was deceptive marketing. If the good doctor would deceive readers with his title, why would I believe the rest of his story.  At least Dr. Weiss had repeatable, and multiple &#34;experiments&#34;.<br /><br />This is not to say the story is impossible.  Just nothing to say it's accurate either.  No one knows everything there is know about the functioning of the human brain.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Amy and Nick, married, both out of work, move to a small town in Missouri ... that's not where it ends, just gets more involved from that point.  As I read further into the story, I just could not put this book down. I don't want to give too much away, but one of the characters is totally diabolical.  Some people may not appreciate the ending, however, I thought it was a good fit considering the Amy and Nick characters.<br /><br />This is the first time I've read any of Gillian Flynn's work.  Enjoyed her style and will definitely read more of her books.
0061733199|5.0|Great book overall. This book has alot in it and covers different scenarios of every sort. From packing emergency equipment, to how to build makeshift tents, what foods in nature you can eat, etc.., etc.  I bought it because i plan on going long hiking trips and definetly learned alot of usefull things. Now i have to go out and try them, wish me luck.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|I wasn't sure about the website at first, but after I started using it I was impressed. Now that I am able to take it with me on the go, it is even better. A must for today professionals.
B000Q6GUTI|4.0|Saw this at the movie; great couples movie. Men will like the action and women will like the lean Mark Wahlberg
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Love it, great for kids and adults<br />My daughter got me hooked on this game. Every since I can't t put it down.
B00846REIS|5.0|Just as good as fifty shades of grey. But this had more romance and struggle like a semi normal relationship. It wasn't as \\"hot\\" as fifty shades. But I didn't mind it at all. can't wait to read the next book.
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|Very fun unless you are a professional piano player, which I am not.  You can choose the level of play and the songs are fun to listen to.  I liked this app a lot.  I have had no negative events on my Kindle Fire.  If you like to fiddle around with a piano once in a while you would probably like this app as much as I do.  Great for kid!  Keeps them busy and they learn from playing.  My thanks to the creator of the app.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|In the last year I have read this book four times, and I will probably keep rereading it. The prose in this book is phenomenal. The varied style and unique politely me engaged from the moment I picked it up. I stayed up until almost 4 in the morning the first time I read it just so I could finish. It has action, comedy, romance, drama, and 80's references out the Wazoo. I would recommend this book to anyone who can read, plain and simple.
0525478817|5.0|The Fault in Our Stairs is a breathtaking novel.  I laughed, I cried, I experienced, I learned, and, ultimately, I was changed: what more could I -- or anyone -- ask for?
B0086700CM|4.0|Great fun for adults and kids and everyone in between! Only thing I didn't like is that we wanted to reset everything and start over and we are having a difficult time figuring out how to do that.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Love this mini series! Order arrived promptly and in good quality. Purchased this as a Christmas present for my fiancee and he loved it! The bundle with The Pacific was a really good deal.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My daughter was instantly addicted to this app and plays it every time I set down my Kindle Fire. It keeps you updated as quest items finish.
B002UNMWAG|5.0|What more can I say about this film other than it is a must to see if you liked the original seek it out if you can get it for $5 of less...
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|ive been looking for a game like wow or lol. this one is hard to figure out or lvl up. i like to stay with one character but in this u got to use other ones as well. dk if i like that. but i will keep trying to figure this one
B004OEIL5E|5.0|I loved Scream 2 when it came out I went to the theater twice to see it I do believe that it was that good to pay for it twice if you ask me and getting the Blu ray for $6.00 I said why not!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|A psychological thriller that left my hands shaking from hearing the fearful truth of marriage and gender roles. It left me wondering about who I pretend to be in my own marriage, and enormously grateful for being normal and boring.
B000Q67876|5.0|This is the movie to own if you haven't seen it then stop living under a rock and go seek it out for the blu ray book price I got it for which was at $7.99 so no excuses get it and see it stop reading this and get it now!!!
B0092QITO2|4.0|I never buy a disc unless I have already seen and liked the movie and if I already have it on a Standard Def DVD, and checked to see if the upgrade to blu ray is a significant improvement.  So this will be my first quality review of a blu ray DVD for which I never saw the film.  I received it as a holiday gift and watched it last night for the first time as the extended version.  Yes, there are many similarities between this remake and the original, which I have seen many times and still love, but I took this as a wholly different film.<br /><br />Enough folk here have discussed the differences and similarities of the film and voiced their opinions on the plot, acting and relevance so I only will provide a view of the quality of the Blu Ray film for both audio and video.<br /><br />The audio is the big star of this film as its True HD 5.1 fully utilizes the entire front and back sound stages and completely envelopes you in the action with excellent and appropriate use of the LFE sub channel and discreet directionality for all the surround channels. Actually, the audio may sometimes envelop you too much during some of the strongest action scenes, at least, that is what I felt.  The audio level is set higher than most so if you have a standard volume set that you usually use, you might need to notch it down but, either way, you won't find any complaints from me regarding this uncompressed audio.<br /><br />The video is very good and is signified by a cool color grading very similar to that used in iRobot.  There is excellent details in the dark and shadow areas as there should be since so much of this film was CGI, but there was no grain, artifacts or aliasing that I could see.  While you may have complaints about the film itself, you will not have complaints regarding either the audio or video.<br /><br />There are a ton of extras though I haven't watched them all as yet so no comment that would make a difference.<br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thankss only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great read. Well written.  This is a true survival story for all ages. A true story of the kind of love we all deserve
B000RZIGYU|5.0|This is the one to have in HD and now it is available on Blu ray but I bought a HDDVD player and it was cheap so I bought it but when my player stops working then I will have to buy it on Blu I guess but it is a must see so please see it!!!
B00756GKBA|4.0|I hesitated to write a review on this for sometime because I couldn't decide to give this 3 or 4 stars. I finally decided on 4. If we look at what Madonna has been capable of I would only have given it 3 but it is a little unfair to judge new material based on the work they did before. Overall, while not a great CD it is good and there are a few highlights that make it worth the purchase.<br /><br />\\"Girl Gone Wild\\", \\"Gang Bang\\", and \\"Give me all your Lovin\\" are very good pop songs that you would expect from Madonna. She proves in these 3 songs that she can still sound good and fresh and up to date. \\"Superstar\\" and \\"Masterpiece\\" are also good. Nothing you will remember in 10 years to be honest but you will enjoy them while they are playing. Those 5 songs are the highlights and help to make up for a pretty good CD. The other songs on the first disc are just \\"ok\\" to be honest. They are done well but there is not much in them to make you want to get the CD back out. Since Madonna has such a proven track record I can easily understand why some fans were dissapointed. Again, good but not as good as she is capable of doing. The extra \\"2nd\\" disc is a nice surprise. While nothing to get overly excited about it is a nice addition and kinda helps to make up for what the 1st disc lacked. Overall, if you buy this CD you will enjoy but this will not go down as a masterpiece in pop/rock music.
B0089BSM70|5.0|This is the best that you are ever going to see this movie because if you have the Universal release keep it for the Terror in the Isles but if you don't have that release already than get this one because it is packed with features galore!
B009D0LBRO|1.0|For whatever reason..though the NABI 2 has the same architecture as the Nexus 7, this game WILL NOT work on the NABI 2. It will stay stuck on the start screen.
B004OEIL54|5.0|If you like horror then you have to own this movie because if you don't already own this movie then I don't think that you are the horror fan that you claim to be so best be getting this for sure!!
055357342X|4.0|I recommend this series if you're into Knights and Kings and murder and intrigue.<br /><br />Don't want to give away any spoilers, but book number 3 is very &#34;OMG WHAT?!&#34; inducing.
B000O179EA|5.0|The movie it's self is great there is not much that I can say about it that has not already been said so check it out if you have a HDDVD Player and can get the HDDVD for cheap then grab it but if you can get the Blu ray for cheap then grab that one instead...
B007BVMVDU|3.0|This is a decent series, but it does not do the books justice. I watched it because I loved the books and heard so many rave reviews about the series. As usual, the books were way better, but the series is enjoyable none the less
B000W9DSVW|5.0|The movies are great the actors are top notch what more can I say that hasn't already been said with all the special features and for the $9.99 price how could anyone say no?
0345803485|1.0|That's honestly all I have to say about this book. Twilight with porn. Maybe slightly better written than twilight, but that isn't saying much.<br /><br />If you liked twilight, you'll probably enjoy it. If you thought Twilight was droll, dont' get this.
B000E5KJE8|1.0|the HDDVD that I received didn't work for me when I pop it into the player it said wrong format or something like that..
B003L77G2Y|5.0|I bought this movie so i had something to watch while i healed after surgery.  It is a good series, but very addicting,,, ample warning
B004OEIL5O|5.0|I don't know why people always give this movie s*** but they do but I love all of them and when I got mine for only $6.00 Why not?
B000AM2L1O|5.0|I was so impressed with the softness of this baby doll. It was a Christmas gift for my grandbaby, who is learning to dress and tie....the baby was perfect.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I like playing solitaire, but those stupid ads keep popping up after each hand.  Why would you allow and do all the &#34;free&#34; games allow that.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Great music group love the bluesy sounds. The album sound is haunting and it's been in permanent rotation in our house.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|Excellent video, good packaging and price.  BUT the Bu Ray case has broken upper and lower inner flanges and even worse the hinge pins for EVERY disc page are broken.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|the case was broken when i recieved it and it was not the same as one i purchased from the phone store. the thickness of the product was different. Not a knockoff but different, not sure.....
B009KHCT94|4.0|In this homage to Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, bumbling Nazi's interact with a corrupt US political system to create a hilarious but very dark comedy.  Littered with stereotypes that are guaranteed to be offensive to just about everyone,  the story line is unpredictable enough to overlook cheesy special effects and gaping plot holes.  Strongly recommended for anyone that liked Catch 22 or Monty Python.
B000OW77UU|5.0|This movie is always a good movie to remember success doesn't always come easy.  It is a feel good movie that always raises my &#34;I can&#34; attitude, and that anything is possible.
B0096BIENY|5.0|I love Il Divo and this CD is amazing.  The new songs are wonderful and their voices are amazing!  I highly recommend this CD.
B004EKCNMA|5.0|This movie is great, the animation  was amazing!  The story of the Christmas Carol never changes, so it was good in two respects the story was good and the animation made it even better.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I got this free at one point (it was the free amazon app of the day), and enjoyed playing it for a while. But my phone had a problem and had to be factory reset. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to re-install the app for free though, which I was disappointed by. I assumed that since Amazon had it on record that I had already downloaded it once, it would allow me to reinstall it, but it didn't...it would have required me to &#34;re-buy&#34; it, which I did not want to do. Especially considering that now I knew if it ever happened again, I would be required to re-buy it every time.
B000T46O52|5.0|I have always wanted to see this movie, and I happened to find it in my kindle.  The beliefs of the times have come a long ways with respect of gays, lesbians and AIDS.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|This 2-disc special does in fact contain the bonus features, extended/deleted scenes and such. Great movie at a great price.
B0026O475M|5.0|I have seen this movie several times, and it continues to be a good movie.  Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors, so this is another movie that is a must see.  There is a stretch in the movie that there little to no speaking, and Tom Hanks does a great job with his body language to tell us a story.  Only a great actor can pulled that off with the grace and skill that only Tom Hanks can.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|sucks slave market bulls***wrapped as people friendly jajaja what the baloney boobie capitalism is nothing more that a live time of debt
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a cool game. I have played just about all hidden object games from the Amazon app. Store and this one is one of the best.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|Having fun and enjoying game but in the future will get ad-free version.  Would recommend game to friends and family.
B001QXCYZY|5.0|I ordered this mic like a year ago. i was kinda scared about the low price , i thought i was gonna get so cheap mic but i didnt. i got some $300 quality for about 60 bucks . if your thinking about buying it go ahead , you wont regret it . I PROMISE !
B000ZMVAXO|5.0|Great amplifier by it's price, enhanced my tone and sound of my Les Paul.<br />Great metal sound . Get Slinky's strings and you're done.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|This movie was pretty good. It didnt seem over the top and had great action scenes. An interesting take on Abraham's life. I need to read the book.
B000L53D4O|4.0|I purchased this to help my nephew learn to walk better and he loves it.  I like the fact that it can be used as just a toy once he is comfortable walking.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Facebook on kindle only shows about 10 friend status at the most. Not able to see any past friend status
B000F9RB8K|4.0|Very good movie with lots of beautiful scenary to see on the blueray version. It is a little long, but gives you something to do on those cold winter days.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Hi,my name is yasmin I love this dictionary it gives you all the information you need and when I say  it gives you all the information  you needI mean everything BABY.
1410419274|5.0|Something different from your everyday life. &#60;3 it, I highly recommended this. A lot better then the teenage vampire stuff.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think this game is awesome you run up and down side to side running away from hungry monkies.  You can go to the store and buy cool characters and different skills.  I think this game should be $14.00 not free.awesomeness!!!!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Great game for free. To many ads, but you can put up with them for a free game. The game itself is addicting and alot of fun. I give it the thumbs up.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Good book. Ending not as expected. Would recommend to anyone who likes Nicholas Sparks. Brought a tear or two in the end.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I like this game, I got it for my tablet because I loved it so much on my smart phone.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Amazing. Such a sad ending with all the deaths in this final book, but I am glad Peeta and Katniss ended up together.
8866131385|5.0|love love love this planner.  I've tried other ones but I always come back to this one. Wish it was only 12 months but oh well :)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is purely mystery, love, courage, connection and new found hope. Like nothing I've ever read. I love it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I don't care how poorly written this book may or may not be.  E L never claims to be an experienced author.  After a 3 year battle with infertility and finally having a 2 year old, my husband and I had lost the spark in the bedroom to say the least.  I read all three books in this series and then shared all of my favorite parts with my hubby, which was darn near the entire three books, and I don't want to say it saved our marriage, but it totally helped us get the spark back. So, thanks E L James!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This program is incredibly useful.  It's so convenient to be able to access this on my phone.  Great for being on the go.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This is a really cute game. If you like cut the rope, you will like pudding monsters. Just as addicting, too.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|One of the best action series out there and the story is amazing!! I love my bluray copy and will continue to watch them monthly! lol :)
B005MMY534|5.0|Was always curious about this series.. I'm loving it!! Can't wait to watch Season 2. I love the different twist they put on the characters and the storyline.
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|I must admit, I was more than a little pleasantly surprised about how captivating the characters and the story were, despite a relatively slow start. The backstories proved heartbreaking, their sad histories informing each character's actions and impacting how they viewed their world, and each other. Minnie and Robert captured my heart, they most certainly will capture yours.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Deserves all 5 stars_ easy and light read that you can not put down. If you are looking for a book that makes you reminisce and laugh out loud this is it.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I think that if someone who is wanting something accurate to say or do that they should read THE NEW OXFORD AMERICAN DICTIONARY
B002M87W2W|4.0|Meet Me In St Louis is a must see musical classic.  The acting and the songs are unforgettable.  Especially Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|And I am a big fan. Dr. Alexander's account especially coming from his clinical, scientific knowledge of the brain was quite compelling, especially his &#34;conversion&#34; to being a &#34;believer&#34; after this experience. I think it's a must read for everybody interested in this subject OR who has ever had a loved one pass away.
B004P98QZ8|5.0|Lego makes great products; hours of fun and looks great completed.<br />My son still enjoy the dragon and the Temple is amazing.
B004478GNI|4.0|I waited until the last minute to get this so I paid about $10 too much.  Silly me.  However, it was as advertised.  My 6 y/o loves it and we had fun putting it together.
B0015AARJI|5.0|The corded version forces you to sit about 3 feet from the screen. This model allows you the room to appreciate the graphics and may even improve game playing. Price was good too!
0345803507|5.0|bought sequel after buying the first book- definately needed to continue with the next shades and they got double duty
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|After reading some great reviews about the movie, I decided to rent it via Amazon.  This is a great movie with good acting and story line.  I always like seeing movies with happy ending, so this is right up my alley.  Christian Bale and Anne Hathaway looked good together.  I didn't see the first 2, so some of the plots I couldn't understand. I ended up watching the first two.  Rating the trilogy, I have to say it like this one the best out of the three, then &#34;Batman begins&#34;, then &#34; The Dark Knight&#34; (only because I was so freaking scared of Heath Ledger...He was so good at it that I couldn't watch some of the scenes...LOL!)...I'm going to get a whole set of the 3 movies on DVD, so I see them again. Good movie...
0345803493|5.0|yes somewhat provacative but entertaining and does make you want to get on with the story passed them all on to daughter who saw them while visiting-wow mother!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Enjoying the hell outta this. Mahjong is my favorite matching game. I always have to have it on my devices.
0525953728|5.0|bought it read it and then passed it on as Christmas gift-not dissapointed in the content-good reading- buy it for enlightnment
B005HSG3VK|4.0|Loved how lightweight it was and it was here before Christmas. My daughter loved the bright color and the strap to hold it on
B0019N8P2W|4.0|Honestly when I got this I felt like I'd received a ripped version off ebay. The case insert looked cheap, the DVD print had a homemade quality look to it. However, there's nothing wrong with the DVDs themselves, and that was my whole purpose in purchasing them. I don't know if that's just the way they made them or if I got a bad copy. But like I said, nothing wrong with the media, so I'm happy. And this is a great show! If you liked making fun of the jocks and populars in high school, you're going to love this show. Plus there's usually great '90s music on every episode.
B005FOENYK|1.0|I have not received my shipment.  Polar Bear, Polar Bear (Book & CD Set) ordered over a month ago. Please check.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Bought as a gift for my 11 year old daughter, huge Taylor Swift fan, and it was a huge hit. Great songs, no worries on which songs are appropriate for her to listen to as they are all well intended and have good messages for young women. I highly highly recommend.

B003A9OVS0|5.0|This album proves the Gorillaz are still one of the best music makers out there. Also it is Ent friendly.
1451695195|1.0|Very disappointing. When describing the girl with whom he was flying through the air, he doesn't mention whether or not she has big boobs.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Amazing story that depicts the importance of overcoming your fears and surviving by any means. Can't wait to watch the movie.
B0090SI3ZW|2.0|Sometimes I just want to let myself go and watch mindless violence, blood, and gore.  Not the type in horror movies, but the action flicks of the Far East or the Italian western genre, like The Raid.  However I do like some story with this, not much of a story, but something.  Oh yes, I need to be able to hear and understand what the characters are saying, no matter how stupid it maybe.  You know the basics.<br /><br />The Man with the Iron Fists has the mindless violence and yes the blood and the gore, but after that I don't know what the hell is going on.<br /><br />We have a fat Russel Crowe who has a knife/gun thing and some very interesting moves in the bedroom.  He also has some very interesting \\"tools\\" he uses there too.  There is Lu who runs a cat house and is something of a woman's libber in China.  She does a lot with the \\"wave\\" of her hand.  There is this black man who is a blacksmith[huh?] who looses his \\"touch with reality\\" and then puts on metal hands.  Then there are the Asian gentlemen, one has deadly clothes[ I kid you not], another runs around with a very bad hair day, and some goofy guy with a blow gun. Oh yes the metal guy he was cool.<br /><br />Mix in a lot of gold, crazy prositutes, a strange \\"brother and sister\\" act, and throw it up on the screen with current music and pray you have a movie.  Forget about a story that makes sense, or explains anything, forget about being able to hear the crappy dialogue, just sit back and watch the pretty people fly through the air, heads explode, throats ripped out, a flying eye ball or two.<br /><br />As you have noticed a lot people have just praised this movie to high heaven, well good for them, for me it still sucks!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This is very helpful  if  I do not know a word i can tap the word on my kindle and it tells me and you can go back very quickly to where you left off.

B000N3ST9I|5.0|This is brutal, savage, willfully difficult. It can feel like an excersice straining the listeners ability to absorb punishment.  I mean this as an advocate.  A hammer blow and cathartic.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I never leave to do a run without it.  I have used it to monitor my times and it has helped enormously when I was training for my first 1/2 marathon. I was able to keep my desired pace throughout.

B005IZLPMY|5.0|Great price and quick delivery.  Creative writing, fun characters and fine performances. I must say that seeing it once was enough for me.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|I'll admit that my first impression of this song wasn't immediately love, however after the U.S. Swim Team made their faux video and every radio station and television channel on the planet started playing it incessantly, it really grew on me. Now everytime I hear it, I smile. Great memories, watching the London Olympics and getting to know the fantastic athletes that represented our country. Sentimental or not, I can't seem to get enough of the fun beat and catchy chorus.
B009EDZB6C|2.0|The video stopped playing and turned into a black screen twice while we were watching the video.  It would be nice to get a refund.  Thank you.
B0032JTV6U|4.0|Glee is a great show - sassy and unapologetic, with outrageous characters and fantastic covers. I am not a fan of cover songs myself, but I love almost every song Glee does as much if not more than the originals. As a big Journey fan, I think they rock Journey songs, as they do many of the other artists they take on. The guest stars are a bonus treat. You should start at the beginning, as Season 1 was fantastic with the most honest take on each of the characters that we'll ever see.
B0086700CM|5.0|My husband and I both enjoy playing this game on our Kindle.  It moves very fast and the graphics are really good.

B0078ZTWP4|5.0|Okay I purchased this and 2 other lanterns the other two lanterns were Rayovac and very close to the same look as this one.  I figured I liked the Rayovac but this cost less and who knows maybe it is better.  First off this lantern has the tiny find me in the dark setting just like the Rayovac.  It has the high setting and the low setting but wait there is more it has a strobe setting in which the highest setting flashes quickly it would be very good for changing a flat tire.  Use one to see what you are doing and set the other one to strobe to warn cars that you are on the road.<br /><br />  Both take 3x  'd' sized batteries.  This one comes in a box with clear instructions as to how to load the batteries and close the case. The rayovac did not have the instructions.<br /><br /> Both let you pull the clear  top and hang it upside down but the tiny hook for hanging is a piece of cheap plastic so do not do it. This lantern has a single bright led.  The rayovac has 3 leds.  This is the brighter light on high setting. The rayovac has a better top handle it is metal as is this one but the rayovac has a rubber coating on the handle.<br /><br /> The Rayovac on high setting lasted 49 hours and then slowly but surely  dimmed amazingly it is 96 hours and the rayovac on high setting still has some light. Since it claims 40 hours on high and 90 hours  on low I do not know if this one can match it. Still the strobe is useful.  Both lanterns feature the tiny blinking find me light I estimate this will force a yearly battery change like a smoke detector does. I highly recommend buying one of each.  I will get back with the staying power on this light's high setting.<br /><br /> I USED EVEREADY GOLD ALKALINE  Date of 03-2015  I purchased the package Dec of 2011.

B008ELUEQC|2.0|Years ago, my wife liked Rod's recording of 'Hot Legs&#34;, so, I bought her the album.<br />When I saw this recording advertised on television, I decided it was time to add to<br />my wife;s Stewart collection.
0763650447|4.0|We loved borrowing this book from the library so much, we asked for it for Christmas. But this version is didn't different! The \\"gripy\\" fish is now \\"grumpy\\" so the book doesn't rhyme completely (even though this line is quoted in the product description). While small, the change is puzzling and bothers the boys (and me, too).
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Good product and excellent , I recommend it place and product<br />I like it , interest book<br />It is wonderfull
B0085P2Z6E|2.0|The challenges in this game are pretty boring and all too similar. From what I have seen through 7 levels (multiple challenges per level) you have three types of puzzles; 1) find these objects on the screen, 2) find the differences  between 2 images, 3) rotate blocks to create an image. All three types of game are very simple and don't challenge you to think. Pretty much force you to stare at the screen. Don't waste your time.
B0055QYKQO|2.0|The motherboard looks smart, operates mostly as one would expect from an enthusiast board.<br /><br />The bundled applications look cheap, tacky and annoying as ever, although the integrated BIOS update is fairly easy and effective to use.<br /><br />BIOS comes with many options overclockers and system tweakers will love, even though the documentation for said features leaves a great deal to be desired.<br /><br />Here's where the good stuff ends and the bad stuff begins;<br /><br />VRM/MOSFETS get ridiculously hot.  They get painfully hot to the touch to the point I'm considering ordering a laser thermometer just to keep an eye on them.  Unfortunately the UD3, being the lowest-end board, doesn't seem to have many options for aftermarket cooling other than some discontinued Thermalright products.<br /><br />The heatsinks on the board are wholly inadequate for the task of cooling these components.<br /><br />They were quite bad running a little Phenom X4 965... but running an FX 8350 makes me concerned for the boards longetivity to the point I'm convinced Gigabyte have a design issue that they have failed to issue a product recall for.<br /><br />They are SO bad that I'm actually afraid to attempt overclocking my processor, because even though it's been bandied about by Gigabyte tech support that 90 Celcius is an acceptable temperature for these components, I feel that temperatures that high are indicative of something being seriously wrong.<br /><br />Disregarding the obvious issues with heat-related degradation in the affected components themselves, there's also the issue of heat pollution from these components affecting the case ambient temperature.  I am using a Corsair 800D case with almost all the case fan slots in use, and I am still concerned at the perceived high temperature of the exhaust.<br /><br />Based on this issue, I can't possibly recommend this motherboard.  Spend the extra cash and go for a board with better components, because I really don't trustthis board (I own a rev 1.1) to last long.
B0067TGSOK|4.0|As someone who already started a business on a dime, I didn't find too much new information in this book. That said, I have recommended it strongly to some friends who are stuck in a rut and want to find a way to pursue their passion and make money at it without borrowing money or sinking their entire savings into the project. For people like that, I think it's a great book.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|Sit back and enjoy another Donald Fagen classic Solo album filled with mellow, funky grooves and funny/biting lyric as is the norm for Mr. Fagen. I prefer his solo works to Steely Dan stuff and after 2 listens to this album I am already comparing it to his Masterpiece and one of he greatest albums EVER . . .The Nightfly
B005I4JG80|4.0|I had a good chuckle discussing this book with my French friends, who were like &#34;Bien sur!&#34; when I told them some of the author's main points. A lot of what's in the book as &#34;French&#34; is universal common sense to my mind, but not to many, it would seem. I am tempted to give this book as a gift to some of my friends who have lost control over their children, but that might not go over so well. I definitely plan to give it to some who are pregnant, but haven't yet given birth. :)
B005LF9OCE|5.0|downloaded and watched great season and great way to catch up on what you miss when you have a life...lol
0823013626|5.0|A beautiful book full of helpful tips and techniques. Well organized with lots of good images. Highly recommended for polymer enthusiasts who want to expand their repertoire, as well as beginners who want to get a sense of where they can go with polymer clay.
B0058EJJSM|5.0|I saw this tour, the 1st one Paul did with Wings in the USA, back in 1976. I liked it enough to buy the LP, and I decided to download a digital copy 36 years later. You can hear the difference in Paul's voice from 1976 to now. Still good, but he was 34 then. He was at or near his peak. Good band, too. It is worth buying if you are a McCartney or Beatles fan, as he does some Beatles songs, too.
1594744769|4.0|I liked this book, and appreciated that it could appeal to both children (preteens/teens) and adults; my (adult) book group has it on its list, too. I enjoyed the inclusion of the unusual images, and the historical plot components. I read it on a Kindle Fire and didn't have any trouble seeing the images when I used the zoom feature.
B008I43DYU|5.0|This is the calculator that I have on my iPod.  I loved it there and I know I'm going to love it on my Kindle.  This is one of those great apps that just works.
B0074QGGK6|4.0|I had low expectations for this little book, but it was a lot better than I thought it would be. I plan to share it with lots of young people. I think it would be most beneficial for the young and those who would love to explore their creative side, but are scared about taking that leap even as a hobby, let alone a profession.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|I have not used this much, but I wanted to take a new picture of myself.  I don't know how much I'll use this, but I wanted a picture taking app.  I don't think I'll use it much, but good to have on my Kindle.
B008XG1X18|5.0|ADDICTING!!!!!!! Love it!!!! So many helpful topics. Cant put it down. Needless to say, my home is going to have a makeover one room at a time. Thanks Pinterest!!
B008RA3X5E|3.0|This seems like a nice app, but it keeps sending me messages to tell me that it has quit working.  That is kind of annoying.  The App seems to work well when it is on.  Maybe it won't work running in the background, that might a Silk problem and not the app.  If this is so, program it not to keep sending me messages.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|Love the Album.  I'm glad I purchased it.  The songs are awesome.  I am looking forward to her next album.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|I like this app.  I can scribble all I like.  I think it might be ment for kids, but as an &#34;older adult&#34; I find it a lot of fun.
B00AMSLRAC|2.0|It was working great for 10 minutes, then it flipped upside down and I can't get it fixed. If this problem gets corrected, I would gladly give this 5 stars. It is a cute game! We have a kindle fire hd 7.
B0067R0APK|5.0|This weather app is the best.  I like all the detail that I get. Maps, wind, day and night and ten days out and much much more.
B007L6VR12|5.0|Best movie I've seen all year!  Highly recommended to anyone that likes &#34;quirky&#34; films.  Great cast, great dialogue, funny, heartwarming, and a little weird (in the best possible way!)
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I really like this cover because it is less bulky than others I've seen.  It is clean, simple and works well.  I highly recommend it.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|Well made and nice color and protects the Kindle very nicely.  No more to say and I don;t understand why you need all these required words.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This was a college course requirement. After watching it I have recommended it to many friends and others. I believe everyone should watch this movie, it's about the &#34;financial crisis&#34; of 2008, what lead up to it and greed & corruption.
0547569653|5.0|The book is so inspirational and it is almost impossible to believe it is true. It feels like fiction! But it is not. I happened to start reading (actually listening on audible) some of the ultra runners book as a way to see how they are pushing their minds and body to achieve what they are doing. It is almost yogic in retrospect. I really wanted to give the print book as a gift to my 10 year old daughter only if it did not have all those Dusty's swear of F words. I really wish the author could have removed them and told __swear words__ here and leave it to readers imaginations.<br /><br />The way mother - son love is portrayed, his vegan lifestyle, his surreal runs on all those Western States, Badwater, 24 hr runs. Ah it is incredible. I had to resist finish listening into the story and hold back to enjoy in 4 days. Otherwise I would have finished in one siting of 8 hours. I listened to all in my walks. It is sad his life had all these setbacks (no spoiler here) and how he overcame in late 2010. One of the most memorable memoirs I have ever read.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|My 7 year old is learning some simple piano chords! He can't get enough of it! Even my 13yr old likes this little game!
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|Definitely funny moments, but ultimately this fell short of expectations. I think it just got to heavy/serious in the plot, which took away from the funnies. Started out good, but got weird lol. That thunderbuddies song had me in stitches though!
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|it's a great movie and I didn't look for it to be so good but it was and I am so glad I bought this movie I had never guessed that selen would end up having a daughter of hers n Micheal's so yep it is good I liked it
145552347X|5.0|Having lost both parents in the past two years, I wanted to read this articulate presentation of the many aspects of loss by a writer I've always followed.  His ability to share his feelings, without a maudlin trail of tears, led me into a world that was terrifying with mental and physical pain, explaining the loss of missing such moments as going to a movie (I always was torn by the fact that my friends and I lost our tap dance teacher to cancer before Gregory Hines' movie &#34;Tap&#34; was in the theaters; a small moment that Hitchens mentions as being on his horizon).  Compelling and deeply jarring.
B00003CXRP|5.0|great movie even though it is an older movie I always look for older movies as well as the new ones and this one is great Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt make a great team in this movie so looking for something different then try this one I know I loved it
B00APUYWYA|5.0|So funny love Rebel!!! She is one of the best!!! Anna did amazing! All around hilarious laugh out loud kind of movie!!!!!
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I am thoroughly pleased with this app.  Yes it should have been included in the device and it is a must have.  Enhances the device 100%.
B000HVHM5S|5.0|It has one flaw and that is that it does not give a good background of why the world is the way it is at this time. Otherwise a great film.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I love the all the Marvel movies. This was at a great price and the picture quality and sound on the blu ray is awesome!
B004AQR29C|5.0|This one is not as good as the second one, but rates 5 stars anyway. A great introduction to a sometimes funny sometimes crying team of mercenaries.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|I had heard that this movie was just the funniest ever, so I was very disappointed when I spent $4 to watch it and it turned out the be terrible.  Ted is a pot-smoking, sex-crazed teddy bear.  There were a few parts that were funny, but not $4 worth.  If I could get a refund and my time back, I would.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|A great movie that had only one fault and that was a new character was killed half way through the movie This one has plenty of action and multiple references to past roles played by the characters, especially Chuck Norris. If you can remember that this is Hollywood, then you will love it. If you are looking for a documentary, this is not it. A great job done by the entire cast but here is a spoiler, the chief get's a new love interest.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|I downloaded this for my granddaughter.  I am not that impressed with it but she seams to like it.  I just think it should teach them something good instead of making them laugh when the cat is hurt.
B009KHCT94|5.0|This movie is just plain funny and very entertaining. It would be good to read up on your military history before you look at it, however.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|One important point: the examples in the book may be US-centric, but the case is very similar to my culture in Asia. Must be because of our heavy US influence, though I can't say the same for other cultures outside US.<br /><br />The book made me realize that I'm a closet introvert and how much it has been affecting my life. Since learning those lessons, I changed some habits and embraced natural inclinations that I've been avoiding before.
B001KZG99A|4.0|Not a bad movie at all, but it does not address why the lead villain goes the way he does. It has great flight scenes and is not a movie I would not want to see again. Greatentertainment
1419705849|5.0|My 10 year old son loves all of these books.  All of the stories are enjoyable to read, and very funny!
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Great movie. Loved it. Full on action with a touch of comedy. We watched it twice to make sure we didn't miss anything. Worth watching.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|My son has been reading this author for quite a few years and getting this now on his iPhone as an e-book was great.  He read it very quickly.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|The application does all I require of it.  Just learning how to use the Kindle Fire so I`m not an expert.
159413586X|3.0|I join the crowd that is somewhat disappointed in the ending.  Killing off the sister who made it this far was just MEAN in my opinion.  It went from somewhat believable in the first two books to just plain weird in the last one.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Not bad. Not great but not bad. There are alot of games but the games aren't that great. Like I said, not bad.
B0017SWPXY|3.0|Interesting point of view.  Unexpected turn of events.  A pretty good story.  Dog lover's would enjoy this story.  I hoped for a little more.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Even better than I expected. Surprisingly good movie. Will Smith is great as always, and the guy who played younger agent K did an awesome job channeling Tommy Lee Jones.
B005F3XV62|5.0|it was a funny and hilarious movie my husband loved his Christmas gift and he loved watching it also and i loved watching as well
B007SGM084|3.0|I picked this up because I was wondering what all the buzz was about. I heard people talking about how &#34;naughty&#34;, &#34;dirty&#34; and kinky it was. Quite frankly, Laurell K. Hamilton writes sex that's far more &#34;kinky&#34; and in a much better way than Ms. James. I'm not saying I hated it, because it wasn't awful. I enjoyed reading it but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for &#34;kinky&#34; sex ideas. You can get those for free on the internet.
B008ZCWFEE|1.0|while it I  easy to figure out - it does not offer an understanding of the problem solving. would prefer my kids understood instead of just balancing picture pairs
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Hard to put down, the story is fast moving and plot is not as predictable as most mystery novels.  One of my favorite authors, Baldacci writes stories that are fun to read and hard to put down.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|I thought this would be similar to the the iPhone one I had, but it was not the same and much less interesting. Disappointed!
B008O037RG|5.0|This album is wonderful and it plays beautifully on my record player. I will be enjoying it for a long time to come.
B009IKPOUO|5.0|She never fails to disappoint me! I didn't know about this release ahead of time so it was a great surprise for the holidays!
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|There is nothing to talk about this movie. The trilogy is excellent!!!<br />For those who have not seen and like Si-Fi, I recommend the movie.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Is a good app I love it ..keep the good job up ..it looks good the way you have the setup
B00021HBGS|2.0|Had hopes that our grandson would love playing w/this during bath time.  However, the foam pieces would not stick to<br />the tub wall as advertised.
B00APUQMD4|5.0|This movie is great! I love that they took it to a video game feel.  The cgi is over the top and I think it looks amazing.
B004LQEYAG|2.0|Disapointing storyline and thought there would be better acting from these two great pros. The female part is laughable. Would can this dvd.
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|The story seems to have been built around the idea that admitting ones mistakes requires bravery. I would wholeheartedly agree with this. However, the main characters actions are not what I would consider a clear example to the under 13 crowd of bravely admitting your mistakes. Instead, it seemed to me most of the movie is about the young lady trying to prevent the truth from coming to light and helping her mother cope with the results of her actions. The large reliance on magic for plot advancement doesn't win points with me either. I would have preferred a message that conveyed the importance of admitting mistakes promptly and that asking for help if it is needed in addressing the consequences. The later requires an equal amount of bravery in my mind. Probably my biggest issue with the movie-and a completely subjective one- is simply that I expected something very different. I thought it was going to be about a young lady taking charge of her destiny in a man dominated world and instead, this is where the movie ends.
0783225903|5.0|fascinating and oh so relavant to our broken government. The sets and costumes in this movie make it very special. Is it true that George Harrison produced this film?
B0090EJR1K|2.0|Anybody that is a fan of Borat and Sashas previous body of work will find this movie to be cheap collection of predictable jokes. Glad I didn't see this in theaters but I do wish I had waited until it was on network TV.
B000002AGN|4.0|oldie but goodie. Brought back many great memories of Brubeck with great quality sounds and arrangements. Would by more  Brubeck.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What an AMAZING HEARTBREAKING STORY!!! I actually felt my soul hurt. I loved the way it was written, I love the story. I can still feel my chest tight. I will recommend to my friends. Colleen Hoover, you took my breath away with Slammed and Point of Retreat.. You KILLED me with this one. Thank you.. I think this book will help a lot of ppl in this unfortunate situation.. Cause the sad truth is that this unfortunately happens in real life. I cannot wait till I read another one of your books. :0)
B005XLN97M|5.0|My daughters first barbie house and she loves it :) It was a great deal for the price nice and sturdy/
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I learned about it from a friend who also has a Kindle Fire.  It is so addicting, I love the challenges.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I found I couldn't put the book down - very well done, as usual for Grisham!<br />if you like Grisham than don't hesitate to read this one.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|I love this soundtrack! The movie was great and the soundtrack is directly from the movie. The only thing that would make it better is if they would put more of the songs from the movie on the CD.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I've been a huge Batman fan all my life, and was blown away by Chris Nolan's vision of the Batman universe and was very happy when this arrived in the mail. I sat through all 3 movies the day I got this collection and have been going through the awesome bonus features piece by piece. Kudos for including the book and all the awesome pictures, I'll have to pick up the full-sized version soon!
B007W7P5L8|5.0|Simple cover does it's job. Love the color too. The elaastic may wear out befor the cover does but I'm handy and can fix it if I have to. I'm getting one for my grand daughter.
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|Fun to play, but some objects were too small to find using my phone. The game also penalizes you for not clicking on the exact location they want for each object. Fun game over all though.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Being a huge Rod Stewart fan I just had to buy this and its been great listening to the songs.
B001DHXT6G|4.0|The episodes look so much better with the enhanced visuals.  So far, I have watched mostly 2nd season episodes; a few from the 1st season; and one from the 3rd season: &#34;The Savage Curtain&#34;.  Strange to see Abraham Lincoln in the ...Curtain episode.  That was a good story though. I think the best acting performance was William Windom's role as Commodore Matt Decker in the 2nd season's &#34;The Doomsday Machine&#34;.  You talk about someone who was overcome with guilt and sorrow after condemning his crew to death, then finding the ultimate sacrifice in taking his own life by piloting the Enterprise's shuttlecraft 'right down the throat' of that automated robot planet killer.  Was Windom ever nominated for an Emmy award for his acting performance in that episode?  I will continue to enjoy watching the rest of the episodes.  I strongly believe that The Original Series was the best Star Trek series ever with Next Generation a close second.<br /><br />  Ted H.
B006C45CFG|2.0|I was a huge fan of HF and a recent fan of DC, but this was too silly for me. And, I am pretty good about watching movies like this just for fun. This was far too predictable and there just was NO depth to the characters. I have not been impressed by Craig's skill with accents- his American accent in this was almost as dreadful as his Polish accent in Defiance *shudder.*
B00004YX39|5.0|I'm a Steely Dan fan from way back, this is a good one.<br />It contains the obvious hit Babyon Sister and Hey Nineteen,<br />but the other tracks are equally good.
B006VREHRS|2.0|Guess you have to be a big Scorsese fan. This did not live up to my expectations- my dad, brother, and husband and I all watched the 1st episode and thought, &#34;Meh.&#34; Too formulaic.
B00846TTDG|3.0|It's amazing what these elite human beings do for our country, I will never dispute that but perhaps this was better served to be produced as a documentary rather than a movie.  That approach would have made fewer $ in the box office but definitely resulted in a better product.
B004U8VWLE|4.0|I heard some criticism of Portman for not giving enough credit to her dancer-stand-in, but she is the actress here. It is not a movie of a dance performance...it is a movie about a dancer. A dancer-not-actor could not have pulled it off.
B006LSZECO|4.0|An interesting mystery that keeps you guess and is told in an interesting style, bantering back and forth between the main characters as if told in the first person.  I recommend it for those of you interested in a good mystery!  I will probably purchase other Gillian Flynn novels.
B0059R5Q08|4.0|Given the relatively short length of the movie, I was pleased- it felt like the film maker kept the essential elements of the book. The actors were outstanding.
B000VYX8PE|4.0|As a teacher, I have watched as my students have delved into the lives of the Baudelaire children, reading book after book and then ultimately asking me to read them as well. I love the obvious context clues for vocabulary and the way the book attaches to characters to their reader. I look forward to reading the rest of the books and adding them to my book corner!
0061438294|5.0|I read this book awhile ago, but it has been invaluable to me ever since.<br /><br />There are many non-verbal tells which can help you verify or invalidate your intuitive beliefs about what other people are saying.  I tend to focus on myself more than others so I have been tremendously handicapped in my interaction with others.  I was unaware of what I projecting as well as what others were implicitly telling me.  This book directly points out several non-verbal indicators for you to monitor, as well as suppress for yourself.<br /><br />Not only that, but it bases its explanation in a scientific backdrop which explains the derivative of where these non-verbal cues come from.  This was vital for me, because I am highly dependent on logical explanations for memory retention.  My personal experiences utilizing some of these observational skills have been confirmed as well.  However, it does take practice, and I usually have to consciously force myself to look for the indicators.<br /><br />Also, the author does not oversell the power of non-verbal cues.  They are one part of a picture, and they are limited based on how well you know someone's base behavior.  An individual's habits may send non-verbal messages which were not intended, so I also appreciate how he always emphasizes variance from norm.<br /><br />Overall, this guy is a great author, and an excellent writer.  There are great anecdotal stories which illustrate the points he is making, and it is interesting and informative to read.
B008ELUEQC|3.0|Somewhat disappointed by this one. Maybe it was the selections that didn't quite make it. Keep on trying Rod. I think he has done better.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book is amazing. Hilarious, sad, honest, heartfelt. I would definitely recommend it to anyone and will probably be reading it again.<br /><br />It deals with such a serious topic (mental illness) in such a humorous way. Pat Peoples is one of my all time favorite fictional characters and we could learn something from him. \\"I'm trying to be kind instead of right\\"
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|We have followed her since she began and have collected all of her CD's. This on has been added to the car collection on flash drive.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. The story line was fantastic and the graphics are awesome. I hope that G5 continues to make these types of games.
014241493X|5.0|I cant say anything about this book as I bought it for my daughter who had to read it for a school project and it wasnt available at the library.
B0094M2UWG|5.0|Extreme talent Good story sixteen more words are required for this review So I may not review everything few words say it all
B0043KK4N6|5.0|I cant say anything about this soundtrack as I bought it as a gift, but my daughter seems to love it.
1419705849|5.0|Always a great sign. We actually had to make him put it down to eat, that almost never happens with this kid :)
B006ZCWTXS|5.0|when I listened to her audition on the X-factor UK, I just knew she was going to go far. Her voice is so different and distinct. My husband said she reminds him of a young Natalie Cole. Immediately I knew I had to have her album. I love all the longs but my favorite is &#34;Mr. Bright Eyes&#34;. I love her personality. Cant wait for the next album.
1609611543|4.0|As I said, I have heard a great deal about this book from others and I am just starting to read it after the holidays.  Have not had much time for that yet..  Happy to have received it and in the short time that it took to arrive here before Christmas.  Good service.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|the CD came as promised and was as expected. What can you say about a new Cd? my daughter loves it.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I have a 7 yr old and a 3 yr old and they both love this game! more Perry the platypus!
B005HSG3VK|4.0|This case does a great job of protecting my kindle fire, it's  also super cute in pink.  The only thing that prevented me from giving it 5 stars is that sometimes it slips when propped up.  Other than that, it's great.
B003EYDU60|4.0|And I love it for the scenery! (Linda Cardellini!!!) Sarah Michelle Gellar is no slouch either!  Wife didn't like the scenery
B008DVJMAW|5.0|This is a great album. If you like old school southern rock. This is for you. They sound like Lynerd Skynerd in there prime. If you'r disappointed with Skynerds latest efforts. Try Blackberry Smoke. You will not be disappointed. They ROCK harder and ROLL all night long. Blackberry Smoke is the REAL DEAL. Best band I've heard in 25 yrs.
0307341550|3.0|have not read it yet (too many books) but looking forward to it and belive it will be a good read.<br /><br />Update; read the book it is great. One of those books that once you start, it is hard to put it down.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|I want Adobe Flash and I am finding that Adobe Flash is not easy to install if at all on Kindle Fire HD
B00005N6KG|5.0|These are my second pair my grandson broke my first pair unless I'm ready to shell out real money these are the ones.
0857685627|5.0|Very well done and really enjoyed by my son who received it for Christmas. He now wants the others in the series.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|Each year my boys, ages 14 & 21 get a Lego to build.  Now that they are older I get 1 for the both to work on together.  This was challenging enough for both and they enjoyed building this together.  It is not easy to find legos for older kids but this was Perfect!!
B009E3EY4M|5.0|Christmas gift for my brother and it is a great show in Blu-Ray Led Zepplin it was great seeing the old guys rock !
B000QCTNIW|5.0|I read a lot and this is one of the best books I read all year. Not only was it an education, but it changed the way I live my life. I highly recommend it.
145210655X|5.0|This book is great for Star Wars fans.  The illustrations are very well done and it references memorable moments from the series.  Very cute!
B004LWZWGK|3.0|Wraps up the series but not as powerful as the others. A must for fans of the series. Others may want to rent
0525952926|5.0|I am really glad I bought this book. If you like historical novels this is a exellent read. Since it is the second book in the Twentieth Century Saga, you should read Fall of Giants first.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|This book is something special and quickly becoming my go-to resource for food (and more). The author builds up your skills from scratch while telling stories, showing pictures, and giving shortcuts that some other cookbooks fail to offer. I've enjoyed both how approachable it is to follow and how much fun it is to read. The reading is entertaining, but-just as important-the advice drives the reader toward action: learning skills, eating good food, reflecting on how to incorporate principles of simplicity into one's life. Although billed mainly as a cookbook, it's so much more.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I liked this band the first time I heard them..It was the track \\"Little Talks\\", being performed live. The album is great! I love most of the lyrics to these songs, as well as the use of both male and female vocalist. I have nothing negative at this point to say about \\"My Head is an Animal\\"! So if you enjoy this genre, you'll love it too.
B005LAIGSM|1.0|Well to start off (bear with me on this one) the whole incident was HER FAULT!!!!!! She was the one who felt like getting it on in a CAR in the middle of the ROAD during WINTER in CHICAGO and its SNOWING!!!!! HELLO! snow plows, trucks, cars, its SLIPPERY on the roads and your lights are OFF on your car! DUH! Go somewhere and do it! Also, seriously the guy took all the heat for this! He SUFFERED for her and she basically walks away from him during most of the movie!! Gah! And the ending? What happened to that? I realize that that was probably how it all went down, but seriously, if you want people to actually like your movie then put them back together in the end!! Seriously happy that I rented this movie.
B00280LYIC|3.0|Its perfection... if you let me read you'll have more from me but I can't read it right now thanks!
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Very please with this book, my fourth grade kid loves it! we almost all the wimpy kid series, great buy!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|At first I just bought the book because it was a cheap book. But this has been one of the best books  I have ever read
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Nice to have when you're trying to kill time or just want sumthing to do. Never gets old.  I'm so glad I got it for my phone and kindle.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This game is amazing and can be played well with the stylus. My son loves to play this game. It's his favorite game.
B0079R8IYW|4.0|This is a great case. I really like it, I only wish it had a place to keep a stylus.
B00486070K|5.0|Works perfectly with macbook air. Nice touch, great materials. Would have been even better if it had LEDs for connection and activity.
B000JMLDCS|5.0|Every thinking Christian should read Chesterton's Orthodoxy.  It is full of wisdom, sound arguments and wit.  It gives perspective on a lot of the discourses that is still defining our culture.  It also tells his own story of faith.  I don't think writers is made like this any more!  A lovely read.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|I like all of the actors movie just didnt do it for me it was just okay. woud have given it 2 and a half stars
B00A757EFW|4.0|My wife played this growing up. I would say it takes her back to aplace where things were less stressful.
B005ZUR724|5.0|i love talkin to ppl and this is just like lord of the rings i always looked for a game like this
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is a great app! The choice of music or alarm is wonderful. The ability to dim the display and use this as my bedroom clock is also a great feature. Being able to program multiple alarms with different times is means I don't have to constantly mess with the program. I set it once for the entire week! For a free version, this clock/alarm is the best I've found.
B00A0R02HO|4.0|The unrated version is a much better version on so many levels. I was hoping for it to be on mars but still good.
B009Z5BPZK|5.0|The CW's long-running soap opera `Gossip Girl' came to a close with a sixth, and final truncated season of 10 episodes.  Gossip Girl is the television adaptation of the novel series, of the same name, written by Cecily von Ziegesar. The series was adapted and produced by Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage. Narrated by the omniscient blogger \\"Gossip Girl\\", voiced by Kristen Bell, the series revolves around the lives of privileged young adults who live on The Upper East Side, a neighborhood in the borough of Manhattan, in New York City, between Central Park and the East River and poor destitute loft-dwelling Brooklynites. \\"Lost\\" co-creator Damon Lindelof said:<br /> \\"If you go big, if you take a bold risk in your finale, even if it fails completely and totally, you will be remembered,\\" he said. \\"There's no such thing as a bad finale if that finale is remembered.\\" With Gossip Girl's series finale New York, I Love You XOXO Savage and Schwartz took a risk deciding to reveal Dan Humphrey a character that was considered the\\"good guy\\" the shows moral compass was actually the boy behind the blog: Dan Humphrey is/was Gossip Girl.
B008S4FZHI|4.0|This book is more like the early Scarpetta novels. Wasn't entirely convinced about the ending, but kept me engrossed most of the way.
B007XIC1GI|5.0|So enlightening. I loved Manson before but I have a better understanding of him. Didn't want the book to end. A must read.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book book is the best I've read in a long time. It was very fun and relatable, yet interesting at the same time. I recommend this book for any age to read because it grab a your attention and you never know what will come next. This makes the book more interesting and even more amazing and heart felt.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|overall pretty good but social aspect is messed up. Also this has the potential to be a sneaky cash cow.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I was expecting this to be a great book, but it was so much more than that. It made me laugh, tear up, and realize things. It's so relatable because it has a little of everything in it. I wouldn't recommend it to any person lower than high school though, because it has mature parts to it. I also think it would be more enjoyable to an older teen than a younger one.<br /><br />It keeps you on your feet as well as your kindle because you won't want to put it down when the book tugs your thoughts and heart in a whirlwind of directions. Don't put it off, read this book! So good I'm going to have to read it again.

B002N5N4MG|5.0|We just started watching The Big Bang Theory this year, on reruns, and fell for it. But we weren't sure that we were seeing them in the right order, and of course skipping through the commercials is a pain. Having the episodes play one after another w/o breaks is really great.

1455527475|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and I've recommended it to a number of friends and family.  And we've all come to the same consensus, 5 stars.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|If you manage to get past the first third of the book, it's a rather interesting read. Just. so. slow.
B004AKCMD4|5.0|Its a shame they may never follow up with a sequel.  The movie is very well done the animation is almost awe inspiring how well it is portayed.  My childern love the books and love this movie.  Overall the storyline moves at first fast but then slows to a better pace which makes it easier to follow and the action never stops.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I wanted to read this book before the movie came out and wow, I'm super impressed. It's definitely one of my new favorites.
B004ZJZPXY|5.0|Over all great actors with british satire and even alittle slap stick comedy.  Even though in some spots if your not british you might not understand it still entertains and has you keep watching over and over and with the bonus features you can dive into more comedy.
B0007OCG56|5.0|Watched over and over. A great movie to watch with older children. A beautiful perspective on the turmoil of a broken family and the impact of America on culture.
0385536828|5.0|This is my first Ian McEwan book, and I found it extremely well written and while it takes place in the '70's, I found the story timely.  I was unable to put the book down, and I real a ton of books.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|That little boy will melt your soul. I've watched it over and over already. Action with robots kicking the fire out of each other, a love story between and boy and his father, and a good laugh when the tike makes the robot dance.
0553381687|3.0|Without getting into particulars and ruining it for those who haven't read it this story has some terrific and original ideas in it.Having said that, I just could not get past how wicked the world and the people inhabiting this story were. There was zero redemption or goodness to buoy the reader up which made it a drag to read. GRRM is a talented author, but what I would like him to know is that unrelenting evil might sell, but in this case it prevented a wonderfully conceived story from being stellar. A good book but it doesn't belong beside Tolkien , Herbert or even Rothfuss in my humble opinion.
B003UYUP58|4.0|as a cancer survivor I was interested in the perspective of an oncologist to the perspective of the history of cancer and the hope for a cure
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|I find the game easy and relaxing.  I have been able to enlarge with not too many errors.  The graphics are beautiful and engaging.<br />All together a enjoyable time.
0385336950|2.0|This book did not catch my interest.  After  30 pages, or so I closed the cover and stopped reading.  Doubt I'll go to the movie.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|This is my first official gaming mouse. I was in the market for a new one because I was getting tired of input lag and dropped connections from my logitech wireless mouse. I couldn't beat the price for this one, so I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />The mouse is great, it fits my hand well, glides well over pretty much any surface I try it on, and it's extremely sensitive and responsive to clicks. The cable too has enough give to it that it doesn't bind me up and inhibit easy mousing, but the braiding makes it far sturdier than any other cabled mouse I've had. I wasn't sure how I'd adapt to thumb buttons, but they are positioned perfectly, and it's surprisingly easy to tell them apart and click the appropriate button.<br /><br />I've only noticed two minor quibbles, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5. The first and most noticeable issue is that the center wheel has some side to side travel. It's not a deal breaker, but it is noticeable, and was a little distracting for the first couple days. Coming from a wireless mouse, I'm used to having the weight of a AA battery, so even though this is twice the size of my old mouse, even with all the weights added it still feels a bit light.<br /><br />Overall though, the build quality feels solid, and I'm very happy with my new mouse. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone else looking for an entry or even mid-range gaming mouse.
B009E3EXMU|4.0|The mighty Zeppelin is reunited for this one-off reunion concert and is in fine form. Aside from the occasional song or two that sounded off-key relative to the original recorded version, Zeppelin is tight as a drumhead.

B001U3Y5XE|1.0|First off, we own tons of LEGOs and think the \\"FRIENDS\\" and \\"CITY\\" are hours of fun.  However, as Lgames go, CREATIONARY is an epic failure.  There is no way to accurately 'create' most of the items on the cards due to the limited supply of parts and colors.  There are wheels which make the vehicles [with wheels] easy, but how do you create a pirate ship, or a banana for that matter.  A coffee maker?  THe only way they were able to guess that I was making a log cabin was because I used the saem color scheme as our Lincoln Logs.  THere is no way to make a slanted roof so any structure [doghouse for example] is an exercise in futility.  We have tried playing this game with all age ranges in our family and at each stage they all say the same thing:  This is boring because all the parts are not there.  It is as if the designers of the game and the designers of the cards that come with the game were not in the same room.  They took a bunch of spare parts, made up cards and vague rules, and tossed them in a box. We are going to return this item as 'defective'.  Sorry LEGO - Love everything else but CREATIONARY is a miss.
1400069289|5.0|Amazing book!!! It totally changed my perspective in how life works and totally Improved the way I live. Great way to start changing your habits.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|Got this for my husband's Christmas gift. He is a big Star Wars fan, and this was perfect!! Shipped very quick and was in perfect condition on arrival!! Picture quality is very good. This set also has all the removed scenes put back into the movies, so it was neat to compare to the version I had already seen.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very good. Used it on vacation while in the panhandle of Florida when there were tornado warnings. it worked great!

B004LWZWGA|5.0|This was an absolutely spectacular conclusion to a great trilogy. I love the exciting plot, the meaninful storyline, along with the great execution of the actors.

B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|Finally, it seems, Linkin Park is perfectly comfortable being Linkin Park. Infusing the experimental electronics, deeper lyrical themes and strong lyricism of \\"A Thousand Suns\\" with the hard-hitting, but now far more mature, rock of \\"Hybrid Theory\\" and \\"Meteora\\", Linkin Park has crafted a sonic masterpiece and arguably the pinnacle of their career. Drawing from elements evident in all of their albums, Linkin Park crafts a unique work most notable for a sound that is both powerful and reflective. Sonically, the electronic and melodic elements of \\"A Thousand Suns\\" and \\"Minutes to Midnight\\" couple brilliantly with the aggression of \\"Theory\\" and \\"Meteora\\", crafting truly unique tunes that are pleasant to the ear. What is so remarkable about the way in which Linkin Park pulls off this blending of old and new is that the different elements combine within individual songs themselves. \\"Lost In The Echo\\", in particular, stands out because it seamlessly combines the rap, rock, electronic and melodic elements of Linkin Park's entire career into one absolutely flooring song. \\"In My Remains\\" is another song that combines rock and electronic elements to provide an end result that sounds absolutely massive. Everything that Linkin Park ever did right sonically has been incorporated into this album, so that even if you didn't like certain parts of Linkin Park's musical journey, you realize all were essential in the band reaching this, which is clearly the sound they have always been searching for.<br />Lyrically, Linkin Park makes a brilliant move by examining themes previously prominent in their older works (heartbreak, loss, frustration, etc.) through the lens of the worldview the band arrived at in \\"A Thousand Suns\\". \\"Lost In The Echo\\" resolves to learn from broken promises and rise to succeed in the future. \\"In My Remains\\" uses a moment of broken tragedy to \\"set the silence free, and wash away the worst of me\\". To see the continuation of the recurring theme from \\"Thousand Suns\\"of tragedy being a catalyst for positive change is fantastic. \\"I'll Be Gone\\" looks forward to new horizons, while \\"Castle of Glass\\" uses beautiful and spiritual imagery to portray a longing for wholeness. \\"Victimized\\" resolves to never again allow one's self to be abused and taken advantage of, and \\"Roads Untraveled\\" is a beautiful tribute to the idea that when something falls apart, it is simply because fate and destiny have declared it not to be, and that one should resolve to continue loving, for the empty seat next to you is now and opportunity to befriend someone else. \\"Until It Breaks\\" brilliantly contrasts discordant rap verses with beautiful, even choral-like refrains, reflecting on the tragic realities of the world with the noble aspirations we should strive for. \\"Powerless\\" closes the album in a beautiful, moving fashion, recalling how often times true, innocent love can be taken advantage of by evil in the world, but when the song ends with a massive sonic experience that draws to mind cathedrals (partially thanks to the repeating instrumental theme of organs that surfaces several times in the album) the listener is left feeling, oddly, empowered.<br />Linkin Park seems to have arrived at the conclusion that life is hard, life hurts, that we are all \\"living things\\" that suffer heartbreak and disappointments. Ultimately, though, those failures should push us to \\"let the rest be the tale they tell\\", as the band so aptly says. With the rare perfect meshing of sound and meaning, I certainly can't wait to see what the \\"rest\\" is that Linkin Park will tell in the future.

B0016OOS16|5.0|I use the SpaceNavigator with Altium AD10 for electronic design and PCB layout, AutoCad for 2D drawings, and SolidWorks 2009 for mechanical design. SpaceNavigator installed using Windows 7 Pro 64 bit without any problems. I ran the install program per the quick start guide, THEN plugged in the Space Navigator and got the Windows Installing new device message. That was it.<br /><br />SpaceNavigator was available in AutoCad 2012, SolidWorks and Altium as soon as I opened the applications, no additional set-up was needed. The SpaceNavigator allows me to navigate around the screen while zooming in and out with one hand while using the regular mouse to add lines, text, etc to complete my design or edits. It is nice to zoom in and attached a line to a point, navigate across the page while zooming out for speed and then back in as you approach the attach point at the other end. All without Ctrl keys or other keyboard action, spinning the mouse wheel, etc.<br /><br />I work for myself, the more designs I complete the more I make. It comes down to clicks-per-hour. Now I have a lot fewer mouse clicks to navigate/zoom and more clicks designing. Also while designing I often needed a 3rd hand for the return key while entering data and pointing with the mouse. I have set one of the 2 buttons on the SpaceNavigator as the return key.<br /><br />In summary SpaceNavigator is about navigation on the screen, it is very useful in 2D space and especially useful in 3D space. It does not replace the standard mouse.<br /><br />I have not spent a lot of time trying to set it up for other apps. Mine does not respond in MS Office products such as Power Point, Web pages including this one, or most other apps, I do not know if there is something I need to do to set it up.<br /><br />It is ok with Google Earth but apparently does not support Flight Simulator in Google Earth.<br /><br />It has a nice heavy base and stays put. It looks very nice and is well made. The configuration screens are clearand offer a lot of options for the 2 buttons, motion control, and the speed.<br /><br />I have seen other reviews that complained about the fact it is not wireless. When used for CAD the small but noticeable delay as wireless devices wake up from power save, and their other delays, are a real problem. The CAD designers I work with (including myself)  have tried various wireless devices but always revert back to wired devices for their crisp instant action.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I cannot even begin to express how much I loved this book.  It is one of those books that has left an impression on my life and on my heart forever.  There are so many similarities between my life story and Sky's life story that I felt like I was living her story, but there were just enough differences that it wasn't too painful for me to read.  I don't want to give too much away but this book had heartache, love, betrayal, suspense, and more all wrapped into one amazing book. The love that Colleen Hoover creates between Sky and Holder is so special.  It makes you wonder if that kind of love is actually out there in the real world.  If you are looking for a truly amazing and well written book I highly recommend this book.  Colleen proved to be an outstanding writer with Slammed and Point of No Retreat and she DID NOT disappoint with Hopeless!  Thank you so much Colleen for letting me escape in your world that you created!!!!!  I absolutely love you and your books!!!!!

B00062PN6I|4.0|So far, so good. These headphone have good sound and an extra long cord. They feel a little cheap (mostly plastic parts). But if you're just looking for some general use over-the-ear headphones, I think that this pretty much fit the bill.

B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I absolutely adored this book (and not simply because the main character shares my husband’s surname). At its core, this is a story about a man who goes for a walk; he starts walking and keeps walking. He has no plan and is wearing the wrong shoes. Yet he walks toward something … toward someone. That may sound rather boring to fans of plot-driven fiction, but Rachel Joyce pulls this almost-exclusively-internal-journey and story-of-internal-growth off with great mastery.<br /><br />Harold Fry, and even the prickly wife Maureen are such likeable characters that you can’t help but root for them both. The reader meets some colorful characters along Harold’s walk to see an old friend but, more importantly, we learn – through flashback – the whole of Harold’s life with Maureen and their son.<br /><br />I was struck not only by the beauty of the writing and the ease with which Joyce writes flashback, but also by the themes of connectivity to nature. “Life was different when you walked through it,” Harold observes. Of his experience living with only the necessities and sleeping in fields, Harold reminisces, “He had developed a slow inner rhythm that the fury of the city now threatened to overturn. He had felt comfortable in the security of open land and sky, where everything took its place. He had felt himself to be part of something bigger than being simply Harold.” I LOVED this; far too many people are disconnected from the outside world, caught in the hustle and bustle of city life.<br /><br />The descriptions of England’s countryside were mouth-watering and make me want to visit again, they’re so lush: “A cherry tree stood in a dress of blossom, and as the wind took up it loosened a drift of petals like confetti.” And “At his feet the earth creaked and whispered. The air smelled green and full of beginnings. A soft mist rose, like wisps of smoke.”<br /><br />This is a story not just about our missteps in life, but in the ability to putone foot in front of the other toward a new beginning. I loved this novel and recommend it to lovers of literary, character-driven fiction who would delight in taking a romp through the countryside and cities of England, which Joyce paints with an artful touch (and to readers who enjoy lots of twists and turns, collisions and surprises).<br /><br />“The simplicity of it was joyful,” says Harold of putting one foot in front of the other. But don’t let the book’s “man goes for a walk” plot fool you into thinking it’s simplistic. It’s far from it; there’s much more at stake in this novel than a simple stroll.

B003E8P9G0|4.0|I loved this story. The story is a great way to teach kids about Egyptian mythology and places around the world. But, you may be annoyed that the child is asking about the book. The book is even more wonderful if you know about Egyptian mythology and ancient pharaohs.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love the hunger games! Romantic and sweet best book ever! The action and drama makes me want so much more!
B007DA2FHG|3.0|This could have been a great movie with realistic effects. Spielberg went cheap. The storyline was a little farfetched, the timeline jumped incomprehensibly and it was pure Hollywood style. The special effects were poorly done, the editing did not always make sense and some lines were pure corny and predictable. However, the scenery was beautiful, and the acting well done, Why not go the extra nine yards to clean up a potentially great movie? My guess is they didn't know how with their budget constraints.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book is amazing!!!! I couldn't put it down I was so interested in what was gonna happen I almost forgot to eat

B0038M2AZA|5.0|As someone who is self-diagnosed with AS and getting ready for a more formal assessment and diagnosis, this movie is quite encouraging and telling.  Claire Danes the same actress from [[ASIN:B005LAJ17M Homeland: The Complete First Season [Blu-ray]]] can flip her skills and play a wonderfully accurate depiction of Temple Grandin and her experience of an autistic (or Aspergers Sundrome) person through gait, speech patterns, and her visual view of the world.  The movie very much portrayed the way her mind sees in pictures and details.  Humor was not lost in the film as we get a peek into some of the literal images Temple sees: \\"lay it on the table\\" ... Temple was looking for something to be physically placed on the table.  The movie is filled with insight into a gifted Asperger (High Functioning Autistic) Mind.<br /><br />The film centers on Temple's gifts and her work in academia and engineering / drafting -- developing humane dipping and slaughtering machines for cattle.  Her belief being that nature was cruel enough: we have the power the create a sense of peace until the very last moment.<br /><br />Danes does a wonderful and convincing job.  5 Stars for this wonderful actress.  For anyone on the spectrum (adult or child) or if you know someone on the spectrum, a film like this is helpful to understand some of the inner workings and idiosyncrasies of the AS mind.<br /><br />Great film - Temple Grandin provides a great face of advocacy and hope.
1419705849|5.0|My son (who is 14) has read the Wimpy Kid books since they started.  He LOVED them and still picked this one first to read out of all his new books, on Christmas night.  He INHALED it and then immediately started on The Maze Runner, which he's loving a lot.  So it's for a wide range of tastes.  I highly recommend the series of books!

B009MCRHH6|5.0|I'm not much of a gamer, but when I find a game I like, I get addicted. This is one of those games! It's really beautifully animated, and even the music is good - at least it's one of the few games in which I don't immediately want to turn off the sound. I love the variation and increasing challenge involved, and the physics seems quite finely tuned. And those goo balls are so cute!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I thought it was an easy read and a  believable story. People and situations made me laugh, cry and worry about them. I liked all three books. Glad it had a happy ending in the last book.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|We didn't know that such a product even existed, yet when it popped up on Amazon, we knew that it was just the right gift for our gaming son. He couldn't have been happier, as it met multiple needs. He has just had it since Christmas, but already has used it for enough hours to know that it works great and the picture is outstanding. I can't answer about it's long-term operation, but so far, we are all very pleased.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is best novel yet! Glad movie is on the way! Nicholas Sparks writes the way women think! I like that his books don't go into so much detail about love making, just tease you!! Great Book!!
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I gave this to another daughter-in-law and she was so thrilled that she watched that night. And the best thing is that she didn't have sit through commercials.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I love Vince Flynn, and I love Mitch Rapp!  This was another good book, but it seemed a little &#34;vanilla&#34; in comparison with some of the others.  And, it left me hanging a bit at the end, which means there HAS to be at least one more!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I try to be restrained in my praise - I would probably rate it between three and four stars. The twist is very original, and the characters are complex. I recommend it. It is very well paced, and - like Tana French's &#34;Broken Harbour&#34; - is set against the dystopian backdrop of a collapsed economy.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|This was a great movie.  My husband loved it so much when we first saw it that I thought I would add it to his library of movies!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I love this series!  I enjoy period programs and this one is exceptional. It really transports you to a different time and lifestyle.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Lack of communication takes it's tole, after many years of marriage.  Anything with Meryl Streep in it is the best.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Fantastic footage of the planet ~ unbelievable shots ~ and the &#34;diaries&#34; after each show are great!  They show how those awesome shots were gotten!  A must have for any DVD collection!
B007FJFDXS|5.0|This game is a good puzzle game. I used to replay it over and over on my ipod, and am excited to see it rendered nicely on my kindle fire hd. Definitely worth giving a look at if you are into puzzle games that range from easy to challenging. I use this game to waste time while waiting around for my friends to get ready, and you can always put it down and pick it up whenever and start right back up!
B0018ARNME|5.0|Neil Young is as American and classic as music gets, and this is the best compilation of his hits I have heard.  I say this in large part because the sound quality is so much superior to the recordings found on 'Decade'.  If you are only going to own one Neil Young album, this is a great choice.
B00782O7NE|3.0|More of a novelty movie than anything else. The extra features were far more interesting than the movie itself and worth the price of the product alone.
B0028INIWE|5.0|If you do not consider yourself a \\"deadhead\\" but you enjoy many Grateful Dead songs, this is the album you will want to own.  These recording offer superior sound quality and the compilation will give you seventeen of their best loved songs.
B0085A9HXS|3.0|After the great reviews by large numbers of action fans, I went ahead and bought the bluray edition.  It's an ok action movie but just. The lip syncing is horrible and the color is very bad.  The action seemed forced, but there was lots of it. I couldn't connect with any of the characters. The extra features were done well and those alone are the reasons I'll keep the disc.
B0064Z7RXS|5.0|This is a wonderful and ground breaking album. If you are only going to own one Smashing Pumpkins album, I recommend you make it this one.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Can be slow and sometimes.  First gen kindle fire does not have news feed bug.  Better app for viewing facebook below.<br /><br />With flipboard, you can do just about everything you can do with the official facebook app.<br />Flipdoard is more stylish, faster, and does not have the news feed problems.  Also, you can view other accounts like twitter, instagram, tumble, and many more.
0451232852|5.0|Ken Follett seems at his best when he tackles huge projects, as in \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" and \\"World Without End\\".  With \\"Fall of Giants\\", our prolific author tackles the intertwining fates of five families - from Wales, America, Germany, Russia, and England - and their participation in World War I.  The stories are spellbinding, even though much of the history of the war was horrific to say the least, as millions died in what was mostly little better than one slaughter after another.  It was particularly educational to this reader to learn about the dilemma and politics of America deciding to enter the war.<br /><br />Follett meanwhile uses his 1000-page tome to illuminate the social issues of the day as well, from the ability of women to vote, to the ineptitude of the noblemen who became the military leaders by default.  The looming influence of Hitler even gets some treatment near the book's end, as the stage is set for the two following works in this century trilogy.  Like his earlier sagas, most agree this outstanding novel represents Follett at his best - and now on to #2, \\"Winter of the World\\", with the final installment \\"Edge of Eternity\\" due in another year or so.
B008NB0SQO|4.0|I just purchased this for my new son-in-love whose hobby is puppetry. We had all seen it years ago, but it was fun to watch as adults several days before Christmas. This and Muppet Treasure Island are my grown children's favorites from childhood. We were surprised that it arrived with both discs, there was nothing we need to download as the description indicates. I don't know that buying the blu-ray made much difference in this older movie, perhaps if you have a larger TV than our 55\\"? It is a great introduction to this classic--we all remember loving this when it was in the theatres and had it on VHS. The scary parts are done so as not to be too scary, but it would be good to talk about this with younger children and perhaps not for most children younger than five or six. WE discussed this after watching as my daughter and her husband are both doctoral students in clinical psychology. They and our son all agree and remember their own reactions when seeing this movie. So plan on a nice discussion time both before and after the movie.
0385535147|4.0|We greatly prefer Grisham's legal thrillers to his other unrelated works (like \\"Painted House\\" or \\"Bleachers\\"). We weren't too many pages into this one when we began to smell a rat, almost in the vein of his earlier work \\"The Partner\\", wherein supposedly the bad guy turns out to be a really clever manipulator.<br /><br />In \\"Racketeer\\", former attorney Malcolm Bannister has served five years in jail, supposedly wrongfully, as part of a sweep involving a criminal for whom his law firm handled financial transactions. When the Federal Judge involved in the case is murdered, and the FBI is getting nowhere, Malcolm begins a negotiation to supply them the killer and the motive in return for his release from prison and entry into the Witness Protection Program. We start to get that rodent smell again and suspect halfway through that another major plot twist is in the wind -- and ere it's over, we are treated to a most interesting story that reads quickly and entertains throughout.<br /><br />For our money, one of Grisham's best!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book, I enjoyed as much as the first book.  I am looking forward to the third book in this series.
B004QSQML8|5.0|The directors cut, extended version, is not my favorite version.  It takes way to long and the background music is weird. The picture quality is terrific.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have only gotten to the second difficulty, but it's a great game so far! Challenging, but still great fun!
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|Application works as expected.  Cloud printing functionality is not as easily configured as compared with other product.  Other than that, works good.
B005NFW0U0|5.0|Watch it with my daughter, but all in all a pretty good watch.  Is just like all the other vampire/ romance shows or movies lol
B00425S1H8|4.0|Using with an XP Laptop.  It works, though the install CD is a bit useless, get the driver from the manufacturer.  Works ok with puTTY for Cisco and Adtran routers.
B000I0QL82|5.0|I am not a fan of most old films, but this is a great one with great music. Is my wifes favorite
0307352145|5.0|This book explains something about the way I have acted and reacted.  It is correct in that I have learned to deal quite well in the extrovert side but I do need the time to regenerate.  The references made concerning politicians does reveal the author's leanings.
B005LAIGWS|4.0|I bought this DVD for my brother in law, but have  seen it.  It was shipped quick and is a good movie.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|This was a nice book to take a break from larger books. Here are eight more words for the requirement.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|definitely water proof, showered w my phone, i am so happy i can use the radio in the bathroom, only complaint is the screw for the headphone adapter, I'm so afraid I'm going to lose it when i use my headphones, and its hard to fit any other headphones into the jack but i figured this would be the case when i bought the lifeproof so it is not bothersome
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|the movie is very good no question. But streaming on HD was worse. The volume has to be adjusted b/w 50 and 15 constantly. and the movie wasn't even comparable with the regular format, forget HD.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Band of Brothers in my opnion is the best World War 2 series ever made. With a touch of Tom Hanks and Spilberg it is a series to watch several times. The estory is envolving and the truthfulness impressive. I love Band of Brothers, for me is a collector item!
B00AECGQF2|4.0|i played this on my sisters ipod and its free. I think its fun but seriously? $2.00? for a hair salon app? please make a free version.
B004UQPM4E|5.0|As a big fan I´m very happy with the blu-ray set. Amazing video and audio quality. Watch your favorite movies on blu-ray is amazing!
B003V6L94Q|5.0|Love the CD!!  I have been listening to it over and over again, and I never get tired of it.<br /><br />I love country and I love &#34;You Get What You Give&#34;
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Not showing any information on my Kindle as far as temp. wind etc.<br />What is the problem I would like to know
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is an amazing book- easy to read and a page-turner as well. It has helped my daughter to develop empathy for others deemed &#34;different&#34; and given her an invaluable inside perspective to their thoughts and how we all wish to be treated.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|it's a fun game but it's almost not worth it with the number of advertizements they force you to look at.
B009VLX8FS|4.0|Some cutesy songs, but generally well written songs. Deeper themes about love and life than i expected. Much more adult album.
B000002ADT|5.0|This album is a must have cool jazz classic that every jazz lover, jazz newcomer, or even music lover should have in their collection.  I bought this for my teenage nephew (along with some others), and he loved it--and already knew a little bit about Miles Davis too.  A great find.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|this app sucks, the widget is horrible! Its tho small, when you go into the app it looks good but the widget looks like poo. Nuff said!
0547569653|4.0|This book gave great insite into the amazing ability, presumably, all humans possess to be utterly amazing and perform at unheard of levels. The fact that eating differently affected Scott Jureks almost superman like abilities such as running laps up a 17 mile mountain trail or running 7 minute miles for over 15 miles blew my mind. I think Steve Friedman did a wonderful job at personifying Jurek, I even at some times in the story forgot Jurek wasn't writing it. Overall a very inspiring and intriguing read for those that are interested in ultra-running, or bettering themselves.
B00ABGEFWC|2.0|sometimes it just goes blue screened and they keep nagging you to do quests u dont have enough money to and I don't want to spend my real money not my kibbles.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I have downloaded it twice now.  It has never worked.  Very frustrating to have such a simple app not work every time.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My child loves this movie with the singing and colors. Also, has a good message for your child. Love this movie
B00136NUG6|5.0|I really love this album as I remember all these songs. I am glad to have been able to purchase it for my &#34;oldie goldie&#34; collection. Priceless!
B003Y5H5HO|3.0|As a fan of the Millenium Trilogy, I went to see this in the theater. I didn't hate it, but I do think they spent a lot of time, money and effort to make a film that doesn't capture the book in the same way that the Swedish films did. That said, I would see it again.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|I watched this movie when it first came out and always wanted to buy it. The great price at Amazon made me finally order it.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|If you liked Tudors, The Fellowship of the Ring, Excalibur or enjoy renaissance festival's, then you will love this series!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I enjoyed this book. It was an easy read. The words flowed smoothly and I was able to finish it in no time.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|My son loves this. He has al;ways bveen a huge Jurassic Park fan.  My husband also received a surrand sound system for Christmas and this movie not only looks great on BLu Ray but it sounds awesome.
B0086700CM|1.0|I have tried to play this game repeatedly on my new Kindle Fire but I can' t get it to turn when I want it to. Might be operator error, not sure tho.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This was an awesome gift.  Thank you!!  My brother will absolutely love it and it was a great Christmas gift!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I was a bit skeptical because I didn't think this book would be as great as everyone said but the author completely pulls you into the drama. She knows exactly how to end the chapters so it makes you want to keep reading. Most nights I had to force myself to put my Kindle down so I could actually go to sleep. It is a great book for anyone to read!
B0067Q42BY|4.0|the addition of an ever so slight story and jewels to collect make it better than the average Mahjong game. I have it on my phone, and it plays well, and the tiles are surprisingly easy to select.<br />I'd recommend if you like Mahjong.
B00338QENI|4.0|I really enjoyed this book as I do most books that educate me and raise my awareness of where we have been as a nation. I now understand how DNA is used to improve our lives. I also makes me see how far we have come since the HIPPA legislation.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I enjoyed this book thoroughly. I look forward to the next editions.  This was my first introduction to Follet and I think I am hooked.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I love all the dash games by Play First.<br />I can't wait to play Transylvania Dash.I can't wait for more additions to this series.
0064430227|2.0|Do I enjoy the book?  Yes.  Did my 4 year who enjoys long books enjoy it?  No.  The simple nature of the drawings is lost on the younger crowd.  You are being over ambious to think a child will enjoy this one
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Nothing more can be said for this game, but I'll try.  Great story.  Simple, yet edgy design. Now add a touch interface. Perfection. This combination works, it makes me come back day after day. If you have not played this game, great it now.
1433502410|5.0|It is great.  Better than I thought it would be, it's easy to understand, great notes and 200 maps to take us back in time.  Best Bible I've ever had.  Everything is there that you could want, plus it has access to website for questions or just more info, that's an 80.00 value all by itself.  You will appreciate this item.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game is fun and addictive! Some of the puzzles are challenging which is great! I can play this game for hours!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|One of the best books I've read! I'd definitely recommend this to other readers! Can't wait to read the next one!
0470503696|5.0|Each subject is detailed thoroughly and has examples that follow. The writing is relatively easy to follow for beginners. A good starting point.
B0076DELIG|3.0|I'm not going to reveals the details, just my opinion of the plot and characterization.<br /><br />This one is not as good as Connelly's other Harry Bosch novels. The reason for this is that Harry, always a maverick and outlier, engages in actions in the last part of the novel that are just too far out to be believable, given the reader's prior familiarity with the Bosch character. Moreover, having got himself in one hell of a mess as a result of these actions, his escape hatch is not so much &#34;out of character&#34; as extremely improbable. I think that Connelly may have written this one a bit too quickly.
B0093H8H8I|5.0|I'm using this CPU in a budget gaming build - I can't comment on the integrated graphics because I'm using a discrete graphics card.  I got this over the Core i3-3220 (which is usually cheaper) because this was cheaper with a promotion.  However, if you check the reviews for the HD 4000 graphics, you'll find that it will do fine at 1366 x 768 at medium settings for most games.  Moving on, this CPU is plenty fast for gaming, general productivity, etc.  A review by NCIX showed that the Core i3-3220 (which is identical to this CPU, just with HD 2500 graphics) was NOT a real bottleneck for games.  I have this paired up with an XFX Double D 2GB Radeon HD 7850 overclocked to 1025Mhz Core/1225Mhz memory and I can play Metro 2033, Skyrim, Dragon Age Origins, DiRT Showdown, Starcraft II, and just about any other game I throw at it at 1080p on the highest settings without a hiccup.  The only games that may tax this processor are Battlefield 3, since it is especially coded to work with multiple cores.  If you plan on playing BF3, doing video encoding, video-editing or anything especially CPU intensive, I would recommend you get any of the current generation Ivy Bridge Quad-Core processors.  However, if you're on a budget, this is the way to go.  It will serve your needs well and it runs very cool.  With a Xigmatek SD1283 cooler, my processor is 25C idle and 48C on full load, with the fan at LOW speed.  Compared to the AMD A10-5800K, reviews show that there isn't significant difference in the general user experience between these two processors, and the i3-3225 actually outpaces it slightly in most benchmarks.  However, if you plan on using this for a very low budget-gaming build, the A10-5800K's integrated graphics are superior.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Affordable<br />-Power-efficient 22nm technology; Runs very cool, and is much more efficient than comparable offerings from AMD<br />-Does not act as a bottleneck for high-end graphics cards<br />-Great for budget gaming builds,HTPCs, general purpose computers<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Can't be overclocked<br />-Doesn't make me breakfast or do my laundry<br /><br />Other Thoughts:<br />My system for your reference:<br />Intel Core i3-3225<br />ASRock B75M-DGS Motherboard<br />Samsung 2 x 4GB 30nm DDR3-1600 RAM @ 8-8-8-22 1T 1.38V<br />XFX Double D 2GB Radeon HD 7850 Video Card @ 1025Mhz/1225Mhz<br />Corsair Carbide Series 200R Case<br />Rosewill Capstone Series 80+ Gold 450W Power Supply<br />Samsung 840 Series 250GB SSD
B005G26NJE|5.0|Had not heard Gary Clark Jr before and saw the video from a promt at a flytying site. Watched the video and then went to Amazon Mp3's. Album was available and decided just to give it a try and not dissappointed at all. Good to see that new artist's are still comming out and playing the traditional styles.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I really really like this game but how slow it downloaded other than that it is a really fun game.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I could not put it down. This was a great book. Can't wait to watch the movie!! I will probably read this again.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I like the game I removed it then redownloaded it and know I'm hook for a free game it is pretty good.
B005XLN97M|2.0|This Product is a little more flimsy and my daughter broke it after playing with it for a short time. It was missing a lot of the coponents that it stated it came with like the chair, stairs and the couch.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Great game for the price! Very engaging and challenging. The game kept me excited to find the next clue.  Look forward to the next installment!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Great read.  Love how they have continued the Jack Ryan series thru to Jack Ryan Jr.  Lots of excitement and edge of your seat tension!
B0079R8IYW|3.0|It isn't the greatest cover I could have purchased.  It protects my Kindle ok but it is just not user friendly in my opinion.  If I prop it up it falls over..  and the cover in not magnetic so it does not close completely.  I have ordered another on like a friend has.  Think I will be more pleased with it.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Jodi picoults novel is nothing short of what we have come to expect from a woman who can take the topics that weigh heavily on the hearts of strangers and examine it from all angles, leaving the reader breathless with the knowledge we may have otherwise missed and walking away from this book with a new insight into the world we hear just briefly touched upon on the evening news. Truly worth every second and every penny.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Christmas Michael Buble'  Fun and merry listening a great addition to any Christmas collection from Thanksgiving to New Years Day
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I should have returned it but was so digusted with it I did not want to waste any more effort on dealing with it.
0385535139|5.0|True John Grisham with all the suspense, excitement and do the right thing approach.  This is an easy and entertaining read.  Would recommend it.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|Sylvia got a little too overboard.  It  somehow left the romance and got too kinky for me.  It's not a good read.
B007VPLNGW|5.0|My 4 year old daughter and I a 40 year old, have old lady have a great time playing this game together we both enjoy it!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This movie is great for all ages.  I have seen adults and children alike sit and not want to leave when watching it.
1400049628|5.0|This book started the recent craze in the past few years for zombie apocalypse books; I really like the follow-up Mx Brooks did too: World War Z
B0050XFYNA|4.0|It is great to see the love that can keep people together but when it is brothers it dose make this feel wrong.  but the movie is great and has a good plot,
0307346617|5.0|Out of all the the books to come out of the recent zombie craze, I especially like the &#34;bigger picture&#34; worldview that this volume brings. The realistic &#34;primary sources&#34; style that Brook's uses highlights the thoroughness of how political, social, and cultural dynamics would be affected by the rise of the undead. I especially enjoyed his social satire moments in the book, like the bodyguard's account of when all the of Hollywood celebs hole away in their own special compound, that eventually gets invaded.<br /><br />Thorough and far-reaching, this is a must-read for anyone interested in the speculative genre and in zombies.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book was riveting. I was shocked at the content however. I think Christian is a sick dude! I have been living under a rock, I guess. I wonder about the Author, E. L. James. Curious how they know this stuff. I understand the rumors I have been hearing now. I didn't like the way it ended.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|This movie was excellent (in my opinion) and I was on the edge of my seat through out the entire movie.  This will make a great gift for anyone who enjoys the borne series
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|The story and action was really good, although it wasn't quite what I expected from a Batman movie. Still, a good ending for the series.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|great app for a lot of different things. I got it mainly for screen shots works great just says it needs an update but then theres no update available!
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|This is a really cute application.  Would recommend it for young and old.  Not only is it fun, but, following the notes as they drop is a great mental exercise.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Grandson loves playing with it.  Its fun to kill time with.  would recommend down loading it on your pad.  rate very good
B0053FANS6|5.0|it was in mint condition and new! Soemone got it for Chirstmas and loved it! Now she gets to share it with her friends.
B004SD5GZ4|2.0|after downloading this app after informed via program needed it to read program it still would not open  still working with it
B005LAIHZY|4.0|This movie is probably more suited for ages 7 and up. Has some adult humor in it like 'Tangled'. Not a love story like other Disney princesses movies. Wonderful mother and daughter movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I started this book yesterday I was not sure it was a good pick, it's about teen age love and I am far from a teen. I kept reading because it did hold my interest and I'm so glad I did! I haven't been able to put this book down, it is a great book and I found myself emotionally attached to the characters.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It ended as I anticipated. I enjoyed her \\"voice\\" and the way I was often on edge, not being able to put the book DOWN!! I think the movie was an exact version of the first book, which I enjoyed very much. I would recommend this book series to all my friends! Thank you for the much needed distraction from real life at the moment. \\"May the odds be ever in YOUR favor,\\" lol!
B000FBJAOG|5.0|im amazed at the level of research he did and i intend on using this @ the apocalypse! Where to get an RPG... ;D
B00A23MYCC|1.0|the movie seems targeted at juvenile 35 year old males, and was a great disappointment. If you were not a child of the 80s this film is probably not for you.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book was very good until the very end. At the end, it felt like the transition was rushed. It could have been different but nevertheless it was a good read.
B007RTUPTS|5.0|Amazing fellowship! These men just can not stop playing - and don't you let them. Buy this vinyl, you won't regret.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I don't have a facebook but my dad sometimes uses this app and he has no issues with it. I totally reccomend this app for anyone who enjoys going to facebook. its not bad at all. :)
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|This was a very cute and funny movie. I am an adult and loved it and kids and adults alike should enjoy it.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I have never played Angry Birds. I uploaded this on my Kindle Fire and it is very fun to play on! Even though the levels get really hard but I totally reccomend this and its also free so your getting a good deal here. :)
B007L6VR12|5.0|Good story, great acting. All the characters really got into their mid 60's roles. This is a good &#34;print&#34;, very easy to watch.
B007HO392S|5.0|The dc was awesome  here on time  and I was very very please  it was here on time  like I was told and the price was  a good one as well happy with every thing I have gotten  from there  this year
B009NPA3MS|5.0|I am not a big CD purchaser.  We just don’t buy them anymore.  After Phillip Phillips became 2012 American Idol (who we truly enjoy his style and him as a person), we were excited to get his CD.  Amazon let us listen to bits of the songs which just made us want to buy the whole CD even more.  If you are truly a Phillip Phillips fan, you will LOVE this CD.  Jimmy Iovine gave Phillip total control on how he wanted his CD to be put together and he wrote most of the songs.  As I mentioned before, we stopped buying CD’s many years ago.  But this is a MUST HAVE!  We can’t wait for his next album.  We hope he stays true to his way of things.
0446554995|2.0|I have read all of the Pendergast series and until recently enjoyed them greatly.  Unfortunately, the authors now appear to be \\"churning out\\" new novels, simply for the sake of creating more wealth.  This one was much more \\"Clive Cussler\\" than it was Preston and Child.  Their writing has lost its creativity and complexity and I don't intend to buy anymore of the series.
B008JGSM6G|2.0|I would love this game. But the keyboard keeps coming up on my kindle fire. What's up? I cannot see all the Flow board due to the keyboard taking the bottom half of the game page. I have no problem with the keyboard anywhere else. So the 2 stars.  Please look into this. Thanks.<br /><br />Jan 2, 2013<br />I found a way to delete the keyboard.  Press on the left arrow on the \\"main kindle\\" screen, not the one on the Flow game. This will make the keyboard disappear. You can bring the main screen up by pressing the two small lines at the bottom of the page. A great game. Still the maker needs to fix this issue.
B005VTGB0S|5.0|Very nice cover and stable the felt protects the iPad and it is not too bulky. Nice style on the outside too
B005HSG3VK|3.0|Its ok, wish the case was harder but over all worth the price that I paid for it. May consider something else eventually.,
B0063GORYU|5.0|Because It was fun and make you think about you moves. I play it on my computer alot of the time.
B009CG2YDE|3.0|I found this game fun until I got stuck at a boss level that requires accuracy that the controls don't really afford you. I ended up frustrated and bored. It's also pretty glitchy with some assets disappearing at random.
B0063IH60K|5.0|My husband likes to play this game alot so do I like it.So we both play it at the same time me on my kindle and he on the computor.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Anyone that has a sibling will feel like the character Katniss and anyone that has ever been in love will fall in love all over again. Great book, couldn't put it down.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I've allways hear about angry birds games but never play it before till now its fun to play. I like it.
B005I6EU7U|4.0|I love the looks of it and also the feature that lets you turn the cover page to the back. I do wish it had some kind of closure or latch, maybe a stretch band that would keep it closed.
B004WR125O|4.0|Haven't tried this on my reciever yet. But if I can do the things that it say I can it will be great!
B00004UEDQ|5.0|I work for the homeless shelter for 80 men. This was a great movie to watch and cover life skills groups and recovery groups
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|Again one of the Great Stargate DVD's I now own.  Keep up the good work!  If you've seen SG1, SG Atlantis than you have to see this one.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|I work for the homeless population for men and it covered my housing group, life skills group, and recovery group. All at the same time
0525478817|5.0|I have had this book for many months. But because I'm a coward I didn't read it until now. I was still afraid, though. With good reason. This book is heartbreaking. It's so sad. But only very near the ending. And it's so damn good that you cannot not love it. The Fault in Our Stars is a book about love. And it's perfect. It's also a book about cancer and living with it. Which is all kinds of awful. But it's also a happy book with lots of young love and happiness and it's all just so good and I never wanted it to end. But it did. So heartbreakingly good and gut wrenching.<br /><br />This is the story of Hazel. A sixteen year old girl with cancer. I won't try to explain her sickness, because I would most likely suck at it. But know that it is awful, so awful. But it's also so perfect and so well written and I loved it a lot. It sort of gave life to the character, even if the cancer is slowly killing her. It's so interesting to read about. She has to have this oxygen tank on at all times, and while that sort of disturbed me a bit, I also loved it. It's unique, and it just made me love her a lot more.<br /><br />There is a lot of pain in my heart from reading this book. A lot of pain. First there is pain for Hazel. She seems so sad all the time. And I totally get that. But she's also pretty happy, and I loved that. But she does everything for her parents, and that was sad. But I understand it so well. I actually loved her parents. They love her so much. And it's just so awful for them as well. Her dad is crying all the time. But he's also so caring and kind and I just adored him. Same with her mom. They were awesome.<br /><br />This is also a book about Augustus. Hazel meets him at this cancer kid support group. He's deadly handsome. And just so amazing. Most likely my favorite character. It's just impossible not to love him. He's perfect. Gorgeous, kind, funny. Everything you want in a boy. He's also a great friend, perfect boyfriend. Another I loved in this book was Isaac, he's best friend. He's adorable. He also gets his heart broken. It was awful. But also so amazing. He was just really fun to read about. And I enjoyed that a lot.<br /><br />There is a lot of sick kids in this book. But it isn't all about sickness. But those sick people we do get to know.. it's, well, heartbreaking. I don't have another word for it. There is just so much pain. But it's so good and I couldn't get enough of it all. I loved reading about Isaac's cancer. And Hazel's. And mostly Augustus's. It was just so bad. But so perfect. And I have no words for how good this book was. I'm doing my best to describe it, but I'm pretty sure I'm failing. I need a sequel to this book. Truly.<br /><br />The plot in this book is amazing. Hazel is such an amazing girl. She loves this book that she's read so many times. She gets Gus to read it, and he falls in love with it as well. And I loved that so much. It was adorable. She has tried so many times to get in contact with the author of that book. And it's kind of amazing. There is even a trip to Amsterdam. Best trip ever. But also most sad one. I hated that author. Really hated him. But it was so good to read about. And it was done so well and I loved it lots.<br /><br />The romance in this book is so great. It's sweet and amazing and just so perfect. I loved it so much. First there isn't much, I mean, there is flirting from the beginning which was awesome. But Hazel is trying to keep Gus from being hurt if she dies. But she gets over that. And then everything gets so much better. And it's all so good. And the romance is so sweet and I just wanted more and more. But we also got so much, and I will always cherish it. Swooning a bit right now, just thinking about it.<br /><br />I'm not sure what else to say about this plot. It's so good. So much amazing things happens. So much heartbreak and painful and awful things. And it is all so good. And I just loved every part of this book. I know I will re-read The Fault in OurStars so many times. It is a book that must be read and loved a whole bunch of times. You need to read it. Seriously. This is not a book to be missed. While it is full of heartbreak, it is also so good and happy and sweet and it all makes so much sense at the end. Well, okay, I still hated that thing at the end. But it's so good that you can't really dislike it too much.<br /><br />There is this tiny thing that I will spoil. I will not spoil how this book ends. What it ends with. How it happens. But I will say that something happens. And ah. It's awful. But anyway. I kind of new it before starting this book, so I'm hoping that you do too. I was sure there would be a death in this book. And there is. And it's awful. But it also surprised me a whole lot. And it was even worse than I had thought. And it's so unfair. But it also beyond perfect and I just can't decide how to feel about it. I want a sequel to this book. I really do. But there should not be one. I just need to know what happens to this one character. I also want deleted scenes. Many of those. Pretty please. &lt;3<br /><br />Once you start reading this book you cannot stop. I had been planning on just reading a little bit of it today. I didn't know it would be so addictive. But it was. And I had to finish it right away. So glad that I did. This book is just perfection. The writing is amazing. The characters are perfect, well, flawed, but still so perfect and so well written. There wasn't a single thing to hate in this book. Okay. That isn't really true. There was this thing happening at the end. So heartbreaking and unfair. So much sobbing.Stars so many times. It is a book that must be read and loved a whole bunch of times. You need to read it. Seriously. This is not a book to be missed. While it is full of heartbreak, it is also so good and happy and sweet and it all makes so much sense at the end.

B00AMBH70S|2.0|Good action, but did not live up to the previous Bourne movies, maybe it was tough getting used to a new lead actor.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Challenging at the higher levels and fun for all ages with the smaller flows. Overall a fun game! I would recommend it for anyone.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|Could have been better.  I found you really need to turn up your tv to understand what they are saying due to the southern accents the actors all carry.  I gave it an extra star because it is based on a true story so it made it a little more interesting.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|It has the color, story and fact. It reminds me of the apathy we all share towards our environment. I enjoy Mr. DeVito's voice in it.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|I couldn't watch this without thinking of Peter Griffin and Family Guy.  Seth Macfarlane really needs to get some voice actors for his movies and shows so all the characters don't sound exactly the same.  The critics all say this is the funniest movie of all time.  Obviously those critics are all 13 year old boys.
B00026ZG10|5.0|Again, another one of my top favorite movies.  Tom arnold is hillarious and I think its one of Schwarzenegger's better movies.  Jamie Lee Curtis and Bill Pullman are great also.  And again its got action, humor, drama all mixed in to make it a really good movie.  Everyone I talk to about this movie has nothing but good things to say.
B0050SYS5A|2.0|its dose not make a big difference i think in  my eyes it still seem the same as the regular view
1558908382|5.0|This is one of my favorite alltime movies.  Its serious in parts but it has more than its share of humorous scenes.  Cusack and Driver are great in it.  And of course Ackroyd is Ackroyd.....
B007IXWKUK|4.0|have not read the full book yet but i do hear its juicy i cant wait :) ) ) )
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I wasn't a huge fan of the Slammed series, but wanted to give Hopeless a try. I ended up being very pleasantly surprised. While parts will break your heart, it is definitely a beautiful and well written story.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|Wonderful price, I've always wanted to purchase the series, Just love it.  It was great when I was a kid and better now. Wonderful fast service.  Seems to get better with every order.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A fascinating biography about two WW II pilots, one German and one American, and a strange encounter in the skies over Germany.  Opened my eyes about things that I thought I knew.<br /><br />A must read.
B0053O89WY|5.0|nice no commercials and best episodes we have been watching it during the holiday break as a family and enjoy
0307592731|1.0|I'm not sure what I missed when reading this, considering how so many others like this book. I thought that while going on this hard adventure the author would discover herself and find resolution to the issues she had. BUT NO! She whined a lot, was looking for opportunities to have sex (why else would you bring 12 condoms on a hike when you're by yourself) and seemed to enjoy being miserable. I found myself wanting to just stop reading but the fact that it was for my book club kept me going. I was however the first one in the club to read and after hearing what I thought we decided on another book. Don't waste your time!
B002APU580|5.0|I believe this is the best version of the beloved novel. The actors were spectacular, from Keira Knightley, Donald Sutherland, and the lesser known English actors; all wonderful.The settings were beautiful, the emotions expressed will leave you wishing you could have such a romance. And the ending is so powerfully sensual, without any need for the graphic, all skin-baring scenes in most modern films. Simply terrific.
B000SEI230|5.0|Beautiful story, it made me smile, it made me cry. This book I will never forget.  A must read for any romantic at heart.
B009YU9J0E|4.0|I listened to the previous albums after purchasing this one and found that I still prefer this one the most.  I love the haunting screams and distorted vocals and the overall intensity of the album.  The reason that I give it 4 stars, as opposed to 5, is that I am not always a huge fan of electronic music.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|A GREAT GAME.  Lots of fun and the graphics are beautiful!  The game is easy to play and very addictive.
0810997827|5.0|This series of DOAWK books has inspired my young boys 7 & 9 to want to read, which can sometimes be a difficult challenge as the mother of any boys can appreciate. The quirky illustrations and general format of the books is definately outside the box for originality and with a little fun attitude makes for an enjoyable, age appropriate read.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|Well I love Teen Wolf and so I really loved the dvd!! :D and the quality is also very good!!
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Waste of time unless you want to flash back to your 20's and watch it stoned out of your gourd.
0307346617|5.0|My dad had read the previous book, The Zombie Survival Guide, and enjoyed it.  This one came in perfect condition and was packaged very well.
B006TTC54A|3.0|This was not nearly as good as I remembered, but it does have some funny stuff. It has a huge list of stars. Not as good as original Blues brothers, but okay. shipping was fast.
0877180121|5.0|I started my piano lessons with these books more than 50 yrs ago - hope my granddaughters will benefit from them as well.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|great place to get your local weather update great for anyone heading out .<br />check when you are planing to head out
0062127241|2.0|Like most people who would take it upon themselves to read this book, I am a huge fan of all things Who and all things Pete.  My expectations of this book were very low, since Pete is obviously one of the most pretentious, self-absorbed bores in all of the celebrity world.  This fact notwithstanding, certainly a life and career as remarkable as Pete's could translate into a kick-ass autobiography.  It should have, would have, could have, but it didn't.<br /><br />I found the book basically unreadable and was forced to skim through the majority of it.  It is just a chronological hodge podge of random events with minimal meaning, intrigue and development.  There are far too many 2nd and 3rd order characters who muck up the book while adding little value.  The entire style struck me as if a person with horrible attention deficit disorder went off his meds and went and wrote a book.<br /><br />My parody:<br /><br />\\"...and then I was socializing with Milt Waldrew, who was a bloke who helped do the final mix of Iron Man, who used to play trumpet with John back in Brighton in 1961, but things were not great with Karen at this time, because I strained things with my one night stand with Suzette while touring in Chicago, where the 3rd encore was horrible because of Keith's health problems, and I was so upset I went back to the hotel room and stared at my Meher Baba poster for 3 hours after which time I started drinking again, even though I had been sober for 4 months, so clearly Bill was increasingly worried, because the corporate structure of Eel Pie was being modified, which I discussed with my friend the author Tama Shalamar, who wrote some great Irish fiction about the druids, which inspired me to write a song which I wanted to leverage into a multi-media project absorbing the sanctity of human consciousness and how it is perceived by a child across mystical boundaries but by then I had sobered up again with help of Dr. Blisandblas....\\"<br /><br />Sorry Pete.  I love yabrother, but you should have teamed up with another writer/editor on this.
B002BVXYQS|5.0|It was since \\"Ok Computer\\" I didn't heard Radiohead composing music so focused both in rock with beautiful guitars, great vocals and lyrics, and, at the same time, using electronics devices with such a great result... songs as \\"Sit Down. Stand Up.\\" (track 2) proves how the band can create beautiful electro-acoustic landscapes which reaches a climax with a post-jungle, rhytmic, obsessive real drumbeat combined with drum machines and other wonderful little oddities which in Radiohead's world sounds just plain perfect.<br /><br />Great vocal shape by Thom Yorke, great production, great marriage between old rock aggressivity and cerebral electronic neurosis.<br /><br />An underrated album.
1463707606|5.0|Easy to follow instructions and nice pictures. The only drawback is that some things use oddly sized paper (Like 3:5) and I don't know where to get paper like that.
0525953728|5.0|I realy like this product, my husband was happy with his present  and I  like too. It was on time and it has all they offered. This company is the best.
0321885112|5.0|After hearing him on a couple of different podcasts during the summer, I pre-ordered Mike's book - looking forward to getting the visuals and instruction it would provide. The first thing I loved about it when it arrived... the design! It looks and FEELS like a sketchbook. Very clever! The layout is terrific, the instruction clear and concise and filled with examples, and the accompanying DVD pulls it all together into a package you can revisit over and over. I appreciate Mike's tone in writing and delivering the content on the DVD. He is both encouraging and enthusiastic. While I had a rough sketchnote style already, I've been practicing for several weeks now using the tips from the book. To test it all out, I took notes in a meeting a couple of weeks ago, redid them as \\"cleaner\\" sketchnotes, and then shared them with the attendees. They loved them! I look forward to continuing to improve in technique and will use Mike's book as a reference for some time to come.
B009O2XY12|4.0|I HAVEN'T HAD MUCH CHANCE TO PLAY THIS GAME YET.  HAVEN'T GONE PAST THE FIRST ROUND.  BEEN TOO BUSY WITH SOME OTHER GAMES!
B009T9P7OC|5.0|I like the equalizer capability and the multiple play back methods.  I have owned Cowon Mp3 players and was ecstatic to be able to use their software on my android.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|ALWAYS LOVED PINBALL IN COLLEGE AND EARLY MARRIAGE.  VERY PLEASED WITH THIS VERSION.  LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING INTO IT MORE.
B001KDQ4KQ|2.0|I didn't like this book as it was too sad.  I think it was well written and most of what happened could really happen in real life.  It was so well written I felt it was a real life story.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This set is beautifully organized!  If you're a West Wing fan it's a must have -- made a great gift
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|The special effects were good but the overall plot of the original was better.  I will say the way they moved people to the colony and back again was interesting.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The Hunger Games was truly a page turner, very difficult to put down. I can't wait to continue with the next two Suzanne Collins books.
0812979656|5.0|Roy did amazing things with this book. It was hard to read at times...emotionally, mentally, visually, chronologically and in many other ways. I'm astounded that this is the author's first book. Her incredibly detailed (and seemingly accurate & astute) insights into the innocence of children, the complications of love and how powerful, wonderful and tragic it can be left me wanting to get to know her personally.She made my heart hurt for her characters as if they were in me all at once. Reading this book has been an unforgettable experience.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I'm suspected to the series. They are a fascinating and captivating read. I cannot wait to read the last book!
B001706I5I|5.0|Good movie, very creative, with a good meaning.  I would recommend this movie for a good family time.  Jim Carey does a great job as th grinch.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|My boyfriend bought me the book \\"The Five People you Meet in Heaven\\". He told me I had to read it because it was an amazing book. He was right! Now I can't get enough of Mitch Albom and his amazing books and his imaginative looks about life.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book took my breathe away. It is a must read. So emotional, the character development is brilliant! Colleen has done it again.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really enjoyed this book I was silently rooting for them the whole time and I'm glad Conner realized his feelings in the end
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Loved this book. It was intriguing and had my attention throughout! I love navy SEALs. Read it, you won't regret it
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Very good book. Was captivated. Will buy it shortly<br /><br />Hehehe hehehe fudge the d. D B-) Negevhgf hung hung hung
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Just as good as the first book but with a bit more momentum and mystery:) Can't wait to read the next one....
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Great story presentation and visually beautiful to watch.  Children love to view it.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone either child or adult.<br /><br />Highly satisfied customer.
B005XOPEOU|5.0|I noticed this went on sale for $.25 for one day around September 2012. I simply could not resist. Price point aside, the melodies and lyrics of Coldplay in this album are worth full price. I'd probably give 4.5 stars to the album, but I bump it up to 5 due to the almost free price tag I had to pay.
0547848412|4.0|Like a fairytale you need to suspend belief - or not. What story do I chose?  Would I prefer life in a boat with or without a companion?  This book is one you think about more after you finish than when you read it. Did I waste hours on reading a tale that is unbelievable, or did I spend hours on a tale that was believable? I still don't know.
B0083GQKQG|5.0|The story of a child who cannot bond to his family or the world. All he knows it the world angers him, the mother who see's him for who he is and the father who pretends he is something else. Wonderful, tragic.<br /><br />Read the book
B007SGM084|3.0|The first book was fun for a while, but by the 2nd book, it's just more of the same. I'll finish the trilogy because I paid for it, but I look forward to being done.
B000W93CXQ|5.0|Throughout my life, many people have come and gone. Some positively influenced me while others not so much. What Jay Asher did was help me through a very difficult time in my life. My sophomore year in high school was the worst year ever. I lost a friend to suicide, then another  to drowning. Although it wasn't easy to get through, I'm glad to have the friends I did who wouldn't let me stay sad and I had this book to help pull me through a lot easier. Thanks for that :)
B008XG1X18|4.0|Pintrest is the place to find out how to do or make anything! I love the recipes and the how-tos. I love getting to share everyones creativity.
B00A757EFW|4.0|Everything is great,I personally miss using the joyce stick.But other than that &#34;Pac Man &#34; is worth getting and I am glad I got it.
1455502758|4.0|This was a most difficult text to read!  It is the last days of Christopher Hitchens!  I've reread this text several times . . . I learn more and more after each reading.  This is definitely not a read for the casual informal afternoon read!  Each page must be savored . . . there are so many lessons to be learned!<br /><br />Yes, I did . . . do love this text!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My daughter has watched this movie several times since she got it and loves it. Good quality merchandise and recieved it in a timely manner. Would deffinately recommend this product and this seller.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|Acting is fine, story is good. Nice camera work.  Excessively violent movie...not suitable for young folks.  I think the same movie could have been made with less extreme violence.
B00AGH6FD8|5.0|A must at Christmas time! Watching Kevin get lost in New York, have fun in a massive hotel room and hurt the bad guys yet again! Same formula as Home Alone 1 but works s charm! One to watch with kids 8 and over !
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Seriously, this is not for children and will be far too frustrating.  The Epic is for teens and adults.  Everyone in our house loves it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read this is one day as I was addicted from the start!  I knew from the dreams that there was a underlying story but never did I imagine the shock I experienced when it was uncovered. I love Sky's witty and blunt personality. I love the never ending devotion Holder has for Sky. And I love that Sky finds truth in the end!
B009P5K4HK|5.0|I am so thrilled with this purchase! It was fast, and is now my favorite CD. I may need another one I play it so much! Thank you
0307352145|4.0|A good read, especially for those of us who have quiet ones in our midst!<br />She does belabor the point somewhat which led me to not finish the book. She could have sliced out about 200 pages and still made her points. I'd still recommend it if you are trying to better understand someone!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Sweet, gentle, comforting is all I have to say about hearing Rod sing traditional Christmas music.<br />This is a nice addition to our collection.
B007HACDLK|5.0|In the tradition of Vince Flynn, &#34;The Last Man&#34; is a thriller that one cannot put down until reading the last page.  I rate &#34;The Last Man&#34; as one of his best.  Can't wait until he publishes his next.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Having the entire series is a really nice way to see the movies.  Seeing Harry and his friends grow and develop was especially good.  The other characters helped to make the story and give depth to the movies.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The 14 by 14 flows are pretty hard, but now I only have a few left.  You have to have a very smart head to get this game and do all of them. You also have to have a very active and imaginative one too!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|What a great movie with tremendous characters and acting.  The way in which the characters were interwoven was so subtle and interesting.  You just don't see better acting.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|I really like this cover.  It holds the KindleFire at whatever angle you like, the kindle is sitting on a slightly sticky surface, so it stays put.  You adjust the angle, set it on at table, and it stays there, at a great angle for viewing.  When done, lift it up, and the case folds closed, like a book.  There is an elastic strap which you can put around the case to hold it together.  It works great, the price was right, and it is very attractive.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|The movie was excellent.  Yes, the acting was a bit stiff, but they are servicemen, not actors.  The story was interesting and the action seens held your interest.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this game it's fun and addictive. the games are easy to play and different then the usual games out there.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|Loser and his teddy bear get a girl and almost lose her...lots of good one liners but that's about it.
B0079R8KXG|2.0|Pretty cheap construction. I've purchased other cover for Kindle keyboard and it was much nicer.  Color is not really true red - more of a washed out color.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|This is nothing more than the smartphone version.  The fonts are huge and there isn't much detail.  Where is the tablet version for Kindle?  Weather Channel has an excellent version for iPad.  Why not here also?
B007UXSPK2|2.0|Slow to start, low energy through out, weak finish. See MI3 for everything this movie wasn't. Spend some quality time with your lady and use this flick as an excuse to snuggle.  ;-)

B007SGLZP8|5.0|As always John Grisham delivers. I found myself hanging on every word. I couldn't wait to turn the page, I kept trying to figure out the end. I like surprise endings. Another book that could be made into a movie.
B005LAII1C|5.0|If you don't like this your not american!  The best movie I have seen in a long time.  And remember the only thing more powerful than a young boy's wish is an Apache Helicopter!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. The author is an amazing writer, she is very detailed which I love. I became hooked and read this story in less than 24 hours. I highly suggest this book if you like reading about survival and if you love action books too. Including a little bit of romance!
B008ELUEQC|4.0|Rod Stewart's Christmas CD was worth the wait! I received it on the 17th so I wont be able to listen to it again until next Christmas at this point but it will be worth the wait then too!
B0084U0IEG|5.0|The writing is impeccable and immediately drew me into the story which was compelling.  The main female character and some of the other characters were sometimes a bit flat and not fully developed but nevertheless a great read.
B000002NHN|5.0|Some of the tunes on this album feature Celtic melodies, and others highlight Middle Eastern sounds, but all are outstanding and a pleasure on the ears.  My favorite on the album was the Prologue, the very first piece, for its contemplative tune and Middle Eastern twangs.  I also really like Marco Polo, another Middle Eastern-inspired piece that is McKennitt's imagining of journeys along the Silk Road.  The music is singular, unlike anything else I've heard, and since I am always seeking originality in music, this is very pleasing to hear.  McKennitt's voice has been described as \\"angelic,\\" and that description seems particularly apt as you listen to her warble and sing and hum and sigh.  Her voice really is amazing, very soothing and pleasant and inspiring all at once.  I'm less enamored with the Celtic hints in her music, though they're well performed and easy on the ears, but that's personal taste, and you may well like the Celtic hints more than the Middle Eastern sounds.<br /><br />The Highwayman is the saddest tune on the album, if you're into lyrics, though it's a good story and well worth listening to.  McKennitt's voice can be soft at times, and it helps to have the lyrics handy so you can be sure of what she's saying.  Whether you call this world music or new age music, it's a collection of unique sounds coupled with interesting lyrics that should give you many hours of listening and re-listening enjoyment.

B001DJLCRC|4.0|The merchandise arrived within a normal time. Packaged well. I like that many episodes are on one disk... its worth a watch....
B0000T70K4|1.0|I love books and it is very rare that I find one as disappointing as Cosmopolis.  I am a creative writing student and am aware of newer fiction genres and even with this perspective Cosmopolis defies explanation.  Had it been written by anyone other than Don Delillo I doubt very much if it would have even made the top of an agent's desk. The main character is dismal, and the book lurches too and fro with at the same speed as the car he is in.  You can skip this one.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|first don't spend your cryistals when it tells you to and make another account then friend yourself on face book well make a bogus facebook account first then everyday (if you want) send yourself crystals then get a friend to send crystals daylie then u get 2 crystals a day plus however much crystal dragon u have hope I helped and GET THIS F****ING APP
B009IF8CH6|5.0|The big bang theory is a very funny show and pretty close to perfect. honestly if I had to say something negative it would be lose the laugh track its distracting if you notice it of someone points it out. But other from that its a great show that will make you laugh.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Excellent book. This is a typical Patricia Cornwell thriller. It holds your interest till the last page. The characters from previous Scarpetta novels continue to grow.
B004XDYJRU|3.0|Cool app that gives you access to radio stations around the country.  Would rate it better if the sound quality was better ,though.  I found the quality too low to use in my car for streaming.  Probably fine off you are playing it through your phone or tablet speakers, but that's it.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I loved this book. A very easy read that keeps you thinking about the book when you're away from it.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I never thought I would actually get into this book but I did! Great story! I'd recommend this book to everyone!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I am giving Wonder a 5 Star rating because it deserves it.  I'm a teacher, and I am going to read this novel to my students next year, because I can teach the importance of kindness.  I can teach them the importance of excepting someone reguardless of how they look.  Yes, this is definitely a book that teaches sympathy, acceptance, and compassion for anyone with a physical anomaly.  =)
B005S9EKCW|4.0|Les Miserables is by no means a pefect film, the performances, in some portions are lacking, and at times the close ups do make the film stagnate slightly, but it is never lacking an emotional 2x4, and hits you right in the gut everytime.  Despite all of it's flaws, it is an exciting and emotional journey that never lets go.<br /><br />Having not read \\"Les Miserables\\" yet, I cannot compare it to the book, nor can I compare it to the stage show, I have not seen that either, I however, listened to the \\"Original London Cast\\" soundtrack for hours at a time as a child and memorized most of the songs.  Up until this film version, I felt Patti Lupone's version of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" was definitive, but I have now changed my mind (more on that later).  In terms of the music and singing, they definitely did a fantastic job, and while the live \\"singing\\" has been done before (opposed to what the Director espouses), and is jarring at first, it proves most effective in a few of the performances primarily in Fantine's songs, a couple of Jean Valjean's (especially the last couple songs he sings), and Eponine's solo.  It does feel a little odd to listen to in the group numbers at times, but once adjusted to, everything sounds just fine.<br /><br />  The story being about so much pain and despair, gives it a lot of emotional punch, and not just for the part's Fantine is in, in the theater I was in, I had people crying all around me in various scenes, especially one of the battle scenes during the French Revolution involving a young boy.  This is what gets audiences, not perfect direction or sound or even perfect singing, but heart and an emotional connection, which is why some critics hate this film.  The direction is at times sloppy, the camera work is surprisingly shaky (which is definitely on purpose, but can make the film sloppy), there is close up upon close up, which is always something critics like to rail about, but in this film, they actually do work.<br /><br />  The one thing about the camera work which was obnoxious, was the constant same shot, and lack of changing angles, but that's not a huge complaint, as that is fairly normal in older films, and this is a movie which, in a way, harkens back to early silent melodramas, the constant closeups, in a way, remind me of \\"The Passion of Joan of Ark (1928)\\", I am in no way comparing the quality of both films, but the technique of the shots used in this film, they are used for similar effect, as they were in Joan of Ark.  Keeping that in mind, the closeups didn't seem quite as meaningless, but they did actually serve a purpose, and for audiences at least, the trick seemed to work.<br /><br />  As a musical, it works well, music is all fantastic and the big musical numbers are exciting and fun, and for a nearly 3hr film, the pace is kept brisk, while at times, it was hard to discern what the point of the story really was, interest was never lost in th3e characters, and never stopped caring about them, especially Jean Valjean and Fantine.  Even by the end i did care about Javert, no Russel Crowe's singing isn't perfect, and as a singer and voice teacher, his lack of vibrato and zero usage of the diaphragm to sing was slightly irritating, but he conveyed the emotions in the songs, especially his last song \\"Javert's Suicide.  Unfortunately Amanda Seyfreid keeps getting type cast in to the ingenue-type roles, which are easy to criticize her for, but she plays the role effectively, and technically, has some of the best singing in the lot besides Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway, but she does at time, seem slightly disconnected emotionally while singing.<br /><br />  Anne Hathaway, some may remember, was actually originally considered to play Christine in the \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" film, but that ended up going to Emmy Russom instead.  Though Hathaway did sing in \\"Ella Enchanted\\", and is, I believe classically trained, with that in mind, her fantastic singing in this came as no surprise, however,the range of emotion she has while singing is more than impressive, and as priorly mentioned, her rendition of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" exceeds far and above all other renditions to date.  The way she doesn't just sing the words, but feels them is what a musical should be like, and it is the best section of the film by far.<br /><br />  The film as flawed as it may be, knows its core audience, and has reached far beyond it well to connect with many people, and not just musical lovers.  There were people crying all around me in the theater I was in as I allready have said, but they were also gasping and even screaming in some parts.  People felt what was on the screen in this film more than any other film I have seen, and it just goes to show, a film does not have to be perfect to connect with an audience, it just has to have a heart.<br /><br />God Bless ~Amythe range of emotion she has while singing is more than impressive, and as priorly mentioned, her rendition of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" exceeds far and above all other renditions to date.

B00846REIS|4.0|Similar to 50 Shades of Grey, but better! The premise of the book is much more grown up and interesting than 50 shades. I really enjoyed it and look forward to reading more.
B003UAMWWQ|5.0|One of the best Mel Brooks' film and I love Rick Moranis(too bad he retired). I would definitely recommend this to every one!

B000GTJT0C|1.0|Although the DVD was brand new, it would not play a) on four different DVD players in my home or b) on the DVD drives on three different computers.  It was a total and frustrating disappointment, and I will not purchase any more such items online again.<br />H C Jones MD
B004JN1D2I|3.0|If I had time to be continually tied into these books, i think they would be great. It was very difficult to track characters and remember who was who when I only had time to pick them up once or twice a week.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is one book I can't find at yard sales.  It's hard to get at the library too and since I'm on a tight schedule I may not finish the book for a month or two so I needed a copy for when I'm ready to read.  Makes you realize &#34;life isn't fair&#34; but life &#34;is what it is.&#34;

0525953728|5.0|This was a great book, easy to read and follow the story line.  Mark Owen did a good job both in real life as a Seal and as the writer relating his experience to the reader.  As a retired Military man I felt like I was there with the team and couldn't put it down.  To me this book represented History and I like studying History.  Thanks.  JJF

B00APUQH0W|5.0|Few movies these days seem to be worth my time. This was a pleasant surprise and I enjoyed it from start to finish. Great plot, meaning and acting. The bad language was light and there was no nudity, and only one small scene of suggested violence.
B005DOL0R0|4.0|Very good quality for the price. Would have liked it if it also included something kind of stand conversion though.
B00005UKKF|5.0|This DVD brings back so many memories.  It defines the era in which it was released.  The whole \\"futuristic\\" vibe is so funny to look back at.  It seems so retro but it was cool to see where Britney was back in those days!  I always find it so ironic that this concert featured a clip of her bald...kinda like telling the future which would come in 2007.  Overall, it's something that you need to own with your Britney collection if you are a fan.

B009CPJHY4|2.0|I'd seen the movie several months before purchasing it after it was recommended by a friend.  Having recently spent almost five months in southeast Asia the setting left me longing to be back &#34;on the road&#34;......and back in the color and the chaos that is so much of Asia.  The cast is superb, the dialog well written, the story.....though certainly not profound.....is good theater.  Sometmes funny, sometimes sad, both simple and complex.  My problem....and the reason my rating is so low....is that the disk I received is clearly defective and will be returned as soon as I dig myself out of the snow drifts.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Just as beautiful the second time around. Charlie is a beautiful human being and its a grand journey that I was happy to take with him.
B009VB97EY|4.0|If you're looking for oscar performances or oscar anything don't put this one on the top of your wanted list.  But if you just want to have fun.......and you like a little (or a lot of) skin.....it's great.  Simple.....but great.
B008RNGCAO|5.0|Holy heck that graphic novel was amazing bought the rest of the series too can't wait to finish them yay
B007THA4FI|4.0|This book is well written and the characters nicely drawn. It's very, very British and might not be for every American reader. A character-driven rather than plot-driven book, and with the mixed reviews I wasn't sure what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised. Hope she keeps writing...

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|The Anker HPLGM needs to be very good to get a permanent place atop my Func F30.R mousing surface. I'm happy to report that it is; my Logitech G5 is finally retired.<br /><br />After thousands of hours of FPS gaming, I have developed very high standards for my gaming environment. A mouse's button placement, mechanical functionality, body shape, size, weight, and software can all have a big impact on your gaming experience. I am very happy with the Anker's quality in all of these dimensions.<br /><br />Pleasant surprises:<br />- The mouse is EXTREMELY light without the added weights. I love this, especially considering the mouse doesn't sacrifice comfort\support or the feeling of solid construction.<br />- I was worried about the placement of two of the three thumb buttons. They look like they're too easy to press considering how much more important your thumb is for moving the mouse than for pressing buttons. I would consider the mouse unusable if this was a problem, but luckily it's not. In fact, the default binding of the thumb buttons to \\"control\\", \\"shift\\", and \\"alt\\" has been really useful in-game.<br /><br />Note:<br />- Although the teflon feet are big and the mouse glides really well, I'd like the feet to be thicker, wider, and closer to the edges. This is true of any mouse with which I've ever tried to game, though.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|My son needed the book for a school report.  It was convenient for him to use this and was easier to keep track of than a typical paperback and it won't sit on a shelf afterward either.
B0063IH60K|5.0|One of the best solitaire games I've played on an Android device. Very smooth .graphics and lots of options to customize the game to your taist
B001EN71DG|5.0|Showed up early, no scratches on the dvd and it has THE ORIGINAL movies on disc 2!!! The only problem was I already owned them!! (disc two says bonus disc, so we never thought to check it) It did however help two households realize they owned the proper versions and fall in love with star wars all over again!
1607066017|5.0|The art is fantastic and the story is great! I picked this up on a whim because I had noticed the comic book covers at the comic shop and liked the artwork... the book did not disappoint! I actually went out and picked up the next couple issues where the trade left off and I can't wait for more.
1401322786|4.0|Our family enjoyed this book so much we ordered one for another family member in addition to 3 other books by Mitch.  Mitch Albom has a way of making the reader identify with the stories he writes and this one did not let us down! We look forward to many more adventures from this great author!
B00005614N|5.0|simply brilliant.<br />Up there with Kind Of Blue by Miles Davis.<br />Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong are GIANTS OF JAZZ and on this recording they<br />are simply brilliant.......Satchmo (Armstrong) has groung his band to jam the Dukes tunes<br />and it works SO WELL...it swings...it has everything.....i give it 5 stars, but if it was a score<br />out of 100, it would get 99.<br />BUY IT< you will have happy ears.
B001U0HAZM|4.0|If you dont pay attention to the beginning and understand it, the rest of the movie you will never understand. If you are a Christian  Bale fan you will be riveted to his character and think how good any movie would be if all the actors put in 110% like Christian.
B005R32L66|4.0|when the signal is good, its terrific but often it is is not.  the interface needs works , its hard to find a few operations like confirming a  contact request and some orher ordinary operations
B009AZZ6H8|5.0|Soundgarden to me is one of the bands that I wish I could be in if I had any talent. You know how in your head you make up this cool-ass group of  dudes who have a God given ability to entertain millions and you are in it! And of course you have such an incredible voice that you don't even have to play any instrument even though you can. Yeah that's this band.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Perfect for what I intend it to be.  I use it for to-do lists and making short reminders for myself.
B001FB563E|5.0|Whether its the dollar decline or  the PIGS ( Portugal, Italy , Grease ,Spain) who start the Apoplectic result , the scenes in this film are so believable because it seems everyone thinks the S is gona hit the fan sooner rather than later and your mind gives you a video much like this scary ass movie. But its S  L  O  W  so be prepared to have a lot of time to be depressed until the very end where you are depressed. Try to prepare by watching in a room and equipment that makes the most of the sound and cinematography put into this movie. Crank it and start thinking like a survivor-list
1401322786|5.0|All of Mitch Album's book are fantastic.  They are thought provoking and relate to day to day life.  Good read.

B003YFIUW8|5.0|great book that really makes you think!  like the other reviews i cant say too much without giving away too much!  i cant imaging living my life like that its so terrifying!  i liked how she wrote from the childs perspective, although it was weird at first, you get used to it.  i would totally recommend this!

B001HNE3NO|5.0|im so glad i read this book!  not only a great book, i learned so much!  a heartbreaking tale of the french role in the holocost, the author does a great job of drawing you into the story, alternating between the past and present.  i dont want to say too much in order not to give up too much of the plot, but it kept me so interested i didnt  want to put the book down!

0316056871|2.0|I know a lot of people love this book, but for me, it was just too slow and, frankly, boring.  I didn't think it was all that funny and you'd sort of have to be really interested in her career.  There wasn't all that much about her as a person, just the trip she took on her career path.  There's nothing terrible about it, but there's nothing great either.  Overall, a dud in my opinion.
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|Boring, Stupid, Dumb, Etc. Amazon needs to find more decent apps. They need more better apps. I give this a Thumbs Down. I mean, Really?<br /><br />#1 Amazon Customer
B00APUYN0I|4.0|my wife and I chose this as a just for fun pick and were so surprised to laugh even more! Great cast of characters with some cool twists on music both old and new! We highly recommend! A next level acting performance would have made it 5 stars but still super enjoyable!
B004V6BQ3O|5.0|Very nice sound quality, great stereo separation all in a very small package, would recommend this for your Nikon DSLR with video capability.
B005K17RU0|5.0|When I first installed it, I was blown away by the graphics presentation.  Also, weather data is laid out in a sensible fashion.  Easy to get an overview on the summary page and enough detail on the 15 day forecast.  Also provides a radar view.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I saw this movie at the theater. It was the best bond movie I have seen. A lot of action. I wanted a copy of my own so I pre-order a Blu-Ray) disk  from amazon.com
B004GYY714|5.0|Nice thing about this app is, it will locate local AM and FM radio stations.  Set stations from a city about 50 miles away as our favorites.  We are in the country side and radio reception is distorted at times.  With this app on a Kindle Fire or iPad Touch, we get perfect reception of our favorite stations.  Add to that an Altec Lansing M650 speaker unit for the iPad and we can have our favorite music continuously in the house or on the patio.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|This soundtrack is amazing. If you are a Les Mis fan or a fan of Broadway music, the soundtrack is a must have. It honors the original while still being fresh and updated. The new song blends with the original songs so well that you hardly notice it's new. A+ for all the actors vocals. Love it!!
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|Anne Hathaway steals the show in this recording, along with newcomer Samantha Marks. They are fantastic. I'm not a huge fan of Hugh Jackman's voice (or Russell Crowe for that matter) but after seeing the movie it is very emotionally gripping. Their nasal qualities do not render them the best choices for Valjean and Javert in my opinion. A guest appearance by a favorite makes it all, though.
B0083TXXZ4|4.0|Bought this for my 14 year old son's birthday.  He owns several of these Nerf guns.  They all have different purpose for them.  His two favorite are a single shot snipper rifle for it's accuaracy and distance.  This one though finishes the battle every time.  It lays down so many shots at one time that the other player doesn't have a chance.  It is not super accurate but when you are letting lose that many darts who has to be.<br /><br />The package only comes with 4 cartridges that each hold 6 darts.  I bought him the expander package which came with an additional 4 cartridges.  If you want to reach the max capacity you would need to buy the larger cartridges.  These only hold 6 darts.<br /><br />Overall a nice gift but if you want it to reach it full capacity just be aware that you will need to buy more stuff.
B001706I5I|5.0|Great movie. My grandchildren ages 4 and 6 loved it and learned some good lessons about the true meaning of Christmas.

B0063GORYU|5.0|I like spider and play it often.  You can't beat the price.  It does have ads however you can skip them and continue playing the game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I chose this rating because this is for the best and this book is the best . I personally could not put it down
B008Z9L94O|4.0|....i just wish this vinyl collection looked like the original vinyl collection without the &#34;box set&#34; feel to it. this is my least favorite pumpkins album, but it was the most difficult and expensive to find as vinyl. this reissue makes it worth having. the remixing is nice, too, really pumped up some of the quiet mixing of the original.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Just started reading books with the Kindle.  this was a whole new concept for me.  Like it much better than a real paperback
B006Z21ZJC|5.0|I Realy loved the product. Is one of the bests Iron Maiden dvd show. But the delivere late more than four months. I needed to inform the Amazon about the late and buying again to receive my DVD. The Steel Box came damage. But no problem.
B003O86FMW|5.0|catchy name for a catchy book, just as good as the first book in the series that caught on fire
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|My wife really enjoyed reading all these books. I'm thinking she would recommend these either on the kindle,hardcover or paperback.
0143038583|4.0|Fascinating, if disturbing in its revalations regarding our food and eating culture. There;s things  Ican do to change my personnal habits but I odn't know how we'll ever change our mass cultural habits, with our heads under the food industry's corporate boot heels.
0439023521|5.0|the title may sound plain but thats how i am but the book overall is way more gruesome and threatening about the details rather than the movie check it out.
B007HO392S|4.0|Carrie Underwood is awesome as always.  Loved the title song already.  Lots of good songs on the rest of the album which surprised me since I only paid $5.  I thought it was just a single CD, so was surprised to get it and realize it was an entire album of songs.  Got it sooner than expected as well.
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|Although this book has a sad ending, overall this book is the best I have read so far, and I will read this over and over again.
0375413405|5.0|This book is a must have for every cook. Teaches the cooking basics. Well written, well presented. Thank goodness for Julia Child!
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|This product was ok.  I expected a bit more than what it delivered but, it wasn't to bad so I gave it three stars
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Es un buen producto,<br />La negociación fue efectiva, se hizo de manera rápida, segura y confiable.<br />Recomiendo 100% el producto y el vendedor.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Not as crass and trashy as I was expecting, this movie has more heart and a lot less boobs than I would've guessed. It's just a really strange movie - not as laugh out loud funny or as overtly offensive as a lot of Seth MacFarlane's other work.
B002BWP49C|5.0|So glad to get this part 1 breakingdawn and can't wait until part 2 comes out for sale! I will be purchasing it to complete my set.
1426308469|5.0|My 6 yr old son loves this book.  I catch him looking at it at night after he is supposed to be asleet.  It is a pretty comprehensive dinosaur reference for little guys.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|So enjoyed this movie when it came out. So I knew I wanted to own it for future viewings. Awesome!
B005LAIH4A|3.0|Good movie for only $3.99.  My daughter didnt take to it as well as she does her Disney movies but, I really appreciate the enviromental spin on a kids movie!
B005NJU8PA|5.0|This is more a book about how to quickly learn anything than a simple cookbook. It is well written, interesting writing. The few recipes are good. The cooking principles taught are what make it an outstanding cookbook.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This was a fantastic book, a great insight into foster care as well as an interesting education on the meaning of specific flowers. I loved this book.
B00A83075M|5.0|Being raised in the age of Atari, Pac-Man and (classic) Nintendo, I was even more excited than my kids to see this film. The only drawback I saw when I first viewed the trailer was that Sarah Silverman was cast at what seemed like an extremely annoying character, which did not surprise me since I am not that fond of her comedy. Nevertheless, I jumped at the chance when my kids said they wanted to see this! The first thing I marveled at was the short cartoon that preceded the film, \\"Paperman\\" -- a simple story about a man who struggles to find a woman with whom he met early in his work day. This short is a wonderful testament to the yearning of breaking out of life's monotony and searching for something better. And that is a perfect warm-up for \\"Ralph,\\" a film itself that centers around this theme. Oh, and I WANT composer Christophe Beck's musical score for this (it's one of the best I've heard in years; including in feature films!)<br /><br />Ralph (Reilly) is a villain who yearns to break out of his \\"bad guy persona\\" and become a hero by winning a medal. The only problem is that, in his game, the medal ALWAYS goes to its protagonist Fix-It Felix, Jr. (McBrayer). So, despite great dangers of permanently erasing (dying) in another game, Ralph ventures to other game worlds so that he may win his medal. Along the way, of course, he meets various characters, including Lynch's Sergeant Calhoun and Alan Tudyk's King Candy. I could tell that by watching the trailer. What I didn't know was that this film would be such an ensemble piece, there would be an evil conspiracy subplot, and that I would come to LOVE Silverman's character, Vanellope von Schweetz, a character who is a wonderful role model for my girls and other little girls in a world where racing and \\"boys stuff\\" is still considered for boys. The role that Ralph takes on during the film is surrogate father or big brother to Vanellope, and I have to admit that at the very end of the movie, Ralph makes a move in which any father can relate and tears started to well in my eyes! This film has got wonderful performances, wonderful writing and classic video game characters (Q*Bert, Root Beer Tapper, Zangief) as well as voice cameos from well-known actors (Mindy Kaling, Ed O'Neill, Dennis Haysbert, Edie McClurg, Adam Carolla, and Horatio Sanz)! This movie also has plenty of heart! It falls in with [[ASIN:B001KVZ6FW Up (Single-Disc Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B00275EHJG Toy Story 3]] as my favorite animated movies EVER!any father can relate and tears started to well in my eyes!

B000HT386M|4.0|Very one has to like at least one Sandler film.  This is my favorite. I can't believe it but this guy has become iconic.
B007REV4T8|5.0|For those who did not know that the Daniel Craig James Bond films have been prequels to the Bond movies we all know and love, this movie will definitely prove that point! Of course, it stands that the entire trilogy (of the new installments) has been a reboot, but by the end of this film, we're placed in the spot that all of us Bond fans know of our favorite spy. I was worried about director Sam Mendes directing this film as he hasn't done any serious action-packed films. Fortunately, my fears were put to rest. This film has got all the action, a wonderful Bond song (provided by Adele), and a really good story that introduces the important Bond characters of the mythology. However, there is one small caveat here. Sometimes it is not good to be a cinephile and someone who's seen a s***load of movies. Because then, you can't help but notice storylines that get recycled. Case in point: this film. Don't get me wrong, the story is good, the dialogue great, the acting superb. BUT ... the overall plot is something we've seen before in the James Bond saga. Anyone recall [[ASIN:B000M53GM2 GoldenEye]], which starred Pierce Brosnan as Bond? Remember the villain Alec Trevelyan (played by a pre-\\"Lord of the Rings\\" Sean Bean)? Well, Trevelyan is a fellow 00 agent who fakes his death and spends the film exacting revenge on MI6 for their involvement in his parents' death. Sounds vaguely familiar with this film's antagonist Raoul Silva (a.k.a. Tiago Rodriguez) (Javier Bardem), who exacts revenge on MI6 for \\"betraying\\" him. I had the same slight problem with [[ASIN:B005LAIHXQ Prometheus]]; a great film but the story is the same overall story structure as the original [[ASIN:B00011V8IQ Alien (The Director's Cut)]].<br /><br />On a different note, it's interesting that this film is a prequel and yet, it features Judi Dench as M, which carries over from \\"GoldenEye\\" (the film she was first inducted in to play M). It's like it went full-circle. So is this a prequel or just a continuation of the saga? Either way, it's an excellent story. Standouts in the film were Ben Whishaw as Q (YES!!!!) and Naomie Harris as Eve (who holds her own with Bond -- wink, wink). Overall, \\"Skyfall\\" is enjoyable, action-packed, Javier Bardem plays a great villain, and Craig's vulnerability was needed and well done. This is a definite must-see and one of the best Bond films ever!of the saga? Either way, it's an excellent story.

B000H6FHLY|5.0|We love Schleich, and how sturdy, and well made they are. This little guy is very cute, and a great addition to our old west collection.
B00136JQMI|5.0|This album truly deserves to be a multi-platinum label. I have heard Davis's songs on the radio and elsewhere but this is one of his best works and I would recommend this to anyone who likes (or would like to check out) Jazz.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This was a gift for my husband so he could start watching it with our son. He was very happy to receive the entire set with lots of extras (what I like), in such a small package. So far, our 5 year old has just watched episode IV with us and liked it. I think he is ready to see the next one. I think our order will be episodes 4,5,1,2,3, then 6.
B004LROUNG|5.0|This one is right up there with his best.  Grisham books are hard to put down and this one was no exception.
B000ICXQGK|5.0|I love love this movie. Robin williams is my favorite. I have streamed to by tablet, as well as purchased this for a friend.
B004U52VPS|5.0|My 4 yrs old son got it as a gift and he is loving it.  At 1st he was frustrated w setting it up because it keeps coming down and unable to aim to get the pigs down. But I teach him about stable ground and balance when setting up. I also teach him projectile so he knows the distance of the sling and where to aim. Great physics teaching toy for young kid. He can play by himself or play with us. The toys are just light plastic - would b nice if there is a little more weight to wood shape pieces.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I loved this book. Pi is a wonderful character and his story of survival and coping is amazing. I recommend this to all
B000KJT8IG|5.0|I already have this movie, of course, as it is somehwat of a classic to me.  But it was so much clearer on Blu Ray.  Especially the cartoon part in the beginning.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This app could not find weather for my zip code in west central Florida.  It kept bringing up weather for another zip code that is 25 or 30 miles away. Does not have one hundredth of the functionality of computer based weather channel web site. Totally useless for me. Worth what it cost me -- nothing.
B00ARAO720|3.0|The movie was enjoyable, but cheesy. The story line was a little lame and the obsession with the cop and the messenger Wilee was stupid.  All-in-All it was an OK movie and a perfect rental.
B00631VJIC|5.0|my hubby is a musician & SOA fan so it was a natural to give this this CD for Xmas...we were both blown away & play it ad infinitum!!  enuf said..go for it!!
B004SRNH10|5.0|Needed this for GGPO, Fast download and installs rather quickly. What else can I say about this other than it's great.
145210655X|5.0|This book is full of hilarious cartoons and captions. It had me in stitches as a father and a Star Wars fan. Anyone else who is both should get this book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works amazingly. Customizable background is a wonderful touch. Has everything you would want from a Solitare program.<br /><br />I have no issues with it.
B00846REIS|5.0|a great follow up if you loved fifty shades of grey. more descriptive and better written than fifty of grey.
B0013BCWEW|5.0|Great movie with on the edge and eery scenes. Bluray quality is excellent. I would recommend it as a must see movie. Even the packaging was eery looking...as if it was sent by a questionable mailer. I will keep the movie just as it was sent to me.
B00002N9ER|5.0|This is my 3rd set of clips.  I have lights mounted in my garage, on the side of the seat in my Jeep for easy access.  these work great!
B006P0FIB0|3.0|Not a terrible movie. And the 3D is pretty good. Nothing great, but if you have a 3DTV, worth a look.
1419705849|5.0|Bought two...my youngest son had it read in a few hours.  Great book sereis for kids!  Can' t wait for the next!
B008J34466|5.0|I was very happy with this purchase.  I have listened to this many times since I purchased it.  One of my favorites is the title track &#34;The Truth About Love&#34;.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|LOVE IT. This CD is in my top 5 favorite CD's to listen to.  I've purchased some for gift too.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I was very happy with this purchase.  Speedy delivery and in great condition!  Grey's Anatomy is one of the best shows on prime time television!
B009CGYO0K|1.0|not readable on any of my devices not even cloud reader.  I love the Oatmeal but this is really only formatted for a kindle. To be fair to amazon the page I brought it from does have a list of devices it works on I just didn't notice and it wasn't obvious.
B00A3DZ61W|2.0|I was disapponted that the only option available was to pay $2.99.  I like the game, sound effects are fun.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|Game of thrones is awesome. Blu ray disk makes it that much better. Start of a very big collection... .
B001D0DQUC|5.0|This is a funny movie and one that can be watched many times for a laugh.  It's also a movie to be enjoyed by the next generation.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Had this game for my ds. Had this game on my ipod. I enjoy them all and have played all the games.<br />Still play them.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|As usual G5 has put out an awesome hidden object adventure game!!! Perfect combo of hidden object scenes, point and click adventure, mini games, and storyline.  Worth every cent of $4.99 and excellent bargain for anything less.  Outstanding quality and length of game. Keep them coming G5!!!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Very entertaining!<br />I can now play this game on a bigger screen and I like it.<br />Will recommend this to others.
0307887448|5.0|If you have any connection to the 80s, you'll love this book. I'm not a gamer and never have been (except for some wild dabbling in text-based adventures way back), so a lot of references probably sailed right over my head, but no matter. I loved this book. It's thrilling and immersing adventure tale with a surprisingly big heart.
B0086700CM|4.0|I played this on friends ipods so I thought I would try it on the kindle.<br />It is better on the kindle.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince has done it again with another great Mitch Rapp adventure. I am already looking forward to his next book.
B005MYEPXC|5.0|My husband, a novelist, was so enthralled bt this movie when we rented it that I bought it as a stocking stuffer for him.  It was his favorite gift!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Reviews seem really mixed on this one but both my husband and I really liked it. Just enough of everything I like in a movie, story line, action, a lot of good special effects. Noomi Rapace was excellent in this movie and Michael Fassbender was a real 'creep'.
B005HSG3VK|3.0|I liked how lightweight it is, but was disappointed in the way it worked when trying to make it stand alone.  The cover keeps slipping out from the groove.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|I do not understand why this show was not highly rated.  I loved it.  This movie was entertaining, funny, and action-packed.<br />So many said it was like watching Transformers - I did not.  Doesn't it stand to reason that aliens (good and bad) from another planet would have double-duty spaceships that do multiple tasks - that is what I saw.  Transformers talk, these multiple-purpose ships do not.  If you want to simply be entertained, and learn a great deal about the Navy - what really goes on in a ship and gives a WONDERFUL TRIBUTE TO THE USS MISSOURI  - then buy this movvie.
B009CCBCU4|5.0|To me this book is great because it took me into a time travel journey to Aztecs times comparing it with today's Mexico. A fictional view with historical background. All the time I was thinking, I lived next to that, passed through there. And the nahuatl, what memories it brought, names we Mexicans sometimes take for granted. I thank the author for her passion and love for the Aztecs and the other cultures and races in those times, and for bringing us another view besides the blood sacrificing Aztecs and the conquest. This is placed before, the time where all was being built, a time where many don't know. And the story of the fictional characters was great, with a great twist at the end!
B007SGM084|5.0|I really enjoyed reading these books. I haven't read a good book in a while and I read all 3 in less than a week. The books made me feel a part of the plot. I would like to see a movie of the books.
B001706I5I|4.0|Just a &#34;head's up&#34; for parents of young pre schoolers.  This probably wont work for them.  Just do the original.  And move on to other matters! ; )
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read all of John Grisham's books and this one was different from the rest in a good way. I highly recommend it!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|i can edit my pictures so god pretty it works fine and has no problems it edits just the way i feel like it just awsome if u dont know if u should download it i think u absolutely should
B0001IN07Q|3.0|The Cd in this package is good if maybe a bit dull in the choice of standards that follow a bit too closely to the Sinatra originals. I was a huge sinatra fan when I was young but I personally find Buble the more exciting artist nowadays. The DVD part of this package is quite horrible to sit through, employing so many gimmicky visual techniques, quick cuts, hand-held camera, switching pointlessly from color to black & white, overlapping fades, super punchy zooms etc. You would employ these techniques if you were trying to hide the faults of a boring and charisma free pop star, but for an exciting and accomplished performer/entertainer it just becomes irritating.<br />Worse still, shots clearly taken from different nights are cut to seem as though it is all in one performance. It almost turns the unique quality of a filmed live concert into a demented extended music video. The concert DVD of Michael Buble called 'Caught in the Act' is far superior and everything a filmed concert should be, you get to see and appreciate the art of everyone on stage and it is beautifully shot with the cameras in the right places at the right times. There is also a DVD called 'Michael Buble meets Madison Square Garden' that is equally exciting in it's concert portions but is interspersed with lots of behind the scenes stuff and has less songs as a result (although the audience in that one is MASSIVE).
B007SGM084|4.0|I´ve never had so much fun, the female character is sooo inventive, I just loved it from the first page.!!!!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Not only does this keep the kids busy, but also their parents, aunts and uncles!!! Everyones seems to really enjoy this!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Suspense when I wasn't expecting it. Love story with a twist. Can't wait for the next book to come out!
B002JVWR9U|5.0|My daughter loves this series, so I got her them for Christmas. Now all she does is stay in her room and watch them over and over.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I loved this book! I didn't like how descriptive it was during the sexual intercourse but it did seem necessary....wonderful job.
B003L77GH4|5.0|My teenage daughter is hooked!! She finally shows appreciation for something. Now she won't leave her room...I think she loves it
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I found this book very thrilling and exciting. I will just say when you expect something it is the opposite of what you thought.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I got seasons 1-3 as a part of my daughters Christmas gift and to be honest, today is 12/29 and she is still stuck on it, all I hear coming from her room are happy sounds.....I think she loves it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I thought it was a great book because it was funny. The book starts out with Greg telling about his life before he was born. That was my favorite part. As it goes on, a motor/wrestling event somehow Morphed into a Valentin`s day dance.<br /><br />(P.S., I'm a kid)
B009JBZH54|5.0|the gift was for my nephew-in-law.  he is the biggest batman fan ever and was thrilled to receive the gift for christmas.
