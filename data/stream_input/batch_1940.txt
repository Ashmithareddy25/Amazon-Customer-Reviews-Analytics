0345803507|5.0|I loved this books couldnt put them down and Iv started reading them all over again when I was done. I love the end it was a great way to wrap things up. Felt like you got to see them grow and I love the happy ever afters.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I Put this on my 10yr olds Nabi Tablet, now I ask him when is it my turn to play.... LOL
0345803493|5.0|I could not get enough of these two. These books just keep you wraped up and I could never put them down. I would try to hide reading them at work because by now everyone knows whats in these books, everyone has read them and if you havent START with 1 and  bet you will read them all
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|The game Is so fun with scary parts where u turn around AND HE IS<br /> RIGHT THERE!!! I would totally recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good scare. :)
B008O9V4C2|5.0|donald fagen is the albert einstein of music.  what kind of stuff goes through his head?  complex, innovative, and wonderful.  he is truly one for the ages.  i am never dissapointed with his offerings.  i'm not a music critic, but i know that his stuff is a refreshingly welcome relief from the crap that's out there today.  the man is a genius.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was a book that you really had to read. You had to pay attention. You also had to have some knowledge of the part of history that King was writing about or some of it wouldn't make sense. I was in high school when President Kennedy was killed so I was familiar with the history.<br />One of the other things that I loved about this book was the mention of characters and things from some of his other books. Like a white over red Plymouth Fury, his inclusion of the town of Derry, and others (I don't want to spoil things). King fans will recognize these things and smile or nod their heads but a first time reader won't lose track of the story because they don't recognize them. They are kind of like seeing him play small parts in the movies that have been made of his books.<br />The idea of time travel from the mind of Stephen King is fascinating to say the least, just like any other subject that he has chosen to write about. I LOVED it. This book is right up there with &#34;The Stand&#34; and &#34;Under the Dome&#34; for me on my favorite list.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|I love these books!!! They just take u in and u get lost in the story!! I love them!! !
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My granddaughters and I enjoy Angry Birds free on the web, but I hesitated to download this free version (I have never paid for a game) because of warnings about the ads. Enticed by the the 5-star reviews, I installed the game on my new KFHD8.9. Yes the game displays full screen ads. Yes they are annoying. But, you don't have to view the ads. Just 1 swipe and two taps turns off the WiFi on the Kindle. After that we play for hours ad-free.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I like this game but am confused that it is so small.  I would like a little larger version, it would make it easier to see, even with glasses on.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|this book is one of the best things I've read. Be ready to cry like a baby and laugh your butt off.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I have this game on my computer and love it.  I like that you have to make matches in a timely manner.
B006QS0PF0|5.0|Totally recommended, is a true story that make me laugh, cry, think and reconsider stuff in my life... I'm not anorexic but we all have similar problems in life and we must fight and win the battle!
B005HSL626|4.0|It was a kick and I would tell folks it is fun if you have the time. First time I ever played a game like this so that is all I have to go on at this time.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|This watch is exaclty what I was looking for. Looks nice, but not to fancy. And its extremely comfortable. Very easy to set and easy to read.<br /><br />The only negative is that the watch band is thinner than I expected. But I got use to it quickly.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.<br /><br />This was my second reading and just as enjoyable as the first.<br /><br />I'll be starting my second reading of the second book soon.  I don't know when the last book in the trilogy will be published, but I hope that I don't have to wait too long.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|By far the best science fiction book I have read to date. Incredibly accurate details and a gripping story that will keep you reading far past your bedtime. I just cannot believe it is only ninety-nine cents!
B001O05X2U|5.0|Not every song on this album is a classic, but there are at least 5 or 6 that are so good they seem they will never grow old to me.  Mika is a genious.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|A good excitement pod a conspiracy to over throw a government and there cruel ways. If your not sure about this book just pick it up you won't be disappointed.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Short review from my Kindle. Challenging but always honest. A great app to pass the time. I will definitely be checking out other apps from these guys.
B001AITGWE|1.0|We watched this due to the high review ratings and kept waiting for it to get better.  It never did. The characters were not believable and the storyline was lacking.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|AMAZING BOOK READ IT YOU WILL DEFINITELY LOVE IT ITS SO GOOD I'M TYPING IN CAPITAL LETTERS PLEASE READ IT
B003O86FMW|4.0|The author keeps you in suspense with twists and turns. You find yourself wondering who do I want Katniss  to end up with Peeta or Gale, will there only be one remaining when this game ends, who will it be etc.etc. I am anxious to start the next book.
1419705849|5.0|My son does not enjoy reading but loves this series of books. About 1/3 the price I would have paid at bookstore for same book
B00006RINF|5.0|One of my most favorite albums of all time. Haunting melodies. I am extremely pleased with it. Great price and came on time.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I LOVE the movies. Reasonable price. Fast shipping. Super happy with it. I just wish they had a film box-set with bonus features - extended version, something like that (like the LOTR box-set). I love this one, though.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|It sux. get temple run idiots. this is just a worse copy of it. i mean really wheres the origanallity?
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I'm glad that I have this ap it is handy to check your facebook account. The screen is touchy making it hard to navigate. It jumps all over. When I scroll down it jumps back to the top or you find yourself in places that you didn't want to go. It doesn't compare to being on a computer but again it is good for a quick check in.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|great game. challenging but fun. would recommend if you like mind games and puzzle games. would of liked it to be longer.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is a great book. I would highly recommend it to younger readers too (elementary-high school). Anyone who's bored with reading, I think Ender's Game is a great book to get back into the swing of it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl was the first book I read on my original Kindle.  I had no idea what the book was about.  I went into it blind, and was very surprised with the plot.  The plot angle was original, and the reading experience excellent.  I would read other Gillian Flynn books.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game it is just awesome you have to match and it has 5 levels and all 5 have 30 levels GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0810993139|5.0|I bought this book for a fourth grade student that I tutor in a Saturday reading program.  He really loves the content and even I am entertained as well.
0439023513|4.0|Eventhough this wasn't my style of reading, I enjoyed all three books of the Hunger Games.  The third<br />book was a little drawn out in parts but kept my interest.  Should be interesting to see the movie coming out<br />this year, of Catching Fire.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book book captured me and held me to the end. I never wanted to put it down. I not only loved it but highly recommend it.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|If you can wrap your mind around the stretchs in certain scenes and situations (granted, this is drama/action/adventure and it is a stretch to have a caped super-hero) this is an awsome flick.  While you are rooting for the happy ending and Batman is immortal, etc., the plot takes you to something else.  Great twist in the end.  Didn't see it coming.  Worth the rental.
B0031TZASY|5.0|I've enjoyed that book immenselly. I saw the movie in 3D a couple of weeks ago, it was wonderful and maybe that is why I've enjoyed reading the book so much. It is very well written and the story is amazing.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Similar script, but this one didn't get stupid in the last third like the original did.  Great special effects.  And you can't beat Jessica Beal.  Even if the film didn't show her guns, abs or any other major skin, she still rocks.
0451418433|5.0|Born in 1932, I can relate to the incidents so stirringly portrayed by Ken Follett. I eagerly await the final part of the trilogy
B007R41E8O|5.0|Easy to play. Good story plot. Great graphics. I find it fun and a good way to relax! Some games leave me frustrated but this is very intuitive.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I thought this book was intriguing and it made me want to read the rest of her books as well (which are equally well written).  She has a great way of drawing you into even her unlikable characters.  And then there is always a great plot twist at the end too!
030746363X|5.0|Tim Ferriss is part insanity, part genius, and a good time. Just bought his new book 4 hour Chef and it is great too!
B009IQ0TGM|4.0|Ellie's &#34;Halcyon&#34; is yet another demonstration of the singer's unique vocals.  The songs are catchy and fresh.  I especially love the first two tracks.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|So nice to see every single episode in the correct order.  Much better than waiting for reruns and trying to figure what episode came before.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was worried that the middle book would not be able to hold my interest but it was wonderful. The plot, the twists, the capital's cruelty. I can't wait to start the last book.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I'm reading this series out of order and I finally got to the first and it brought a lot of things home for me.  I got this as the movie came out and then saw the movie.  No comparison.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book is an exciting read. I can't wait to read the rest. It is full of action and makes you think.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great story with all the clues laid out for the alert reader.  Even if your not, the clues come together nicely toward the end of the book and the story has sue nice twists and turns.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is the one app I tell everyone they must download. By no means am I ADD but I'm not the most organized either. Evernote keeps me on top of my game! I use it for EVERYTHING. This, in my opinion, is the most easy to use, productive, free app on the market today.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This book is geared to a person that has tech interests, and the level of tech interest doesn't matter.  I found the book to be a total joy to read and did so in 2 sittings.  Definite reread!
B0098VYCCE|3.0|This has really good special effects and good acting but it was very dark and depressing for a fairy tale.  I wish they would have lightened it up a little.  I like the actress who played snow white but she was not right for this part- the queen was great!
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Just got my I pad and I'm loving this book. Hope to get more. The price is right for a classic, free.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I love these guys in Men in Black!  Crazy characters and I loved the story line.  Good twist at the end that I never saw coming. lots of action and good special effects.  I want to see them make another.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|This app is great and Free!  I like to mix beach, rain, and thunderstorm.  You can save settings so I am not sure what that review was about. Before this, I had tried white noise machines, natural sound card, and the tv to fall asleep but this is the best!  One flaw is that you can detect the cuts in the audio looping, which bugs me a little being a musician, but my husband can't detect them at all.  GREAT APP FOR FREE!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|lots of action and humor.  I liked the story of a rebelious teenage girl- alot of kids can relate to that.  the twins we adorable
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Going threw the channels one night and came upon this show and I've been hooked ever since. I've watched the first season in two days. Waiting for the second season to come out so I can get it..
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Classic John Grisham! Intriguing from the very first page, can't put it down. I haven't even finished it yet, but you have to read this book!!!
B008OOYALE|3.0|I enjoy this game certainly! Though you need patience or money to play it. Things are expensive and unless you do check every hour for the coins your dragons give you it will take a long time to earn money, even doing quests. But it's cute and well created.
B000SEFM6K|5.0|So interesting of a style of communicating the story and what a plot and characters! Best from Wilkie Collins in my opinion.
1582701709|5.0|The is a great sequel to the secret. It is very motivating and contains great tips and inspiring quotes. I would recommend this book to just about anyone.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Can't get enough! I can watch this movie over and over and over again. It has quickly become one of my favorite movies!
B00AF6B22E|4.0|I watch most movies at home lately, but I decided to go to the theater to see this one. If I would have known the beginning was going to make me feel like I had paid to watch porn, I would have waited to rent the digital so I could skip that part. If this is a spoiler, I apologize, but I did not need to see a completely nude woman walking around a hotel room for about - I don't know, maybe ten minutes.<br /><br />Flight is about more than just a plane crash. When I viewed the trailer, I didn't expect this movie to be so gritty. Not a fan of gritty. There is drug use, nudity and quite a bit of profanity. Still, all in all, this is a good film. Whip (Denzel Washington) was a drunk, arrogant, drug-addicted pilot in a lot of pain. The whole struggling to get sober and stay sober was so real and educational even. Denzel's performance was great! I also think John Goodman did a terrific job and all other performances were good.<br /><br />Favorite line: \\"No one could have landed that plane like I did. No one.\\"<br />And the faith element - so well done I gave this gritty film four stars instead of three.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved this book couldn't put it down. Mira did an amazing job recommend it to anyone that is looming for a good book
B00APUYWYA|5.0|story line is very predictable yet still enjoyable. but who cares! the music is spectacular! i actually purchased the sound track afterwards - love those songs!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book is awesome u should read it. Read the whole series plus Percy Jackson first before this series. B-)
B001MNFOIW|3.0|ok performances, no so predictable story line.<br />I like James McAvoy and his portait of a lot of characters, but not so much for this one - it's certainly not his best role
B0053TMP24|5.0|I read the Percy Jackson series and it was good then I read the heroes of olympus it was good too I can't wait to read the mark of Athena B-)
B006G2124E|5.0|spectacular cast! true to the book, except for the changes about Constantine's daughter - which I think is great!<br />If you love the book, you'll be moved by the movie!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was amazing cried so many times. She should make some from Pets, Gale, and other people's point of view.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book is more fast pace than the last and includes the more exciting characters in the series.<br /><br />If you enjoy the series, then you should purchase this one.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this game is awesome I love it so much I'm level 4 or 5 agin this game is awaome I love it
B0061PEAUY|4.0|This book was all over the place, in subject matter, kept me guessing where it was going, a must read
B009HELT3C|3.0|There is virtually none of the sharp humor of the first MIB here.  Comedy sequels are rarely any good at all and this is barely decent thanks in large part to Josh Brolin.  Will Smith does a lot of wacky stunts and there's lots of CGI critters.  Etc. etc.  Not great but if you want to see it, it's not terrible.  Better than MIB 2.
B005HSL626|4.0|It's a fun game but didn't hold attention very long My take is it needs some variety to be better
B0001RVP88|1.0|The disc I bought was shipped from England, which meant that it was in District II and couldn't be played by a machine in North America. They were cool about taking it back and giving me a refund, however, and I found it in my public library for free.
0345803493|5.0|Exciting, well crafted and above all - if you don't surface read and can look beyond how Christian's therapy for love making, you would find a love story of compassion, trustworthiness and honesty.  Ms. James, you did an awesome job with entirer series.  Great read...
B00APUQPX6|3.0|Scrat (the saber-toothed squirrel) rules!  Fun movie, but not as good as the first.  The monkey's a bit weird, though.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|draw a stickman epic is a neat game. really smare people that created this game. how do I tint the second puzzle pieces on winter land.
B007N3GZ9C|5.0|Stimulating, insightful, gripping story.  Just amazing to learn what she went through, and more importantly, how she recovered.  Just a superb story!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app!!!!  I like learning. of new ways to use this to make my busy life more organized.  Thank You. keep up the good work!!!
1451627297|3.0|This book already has so many reviews here that this one will undoubtedly get lost in the shuffle.  Rather than repeating what has already been said 2,000 times, I'd just like to add that Mr. King should not base his present-day opinions of Dallas on the pawn shops and bars he visited in the parts of town where Oswald lived 50 years ago. Had he chosen to visit the city's world-class museums, restaurants and performance halls he might have a more cultured view of the city's citizens and amenities.  Every person in Maine isn't a lumberjack.  Every person in Dallas isn't a redneck.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|A book that all should read, given the shortage of time in our busy lives.  Prompts thought and contemplation once finished.
B000SEFDP0|5.0|A comprehensive, comical and ominously prescient post-modern look at every conceivable conspiracy theory imaginable. And then some.  Shea's work is worth a read for those with open minds who don't take things too seriously.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Ok so this game is fun and all BUT one thing that I don't like is that when you tap on the \\"monsters\\" they don't always do what they need too. If you can tolerate that then GET THE GAME!!!!!!!! if they can fix this problem then it's worth 5 stars. (important if it's easy) this game only has 3 levels so far because it's new so I'm sad that I can't play anymore because I don't like replaying games. OK GO DOWNLOAD IT AND STOP READING THE REVIEWS FOR THIS GAME! I GAVE YOU ALL THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW! :)
B003JTHXOK|3.0|****SPOILER ALERT****<br /><br />If you've seen \\"Sleeping with the Enemy\\", you'll be familiar with this story. A bit of a twist at the end, but you have to read 95% of the book to get there.<br /><br />Good writing and definitely interesting...just not very original.
0525478817|4.0|&#34;The Fault in Our Stars&#34; is a beautifully written book which completely changed my aspect on cancer patients and survivors.<br /><br />The views expressed by Hazel and Augustus are genius, but are almost unbelievably genius for people of their age. I understand that they are supposed to be wise beyond their years, but the complexity of their thoughts and relationship would be easier for me to believe even if the characters were two years older. A minor detail.<br /><br />I loved this book, but even so it seemed rushed to me. Green's &#34;Looking for Alaska&#34; and &#34;Paper Towns&#34; are written in perfect detail and bring you through twists and turns; &#34;The Fault in Our Stars&#34; was almost begging to be more free.<br /><br />However, this is an amazing story with amazing perspectives overall.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It starts out talking about when Greg was a baby and how he was the third wheel and Greg was at school and they had to find a Valentine
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I picked this rating because the book is just put together well and I love it it's definitely one of my favorites.
B0086700CM|3.0|This is such a fun game, but it is SO glitchy, so I can't turn or jump most of the time. On my best friends kindle fire HD it works fine!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Child has done it again. Only he can make a hobo a hero. Cannot  wait for the next one. Reacher is awesome.
B008ALA6DW|4.0|I use this product to have a constant internet connection as I transfer files over servers and when using Wi-Fi sometimes the connection fails just for one second but that's enough to stop the files transfer. Overall it's a good product
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Loved beginning and ending, but didn't like that the book jumped around so much. Overall, it was great if you're a hopeless romantic like myself.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Anything  this author writes holds you captive.  I like his style and the research he does is unbeleivable.  Hope to read another one soon.
B008S80PCE|2.0|I liked only one album in this set. But the price is great if you want all of Bill Withers's music.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|The beautiful colors of Planet Earth cannot be appreciated in anything other than Blu-ray. After purchasing my Blu-Ray player, this was the first collection I purchased. Couldn't be happier.
B005LAII3U|4.0|I enjoyed this movie much more than I initially expected. It deviates from the Arnold version sufficiently to provide a visual feast and engaging story but does pay homage to the original. The presentation's picture quality is excellent accompanied by a stellar audio presentation in Dolby True HD. Dialog was clear, gunshots (and there a lot of them) quite discrete and whizzed by my ears in surround glory.<br />As much as I enjoyed the Arnold version I prefer this version due to the more contemporary story and of course stellar visual effects. Arnold's version does win on the classic one liners though; Colin Farrel delivers several but they're lost in the intensity of the action scenes. Overall definitely worth at least a rental and highly recommended but awarded 4 stars as it's a remake.<br />Of note, audio playback was flawless on my setup. Several viewers of this Blu Ray have reported issues with the audio.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is really addictive. Where's th ending? There isn't one! You just keep running till you screw up but that's what is so great about this game. Cause when you fall off a cliff get devoured by monkeys or when tor fried to a crisp there are fuses wonderful little comments at the end that make &quot;little Indies funnel&quot; all better. They are just funny!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I did not want this ap as I felt I had 0 talent drawing. Boy was I wrong. This was so much fun and watching the mistakes and errors being erased was what made this ap so fun. Love playing against family.
B00628RVV0|5.0|This was such a sad movie but very well written. The innocent of children and their pure hearts. I could not believe that the mother was so clueless.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I had heard people suggest that she was a failure at adult fiction compared to the Potter books.  I disagree entirely.  Yes- this is very different, there is not the same dramatic action, in fact- there is not a huge amount of action, especially in the first half of the book.  The first half is almost entirely reaction, to the death of the main character.  She does a wonderful job with developing a number of different characters.  Many characters have a surprising response, and there is a great deal of suspense trying to figure out the interpersonal connections of the town, seeming wrapped up in small-town politics.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Loved this game and cant wait to play the sequel!  It was very challenging but not super hard to do all the tasks.  I give it five stars!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book. It is definitely a page turner. It's a story of survival, love, and hope. Now I'm off to watch the movie!
1401235417|5.0|The new 52 just keeps on churning out hit after hit and batman is no exception. The court of the owls is written so well with revelations thatll have you at the edge of your seat
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book from start to finish was so intense I couldn't put it down. Truly a great sequel and I cannot wait to start book three.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I loved the movie The Help, enjoyed it at the theaters and hope to enjoy it many more times and to share with family.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|This is a great iPhone case. Plenty of room in the cut-outs for all buttons. Fits well and isn't difficult to put on/take off. It wraps around the front of the screen a little bit to help protect it and comes with a separate screen protector.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I love the series Downton Abbey, have purchased season 1 & 2, looking forward to season 3.  Love every character in the story line.  BBC puts out great entertainment!
B0091REZMW|3.0|I've only just started playing this game and it seems pretty cool so far... I only wish the whole room was lit up every time like in the tutorial ......
B005ISQ7JM|3.0|The content was very good, but the geeky, immature writing style was very distracting. For example, he didn't need to show off by coining new words and bragging about how &#34;they should be words&#34;.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is the type of games I like. It has great graphics and it makes u wish the game would never end. It is very fun and additive. I wish this game kept going and going best game I done played
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I think you'd have to twist the arm of the younger generation to get them to read it since it's not a hack and slash movie/book, but it's worth the effort to get them to!<br /><br />One of my favorites
B0091REZMW|4.0|games good. does get slightly repetitive at times waiting to get next level but overall good. does keep trying to get me to pay money for stuff that's free
B007MDB6L0|5.0|I bought this movie for Christmas for my kids and they love it, good movie and fun to watch with them.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|The game takes you back to the days. The only set back is that you need to buy coins when you run out or wait 30 seconds to get one. It accumulates when you're offline. Don't play for ~12 hours and you'll get the max of 50 coins.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|My friend loaned me her kindle copy of this book and I couldn't put it down.  Although it's centered around high school seniors, it has a lot for adult readers as well as young adults.  It's an even mix of romance, tragedy and humor that left me in thought for days.  There's just one part in the dialogue where Holder sounds more like a psychologist than an eighteen-year-old. Otherwise the writing is great with plenty of details and character development, and I felt compelled to give five stars.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|it sharpens knives well, especially old ones made out of steel or iron but, it sharpens newer stainless still knives as well.<br />it sharpens ceramic knives very well, it sharpens saws even better. Great for any blade or edge you can fit in it. i sharpen my hadget
B007Z9QY1S|5.0|My husband and I both feel that this film is one of the best films every made.<br />A must see.
B004GYY714|5.0|I love tune in not only can you listen to your local radio you can listen to music all over the world !!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is not really free, but well worth the 2.99. Great effects &amp; storyline. I can't wait to play the sequel.
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|It was good to see some old actors return, but overall it was more of the same.... need more zombies less Wesker... Back to basics would be nice.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I want to say thanks for amazing music, really great videos and making the piano sheets available also :)<br /><br />Happy new year from Denmark
B0042X9L6A|5.0|I got a Yongnuo YN-568EX which is a great flash with HSS, but I wanted also a decent flash on my camera that can also be a Master so I can fire my YN-568EX off camera. The SB 700 works great as a commander. Easy to use dial button and menu. Put them both in iTTL and just shoot. And best part that I control the power compensation straight from the flash and don't have to pull up the camera menu as I was doing with built-in flash.
B0042FZOFU|3.0|These are great movies - our kids love them. However, several reviews claim this set has both the Blu-rays and the DVDs. We bought them excitedly thinking our kids could watch both at home on our blu-ray player and in our minivan on the DVD player. Nope! There are no DVDs included. These days, most blu-ray box sets include both, and we were disappointed these did not. So beware of the reviewers that claim this set includes both - it does not!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I've loved her from my first experience of hearing her on Britans got talent. She's a late bloomer, but hopefully unstoppable from here on out.
B004NEY9EW|1.0|The system did not tell me that it would not be compatible . . .<br /><br />Unable to view it at all, but I paid for it!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this Bible app.  It takes you from the KJV to Amplied!  At Higher Ground Interdenominational Church we read from both so this is most helpful!
B003TOH8AE|4.0|funny, action filled and overall great flick. kind of movie you can watch over and over again. Chloe kicks a$$!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I truly appreciate the ease of use this app offers. There are many options available within the app yet it still runs smoothly and it's easy to navigate. Other app writers could learn from this. Blessings!
B006LEHOL2|5.0|It's one of her best CD:s.<br />I love it!!! What a voice and lyrics.<br />You must buy it.<br />Is one of the best 2012.
B007VPLNGW|5.0|This game is getting as much use as angry birds.  It's similar to angry birds and is just as addictive
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I like this game. However, it could be even better if it allowed you to friend people just for the game. Some of the items cannot be completed unless a friend gifts them to you. My friends don't play and I don't want strangers accessing my fb page. I also think the game ends abruptly before you get the chance to click Bingo. Lastly, if you play a lot you will have to use real money as there are not enough opportunities to earn the Bingo coins needed to play. That is annoying.
B00A0SJWQU|2.0|Part Bourne, part Matrix, part Total Recall 1.<br /><br />Dull, predictable, and full of sweetener. Bad acting even for Colin Farrell. About 3/4 through the movie I got the feeling that all of this was filmed in a building the size of McDonalds. You can only take graphics so far. I'm not sure Jesus could have made it through that many close calls. And speaking of Jesus, why oh why, do writer's feel the need to break the fourth commandment every couple minutes? Is this what they call \\"edgy and daring?\\" You want edgy and daring? Try substituting the M word from another religion.
1400049628|5.0|Bought this for a friend along with a tomahawk for Christmas. Looks like an awesome book for any Zombie fan
B007T99ENE|2.0|A little boring, an author who mostly likes to show off knowledge of poetry, less of politics and nothing of MI 5
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Arrived quickly which is exactly what I needed...I use this for my Kindle and my phone.  I like that it's so long, as my phone cord is exceptionally short.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|Title pretty much says it all.  We received the DVD quick and my daughter has watched all the episodes over and over.  Wish we bought season II & III
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|These books are great except that there is still only TWO of them!!  My mistake...I thought the trilogy was complete when I started reading and now I'm in waiting mode!!!  VERY frustrating! (...but only because the story is so good!!)
141694737X|5.0|This book is really adorable and fun to read to your little one.  It is one of my favorites to read to my baby, and I highly recommend it.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|A LOT OF ACTION THAT MADE ALL OF THE OTHER BATMAN MOVIES SEEM TO AN EXTENSIONS  LEADING UP THIS EXCITING THRILLER.
0425252868|5.0|Loved this book. Amazing story, brought tears to my eyes. Really opened my eyes to the German side of the war.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book was very inspiring and held my attention from the very first page. Unlike other accounts of NDEs in which people have reported their experiences, this seemed more believable. The fact that a highly skilled professional neurosurgeon backed up his findings with scientific facts that a lay person could understand, validated his findings. It left me with a different perspective about life after death.
1451613512|1.0|I doubt if Oliver Stone penned a single word of the Untold History of the United States. He left the job to revisionist historian and anti-nuclear activist Peter Kuznick<br />The entire book is a rehash 20th Century U.S. history slanted to show what a mean bully the United States has been in relation to the rest of the world. According to the book, Russia almost single-handedly defeated the Germans in World War II. Left out was the fact, that the Russian soldiers did so with a gun at their back held by their officers. You retreat Ivan, you die.<br />Kuznick believes that if Henry Wallace had been selected to be Vice President again in 1944 instead of Truman, he would have never dropped the atomic bomb. Kuznick maintains that Truman dropped the atomic bomb on Japan because he felt insecure and wanted to show the Russians how tough he was. Truman's stated reason to drop the atomic bomb was to save American lives. That was a lie according to Kuznick. This even though Kuznick lists Richard Frank's Downfall as one of his sources in which, according to Japanese military documents, the entire Japanese nation was being prepared to fight to the death should there be an Allied invasion of Japan.<br />Stone's Untold History of the United States has in fact been told many times in less biased renderings.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great time filler when you don't want to start a book or only have a few minutes down time. Go at your own pace and let the cards fall where they may!
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|Very good book. The setting in another country is a nice change. Inspector Harry Hole is a great charactar. Lots of plot twists. A top notch who done it.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Not a very complex movie, but it was fun to watch. I think its best quality is that the lines between who is doing the right thing and who is doing the wrong thing are blurry until the very end.
B009HELT3C|1.0|Amazon picture quality horrible on this night.  Considering asking for my money back.  Movie had good story though. Would be good in true HD.
B008518MOW|5.0|WORKS AND MOVIE IS MY SON'S FAVORITE, SO i LIKE IT TOO.  3D IS QUITE GOOD AND WOULD RECOMEND TO OTHERS
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Movie was good.  Not what I expected hard to follow if you dont pay attention. overall though, a good movie.

B00701L5XS|5.0|Easy to use and can see how clearly the knots come together. Included all the basic knots my son needed to learn for Cub Scouts.
0307719774|5.0|this is sweet and simple and my brother is not a journal kind of guy but he liked this idea and it's not asking for a lot but one or two sentences and each year you can look back to see how youve changed, things you loved from years past like oh remember that great restaurant, lets go there, it's been forever.  great idea for the non journalist! I've bought 3, 2 as gifts.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent read!<br />Recommended for all who are even remotely interested in the mission to kill or capture Usama bin Ladin.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|I stumbled upon this album while searching for movie scores. I was not disappointed when sampling and quickly bought the entire album. Its inspirational listening while I write.

B00ANT9MZW|5.0|ZERO DARK THIRTY REVIEW, by Jordan B. -- 5 / 5<br /><br />\\"I'm not your friend. I'm not gonna help you. I'm going to break you. Any questions?\\"<br /><br />The ten-year manhunt for the world's most wanted terrorist leader is a story we all followed and one whose ending will likely go down in history as one of the twenty-first century's most triumphant moments, both for America and for many others across the globe. With ZERO DARK THIRTY, director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriting partner Mark Boal have taken those ten years and condensed them into 157 very deliberate, riveting, and powerful minutes. Much like the manhunt itself, ZERO DARK THIRTY is a powerhouse, a thrilling and winding tale that requires patience but arrives with an ending worth waiting for.<br /><br />September 11, 2001 was a Tuesday. ZERO DARK THIRTY begins with a bone-chilling opening sequence that brings us back to that dark day. Bigelow shows us nothing but black, and layers tens or perhaps hundreds of audio recordings of phone calls from hijacked-airplane passengers and those trapped in burning towers to their respective loved ones and to emergency operators. It is a stark, stripped sequence that is ultimately extremely affecting.<br /><br />But so, too, is the next extended sequence, one that takes place in 2003 and shows a terrorist at an unnamed detention facility relentlessly tortured by a member of the CIA, Dan (Jason Clarke), and his colleagues. Wanted is information that will hopefully lead to the capture of Osama bin Laden, but given is nothing. And so the torture continues.<br /><br />Many have condemned Bigelow and Boal for these extended torture sequences, with some critics and viewers claiming that it glorifies torture and intelligence officials stating that it incorrectly implies that these \\"enhanced interrogation techniques,\\", such as water-boarding and sleep deprivation, garnered key information that led to bin Laden's capture.<br /><br />I will briefly take an aside and add my two cents with this: 1) I don't agree that the film takes the stance that torture is \\"good\\" or permissible, and 2) I don't agree that the film implies that the torture of CIA detainees directly led to the capture of Osama bin Laden. But I digress.<br /><br />The rest of the film follows newcomer CIA agent Maya (Jessica Chastain) and her colleagues as they sift through years of intelligence data, with more coming in than they can handle and most of it a paper trail leading to dead ends. That is, until Maya follows a lead that, with her undying confidence and ruthless conviction, garners a name to follow and eventually a location to scope out: the Abbottabad, Pakistan compound that housed Osama bin Laden and his all-important courier.<br /><br />ZERO DARK THIRTY closes with a thrilling raid that will surely keep you on the edge of your seat, or bobbing your knee up and down, or biting your nails, or whatever your nervous tick may be. Bigelow creates tension that is palpable, even though we already know the outcome.<br /><br />Much like David Fincher's 2007 crime-thriller ZODIAC, ZERO DARK THIRTY is a cold, calculated procedural of whose beginning and ending we are fully aware but whose events in-between we might not be. ZERO DARK THIRTY sheds light on these in-between events via first-hand accounts of the manhunt for bin Laden, dramatized to ensure full effect on-screen. Though obviously condensed, the film is certainly compelling, and unfolds swiftly and with ease.<br /><br />The success of ZERO DARK THIRTY as a motion picture rests on the shoulders of two very capable women: Academy Award winning director Kathryn Bigelow and Academy Award nominated star Jessica Chastain.<br /><br />Bigelow's execution here is nothing short of masterful. The film is 157 minutes long but plays like a 100-minute thriller due to Bigelow's ability to pack as much punch in each moment as humanly possible. And yet, with all this information to present, she never forgets that there is a veryreal human element behind all that intelligence.<br /><br />Enter Chastain as Maya, a tough-as-nails woman who takes on the ball-breaking task of finding bin Laden with fierce tenacity and exciting verve. Chastain, in a word, is exceptional. She plays the role close to the chest, wearing Maya's emotions on her sleeve and crafting a performance that never feels forced. It simply feels real, as though Chastain is her true-life CIA counterpart. And there is no better acting than acting that feels real.<br /><br />ZERO DARK THIRTY is perhaps 2012′s most vital film, not because of the politics people try to pull from it but because of the story it tells, or rather, the story Bigelow and Boal allow to tell itself. This is a satisfying procedural at its finest, a gripping, compelling, dramatic thriller that begs to be seen and discussed. It's a story our nation remembers, and one we will never forget.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This game is the best since cut the rope experiments!<br />Gameplay: You are a red pudding (looks like jello) and have to connect with other puddings. You have to land ON the stars, so getting all 3 might sometimes be difficult. Challenging enough to keep playing.<br />It's a great game! Try out the free version first. The ads are pretty easy to ignore. Fun when you are bored!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|We bought this for our boys (and us) for Christmas. We always enjoyed the book and was curious how they would adapt this for the big screen. We were not disappointed. Danny Devito did an awesome job as the Lorax. We have seen this multiple times since Christmas.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Well written historical novel that explores the politics both behind World War I and the communist revolution in czarist Russia.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My daughter loves this game and I do because you don't have to buy every little thing. It has plenty to keep someone busy and engaged.
B0091REZMW|2.0|It's okay. Needs to be more than three items to search for. But it is free so I can't complain
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was a booked that my 8th grade daughter noted was banned at some schools.  She read the book first, then saw the movie.  She appreciated the challenges of growing up that the book presented.  Kudos to Mr. Chbosky!
B00004NRWH|3.0|I'm a long time fan of NB and find this album and State/Curb to be both pretty good. IMO not as great as their later albums, but still worth it for fans.
B008G8SFGO|3.0|Christmas gift for my KISS fan hubby. He listened to it, but not all the way thru. It's just okay he says
B000FTWB7G|5.0|pretty good album of theirs, I'd say it's well worth the money to buy this album even if it's just for a few of the songs.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|I was hooked after the first chapter! Couldn't put it down. Can't wait to download and read the rest of the house of night series!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I was hesitant in buying this because it was Nicholas sparks and I know he is known for sappy books I usually can't connect with but this was totally different. The first couple chapters seemed to be boring but once I got hooked on Katies character, I stayed up all night reading until I learned of her past. The end had a haunting twist and I'm so happy I read it. Definitely recommend!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game! Very addicting! Ive had the game for quite a while and it never gets old! Play never ends!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app is awesome! Beats my $100.00 sound machine. I love to use this at bedtime to help fall asleep. Also it is just relaxing to have in the backround when doing other things as well. The company is great and the support is excellent. Thank you!
B00006HAZG|5.0|This is a two-part BBC version of a Dickens' novel of the same name. David was born three months after the death of his father, of the same name. Great-Aunt Betsey Trotwood arrived at the home anticipating a girl, is horrified that it's a boy, and immediately leaves. David grows up loved and cared for by his mother and their maid. However, when David is eight his mother marries a stern man who dislikes David and quickly dominates the household. When the stepfather canes David for being unable to answer difficult homework question, David bites him severely and is sent to an abusive boarding school.<br /><br />David's mother dies and David is then sent to work in a London black ink factory while living with one of the stepfather's friend. This man treats David like his own son but ends up in a debtor's prison and can no longer house David. David runs away to Dover in the hope that Betsey Trotwood will take him in. Surprisingly, she does and is very supportive to David. He completes his schooling while staying with a friend of Betsey's (Mr. Wickfield), and then is apprenticed to a lawyer as a clerk.<br /><br />Eventually David marries Dora, the lawyer's daughter, who turns out to be an 'airhead.' David then realizes he's loved Agnes Wickfield all along, and they marry. The movie ends with the birth of their third child - a girl. Betsey Trotwood's wish had finally come true, and David pursues his writing career with increasing success.
B0063IH60K|5.0|When I first got this game, I started to get the hang of it, so I thought this was my favorite game. THIS GAME IS SO FUN!!!!!

B00454U1NS|5.0|It came on time and was new like the it was advertise to be I love Pink.<br />  M L McKenzie
B005F9TPZ2|5.0|I absolutely love this album. I first bought it upon its release years ago, but somehow while the case/cover still exists, the cd mysteriously vanished a few years ago.  So I decided it was time I purchase a replacement so I could once again enjoy the magical sounds created by the wonderfully talented Fiona....<br />I recommend that anyone who loves beautiful, passionate music, go buy this album NOW!!!!
B0090EHVMC|5.0|This is a great movie for any age. A great lesson and very fun. I love it and so does my 3 year old!
B008JGSM6G|3.0|game is good. played til 6x6 grid.only issue was levels were not  so difficult. May be higher size levels are more difficult. Altogether a decent app to have
B000002P74|5.0|Awesome. My Husband is driving me crazy. This is an awesome band. I wish they were still around. I love southern rock.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|God is amazing when you look at Eben's reading list; everyone on that list has a different experience with what they received. None of us has the ability to understand God, all any of us can do is share what He has shown us and He has shown many different directions to many different people. There is a single fact that can be surmised on, and that fact is this life, our human experience is a training ground with a test bench built in.<br />In 1995 me God showed me the abyss and said He was about ready to foreclose if mankind did not begin standing against injustices! 2009 He told me only 7% of the entire world was \\"worthy\\" of salvation, I have come to understand that many will spend time paying \\"every last penny:\\" this I am sure will allow many to add their names to the saved list. Nearly every religion in the world has the very same basic foundation, love your neighbor and take care of him when needed. There are two things I can point out that I have learned; God hates liars and hypocrites.<br />Eben's encounter with God only showed the overwhelming love God has for us, it never touched on the fact Jesus warned us that every kingdom of this world belongs to Lucifer! I truly understand that Eben has spent his life trying to help his fellow man with his work. There are so many out there who control their lives by personal gain, what is in it for me! I would list the names of my books but Amazon refused to post my last review where I added my book to it. All I can say; make sure what you do is not for self or personal enhancement, personal gratifying  ideas are on a worldly plane and do you more harm than good.
B000EHSVS2|5.0|One of my husbands favorites. My Dad watched war films . I'm not into this. But if you love war flicks then this is one for you.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Harrison ford is one of the best actors in our time and indiana jones was made for him. Great movies
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|It's been a long wait to have Rebus back with us - an outstanding read and good to see him operate on wider stage
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Excellent story loved it from beginning to end. Well written, tremendous effort used to develop these complicated characters and wonderfully imaginative plots. Truly enjoyed it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It is a bit racy but had a good story line.  It was hard to put the books down.  It was interesting to see how Grey evolved.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I really enjoy this game a lot but the prices for everything are through the roof!!! I mean SERIOUSLY people!!!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I loved all the walking dead. Not many shows can keep me interested, but the walking dead sure can! Cant wait until season 4!!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great series! Movies will not be able to do it justice. But fantastic to the end. Very highly recommend it to anyone.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|This game was great. Sometimes it hot a little repetitive, but it was fun. I saw that some people gave this app one star because it had `stuff inappropriate for people under the age on 16`. It had the word sex! I'm 11 and I contacted! When I was 9 I didn't care! So, if you're afraid of the word sex, then there's this thing called PARENTAL LOCK! This app is great, so ignore all of the one star ratings that day it's inappropriate.
B009H7SCMA|5.0|About a young lady of the upper class who wants to win the game of cricket for her school.  She ends up falling head over heals in love with a member of the opposite team who is from the lower class.  It is an erotic story line with allot of humor.  It is well worth the read!
B006ZE66P8|5.0|I love this book and I saw this on a movie before and I think this IS THE BEST book!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Definitely a page turner. Never really predictable. I would definitely recommend this book to any person willing to read it. Within its pages, great entertainment awaits.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I thought the first book was good, but this one took me entirely by surprise. I cannot wait to get started on the third.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|It was worth reading if you like this kind of story. The pictures were a nice touch and helped the story.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I that another book would be pretty much impossible, and the ending was great and all, but I'm depressed that it just ENDED. Other than that it was kinda morbid.
B00A4CHZ2K|5.0|I was  merrily anticipating buying this album and I do not regret it one bit. I admire Phillip Phillips and his sound. Can't wait to get the next one.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Its so fun and I love it and who dose not like the tv show its a good app so if you want a really fun app get this game sincerely Adriana Estrella
B004RJMUJO|5.0|this game is very fun and addictive.  kids and adults will play it for hours and hours, good for the whole family.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Just finished this amazing book it has twist and turns in it truly the best one yet! if you're a Percy Jackson fan then you WILL absolutely love this series!
B003O86FMW|4.0|This is just good reading I haven't stopped since Xmas. Your just submerged in action and emotions things that you never thought of before
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Best book i have read  thus far. It impacted me in ways beyond belief. I now look at the world differently due to our desr john green
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a very good book. I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read more of Nicholas sparks books.
0446554995|1.0|A fan of both authors ( until recently) and especially the character Agent Pendergast I was excited to read this book.  Half of it I skimmed through, which you'll note is a few hundred pages...  The entire 'secret'  Bavarian/Nazi recreated town in Brazil with it's 'secret' genetic experiments......boring. And old.  Hasn't this theme been told a few times during the past 60 years??? The all encompassing almost debilitating love Pendergast has for wife Helen - and she never once, even knowing all his skills and intellectual acuity, never tells him about her birth, her twin - and never mentions she gave birth to his children??????  Maybe Pendergast sunk so low and wanted to kill himself not out of love but for being such an idiot?  Perhaps he couldn't cope that someone pulled off that level of subterfuge on him?  I skimmed through the Brazil Nazi town section, but I did find the Tristams invocation to 'love one another' at the height of an armed conflict to be very banal and most unbelievable.  I do realize it's a story and am prepared to suspend certain realities, but come on - I felt like I was reading a child's book with a moral theme gussied up for adults.  Other reviewers have made comments I completely agree with, such as Pendergasts superhuman strength, shooting accurately from an unstable racing motorcycle...on and on.... And we finally find out the truth about Constance...uh huh.  And what?  What's with the goofy old broad who has her servant bury people in the cellar?  really?  I wouldn't buy another book by these two, which is a shame for me as I enjoyed the previous ones, so I'll be missing out.  My opinion: if you're still interested in the authors after this book - try the library first.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a good book in every way. As a teenage girl Katniss really stood her ground and held up strong for a lot of peculiar people that need to learn to do the same as Katniss. Though there was a killer movie to go with the book, the book totally overlapped the movie. The only thing I needed the movie for is to see the place describing American as Panam (if that's right). Once I seen the movie my picture that I created was totally wrong, so I am still willing to accept the movie. Ms. Collins well done on the imagination you have gave us, and your open mind shall lead you far in this creative world.<br /><br />-15 year old
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Wonderfully written. How to take a potentially dry and boring subject and make it into a intriguing story that you can't put down. I am a runner who recently switched to a natural way of running which alleviated all the pains I was having form running. But you don't have to be a runner to enjoy this book. The story is so well written, non runners and non athletes will enjoy it just as well.<br />Give it a read and you will be pleasantly surprised.
B0043EV774|5.0|Excellent in 3d, love the colors , love the acting<br /><br />Best fantasy movie<br /><br />Blu ray a must<br /><br />So funny too
B0026WNGBA|5.0|I was a road runner(power runner) for 10 yrs from 20-30yo and finally had to give it up from knee,hip & back pain and switched to cycling & swimming. For the next 25 years every 5 yrsor so, I would try to run again on road and off road and within a few weeks all the pains would reappear, so I would stop. Recently I made another attempt to run off-road and again the pains came back. I did some research about barefoot running and came across this book not that it is about barefoot running, but it uses the running style necessary for barefoot running. After reading this book and applying the Chi technique to my running using minimalist shoes on trails, my pains went away and have not reoccurred. After only a month, I just did 13 miles yesterday and feel great today. Finally thanks to Danny Dreyer and this book I'm able to enjoy running again. The book is a great read with well thought out instructions as to how to approach and learn how to run using your Chi.
B004YOEFG8|5.0|Amazing , the most incredible images I have ever seen<br /><br />How do they do it<br />The Hubble is the best
B0094LY88G|5.0|Loved it. Not a big Pitt fan but do love baseball and a good story. Fine acting by all and gripping tale
B004APVI1G|5.0|Feathers of love<br /><br />Amazing movie<br /><br />So much love<br />So much beauty<br />You can fly with the owls<br />How wonderful<br />One of the best movies for animal lovers
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I love Tina Fey and I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is always refreshing to read comedic writing that is written in someone's voice  so clearly. All the stories were entertaining and I felt like I got to know much more about Ms. Fey and her life. Couldn't put the book down!! Loved it!!
B0027BVMSY|4.0|I found this episode better than its prequel. Bond was still more &#34;dark&#34; than I'd like, but he was more Bond-like. I understand the classic Bond is actually back in the next episode starring Daniel Craig.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Really for young adults not this old mother of teenagers. Had to suspend reality when it came to high school life.
B004RKXNDU|5.0|Many who are/were &#34;in the business&#34; have stated that it is. I know as a lay reader that it's the most fascinating spy story I've ever experienced, and the most superbly written.<br /><br />Note: for a supplemental treat, see the BBC 6-part television adaptation produced in the 1970's starring Alec Guinness and an extraordinary supporting cast.  LeCarre considered this to be as perfect an adaptation of any of his works as he could imagine, and he dedicated the final book in his &#34;Karla&#34; trilogy to Guinness in tribute.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I like the game but do not like that you have to buy tips and that you cant earn points by playing
0375869026|5.0|This book is a must read for everyone...<br />\\"Everyone in the world should get a standing ovation at least once in their life...\\"
B006LSZECO|3.0|The novel is a decent mystery with some unusual twist turns and ending. The conclusion was surprising as well as unexpected.
B005723JSQ|4.0|I think Sophie Kinsella has done it again. Although this is supposed to be a chick lit, it is not your regular run of the mill book. This book is very well written. I could not put it down quickly. The author has paced the book very well and she managed to maintain humour until the very end. I really needed a good laugh after a few very serious reads and this book provided that much needed relief. I loved the story line, although not very plausible, it was still original and hilarious. In the digital age, the author has used a theme with texting, emails and mobiles and she has used it all to perfection. I could read this book again!<br />I thought the footnotes were really unique and were witty but then too much of a good thing becomes an overkill. The footnotes began to get in the way of my reading. I would have loved to have some footnotes through the book but I felt the existing ones were just too many to handle.I read the kindle edition and didn't like the fact that I had to click on the link to go read the footnote and then click back to get back to where I was reading. I definitely prefer a pop up, which could have popped up when clicked and could have been closed after reading.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|The entire series in one high definition collection. It played very well on our 55&#34; LED LCD display. The sound was awesome as well. It was a great gift. It was like watching live action through a window.
B008AUGEFC|5.0|I wish I could give this 4.5 stars, but alas - an explanation will have to suffice.  This book is not for those with a short attention span.  The beginning is tedious, confusing at times, and takes quite a while to get going.  But trust me, stay with it.  This is a manifesto whose beauty is only surpassed by its complexity.  The story could not be adequately told in any other way, spanning any less of history, and this will become clear only after you pass the halfway mark.  Be patient with it and I promise you it will unfold before your eyes into something quite wondrous.<br /><br />And don't distract yourself with the movie - the substantive differences in the vignettes and overall plot are enough to change the meaning of the story, and much for the worse I might add.  The movie largely misses the point in its quest to engage the audience in a contrived love story that is almost non-existent in the original with an ending tied up with a pretty bow.  Disappointing, but with a novel this complex, not surprising.  Mitchell's original vision is where the real magic is.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|I purchased this product to upload books from my old Kindle (a D00111 Model) to my computer.  Unfortunately, this USB does not fit the old models.  It may work beautifully on the newer models, but for mine it's a bust!  There is another (and much more expensive) cable available for the older models from one of Amazon's retailers -- not Amazon itself.  A bother -- and of course, you also need to return this cable if you make this mistake.
B005CKPQ7A|5.0|Wife and I watched pilot episode and wanted more so I ordered Netflix to watch season's 1-3. Season 5 was coming up so I ordered Season 4 thru Netflix... Glad I did...we watched 3 & 4 episodes each night to catch up before season 5...!
1455527475|4.0|I enjoyed \\"Why I Left Goldman Sachs\\" and the insights into the culture it provided.  Although there have been some criticisms of the accuracy of some of what Smith writes, nothing I have seen gives me the impression that the portrait he paints of Goldman Sachs is fundamentally inaccurate.  Moreover, what he identifies as problems are obvious once you think about it: the inherent conflict of interest in proprietary trading, and that the whole point of a complex derivative is to sell something to someone who doesn't understand what they are getting.  The principal value of this book is that it brings these points to a broader audience.<br /><br />A third problem that was hinted at in the book, but not built upon further, was the degree to which the shifts in investment banking culture were tied to the transition of investment banks from traditional partnerships to publicly traded corporations with some aspect of partnership remaining.  I would be interested in hearing more on this theme by people on the inside.<br /><br />Much of the book is autobiographical along the lines of Scott Turow's \\"One L\\".  I liked this aspect well enough, but it is not why people come to read the book.  Smith's assessment of his own abilities is uniformly very high, and there is very little sense of Smith overcoming any real challenges for himself -- we are given a sense of how hard the things were that Smith accomplished easily, but not any internal struggle on Smith's part.  That being said, the biographical content is enjoyable and gives context to his discontents.
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|I love this movie.<br />My first movie I've watched on Amazon and I am planning to watch more soon!<br />Watched it on full screen (1920x1080) with great quality and NO pausing between to wait for it to load.<br /><br />Thanks, Amazon!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|You'd think building a Kindle e-book was like learning Greek the way people talk about it. I was really scared about it. And then, I saw this free e-book on Amazon. It contains all the basics in an easy-to-understand, step-by-step approach and answered all my questions. I'm sure there are lots of fancy additions you can do, but this book will get you a basic, clean, professional e-book if you follow their guidance. If you are proficient with Microsoft Word (e.g., styles), then you will definitely find this process manageable.<br /><br />Before you spend money on an e-book on this topic or pay someone to format your book, please check out this book. It's written by the Kindle folks, so they definitely know what works.
B006KP3XCQ|4.0|I've always wanted this movie.<br />The packaging it came in, however, was more of a cardboard foldable flimsy sleeve.. so upon opening the package I saw the edges had been bent and out of shape which was probably damaged during delivery.<br />The movie was in mint perfect condition though. So I was still all smiles.<br /><br />The message I got from this movie:<br />- Let's take care of our planet.<br />- Old can be just as good as new.<br />- Love comes in different shapes and forms.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|I purchased this new, wrapped series collection expecting it to be in good condition since it is unused. For some reason the visual quality of the DVDs is awful, I can barely see the details and faces. I am returning it because it's so bad it's not worth watching.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like that I can select a winning or random hand.  Sometimes I just want to win!  I also like that it asks if you want to auto-complete or not.  Sometimes it's more satisfying to do it myself.

B009X01GJ2|5.0|I love this product. Works as described. Love the color. Would highly recommend. Really researched products and like that this rotates in both landscape and portrait for various viewing angles.
B00992CF6W|2.0|It's not as good as the real version because you scant go on real<br /><br />servers and when it's night there are no monsters
B006MW3V6U|5.0|As far as costume dramas go, this is the best I've seen in a long time. Can't wait for season 3.
0071752854|4.0|Very insightful as it relates to today's buyers and marketplace. All of my sales work is done over the phone so it doesn't come at it from that angle as much.  Would highly recommend this book to any one selling investments and high ticket products or services face to face.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan Boyle just amazes me!  I love to see the reaction on the judges when she first step on stage at Britain Got Talent and then blew them away when she opened her mouth and sang.  I am planning on getting more of her albums in the future.  I'm glad she took the step and came forward.  What a blessing.  I give her a standing ovation as well!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|One of the best series I have ever watched! Great location, costumes, actors, plot and direction.<br />Can't wait for Season 3.

0783225725|5.0|\\"High Plains Drifter\\" is fiction based on fact.  Like many American cities and regions, especially past but even present, Lago was run by a corrupt cabal of backstabbing businessmen.  And also like many other places in America, Lago's backroom business buddies hired others to do their dirty work.<br /><br />In `High Plains Drifter' Eastwood reprises his \\"man with no name\\" as an avenging \\"man who may or may not have a name\\".  Lago's previous sheriff was murdered by hoodlums hired by Lago's gang of business crooks.  Eastwood's \\"stranger\\" rides into town to avenge his death, and may or may not, in fact, be the sheriff.  Regardless, the stranger exacts a fistful of just retribution, including raising the lowest of Lago to the ultimate pinnacle of power, and lowering the high and mighty of Lago to the depths of just desserts.  He also gives them more \\"eye for an eye\\" by allowing the same toughs who killed the sheriff (or himself) to kill the culpable townsfolk.  After giving the paid killers their own individualized dose of final justice, the Stranger rides off into the sunset, just as it should be.  Amen.<br /><br />This is the best of the old Eastwood westerns, and may be the best of ALL westerns due in no small part to its implied commentary on America's \\"anti-democracy\\": the unelected influence and/or actual rule by backroom business good `ol boys.
B002ZG999U|5.0|I also have this movie if was very difficult to find locally. Entertaining seeing these old action stars in a movie together.
B005MMYBXI|5.0|I thought the missing Spartacus character would be the pink elephant in the room for this whole series,but I didn't even miss him! Gannicus is such a interesting character that this story should have lasted much longer than six measly episodes! It has a wonderful back story that shedded so much light on how the characters we love to hate actually got that way. If you loved &#34;blood and Sand&#34; you will not be disappointed with &#34;Gods of the Arena&#34;!
B001VNB54A|5.0|I did not watch the movie yet but plan on borrowing as we bought it as a gift for my nephew who had band of brothers and now wanted this set.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I really liked the deal I got with the movie, getting the Blu-ray/DVD combo pack. I got it pretty quickly. I would definitely recommend getting it.

1451626657|5.0|Heller's satiric tone is a refreshing break from most classical literature. He manages to write about a very serious and somber topic and make the reader laugh without making light of the subject. The book actually does have something funny on every page. This is one of those books that you simply must read if you do any kind of reading at all.
0007455992|5.0|great addition to an awesome series. it is a very long read but well worth it. if you like the series its a must have

B005KJJ4F8|5.0|You think you know the story, but it's way better than any fairytale. The author combines a dystopian world with a familiar childhood story, making it a simply incredible book.

B007KZY1YY|4.0|If you need a spark in your sex life...try reading this. The book has a story line that is ok and even if you don't like the SM ideas, it pushes your mind a gear up with regard to forplay--physical and verbal. The idea of less is more and innuendo are definitely worth a try--who knows they might even raise libido rates in YOUR bed.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Honestly I don't get it but my 10 year old loves this game. He can play for hours just building a house or growing his garden.
B007KOYEOC|3.0|A bit predictable, but still good descriptional passages of Mr. Grey's techniques. His transition from Dom to fairly regular normally functioning guy seems a bit too easy and not quite believable. I am tempted to say...&#34;and they lived happily ever after...

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I don't usually read much, but I had heard so much about this amazing trilogy, and so far have not been able to put them down. I can't wait to start number 3. I do hope the author decides to put out a number 4
B001PJRAUS|5.0|This production, although rooted in a fantasy of the original, was clearly written and performed by people who love Pride & Prejudice. The care and attention that was given to this Alternate Universe adaptation was no less enjoyable than the 1995 BBC production. It's also clear that the 1995 BBC production influenced this one as well.<br /><br />If you buy or rent or download, just take the time to see this. It really is great.

B003TSEL7S|5.0|I loved Percy Jackson and the lightning thief and when I started this book of blew me away! I love how Leo is so sarcastic and funny and I love how there is love unknown between Jackson and Piper. I loved how detailed the book is, from the setting, to the vicious enemies! This was a thrilling book and I can't wait to read the rest of the series! :) I meant Jason..<br /><br /> Sorry!
0525952926|5.0|Well researched, fast-paced interesting book. Loved how the chapters are split up to focus on one set of characters and that the view from each country is shared. If you liked the 1st book in this trilogy, the second won't disappoint!
B002OSY2T6|5.0|This toy is adorable!  Make sure you turn it off before you go to bed at night b/c the smallest noise or movement will set it to singing/laughing.<br /><br />My 5 month old sits independently and adores this toy.  She crows and kicks when I bring it out.  It rolls smoothly so she feels a sense of accomplishment.<br /><br />The noises it makes are cute without being obnoxious and you have two choices of volume.<br /><br />It's just a super sweet, basic baby toy but worth every penny.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book has a futuristic plot that grips you and keeps you from putting it down. The story is intricate, believable, and the author develops the characters so well you feel as if you know them. I love this book.
B009IJJB8G|4.0|Excellent video quality, streams very well, through my Roku XDS.  However, for some apparent reason I have to switch my settings on the Roku to Stereo instead of 5.1 surround sound, which takes away from the Blu-ray experience.  I would also like the ability to purchase the whole season at a discounted price, kind of expensive, paying 2.99 for each 50 minute episode.  However, the removal of the commercials is an added bonus, but I can DVR this show and fast forward through the commercials and not pay a fortune episode.  I hope the audio problem and the pricing gets resolved!  Thanks!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven is a phenomenal story of a woman who learns to trust and love again against all odds. It is a beautiful story of the power of love.

B002GHIPYI|4.0|These headphones are one of the best ones out there for your money on a tight budget. They sound crisp and I can hear much more detail than with bassy beats. The sound is mostly even with a very slight emphasis on bass. The bass goes pretty deep and the highs aren't super shrill like everyone kept saying. The one big turn off for me was the lack of comfort from the pads. The pads get sweaty pretty quickly and my head feels somewhat clamped in from such a seal. Definitely get replacement headphone pads unless you can deal with taking a break every 30 minutes. These also don't isolate too well. People near me can hear my music fairly audibly.

They probably sound the same, but I just am having a hard time finding any Metal that I like anymore.  Black Label Society is my favorite &#34;new&#34; band, that's sad.  I just don't like the sounds of today or the monotony of old bands putting out the same sound.  Metallica's Death Magnetic was a pleasant surprise, but it was because they went back in time to more of what made them popular.

B000I0QL82|5.0|One reason that we got the DVD is that it is much closer to the original than the current broadcast version. In particular, it contains the Abraham black-face sketch. The song Abraham is not one of the better-known songs from &#34;Holiday Inn&#34;, but I think that the sketch should not be cut and should be judged in light of the standards of the day. I admit that I might feel different if I were Black. However, without the performance a significant plot point is lost that may make a person watching the movie for the story get whiplash trying to figure out Bing got her to put on blackface and then there is an entirely different conversation. Altogether it is a wonderful movie with great songs, great singing and great dancing.

B008966SIU|5.0|Grizzly Bear has evolved throughout their relatively long history.  While I generally prefer their earlier album, Veckatimest, this is their most accessible album to date.  &#34;Speak in Rounds&#34; and &#34;Yet Again&#34; are the clear singles and sound slightly over produced.  The album as a whole is airy, musically complex, and slightly more pop-ish than previous albums.  If you like Folk or Indie rock in the veins of the XX and Arcade Fire, this album is for you.
0545265355|5.0|I never thought I would read --let alone enjoy so much-- \\"the Hunger Games\\" trilogy.  I think that the field of \\"young adult literature\\" has changed profoundly since I was in that demographic category.<br /><br />\\"The Hunger Games\\" is nothing like the young adult fiction of my youth.  Books like \\"the Hardy Boys,\\" \\"Three Investigators,\\" \\"the Outsiders,\\" and \\"the Wizard of Oz\\" all were good reads but they certainly presented a sanitized view of human nature and the human condition...cruelty, violence, horror simply don't exist in them.<br /><br />This is not the case in the world built in \\"the Hunger Games.\\"  The fictional nation of Panem to me combines the  excesses of the Roman Empire with the Orwellian cruelty of modern day North Korea.  In that world, there is  hatred, despair, atrocity, war, and senseless violence.  But there is also selflessness, heroism, self-sacrifice, and loyalty as embodied by the story's narrator, Katniss Everdeen.<br /><br />Katniss is an enormously sympathetic character and keen observer of the world around her.  And even though she's a fictional creation living in a fictional world, I found her to be \\"real\\" far more than many characters in fiction that approaches real life.  And I think it's a measure of how good an author Suzanne Collins is that when I finished reading the last book, I found myself sad that there was nothing more to read about her...but also glad because the character had suffered and lost so much, she deserved some peace in the end.<br /><br />As far as the individual books go, I would rate them as equally good.  Highlights of the first include the 74th Hunger Games and Katniss's experiences in the Capitol before them.  Highlights of the second are when the \\"Quarter Quell\\" takes place and we are introduced to an array of the past victors of the Hunger Games.  And the best parts of the final volume are the ones that talk about how Katniss became a propaganda weapon in the hands of the rebellion sparked by her actions in the arena.<br /><br />So to sum up, this is a wonderful trilogy.  I'd only caution parents that it is not something I'd let kids younger than their early teens read because it is ultimately such an \\"adult\\" story.the arena.<br /><br />So to sum up, this is a wonderful trilogy.

B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|Sit down, buckle up and hang on for a wild and sometimes confusing ride.  This movie delivered on every level for me.  Hot, sexy and raw with more than a little action.  Well acted, well shot and well put together.<br /><br />This is long movie, but its worth it.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Well crafted visually with a lot of detail and high quality cinematography.  The story?  Fun, not oscar material with a so-so ending, but worth the time of viewing.  A lot of choreographed fight scenes.<br />The city-scapes brought to mind the Sci-fi classic &#34;Blade Runner&#34;.
B00AEFVRB2|1.0|There is nothing positive you can say about this movie.  It is poorly written, poorly directed and poorly acted.  The story never really develops, you never really care about the characters and the ending is completely unsatisfying.<br /><br />Please save both your time and your money!
B0055S348W|5.0|Works perfectly. Found wireless printer immediately. Easy to use. Worth the cost. Plan to but and install on other kindles that my kids have
030758836X|5.0|This book was great! It had such a unique twist that I was totally surprised.  Gillian Flynn is a wonderful writer.
0547884591|5.0|I just started reading the book.<br />But just the presentantion is very nice, the cover, the photos are very vivid and cool.<br />About the content, it has more stuff then I thougth, so until now, it's above my expectations.
B007SGM084|5.0|To be very honest, I felt these books were not written well but I still gave it 5 stars.  I loved the story line.  Loved the characters.  In some ways I live w/a Christian Grey.  If you look deeper into the story it's not about the S&M.  It's about a man battling PTSD because he was abused as a child.  How he coped and conquered his demons.
B003K16P3M|5.0|I really love this book and I highly recommend it! I am definitely going to read the next two books.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I usually never read all the books at once in a series.  But the Hunger Games caught my attention quickly and kept me interested non stop for all three.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was absolutely the best book ever read so far by me I am so excited to read the third book
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Read all the books in a row.  Couldn't put the trilogy down until the very end.  I was a little disappoint in the ending but it was a personal thing since I live w/a person that has PTSD.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Must see, fun movie. Singing is outstanding. Don't let this one go unseen.  Unlike a typical boring music based movie. Try it and you will certainly be entertained.
0345803485|1.0|the book was in bad shape and not in order. person i gave it too didn't tell me before I answered amazons followup
B008WCP2PG|1.0|Poor movie, not worth the money and I am I big fan of the star of the show, but a very disappointing movie, not worth $5.00 in my view, maybe $1 at Redbox if there is absolutely nothing else to watch. Really a surprising letdown.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I've have a hard time putting this one down, even at one o'clock in the morning.  I can't wait for Flynn's next one.
B007N8RULO|4.0|I have become addicted to this game. App works fine and I really don't think the ads are that big of a deal. I find the 2 suit option too hard, so I can't imagine the 4 suit, but I'm sure as I waste more time playing, I'll get it.
B000TYWAUA|4.0|I really Liked this Movie.<br />I like the fact that they don't ever give up.<br />This movie is very well done.
1451620829|3.0|KISS always liked to rant about how \\"Rock 'n' Roll All Nite\\" was the band's signature anthem and encompassed everything anyone needed to know about who they are. It's the typical slice of B.S. served by this marketing dynamo since the early days. A more apt song would be \\"Psycho Circus\\" ... as in these are four psychotic men with severe mental and personality disorders reduced to slapping the clown make-up on to feed whatever sick desires that are needed to keep the sociopaths satisfied.<br /><br />KISS, the band and not the corporation, indeed did exist at one point. The early years were full of tales of a group of young men (extending beyond the four to people like Bill Aucoin and Sean Delaney) attempting to bring rock 'n' roll into a modern era with choreography, explosions, lights and an intense focus on the image. The music was good enough to provide a framework and luckily for the group there was enough luck to go around to advance them into a place where childish fantasies could be indulged in for decades.<br /><br />What surprised me is Peter's admission that KISS stopped functioning as a collaborative creative effort as early as 1976. Gene and Paul were content on the band being a business venture. Friendships and song-writing partnerships disappeared. It was four guys doing their own thing and it would amazingly remain that way for another 35 years.<br /><br />Peter sadly could never bring himself to break free of the baggage of his initial escape from KISS. He bought into the delusion that he was more popular than he really was and continues to have high hopes for solo recording efforts to this day. Despite Ace's heavy drug and booze addiction, the guy at least hit the clubs and got back to work building his own identity outside of KISS. Criss thinks he's somehow entitled to playing Madison Square Garden for the rest of his life and had extreme trouble adapting to becoming a different kind of professional rock drummer.<br /><br />Criss's bickering over money on the reunion tour is amusing. If it didn't happen, he would have blown his head off at some point in the '90s. There was no possible income for this man. Gene and Paul did treat him unfairly as far as his pay from the final tours were concerned, but he chose disastrous representation and negotiated terrible deals for himself.<br /><br />This book is probably a last gasp effort to turn his KISS fame into some sort of money. He certainly does make it work the price of admission (as KISS did with its shows in its hey-day), but we're left with a disturbing portrait of people who should have never received the attention that they did.

0062068415|5.0|Faced with a dearth of newly published books I really wanted to read (the mere thought of wading through yet another of James Patterson's churned-out-in-a-hurry books of the month made my stomach churn), I started looking at other options. When a couple of friends on Goodreads.com gave great ratings to books by Dennis LeHane, it reminded me how much I'd loved his \\"Mystic River\\" - a \\"New York Times\\" bestseller that was turned into an equally terrific motion picture starring Sean Penn.<br /><br />But for whatever reason, I've never picked up any of his other books. He's written several; but the one I chose now is the one that got the highest marks at Goodreads: \\"Shutter Island\\". And I'll tell you up front, it blew me away.<br /><br />Shutter Island is the site of a hospital from the criminally insane, and Teddy Daniels, a U.S. Marshal, is sent there in 1954 to find a female killer who's escaped. Not wanting him to go to the potentially dangerous place by himself, the powers-that-be who gave him the assignment also gave him a partner named Chuck, whom Teddy almost immediately comes to trust even though they've never met before.<br /><br />Soon, it's revealed that there may be another reason for Teddy's visit: The hospital doctors and prison warden may be using the inmates for drug experimentation, surgical trials and other unethical practices that need to be exposed and stopped. Then too, Teddy just may have accepted the assignment for a much more personal reason that involves the death of the wife he loved more than life itself.<br /><br />As Teddy and his partner Chuck quickly learn, nothing on the island is what it seems. A patient manages to escape from a locked room that's constantly monitored by orderlies, guards and medical staff, leaving behind what appears to be a coded message. Records of another patient believed to be committed a year ago have gone missing - but perhaps he was never really there. And what goes on in the former lighthouse that's surrounded by barbed wire and inaccessible? The medical personnel aren't forthcoming - and then a hurricane hits and Chuck goes missing, leaving Teddy alone, [literally] in the dark and increasingly certain that he may never get off the island.<br /><br />More details I can't offer without giving away too much, but I will warn that this book is almost guaranteed to mess with your head, and from at least the halfway point you won't want to put it down. The ending is a real shocker (although in retrospect I suppose I should have seen it coming). Still, I re-read the last four pages three times because I simply couldn't wrap my head around it all.<br /><br />Bottom line? If you like psychological thrillers, do not - I repeat, do not miss this one!barbed wire and inaccessible?

B002RVCD6O|5.0|I thought it was a great movie and a great addition to my film library I have no complaints here.
B004WJREMW|5.0|If you're a classic rock fan, you're not going to like this record. If your idea of a great McCartney song is No More Lonely Nights, you're not going to like this. But if you're open to electronic music, to lyrical playfulness, to experimental musical wanderings, you're going to LOVE this. This record was way ahead of its time: Temporary Secretary, Secret Friend, Check My Machine, and instrumentals like Frozen Jap are all astonishing. There are some gorgeous ballads here like One of these Days and Summer's Day Song. And of course there's Coming Up. What other artist but Paul could pull off such an unusual record -- played and sung and recorded pretty much by himself. Some Macca fans hate, and will never get it. Their loss. Much like Ram, this album has attracted more and more appreciation and I think that will only gain steam as the years go by. It's brilliant -- if you just relax and enjoy.
B007HO392S|5.0|Carrie underwood as always her singing voice blow me away,somehow I sense she puts A lot of her self into her music and it shows,when it's heard overand over.
1579128149|5.0|This book is awesome.  It has petty of picture and easy to read explanation on each an every element.  The book talks about the atomic structure and number.  Also, how these elements are use in today world.  If you want an easy to read book with a lot of information for young and old look no further.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|One of the greatest men of our modern world who like others who followed tried to teach humanity that the way to living peacefully is not by killing others.  A classic movie--extremely well done--with a message for everyone.  The country is India---but could be the Middle East today

1926778537|5.0|I'm not a fan of the Darksiders video games, but Joe Mad has been my favorite comic artist since he started drawing the Uncanny X-Men in the '90s. I bought the first volume (The Art of Darksiders) when the first game came out and couldn't have been happier with the ART. The binding on the first book was TERRIBLE though. With this book it seems that the binding issues have been improved, and the art is again AMAZING. The only complaint I have (it's not really a complaint though) is that I wish some of the images were bigger. There are literally 100s of small pictures that I wish I were bigger so I could see all of the details! If you're a Joe Mad fan, you must add this book to your collection!
B00APUTEBG|5.0|Very exciting film from the first momment. This leading man reels you in like a fish to the shore and leaves you wanting more and more. His brooding blue eyes and slumping shoulders lets the viewer know he does not want to spend a minute with his loving family never mind a week. It was fantastic to see his transition when they are taken from him. As the saying goes you never know what you have until its gone holds true and exciting to watch this young man fight with all he has to get them back. Full of physical action and emotional twists and turns left me wanting more so I watched it again.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|This will take some work but its all together life changing. Very well written. I have recommended this book to everyone I know.
B0002Z0EYA|5.0|Even though its not the best take on Homer's the Iliad, its still immensely good. Especially when Brad Pitt plays Achillies, the greatest warrior in all the world's antiquity. Especially when its shown of how Agamemnon was a greedy, fat, strutting pig who had united the greeks just to line his pockets. Him and Achillies clash endlessly over everything, from Achillies having to fight battles against other nations hero's on down to him having to answer to Agamemnon. The part of where Paris seduces Helen whose miserable with her lush, womanizing husband Menelaius and decides to go to Troy with Paris is when the movie gains speed. That's when the Greeks mobilized their fleet, Achillies beating them to the beach and slaughtering at least a dozen or more Trojans, taking Apollo's temple, and desecrating it for good measure. In it he finds Breiseis, a Trojan noble woman who chose to be a preistess to Apollo who stirs him as the proverbial woman all men want but can never have. Agamemnon, just to spite and annoy Achillies takes Bresies as a slave making Achillies decide to sit out the next battle. This causes the Greeks to lose Ajax their second best fighter, Menelauis, and a sizable peice of their army. Agamemnon reluctantly gives Bresies to Achillies, who says she's know men like him her whole life and him repling that he was born this is what he is. That night she tries to slit his throat, only to have him make love to her in such a way she sleeps in his bed into morning. Achillies looks at her and considers something amazing for him, leaving Troy and the glory he'd have for all of time from fighting there. That night Achillies with Breises she asks him if he could leave this war, he replies could you leave Troy? His meaning if she could forget about her family, her culture, her country, her home he could forget about glory. Then his cousin is killed, and Achillies kills Hector dragging the body behind his chariot. That night Priam begs Achillies for Hector's body, discovering Briseis is alive and takes the two back to Troy. The Greeks desperate, play a tactic of subterfuge with a hollowed out horse and make it into Troy and begin the slaughter of Troy and its populace. Briseis is saved from Agamemnon by Achillies, only to be struck down by Paris and as he sits dying he looks at the only woman he ever truly loved with his very soul and says because of her he knew peace throughout a lifetime of war. Briseis escaping with the remaining Trojans to Mt. Ida pauses at the summit of the mountain looking at Achillies Funeral pyre a look of lose and being lost. A good movie, but read the Iliad first.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Great book - a mix of Stephen King and Tess Gerritson.  Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes having the creeps when the lights are off at night and its time for bed!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I couldn't put this game down for hours! It's a huge challenge and also so much fun! My boyfriend had to pry me away... lol
B000002UDG|5.0|The music took me down memory lane.  Its a great collection of love songs, a good variety with a few other artists singing like Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder.
0446554995|5.0|At last a really good read from my favorite writing team. Have read ALL the books they have written, did not enjoy the last two as much but they are really back on track with Two Graves. Of course the plot is absurd, this is a Pendergast novel but I could not put it down and was so sorry to get to the last page. Now I will have to wait and wait for the next installment.
B008L1VZS6|2.0|The notes mention that Verdi chose the least worst story available to get this one out in a hurry. The other choices must have been terrible. Has some good performances, but it is not one that I would watch over and over like La Traviata
B003DZX3SA|5.0|Package came very quickly and in great condition. Only problem was that the disc had come loose and got scratched a bit, luckily it still works fine.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|This was the perfect gift. It was extremely affordable, we bought as many as they allowed and we are enjoying it!
B006LSZECO|1.0|I cannot believe I wasted 3 evenings on this book...almost stopped reading it several times- but thought gotta be a fab ending based on all the \\"buzz\\" this book has gotten. So much defied credibility . I mean seriously $200000+ credit card purchases which means easily available receipts & no one - not the police detectives not his expensive lawyer ever bother to go see if any of these sales people even remember ever seeing Nick. Small town I mean come on-there would be many who remembered her making purchases of specific items. I found myself talking out loud to no one- great big \\"ah come on really????\\" And then that lame sadly pathetic cheating the readers Non-ending. I only wish I had been reading an actual hard cover & not on my kindle. At least I could have thrown the book at the wall. Utterly frustrated reading experience- will not be reading her books again AND SO SO glad I did not purchase others as I was going to-based on the fuss over this when I purchased this. I am still angry an hour after finishing it- like the other reviewer said (&something I did not know) when Ms Flynn got stuck with no idea how to end it she just should have shelved it. But to each his own because it does seem lots enjoyed it- So again just one disappointed readers opinion- so please if you read this and disagree w/any of my review remember \\" to each his own\\" & happy new year all.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I loved this movie!  I will definitely buy it because of the music and a cappella performances, not necessarily the story line - which was somewhat predictable as other reviewers mentioned.  But I didn't order this movie to be surprised by intellectual plot twists, nor to be taken on a philosophical ride about the meaning of life; I just wanted to feel good during a tough time, and this did just that.<br /><br />Good movies are hard to come by these days, so my high rating reflects that. Great songs and performances, a few laugh-out loud moments, a couple stand-out comedic characters (Fat Amy was the funniest), and overall sweet and enjoyable.<br /><br />I wouldn't pay $20 bucks for it, but once it hits $10 or less, it's worth a purchase to keep handy as a pick-me-up. (I would pay $20+ for timeless movies or special effects masterpieces.)  Hope to see the cast, especially Fat Amy, in future comedies (she was hilarious in Bridesmaids!)
B0063IH60K|5.0|Another great classic old game the whole family can enjoy to pass the time,even our 6yr old like to play this game.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This lovely book is perfect for any and all seasons.  What a beautiful journey!  Children find out what it means to be children in a true child's fashion: passionately, stubbornly, freely, joyfully.  The children come alive as you read.<br /><br />NOTE:  I read this book as a young adult.  This is a 're-read' for me.  AND it is my very first reading experience on my Kindle Fire HD 7!!!  Exciting stuff!!!  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Thank you, Amazon!
B004WGGQPQ|1.0|Bought for 6yr old daughther and you cannot use it on a kindle fire. So we bought something we can't use. Our mistake I guess should have read it a little more closely. So beware read all details before you buy.
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|I have no complaints when it comes to the shipping and condition of this product, both were excellent service and quality. The album on the other hand sucked! I am an Alicia Keys fan of her old album but this was nothing but a waste of ear space.
B00A757EFW|1.0|Another one I got without reading the fine print , could not use on daughter kindle fire , so will try to get right one for kindle.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|Daughter is hooked on this game and probably could play it day and night if we would let her. good choice to buy.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|As with the other Ice Age movies, we just laughed and were mesmerized by the action and story line.  It was fun, for all ages in our family, from teens to geriatric.
B004UID2LC|2.0|can anybody tell me  if it is free when u download it??<br />to get back at me, just create a review and say what u know and say that u r talking to prettygirl!! ok
B008VBYN80|3.0|Fun and I haven't had to spend real money yet. Easy to learn. Will see if it keeps going. Worth a try.<br /><br />update ... this gets hard to play without spending money or having friends that also play. I could find no easy way to finf\d other people playing to friend them and pass quests.
0811879542|5.0|Will use this as a regular gift for any of my close friends and families children.  Such a fun learning tool.  Had to purchase an additional copy for myself after giving it to a close friend!
0156027321|5.0|It is one of those books you wont want to put down until you read it all. Makes you reflect on the important things in life.
B000FCK65W|4.0|Although this book was intriguing and interesting, there were a few things I didn't like about it. For me, it didn't get that interesting until half way through the book. Also, there seemed to be many irrelevant details and characters. I still enjoyed reading it as it had a unique plot and kept me interested.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It seems the first thing I do when I get started is check the conditions I have to look foward to for today and the days to come.
B00846REIS|3.0|This book is very similar to Fifty Shades of Grey. I found myself rolling my eyes at some points, but I still was able to read the whole thing. The second book is better, though. And I wasn't aware that there is a third book that has not been released so I'm waiting with bated breath for it.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|I heard &#34;Lights&#34; from her while I was in a department store and I wrote down the lyrics so I could track it down.  It led me to this album and it was on Amazon for only a couple bucks.  It seems a crime I only paid that much for such a beautiful work of art!  Each song has so much feeling and love put into crafting it.  I know I sound like I worship her or something, I don't usually comment in that way, but this album was very striking to me.  I've listened to it over and over.<br /><br />Some of the songs aren't really as catchy as &#34;Lights&#34; but even when they aren't they're still amazingly well-written and her voice is so soothing and subtly powerful.  Ellie Goulding doesn't need to yell or curse or bad-mouth anything or even put much force into her singing in order to sound powerful.  There's this maturity, gentle grace to the execution and it's very refreshing to hear.  Sure the more anthemic, in-your-face female singers are good, but this is something that's great as it is.<br /><br />This album is WELL worth the money.  For a hard-rock/electronic fan like me to be able to get into this album as I have, it makes me think that her talent and style can be a bit more wide-ranging and appealing to more people than for those who listen to only pop or alternative.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Got this game a while ago for a cheaper price,but I think although it is fun it needs more characters.I do recommend this game
B007X76Y58|5.0|I've been a Depeche Mode fan for a long time, and I've only been able to somewhat get into Dave Gahan's solo efforts.  I like some of the songs a lot, but this album is completely amazing.  Not one of these songs are of any less quality than the others.  Soulsavers wrote and performed the music and they have such a beautiful, melodic, dark, soothing sound and Dave Gahan's vocals matched perfectly.  I hope they do another album with Gahan, I'd LOVE a follow-up to this!  I've listened to it over and over and each time it gets better.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm on this app 24/7.There is fashion,DIY,tips and so much more.I am so happy with this app and a highly recommend it.Plus it is free.
B003ELMR9E|5.0|I hadn't seen this since it was in theaters and was mainly looking to complete my Christopher Nolan Blu-Ray collection.  I thought it was Pacino's best recent performance and if you like Nolan's style than this is worth checking out.  The picture and sound is amazing and I liked the features.<br /><br />I received the order in the mail far sooner than expected.  I hadn't been able to find this movie on its own in stores, it was usually in a collection with &#34;Devil's Advocate&#34; and &#34;Seven&#34;.  Since I bought it, of course I've been seeing it in stores, but the price here was good.
B004J4WN0I|4.0|This series was recommended by a friend and I am very glad he did!  Great characterization, New mythology for me, and I really enjoy urban fantasy.
B009GED3HS|5.0|This shows you just how wacky life actually is for people in their 20's going into their 30's who are developing their careers and personal lives. Nothing is cut and dry and anything can happen!<br />The only thing I dislike is the canned laughter. Why do shows still use that crap?
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|I had a lot of fun watching this movie.  I'd love to own this bear.  Predictable plot but very entertaining nonetheless.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Funny, light movie- really enjoyed it. Streaming was sometimes not very clear and had pauses while it reconnected...so that was a bummer, but likely not Amazon's fault.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I think this movie was entertaining.  I had fun watching it.  It'd be interesting if they make a sequel out of it.
B004Z7AHTI|5.0|Great way to get all three at low prices with digital copies of each as well as Blue Ray and DVD.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Please see the review for Child of Eden. The reviews for each will be exactly the same. Service provider was great.
B007N8RULO|3.0|Those is a great game, easy to play and pass the time with. Thanks for the heat app, I play it over regular solitude everytime.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really enjoyed the book.  The ending was not too predictable.  It had some good twists and turns and surprises.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I didn't like the focus being on just half of the characters... I spent most of the book wondering what happened to Tyrion, Jon Snow, Dany and Stannis. So apparently I have to read Book 5 to find out. Not sure I have the time to do it, these books have dragged on forever!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|My kids wanted this for Christmas. We saw the movie in the theater when it first came out and now they're thrilled to have this at home. The quality is great. Good price on Amazon for this combo edition.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Kept moving from character to character, which kept me reading. Although I must say I was not happy with the murder of Catelyn & Robb, why kill them off? But overall it was a page-turner.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Not the best happy ending..<br /> But still was worth reading. I would definitely read again. Can't wait for movies to come out!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|What can I said that hasn't already been said?  I am part of the HUGE following for this Masterpiece Theater classic.  I had to own it!  Thank you for the fast delivery!
B005R2S3VE|3.0|This DVD seemed to be getting bad reviews.I found the audio quality acceptable and the video quality also acceptable,given the era it was recorded. What I found unacceptable was the low number of tracks on the disc.They obviously have a large number of tracks available and are stretching this out to as many discs as they can.So if you want to see vintage Chicago (good scenes of Terry Kath) buy it, otherwise probably pass.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|This cd gets better each time I listen to it. Catchy tunes with well written lyrics combined with powerful emotion makes for a great album
B004GHNIRK|1.0|don't buy this one! i deleted it once i had it, as it was just facts about the time period and not the story.
B000GCFG7E|4.0|Another great book by Lee Child.  Jack Teacher is a wonderfully developed character whose ideas of right and wrong are fun to experience.
0761171703|5.0|Great pictures! It is a pleasure going through the pages. The book takes you to an amazing journey. Well done!
B001QWBM62|5.0|I love this versatile little recorder.<br /><br />If you shoot video on a DSLR, this is what you need for professional audio recording.<br /><br />Awesome!
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are terrific in all their movies, but Shawshank Redemption is at the top of my list. I loved the fact that they each made it out and continued their friendship.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was awesome and I look forward to the movie and the other books. This is a great book and it was thought out well...
B009R9WB34|5.0|I thought the clean version of this album was excellent.  She has wonderful voice control.  This album should be one of her biggest sellers.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I chose four stars because I really got into the book and I was choosing sides and hating the character I didn't choose, but the end was awful. I feel like I didn't get any resolution and I'm just left hating with no gratification.
B00942S4OY|5.0|well 1D have done it again!!! given all us mums THE best gift for Xmas for our daughters/sons. Wonderful songs,brilliant lyrics and stupendous singing.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book will truly change you. It grabs your heart after the first chapter and never lets go. I love perks.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The writing was good but unbelievable that someone could merit out so much punishment, and the other person not know the real reason!
B007D2XSW0|3.0|It's not really worth the $2.50, considering the free versions available have WAAAY better editing options!! Would like better stickers, better graphic additions, &amp; MORE designs!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is a great book about a kid finding out who he is .this book shows the ups and downs of being a teenager. He becomes his own hero and realizes what he needs and wants in that moment. A great story that goes to show no matter how screwed up you are there is always someone willing to love you unconditionally .
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved everything about this trilogy!  The books were a wild ride that I didn't want to end!  Brava!  I hope there will be something more!
B004SUDPWI|4.0|The movie is excellent.  I had to send the product back twice as it kept freezing up at the same time/location on both copies on my Samsung Blu-ray player.  I have never had any problems with any other DVD that I played on my DVD player.  I believe there is a defect in the manufacturing of the product.  I did not ask for a third DVD to play.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Boring, could find anything I wanted to search up. I say that it must be rewritten re drafted and repeated over and over till publish it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I could not put this book down. The characters of Sky and Holder were amazing. Holder captured my heart with his unwillingness to give up and Sky captured my heart by not letting him. I would recommend this book to anyone who like a good mysterious romance novel.
B005LAIH3G|1.0|I read the first three books in the Barsoom series and John Carter missed the mark.  Now it will be years before another adaption will be attempted.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Good game with a variety of hidden objects and mini-games. Well-thought story and good graphics. Some walkthroughs don't explain about the locked cabinet in the manager's office. You need to find the key! Hint: It's in the same office in an object that the kindle replaces.
030759565X|5.0|I've read the reviews on this and looked through it when I received it.  The recipes are great.  I tried the one for the rice kris pies treats and had no problems.  Everyone I fed them to loved them .... and I'm looking forward to trying others.  It's nice to know that Ms. Perelman has a small kitchen like mine and can deal with it.  I don't have a problem with her personal recollections ... just adds to the charm of the book.  Great photography.  This is a cookbook you can trust.
B009X01D9U|5.0|It's all good!  I like very much the larger screen for watching movies.  And now I am stuck adding 7 more words.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This was a requested gift and my nephew was pleased with it. Now I am required to say more than is necessary, so here re you words.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|The plot develops beautifully, with sharply drawn characters, some new ones as well. I'm looking forward to reading the next book in the series.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great Show!!!  Couldn't stop watching it.  Keeps you coming back for more.  Made me cry and laugh.  Wonderful period story.
B004FGLOJ6|3.0|Of course the book is fabulous, but the typos are distracting and really out of place in a classic publication.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|Interesting story but VERY wordy.  The HO game is excellent and the variety of other puzzles is very good.  It offers a good combination of of multi-level scenarios at a challenging pace.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|makes you think.  very addicting.  love the sound effects.  got the game for my grandson,  but now I am a big fan
B002NZK5TG|5.0|Amazon is the best place to go for online shopping...Every since i got my movie \\"Little Shop of Horrors\\" Me and My friends and family came over and watched it everyday at least 5 times a day!!! I LOVE AMAZON &lt;3
B005OK721G|4.0|I had seen this on TV & thought it was the best action movie w/a female star.  Very well done & excellent action scenes.<br />Saldana was very good & obviously in excellent shape.  Enjoyed & would recommend to any &#34;action/drama&#34; enthusiasts<br />(but not like Willis/Stallone, etc. HIGH intensity ones).
B000SEGMAU|5.0|Changed my life. No doubt about it. Who needs a counseling session about life when you can read Tuesdays with Morris?
B008AVYOBC|4.0|Love their music, transport me to the 80's as soon as I pop it in my car player, fun to listen to..
B0050DIWFC|5.0|With a keen eye towards an intimate view into the depth of the character of a lawyer and father, Mr. Landay has superbly produced a highly entertaining, thoughtful piece of reading.  A cool and complicated story is told here with truth and sensitivity to the protagonist and his &#34;under-life&#34; (his most private thoughts, fears, and challenges).  Well Done, Mr. Landay!
B005WYFLNU|5.0|Awesome awesome.  My kids love and I don't find stickers stuck around my house.  Took this on a plane ride and it kept my 5 year old occupied for a while.
B006WQLH7G|3.0|This is made to work with an android phone. If you have a kindle fire as I do, some features such as the anti-thief & firewall wont work (you need a phone #).Still a little early to judge the overall performance. just downloaded.
B007HACDLK|5.0|From the moment I began reading, i was hooked. i couldn't put the book down until I finished it, and then I regretted that it was over.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have a Samsung Exhilerate and in my applications the icon for Kindle was already listed.  All I had to do was install it, set up my account with Amazon for the android and then was ready to download free, samples and purchase books.  Love it and now I don't have to purchase a Kindle Fire, although maybe down the road I will or a notebook.  But ;you can't go wrong with this product.  Thanks Samsung and Amazon.
B008OGJXJ6|5.0|It's Bob Dylan. As always, irresistible new sounds leap perfectly in Bob's own uniquely recognizable style and make another place for our own imaginings.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this simple to use calculator. I use it at work daily. The big buttons are perfect for my old eyes.
B004DM0UII|3.0|This app is okay. I've only listened to a couple of stations and they're not quite what I expected, especially for a paid app.<br /><br />I tried the Irish Pub station and was really expecting more pub like music. Not everything I listened to was really what I would define as &quot;pub&quot; music, which I would define as something you'd hear at an Irish session.<br /><br />I also tried the Wacken station because I thought it'd have a decent selection of heavy metal. I haven't had time to listen it a lot, but I thought the Pogues was an interesting choice for a metal channel.<br /><br />Anyways, these seem like random Internet channels and I'm entirely convinced that all of them are good. Maybe it's just what I'm into. I'll play around with it more and see where it ends up.
B0039YZPZ4|1.0|Didn't enjoy this movie at all. I could hardly stay awake, it was so boring. Very disappointed. I do not recommend it to anyone.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|There was nothing positive or redeeming about this movie.  The concept sounded really interesting, but the movie itself wasn't enjoyable.
B0027MJU00|3.0|Worth reading, I was a little disappointed based on all the hype and reviews for the novel.  Would recommend though.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I don't typically read Grisham novels but lived every minute of this one! Plenty of twists and turns that had me guessing until nearly the end.
1596590440|3.0|I enjoyed the informative content. It makes sense and brings to attention the many aspects of leadership, job, or career transition in a way that enables you to go into the change purposefully and effectively.  I wish I had this under my professional belt years ago. The downside: the speaker was not very dynamic and could have been less monotone to keep the listener's attention better.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|I rented this movie from Blockbuster last week and I'm glad it only cost me $2.99, because that's about as much as it was worth.  The storyline to me just never came together and honestly I just was not impressed with the fighting parts when compared to previous sequels.  They need to call it quits!!
B005WUHAX8|4.0|Great protector for the price! I have dropped my iPhone and gotten it wet several times and it is still like new.  I get a lot of compliments because it does not look like a case; it's much smaller than Otterbox so people think it's a pink iPhone... I love that it has a smaller profile than my old OB.<br />It is hard to hear calls without the earbuds in place. The regular phone and speaker phone are very hard to hear, presumably because the case does not have holes in it over the speakers. I remedy this by opening the bottom flap (where you plug the charger in) so I can hear better on speakerphone.
B000VNMMR0|4.0|just got it and it is awesome. I will be watching this movie for years to come. Can't wait for the new movie to come out next month
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was an entertaining, absorbing read. It also had some surprising twists and turns that I really enjoyed and that made it hard to put down.
0307387178|2.0|I am in the middle of this book and I will probably finish it, but I am skipping large sections and it doesn't seem to matter.  The book is boring and pointless.  I don't care about Chris.  If he was worthy of a book about his life, then Krakauer missed the mark.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Was a quick paced well thought out story plot with a surprising endings. It showed you  heroism and the true meaning of friendship. It tells you about trust and honor and belief in your darkest hour even in the worst of situations that you have someone to believe in when no one else is there for you.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I read this book in Afghanistan, I really liked it. First Stephen King book I have read. Really good book.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|This is a good book but not the greatest it's fine if you like dairy of a wimpy kid books so do what you want with your money.
B008U7ZPHS|4.0|I found this book interesting and funny. One of my dislikes of the book is the favouritism towards the Greeks than the Romans another dislike is the ending by  only because I have to wait for the next book to come out! Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this book! I would recommend this book to customers from 8-14<br />years old. :)
145150506X|4.0|This book is written in the prose of Edgar Allan Poe's times which can be somewhat puzzling, especially when obsolete terms are used.  Nevertheless, it's interesting reading.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Product was in great shape, not a thing wrong with it. Received it right away, before christmas. GREAT buy, i recommend
B007GATVYI|5.0|First book, that I red on my kindle. Altho I had to zoom in on every page, because of 6' screen, I didn't consider that as a problem.<br /><br />Story was great and inspired by author, bought my next book Word of Mouth Marketing.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Terrible app, clunky and buggy interface, unable to adjust variety of settings through this app... No go Jose, I am back to the browser Facebook I know and love / hate / love / hate....
B008IGP8RI|4.0|Move was a little gory but realistic.  Bought the sound track and it was a piece of junk.  No way to return it.  There were a lot of night scenes in the move and that made it very hard to see what was going on.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It was so good. I liked it a lot. Can't wait to read the next book. I'm going to be sad when it's over.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Mark, our hero of the story is too funny.  I enjoyed the story and laughed at Mark's humor.  If you have ever watched the 70's shows and the original Star Treks you will find this very funny and suspensful.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Really? this is the best you can do? This app is absolutely awful. Please fix the issues listed and listen to your users . you should really be ashamed--from project management through QA .
1439102732|2.0|I am new to reading Jodi Picoult and have been presently surprised by how much I like her books....However,  I am currently 80% through this book.  I am fine with gay people marrying and having children. I'm cool with Christians having their concerns.  I don't care what happens to any of these characters. They annoy me.
B005LAII12|2.0|The idea of a talking teddy bear that remains long after the novelty has worn off is a clever one.<br /><br />The story of a boy that needs to grow up when confronted by adult life and crises is a time honored tale.<br /><br />The animation and voice acting was fabulous.<br /><br />So, where did the story go wrong?  I appreciate Seth MacFarlane's sense of humor (and his singing voice, check out [[ASIN:B004T5IW2K Music Is Better Than Words]]).  He has been willing to gore sacred cows in many walks of life.  MacFarlane's irreverence is refreshing, and like [[ASIN:B005CHTXWC Robot Chicken: Season Five]] about 10% of his jokes are pants wettingly funny, 80% are amusing, and 10% just fall flat.  Those are pretty good odds for humor across such a wide front.<br /><br />Unfortunately in the case of Ted, there was about 25% that were just horribly offensive.  I'm no prude and can certainly laugh at myself, my culture, my religion, etc.  &#34;Family Guy&#34; and &#34;American Dad&#34; have their moments, but generally there is only one or two missteps an episode.  In Ted, the level of callousness and crudity were past the line enough to make the film unfunny.  I'm not talking about political correctness.  When Ted tells his manager that he used produce to fornicate with and then sold it to an indigent family, it does not come off as funny.  And, the examples are legion.<br /><br />The other major issue I have is that Ted drew in a fair number of kids.  It is a movie about a talking teddy bear after-all.  I heard a couple of boys that appeared to be between 9-10 talking about Ted on the Metro last week.  Sure, sure, where are the parents, but I could imagine some parents screwing up by letting their very young kids watch a movie about a talking teddy bear.  You don't want to know which parts the boys were hooting about.  :-(<br /><br />I just watched a new episode of Family Guy last night and mostly enjoyed it.<br /><br />Seth you let me down on Ted.<br /><br />Sorry, I cannot recommend this movie.t recommend this movie.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I really liked this game. It was fun! I wish it had lasted longer though. I finished it in one day..
B007JM4CWY|4.0|This game is great and you can become addicted quickly. Only major problem I found with the game is it crashes occasionally. A hint feature would be useful.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|I really enjoyed this even though I wasn't expecting to.  Tom Hardy and Jason Clarke are really good in it.  Shia LeBouf is pretty good in it too, and showed an acting range I didn't think he had.  It's pretty gorey, quite a bit of blood, but it's a really cool story especially if you're from the south east.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A wonderful idea of an astronaut accidentally left behind on Mars. Left to survive all on his own he is most inventive. Most of all he has a sense of humour. Something that you very rarely see in Science Fiction, I wonder why? A good sense of humour can help you get through most things. I don't know if the author Andy Weir is a Scot but he certainly has a Scottish sense of the absurd, two thumbs up \\"hey.\\" Someone mentioned they were convinced that the writer had to be an astronaut, the research is that good. And a real laugh out loud moment, when you don't expect it, is good for the reader, look >>>>> (. Y .) boobs.<br /><br />If you want more on Creative Writings of Andy Weir search \\"Andy Weir.\\"<br /><br />He says he doesn't do it for money \\"(Amazon doesn't allow posting Kindle content for free, so I set the price to the minimum of $0.99.)\\"<br /><br />A great piece of Science Fiction.<br /><br />The audio book is well done. For the story I would give it five stars, the narration gets a four. I found the voice suited the character very well, it may be my imagination, but on occasion, depending on what he says, he sounds like John Wayne. Tbe Duke played many parts, but never an astronaut. I gave a four for the voice because it doesn't seem to captue the sense of humour of the character, the lines are said but just  not in away were you laugh. Reading the book I can remember a couple of laugh out loud moments. Still the overall they did a good job with tne audiobook.<br /><br />A word of advice play on the slowest speed so you capture all the technical jargan.<br /><br />Oh, I have learned the book has been optioned by MGM.<br /><br />Looking for more from the author to be published on amazon.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|They're easy to use my 6 year old niece put them up herself.  She loves them.  Great way and inexpensive way to decorate a room.
B0009UC81A|5.0|This movie takes me back.  Being as I live an hour or 2 from Chicago, this movie was always popular here. Delivered on time & in excellent shape.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|It was a wonderful movie.  Service getting it to me was great.  Thanks. Just in time for the holidays.  Happy New Year
B001HM1PFO|4.0|Used to watch this in the late night theaters in the 80's.  Not as much fun watching on TV with the kids but was happy they got to experience it - sort of.<br /><br />Still, can't explain Dr. Frank-N-Furter or the Time Warp dance to the kids without them seeing the show.
B0037YOMWS|4.0|Is a great calculator, but you can't change the language so if you aren't in América is hard to understand the functions
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|This book is all about games and 80's nerd trivia.  I happened to enjoy it quite a bit because I &#34;got&#34; most of the references.<br /><br />My only issue with this one is that sometimes the writing felt a bit juvenile.  Would have given it 5 stars if not for that.  Still, I really enjoyed it.
B00119ZMKW|5.0|got hooked. its a classic syfy show. follow up to a great movie. its something you can watch everyday. pretty good plot and good acting
B0073XV2W2|5.0|I can't say enough about the author, Daniel Suarez.  After reading Daemon and Freedom multiple times I was itching for his next work and he did not disappoint.<br /><br />Lots of cool and current technology and nothing really out of the realm of possibilities makes this one topical and a great read.<br /><br />If you enjoyed Suarez's other two, you'll love this one.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|At first I found the book boring but as I read on I couldn't put it down.  When things started to fall into place and I was understanding where it was heading I enjoyed Hopeless.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I originally listened to the audiobook version of this one and just couldn't stop listening.  I ended up purchasing the e-book for my boys who run cross-country.<br /><br />Very inspiring.  If you want to be inspired to start running, especially after experiencing pain while running, read this book.  You won't regret it.
0739384163|5.0|Bought this for my near-blind father-in-law and he finished it in almost 2 days, and can't wait to start the next book!
B008I3QZKU|5.0|Let me first start off by saying that I like the Killers enough to have collected all their albums to date. They play a good tune, turn a clever phrase now and again, and sound good playing in the background whilst I do my chores or surf the internet. Good stuff. Sometimes even great.<br /><br />Then \\"Battle Born\\" came along, and I was blown away.<br /><br />Now, I'm not trying to change anybody's mind. I'm not trying to say this is the best album in the world. I AM saying that in my humble opinion, this is the best album I've heard all year, and one of the best I've heard in the last five. Does that mean anything? Probably not. But I simply cannot get enough of this album. I play it most every day, taking breaks for new albums and video games, but always coming back to this one. Note I mentioned video games: I LOVE video games, basically eat sleep and breathe them. \\"Battle Born\\" has seriously cut into my video gaming time, because I just want to hear it \\"one more time\\". Again and again. That's saying a LOT.<br /><br />Will you like \\"Battle Born\\" as much as me? Couldn't say. I will say that I have a new respect for the Killers that I didn't have before. I like their previous albums even more than I did. But I can honestly say I LOVE this album. Love love love it so much I want to share it with everybody I come into contact with. It's just that good.
0756407125|5.0|Very good book can't wait for the third one. I still like the first one better but this book is still great!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|don't have to be a rocket scientist to play. easy to operate and play yet has a simple theme to story line.
0756405890|5.0|This book has a great story and is written superbly! If you are looking for a book to read this is one you must check out.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|good game enjoyed it enough to buy it. but it wasn't a long game at all and that alone is disappointing that bit ended quickly
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|WHOA!!!  Great book.  Unexpected.  All I have to say.  I couldn't put it down.  I am a Colleen Hoover fan.
078322740X|5.0|It's impossible to beat the laughs when Goldie Hawn and Steve Martin team up! Favorite line is &#34;Let's spend it!&#34;
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Best musical purchase I have made in a long time!!!!!!!! Reccomended to all of the hard core 70's rockers out there.
B0092GEUIG|5.0|Paul McCartney at his best in this recent recording. Given as gift and warmly received by long-time fan of McCartney.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I don't care how old you are, what part of the world you live in or whether you are single or married, all three of these books are a MUST READ!!!  Don't take it too seriously, just enjoy and read with an open mind!!!  :-)))
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|It could be a great game like command and conquer except it takes too long to level up. Also, most of the good items cost stars which do not come easily unless you decide to pay real money.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Ingenious idea. Album has a unique way of bringing characters together to give the reader a lesson to rememmber.  This story especially had a conceptualization that held the readers attention
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love playing games.  Solitaire is one of my favorites.  I love being able to play it on my Kindlefire.
1250006341|5.0|I love the show,  I've actually been there, and when I found the book and gave it to a friend who also loves the show,  she was absolutely delighted.  The condition of the book is excellent as well.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is a beautifully written emotional roller coaster I couldn't ( or wouldn't ) jump off of until every twist and turn rocked me.
B003UYUR0G|5.0|the film is one that i have always liked, so i recommend it to anyone who wants to see action, comedy, and some interesting characters. The shipping and price make ordering from amazon the best way to go.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Took a chance on this one for free and am now hooked! Start off way easy but then becomes quite fun as the levels get harder.  Would highly recommend.
B000005AYL|2.0|This record came in a plain black sleeve, not the original cover. While the sound is good that aspect is disappointing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Fascinating and at times intense.  A page turner that I found hard to put down.  A great read for young and old and especially for the adventurous.
B005LAIISA|4.0|i liked the whole series great for kids so if you have a child or are a child at heart you might like it to happy shopping everyone
B009JBZH54|5.0|If you want all three movies ....this is what you need. Great set with a lot of extra bonus features and great price.
B003UESJ9M|5.0|i enjoy this movie. i thought the story was good.the acting was okay.<br />the song were great & i will watch it over & over again.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Thank God I already purchased the 3rd book! Absolutely the best trilogy I've ever laid my eyes upon!!! Diehard mocking Jay fan
B004J64QSI|4.0|Simply wonderful version of the Victor Hugo classic. Small warning, longest curtain in theatrical history.  Everybody but the janitor takes a bow and even he may have been in there somewhere. But if you are a Les Miz fan you will love this 25th anniversary concert DVD from the O2.
B00846REIS|5.0|A wonderful read. Everything a woman wants in erotica with a love story intertwined.  And little hits of the really naughty to put the cherry on top.
B008ELUEQC|4.0|There are many different ways to go with holiday music, and Rod Stewarts hails the holidays of 2012 with his trademark voice that always remind me of his folk rock days during the 70's. If you like Rod Stewart, you'll enjoy this album.
B0031RS7X6|4.0|This book is based on such a funny premise - you're on a plane, think it's going to crash, and decide to confess all secrets to the stranger in the seat next to you, knowing you'll die... then you don't... but hey no worries, you'll never see him again... dun dun duuun....! Like I said, funny.<br />I just didn't really get into Calvin, and hey it's not his fault... *bad Sophie Kinsella*... that I didn't know him better.<br />Still I'd read it again
B000WCSBQ6|1.0|Warning to all buyers - This battery is made in Indonesia, not in Japan. Despite several attempts, the ad is not being changed to warn the future customers that it is not built in Japan. Buyer beware!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book was unlike any other I have ever read. I hate it when stories become predictable and I have to say that there were a lot of things that I didn't see coming throughout this book.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|great series and got my brother into it as well so he purchased all the seasons, as he does not have cable or internet.
1932100660|5.0|I was so intrigued by reading the \\"Look Inside\\" excerpt pages for this book on Amazon that I ordered a copy for myself and even sent one to my mother who has her own health problems she's battling.  After reading the book in its entirety, I was not disappointed.<br /><br />The author began as an unbelieving opponent to the idea that eating a diet rich in animal protein caused disease, so he sets out to set the record straight, only he ended up proving himself wrong.  The author cites study after study that he has either done himself or referenced to support the health benefits of a plant-based vegan diet, free of any animal products: milk, meat, fish, eggs, cheese.  In his research, he uses casein, a protein which is found in milk, to support the idea that the progression of diseases including cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune disease, which he names \\"diseases of affluence,\\" is the culprit that is killing us.  To further support his argument, he uses data from multiple countries around the world where these diseases are virtually non-existent, primarily in regions where plant-based diets are the main source of nourishment.  The more meat and milk that people eat in any area, the more these diseases seem to be present.<br /><br />Whether or not you choose to change your lifestyle by what you read in this book is up to you.  However, I really think this should be mandatory reading for every individual, healthy or those with diseases.  I have been meat-free for over a month and am just starting to realize the beneficial changes occurring to my body.  Once you read it, you decide what's right for you.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I love Cut the Rope so I had to try Pudding Monsters. It is amazing! I cannot wait for the update and new levels.
B0098VXE50|1.0|Pleeeaaase stop sending those irritating emails for a rating. i just got this and havent watched it yet. If I want to review it I will. But stop the spam.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I'm a DeMille junky. I love his hero's satirical retorts and anti-establishment rants. His books are becoming formulaic, however, and the endings are easy to see coming. The Panther was a set-up for another Panther encounter. But, I'll buy it!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Really good game. Reminds me of the game that I played as a child! Fun time passer. Just don't like how fast the energy wears out.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the book an l am looking forward to reading the rest of the series. I.  Would recommend it to everyone.<br />Mmcgarrie<br /><br />.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I enjoyed his story.  I have been interested in NDE for awhile.  I am a nurse and I appreciated that he provided the medical information about what happened to him. The appendix giving the scientific explanations of what could cause this and why those explanations fell short was interesting. He is brave to share his story in the setting of working in the medical community. I imagine he has had many roll their eyes. For some reason the idea that we continue beyond life makes some uncomfortable.
B001TXWJ4M|4.0|Even thought the first season was  a bit slow, but TV series has proven to be one of the best.  Has many twists & turns to keep viewers interested.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I was first introduced to Nelson DeMille with his book &#34;The Gold Coast&#34;. I have liked John Corey and Kate Mayfield in previous books. No one would need to know the author's name to know this book is written by a man. It is easy to speculate that John Sutter and John Corey are identical twin brothers but who cares; every time I pick up a Nelson DeMille book I find myself reading late into the night and waking up early to read more.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Great addicting game. Its responsive and doesnt freeze up or anything. i would recomend it to anyone looking for something to just keep your mind busy trying to beat your best time.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I recommend this book to EVERYONE. Her trek was amazing, the story is inspiring and her willingness to share so much about herself was refreshing.
B0076DELIG|5.0|i love all of his books and thnk i have read everyone...  he does a good story and keeps you coming back  i will buy his next and all new ones after that !!!!!  keep up the great work....love every one of them  thank you
B00AHSINKO|2.0|From the little viewing they give you on tv,promoting this movie, showing,probably  the only funny part..I have to say the acting was very good from both actors.. but the story was so demeaning to the Meryl Streeps character, all this energy she put into having her husband Tommy lee Jones become interested in her romantically again was just a little over the top...This reminds me of a movie produced in the 40's.. I have been married for 40 yrs. & know I would never go to this lenghts she did...it had a story book ending but boy did she have to fight for it!!!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I love all of Flynn's Rapp books. word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word word
B0073PZIBQ|4.0|Very good information on Bird Watching. If you are a beginner or an expert it was good...Gives you an insight on how competitive this hobby  can become...........
B007THA4FI|4.0|For Rowling's first adult novel, I thought it was pretty good. There were a lot of characters, but I enjoyed following their development as the story progresses. If I had read the synopsis of the book and it didn't have Rowling's name on it, I might not have picked it up. But overall, I enjoyed the story even though the specific story-line isn't my usual read.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I had never watched any of these before this purchase and I was blown away. I am now a huge Batman (Christian Bale type) fan!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|It was so hard to put the book down! Martin keeps you hooked the entire time. Even though it's a long book, it never had that dragging feeling.<br /><br />*SPOILER*<br />Even though I hate it when authors kill characters I like, I've told myself that it would be a rather boring book if it was always &#34;bad guy dies and good guy lives&#34;. Even J.K. Rowling showed no mercy in her last few Harry Potter books. So even though I don't like it, I've come to accept it.
B0042RUMIW|5.0|We choose this because Sting is unbelievable with the orchestra - it enhances his performance and blasts every few weeks in our home!!
B001RTSPVY|5.0|BEST SHOW EVER ON AMC WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING THIS SHOW FROM DAY 1  GREAT ACTORS VERY<br />CREATIVE I GIVE THEM A 10  I WISH THERE COULD BE A SEASON 6 AND 7
B009DH2PP4|5.0|This book is awesome!  I found it extremely helpful to not only get started brewing but to expand my knowledge of what is actually happening in the brewing process.
B00A757EFW|5.0|This is one of my favorite oldie games.  Glad I was able to get it for my Kindle.  Great way to relax.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game because of the characters ,and because  u get go board's and most likely  for the  MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Love playing majhong challenges your mind.  Wish you had more version of it to play.  Would ge them all.  Highly recommend.
0446580848|5.0|I purchased this novel for my mother who is a fan of the author. She started reading the novel a few days ago, she seems to be really enjoying it. She comes home from work reading the book.<br /><br />I will give an update when my mom finishes the novel.<br /><br />So far perfect gift for mom...her only complaint is that the book is bulky. The soft cover doesn't come out until later in 2013. I bought this in November 2012.
B001NHNG64|5.0|The Reacher series is one of my favorites due to a creative plot that changes in many ways in each book, the accuracy of detail in almost every aspect, and the consistency of Reacher´s character. Lee Child does an amazing job of sticking to his characters personalities, researching areas of his plots with extreme thoroughness, and keeps the plots changing in ways to keep readers interested throughout the full duration of the book.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Long time Clancy fan and definitely enjoyed this edition. A fast paced read even if the ending seemed a little rushed.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I loved this book I bought it because it was inexpensive and I was very short on money. I was totally amazed by how good it was. It's not the kind of book I usually read but it was great! I have recommend it to all my co-workers , family and friends. I am looking forward to the movie now.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|It is good to see the old timers in action. The one liners were funny. We need more formidable enemies for the expendables like the wise guys of Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, or even Vin Diesel and Mat Damon.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Object of the game is to group all the pudding monsters together, trying to cover the star tiles to earn extra points. Cute game!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|The lyrics to Rodriguez’s songs are as true to life now as they were when they were written.  He is truly a poet and story teller.  The musical accompaniment is rewarding in its sound and character.  This is truly one of those alums you can listen to over and over.  After listening to this recording you can only hope he has not lost his poetic reflection on life and we will hear more from this artist.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love the book it is a hit in our classroom and I can't wait for the next book keep it going Jeff your doing a good thing for the children of the world
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I really like the writer, and this book is a &#34;can't put down&#34;  I had a bit of a hard time getting into it, I could not relate it to me, but it surprised me!!!  It relates to everyone!! I have recommeded it to every reader I know, it's a &#34;can't put down&#34;
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazing. It really got me wondering what was going to happen next.I can't wait to read the next book.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|have loved watching Planet Earth, it's been something I've wanted to own for so long. Seeing it in Blu Ray is even more amazing. definitely worth it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game  because it is multi player and solo plus it is a really addicting.I never want to stop playing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:)
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Loved all the books. So glad I own the movie. Seeing it in Blu Ray is even more amazing. definitely worth it!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I liked the books alot, a little slow at first, quite surprising the first book ended so fast, good thing I got all the books because once I started I couldn't put it down, have already loaned it out and recommended to friends,
B0002TJGQS|5.0|on time, and as advertised.  since we have a number of objects that require this particular battery, great to have them when needed.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My 10 year old son purchased this and really likes this game.  He recommends the game for everyone especially for those who like Star Wars AND Angry Bird.  My 13 year old says it is a great game, lots of cool features, and power ups!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love the intensity level and how the ending makes you wanna read Mockingjay even more. I would definitely recommend this book to everyone!!;)
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|this game was a lot of fun. couldn't put it down till it was over. it makes you think and I love the puzzles
B0060RZF3Y|5.0|These were a Christmas gift for my daughter who is 7 years old and love all things Polly.  These are very cute and she absolutely loves the umbrella's.  All pieces are seem durable and she is very happy with them.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great book that keeps you interested. I couldn't put it down.<br />The story is interesting and funny yet romantic and dirty.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read.  The author did a superb job in telling this amazing story.  Men like Adam Brown are real heroes and should be celebrated as such by society instead of the narcissistic losers currently considered \\"celebrities\\".  What amazed me about him was his faith and how he faced so many adversities during his life but just kept going.  Thank God for Adam Brown,  his family, and the men and women serving to protect our freedom every day!
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Cute romantic comedy drama.  If you need something to cuddle up to on a Sunday this is your movie.  This movie explores the complicated relationship of a father that has worked his whole life as a baseball scout and his daughter that was dragged along with him game to game.  Even though she harbors some bad feelings about how she was raised, in the end I think she grew up in a unique situation that she starts to appreciate as the movie progresses.  Enter a good looking an ex baseball player and the movie is a nice blend of family drama, romance and baseball.
B0099114WO|3.0|With these two veteran actors, I was just expecting a little more excitement.<br />Wasn't a bad movie---just was not up to their usual standards
B004EPZ08E|4.0|Love this movie...bought it for my Jennifer Aniston collection. Converting all my regular dvds to blu ray dvds. Still working on the collection!
B000OZ0NXA|2.0|Was unbeleivable even for an action fiction book....It was obvious what was going to be on the next page......It was entertaining but far out there.....
B0093H8H8I|5.0|This processor is absolutely fantastic for the price, and it beats out a lot of AMD's bulldozer CPU's.<br />It can handle games (with a good video card) and the integrated graphics are more than enough for anything except extreme gaming.<br />At this price point, you possibly couldn't ask for more. It's like a mini i5 since there are 2 cores which are both hyper threaded.<br /><br />Awesome!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|It's a great Disney movie - both for adults and children - and really speaks to those of us Scot ladies who know that the spirit of Scotland is alive in women as well as men!
B007D2XSW0|2.0|Please use the term undo.  It is a more familiar term and is used by other editing.programs.  Also, I expected there would be more editing tools.  What happened?
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|It's a great CD, and Susan's voice is, as always, a joy to listen to, but she still hasn't found &#34;her&#34; song - I thought with Someone to Watch Over me she might have, but she never sang the whole song in one piece - and in this CD, they're not &#34;her&#34; songs - I'm hoping she'll find one she can claim as &#34;her&#34; own - she has such a remarkable voice and such a wonderful story.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Overall this app greatly exceded expectations as far as content and user friendlyness.<br /><br />Cons: Ads, ocassional freezing/glitchyness<br /><br />Give it a try, the price is right
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I love this game. this is one of my top games. Game plays well on my kindle fire. I got it for free app of the day and I wouldn't buy it at 1.99. awesome game though.
B002PMV9K6|4.0|We watched this after finishing the book, I have to say that out of all 8 movies this one probably failed fans the most.  There was so much of the story left out and it seemed very rushed.  But still it's Harry Potter so it still gets four stars.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved the movie but am loving the book even more! Will definitely read all of them in the series!!!! Love it!
B00003CXI1|5.0|This is my favorite of all of the HP movies maybe because the kids were all still kids like the kids I was reading the books to.
B009439HEY|4.0|Hackett stuck very closely to the original arrangements so the music is spot on.  I did miss Gabriel and Collins on the vocals at first, but the fact that there are different vocalist end up making it more than just a best of collection.  Great job Mr. Hackett
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I think out of all the movies based on the books they did the best on this one and part 2.  There still was some stuff left out but overall the movie version is amazing.
B008D4AKYQ|5.0|Theis is Big Big Trains stongest efforts to date. Pretty and straightforward melodies accompanied by complex, lush arragement and great vocal harmonies.  You can hear Genesis in there but Big Big Train is truly an original.  Can't wait for Part Two.
B002DQDV6Y|5.0|This book was really great because it delved even deeper into the world of magic and what better way to learn more about who Voldemort was.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I always check my facebook account for news about my friends, chat and get uptodate information from them too.  I found so many lomg lost freinds through facebook and had reunited and reconnected with them.  Cheers to facebook.
B005COO1X6|5.0|I read this in a matter of hours after downloading it.  It was fantastic.  Much like other King &#34;car&#34; stories but still very worth the read!
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|Very easy to operate, informative and very accesseable.  I find the full information on anything I ask for. I will recommend it to all my friends.
B00271DNP4|5.0|The only thing I have to say is...WHY DIDN'T SOMEONE JUST USE THE DARN TIME-CHANGER TO GO BACK AND OFF VOLDEMORT BEFORE HE DID ANY HARM???
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|haven't checked / seen this yet, I subscribed for possible use for kids to entertain them.  Heard it;s okey so, I am looking forward to see it.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Abby and Travis are two people who are opposites...at least that what it appears to be.  However, being attracted to the &#34;bad boy&#34; always seems to be an issue with every girl.  Abby, wants to find love and happiness in normalcy..her head tells her this but her heart says differnt.  Falling in love with the wrong guy always seems wrong but for Abby...Falling in love with Travis is the only path she should be on.

Bad boys...Tattoos...Love....Sex...You will love this story and will instantly fall in love with Travis and Abby's lives.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I always check my emails and find it very easy to use, besides the privacy in itls use.  I can also respond through this yahoo emails right away.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The moments with perfect little sentences that could be quoted all of the time were truly inspiring.  Loved this book. BRAVO
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What can I possibly say about this book that hasn't already been said in hundreds of reviews.<br /><br />I could hardly breathe throughout this entire book. I was immediately drawn to Sky and Holder. The author did a wonderful job in intertwining these two characters from the beginning and all the way to the end.<br /><br />This book was so intense. At first thinking it was just some normal teenage love story but as I turned the pages there was so much more. From Holders & Sky's first encounter I couldn't wait to see where and how the author was taking these two.<br /><br />I loved the quirky things that came rumbling out of Sky's mouth and Holden's silent and careful demeanor. They complimented each other well. I melted with all of their Firsts.... And Forevers...<br /><br />Colleen Hoover did an outstanding job in developing a love story and turning it into so much more. I was captivated with this story. Their love, their connection, their pain, their healing story is one I will not soon forget.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like this simple game to pass the time waiting in thd doctor's office or anywhere else there is a wait.  It's easy to play and you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure it out.
B00A757EFW|2.0|I would give the graphics and music a 5 star rating, but game play only gets a 2.  Sorry. It was just too hard to get a hold of, especially with big fingers like mine.
B008K6HN8I|3.0|Does what it says but very Plain Jane. Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) were designed with intuitiveness in mind. The idea was that icons, buttons, and arrows were to be self explanatory, not arcane and ambiguous. Touch interfaces were to have taken that concept to the next level. While this app allows for navigation of the file system, it is anything but intuitive and leaves a great deal to be desired on the user interface level.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|This is a great app for accessing your home PC anywhere you have your Android device. The set-up is very easy only takes a few minutes.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Absolutely addictive viewing !  Definitely start with the first episode to develop an understanding of the many characters.  A wonderful series.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is a very nice game. The graphics are very nice, the pictures make sense and there isn't too much in them. The instructions are clear and easy to follow. Fun and entertaining.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|This product was delivered as advertised. The CD was packaged nicely, and the music is as advertised. The CD is Great!
B00846REIS|5.0|I was looking for something similar to 50 Shades of Grey and I definitely was not disappointed! I absolutely loved it!
B00A2BTCTC|5.0|I wish Rush would give this treatment to their entire collection; I know a few have been.<br />Incredible to listen to again for the first time!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is an excellent book and its great to be able to take it with me on my iPad and iphone.  Love it!!!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Although I have this series, not in Blu-Ray. Great addition to my collection! Now it's like watchingthe movie for the very first time.
B00355L2TU|5.0|This video is only 20 minutes which is the only amount of time i have to workout. It is a super intense 20 minutes that.you will feel the burn. Combines a interval mix of cardio and weights so the body.doesnt know what to expect next. Great video.
B005WYFLNU|5.0|I love the fact that they are reusable... my daughter even plays with the characters outside the sticker scenes... She loves them. Check out the dinosaurs and the home scenes, too!!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Prefer strategy games. I enjoyed this game before, and am so glad I now have on my Kindle Fire. Everyone should try.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|Great game for wasting time. The characters are so adorable and it's much more entertaining than most games. What makes it even better is that it is FREE! It's worth a try and I highly recommend it for any age. It is a great game for anyone who likes a cute penguin. Much better than angry birds and temple run combined. You should get it.
0545305497|5.0|Most people know the stories now.  When the movie came out, I wanted to read the books first.  I wasn't disappointed at all.<br />They were exciting, and the story of how some of the characters managed to survive against all odds was inspiring.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in awhile.  I couldn't put the book down.  I will definitely read more of Colleen's books in the future.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Syncing five computers/devices ... problems solved. Using &quot;The Secret Weapon&quot; methodology to use Evernote with GTD (Getting Things Done by David Allen). Google:<br />evernote GTD TSW
B00A77II0U|5.0|This game is great. It was the perfect length, had great puzzles and was really fun to play. I also really enjoyed the bonus content.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved this book. I could not put it down. Very hot and a great story line. Can't wait to read Reflected in you.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is an amazing book with so many adventures that make you want keep reading and  never<br />put the book down
B005V2EVBQ|1.0|I've had this cover for over a month and have tried everything I can to get it to keep the Kindle upright without success. I'm very unhappy with this product. This is very unlike anything from Amazon. I would not recommend this cover for anyone.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|I'm a si-fier. Love time travel movies. Action movies are<br />in my blood. This movie is terrible, not worth watching.<br />I won't spoil it for those who are going to watch it,<br />when it finally ended, I went uuuugh.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|A bit confusing in the beginning.  However hang in there.  By the time you get to the end, you have it and it is beutiful!  Very powerful and so unexpected!  Acting is great.  Well written.  Unique plot.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Nice, quick read. Very believable characters with depth and quirkiness. I'm not sure if I'd continue with the series but I may if I come across it again.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a great game with hours of fun! I love it. And it is all for free! It is fantastic!
B0095P31L6|1.0|This movie is nothing like the preview, I was sooo dissapointed that i paid to see it at the theater, i don't know what they were thinking, no plot, twisted metaphors and world views. I think this may have been the worst movie i have ever seen. It was nothing that the preview hinted it would be.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Love it! Hope to see it on stage someday!  Listen to this everyday at work! Favorite song - Gravity! So good.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Effective, functional, and best of all, free. Adaptable alarms fade in, or pick your favorite song to wake up to instead.
B000VYX8PE|4.0|I thought the book was good although many unfortunate things happened to the sad orphans. I would recommend this book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|AMAZING BOOK! It was very hard to put this one down. I would highly recommend this book to all whom are looking for a book to keep you on the edge of your seat.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was amazing it truly captured my attention the whole time. I would recommend this book to everyone Nicholas sparks did a great job once again.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|You have to love the smell unlike other dolls that have a plastic smell, this doll smell of vanilla right out of the box. Leave it up to the French.
1616960922|5.0|Pretty short, as expected from a novella, but it was just as compelling as all of Brandon Sanderson's stories. With just a few pages read, the characters appeal to you in a way that takes other authors several chapters. His imagination and invention of different types of magic is flawless and beautiful. I did not want the book to end! I am already attached to Shai and would love to read more of her. I'm always a fan of Mr. Sanderson's work!
0375413405|5.0|Myself and friends love this book.  We set aside time to try the recipes.  Have a lot of fun with it.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Sometimes found it hard to put it down, being so intrigued by this story!  It's no literary masterpiece but it certainty is an enjoyable read.
B007SAKYNS|4.0|A gift for my son.....he absolutely loved it. Would highly recommend it as gift for a novice wanting to experience the sounds of the vinyl album
B0017SWPXY|5.0|As a fan of auto racing, dogs, and emotionally precocious children, I may not be the most objective reviewer. Regardless, I really enjoyed reading this and would recommend it to anyone.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Mystery Manor is a great game. The only thing I wish is that the gems are easier to get. But other than that. It's a great hidden object game. Plenty of rooms to investigate.
B00000G3PA|5.0|Great movie.  I highly recommend anyone who has not see this movie to rent, buy or what ever your means are, to get it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is so addictive and fun I can not stop playing it there is at least 30 levels that are really challenging.
6305127646|5.0|This is an older movie but still good.  We have seen it probably 20 or 30 times and still enjoy it.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|I had wanted to get this CD for a while, and now that it's been some time since Ray Charles' passing, the price had come down and it was time for some new tunes.  Good listening while you drive, makes you wanna sing with them.
B000VWYJ8G|5.0|Really great movie.  Have watched them all and can't wait to see the next one.  I highly recommend anyone not wa

1451695195|3.0|This book is subtitled `A neurosurgeon's journey into the afterlife'. It describes Dr. Eben Alexander's life-transforming NDE (near-death-experience) of several days' duration in the ICU of a Virginia hospital, following his collapse into a coma when a rare strain of e-coli infected his brain and spinal column.<br /><br />The narrative alternates between an account of the author's life-story up to the onset of his sudden illness (adopted as a child, a husband & father, and successful brain surgeon) with details of the actual coma-induced NDE and the concerns of the various members of his family and medical community for his survival. The style is racy and easy-to-read, in no way dry or academic.<br /><br />Bottom line: like many thousands of people, Dr. Alexander obviously experienced a more-or-less classic NDE, generally reported to be similar in content but which differ in minor details. The difference here is that as an erstwhile scientific-reductionist neurosurgeon who would always explain away such experiences as some artefact of the mind, he finds himself confronted with the inescapable reality that consciousness is not a product of biological processes of the body, but a separate entity nonetheless real. `Appendix B' at the end of the book lists various proposed biological and psychiatric explanations routinely deployed to explain away this phenomenon (e.g. endogenous glutamate blockade with excitotoxicity, mimicking the hallucinatory anesthetic ketamine; or a sudden DMT dump) and rejects them all one by one as invalid or impossible.<br /><br />So does this book offer `Proof of heaven'? No more than thousands of other reported experiences of this type. The proposition is that because of Dr. Alexander's neurosurgical credentials his NDE is somehow more `valid' than those of other percipients. Surely the essential point is that these thousands of similar reports are mutually confirmatory, not that that of a neurosurgeon somehow brings a special importance to this category of human experience.<br /><br />The text has a pseudo-religious, new-agey tone - as well it might, from an author who miraculously survived death and had a life-transforming experience to boot. However this woo-woo alternates with arguments strongly grounded in the biological sciences, as the author is qualified to write with authority about the subject of the human brain from a medical-scientific perspective. The book was successfully promoted by the publisher and has enjoyed best-seller status, spotlighting this most intriguing and obviously real human experience, and that's no bad thing. But if you want `proof of heaven', you won't necessarily find it in this book.is category of human experience.<br /><br />The text has a pseudo-religious, new-agey tone - as well it might, from an author who miraculously survived death and had a life-transforming experience to boot.

B0060FXDCG|5.0|Its a really good trilogy, but think they could have done a lot better I hope they keep making them and get better as they go.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|This movie is so cute. I loved it and so did the kids. I totally recommend this as a family movie night
B009738XXM|3.0|Only one hit - Call Me Maybe, rest of CD songs just average. Buy the single only for best deal.
B009RI4FRU|3.0|Its a quirky, sort of funy, odbal litle movie that you realy want to be beter than it is. if you really like stuff like &#34;the Full Monty&#34; or &#34;A Fish Called Wanda&#34; then maybe you wont quite be as disapointed as i was. bil muray just walks through his scenes as if he was stil playing the fake zombie in &#34;Zombieland&#34; and the rest of the cast is just too confusing to kep up with.
B001UHOWW4|5.0|I went through nearly 40 years of life before seeing this film for the first time - what a mistake!  I'd been brainwashed into thinking it was a lightweight romantic comedy about a flighty yet fashionable girl who likes fancy clothes and jewelry - not really my cup of tea.  But that does not describe this film at all - in fact it has a dark and gritty subtext to it even if you haven't read the book (and I haven't). Holly Golightly is a naive small-town southern girl who's abandoned her family and is pretending to be a New York socialite - and while she's not specifically called a prostitute in the film, it's definitely implied (what else could \\"I get paid $50 to go to the powder room\\" mean?). She initially identifies with her upstairs neighbor because he's a gigolo (also implied but never outright spoken) - a profession she makes clear she \\"understands\\". This actually forms the basis of their relationship, because both clearly know they share a common secret. I don't know if audiences in 1961 picked up on these cues but I'll bet they did - to me, it's pretty obvious.<br /><br />Audrey Hepburn's charm brings a depth to a character that would seem crass and manipulative in the hands of a lesser actress, and when her naivete eventually gets her in legal trouble and her various plans for tricking wealthy johns into marrying her fall apart, we still root for her to finally find happiness.  That's the magic of Audrey in this film and many others.<br /><br />What struck me about this film when I first saw it was how much it reminded me of people I knew in New York in the 1990's (true, I did hang around with a certain crowd).  It's a timeless film - there are people and stories like this out there, even now.  I actually found it very realistic.<br /><br />Lots of people have talked about the casting of Mickey Rooney as the Japanese landlord and I don't disagree that this was a mistake (Blake Edwards doesn't either, which he explains in the special features), but it's the one blemish on a film that otherwise holds up just as well today as 50 years ago.  You do have to look at certain things in a historical context.  There is one documentary segment in the special features devoted to this, so nobody involved with this disc has tried to ignore this aspect of the film.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray transfer is the best I've personally seen this film look - which admittedly isn't too many times, but I can't imagine it looked much better in 1961.  It really looks like it might have been filmed last year, almost like a period piece set in 1960 rather than a film actually shot in 1960.  It doesn't have that \\"old film\\" look that so obviously dates other classics from that era as the source material has aged before it could be restored or preserved.  It's beautiful on this disc, perfectly color balanced and clean and sharp enough to easily see the soft focus filters used on Hepburn's closeups, the imperfections in the optical film effects (fades, composites), or changes in the film grain depending on the scene (as you'd expect with different film stocks).  There doesn't seem to be a lot of noise reduction in this transfer - just an attempt to get the film to look like it would have when it was first released.<br /><br />There are quite a few special features as well, although unfortunately none with Audrey Hepburn or George Peppard, not even an old interview they might have done about the film, or any promotional appearances from 1960 (or maybe they never did any?  Seems unlikely).  The closest we get is a featurette on Hepburn as a style icon that includes some nice photos.<br /><br />Still, that's like complaining about getting an ice cream sundae complete with five scoops of ice cream (all different flavors), hot fudge sauce *and* caramel, whipped cream and nuts on top... but there's no cherry!  What's here is more than enough to justify a purchase.
0060531053|5.0|I am very new to brewing, as I only have 4 recipe kits under my belt. I read this book before venturing on my first brew at the advice of more schooled brewers. It was the best suggestion they could have made.<br /><br />This book covers the fundamentals so well. You learn in basic terms and science the adventure you're about to embark upon. The text is easy to read and informative without being too intimidating. Questions are answered and although not the most in depth, you as a brewer learn the best lesson of all - Relax, Don't Worry, Have a Home Brew.<br /><br />If you are one to wants to know why and how without being inundated with too many complications at the start, I highly recommend this book. It's the best primer a homebrewer could want. You will gain a bit of confidence because you know what to expect to a degree. Sure beats the heck outta Internet forums for solid advice.<br /><br />All in all, invest in this book if you are new to brewing. There are other books that may cover a bit more advanced topics, but learn the basics with this gem and you'll carry it forward.
B000QRIGJY|3.0|This was a good read. Shorter than the usual Connelly stuff with all action completed in 12 hours. One major plot twist but otherwise too conveniently Bosched.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app!  It is so easy to follow a Bible reading plan or simply read through a book.  The ease of comparing translations is also immensely helpful in study.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
1416550550|4.0|It's quite long, and reading it in bits and pieces has made me lose some of the thread of the story, but I am enjoying it just the same.
B0043XQ932|5.0|This album is over the top with fluff and unholy lace. If you're looking for something to set the mood for your next Dungeons and Dragons Ravenloft campaign, or you're just level grinding away while playing World of Warcraft and you need something epic to set the mood, this is your album. It's a fantastic display of fusing orchestration and metal. A beautiful album.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is one of those stories we all would like to read about WWII. Both main characters represent the values and morals we expect in all fighting men on either side. They both did the job that was expected of them. When the two met, the German saw the futility of further deaths for his country’s lost cause and his sense of humanity took over. He risked treason and his own death to save his enemies. If you like the good tales of war, this one is for you.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Such  a great book<br />Way better than the movie<br />The review is making me write more words for the word count
B005LAIIQC|5.0|Arrived on time. Love this movie, have all the series. Enjoy watching them all together from time to time. Looking forward to the next one. Thanks
B004RJMUJO|4.0|A simple game about slashing fruit.  The kids like it.  It keeps them entertained in the car and is an easy way to chill at home.
0240815807|3.0|You may have to read this more than once to get all the info, but this guy has the cred, and the experience.<br />I don't have all the expensive gear, but this book definitely helped me use what I have to its fullest.<br /><br />Major points are discussed in detail without losing the reader in technical minutia and useless jargon. There is a summary at the end of each chapter to pound home the details, and the author cites other PRO sound engineers with examples of their work and the techniques used.<br />If you have the extra jing to add this book to your collection, do it!<br />There's alot of useful info here, including miking, EQing, monitoring and comping techniques that are overlooked by alot of home recordists.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|I got hooked with this show since the very beginning. I think the plot is smart and powerful and Damian Lewis is superb. Everything about this show is right. The only reason why I did not give the show 5 stars is because I think in the last episodes Claire Danes is somehow overacting. For some reason I can't figure out yet, I don't see her as a CIA agent.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun fun fun awesome when bored and nothing to do .. at work and nothing to do play and collect money. and open new games to play
6304078102|4.0|Given as a gift and the recipient enjoyed it very much.  Good quality production for a VHS tape and price.
0761171703|4.0|I love the book and the fantastic photos ( I bought this as a gift for a dancer).  However, the photos are so small they are difficult to see and fully appreciate.  I would recommend looking at a hardcover or larger version.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Really good movie that keeps you thinking. A couple disturbing parts that were unexpected but still a great film. Watch it!
B009XTF8JM|5.0|Seen this film in theatre's and was so pleasently surprised!  The best movie of its kind since \\"The Exorcist\\"!  Very good plot, great acting, especially on the part of the young girls, and most importantly...scary!  The possessed little girl is off the hook freaky!  One of the best films of 2012.  Watch it with the lights out and you will be scared.
1607066017|4.0|If you've read a Brian K. Vaughan book before, pick this up. If you've not, pick this up. It's got all the narrative staples of a Vaughan book (snappy dialogue, brisk pacing, great characters), but ventures into the weird sci-fi realm. I mean weird.  But Vaughan manages to ground his fantastical world in reality. The stakes and consequences are real. Fiona Staples is a fine artist. Her line work is solid, if a bit too minimalist for my liking. I look forward to seeing her style grow with the series. As a Y: The Last Man fanatic, I had high expectations for this. If the first volume is any indication, Saga may be just as great if not greater.
B001LMAK88|5.0|Silverado<br />My hubby ask for this and was surprised to have it at Christmas.  It is one of his favorite movies.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fun. Addictive. In the vein of Temple Run. My 6 and 11 yo niece and nephew downloaded it and I couldn't stop playing the first two days. It's good how the developers try to break up the monotony of repeated visuals with daily challenges and missions.
B0004Z33F0|5.0|Rambo III<br />Sylvester Stallone<br />Great movie by a great Actor.  Love all his movies and can't wait for more.<br />Highly recomend.
034580404X|5.0|Got for my boyfriend and he has not put down yet, says the writing is great and he will read all three. Recommend for your significant other.
B002ZG999U|5.0|The Expendables<br />What a great movie.  If you have not seen the second one you should see it.  Just as good and an all star team at that.<br />Loved it!
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|The game overall is fairly fun if you're starting from scratch.  Unfortunately, if you're already at level 40 (the current max for the game) and have been playing on an iOS device, there is no way to transfer your progress and you have to start over.  This isn't anything I'm interested in doing since I've got most of the epic/legendary dragons already.
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|This movie had so many plot holes and the story was going absolutely no where.... not worth even a rental
B0094WK9GU|4.0|As with many others, the feel good song of \\"One\\" by Swedish House Mafia was my musical introduction to this  group.  There is a fun musical mashup of \\"You Got The Love\\" by Florence +The Machine and \\"One\\" in this collection.  The following are among some of the multiple and exciting hits on \\"Until Now\\": \\"In My Mind\\" by Ivan Gough&Feenixpawl featuring Georgi Kay, \\"Calling\\" by Sebastian Ingrosso &Alessso featuring Ryan Tedder, \\"Antidote\\" by Swedish House Mafia vs. Knife Party, \\"Resurrection and Paradise mashup\\" by Michael Calfan and Coldplay, \\"The Wave\\" by MiIke Snow,  mashup of \\"Ladi Dadi\\" by Steve Aoki &Wynter Gordon/ \\"Sing 2 Me\\" by Tomas Gold/ \\"Alright\\" by Red Carpet plus other good songs available in this deluxe collection.  \\"Until Now\\" by Swedish House Mafia is good for those who like electronica and/or dance collections.
B000FC10WU|4.0|This is my first Agatha Christie novel. it is an easy read. I was not very sure &#34;whodunit&#34; until near the end, which intrigues me. I just don't know if I didn't solve it because the book was so well written or just not enough info was given to solve it until the end. I may have to read another to find out.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I read this book after not sure if I wanted to after the first book that was hard emotionally for me to read. I am glad I continued on. This was a good book. Looking forward to the third book.
B006LSZECO|2.0|My expectations were high after reading reviews, talking to friends and watching tv commentary. The truth is, for me, the story didn't pull me in. I can see why it might, but i just didn't find either character compelling enough.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Took a chance on this omnibus having never read any reviews and not really even knowing what the story was about.  Truly a fascinating read.  Keeps the reader wanting more as the story gradually opens up more and more of the life and history of the silos.  A peek into the creators of the silos and their past would be an intriguing tale for further exploration.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Never thought I would enjoy but gave it a shot --- soooo in love with the show ... Can't wait for Season 3
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|This book is long but worth reading every word, its the type of book that has you wishing you could read faster.
B008Y1YFNU|5.0|The selection of music was great. They always meet my expectations. Anybody that liked Papa Roach will like this CD.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|This show is a definitely different from the many horror shows out there.<br />Not your typical ghost story.<br /><br />Strange and disturbing occurences in the mansion make the house filled with ghosts.<br />Explore the ghosts' lives and find out about their pasts at the same time getting<br />to know some of the mortal residents that inhabit the house... and how the lives of the ghosts cross with the lives of the humans.<br /><br />AHS also involves forbidden love and sexual relationships with ghosts and humans.<br /><br />Spooky, creepy, and worth watching.<br /><br />Great acting from Jessica Lange, Evan Peters, and Taissa Farmiga.<br /><br />Also has a lot of cool songs/music in the show.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a bit of a different take on the classic reluctant of convenience couple. The romance was complicated but strong from the very beginning and an entertaining ride. A well-written, interesting story.
0061537969|4.0|Very cute story, parts of it were laugh-out-loud funny.  I felt the characters were a little shallow, which is probably a good thing.  Wasn't so emotionally invested in them that I was too broken up about their story.
B008KPIN9C|5.0|I've never heard of this band before but I listened to this album on Amazon. I love this album. It is surprisingly grungy.
1451627297|2.0|I haven't read a King novel in twenty years or more, though he was my favorite writer when I was a young teen.  As I got older and became more exposed to real brutality and horror in our world, I got more and more sensitive to reading fictionalized stories that contain graphic violence and disturbing scenes.  I have run out of things to read and saw the great reviews and thought, what the heck, I'll give it a shot.  Maybe I've just outgrown King, but I found this book to be very formulaic, predictable, well-crafted but not great.  I didn't like the protagonist's narrative voice.  I don't ever want to hear the word \\"obdurate\\" (the reference to the past as \\"obdurate\\" is made 25 plus times, and reference to the past \\"harmonizing with itself\\" was made as many times or more).  Toward the end I started wondering if it was really King who wrote this novel, or the writer who wrote \\"Shades of Gray\\".  Only this wasn't porn, it was just overuse of the same words, over and over and over again.  And the word \\"obdurate\\" is not a word that you hear in everyday language, so its overuse jumps out at you throughout the novel, I also thought the book started really dragging halfway through.  The last several chapters were painful to read.  There was the \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" scene toward the end when the protagonist runs through the town (only the town is different, because of changes made to the obdurate past).  There was the predictable ending, better when Ray Bradbury did it.  This will be my last attempt to read a King novel.  Not gory or graphic, just plain bad.
034580404X|5.0|If your a woman read this trilogy, its exciting, interesting, and edgy fun!!  I read all three in about three weeks!
B003PIUBZS|1.0|We loved Rome. This is like a cheap knockoff: bad acting, lack of substantial plot. Focus seems to be much more on blood and nudity. It honestly feels like you are watching a move in video-game format. We basically laughed at how ridiculous it was throughout the first episode. I plan to donate it without watching the rest.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I gave ed this book 5 stars because it was an excellent book. It was a rollercoaster of emotions. It has everything a book should have.
B003MXIS8S|4.0|My 15 yr old, despite my objections roped me into this movie. Glad she did! Great suspense movie, not at all predictable.<br />Basically a movie about time travel. If your looking for a movie that doesn't feel as you've wasted you time when your finished- Dont miss this one!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The story is basically about a sexual relationship. A man who buys everything for the girl & wants her to be a submissive. (Although she chooses not to...)<br /><br />If all the sex was removed, it would be a five minute read... The overall story sucks, but because of the sexual fantasy, it's not a bad read
B0076DELIG|5.0|all i can say is i liked it enough to finish it the day i got it..harry is my all time favorite detective. i wish that Michael Connelly hadn't aged harry so fast.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I found myself sucked in right from the beginning. Well written and heart wrenching with an HEA. I find Colleen Hoover to be one to really put a lot of thought into details and no inconsistencies. I loved her other books as well :)
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Daughter got this for Christmas, she loves these types of movies so couldn't go wrong with what she wanted. You either like these kind of movies or you don't.  Great condition.  Speedy delivery from seller.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|Really enjoyed this one.  The free version has terribly intrusive ads, and it was well worth the 99 cents to get rid of them.  Buy it, enjoy it, and thank me later.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this is my top pick!!!!!!!!!!!! I play it all day good on kindle fire good on anything I think its grate if you like to think stagory
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|The movie would have been just as good if they had left out the cuss words.  Other than that, the movie was ok.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great story, allover the hidden object sciences. Although dark at some points the ending really helps tie up any questions one has.
B00899F0G8|5.0|This is a great show....I would encourage everyone to watch it. Its a great scare and keeps you guessing. Right when you think you have something figured out,  another curve ball is thrown.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|This is a good calculator. I use it every time I need one. The graphics are good and I haven't had a problem with it so far. I recommend.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I rated this book at a 5 star rating because it's a good book and a life lesson, and also I would recommend this book to kids 8-17
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Hey I just have one question for you guys out there WHY the neck is the video camera not working I mean seriously I tried like 20 times and nothing happened except for the fact that a box popped up and said that the video thing wasn't working
B0007KLH1Y|5.0|My 5 kids all loved playing with Kapla so I bought a set for my sister's kids too.  Some reviews express disappointment over the blocks' &#34;not making anything&#34; or the kids not seeing the point.  On the contrary, we appreciate the room for creativity. A lot of the time our kids would simply build different, wacky towers just for the pleasure of seeing how high they could make them and then demolishing them!
B00APUQRPC|2.0|Without closed captioning I missed parts of the dialogue and lost track of the plot and story and relationships beatween characters.
B008QDCZJ2|2.0|Only a few of the songs, like Leaving and Winner, are typical PSB.  Looks like the boys mailed this one in.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book! It's a wonderful sequel to The Hunger Games...Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down; it's a real page turner. Suzanne Collins did a beautiful job; I could actually see what Katniss saw,feel what she felt. I can't wait to see the movie!
B0053O89KG|5.0|Friends first told me about the Castle series three years ago.  After one episode I was hooked.  Although I do record every episode I find I want to have the additional information (writers comments, take out scenes etc.) that I can get in having the complete seasons. I have all four.  I find I want to go back and review past shows, just as I re-read favorite books.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is so fun and better then temple run because you don't have to tilt. This is my favorite game on my kindle fire hd. Well I guess that is it. Bye
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|I played through Tesla's Electric Mist fairly quickly.  I enjoyed the plot despite that fact that it did not have any twists.  This is a straightforward mission, not a mystery.  The scenes are well done, and I found the puzzles fun and challenging.  The animations and sound effects lagged quite a bit on my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1, but everything still worked.  A few points during the game, I got lost and needed to use a hint.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Excellent book! My favorite from Nicholas Sparks so far! I definitely recommend reading it. The only thing that I wish was different is that the story was carried on a little longer!!! :)
B0071BGOJC|4.0|Esta habla de los hijos de los personajes de La caída de los Gigantes.  La trama está en Rusia, Inglaterra, Alemania y USA.  Cualquier libro de Ken Follet es muy bueno, esperemos el siguiente... que supongo que hablará de la 2da mitad del siglo XX
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book. Keeps you wanting more. Cant wait to see how Katniss kicks the capitols ass. Ready for book 3 :)
B0040UEI7W|5.0|I'd forgotten how good this Meistersinger was.  The singing is excellent (Donath could hardly be bettered!) and Karajan was still a good conductor when it was recorded.  Highly recommended.
B009IF8CH6|4.0|The show is amazing...one of the best series ever. problem is the downloaging seems slow. Still, I recommend purchasing it...don't miss an episode
B009MCRHH6|4.0|This game is highly addictive. It presented quite a challenge to me. My 24 year old son had to help me with it. Great game for people who love a challenge. It was easy for my son who is an engineer and a video game enthusiastit..
1419701533|5.0|All the books are really nice quality. My 7 1/2 year old loves them all. Super entertaining and easy for her to read. I'm even enjoying reading them at bedtime to her. Great set and great value!
B008I43DYU|4.0|very easy to use this calculator, highly recommend it! good app to have for handy use, nice to have right at your fingertips
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|I really liked some of the songs on this album, but was disappointed when I realized it just included some of the songs from the movie. Luckily it has most of the ones I wanted. I would've definitely paid a bit more to have the rest of the album. However if they release a full album later with the rest of the songs I don't think I'll buy it since it really should've all been included from the beginning.
B003IEJZUG|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It was a page turner from start to finish. I couldn't  put it down.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is an awesome calculator for the kindle fire. I tried a number of other calculators,but got tired of putting up with small buttons that were easy to miss-press. The kindle has a nice large screen, why not use it all? This app does. It gives a nicely-styled, full-screen calculator with big buttons and large numbers. Perfect. It remembers what you have done and shows operation history in a clear format. Note to developers: love the new professionally-styled icon - so much easier to locate in my favorites.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read this in just a few days even with work. I couldn't put it down....lots of twists and oh my gosh moments. Will be interesting to see the movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I bought this late at night/early hours in the morning.. and I did not stop reading until I finished at 8am. This messed up my sleeping schedule but it was so worth it. The story is not predictable at all.. you think you know what's going on but then you don't. It's definitely not the generic romance, but so so so so much better. The characters are so realistically created, their actions so meaningful. I smiled and laughed, but also gasped and winced. Nothing was overdone, nothing underdone. All together, it was so beautiful. I need to read it again.<br /><br />The only negative thing I have to say about this book is that it was so good, it ruined me for all the other books I will read in the near future. It'll be hard to find any book that can top this one.
0486268659|3.0|I used this book as an ancillary text for my CAHSEE (California High School Exit Exam) class. Even though it presented some difficulties, comprehension and vocabulary issues, the students felt very proud that they could read this classic and know the story along with so many others. Most of the class had never heard of The Christmas Carol, so I was excited to share it with them. I used study materials along with the novelette, and then showed the Jim Carrey version to help them visualize the events, etc.. It is a classic for a reason, and I never fail to get new insight to the tale as well as the Dicken's characters.<br />The only suggestion I would make would be to add illustrations. That's the only reason for the &#34;okay&#34; rating.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was really good. Full of surprises and  different from any other story. I would and  did recommend it to my reader  friends.
1568363931|5.0|THis book is a well bound the colors and the formatting in it is top notch and really appetizing.  I was surprised in a good way that they had all kinds of asian takes on other cultures foods in a bento format.  -- I have only used on recipe and it was great.  In short if you want  a book with really beautiful pictures that helps to teach yourself how to make good easy and elegant meals in a bento box format. You will not be disappointed.  -- now how useful it is in terms over all instructional efficacy  I cannot yet make an informed comment.  But from what I can tell it looks nice.  And more importantly it is what it appears a really nice physical book with really beautiful photos of really appetizing food and the picture food is what you have recipes for.  and there seems to be far more than just the recipe information.  So this book is at worst a very truthfully represented  product that was delivered promptly and is of high quality paper and binding.  if you want to see if you like how the instructions are,  use the look inside feature.  For me,  So far so Awesome.  And I might note I am a food dunce,  I like books that spell out how to do even the most simple procedure with detail because great tasting food is as much how you do it as much as it is if you have the recipe right.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I really enjoyed this.  It is hard to believe that he is gone, but I thought he was so creative. He knew what he expected out of the band members. I was impressed...
0316227706|5.0|Absolutely loved it! The author did a wonderful job on this work of art. I would recommend this to any dog lover. This book won't disappoint!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very fun game to play. My brother, (3 years old) absolutely loves this game. Its easy enought for him to play, but still fun for me (14 years old.) WAY better than other games!&lt;3
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|First, I think you should be able to rename the character in the story. It makes no sense to put your name in for the game to only refer to you as Irene. Secondly, during many of the quests, items are hidden behind the status bar. How am I supposed to find them if I literally cannot see them? And the lists of items to find, I should be able to search the whole list. I've found myself with 5 items left to find and only able to see 1 on the list.... Really?<br /><br />I really enjoy games like this to help pass the time, but developers, PLEASE address these issues. As the game progresses, the things I've mentioned make the gAme almost unplayable.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Like most games that are similar, money has to be spent in order to excel quickly.  The game gives goals early on that require money to buy a certain currency. Other than that, it's pretty entertaining
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read all the books in the Mith Rapp series.  My favorite is Term Limits.  I will admit the last two books in the series didn't hold my interest as much as the earlier books in the series.  The Last Man caught and held my attention like Term Limits.  The story did not disappoint with twists and turns in every chapter.  I found myself laughing out loud in some spots--a sign of a good read, in my opinion!<br /><br />The ending of this book left me looking forward to what Mr. Flynn has in store for Mitch Rapp, Irene Kennedy, Stan Hurley and the rest!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Love this game  If you play the right option you have to pay attention to the story line.  I play many HO games as they are my favorite past  time games and this is one ofmy favorites.  The graphics are very good and the mini games are reasonably easy . I would recommend it.  Many complain that free is not really free but I think we all expect to pay more for the full version.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Super cool! But needs a little more level design. Either way it is an app worth the dollar. As great as cut the rope!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I enjoyed this book totally.  The author wanted to share his story with others and you could feel the urgency that he wanted to do this.  Very well written although some of it could be confusing to someone without a medical background.
0679809015|5.0|Very small (perfect for toddler hands) good book for the diaper bag. In modern parlance, the print equivalent of peek-a-boo barn. My daughter (14 month) loved it on the plane and while we are out.
0316776963|5.0|I loved this book. I laughed out loud a lot. My family looked at me funny each time. This is definitely a book to read. I can't wait to read another one of his books.
141694737X|5.0|Good sized flaps for toddler hands (my daughter is 14 months) with a simple narrative story. This quickly became her favorite book!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|mainly just a collection of mini games. not bad not super great either. It is nice app if you wanna kill a couple of minutes.
B00457WZEI|5.0|Loved it,  it's our first e-book we have tried.  For elderly or young people being able to read with large print and bright pages makes reading a greater pleasure.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|this product is so much fun. My boyfriend works out with the Nike game and it saves him money on a gym member ship.
B007THA4FI|5.0|This is not anything like Harry potter.  I enjoyed this story very much.  While it got a little confusing at times as a whole it kept my attention and interest.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Excellent reworking of Holmes and Watson.  Fun, serious and creative.  Lucy Lu is the best!  I stumbled onto this show and love it.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I was very surprised in this game if you like a good suspenseful hiding type game then you should check this one out .
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|These 3 books are the the best books ever.I stay up for hours because I cant stop thinking about it.I am like âOMG I cant belive that they had children!!â.I am a Hunger Games freak.Just thinking about it I start jumping up and down.I have to bit my cheak!
B00011KHTM|4.0|Great product and quality. Much cheaper on the wallet buying from these guys and the quality looks the same as the product on the Apple store shell.
B0085Z8F4A|1.0|This is a review of the DISCS (not the movie).... I got the 4 disc set at Best Buy at the same price as Amazon here, but posting this to help some 3D Blu Ray users from suffering what many others have suffered from some weirdness about how the discs are made. Check this thread before you buy. [...]<br />---<br />Please count me in with those frustrated by the weirdness that is most definitely attributable to Prometheus.<br /><br />I have a Sharp AQUOS 80\\" 3D Quattron TV with their media player blu ray player. I have not had any disc not play. A few weeks ago I took Prometheus 2D Blu Ray from the library, and try as I would, it did not play. All other Blu Rays played fine. I took it back.<br /><br />I rarely buy movies on disc as they only get used once as far as I am concerned. But, before Christmas I bought from Best Buy the 4-disc set. I finally opened it tonight.<br /><br />I checked for updates and my SHARP player is fully updated. But, the  fact that this movie from a sealed new package did not play from my new 3D disc... BOTH discs actually hang the Blu Ray player and the only way to shut it down is to hold the Power button until RESET appears.... as well as the thread linked above show that the problem is widespread. Maybe that is why they are selling a 4-disc set for $19.99.<br /><br />I will now have to dig the receipt to return the movie if they will even take it after so many days.<br /><br />Very disappointed and annoyed at the makers of this set of discs.<br /><br />Imran
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. You should read it too! It is full of adventure , laughs ,  and amazing places.
B000PKX2KA|4.0|I bought this to work with my GRLevel3 software. I have not been able to make it work with the software. I have had it light up and recieve positioning data, so it clearly works, just not the way I was hoping. I will update my review if I get it working as I am sure that others will also be looking for something similar.  Update... (And I should have posted this a while ago). But it works well. It took some tweaking, but I got it working. I have also since made the transition to Mac and it works well for Mac as well.
0061124958|5.0|I'm 53 and had never read it before.  I bought it because my 1 yr old granddaughter said &#34;Hi Ya!&#34; to a spider.  I was delighted that the book introduced the new word &#34;salutations&#34; when saying hello to Charlotte.  Also a good story for my 5 yr old granddaughter who has had to deal with the death of 2 pets and a beloved great grandpa.
B00371QQ0M|4.0|While not the audiophile showcase disc, this was a lot of fun. I saw this in the theater when it first came out. I have seen this movie far too many times on VHS, and DVD. I have gotten used to the soft images over the years. If you are a fan of Dune, you know what you are in for, and why you are watching it. For you... this will be a fun ride. For the less initiated... Well I have nothing for you. If you like comming of the messaiah type science fiction movies where giant worms might eat you and people run around blowing up things with words... well you will probably like it.<br />If you are a fan of David Lynch, you will probably like it.<br />If you are expecting superb visual quality or want a movie that you do not have to think about and need things spoon fed to you... pass on this one.<br />It is fantastic for a movie from the 80's. I enjoyed the 1080 vision of this thing. There was so much detail I did not know was there (thank you standard def). So it was like cleaning my glasses and seeing all this wonderful stuff that was there all along.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The ending just dropped.  I was expecting more from John Grisham.  I'll still go and buy a new Grisham book when it comes out though!
B005LAII62|4.0|Enjoyed this movie very much, very well made, entertaining & fun. Only one drawback - I think the movie is inappropriate for children under 10, due to violence.
1609611543|5.0|the eating plan may be challenging, although my son is doing it with few problems.<br />the theory makes total sense.<br />thanks<br />mj
B009186JYI|1.0|I have HD dvd player and this dvd audio is not supported by HDMI audio output. waste of. money! do not buy
1594135851|5.0|although the hunger games series is a bit hard for a grandma to wrap her mind around, I read it because my granddaughter just loved it.  It was sobering, and I hope to God it isn't in our future, but it was a fast read and I'm glad to share it with her.  Another of my grands loved harry potter, but I am sorry to say, I have not read that series.<br />Just trying to keep up.<br />gram
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Yes, it is a bit repetitious, but the author is just letting us know what she has to go through every morning she wakes up.  The ending in not predictable, and there is a twist which you will not see coming.  This book stuck with me for two days.  Now, I am searching for something with the same punch.  I've decided to try Birdman, by Mo Hayder.
1444737112|5.0|I am still reading this book. It is an easy read and it would be appropriate for kids maybe 12+ years of age. Cat lovers will enjoy this for sure.
B008MC175A|5.0|i purchased this as a gift and the recipient loved it!  I bought it as a deal of the day so it was a great price, too!
B004DM0UII|5.0|I've only been using this for a couple of days but love the UI and the selection of stations. I also use Tunein Radio Pro. There's some overlap of features between the two but the differences make each app unique. The UI is really what makes this app standout for me but I would really like to see a recording function and the ability to see local stations. Maybe I'm overlooking some features since I'm still learning my way around. Overall an excellent app.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|I love this!  I purchasedd this as a gift because I already owned it.  The movie is just as wonderful as the first movie and the show.  I'm a SATC junkie!
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I just wish the book was  little more straightforward, so I could understand it better. I never would have guessed what aunt Helen did to Charlie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Cooleen Hoover has done it again .... what an amazing book.<br />This book made it to my top 5 for 2012<br />A must read.
B009ANP4F4|4.0|There have been no issues with the movie.  I was shipped what I requested and within a good time :)  The only thing that I wish I knew before I purchased is that it says &#34;rental only&#34; on the front of the movie.  It's not a big issue, I just wish I would have known because it was a birthday gift.  The movie looks and plays well though.
B006C67NP6|5.0|The useful aspects are 1) many songs that can be downloaded easily from the forum 2) wide range of tempos 3) ability to cut out an instrument 4) change keys, 5) change style of backing (med. swing, bossa or whatever) and many more.<br /><br />The teaching mode is very useful.  It can be programmed to increase the tempo by a specified amount every chorus.  It can also be programmed to change the key by a specified interval every chorus.  I personally like the tempo feature for practicing a head starting off slowly and speeding up.<br /><br />One problem is that if you want to learn the head of the tune, you need to have the music from somewhere else.  I can't think of any way for iReal b to solve this problem.  Another small nit is that there is no Windows version.  I bought an android tablet for the purpose of using iReal b.  If there was a Windows version I would have used my laptop.  The advantage of the tablet I bought (Samsung Galaxy 2 tab 7&#34;) is that it is easy to carry around.  And I can just put it on the music stand.<br /><br />I have only been using it for a couple of days.  There are many features I have yet to discover and utilize.  I don't think you will be disappointed.
B004ZWKWQQ|4.0|Got this for my dad's 54th birthday. He's been working on it in his spare time for a few weeks. It's quite the project, but he seems to be enjoying himself. It's nice, but I couldn't believe that it cost $95. Wow.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I absolutely LOVE this game. it only has one problem. I haven't played it in a long time and it told me I haven't bought stuff I already had! this made me extremely annoyed. other than this I love it and reccomend it!
B000JPRPAO|5.0|I've watched it a half dozen times - and will probably watch it at least a half dozen more.  along with Mark Walberg's Shooter, I rate this move thoroughly enjoyable, and a WELL DONE !
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is addictive. if you need 3 to 5 minutes just to veg out, collect coins and high five nerds, this'll do the job.
B007SGM084|3.0|alot of hype regarding the S&M. a love story between a weak woman and a controlling man. did not bother to finish book 2 let alone start book 3.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|forgot to download it, looks good though a a a a a a a a a a aa  a a
B002RKSZN0|5.0|The first time I read Mansfield Park it was mostly for the sake of completing the Austen canon, but as time goes by the novel has grown on me, not so much for the plot as for its favorable view of and appreciation for simplicity and country life.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I like how they adapted the AB game for SW. Gave each bird a new look and new powers, which freshen up the game.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Enjoyed this book a lot.  Intricate plot , a little hard to follow at first.  Would definitely recommend it for a light, interesting read.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|An enjoyable homage to Starship Troopers. Seems strangely dated in some ways, such as its treatment of homosexuality. The focus is definitely on the realities of war and not the fabulous technology of the Colonial Union.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Watching Elf is an annual Christmas Day for our family.  We love it!  Magic, love and laughter, it's exactly what we want for Christmas.
B000FC12SM|4.0|this book is a good reminder of the differences between men and women. while i did not find a lot of the examples that way I think as a women. I have run into ladies I work with that use indirect communication. It was a good reminder in how to improve my communication with them and it was helpful in conversations with my partner...ie understand how he thinks. i would say even if you are not the typical person in this book, you can still learn good tips from it
0375413405|5.0|Actually I gave this to my son and daughter in law as a gift as they had talked about wanting it.<br />My daughter in law will enjoy reading and trying new recipes although they are difficult.<br />The fact that it is the 50th year for this book is amazing!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Came on time, great price!  A good box set for a Christmas gift, and my husband loved it very much!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Started looking for a replacement for my old Logitech G9 mouse i purchased a few years ago.  It was disconnecting and reconnecting indicating a frayed wire.  So i began looking at gaming mouses and seeing what advacements have been made in the last few years.<br />I noticed this beauty.  Has the DPI/inner guts of a 90$ mouse at a 30$ price level.  As the other reviewers have mentioned, the mouse wheel might be a bit better but everything else about it is great.<br />Buttons galore! 3 buttons on the thumb rest, a bunch splattered in the middle.<br />Accurate.  Took a little bit getting used to it, but it's great.<br />The lights and the software are a bit of a fad, but it is something that'e extra which imo makes it a 5/5 star item.<br />We'll see how long it lasts, but it will probably be a few years until i bother looking for a replacement.  At the price point i may just buy another.
B00493E1GI|1.0|I never got it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />I bought and paid for it but you never even Mailed it to me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Please send me something so I know you got this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007N85ZXY|1.0|I've been a HUGE fan of Neil Young's since the mid-seventies and had HIGH hopes his latest release would be terrific. BIG MISTAKE...I loathed this CD. Not one cut was worth listening to...all the songs were discordant and off-key. The entire CD was off-putting. DO NOT WASTE your money purchasing this tract of &#34;music&#34; (???).  VERY disappointing....
B001NKI60W|5.0|I've watched this movie about five times and each time it makes me laugh and makes me want to get up and dance and sing.  I watched it this time with a friend who needed to be uplifted and it worked its magic on her too.
B007U1FEJE|1.0|I've been a HUGE fan of the Beach Boys since the mid-sixties and had high hopes this new release would be terrific. BIG MISTAKE...I loathed every single cut. The music was off and the singing was terrible.  DO NOT waste your money purchasing this CD. I will never buy another new anything new from them again. Disappointing...
B009PJXY3M|5.0|Bought this for my daughter. Bridget absolutely nailed the songs on this album. She loves all the songs on this album. Great hits!
B0012CCNUU|3.0|I love The Traveling Willburys for the most part but did not like some of the songs. I would rather have had a shorter album with most of thier music that I do like. This is the first time I have purchased music from Amazon and will continue to do so.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|One word: AMAZING. I love this series so so much!!! Rick Riordan talent is limitless and extraordinary!!!! Percy Jackson forever!!
B003QF8E4A|5.0|I really liked this film. I read the book and the movie came very close to what occured in the book. If I hadn't read it first, I would have been very frightened .
B0086700CM|4.0|I love this game but did they take out the blue and red coins and energy refillers? because a girl like me needs 5 star quality!
B008BM9L72|3.0|Read it because of all the hype.  Read it and found it a pretty ok read.  I found it both intriguing and a little disturbing.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|A great and handy app for my Kindle. Very easy to check on battery life. Love when it actually tells you the % of battery life remaining. Again, a super and practical app.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Really good amazing but it ended to fast I was just reading ready to start the next chapter not the next book but I guess it did ok the next book is sure to be amazing
B008I43DYU|5.0|A super tool. Very large and quite easy to read numbers. Just one small issue; I wish there was a % key on basic calculator.
B009H1S56O|5.0|Exactly what my girlfriend wanted for a Christmas present . She loved it and all of the extras that it came with
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I chose  to tea  this after a friend highly recommended it and I finished it in 3 days. It is such a powerful coming of age story that will grip any reader, regardless of age or gender. You won't be able to put it down.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|this game is a great time killer. I love to try and get the new blades and beat my high score. The game takes a few seconds to load and it haven't frozen up on me the month I have been playing it. I recommend this game to every kindle fire user, tablet user and smartphone user!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|simple nice to use :)  large numbers are great! keeps your tally of what you last calculated and..... its free. cant get better than that.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|My sister ruined my ipad one so i got it on here its less laggie and the wide screen is way better
B004I744AS|5.0|I have this app installed on my Kindle Fire--I've used it for playing Words with Friends and it works well.
B004N6369Y|5.0|Another awesome read by my favorite author. Danielle Steel. Can't w a it to see the next book and dive into it
1439127700|5.0|I bought this as a gift and will read it myself--my friend says it is well written and provides insight into the lives of those who have led our country.
B003L77GRO|5.0|I've been a fan from the beginning. I'm not sure why, but this is my favorite year. I hope it's not their peak.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I bought this app for my Kindle Fire--it works very well, is easy to use and I am happy with its features.
B004QSQMKE|4.0|Gorgeous film.  Two versions: one with the superior original score, the other with the hastily put together Tangerine Dream score for American release.  Ridley Scott discusses the genesis, screenplay(s), set design and why nervous producers insisted on a different score.
0199267170|5.0|I bought this as a gift at my brother's specific request--he thinks the Oxford edition is the best for avid Shakespeare readers.  I also bought him the companion guide with which he is thrilled.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|My kids really enjoyed this book as well as the other books written by this author. Recomended for kids 10-12.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I've read this book and I have come to be attached.i wanted to read the book before the movie,and I cannot wait for the movie
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Not only was this a fascinating story, but the book tells the story in a very readable and entertaining way.  I have quickly recommended this book to several others.  Well done!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My Mom Has An iPad and i have a  kindle fire, and we both have it on our devices. My little brother is always on this game. You get coins by runnng from Santa and by not getting hit by trains. With the coins you can get little things ( All Directioners i know what i just did) to help you with the racetrack thingamajig. I deffiinetly recommend this for people 0- 1,0000!
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|I like this type of game. good graphics and lots of different things to do lots of fun to play enjoy
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|I rented the HD version of this movie, expecting to use Unbox to download and watch it.<br /><br />No dice. Unbox couldn't find it. The amazon viewer (on the web site) won't play in HD.<br /><br />So, good movie, bad user experience.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I love Mitch Album and this is a wonderful book that makes you think about the way we view time a nd how we play beat the clock every day to try to get as much done as possible. It is a very quick read and I highly recommend it!!
0671646788|4.0|I really love this book because it helps you focus on what is most important, takes your mind off of the mundane and lifts you up to a better and brighter way of thinking.
B00009N83Y|1.0|The disk was scratched beyond use.  The aggravation to return it was not worth the effort or expense.  When you get a bad product through Amazon, you are totally out of luck.  What a dissappointment, especially as ww gave it as a gift.  It was an embarrassment to us.  Buying this way is very risky.
0060763280|4.0|If you need to change your thinking about money, and your life, this book will help, It is not saying anything different from most self-help books but it does help
1449410243|5.0|This book's hilarious! I'm a big fan of the Oatmeal website, so it's great to have the book as well.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! It completely had my attention from the beginning, right to the very end! The best love story ever!
B009329ZF2|4.0|However, there is no way that 4 men can carry a 1000 pound shell from one end of a ship to the other.  Also the shells are normally kept below deck so they would have had to carry it up several ladders (stairs).  Other wise, being a old navy hand, I liked it.
B007LB2B3K|5.0|I'm glad I bought this. My favorite song on here is Still Counting...hehe. I like the heavy rock style and the lead singer's voice.
B008K6HN8I|2.0|This app is not easy to use and unclear as to how it works or what it does -- I would not recommend this to anyone else.
B005FHXB0O|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time.  Imagine if QT directed it.... A must see. Word word word word
B002VHI8J0|5.0|One of my best books ever read! I have a lot of reality with the ideas of this book. I really recommend it!
B007V65R54|5.0|I have started to think probabilistically in my daily life, which has made me get away from the all too common &#34;You always do this&#34; &#34;You never do that.&#34;  Given what happened in the 2012 election, a rapid production of a second edition would appear to be nearly mandatory.  Many said Silver was a one time lucky predictor.  What he did in 2012 was basically nail the election PLUS show where the momentum changed, first for Romney and second for Obama.  No question he was right, when nearly everybody else was not.  The outcome in the swing states was almost completely correct, and the overall national numbers were a little off, only because momentum was changing right up to and including Election Day.  His discussion of poker was also fascinating.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|More &#34;meat&#34; to this plot that some of his later books.  I really enjoyed  htis one and could hardly put it down!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Awesome read.  Finally the Pendergast I fell in love with.  Looking forward to reading the next Pendergast story line.  Excellent!
B0076DELIG|5.0|I always enjoy Det. Harry Bosch books.  I reccomend it but it does leave a couple questions at the end.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|this game dosint work at all I buy the game it dosint go off at all I tchrit tangent it dosint work AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00846REIS|5.0|Well written and exciting. A searing love between two very emotionally wrecked  people who are trying to find their way.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I wish I had been aware of Rodriguez 40 years ago.  Better late than never. Love to listen and sing along.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book started off as a slow read but, it ended up with some  unbelievable twists! I wouldn't have ever guessed the ending.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book was very enjoyable.  It was slow at the beginning,but sped up once you got farther into it.  I still believe that the first book was faster and better, but Catching Fire was still well worth reading.
B006HL9G10|5.0|This is a great app. You have the ability to set it to tone at regular intervals, at a set time from the start, and at a set time from the end. Of course, if you'd just like to have it sound a nice bell after a set time, it can do that too. There are some great features, but they aren't in your way if you choose not to use them.<br /><br />The sound quality of the bells is the best I've heard. If you didn't know better, you would believe that someone actually struck a bowl. The sound also lingers for a long time, which I love.<br /><br />There is a social aspect too. You can see how many others are meditating with the app at the same time, send messages, and connect with friends. Again, you can ignore all these features if you aren't interested.<br /><br />If you have a timed meditation practice, you won't find a better app than this one.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Yes, I am a huge Stephen King fan, and like most of his work, but this is the best book King has written in years. At least since Duma Key.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|This is a wonderfully campy story that always entrances children of all ages.  A story that always entrances children, and brings out the children in all of us.......
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I am playing this on my Kindle Fire.  I am not a gamer.  I play a few and that's all, usually games that require strategy or mental work  such as mazes, sudoku, or Angry Birds.  At first I thought this was a game of luck, but as I play further I see that there is a lot of strategy involved.  The graphics are good, the theme rather silly, but you have to have one, I suppose.  Unfortunately, some of it is based on already being familiar with games, with no explanations, so I have yet to figure out a couple of aspects.  Nevertheless, I am enjoying it very much, more than Bejeweled 2.  I think it's a bit too expensive for a game.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|If you enjoy watching wildlife documentaries, you are in for something better than you would expect.  David Attenborough has a great voice for narration and the footage is quite wonderful.  The behind the scenes on how the shots are taken is very informative and really shows the viewer how much effort has gone into making this series.  Soothing for people who need to watch something when they go to bed.

B0081KTHEQ|4.0|I was able to sit back and enjoy this on my flight home from a business trip on my Kindall Fire.  It made the flight go by so darn fast and I really enjoyed the movie.  I did read the book first and I think it helped make the movie better as there are some parts that are a little confusing but having read the book it was much clearer.  I enjoyed seeing a grown up Harry Potter and think Daniel Radcliffe has grown into a fine actor.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Tube mate allows you to download Youtube videos on your tablet/phone. The app does exactly as expected which would be download any video/song off youtube and at good speed. I've not had too many problems other than it crashing once. I highly recommend this for budget tablets. It's a light app.
B000NQRE9Q|2.0|My son-in-law was really looking forward to viewing the Blue-Ray, but when he tried it in the player it would not load.  On further inspection, the first disc was scratched.  I don't know how to return it for an &#34;undamaged&#34; set.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Intriguing.....gripping…at the edge-of-your-seat! Although I saw the movie before reading this - I enjoyed it none the less! Can't wait to start the next!
B002KEDQJQ|5.0|If you liked the movie, seeing it again in this Blu-Ray won't disappoint. Good audio too. Always something I think tends to be a bit odd in some DVD/Blu-Rays (the audio being high in conversations, then low when music, or vice-versa, causing having to adjust the volume while watching). Not a problem in this Blu-Ray. Excellent.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I would highly recommend this book for any reader who enjoys romance along with comedy and drama. Fantastic book that I was totally hooked on.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Well written, well edited.  BUT the first page of each chapter is missing unless I go to a tiny font!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Can't wait to read the next book!! This book is definitely worth the buy & worth the read!! I only hope the movie does this book justice!
B007SGM084|4.0|This series was fun to read.  Lots of drama. I would recommend to my adult friends. Lots of interesting information as well.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It's about life, growing up and the journey of finding out who you are and recreating yourself along the way. This entire story has so many beautiful and sweet parts... the main character is relatable and loveable and at times you pity him, or want to wrap him up in your arms, into comfort him. All in all, this story is so raw and truthful to the lives of these characters who are so much like people we may actually know- this creates and infectious story you won't want to get away from. I couldn't put this book down. It keeps you wondering, asking questions about yourself and your life constantly.
B00846REIS|4.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who loved Fifty Shades. It's so descriptive and leaves you wanting more. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Sylvia Day has such a great way of describing the scenes and feelings of lust that it becomes real.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Really good. Took a few chapters to really get into it. I recommend to all readers. Happy reading :-). Thanks
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Thrilling saga- cant Wait to read the next one.  Historical fiction at its best - each of the sub stories are equally engaging- great character development
B008M721MS|5.0|Very nice app .. great for communicating with friends and family. Works well on my kindle fire hd.  Highly recommended.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I'd give it 10 stars if I could!  Great writing!  Best description of a first kiss that I have ever read! Every man should read the part on the first kiss! OMG!  This was a beautiful story about love for a child and what lengths you will go to protect them, true love, first love, forever love, real intimacy and forgiveness. It encompasses moral dilemmas and deals with sexual assault. You will laugh and cry. The characters display honesty and a sense of humor that is refreshing given the superficial world we live in. Don't pass this book up!
B005LAIHSG|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect, but I really enjoyed this movie. I thought it was going to be good, but it was even better than I had expected.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this on my kindle. If my phone is not handy I use this app. It came in handy to balance my check book.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|TBBT is one of the most intelligent comedies to come along in years. We love that there's finally a prime time sitcom for those of us who don't mind turning our brains on while we're being entertained. It's one of the few shows we'll actually pay to watch. If you haven't seen it yet, you need to!
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|I love this game but sometimes it doesn't work on my kindle fire hd. I  do say you should download the free one then get the one for money assistants what I did. Well this game rocks! Other then when I won't open up on my kindle.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Read the whole book in one sitting! Very entertaining. A very easy read and perfect for any age! Can't wait for part three!
B003ZSJ212|4.0|Love Star Wars. The only thing that I'm sad about and hoping maybe someone has some advice for me. I bought this as a gift for my husband for Christmas. He loved it!!! That's not the problem. The problem is with all this encrypting they are doing with Blu-ray discs, there are some we have not been able to play on our Blu-ray player without paying an arm and a leg every time to upgrade the software we've already paid for, to be able to watch them. Our Blu-ray player is in our computer. It makes me upset that if when we buy a movie and it's encrypted we cannot watch it. I don't understand why every time we want to play a new Blu-ray we also have to pay to upgrade the software to watch something we've already paid for?
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Design, color, material, price -- all perfect.  It's not a hard plastic, nor a soft type, it's in-between.  A front bumper can be a little lower/thinner.  I dropped my iPhone once when I got out a car, hit concrete floor, but came out safe without a scratch.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|there are no page numbers. When following the professor in class, there is no way to find a specific page. What is location 2185 when a book has 437 pages? Insane!
B001UV4XI8|4.0|I have seing all Harry Potter movies. I like this one but there is a part that it becomes very slow and almost boring. I think the problem is that the Deathly Hallow story takes at least 3 hours so they add long scenes to make more total time and make two movies.<br />It is a good movie but is not my Harry Potter favorite movie.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Kudos to the author.  I so like her work - the unusual style, the intelligent plot, and the many twists - that I immediately bought her past 2 books.  Can't wait to start reading and be thrilled again.

B0094BB4TW|2.0|this app would be perfect if the newsfeed worked, which in my opinion is the most important part. really disappointing
B006O6F932|1.0|The Monster HIgh High School Playset<br />This product is extremely flimsy!!!It was made with cheap plastic that kept falling apart.  I was very upset because it was a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. My advice to all  who think  they want to purchase a Monster High High School Playset, Don't!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this book! It makes you realize how intense emotions can be felt from young people and how to overcome such damage to where you find is the most important part of your life.
B00355L2TU|5.0|Actually felt like I did something positive for my body after I was done and the fact that it is only twenty minuets made it even better.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|Set in 1988, \\"The Sessions\\" is an extraodinary movie based on the true-life experiences of Mark O'Brien, a then-38-year-old man paralyzed by polio, who seeks to experience physical love for the first time. John Hawke plays O'Brien, a devoutly Catholic man who nevertheless seeks the physical intimacy that disease robbed from him. Helen Hunt is a sex therapist who has 6 sessions to unlock O'Brien's fettered sexuality. And Bill Macy plays the parish priest who befriends O'Brien and gives him unoffical license to fulfill his humanity.<br /><br />The film deals with the web of emotions that is unleashed by the encounters. O'Brien is gratified by the physical release he experiences, but is desperate for the human love and emotional intimacy that is normally concommitant to a sexual encouter. Helen Hunt is torn by her deep feelings for O'Brien, her professionalism and her duty to her family. And Macy struggles to leaven his role as O'Brien's priest with his role as O'Brien's friend and confidante.<br /><br />There is an awful lot of nudity and frank sexuality in the film. Kudos to Helen Hunt for baring all at age 49. A great ensemble cast in a story that will make you uncomfortable while having you root for a profoundly disabled man to find the love that all of us dream of.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is such an amazing book! Yes some parts are a little confusing but over all this is one of the best books I have ever read!!!!
B00005BJ2O|4.0|I thought the movie was ok, but loved the sound track and that is exactly what this is. Very enjoyable.
B004QX07G4|3.0|It's an okay book. Not that funny, just cute. It's not what I expected. I still love Ellen though for what she stands for and what a nice person she is. Purchased on my kindle.
B0072GPQ72|5.0|Movie - 4.5<br /><br />I think the bond between man and animal is often taken for granted these days. Just like parents bear children or people have friends, animals essentially serve the same role. They require our nurturing and care, cost us money, keep us company, and expose us to any number of emotions when they do something good or bad and especially when we gain or lose them in life. But when you break it down, the strength of that bond and the longtime results of that sustained relationship are what make the journey and experiences worthwhile. And then you have war. For whatever disagreement that couldn't be solved with diplomacy, people start fighting, things get ugly, and lots of people usually get hurt or die in the process. War Horse is the story about a young lad named Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvine) whose father one day inherits the ownership of an equally young horse, which they'd name Joey. In raising Joey to work on their farm, Albert develops a very strong bond with the trusted stallion, until WWI and other financial circumstances force his father to sell Joey for the war. With Albert swearing to enlist and someday find his loyal steed, Joey, in the meantime would embark on a very tumultuous journey with nothing but friendship and the kindness of various strangers to keep him steady along the way.<br /><br />I think it's safe to say that war (in the broadest sense of nation vs. nation) has garnered a pretty negative connotation for itself. It causes pain and suffering to soldiers and non-soldiers alike, has a tendency for creating collateral damage, and a lot of things/people get lost in the chaos. Some could argue that war is a necessary evil, but it doesn't change the fact that the sheer amount of loss can be a painful thing to endure. What I find remarkable about this particular movie, though, is that Spielberg manages to show, not only the atrocities of war, but the spiritual strength of bonding. Whether it be Albert and Joey or the various other couplings we see throughout the film, I commend him for an outstanding effort in illustrating that before, and even throughout the events of war, that the power of friendship and comradery can prevail. Some reviews will argue that this film doesn't have a main character, but it does, and it's a very interesting one at that: Joey (yes, the horse). The multiple subplots between all the couplings (both man and animal) and the overall gamut of emotions that amount from all these experiences are vital in understanding just how valuable a bond can be, with the war illustrating the obvious flip-side. But even amidst the fighting, pay special attention to the meeting between an English and German soldier towards the end, as I feel that was the most pivotal point in proving the importance of bond and friendship to our humanity. The film is a true emotional roller coaster that, really, only could've better had the war scenes been more graphic. Nonetheless, it's a wonderful story.<br /><br />Video - 5.0<br /><br />- Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />- Video resolution: 1080p<br />- Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br />- Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1<br /><br />Director Steven Spielberg and DP (director of photography) Janusz Kaminski return for, yet another, collaboration. The last, and most recent, movies of theirs that I'd seen on BD were Minority Report and War of the Worlds. Suffice it to say, various people that aren't professional reviewers or aren't as well-versed in cinematography weren't happy with the bleach bypass technique used to give both films that trademark \\"silvery shimmer.\\" With that being the case, viewers will be happy to know that the photography for War Horse is much simpler and less futuristically-stylized. The palette in this period piece is very down-to-earth with a lot of natural browns, burgundies, and other Fall colors giving it that dated, yet warm feeling. When the war hits, the look becomes considerably murkier with lots of low lighting, various blacks and grays, and yes, even one or two instances of bleach bypass. In terms of framing, though, I have to say that with the horse playing such a vital role in the story, it equates to a lot of very wide shots to accommodate him and the surrounding people, which in turn, only goes to accentuate the grandness of the atmosphere and the period itself even more (as witnessed in the big war scenes towards the end).<br /><br />In terms of the actual transfer, the movie was shot on 35mm then digitally processed at 4K resolution, which really shows in the video quality. The beginning of the film (on the farm before the war) has some amazing clarity in terms of coloring, blacks, and just the right amount of contrast that really help the audience build some empathy between Albert and Joey. The setting of the farm felt spacious enough as it was from just the camera angles alone, but the look of it (in terms of lighting, coloring, etc.) really did something for me. I've never been on a farm, personally, but through my various viewings and imaginations of it, the closeness of the people and animals on such a wide-open range is something I've always been fond of, and this particular presentation did a great job conveying that. Alternatively, when the tone of the movie changes to wartime, black levels take much more precedence giving the film a darker look, but showing razor-sharp details in the soldiers' uniforms, the dirt and mud of the earth, and the battered bodies of the men and animals in exchange. There's a little bit of intentional softness during these shots, but it's not enough for me to deny the greatness in the rest of the presentation.<br /><br />Audio - 5.0<br /><br />Languages<br />- English: DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1<br />- French: DTS-HD HR 7.1<br />- Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles<br />- English SDH, French, Spanish<br /><br />Being a relatively high-budget film, not to mention a war movie, the sound mixing should come as no surprise to people expecting a great audio presentation. First and foremost, I have to commend the sound crew for the film's subtlety. The first half of the film is pretty much a kind of family drama with lots of low-volume effects, town and farmland ambiance, and some wonderful pieces of music by the legendary John Williams. It works to the effect of helping build that bond between Albert and Joey showing their innocence, growth, and eventual departure from one another. Likewise, the second half of the film becomes expectedly more aggressive through the madness of war with soldiers scurrying around, weapons being fired, and explosions popping up all over the place. Much like the first half in its successful attempt at creating a lighter mood, the second half achieves the polar opposite effect in creating a much darker one. I think a 5.1 mix would've sufficed enough, but War Horse was nominated for both Sound Mixing and Editing, with this 7.1 track being the proof in the pudding as to why.<br /><br />Dialogue is clear and mostly discernible (if you're not that great at understanding European accents, anyway) from the center channel and has the perfect level of volume to keep you in the story. It's never too loud or soft enough to be drowned out by everything else and is actually a welcome change to one of the BDs I recently watched that had this problem (that BD being Enemy of the State, where the surrounds are WAY louder than the dialogue can match in terms of volume). The front left and right speakers do a majority of the work, but the sides do an excellent job complimenting noises off-screen such as chatter, clutter, weapons firing, etc. with great directionality and separation. I was thoroughly impressed by rear speaker activity, though, as they put a lot of emphasis into the effects and music making the mix a very enveloping experience. Then, of course, there's the bass. LFEs (low frequency effects) are what I'm actually referring to when I say the sound mix has \\"subtlety.\\" Horse galloping, thunder rumbling, and war noises have such a precise quality to them, that I absolutely recommend you listen to this movie on a good surround sound setup and prepare to have your room shake. My favorite aspect of the audio, however would have to be the score. As I said about Williams' score (also nominated for an Oscar, by the way), the music really does help make the story that more endearing, and it was a wonderful thing to hear in a 7-channel mix. Definitely show this disc of to your friends if they have any doubts about lossless audio.<br /><br />Extras - (n/a)<br /><br />This is actually a rental from Netflix at the moment. I could review the extras from the first disc, but I'm a bit of a completionist and would rather have the entire set to review, so I'll edit this whenever I own the entire 4-disc set.<br /><br />Overall - 5.0<br /><br />War Horse really caught me by surprise. I thought very little of this film from the initial trailers, but I'm so glad it exceeded my expectations. Instead of being just a story about a boy and his horse, it goes so much more beyond that. It's about bonding and the strength it give us to endure through tough, difficult situations like separation, loss, and other hardships we may encounter through life. But as long as the bond stays strong and we continue to drive ourselves, that feeling can go even beyond human perception and show through animals. The message itself is a great one, and my only real gripe with the film is that the wartime stuff wasn't graphic enough to really show how horrible it is. Then again, I could just watch grittier stuff like Black Hawk Down or Saving Private Ryan. But with a very moving story, reference video and audio, and I guess a healthy amount of extras whenever I actually get around to reviewing them, War Horse comes highly recommended.
B009O07NDY|5.0|I enjoy Shore's &#34;Ring&#34; music so much that I spent alot of $$$ buying the entire soundtracks to all three movies. BUT...here's the thing: since this is a new trilogy, why didn't he take more chances? New, more developed major themes?  I get the need to have SOME continuity, but would like to see more &#34;risk&#34; in the last two soundtracks...

B0002234LS|5.0|My license plates say LVJNYDP so I'm a bit biased. This was his first movie after Pirates1 and he is on fire. Stephen King is my favorite writer so to see them paired together was a gift from above. This is true suspense. The end is a HUGE surprise. You'll watch it over and over again
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing story and such great creativity through the entire book definitely one of the best books I've ever read. Very pleased!
B000001EHS|5.0|Of course it opens with POUR SOME SUGAR ON ME and that just gets you pumpin'. This is the best of my generation. Too bad someone invented rap.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this book just as much as I loved the other two. Unfortunately, I was moving to another state while I was in the middle of reading it, so I had to put it down more often than I wanted to.  I know there is a lot of controversy about theses books, but let me just say that this trilogy is about more than BDSM or sex. It is love concurs all story about an extremely, emotionally disturbed man, who meets a woman who he can't live without.  Because of this, he is able to work through his issues & learn to love. I will definitely read this series over & over again because I just can't get enough of it. I've already read the 1st book twice & I'm half way through the 2nd. I started it just a few days before this one was released. I highly recommend this series... Yes, it's kind-of dark at times... grey, if you will, but it's not anything like anything I've ever read before. I'm so glad I decided to bite the bullet & read it.

B000AM6OQ2|5.0|&#34;The Fog&#34; is one of my favorite horror movies because it is more suspense than gore, and it's definitely my favorite John Carpenter.  What was a pleasant surprise is how interesting the special features are on this disc.  For a movie that was made back before DVDs and special features, they've put together a wonderful couple of reels -- a great blooper reel and two mini-documentaries that give fascinating background on this film (there's quite a story behind the making of this film) and on Carpenter's work in general.

B000UZPIAW|5.0|Being a young recovering alcoholic/addict this book was just an amazing read for me. I could relate to Nikki in so many ways through his paranoia and psychosis with cocaine addiction that at times it gave me goose bumps. Through his struggle to find his sobriety Nikki brings a new light to anybody who is struggling with addiction/alcoholism or for somebody who needs to feel what it's like to be in the shoes of a struggling addict/alcoholic. I will be adding this to my top 10 and spreading the word to read this amazing book!
B00846REIS|2.0|I don't usually leave reviews but I was really disappointed after so many people were telling me to read this book. First of all there is a great storyline to this no question about. But could have been much better written. Some of the raunchy things said in the book just made me cringe reading it. Describing the sex scenes  could have been done a lot more tastefully. I'm not one who despises the \\"C\\" word but i don't think the author could have used the word any more than she did. Even 50 Shades had a little bit more class. Wish I could get my money back.
B004HW7JH4|4.0|I wasn't enthralled with Dons new wife.  To make her intelligent seemed awkward.  It seems to me that the writers are trying too hard to get all the 60s mores into the the show at the expense of character development.  I hated Bettys foray into Weight Watchers.  But I am a fan forever.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Fantastic. Book I couldn't put it down. The last part keeps you on your toes and wanting more. I recommend it to anyone
B005544TRQ|5.0|Watching the show is fun for both me and my wife, which is relatively rare in a TV show.  Highly recommended!
B005COO1X6|5.0|It's been a long time since I read a short story. What a great one to start with. Had me engaged from the start.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my daughter - it's our favorite Christmas movie.  We're a couple of cotton-headed ninny-muggins!!!!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This a good book that l like to read and look up word and it help me what I need to look up and what ever letter from the first to the last of it
B007R3AZNK|5.0|I don't know how his albums get better with each one released, but they do. Love the range and style of the songs included on this disc.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|And it help real? Well for anybody that need  to look up any words that can help. U need help with  word u can .go to the. Book
B008SOS63S|5.0|Great guitarist. Great sound quality for live recording. It's one of my favorites - and my dad's too! Buy it.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|This was a fast paced movie that kept me on the edge of my seat.  Like most movies there are many unrealistic parts but as long as you can suspend reality and you enjoy action movie, you will enjoy this one.
B004LSJCJM|5.0|Blues tunes at a bar raised continually by Joe himself. Good mix of songs (tempo, topic...) to showcase his crazy guitar skills. Highly suggest!
B001OQCV2E|5.0|Yes the science isn't perfect, but its fun and doesn't pretend to be something from PBS or science channel. While much of the science is fringe, the danger of being near Yellowstone is not exaggerated as we are overdue for a volcanic eruption from it- which is why I live in extreme SE Arizona and no nearer.<br /><br />The point is what the people do is how people react in disaster situations. Do they help each other so the most people can survive with the best chance of long term survival for all? Or do they just look out for themselves and sabotage everyone else so they have a greater chance of survival without having to share, the shortsighted view. This movie could be any lifeboat type of film and set any similar situation, other than this Science Fiction one. Does anyone seriously think any commercially made movie, much less an obvious “disaster movie” is completely scientifically accurate when it might impinge on the drama? It’s an excellent B movie that had an A budget and treatment. And it’s fun, with good actors!
B00574P9EQ|4.0|As with most children's movies not made by pre Disney Pixar, this has so much adult humor that can be mistaken for behavior to model, showing it to children who do not have a very firm purchase on what is right and wrong is risky.  That said it is a funny movie.
0451232577|5.0|This historical novel weaves the lives of several families into historical events of the first 20+ years of the 20th century.  This is a must read?  I have also read the second volume Winter Of the World<br />& it was equally good.  I wish Ken Follett would hurry & release the third volume;  many of the characters have been left in limbo.  The way Ken Follett has continued to follow the lives of several families from Russia, Germany, England & the USA reminds me of the Herman Wouk novels Winds of  War & War & Rembrance.  The only negative I could possibly find is that you won't want to put the books down & turn out that light at night. :-)
B00475AUWW|5.0|I really like this book and have read it numerous times.  It's an easy read with lots of good info, that is applicable outside of the realm of creating art as well.  If you are at all interested in pursuing an artistic hobby semi-seriously, this one is a must read.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|If you own a Kindle you need this little app. It is simple, beautiful and works perfectly.  I've used it twice in two days to remove folders full of junk left behind after I deleted apps that didn't work for me.  Use this and save your Kindle's space for the stuff you really want.
B000FBFMFW|2.0|I absolutely loved the first book of this series.  So much so, perhaps my expectations were too high for the 2nd... regardless, I have tried to finish it several times but have been unsuccessful.  I keep putting it down.  It's not terrible, but given the author constructed such interesting characters and a fascinating world, it's a shame that this book doesn't dare to go further.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this one.
B005KELR3A|5.0|These are great cases.  No odor, just the right size and good quality.  I bought these for my kids who take their Kindles to school every day.  The zip case is much better than a sleeve model for traveling aorund.  Highly recommend this case.
B00AKKS278|5.0|There's little harm in giving this book a shot... I've surprised myself how easy it has been to stick to the books prescribed program.  For this genre, that's a rare thing indeed.<br /><br />I love it though... having such a productive morning truly does effect your whole day.  My motivation only increases as the days go on.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|My husband and I are A Capella nerds and enjoyed this film.  The romance was sweet and the characters were fun.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I play this everyday. I got it free, but if u cant get it free...its worth the buy. Great for all ages....from 8-32 for sure.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I have read many of Grisham's Novels,and each one is very exciting.<br />This book I read in two days. It had a different twist to it.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Excellent software that let you download Youtube and watch it offline later.  I try alot other software but they are hard to use, this one is very easy to use and work great.

0007466064|5.0|I love these books.  The characters live and breath, the scope of the story is infinite and I force myself to read slow so I can savor every page.  Just wish he would write faster.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Its a nice blu-ray.Lots of extra feauters.3D its amazing and im glad that i bought this version.Plus you can download to your other device.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was my favorite book of the series!  Definitely a page turner - I can't wait to see Jennifer Lawrence in the movie.
0345529057|5.0|Awesome books. Only complaint is I gave it as a gift and the books are not in the package in order so my friend almost read them out of order.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|This was a good movie! It was of course somewhat cheesy at parts, but lots of good action overall and pretty good storyline.
B000X3UJ00|5.0|I have been a huge Harry Potter fan since 2004. While deployed to Afghanistan I watched the first three movies and read the first four books. My collection now includes all eight movies on both DVD and Bluray, the American version books and the British version of the books. Once I heard that their was the British version with the title Philosopher's Stone it became a must buy. I believe that anyone who has a love for the series should consider adding this to their collection.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The writing style and use of words was amazing, you just can't put the book down. So glad the author put it all in one book  , so tired of authors dragging out the stories. This book is complete and is a perfect length. You will not be sorry you read it.
B008220D7S|3.0|I wouldn't really call this a comedy.  Mostly a \\"coming of age\\" story for adults.  Most of the comedy is in the shock value of the profanity dropped it via the children or in their current setting.  Except for the occasional moment, much of the comedy felt as if it were clumsily dropped into your lap, rather than smoothly delivered.<br /><br />The movie seems to be more of a loose collection of random stories, many of which have no real resolution, such as a side story about an employee that really doesn't seem to go anywhere.  I kept feeling as each of the struggles and extraneous character interactions were supposed to have some kind \\"moral\\" or explore some kind of meaning in relationships, but many seem just tacked on to add even more time to the movie.  While the side stories that are resolved are done well enough for the main story to continue, I felt there was a lot of wasted time that could have been used for better development of a character or relationships between the characters.<br /><br />Movie-wise this all takes place within a few days of each other from one 40th birthday party to another, but it does so in a meandering fashion.  Its by no means a dreadful movie, but it doesn't pace well, and very easily forgettable.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Not my style of book. I would not select again. I usually can read most any book but just could not get interested in this one.
0544045203|5.0|It was so hard to put this book down!  Reading this book became my priority and yet I didn't want it to end. Life of Pi is now one of my favorite books. This story will touch your heart and light up your soul.  It is an amazing story that I would recommend to everyone!
B007WOFXAO|5.0|WAS LOOKING TO FILL IN SOME MISSING ALBUMS FROM MY OLD VINYL DAYS. JUST BOUGHT HOLIDAY AT FYE WHEN I SAW THIS 5 ALBUM SET ON LINE! ORDERED IT ANYWAY FOR THE PRICE. I STILL LIKE HAVING CDS AS ARCHIVE!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Massive performance boost over my old e6850. I got a ~30% improvement in fps in pretty much every game I play using the same old gtx 460. It's almost amazing how good this is for the price.
B000OLRH10|5.0|Dicaprio's character is well developed. The film has a balanced blend of action, relevency, emotion and drama. The actor who portays the village fisherman, Solomon Vandi, is ultra-real. The film is consuming.
B009MO57H6|5.0|I dont own the dvd i rentede it from redbox. but this movie is really great. they even included the chainsaw villain from the resident evil 4 and 5 games. and it was great seeing the video game characters in the movie. because of the negative reviews you should rent first but i loved this movie
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I only player it once.  It seems complicated and my grandson is the one who had me download it.  I played it for a while but just couldn't get into it.  I will try again and it seems that it could be addicting if you know how to play it.
0525478817|5.0|First free reading book in more than a few months and well worth it. Read it straight through with no breaks and enjoyed every moment of it. I laughed, I cried, it moved me, Bob. The book was even one of the 150,000 signed by the author, John Green, which was not expected at all. Such unexpected bonuses made this purchase a wonderful choice.
B008FYZIVY|4.0|Baby boomers will love this... It's regal with a twist of mystery... It's not for everyone but if you're reading this, you'll like it.
1401322425|3.0|My kids and I love watching Jamie on TV, especially the series accompanying this book.  I think I just liked the show better and found it more inspiring than the text.  This really sits on  my shelf unused.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|My grand daughter was thrilled to receive this movie for Christmas.  I was not able to watch it with her, but was told by my son that it was a great movie. Would tell anyone that my granddaughter loved it.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|As the Les Miz story line is so familiar, I assume that a plot review will not be seen as a \\"spoiler.\\"  But if you are so inclined, please read no further....<br /><br />One author recently provided this contrast: \\"If the American Revolution was a success because the leaders who went on to build the country had a proper understanding of human nature, the French Revolution was a failure because the rebels got it wrong from the get-go....the result was the creation of the most despotic regime to date\\" ([[ASIN:030788533X Why Catholicism Matters, p. 20]]).  Quoting from [[ASIN:1574551094 # 407 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church]], the author maintains the American framers' understanding to be more consistent with the Catholic: \\"Ignorance of the fact that man has a wounded nature inclined to evil gives rise to serious errors in the areas of education, politics, social action, and morals\\" ([[ASIN:030788533X p. 21]]).<br /><br />Les Miserables opens in a destitute, \\"miserable,\\" early 19th century, post-revolution France.  It is the familiar tale of Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), who has been released from two decades of torturous prison after stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister's family.<br /><br />Shortly after his release, Valjean steals silver from a cleric and appears headed back to prison.  Instead, the priest intervenes and starts Valjean on a road of redemption.  I found the religious elements (which are everywhere!) to be exceedingly more clear, than I found several years ago in the Broadway rendition.<br /><br />To become a new man, Valjean decides that he must break free of the conditions of parole for prisoner \\"24601\\" and take a new identity.  In spite of subsequent success in business and in developing an admirable moral character, Valjean's life will continue to cross paths with the relentless Inspector Javert (Russell Crowe) - who is hell bent on returning Valjean to prison.<br /><br />Valjean's life also crosses paths with Fantine (Ann Hathaway),a single mom who has been economically raped, in her desperate efforts to support her beloved Cosette. Hathaway's rendition of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" is even better than that of Susan Boyle and certainly more heartbreaking:<br /><br />\\"I had a dream my life would be<br />So different from this hell I'm living<br />So different now from what it seemed<br />Now life has killed the dream I dreamed.\\"<br /><br />On Fantine's deathbed, Valjean assures her that he will find and care for Cosette.  He then rescues Cosette from the \\"care\\" of the Thénardier innkeeper family (Helen Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen).  \\"Borat\\" certainly portrays the despicable nature of M. Thénardier's character.  Yet, the Thénardiers' appearances are over the top and provide a gratuitous crudeness that detracts from this otherwise wonderful film.<br /><br />Fast forward to 1832 and another revolution - young Cosette has fallen in love with the idealistic revolutionary student, Marius.  It is sacrificial love from both the Thénardier's daughter Eponine and Valjean, which ultimately saves Marius from himself.  United in marriage, the love of Fantine, Eponine, and Valjean has set the stage for Marius and Cosette to live \\"happily ever after.\\"<br /><br />This is a a wonderful film, ultimately filled with the hopefulness of redemption and eternal life.
B0094K1K42|1.0|I watched this movie expecting to see Charlize Theron magic. It never picks up in interest, character development is weak, moral is non-existent, and the ending is unfulfilling.
0316228532|4.0|This novel received mixed reviews, and I can see why. After a decade of whimsical, yet dark Harry Potter books, nobody expected this slow-building, cynical look at class warfare and self-centered suburban drama.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy had a slow start and a lot of characters to keep track of (it was likely a big mistake naming in-laws Shirley and Samantha so that readers could confuse them for 500 pages) but it was a beautiful piece of literature. I think that the main reason for the starkly negative reviews, is that Rowling forces many a reader to see something detestable in themselves. She allows the reader to build up opinions of her flawed characters before revealing pasts and virtues to make the reader feel as judgmental as the loathsome Mollison family. Rowling shows clear political leanings that may have alienated socially conservative readers. I have to say, though, if you know anything of Rowling's biography as a single mother who escaped an abusive marriage and cared for her daughter with government assistance before writing Harry Potter, becoming richer than the Queen, and donating millions of her personal fortune to charity, you should not be surprised.<br /><br />This book is heartbreaking, darkly funny, and worth giving a chance to get started. I expected a light and snappy comedy, which might have been fun but ultimately shallow; I am much better for this unexpected read.
0525478817|5.0|This is one of the best books that I read in 2012.  Both heartwarming and heartbreaking, without taking itself too seriously.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is a well-written book full of humor, tears, and characters so real that I can imagine them walking into my high school classroom tomorrow. John Green wrote a cancer book, but unlike every other piece of media I've ever seen about cancer, the kids in it are not teenaged angels waiting to be reclaimed by God. They are real and flawed and scared. I highly recommend this book to adults and young adults.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Did not think it was as good as the last ones but worth watching. Just not as funny but the story was good.
0439023513|5.0|This book was beautifully written, focusing the right amount on action and balancing it with beautifully painted portraits of Katniss' mental state. It has been a long time since I have read anything that shocked and wounded me like the moment when the parachute went off. Suzanne Collins creates a world of characters realistically rendered, fleshed out by varying shades of grey. Nothing is black and white. The end will make you cry but leave you incredibly satisfied. What a knock-out series.
B00APUQPX6|3.0|Did not think it was as good as the last ones but worth watching. Just not as funny but the story was good.
006097625X|4.0|This book was published in 1992, so some of the discussion about where comics are now, happens to be twenty years old. That said, I really enjoyed this book and its insights. I think McCloud doesn't always give prose enough credit (he seems to think that only comics can evoke the five senses). That said, it's an excellent breakdown of comics for &#34;newbs&#34; and still very valuable to life-long comic readers. It certainly wasn't bad for a University textbook. :)
B005USZYDU|5.0|i jave really enjoyed reading  John grimson's Theodore  Boone  kid lawyer. i would recommend reading more his books. it is about a kid whoms mother is a lawyer and his father is a lawyer. his class wants to go to a trial and he gets it arranged. thr cold blooded killer who they are going to execute is  innocent  and he has  to find the real killer before itis too late.
0679720200|3.0|This book felt like Hemingway wrote Holden Caulfield, and so something bad happened.<br /><br />It was very much a product of its time (1946). We have a totally detached, unemotional hero smoking and shagging and observing sad people. It was frustrating to watch his lack of eloquence and charisma destroy him and the character was not at all sympathetic. I am pretty certain that this was the point. It was very successful at what it was trying to be, but that something is not my kind of book.
0763644765|5.0|My son started to potty train himself at age 18 months.  We LIVED with this book for the next year.  It was the ONLY book he wanted to read every time he was on the potty.  Although I think he was a little precocious training himself, over time this book helped reinforce going to the potty and not in his pants.  We had him completely out of diapers by the time he was two and I credit this book for a lot of that.  Excellent fun story that really reinforces the concept of going potty.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|G5 has some of the best games ive played on kindle and the 2.99 price isn't bad for the amount of challenge and entertainment

B009YP9L7U|2.0|In a word, \\"Meh.\\" When a book starts out with a hungover heroine puking in the toilet, I admit, the heroine's probably going to have to save puppies from a burning shelter to get me on her side. In this one, there are no puppies, no burning shelter, and absolutely no redemption. These are two people who really had no reason to be together, a cast of hateful secondary characters, and the idea that whenever life gets rough, getting blotto is the answer. Megan is in Vegas for her cousin's wedding and her cousin's friends are belittling her for choosing artificial insemination, rather than the traditional method of husband first, baby later. But Megan doesn't believe in love, thanks to the revolving door in her mother's bedroom. Connor wants the wife and family but saw how love ruined his mother when she fell for a married man who wouldn't leave his wife but wouldn't set her free either. He plans to treat marriage like a business arrangement. This is a couple who spend most of their time negotiating over every aspect of their married lives: from when to announce their marriage to when they'll have sex. But when the big crisis arises, it's a quickie makeup and let's stay together that has no basis in reality. I see nothing but a vicious divorce and AA meetings for these two. I can only hope they break up before kids are added into the equation.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|From other reviews and the ad pics, I could tell the game is beautifully-rendered, but I didn't get a sense of actually what the game play is like, but I bought it anyway for my Kindle Fire for $5. The game play is moving around pieces of goo that link together to build a truss bridge or path from a starting point to the goal (usually a pipe on the other side of the screen). The challenge is the goo only link together in certain ways and gravity, wind, fire, gears, etc. get in the way. The game is fun,  challenging, but not overly difficult. My 6-year-old and 9-year-old both enjoy playing it too. $5 for a Kindle app seemed on the high side in my opinion, but I think it's worth the price.
B000HF6XKO|3.0|Confusing and hard to follow.  Pretty good acting I suppose, but convoluted story line which jumps around a lot. Does give insight into how closely interrelated corporations and government probably are.
B0054JELTI|4.0|First time I have watched it. It was a good movie that was pretty funny. The PG rating is appropriate and you need to make a good judgement for your children.
B0058YPL66|4.0|This series has a fun plot to follow episode after episode. There are some of those stupid things, like<br />of course your going to go talk to someone to verify the facts consider the established evil nature of<br />the person giving out the bad news, or pretending to be your friend. But overall, it is an entertaining watch.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book! A friend recommended it to me so I thought I'd see what it was all about and absolutely could not put it down!!!
B0051OZ564|4.0|This film does a very good job of giving you the impression of some pretty sordid behavior without getting graphic about. You get sucked into the main characters situation and the tension builds nicely throughout the film. There is meaning in the film that goes deeper then just the main plot. The action sequences are a bit outrageous, but frankly they are entertaining and well done. I would recommend it.
B008ZVNC2O|5.0|Mick Hucknall has the most distinctive voice, and he can sing anything from a beautiful ballad to rock, reggae, blues and soul. As the leader and songwriter of Simply Red since mid eighties he has sold over 50 million albums over the years. I have all his CD's and most of his DVD concerts. He's a supreme performer and his band sounds as good live as it does on CDs. Now that Simply Red is no more, Mick will draw on his talent and record songs he's known and loved and wanted to sing his whole life, as well as write new ones, and I can't wait for the next one!

B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I found this film to hold my attention throughout as I tried to make sense of the time travel.  It has been alleged in the past that when going back or forward in time you needed to avoid making contact with yourself. Apparently this is not true as Spock revealed in the latest Star Trek and now in Looper.  This is good to know for when I make the trip into time myself.  Looper is exciting and action packed coupled with thought provoking concepts.  A fun movie.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is a great book full of humor, with several references to both Greek and Roman mythology. I do wish it was from Percy's view the majority of the book, and not just a few chapters at a time, but it still deserves 5 stars. Also, the ending is perfect and unexpected, and I wish the next book was already available for me to buy!

B008X9Z37A|1.0|Do not buy this product thinking you are getting a bargain as I did.  It is extremely flimsy and after only three days two of the  holding tabs at each corner gave way.  I wish I had sent it back then but with he holidays and everything it just got put to the back of the drawer...

B003EV6DBM|4.0|This is one of my favorite shows.  I've been enjoying them since Tom Baker was the Doctor. Always fun and inventive.
B009NPA3Q4|2.0|I only watch AI when it gets down to the last 10 or so people. As soon as I heard Phillip Phillips, I thought he should definitely win the whole thing. I was so happy that he did. I bought the AI highlights even though it only had 5 songs on it - I LOVE all 5 - of course Home, because it's a great song, but my favorite by far was Volcano. I listen to that all the time. So when his full CD came out, I pre-ordered it. I just listened to it for the first time and I'm really disappointed in it. I guess I should have listened to the clips first, but you can't always tell about the whole song from short clips. These songs are too \\"noisy\\" for me - the music is so loud most of the time, it felt to me like it was overpowering his voice. He has such a great voice that it doesn't need to be almost drowned out. I know most people reviewing loved this album, but I FAR prefer songs where you can hear the voice up front and the music just accompanying in the back. Volcano is a perfect example of that. All in all, the only song I really liked on this album is Home, which I already have on the AI highlight album. I also agree with the reviewer who said the AI album missed a lot of the good songs he sang on the show. I hope his second album will reflect his voice better than this one.
