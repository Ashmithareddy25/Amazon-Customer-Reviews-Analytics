6304584598|5.0|4 Stars? <br />Well, when Margot Fonteyn danced, every single motion or gesture of hers was a poem of utmost beauty and she herself was the embodiment of supreme elegance. In view of the duration of her part here, she herself alone deserves 7 stars! Nureyev himself also deserves 6 stars as a dancer: there is hardly anyone either from Kirov or any other place who could seriously challenge him. The rest, especially by today's standard, are all 5 star ballerinas, and there are masses of them here.<br />For most ballet music, the composers tailor made their music to the requirements of the choreography. Tsaichovsky was an exception, his musical imagination was given a free hand: the original choreographist accommodated him and changed some of his part in accordance with his music. That partly explains why Tsaichovsky's Swan Lake or Sleeping Beauty was such great music outshinging any other ballet music. Anyway, music and choreography in ballet should go either hand in hand or as glove befitting hand. Here lies the main drawback of this DVD: the choreography doesn't tie in well with the music and was often at odd with it! Nureyev, however great a dancer he was, didn't have good ears for music, it could also be seen from the conductor of the accompanying orchestra he preferred (?) whose treatment of Swan Lake is so out of line.<br />Nureyev introduced some new and novel elements in his choreography, notably the use of properties, say the roses, the bow and arrow, and the large clothes representing waves on the stage that at last engulfed the prince. He also mobilized masses of ballerinas to create various shapes, making them as scented as flowers. Even when they are only some simple geometric matrixes, they are equally spectacular especially when seen from a height. <br />The stage settings are great, the costumes too and there are numerous of them. Of course, viewers must bear in mind that however brilliant the photography was, it was filmed in 1968 after all. Furthermore, there are at times some makeshifts, however brief that may be, they are quite prosaic or even static: Nureyev was by then not as matured a choreographist as he later was, as could be seen from his \\"Sleeping Beauty with Ballet De L'opera De Paris\\".
B00008PX8P|5.0|Perhaps the most important release in music video history will happen May 27th 2003.  By far the most important event for 2003 musically speaking.<BR>This is an Official Led Zeppelin Video release of Live Material.  Do you know how RARE that is?  Led Zeppelin has only had a scarce few releases in the past 23 years.  Jimmy Page is delivering on his promise.  Lets deliver on ours.  Buy both the CD & DVD, take off the day, or week as some have said, and watch history.
0060537639|4.0|The book isn't the best reading but the subject matter is awesome and I later saw Menzies on CSPAN at The India Club.  He seemed to support his claims very well with a series of visuals.<br />A lot of what I learned about the world's history came after I was in my 20's.  I don't want to get off subject by listing the many examples.<br />I feel that white people can't stand the fact that they weren't the first to discover everything.  Let's face it...Columbus didn't discover America.  He still made quite an achievement but he wasn't the 1st.
B00008YLV2|5.0|The only word I believe I could form was wow after seeing this in the theater.  It is not needed for me to go into any plot lines because a lot of other reviews do so.  The film is real, and grabs it's audience, shakes them good, leaving them with astonishment about what really goes on during war.  Black Hawk Down might not exatcly be entertainment.  It's more like a powerful message about the horror of war, told \\"in your face\\".  <br />I cannot wait for the 3 disc set to be released.  Ridley Scott's comments on his masterpiece should be insightful and informative.  It is clear he was born to direct material like this.  <br />Black Hawk Down is gritty, realistic, and mind blowing.  I'm glad we will now all be able to get a look in the head's of the creators.  Bravo.
0793518326|4.0|The Beatles Complete Scores is without doubt the best deal<BR>in Music Publishing.  I've read some reviews of this book, that claimed that some songs were incomplete.  I think this is due to the misunderstanding of the notation system used in this book.<BR>It is very similar to the type of system used in the UK based \\"Off The Record\\" series of Score books.  When a part is played a second time, the repeated part is shown in parenthesis.<BR>It helps if you can read music; so that you understand this while following the tab.  Due to space restrictions, obviously there may be a few licks left out on some songs during a 3rd repeat, but at least you do get a complete transcription.  They've fit in as much as they possibly could (which is why the parenthesis system was used - it saves on using additional pages to show what's played when a certain section is repeated.)  The accuracy isn't perfect, but it's quite good for the most part.<BR>Of course the best guitar transcriptions available are the ones from the guitar magazines and the Hal Leonard Recorded Version series books by the top American transcribers.  If you keep in mind that this book was transcribed back in about '88, then these were quite good for the time (not to mention the amount of detail that is given.)<br />Every instrument is transcribed for each track, along with tablature for both the Guitar & Bass.  I don't think there's a better deal around for the money.  Transcribing is not a perfect art; I've seen many books show Revolution transcribed in both the key of Bb and B; while I'm almost positive that it was recorded in A, but with the master tape sped up, making it sound between Bb and B.  Makes sense when Revolution 1 is in A itself.<BR>This book shows it in Bb.  The most accurate transcription of that song for guitar and bass is from Guitar World magazine, transcribed by Andy Aledort (showing it in A, and mentioning as I have above as to why it sounds between Bb and B.)  I just mentioned this to pointout that no transcribed books are perfect; but overall for a book of complete scores, this one is pretty good; especially if you think how much it must have cost the publishers to transcribe all of these songs for all instruments as well as the typesetting.
B0000028VT|5.0|In 1993, grunge was in full swing,..., And thank goodness this album put me out of the seattle midwestern [junk] and brought me into happiness, great songs, mariah's excellent voice and others.<BR>I Hope mariah continues.
B000000W3G|5.0|This is, as you may already know, a compilation of all the singles from Mellon Collie....They explore so many different styles on this album, from hardcore rock to well, er, ballads. If you're a fan of Iha like me, you'll happy to know that this album is full of his music. The contrast of Billy and James in this album is one of the main things that makes this album so special. The fact that Mellon Collie was a double disc and still had so many b-sides left over just shows how incredible songwriters they are. And if that wasn't enough, this includes the Pastichao Medley, a complilation of a few second clips of all the ideas that they didn't use. No doubt about it, this is the pumpkins at their best.
B000003TAR|1.0|When I Was a kid I Was happy with Guns N Roses Sweet child o' mine and Poison's nutting but a good time, I'll take any of those over this ... excuse of an album, boring depressing lyrics, this and nevermind were ..., it got worse when nu metal came, I'm glad kurt is gone and this band doesn't exist anymore, and I Also got out of that genre and listen to mariah carey's music box.<BR>This is painful.
B00004TA41|5.0|This album is as deep as the ocean. If I could take one c.d. with me on a desert island, this is it. For me, listening to this album has turned out to be an extremely worthwile exploration. I've never heard Coltrane so free, so unrestricted; and as a byproduct of this freedom, you can literally hear him thinking, as he seems to pull countless innovative, fresh, and pure genius improvisations out of thin air, time after time. It's almost as if he knew his time left on this earth was very limited, and he wanted to let all those ideas out that he was holding back for another day. Emotionally, it spans the entire spectrum. I tend to hear expressions of Joy and Eternity quite a bit. In one particular instance, I hear an expression of  sheer anger or terror, and it really scares the hell out of me every time I hear it; it is so expressive. I think the abscence of the piano was a great idea, as I feel it can sometimes set limitations. It truly seems that I could listen to this album 1000 times in a row and I would hear something new and innovative every time..I could best sum it up as a complete explosion of ideas, hitting you from all sides.
B00005JLK1|4.0|&quot;Ghost Ship&quot; is a story idea fraught with possibilities that never quite comes off.  At 91 minutes, the film is too short and not scary enough, while some of the scenes contained herein border on tasteless gore.  <BR>PLOT: In a nutshell, a salvage group in present day gets duped into going after an ocean liner that disappeared in 1960.  No, the ship didn't sink.  It just became repopulated by ghosts.  <BR>Transfer wise, this is a very nice looking DVD.  Colors during the opening sequence (supposed to be taking place in 1960 on the last night anyone was seen aboard the ship) are bold, colorful and brilliantly balanced.  When we fast forward to present day and the ship is seen in its various stages of decay, the muted color scheme is equally well balanced with rich browns, deep blacks and incredibly fine detail evident in the background information, even under the lowest of lighting conditions.  Edge enhancement, aliasing and shimmering are virtually non-existant on this DVD.  This is a stunning visual experience.  The audio is equally impressive, mixed to 5.1 and sounding of incredibly vivid, rich basses, perfectly pitched trebles and a lot of power during the action sequences.  <BR>Extras: A ship full - beginning with several in-depth documentaries on the making of the movie, a comprehensive behind the scenes look, interviews with the stars, deleted scenes, a really fun &quot;mysteries of&quot; featurette and the film's theatrical trailer.  Plus bonus features for your DVD-ROM.  WOW!<BR>BOTTOM LINE:  So much more could have been done with the plot that I really can't recommend the movie on its own merit.  You won't be scared.  You might be grossed out.  But for sure, as far as the transfer quality goes, you'll be impressed!
1878424505|5.0|a simple read with a powerful message<BR>a re-read--look over again book
B00005YW4H|5.0|I was a Norah Jones doubter.  I'm 45, a hard-bitten attorney, and a fan of tough-singing people like Elmore James, Hound Dog Taylor, Dorothy Love Coates, Neko Case, and Lavay Smith.  (And if you don't know Neko and Lavay:  what voices!)  I saw the CD, looked at it, couldn't believe that it would be anything more than a light snack.  But then I met a bright, lovely woman who convinced me that Ms. Jones is worth a listen--and I listened and was smitten.  Ton of bricks.  Mack truck.  Freight train.  She just bowled me over.  I have been listening to the CD almost constantly for the past several days, and it keeps getting better.  Yes, the stuff is simple, mainly slow-moving--but listen to it for what it is, and I think you'll agree that she's brilliant.  That peau-de-soie voice of hers is a treasure.  But beyond that, she is obviously one very smart gal whose phrasing improves her material.  She's a prodigy.  I'm grateful for the tremendous gift of her artistry.
0393317552|1.0|The author is a physiologist by trade. He is an amatuer historian, and fairly average at deductions and his scope of knowledge.His knowledge of biology is very good, but his history knowledge is suspect. He asks all the right questions, but his answers prove to be that of a biology major attempting to answer historical dilemma's. None of his speculations are original - they are all things I have read before. He makes some odd conclusions that are suspect at best, and presents them as facts.<br />He also claims that the biggest event in world history is Pizzaro's capture of the Inca ruler. If your going to go down that road, Cortez is the easy choice. Most scholars would not rank Pizarro in the top 100, while putting Cortez in the top 5.<br />Overall it is intersting reading, but I am surprised it got some rave reviews from critics. \\"A history of the world\\" by Hugh Thomas is much more interesting, more accurate, and far better.<br />It also appears Diamond borrowed most of his conclusions from previous works - I failed to find one original idea.
B00004Y6NW|5.0|As many other reviewers have said, this is quite simply Dire Straits' most enduring album. It still holds up well almost 30 years after many of the songs were penned. My personal favourite would have to be 'In The Gallery' - a quiet protest against the agents who exploit artists - whatever their genre may be. This could ring true for so many in the industry! However, all of the songs are gems and Knopfler's uncluttered, stylish Strat-playing gives them a mature nature. Worth the money!
0156027321|5.0|This unusual story is a wonderfully rich book.  It is so effectively written that the reader is carried alongwith Pi through his amazing experiences with a youthful exuberence tempered by the thoughtfulness of his solitude, leading you to wonder whether the story is true or invented.<BR>I bought this book because of its lovely cover (always judge a book by its cover!), and was stunned that the inside matched the outside in its simple beauty.
B00004U8PA|5.0|I first saw The Rocky Horrow show in the theater at the midnight showings with other fans and it was an amazing experience.  I was hooked from the start.  The music is the first thing that gets you.  It is fantastic!  The cast is electric, especially Tim Curry as Frank-n-Furter.  His singing is superb and his facial expressions are just too funny!  <br />People are not supposed to take this movie seriously.  It is simply poking fun at B-movies and old sci-fi flicks mixed with sexual inuendos and gender-bending.  I personally think it's a great mixture (and I'm as straight as they come) and guarantees fun for all. I was lucky enough to see The Rocky Horror Show live on stage last night and it was wonderful.  The audience participation is second to none.  Go and experience it if you can, but buy the film first so you know what to expect and then you must buy the soundtrack and turn the sound up loud!  You won't be able to help singing along and dancing.  Let your hair down and enjoy it!
B000084T18|5.0|..is wrong wit all of yall that dont like this album.  out of the living rappers, he comes close to numba 1. <BR>if you do not own this cd yet, heres a little piece,&quot;u shouldnt throw stones if you live in a glass house, and if you got a glass jaw you should watch your mouth, coz i break  ur face.&quot;     if you dont think thats ill then you are just another wanksta.
B00006AVRK|5.0|There are not a lot of glowing words I say about this DVD collection that haven't already been said, but I will try.  Having read numerous books about the characters of Jeeves and Wooster, and listened to BBC radio collection performances, I have to say all the characters seem to hit the mark in bringing P G Wodehouse's creations to the screen.  I have laughed a lot watching the amazing Bertie Wooster botch well-meant attempts to help(?) his friends.  Mr Laurie and Mr Fry really do all they can to bring out the humor and wisdom of the stories.  The other characters, both the recurring ones and the infrequently appearing ones, are also spot on with their roles.  The twins, Claude and Eustace, had me rolling on the floor with their relentless pursuit of the singer.  If you enjoy P.G. Wodehouse's stories, you will truly enjoy these DVD's.  I know I will watch them over and over, as I have listened to BBC tapes I bought in the 1980's.  Two very good comedic actors put their marks on some excellent Jeeves and Wooster stories.  I only wish there were more of them in the series to watch.
B000002UAR|5.0|There is flat-out not a single bad song on this record.  It is the best record recorded by the best band ever.  Period.  No record collection is complete without this album.
0679745203|4.0|Ondaatje's style is truly what stands out in this book: at once poetic and intellectual, sensual and political, it always catches you by surprise. Often I had to read a paragraph or a page several times, because meaning comes in subtle hints and images. It's frustrating at times, and there are still some parts of the book that are slightly confusing (why does Cavaraggio rob a house naked?), but it's worth the trouble for the sheer beauty of it.  Consider this passage for example:<br />\\"We die containing a richness of lovers and tribes, tastes we have swallowed, bodies we have plunged into and swum up as if rivers of wisdom, characters we have climbed into as if trees, fears we have hidden in as if caves. I wish for all this to be makred on my body when I am dead. I believe in such cartography- to be marked by nature, not just to label ourselves on a map like the names of rich men and women on buildings.  We are communal histories, communal books.  We are not owned or monogamous in our taste or experience. All I desired was to walk upon such an earth that had no maps.\\" (p261 paperback)<br />Read this book aloud or listen to Ralph Fienne's beautiful voice. Read it once, leave it for a while, then read it again. And again and again.
B00003CXB4|5.0|There is no need to go into any real depth here.  Most people have already seen it, and if you havn't, you REALLY should, it really is one of the best Disney movies of all time...Not just Disney, in any category!  You wont be disappointed.
B00003CXXM|4.0|I watched the bourne identity and minority report one after another, and of the two I like the bourne identity better.  I liked the flow of the movie and the give and take of matt damon and the woman whose car he &quot;borrowed.&quot;  I would watch it again and buy the dvd again.
B000069HK2|5.0|I like to think of myself as an impartial reviewer:  I try not to hold allegiances to bands or genres, and don't take extraband matters into account.  I wish other people that write reviews would do the same.  I have to say that this may be the best music purchase I've made so far in 2003.  I sat in awe in my car as I listened to this CD.  I found it intensely moving, much like Glassjaw's EYEWTKAS album.  The singer sounds with such conviction with the sing/scream mix.  He has a high quality scream but also has excellant range with his singing voice.  The other musical aspects of this album are also very well done.  And you know what?  I don't care if they didn't write all of these songs (is this even true?), because I enjoy this CD too much to even care about stuff like that.  Maybe Memories, A Box Full of Sharp Objects, and Noise and Kisses are awesome heavy tracks, while Poetic Tragedy, On My Own and the excellant Blue and Yellow are amazing tracks that are a little moodier and softer, but still provide for an intense musical experience.  It's been a month and I still listen to this CD or atleast a song or two every day.  I think the majority of you out there will probably do the same.
B00005JL78|5.0|In the Washington of 2054, John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is an investigator for the Pre-Crime Unit, a pilot law enforcement program that uses drugged, precognitive humans wired to a computer to identify murders before they can happen.  When Anderton is identified as the future killer of someone he does not even know, he must go on the run to clear his name and uncover the dark truth behind Precrime.<br />Im a bit puzzled about some of the extremely negative reviews that have been written here about this film.  Many of them seem motivated by hostility toward Cruise, director Stephen Spielberg, or any departure from the Philip K. Dick source material as originally written.  I, on the other hand, found it to be astonishingly entertaining, well-directed, and well-scripted.  It is packed with great stuff from beginning to end: the detailed future mileau; Precrime detectives racing against time to identify the moment and location of a future murder from contextless images; robotic spiders invading an apartment building to search for Anderton;  the precog Agatha using her ability to see seconds into the future to escape from pursuers; and more.  Throw in a great cast including Colin Ferrel and the incomparable Max Von Sydow and the result is pure magic.
B00001QEE7|5.0|It's sad that many people have not seem this movie because it is &quot;a cartoon&quot;, since this is one of the best movies ever made (great for kids, great for dates). The most impressive quality of the movie has to be the music. Over half the soundtrack of the movie is a masterpiece (most of the rest is excellent), worthy of mention in any &quot;top-100 of all time&quot; music chart. Another great thing about this movie is that it has a big heart. There was obviously an unusual amount of love placed into the drawing, the acting of the characters, the voices, the colors, the photography, and the direction. If this is not the best animated feature ever made, it certainly is among the top 10 of all time. Well worth your money and time. A great gift.
B00006RU5B|2.0|Having been interrested in this project for a few years, I had my doubts and expectations in this band. In my mind, i felt that it would either a) be an outsanding and ground breaking album in the alternative music scene or b)develope a major clash of egos and cause one attrocious piece of junk. Well, when this album was released, to my surprise, it did neither. Instead, they produced an incredibly average, contrived, and tired style of music. Where in Rage Against The Machine, all instruments (guitar, bass, drums, and vocals) had their equal moments in the sun, so to speak. For example, \\"Bulls On Parade\\" showed several different solos as did the songs on \\"RATM.\\" Audioslave, on the other hand, is just (and always) guitar and vocals. I have never heard such musical upstaging in my life. What are you to expect, though? Soundgarden was always an overrated VEHICLE for Cornell. It isn't just upstaging, it's average guitar and vocals, nothing special. That isn't to say that there aren't good songs on this album. COCHISE was a promising single witha great somewhat unique style. I AM THE HIGHWAY, the album's best ballad, should have been on the radio instead of LIKE A STONE, which is, in my opinion, just a copy of Red Hot Chilli Peppers. SET IT OFF is a great, rough song and maybe the highlight of the album. Again, this is a low rating because I was a big fan of Rage and Cornell's voice. Don't approach this album with high expectations, unless your idea of great music is Nickleback or Creed.
B000066I6N|5.0|Robert Plant has never sounded so good. The songs are mostly covers, but Plant makes them his own. His is a voice of maturity, and the songs are geared for an adult audience, as befits someone who is approaching his mid-fifties. &quot;Darkness, Darkness&quot; and the radical reworking of &quot;Hey Joe&quot; are standouts, but the real gem here is Tim Buckley's &quot;Song to the Siren.&quot; This is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard and hearing Plant sing it give me chills. It is one of the few songs that affects me emotionally every time I hear it. Lest I forget, kudos to the musicians on this album- they are excellent. The production, too, is great.
0345451325|5.0|i bought this book yesterday..thats right yesterday....and i have finished. that's how good this book is. it is quite definately the most enthrawling book i have ever read. i happen to be a massive fan of the game, which is partly the reason i bought the book, and i wasn't dissapointed. the book describes the lives of the 75 spartans who were grafted into the UNSC war machine at the age of six in order to train to be bio-engineered super soldiers. it traces through their training to early missions and on into the human-covenant war. the action never lets up and i felt genuinely upset when any of the characters died-the writer makes them so familiar to the reader.<BR>this is a must read for any sci-fi military fan. it may be a book of a game and for those of you that have seen mortal combat you will know that games dont translate well to other forms of media. however halo:the fall of reach is done really well. if you have played the game you will be able to visualise each detail from the alien vessels broadsiding human ships to the way the grunts tear after the main characters during battle....i wish i could give this book 6/5
0553213105|2.0|\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is full of fluff and is nothing more than an old-fashioned soap opera.  I found the characters very one dimensional, and could not develop an opinion about them.  I felt Austen shoved the opinion at us, instead of forming our own.  The way she presented the matters of pride and prejudice was very trivial and predictable.  It is certainly not worth its hype.  I do not recommend.
B00008NG5V|5.0|Jacks first CD was good, but not earth shattering, knock your socks off good.  This one however, has made me sit up and take special notice!  The music is easy and uncomplicated, his voice mellifluous and flowing.  I love nearly every song on this CD, but pay special attention to tracks 5 and 8 which are especially soothing ...even in rush hour traffic on the Dan Ryan.  It may not be his intention to calm people with his voice, or to make one girl swoon -- but he has done just that.
B00005YW4H|2.0|I don't see what all the fuss is about, to me the only good tracks on the CD are &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; and &quot;I've Got To See You Again&quot;.  In my book a CD with only 2 good tracks is nothing to brag about.  I think Diana Krall is a far better choice in this music style.
B00005JL9A|5.0|I saw this movie in Japan at the cinemas...I was absolutely blown away on the graphic vioence that is shown!!! It is the most outrageous movie ever!!...
630463949X|5.0|This music dvd is simply one of the best around.<BR>Great sound and camerawork!<br />They really thought this one out and captured this great music group at one of their finest moments!<br />This was done in a controlled studio setting with a live audience. <br />It's a MUST for all music lovers!
B00005JLEU|5.0|Whilst I agree with the reviewer who claims that the Disney dub of this movie is rather insipid compared to the original story, he fails to mention that the original soundtrack is available also with a decent subtitle translation.  I would reccomend all adult viewers and children of a sufficient reading ability to stick with the original Japanese soundtrack, it is vastly superior in terms of mood and storytelling.<br />The extras on this DVD are a mixed bag, but there are many of them.'Behind the Microphone' and 'The Art of Spirited Away' are both Disney efforts and lay on the cheese rather thick. There are a few points of interest in these documentaries regarding the process of translation, but at the end of the day they are both rather mundane fillers. Most annoying is the assertion in,'The Art of Spirited Away', that:<br /> &quot;People have said that the characters in Spirited Away are based on Japanese Myth, but they are actually based on people Miyazaki has met.&quot;<br />Whilst it may be true that the personalities and characteristics of the characters are based on real people, the characters themselves are 100% based on Shinto Buddhist mythology. Disney seem to be distancing themselves from this fact, perhaps in order to deter religious extremists who may look upon Buddhism in a negative light and give Disney a hard time.<br />The Nippon TV special is excellent. It provides a remarkable view into the workings of Ghibli Studios and the creation of the movie itself. It shows a corporate animation giant being run like a family business with remarkable success. I wonder if any Disney staff are jealous?<br />Stroyboard to Scene comparisons are another welcome addition. The only extra I would have like to see added would have been a commentary by Miyazaki. The TV special more than compensates though.<br />On the whole Disney are to be congratulated on presenting Spirited Away ('Sen to Chihiro' in Japan)  letterboxed and in its entireity, unlike Fox's apalling treatment of 'My Neighbour Totoro' . Just stick with the original soundtrack and you're in for a great time.<br />Oh yeah, the film itself....It's an absolute classic.
0156027321|5.0|It seems that a few of the negative reviews are from non-english speaking countries.  Maybe there is a problem in translation because I cannot see how anyone would find this book \\"mediocre\\" or \\"boring\\".  It is truly a wonderful book.  So much so, I wish I was back in a Literature class in college so I could have an intellectual discussion on it followed by a paper.  So many themes flash through this book it makes it hard to know where to start dissecting it.  An easy read that will keep your mind spinning for some time after.  A wonderful book.
B00005YXZH|5.0|1. You say you dislike Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. <br />Are you kidding me? This is easily one of the better rock albums ever. EVER. If you deny this fact, you are just scared away by the stink of popularity. This is a rock masterpiece. Our meaningless reviews, even the negative ones, are testament to this fact. YHF has received enough reviews on this site to rival the Beatles and Pink Floyd albums. This is classic, admit it. Your kids will be asking you if you listened to Wilco twenty years from now, and you will be like \\"Yeah, they were great. I met your mother at a Wilco concert.\\", all the while knowing you are lying through your teeth. This is good, your mindless debating over this album will not change that, or make anyone think you are trendy. Give up, submit to Wilco.
B000002HNR|5.0|Beauty in one of its purest forms...<BR>Just as simple as that.
B00008AWOD|4.0|Comparing this album to Placebo's previous albums is not a great idea. The basic elements are all the same; they have same band members, the same singer, and the same style as their old albums (with minor exceptions). So what is different about Placebo's new LP? Honestly, I don't know, but their music changed for the better and this is easily the best album they have ever made.<br />Do not take this to mean they scrapped all of the old elements that were good. I liked the old Placebo for the same reasons I love the new album. They just improved everything to a degree that is amazing. It is like they are a completely new band, but without changing anything. <br />This album is one of the better rock albums released this year. This three piece belts out up-tempo melodies that stick in your head like glue, and plays mellower ballads without sounding like it is forced. I do not want to sound overly praising, but this is album is a good one, well worth the listen. On a scale of one to ten, this gets somewhere between a 6 and 7. This is recommended listening for anyone.
B00008NG5V|5.0|This album has a lot more of Jack's mainstream kinda flow, much more songs like \\"Flake\\" and \\"Bubbletoes\\".  Anyone who prefers those songs to his slower mellow kind of songs will definitely appreciate Jack's upbeat energy that he pours into this album.  Buy it immediately as a requirement for any summer party!
B00005YW4H|5.0|This CD is undeniably good. Norah Jones beautiful singing voice and innovative collaborations with edgy jazz musicians such as blah blah balh. <br />Yes, this woman can sing her pants off, she deserves Grammy... as in ONE Grammy. There was too much innovative stuff that came out last year to lavish so much attention on one artist. I can think of about a millions artists that deserve a Grammy but will never even receive so much as a thumbs up from the star-making Juggernaut that is the recording industry. <br />Should you buy this? Yes. Does she deserve the praise of the entire world? Only if you believe what MTV tells you.
B00008H2LE|5.0|Linkin Park busts out of their 18 month creation period with a Phenomenal Sophomore Album. 13 Tracks of pure energy with no gaps. Each song literally has no seconds of space in between them which makes it that much better, getting you right into the next song, from the previous. The Enhanced CD also comes with a bonus DVD with the making of the Album, which gives you an awesome view of how this album was put together and how much dedication and work Linkin Park puts into their music. Guitar Tracking, Drum Tracking, Vocal Recording, everything is all on there. And also shows that the band has a little kid inside of them at times too. Here is the break down of the Album:<br />Foreword - a 13 second track with more history than you would think. Mike had a CD burner that would always glitch and mess up the CDs he would make during recording. So he just recorded himself, beating this CD burner with a metal bat, which is what you hear on the CD. It may sound stupid but it flows nicely into the next track making for a nice intro to....<br />Don't Stay - A Very nice, heavy track. All you heavy Rawkers would love this one, with Chester taking over with his exploding voice. Full of energy from beginning to End. <br />Somewhere I Belong - The first single off the new album. The intro is actually not what you think! Chester had a chord progression on an Acoustic Guitar that Mike really liked but thought it sounded too \\"folky.\\" so mike cut it up into pieces as 1-2-3-4 using a computer program named Pro Tools. Then ran it backwards, recorded it and then played it 4-3-2-1, recorded it again and then put it back as 1-2-3-4. So that's how you hear the swaying, sweeping sound as the intro. The chorus was written almost 40 times because Mike and Chester couldn't get it exactly right. Very Nice song, one of the most optimistic ones i must say. <br />Lying From You - Amazing song. I love it. Chester sings so hard in this song and will make for a very difficult, almost impossible cover song. The Riffs are great and clean. Very good for getting pumped up.<br />Hit the Floor - Almost like Hybrid Theory's \\"By Myself\\" Chester peaks the screaming and almost makes this song one of the Darkest on the Album. Excellent<br />Easier To Run - One of the softer songs on the Album. Chester shows his harmony in this song, collaborating with Mike. Rob also has some very complex drum patters on this song, adding to the Greatness.<br />Faint - The Second single, but if you want to hear the real song, buy the CD. The Radio version (in some areas) has been edited to leave out the best part, The Bridge. The Band really comes through in this one, using live strings and a Combination of Screaming and rapping to bring a great song to life.<br />Figure.09 - Excellent Song also. Joe (the DJ) starts the song with gentle Taps on his turntable and distortion pedal to create sort of a \\"Drum\\" effect. Another incorporation of Rapping and nice strong vocals. Add another song to the Vault!<br />Breaking The Habit - One that stands out from the album yet strangely fits in at the same time. Mike had wanted to write this song for about 6 years but could never get the vocals to be right, saying they'd be too cheesy or not good enough. Finally, he sat down one night and all of the lyrics came to him in 3 hours which he thought was very touching for him. The song is Phenomenal and really shows Chester's Wide range of Vocals. <br />From the Inside - I LOVE this song. It's very energetic and true to its lyrics. The beginning starts with scratching and then comes in with heavy Guitars. Mike and Chester collaborate excellently and Chester ends it with his strong voice. This song was actually written on 6/8 time. A different Path for LP to take. But thats what they do best. <br />Nobody's Listening - The Hip hop track of the Album, Mike takes over and adds his style to the song. The band at one point thought that this song felt \\"Separated\\" from the rest of Meteora so Brad added a muted guitarpart and Chester added his vocals to bring the track back into a Part of the album. <br />Session - The Famous instrumental track of Linkin Park albums, the whole band put their touches on this track to make it sound like it flows with the Album also. This track will also be features on the \\"Matrix: Reloaded\\" Soundtrack<br />Numb - The Title says it all. Which is what is leaves you, Numb. This track is simply AMAZING. Chester pushes his voice to its limit in the Bridge and his voice and the lyrics give me chills. It leaves you with the feeling that \\"this is the end of the album\\" and it sums up everything in one song, seeming like the band wants to blow you away with the last song and that is just what they do. <br />So In The End (no pun intended) this album will blow you away. With the songs short and sweet, it won't leave you with songs that you'll change halfway through. This band is the MOST dedicated Band I have ever seen and the best to their fans. Teens will appreciate the way that they can relate to the lyrics and everyone can see how much the band has improved and matured since Hybrid Theory. I promise, you won't be disappointed.
B00008J4P5|5.0|This is my first experience with The White Stripes.  But this is an excellent album.  Certainly one of the year's best.  Any fan on the first four Led Zep albums will like this one.  I hear Robert Plant on many of the songs here.  An earlier reviewer mentioned The White Stripes may be the Next Big Thing.  I think he may be right.
6304806442|5.0|i fell in love with this movie the first time i saw it. It's unbelievable in a creepy sort-of way. Yes, the toilet scene is disgusting and yes, their addiction is un-nerving and you want to hate the characters, but at the same time, you fall in love with them. The wit and acuity of the film and dialogue is amazing; it's impossible to say too much about this movie. Although it's not made for everyone, it's a great view on young un-hopefuls in the spinning circles of addiction and life. A GREAT film!
6300181464|5.0|Silent Running is at times idealistic, and at times dark. It is, however, always quirky. The ending (which I will not disclose here) sums up the strange and beautiful nature of this movie, as does the lilting theme song appropriately sung by Joan Baez. The beginning of the movie is perfection, and it continues through murder, hope, crisis, and renewal (not necessarily in that order) to the ending which is both heartrending and lovely. It is very definitely a film of its time, and if you can accept what that means you'll be able to bask in the atmosphere of this early 70s eco-film. Movies are, at their very core, a form of escapism. Watching Silent Running means spending some time inside an uncertain and always disarmingily gorgeous future space.
B000002HMH|3.0|I'm a long time Metallica fan, and I don't particularly care for this album.  I know a lot people don't like their more recent stuff because it isn't \\"heavy,\\" but that's not exactly what I don't like.  Sure, I wish they still kicked ... like they did in the 80's, but oh well.  Where Metallica have gone down hill is that their songs are so basic and uninteresting now.  There are a few great riffs and hooks on this, but just not enough.
B00006690G|5.0|Now i kno that i am a serious eminem fan, but the cd is still good. great. with a flaw or two. you should go out and buy it. i'll go song-by-song<br />Curtains Up (Intro) (7/10): I gave it a 7 because it ties good with...<br />White America (9/10): \\"AMERICA!!, WE LOVE YOU,\\" Em brings you into the world for a rising white rap star & his hatrid for america.............. \\"hahahaha, i'm just playin america\\"<br />Business (3/10): 3rd worst on the album. yea its kinda funny but hu cares? it does nothing for the album<br />Cleanin' Out My Closet (9/10): Great!

PERIOD.<br />Say Goodbye Hollywood (1/10): THE WORST ON THE ENTIRE ALBUM!<br />Drips (feat. Obie Trice) (8/10): Yes, it was taken off the clean version. no wonder why. every other word out of Obie Trice's mouth  is sexually related. the chorus is great, so is Em's verse. (oh yeah, the whole song is ABOUT sex)<br />Without Me (5/10): It's not as good as it was. it was a hit for a while, but you cant count on it being great forever. it gets boring.<br />Paul Rosenberg (6/10): I can't say anything. \\"em, its paul, listen, joel just called me and...\\"<br />Sing for the Moment (10/10): Ahhhh. an Aerosmith \\"Dream On\\" sample. the entire song blows almost the rest away except for...<br />Superman (feat. Dina Rae)(11/10)(yes, i kno thats more than 10): Boo-yah!! another Dina Rae song. the track 13 girl. another, less explicit sex song... \\"i no u want me baby, u no i want u too...\\"<br />Hailie's Song (7/10): A song dedicated to his daughter. half the song is sung. he didnt wanna put this song out, and it really wouldn't have made a difference.

Nate Dogg)(10/10): Another 10! This Queen-enhanced beat is great. and Nate Dogg never fails wit puttin dat great chorus in.<br />My Dad's Gone Crazy (feat. Hailie Jade)(8/10): Hahaha. no Em's dad hasn't gone crazy. hailie's dad did. Marsh & Hailie are so funny with this song. Hailie brings comedy to every song she is put in.<br />Curtains Close (8/10): The rumors. the speculation. but nothing. no Ken Kaniff. wait... isnt that...

006092988X|5.0|Even the weak small tree in the back yard can grow with only little sunlight. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith is a poignant novel that beautifully displays the themes of a growing family, often compared to a growing tree. The journeys of the Nolan family, all extensions included, are captured in five books, each documenting a period of their lives. Mostly, the focus is on Francie, the book beginning when she is age eleven in the Williamsburg slums of Brooklyn, though there are also records of her early years and even her birth. When Francie is born and looks as if she might not live too long, her mother Katie is pitied for the sickly baby and she replies: Who wants to die? Everything struggles to live. Look at that tree growing up there out of that grating. It gets no sun, and water only when it rains. Its growing out of sour earth. And its strong because its hard struggle to live makes it strong (93). Through this coming-of-age novel, Francie constantly exhibits her innermost thoughts concerning life, love, and her family from 1902 to 1919. <BR> After showing Brooklyn in the first book during the summer of 1912 as serene, and quoting Francies observations about the people who surround her, the path continues into lives of Francies parents Katie and Johnny, beginning when they first met, and delving into their families. The tales of Katies sisters Sissy, Evy, and Eliza and bits about Johnnys brothers Andy, Georgie, and Frankie are covered as well. Book Three begins when Francie is approximately age seven when the Nolan family moves to a new flat due to the accidents caused by an overwhelming amount of love from Sissy. Francie now begins a new adventure called school, which confronts her with both good and bad incidents. She painfully endures her beautiful fathers death, and sees her mothers newest pregnancy, which is Johnnys child. She recognizes her mothers apparent love for Neeley over her, and learns that upon ending middle school she must get her working papers. Francie yearns for education but realizes that she must work to help her family and keep them afloat. <BR> Book Four begins with Francie learning the ropes of factory life and to appreciate the necessity of work. Annie Laurie, Francies new sister, is born. She will not grow up in poverty as Francie and Neeley did, because of the nice, rich man who is courting Katie. Francie finds her first crush, her first love, her first heartbreak all in this section of the book. In Book Five Francie leaves the necessity of her life of work and prepares for a life of luxury thanks to Katies new husband. The novel ends with Francie bidding adieu to her old town, her old life, and her old self. <BR> Throughout my journey of reading A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, I both laughed and cried, and realized that there were aspects of this book that I liked and ones that I disliked. I liked knowing about all the people in the family, and knowing their emotions rather than merely knowing about Francie alone. I liked growing up with Francie, and observing her ups and downs. Though all of this possibly could not have been written in a shorter length, I felt that the book was too long and that it dragged at certain points. While I enjoyed the writing style of Betty Smith, I think that some of the vignettes were unnecessary.  I most liked the constant symbolism of the tree growing in the backyard. The tree hadnt died. A new tree had grown from the stump and its trunk had grown along the ground until it reached a place where there were no wash lines above it. Then it had started to grow towards the sky againIt lived! And nothing could destroy it (483).
B000089A06|3.0|The producers went to great efforts to make a slick porduction, with attention to the detail. I enjoyed the movie a lot, mainly due to the marvellous cast: Norton, Hopkins, Keitel, Fiennes! uau!
0440236738|3.0|The premise of the book held much promise, and the story was well told, but the amount of twists, turns, double and triple crosses started to get very tedious towards the end.  Not too difficult to follow, but after awhile you find yourself thinking, &quot;yeah, every day&quot; if you know what I mean.  I probably won't buy any other works by this author.
B000084T18|3.0|\\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\\" was as successful as it was for several reasons. One: 50's connection to Eminem's label \\"Shady Records\\" (which, as you know now, is more than just a connection). Two: His appearances on many DJ's mixtapes (DJ Lazy K, DJ Kay Slay, etc.). Three: The fact that he had been shot 9 times and survived. Four: Although minor, his 1999 single \\"How To Rob\\" that called out just about everyone in the industry (Prior to the release of this album, I can imagine some who anticipated it had hoped for more of these types of diss tracks.). Finally: Again minor, I believe he had a slight connection to 2pac before he died.<br />Of course, none of this really pertains to his music. It's all HYPE. 50 Cent's debut is nothing but hype. <br />Although the public reaction to singles like \\"In Tha Club\\" and \\"Wangsta\\" has been favorable, the fact of the matter is that 50 Cent is a horrible lyricist and rapper. I have listened to his older material, and his voice and flow was excellent. Here, it is easy to debate wheather his (supposed) shot in the mouth has affected his delivery and I can see why. His mumbling flow is pretty noticible here, and it hurts a lot of the material here. The subject matter in most places is pretty bad, and is in no way uplifting or original  (not necessesarily a bad thing, since it is intermittinly enjoyable). The other problem is his rhyming skills: Single-syllable flow, and nursery-rhyme structures accompanied by his weak flow kill any notion in the listener's mind that 50 Cent has any talent whatsoever. It shocks me that he says such things like, \\"My flow's been hot for so long\\" (\\"Patiently Waiting\\")! There are a few guest apppearences, most notably Eminem. Now, these days I am rather fed up with Em. He has quickly turned himself from a witty punchline lyricist to a depressed \\"middle finger to the critics and parents\\" clown with a good flow. But that aside, he does a good job here. Although the verses he spits on the two songs are tight, they simply don't belong. He EMBARASSSES 50 on \\"Patiently Waiting\\" (despite meritting him) with his multi-syllable flow. He is not a thug rapper like 50 and that may make his appearences on the album seem out-of-place, but it is enjoyable nonetheless.<br />The CD is extremely well produced. The beats on here sound rugged and some of the best I've heard in quite a while. However, there is something strange about how 50 decides to use them. He has to sing over most of them to get used to the track. Just listen.<br />Standouts: I liked \\"Heat\\" alot. It's one of the few times he flows decently, and the beat with a cocking and firing gun replaces the drum-loop. I've heard a lot of people who listened to the album say it's proof that Dr.Dre is falling off in his production skills, but I disagree. Another standout is \\"Patiently Waiting\\". It is discussed above a little, but an addition to the track is it's dark beat. Check it out. Next is the Ja-Rule diss track \\"Back Down\\". I'm sure most have heard the track, but if you haven't, it is quite funny. The beat (produced by D-12 member Kon Artis) is excellent, nuff said. Moving on to \\"What Up Gangsta\\", which is no doubt one of my favorite songs at the moment. A thumping bassline and drum-loop dominates the beat, as 50 spits some hard, tight lyrics. Basically what every other song should have. Finally the bonus tracks. \\"Wangsta\\" is the indirect Ja Rule-diss track. You really should have heard the track now. It grows on you. \\"Life's On the Line\\" is the only track that was recorded prior to his shooting, and is no doubt the best. Just listen to it. Trust me....<br />Conclusion: If you are into KRS-one, this is not for you.<br />overall rating: 2.6 stars (rounded to 3)

B000089RVX|5.0|I really, really love this CD.  I can't even pick a favorite song- I love them all!  Amy Lee has an amazing voice and the lyrics are excellent.  I was only disappointed with one thing- I downloaded their song &quot;Missing&quot; but it did not appear here.  That's too bad, but this is still something I would strongly recommend.  This is a very unique and talented group- if you're not familiar with them, you should be.
0688163173|5.0|This is a terrific book with a great twist at the end.<br />I plan to get Dennis Lehane's other books.  This is not your average mystery/thriller.  I literally couldn't put it down.  Buy it and enjoy!

0689859368|5.0|Nine-year-old Jared Grace is at a strange point in his life. His father has just left his family and he was nearly expelled from school after getting into a fight (he came out with a black eye, the other kid left with a broken nose). Also he doesn't seem to be good at anything like his intelligent animal obsessed twin brother Simon or his thirteen-year-old sister Mallory, a fencing expert. When the three of them and their mother move from the house they've grown up in to Spiderwick Manor, their crazy aunt's crumbling home, Jared is not too pleased. But strange things start to happen once Jared steps inside the door. A mysterious room is found and attacks are made on his family. Special posessions go missing and the blame is all placed on our hero. Jared knows that he must find the answers to all of these strange occurrences and he finds them in a book, a very strange book, a book on fairies.<br />In the past few years, children's literature has received many new solid novels and series. Some examples are Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events, Eoin Colfer's Artemis Fowl Series, Neil Gaiman's Coraline, and Harry Potter himself. Although I doubt the Spiderwick Chronicles will get as much publicity as these other books but that doesn't mean that it doesn't deserve some praise of it's own. The Field Guide is a tiny book, but it's filled with creativity and imagination, a great beginning to a series. It reads much like a cross between A Series of Unfortunate Events and Diane Wynne Jones's Chrestomanci Quartet with a spice of Coraline's creepiness. Jared is a great character, much like any nine year old. This is the first book in a series of five. The second book in the series, The Seeing Stone, is already out and I can't wait to read it!
0345423496|3.0|The book starts interestingly, with Poole being brougth back to life and feeling like a middle age barbarian would in our time. I also appreciated Clarke's perception that religion only hinders the progress of mankind and it will disppear as science advances. <BR>   So far so good, but as much as 2061, it disappoints as a sequence of the fantastic 2001 and 2010 books. Ingenious ideas such as the monolith, von-neumann machine and star-child were given little importance. The idea of virus attacking the monolith was dreadful! Machines interprets only the language they are built to support no matter how advanced they are, which makes implausible that a program designed on Earth would run in an alien machine and eventually destroy it!!
B00005UW9T|5.0|The story of the lost Romanov princess has become a legend in itself; captivating the interests of people worldwide. To mould such a story into an animated movie was certainly no easy task; but what directors Don Bluth and Gary Goldman have achieved is an unique masterpiece you cannot help marvel at. The Little Mermaid had re-incarnated animation in 1989 and the following years saw a saga of animated hits from the mouse. But after the record breaking `Lion King' and acclaimed `Pocahontas', Disney began to lose its iron grip at the box-office. The rather disappointing Hercules did not help to hype up the position at all. Fox's first animated motion picture possesses a beauty and splendor comparable in every way to major Disney hits like Beauty And The Beast and The Lion King.   <br />                                            It is dramatic yet spontaneous, humorous yet emotional; and although not historically very accurate, it indulges in a dramatic fictional narrative, combining an essence of traditional values and modern story-telling that give the movie a spectacular outlook. The visuals are extremely vibrant and poignant, with colorful spell-binding backgrounds in which are carefully blended the CGI sequences.  Stephen Flaherty's music is rich and deeply melodious. From the Broadway styled `Learn To Do It' to the Oscar nominated `Journey To The Past', the songs are indeed memorable and leave a lasting impression on your mind. The tune that lingers on and on is `Once Upon A December', its melody hauntingly beautiful and probing. And for those who love fast numbers, you will certainly adore the pop end title `At The Beginning' by Richard Marx and Donna Lewis. <br />                                   David Newman's score, although short, is simply one of the best to ever grace an animated movie; its emotional gravity so astoundingly deep and soul-searching that it makes you forget it is an animated movie you are watching. Newman was honored with his first AcademyAward nomination for Anastasia. As to why he did not win remains a big mystery to me. Anne Dudley's The Full Monty, which eventually won the best Musical Score in 1997, is at best tolerable and certainly pales before Anastasia's heavenly appeal.<br />                 Fox's voice cast comprises of renowned on-screen actors and actresses, who have delivered praiseworthy performances. Meg Ryan is enthusiastic, fiery and brings surprising life to the character of Anastasia . John Cusack portrays Dimitri, and his voice adds amazing warmth and glow to the lines of the male protagonist. Other talents include Kelsey Grammer, Hank Azaria, Christopher Lloyd, Bernadette Peters and Kirsten Dunst. The best role probably belongs to Angela Lansbury who puts excruciating depth in the character of Anastasia's grandma, the Dowager Empress Marie.<br />                                          The main highlight of the movie is its sentimental appeal, cleverly mixing the elements of heart, emotion, sacrifice and depth that is sure to conquer any romantic heart. I repeat, there are times which make you forget that it is an animated movie you are watching, not a real one. The re-union scene where the Empress Marie says \\"Oh Anastasia My Anastasia!\\" is voiced with such depth that it brings tears to the eyes. To imagine the joy of a woman who has lost her son and her whole family during a revolution, who has been hurt countless times by imposters, to finally know that her grandchild is still alive!                       <br />                       Fox's DVD offers a 1.33:1 pan and scan as well as a 2.35:1 widescreen picture. The anamorphic transfer looks very crisp and colorful. The Dolby digital 5.1 sound makes good use of surround, nicely highlighting the score and special effects. The special features offer an in-depth look at the making. Also included are a featurette, two trailors, two sing-alongs and a puzzle game.<br />                            An unique masterpiece, Anastasia hasmarvelous music and an excellent storyline which depicts two very strong women. The movie, though, is geared more at the mature audiences. Ten-year olds will hardly understand the emotional moments or the occasional verbal clashes between the two protagonists during the first half of the movie. I highly recommend it to people who truly appreciate artistic and emotional beauty. Anastasia stands as a classic to be cherished now and forever.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|This is one of my favourite movies. I love its sense of humor because it's not the usual in-your-face punchline or the over-done physical comedy. It's a smart comedy and Hugh Grant is the best actor for it.
0802130208|1.0|As your begin to read a book you almost envision what you read. In A Confederacy of DUNCES, by Toole, it is hard to keep envisioning. The characters bounce about as obliterated fools do as they live their lives in the poor area of New Orleans. Your eyes begin to close dreamily as his first character, Ignatius, gets a job as a hotdog vendor, only to shoot back open for a moment as he and his mother fight once this is over they dreamily close once more. Now Toole's characters do have potential to be something more but they don't. For instance: Ignatius is a 30 year old obese man who lives with his mother while they both live off of his dead father's saved meager income.  Ignatius is a smart man, or at least he has been to college, he could have had a job years and years ago yet he has never once had a single job. This 30-year-old man has been writing a book for 3 years. This 30 year old man acts like a 3 year old child, when he was asked to get a job to be able to pay for a drunken mistake he almost throws a hissy fit. The mistake was purely to blame for the two alcoholics driving, Ignatius and his mother Mrs. Riley.  They had both gone out and got themselves trashed then preceded to drive home. They crashed into a building and that's how the story really began.  Now everyone, it seems like, that the author mentions in the book he begins a little tangent about him or her that continues through out the entire book. They all sort of click in the end and even sometimes you see the connection in the middle of the book.  For instance: Patrolman Mancuso is the officer who found Mrs. Riley and Ignatius's car in shambles combined with a lovely hole in a wall. He also asks Mrs. Riley out on a date involving bowling. We then meet his sister, Santa, who Mrs. Riley really quite enjoys. Or even before that when Mrs. Riley and Ignatius went to drink they met at the bar Lana Lee, the owner of the bar and Darlene her employee. Lana Lee then hires a black man trying to stay out of thepolice's way, Jones. <BR>                 I mean it seems like the list could go on forever, and that's why I don't enjoy the book, it goes on and on and on. It has no point at all, this may be because Toole killed himself before finishing, and definitely does not stand out in my mind as being a book of merit. A novel of merit is a book that has deep meaning to you and will stay with you always. I have trouble remembering what I had just read in A Confederacy of DUNCES! The book showed me no deep and powerful meaning, however I believe it might be a different story if I were to read it in 20 years or so. I think that the book has too much to do with debt, families, and the lives of middle age persons that it is virtually impossible for us youngin's to truly enjoy it or even understand it.<BR>                  So on that note I would suggest this book to only those who have a knack for reading and the persistence of a buffalo on steroids, or to those above the age of 35. This book couldn't grab me even if I was covered in glue. Hearing from others in my class and of my age group I have also found that they don't enjoy it either. There is one advantage to this horrifyingly boring book and that is that it is short, 394 pages!!!! This is why we read it. And well I don't believe it was worth it. I give it a half a star.
B00008DDXC|3.0|Love the movie, but couldn't watch it on my computer.  Not too big a deal, but sometimes we like to take the laptop in the backyard and watch the movie outside.  Worked on Windows XP, but not Windows 2000 server machine for some reason...<br />Harder to use all the extras from the DVD without the computer.
0671015206|4.0|This book has cold number facts regarding who the real millionaires are.  It is very informative and it shows how disciplined one must be to truly accumulate wealth.  Real wealthy people aren't living how the media dipitcts them- for example, they buy american cars, not imported luxury cars.  This is their frame of mind.
B00004XMV6|5.0|Almost a hundred of 9 1/2 weeks have passed since this movie has become my favorite of all. It still is.<BR>It's 9 and a half weeks that John's relationship lasts with the most attractive Elizabeth. It's 9 and a half weeks of a true love experience Elizabeth and John have but it's Elizabeth who feels that true love as for John and his show off Wall Street man personality all this seems to be a true game. He plays up with Elizabeth's feelings up to the moment when he loses her forever and sadly it is then that John realises how much he really loved her too.<br />It's definitely not a porn movie, and if it includes erotic scenes so what? Don't we all make love that way when we are in love as badly as John and Elizabeth are? But people as people they always tend to see bad things before the good ones and in this movie there is not one single bad thing (it's just people have to say something different from others) excluding John's silly games with the love of his life.<br />Absolutely a must have movie.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|I first saw the movie in 1982 and did I cry my eyes out. I saw this movie three times in the theaters and I cryed each time. When the movie came out on video tape I bought it and played the tape over and over again and cryed each time. Now I own it                                                                                  on dvd and I still love it and I still cry watching it. this is a great movie and I still enjoy it.
0688156819|5.0|This book is amazing. I borrowed it from a friend, and I know I need to buy it. Tim Burton, who I'm admired for quite some time, has proven his genius. His wit is dry and twisted, but that's what's so special. This book has a range of emotions...All worth experiencing from Burton's point of view.
B00003CX5P|5.0|George Lucas realy nows how to make a good movie. He has done well with his star wars movies. This movie is one of his best. All of the star wars movies are great no dought about it. I seen this movie in the show about two times and I loved it. Now I own it on dvd and I watch it alout sence I have a surround sound system. This Movie is one of the best. I am not nocking the first three star wars movies at all because they are all good.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Twenty years, 200 image changes and 500 controversies since she started her career, Madonna does it again. She, unlike Michael Jackson, manages to stay relevant and produce good music at the same time.<BR>American Life could be called Music 2.0 - her collaborator on the CD is Mirwais, the French dance club wizard behind the best songs on Music.<BR>The songs on American Life repeat the formula on Music's best songs: Hyper club beats enhanced with electric and acoustic guitars and all manner of electronic sounds.<BR>The title track finds Madonna questioning everything she's worked for 20 years to attain - boatloads of money, matchless fame and so on. The perculating electro-funk beat and closing rap \\"I'm drinking in some Latte, I get a double shot-ay\\" make it a little piece of pop bliss.<BR>The true standout tracks are \\"Nobody Knows Me,\\" \\"I'm So Stupid\\" and \\"Hollywood.\\" Nobody Knows Me is a thumping dance-floor friendly rant about how everyone thinks they know Madge but don't have a clue.<BR>\\"I'm So Stupid\\" combines a grungy guitar riff with perfectly timed electro beats to illustrate how Madonna herself has been seduced by fame. A similar formula is at work in \\"Hollywood,\\" in which Madonna decries the \\"all that glitters isn't goal\\" truth of Hell-Lay (L.A. for the uninitiated.)<BR>Neo-disco Mother and Father finds Madonna still puzzled by her mother's death and both apologizing and crticizing her father at the same time.<BR>Madonna and Mirwais take the tempo down a notch on ballads \\"Nothing Fails\\" and \\"Easy Ride.\\" The CD also includes \\"Die Another Day\\" from the most recent James Bond movie.<BR>\\"American Life\\" builds on the successful formula from music: Madonna & Mirwais are a great combo. It's introspective without being obnoxiously preachy, and, as always with Lady M, makes you want to dance.<BR>Not quite on par with classics such as Like a Prayer or Erotica, it's every bit the equal - and probably better - than Music.
B000002KBA|5.0|In the year 1970, heavy metal was just beginning in its first stages of development. Black Sabbath's monumental debut blasted their audience with a new, heavy sound; Led Zeppelin rocked the blues harder than it had ever been rocked; but it was Deep Purple that combined the heaviness and the speed to form what we now know as heavy metal.<br />Look no further than the opening track, \\"Speed King\\". Then listen to anything else that came out in 1970. This song shows no mercy as it instantly blasts out of the speakers, with a fury, excitement, and sexual drive never before heard in rock music. The whole album is consistently furious (although the band definitely slows it down for much of the rest of the album).<br />Not to mention, of course, the purely awesome technical skill involved in the playing. In the epic \\"Child In Time\\", all the instruments run counterpoint harmonies on incredibly fast minor-scale riffs in the brilliant climax. Ritchie Blackmore, in particular, shines on this record. His guitar playing, although it would improve on subsequent releases, was even then simply awesome. He is my personal favorite guitarist of all time, although many would argue with my opinion. Jon Lord is a fine organist as well, working with Blackmore to incorporate subtle neo-classical elements into the music. Ian Gillan, of course, is the famed singer, although the production on this album makes his voice sound strangely shrill and distorted (this is not a huge problem, it's actually not that bad). Ian Paice, while not a particularly notable drummer, certainly drives the music forward, while also showing some ability to lay down the funky beats as well.<br />Every song on In Rock is a winner, my favorites being the mid-paced groove \\"Bloodsucker\\", the ferocious \\"Flight of the Rat\\", and the aforementioned \\"Child In Time\\". This, my friends, is where it ALL began...
B000002UAI|5.0|With \\"Beatles for Sale,\\" an album that it is agreed was extruded from four very tired geniuses after the whirlwind of '63-'64, the group started to make the moves that would eventually lead toward the pop-folk style of \\"Rubber Soul.\\"  There is no gainsaying the genius of the Beatles' first three albums and assorted singles from the Beatlemania period, but it's also fair to say that most of their original music of that time was more about craft than passion or personal statement.  This album, on the other hand, looks both backward and foreward, carrying a larger percentage than usual of superb cover versions of songs their heros made famous--especially Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly and Carl Perkins--but also looking forward with very unique and even disquieting songs, especially from John.  The opening trio of songs, \\"No Reply,\\" \\"I'm A Loser,\\" \\"Baby's in Black\\" contain lyrics of torment and depression, but are set in sturdy, melodic and somewhat innovative arrangements.  There are not many degrees of separation between these songs and songs like \\"In My Life,\\" or \\"I'm Only Sleeping.\\"  Indeed, this album also signifies the ascendance of John Lennon as the most important Beatle songwriter, a title he held at least through \\"Revolver.\\" If you love John Lennon, however, there is much to admire on this record in addition to his key compositions.<br />Most especially, you get one more opportunity to hear Lennon sing the heck out of an old rock and roll number, in this instance \\"Rock and Roll Music,\\" which gets the definitive treatment with a tonsil-shredding vocal performance fully the equal of \\"Twist and Shout,\\" \\"Bad Boy\\" or \\"Money (That's What I Want).\\"  The Beatles did so many things so well, it's easy to forget that their most important contribution might be the revival of rock and roll at a time when it was in danger of becoming lost in the mists of music trends.  These Lennon performances (and a few of Paul's too, like on this album's \\"Kansas City/Hey Hey Hey\\" and on \\"Long Tall Sally\\" which now appears on Past Masters Vol. I) are to be treasured as the sound of a young man picking up a lost art and making it fresh, and then carrying it forward to today.g Tall Sally\\" which now appears on Past Masters Vol. I) are to be treasured as the sound of a young man picking up a lost art and making it fresh, and then carrying it forward to today.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I watched the VHS version, so I don't know if there are other clues in the DVD features that I missed, but the key to understanding this film lies in reading the &quot;Philosophy of Time Travel&quot; by Roberta Sparrow posted on the Donnie Darko website.  This fictional (i.e. made-up by the movies creators) book states the assumptions that the movie's plot works off of. Specifically, the details of the parallel universe, time travel and the role of people in the parallel universe are explained.  After watching the movie and going through the web site, I watched the movie again and everything made sense.  It went from being &quot;good but confusing&quot; to &quot;brilliant.&quot;  What you come to realize is that everything in the movie, literally almost every conversation, is intimately but subtly linked to another and building to a final outcome.  If you walk away understanding the important role that Drew Barrymore has in the series of events (who at first watch seems insignificant) - which really is no more or no less important than any other character in the grand scheme of things - then it should all make sense.  All of the other themes such as teen alienation, pop culture, etc, provide commentary on the world while at the same time working to advance the plot.  An amazing movie.
B00005QK3W|3.0|I've been a McCartney fan from boom to bust. Even in the boom days his lyrics had little deep meaning, but they were part of an interesting musical collage. However, I can't say that anymore. It seems that since the 80's his lyrics have gradually become a distraction to the enjoyment of his music. This has come to a head now in the song &quot;Rinse the Raindrops&quot; on this album (mine also with different cover) where Paul repeats the same brief poem over the entire expanse of the 10 minute song. And it's not that the lyrics are so great in the first place. They would be appropriate in one verse or in a bridge, but over and over and overc Has anybody counted how many times he repeats this? <br />I really do hope for the best in Paul's writing, but he sounds too content on using what he thinks sounds cool at the time. I wonder how long he works on his lyrics. I wonder if he grows with them at all. He sounds like he barely ever gets beyond the rough draft stage. Anyway, I realize bad lyrics are rampant throughout the music industry but it is much more noticeable to me with Paul because his music, arrangement and melody are still among the best in HISTORY. In contrast to the lyrics, there are so many good sounds on this album! Paul, listen to some Dylan! Go a little deeper into your soul. I hope there's still something there for you!
B00007G207|3.0|After many years of wishing to see this longer version of Cinema Paradiso, I couldn't have been more dissapointed. Whomever it was that edited this film in the first place knew exactly what he was doing as all of the &quot;new material&quot; does nothing but hurt the innocence of most of the main characters and ultimately eliminate it's unique magic. My guess is most fans will watch the new version once and return to the original afterwards.
B00004YKUY|5.0|I love this album, but I have a gripe with everyone who claims that Journey is not Journey without Steve Perry.  Everyone has to realize that Journey was created by Neal Schon not Steve Perry.  Grant it, Steve Augeri is simliar in vocal style to Steve Perry, but if you want Steve Perry - then go buy one of his CDs and shut up.  If you want Journey, then sit down, buy this CD, and try to listen to where Neal and the boys are trying to take Journey.  This isn't meant to be an album with a Steve Perry clone.  This is a Journey album with a new frontman - Steve Augeri.  Stop comparing, and listen to this album for what it is - a new step in the ladder for Journey.<br />Every song seems to infect me emotionally.  Every melody, and every rhythm create a visual tapestry within my mind.  It's just incredible!  But, I could go on and on about how great the CD is.  But, that's not what I'm going to do.  This is an album for a Journey fan - not a Steve Perry fan.  If you want a Steve Perry album - then go out and buy his greatest hits.<br />(And one more note - for those who dog Steve Augeri, and knock him down for not hitting Steve Perry's notes - listen to Steve Perry now, and compare to Steve Perry from Infinity.  Steve Perry, live, can't even hit the notes that he used to.)
B00005JKPF|4.0|The first 'X-Men' wasn't so much good as it was anticipated. Fans wanted this movie, and while it wasn't exactly what they wanted they were grateful and held out hope for more and better sequels and spinoffs.<br /><br />'X-Men 2: X-Men United' doesn't disappoint. Brian Singer knew what worked and what didn't in the first film and made sure this one had the kinks worked out. Almost all the characters have enough screentime to get thier personalities across. Surprisingly, the character \\"Nightcrawler\\" comes off as both more capable and more sympathetic than his four-color counterpart.<br /><br />Ian McKellen once again gives an outstanding performance, managing at times to overshadow every other actor on screen with him... even Patrick Stewart, which is saying something. Stewart manages to have his own spotlioght moment however at the end, showing that even the most peaceful mutant can be pushed only so far.<br /><br />Knowing the books, I have a pretty good idea what the ending means in terms of what the next film will cover; I hope Singer & Co. are up to the challange.<br /> Someone mentioned spin-offs of the characters and other teams might be forthcoming. While I would welcome them, I'm still smarting from the 'New Mutants' nonsense on FOX (yes, I hate what FOX does to talent. Sue me). So we'll see...
B000002GQK|5.0|This CD is likely the least well-known of the classic 7 Moody Blues releases.  This CD is also likely the most progressive and experimental of the classic 7, which is saying a lot considering how well regarded \\"Days of Future Passed\\" is as one of the first, if not the first, rock concept albums, and one of the first progressive rock albums.<br /><br />As with most of The Moody Blues first 7 albums, this CD also has a concept, albeit a somewhat loose concept.  In this case, the concept is the evolution of man and his society, and whether and how that society might survive.  As you can imagine, the tone of the album is relatively downbeat and somber.<br /><br />The opening track is perhaps the most progressive Moodies track of any Moodies album, \\"Procession\\".  This song is nothing less than the encapsulation of the evolution of man from man's primate ancestors to today.  This song is one of those that have earned The Moody Blues comments such as heavy-handed, pretentious and overblown.  Certainly the song attempts to summarize our history with three words: desolation, creation and communication.  The music that goes with these three little words is nothing less than art, simple, building in complexity as the piece progresses until the last moments in the song when the song becomes crescendos of guitars, organs and drums, underscoring the complexity of modern life, leading into the next number.<br /><br />While the next song, \\"The Story in Your Eyes,\\" seems to try to dispel the downbeat opening, the lyrics have the stanza:<br /><br />But I'm frightened for your children<br />That the life that we are living is in vain<br />And the sunshine we've been waiting for<br />Will turn to rain<br /><br />These lyrics add to the general gloom of the opening number, and furthering the theme of the album, which is whether mankind will yet survive.  While the lyrics have their downbeat portions, the music is fast and is the song that is closest to mainstream rock on this album.  This song was also the one chosen to be the single released from this CD.<br /><br />The next song is one of Ray Thomas's mellow numbers, but again the lyrics include hints of a darker future:<br /><br />Wonder why we try so hard<br />Wonder why we try at all<br />You wonder why the world is turning around<br />When in the end it won't matter at all<br /><br />Before you get the feeling that you should just lie in bed for the rest of your life comes \\"Emily's Song,\\" which was written about a baby girl.  This song is again mellow, a fairy tale of song.  There is chamberlain and percussion to give a vaguely cheery lullaby feeling to this song.  The most charming theme is that by living through our children we gain a perspective on the world that we've lost as adults (so true!).  The song suggests that we can regain what we've lost by being with our children, and letting them pull us into their world.  Is it any wonder that grandparents like grandchildren?<br /><br />\\"After You Came\\" is a fascinating song when viewed in the perspective of previous Moodies albums.  The song seems to suggest that many of the otherworld lyrics from the previous Moodies albums were unrealistic, and the Moodies, as well as their listeners, needed to regain their earthly perspective.  This theme was even more explicitly captured in the lyrics of the next album, \\"Seventh Sojourn,\\" as the Moodies worked hard to undo the sometimes cult following they achieved due to their intensely spiritual earlier albums.<br /><br />Just when you think the album is heading somewhere upbeat comes \\"One More Time to Live\\", a reprise to the first song \\"Procession,\\" detailing the host of man's sins and emotions, trying succinctly to express all the things that man could think, and perhaps should think, but also perhaps realizing that the solution requires philosophies and determination that can not be revealed in a simple song.<br /><br />Before the album takes itself so seriously that you achieve a dire funk, \\"Niceto Be Here\\" gives us a fantasy to relieve the stress of thinking too deeply.  Ray Thomas has a penchant for creating songs like this one, which are one part childhood fantasy, one part philosophy, and one part longing for escape.  A cute and clever song that somehow fits.<br /><br />The last two songs on the CD seem to relate to each other, and though they are sung in a mellow, almost downbeat, fashion, the lyrics suggest a way out for mankind.<br /><br />\\"You Can Never Go Home\\" by Justin Hayward is full of soaring instruments and vocals, and tells us that we are another step toward the future.  The song is a love song, but it is a love song with dual meanings that fit into one person's love, and the meaning that love has for the future of man.<br /><br />\\"My Song\\" by Mike Pinder is a fitting conclusion to this album, and makes you wish the album would have gone on for another disk.  Mike sings:<br /><br />Where did I find all these words<br />Something inside me is burning<br />There's life on other worlds<br />Maybe they'll come to earth,<br />Helping man to find a way.<br /><br />Mike's other lyrics suggest that he is having a hard time telling us all his thoughts and concerns, and he's ready to take any help to sort it all out, even if it's those extraterrestrials that so many of us talked about in the late 60s and early 70s.<br /><br />This album has never been considered to be a \\"great\\" album.  Yet, the album tries to explain where mankind is, how we got here, and perhaps, where we might go.  Only a group like The Moody Blues could tackle such an impossible subject in a mere 40 minutes.

B00003XACV|5.0|This score to me is why scores are the most underrated part of movies.  This is a wonderfully beautiful score that makes the movie more powerful than the script even comes close to getting.  The score adds emotion to scenes that wasn't there.  The ending of American Beauty is a testament to Newmans mastery on display here, with any other score it could have come off as overly-manipulative and tear-jerking.  But instead, it comes off as profound and beautiful.  As Newman did with Road to Perdition, he saves Mendes many times from amateur hour sentimentality.  And for that alone, this score is worth owning.
6305922748|5.0|Nigel Tufnel, (clearly the brains behind Tap, since without him the band can only muster a \\"cozy\\" 10 minutes of material,) serves as idiot savant in this free form jazz exploration.  When deconstructing the sublime ennui of the band as they amble through North America's more selective auditoriums, one notes an existential transition in their perspective (often too much perspective.)  From their other-worldy travels during the Flower People period to their joint festival appearance with a puppet show, Spinal Tap demonstrates the resiliance that defines the human spirit.  Tufnel, in particular, is driven with a desire to always go one louder, with his amplifyer, his solos, and his backstage culinary demands.  I for one was particularly moved when Nige tells David, \\"do a good show,a'right?\\" after informing the band that Sex Farm was climbing the charts in Japan.  In that moment we see the transformation of the Id to the Superego, the lifting of priorites from just performing Tonight I'm Gonna Rock Ya (Tonight) to preserving their enduring friendship.  I found Tap to be a moving tribute to near-competance amidst a sea of retarded sexuality and bad poetry.
B000002E5J|5.0|Pies Descalzos contains Shakira's early hits..all of which are wonderfully written and use great melodies. This album is 100% Spanish and although I don't understand Spanish, I still loved every song on this CD!! You don't have to understand the lyrics to appreciate the talent Shakira has. (I actually heard her current release, Laundry Service...and then decided to buy THIS album after hearing it.)<br />Shakira uses variety in tempo and pitch when she sings. Some of her songs are fast while others are somewhat slow. Each song, however, demonstrates the fantasic voice of Shakira...a voice that once you hear it, you will forever love her!
0062502174|5.0|&quot;The Alchemist&quot; is a simply story of one shepherd journey to fulfill his dream of discovering treasure in the pyramids of Egypt. During the course of his journey, he encountered obstacles and successfully overcame each one of them. He soon discovered more about himself, and others around him. This motivational book encourages each and every one of us to pursue our dreams. Instead of standing by the sidelines, we should take action to achieve and discover our dreams. Others who stand by the sidelines will always be dreaming where else others who take action will be closer to achieving them. Paulo Coelho carefully combined the elements of dreams and magic to send this message to his readers and that is, we are in control of our actions and we are the only ones who can help ourselves discover our destinies. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about him/herself and life in general.
B00008WG3U|5.0|NOFX has really done a job on this album.  The political insight is thought provoking yet not overbearing. Even if you do not agree with them the music is good.
6304493681|5.0|This movie is set in the not to distant future, it is about a police officer who happens to be an android. The plot is deeply philisophical, as the android ponders her own existence. She contemplates if she is alive or in fact just a machine. This movie took the world animation festival by storm in 1996, and rightly so. Even big name directors like James Cameron (titanic) praised this film. The plot is smart and the animation is incredible. Even now seven years later the film still looks as good as anything else out there. The color is extremely vivid and the music is also done very well. For anyone out there looking to start a great anime collection, this should definitely be on your list of must haves.
B00008S2VH|4.0|I've read most of the reviews of the album and am shocked at the negative feedback that the album is receiving. <br />I have always been a huge fan of Madonna but I really didn't enjoy the synthetic sound of Ray of Light or Music. The simplicity of the album is one of its biggest draws. <br />There are some truly beautiful and simple songs on this album. Songs like &quot;Love Profusion&quot;, &quot;Nothing Fails&quot;, &quot;Intervention&quot;, and &quot;X-Static Process&quot; are stunning. <br />A must-have for lovers of the accoustic sound.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Ok Computer not only sounds great and it is very different from much that you would find out there, but it doesn't go to the point of making it so different that it is arrogant or \\"too much\\". The whole album flows beautifully, and the lyrics are poetic, and at the same time funny and witty. Some lines simply will leave you thinking for a while (dissapointed people/clinging onto bottles/and when it comes to/it is so, so dissapointing). It simply sucks you in. This album is a must for people that like alternative music.
0385504209|2.0|The minute I knew who the knight was, the &quot;orb&quot; was obvious, but I had to spend the next 50 pages reading about a &quot;Harvard professor&quot; and a police cryptolgist who were not readily able to figure it out. While that ought to be enough, I would also mention that the alleged right/left masculine/feminine equation is factually inaccurate.  This book has pretenses of being intellectual and clever, but the characters are shallow, the plot not unpredictable and the pretense somewhat outrageous.  I am not catholic so that aspect of it did not offend me. One might read Umberto Eco, Phillip Kerr or others instead.
B00008OLIC|5.0|Any Motley Crue fan knows that Dr. Feelgood is an incredible album and not just for the band. When it was released it became and still is one of if not the greatest rock and roll album to grace the music industry.

It becomes better than the best which I think is worth buying, don't you?

B00008H2LE|5.0|I ran out and purchased Linkin Park's newest release, Meteora, on it's release date.  As a huge fan of &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;, I was very doubtful that this CD would be able to pack as great a punch.  Thankfully, I was mistaken.  The amazing blend of classic Linkin Park rock and newer musical directions makes this the cd of the year, in my book.  I urge anybody who enjoyed Hybrid Theory (since this cd is nothing like the awful flop &quot;Reanimation&quot;) to get a copy of this cd as soon as possible and endulge in the beauty of Linkin Park's sophomore cd, which is the first I've heard to overtake their debut.

B00000K19E|5.0|It does indeed. It's not an Oscar drama film nor was it ever supposed to be, so play down this argument if you ever happen to hear one. Most likely, however, you'll hear compliments to the creators for a really outstanding job, for creating what has been considered by many as &quot;the ultimate sci/fi movie&quot; before, but that sadly could hardly be ever seen. You know what a good movie should be like, you can feel it, but all movies that intend to be it usually fail and only few get to achieve this state of near perfection. These few are remembered and referenced for a very long time and Matrix is one such movie in its genre. Chances of you liking it? - 99%, leaving that 1% for somewhat twisted people who like that nobody likes and hate what everyone likes.
6300214826|4.0|The film has a very dark atmosphere throughout it. The only flaw is that there were many un-necessary scenes and the movie could have been much better without them. There was only one major battle, and that was near the beginning of the movie. The action in the battle was fantastic. But where's the rest of the action? Some parts in the movie were really boring, I kept waiting for something to happen, and it eventually did. In my opinion, this is just an average, or slighty above average War movie.<br />Score - B
B00000K19E|5.0|It does indeed. It's not an Oscar drama film nor was it ever supposed to be, so play down this argument if you ever happen to hear one. Most likely, however, you'll hear compliments to the creators for a really outstanding job, for creating what has been considered by many as &quot;the ultimate sci/fi movie&quot; before, but that sadly could hardly be ever seen. You know what a good movie should be like, you can feel it, but all movies that intend to be it usually fail and only few get to achieve this state of near perfection. These few are remembered and referenced for a very long time and Matrix is one such movie in its genre. Chances of you liking it? - 99%, leaving that 1% for somewhat twisted people who like that nobody likes and hate what everyone likes.<br />Great production values, great acting, great plot. This movie hardly has any serious flaws worth mentioning. The movie is dynamic and has plenty of tense moments, well crafted indeed.<br />You most certainly know the story by now, so to keep it short: A programmer for a big company (Keanu Reeves) and also a hacker in free time is troubled by a feeling that there is something terribly wrong with the entire world that sorrounds him, a feeling that would soon grow into reality as he discovers with the help of underground rebels (that the entire world is nothing more than a sophisticated setup by high-tech AI. Moment at which struggle against machines for human freedom starts.<br />Watch it and you'll most certainly love it, that is if you mature enough to understand everything what happens on-screen.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|What a wonderful collection of songs!  From the rocking 'Murrow Turning Over in His Grave' and 'Miranda' to the more laid back but no less captivating 'Thrown Down', 'What's the World Coming To', and 'Bleed to Love Her', to the wonderful 'Red Rover' song sketch with guitar to die for -- it's all great!  Some people have complained the guitar solos are self-indulgent -- I disagree.  For those of us sick of what's on the radio and dying for some guitar rock, they bring great big smiles to our faces!  Guitar solos have their place, and they're not overdone on this CD -- they're just right.  A+

B00005JLRT|4.0|...This is a good quality movie with a cast who have been together for ten years.  The storyline is very good with all the i's dotted and all the t's crossed.  As this is the last Trek movie with the Next Generation cast they had to make sure that every story point over the past 10 years had been tied up nicely.  They got Data to reach his humanity by sacrificing himself for his friends as Spock did in Star Trek 2, they got Deanna and Will Riker married (finally!) and they got every-one else to move on with their lives so that they were no longer together on-board the Enterprise.
B00005KHEU|3.0|&quot;Discovery&quot; was the last ELO album released in the 1970s, which is fitting because an obvious disco influence had set in with the dancefloor ready &quot;Don't Bring Me Down.&quot;  The other change was that the band was reduced in size from seven memebers to just a quartet, streamlining their sound a bit.  As with any ELO effort, however, leader Jeff Lynne's songwriting holds the key to success, and this time out he came up with a very strangely mixed bag.<br />The high points on the album soar.  In addition to &quot;Down,&quot; also first rate are &quot;Shine a Little Love on My Live,&quot; the synthesizer heavy &quot;Confusion,&quot; and the catchy &quot;Last Train to London.&quot;  All are among the best ELO songs ever recorded.  They are planted, however, among filler material that ranges from bland (&quot;Midnight Blue&quot;) to truly awful (&quot;The Diary of Horace Wimp.&quot;)  The expanded CD version of the album contains three demos of songs that didn't originally make the cut as well as new liner notes from Lynne.<br />Overall, a wildly uneven album with some soaring highs and plummeting lows.  Don't Bring Me Down--indeed!
B00005JLD4|5.0|While I knew that white Austrailians had difficulties with their dealings with the Aboriginal peoples just as we in the U.S. have had with the many Native tribes I had no idea it had lasted so long.  Now I have to do some research on when we USians stopped taking children away from parents.  This is an excellent cultural consciousness film and a good story too.  The extra documentary of the filming process is also very well done.  The children who made this film were enchanting. I am going to buy another copy for my personal collection.
0679735909|2.0|I bought this book after listening to a good friend rave about it, and continually hearing Byatt's name pop up in favorable reviews. Unfortunately, I could just never get into the story. While I thought the premise was interesting, the plodding story bored me to the extent that it took me about three months to finally finish the book - I kept putting it down for extended periods of time.<br />Interestingly, the parts I really enjoyed were the poetry and letters by &quot;Ash&quot; and &quot;LaMotte&quot;. I was very impressed by Byatt's ability to change tone enough to convince me another voice was there. I suppose that on an intellectual level I appreciated the skill, but I just did not enjoy reading the novel. By the end, I didn't care much about what happened to the characters - although the postscript was quite poignant.<br />If you want to Appreciate the Literature, dive in. If you want to enjoy the plot and find out what happens, rent the movie.
0679745203|5.0|Three people. Strangers. Together at a time when the Second World War is on its end. Shattered. Battered lives. In an Italian Villa - trying to reconstruct of all thats left, with the help of a burnt English Patient in a room upstairs...with a past like all of us...<br />I loved this book right from the word &quot;GO&quot;. No book has enchanted me this way in months now. The English Patient is a treat for the soul. Michael Ondaatje has created a masterpiece in its own right. Soulful, Poetic and so Real. Stories that come to life. Dreams that exhale memories of a different land. All lost. Souls in transit. That is the theme of this magnificient novel that enthralled me so much....Love, Betrayal, Passion and above all a story of the Human Heart and Compassion. <br />A must must read for everyone who loves a good book...
B00008DDXC|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the HP books, and in spite of the criticism I have thoroughly enjoyed the movies. CoS is better in pretty much all respects than Sorcerer's Stone: the kids have matured noticeably as actors, and look much more relaxed and natural; there was some fun with special effects; and the screenplay took a bit of artistic liberty and branched out from the book this time around. With a force like Harry Potter it can be dangerous to change anything at all for fear of alienating the fans, but this movie did a great job of capturing the spirit of the books without turning into a highlights film - a common criticism of Sorcerer's Stone.<br />The DVD extras are fun here too - I especially loved the cast interviews where we got to see the kids out of character, and learn what the adults think about their young costars. My one criticism is that there is no feature-length commentary (nor was there in the first movie). I would be very interested to hear the thoughts some of the established actors involved, the director, or Rowling herself.<br />Overall, this may not be Oscar material, but it's a perfect companion to the books and makes me love the series more.
0345457684|5.0|I am an avid reader of science fiction books and only picked this one up on a whim.  I am usually into hard scifi with a focus on technology, this delivers some of that but also much more.<br />There is a profound philisophical level to this book.  In this story the nature of humanity is only tentativly tied to the body.  This is a story to continually keep you thinking, as such I would recomend it to anyone.  I am also a reader really into science and found this book very intriguing on that level as well.  I was also new to the detective element of the story.  This kept me glued to the book when I should have been doing other things, and the way that the author brings together all of the unique elements  together at the end was very satisfying.  I am now looking into this authors other works!
B000089RVX|3.0|I just heard about Evanescence about a month ago, and I was hooked.  The album wasn't out yet, so I got my hands on as much of their work as possible, including some of their stuff from their last album, Origin (it's no longer in print, in case you're wondering).  That album blew me away - musical and lyrical talent, great variety; it was the album I had always wanted to round out my collection.<br />Then I bought Fallen.<br />Now, don't get me wrong: Fallen is still a decent album, but it pales in comparison to Origin.  The music in some places seems repetitive, in others the track has been rearranged from its original version in such a way that what once fit no longer does (Imaginary's bridge comes to mind - it used to be the intro).  It seems like they tried to be more hardcore without trying as hard.  Perhaps the transfer from indie to mainstream was a bit disorienting.  In any case, Fallen shines brighter than anything in some places (like Tourniquet and Bring Me to Life), and is as dull as a puddle of mud in others.

1563899426|2.0|Wizard magazine has been hailing this comic as fresh and exciting for well over a year and I waited for the graphic novel to arrive with no small measure of anticipation. Sadly, hype is not the same as quality.<br />The story is basically your average whodunnit with the twist coming from the fact that it takes place in a community of exiled characters from assorted fairy tales and works of fiction. Snow White's wild child sister has gone missing, her apartment awash with blood and painted with the ominous warning of 'no more happily ever after', and it's up to Detective Wolf to solve the crime before the annual Remembrance day. Why the deadline? I have no idea. And that it is only one of the many perplexing holes in the story. <br />The overlying problem is the length; this would have made a taut four-issue miniseries but it's been inexplicably stretched into five. Because of this, there are pages of lackluster filler featuring cameos of other literary characters for no point other then to try and be clever and edgy but succeeding only in its abilty to be crude and childish. Instead of getting a good chuckle out of seeing a modern Cinderella or Pinocchio you're struck more by the fact that Willingham writes them with exactly the same voice. Yes, it's funny seeing people who've been Disneyfied cursing, but only the first time around. <br />Snow White has a chip on her shoulder the size of an ogre and when she isn't tearing into someone she's crying about what might have happened to her sibling. That's it. That's her character for the whole affair. Everybody else is written with about the same voice, always more than slightly bitter and always ready with a witty remark. Willingham has all of the literary world to play with but doesn't take advantage of any of it aside from character names and a few story details that makes the comic feel like a cheap gimmick. <br />As things progress the story only further unravels. Dialogue de-evolves into random word ballons laced with profanity and almost the whole final issue is nothing but Bigby giving an explanation of the crime that had already been solved in the previous issue. The last few panels try to shoehorn in a romance angle but because interactions between Snow and Bigby haven't evolved at all over the course of the story- in the few places where they haven't been completely abandoned in favor of showcasing another 'hip' fairy tale re-creation- it just doesn't work. <br />The art is near flawless. The painted covers are beautiful sendups to the old poster-painted dimestore detective novels and the interiors are lovingly rendered with storybook flourishes and the occasional background object that's a little wink at the audience- three chairs in Old King Cole's apartment with three fiddles waiting on them is the one that immediately springs to mind. There's a bonus prose story by Willingham included as an extra accompanied by his own illustrations which suggest where his real talent lies.<br />For a much better look at fantasy and reality existing side by side in the city, pick up one of the Aria or Sandman graphic novels instead; their authors can weave webs out of even the most obscurely gossamer strands of myth and magic. This prefers to strive valiantly in the direction of a hardboiled detective tale but is little more than slightly poached. Two and a half stars for the art and the novelty but you'll come away with little else.
0375414053|4.0|After reading depressing novels in English, I read this book over a long weekend and I found it a great book for light reading. I love her to do lists (did she ever get her highlights re-done?) and how she gets herself publicly embarassed. Everything was just great except that I found the ending rather disappointing. For most parts, she is the perfect role model for every woman, including those who do not have a job!
0385504209|1.0|I'd heard about this book from many reputable sources and was looking forward to diving into what I hoped would be an intelligent thriller.  What I discovered was a trite and predictable novel offering little suspense or insight into its subject -- even the pacing was forced.  Perhaps my expectations were too high, but this wasn't even a decent read.  I just don't understand the hype.
B00005JKDR|4.0|Monsters, Inc. is a good film. The DVD however lacks special features that other DVD's have. When you play the movie there is an option of Widescreen and Fullscreen so that is nice. I watched it in Widescreen. This film is great for kids and even adults. The movie is funny. If you liked Toy Story or Toy Story 2 you MUST see this movie.
B0000797IO|4.0|A wonderful and thoughtful film.  Although Jennifer Aniston is the &quot;name&quot; on the box, this is, in reality, a very strong ensemble piece, with each actor bringing great things to their characters, no matter how little time we see them on screen.  The casting is brilliant all the way around.  This is a touching story about average people, which is what makes it so powerful.  As viewers, we can recognize ourselves and our loved ones in the characters.  In a market saturated by simplistic &quot;good guy&quot; &quot;bad guy&quot; sterotypes, this script and film encourage us, as the audience, to really THINK and to consider the multi-faceted emotions, decisions, complications, and actions that make us human.  We are able to see our own strenghths and faults inthe characters as they evolve; we are able to empathise because we relate to the dillemas in whch the characters find themselves.  This script is wonderful, and obviously owes its inspiration to John Steinbeck's little-known play &quot;Burning Bright&quot;.  &quot;The Good Girl&quot; does a wonderful job giving Steinbeck's play a modern edge, and makes it truly accessible for the viewing audience.  I highly recommend this film for anyone looking for a thought-provoking and enjoyable movie.  If you're looking for brain candy, this is not the one.
B00005JKZ3|5.0|This by far a Five Star Movie. I loved this movie, I saw it the day it came out. The ending is 100% funny. The movie is packed with action, adventure, and comedy. It is an amazing movie that everyone should see.
0553274503|4.0|\\"Flowers for Algernon\\" is the story of Charlie, a mentally retarded young man whose intelligence is dramatically enhanced by an experimental surgery.  He discovers the rewards of knowledge and learning, but he also learns about the cruelty of those around him - including his own family and friends - and his ultimate solitude as both an \\"idiot\\" and a genius.  <br />\\"Flowers for Algernon\\" is competently written and assembled, nearly seamless in the rise and fall of its story.  The diary format is well-executed, and Charlie's changing intelligence is aptly demonstrated in his writing.  The prose is honest and the story is unpretentious, holding the reader's attention without resorting to flashiness in either plot or style.  <br />The book's flaw is its excessive quietness.  The author leaves the story to tell itself, and in so doing he deprives it of some of its power.  The knife strikes true, but the final twist - best wrought by a well-placed phrase, a carefully articulated closing line, attention to the beginning of the book and the end - is left unturned, and the reader walks away too lightly, too unmarred.
B000065U1N|4.0|Black Hawk Down is an excellent movie that everyone should see. The only reason why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 was because in some parts of the movie it felt like it was just dragging on and on.
B00009M6VJ|5.0|Although,the critics did not like this movie,that just proves that not all xritics should speak for the movie going public!<BR>I really loved this film.Great personal political film without making it seem so boringly political.Kevin Spacey is wonderful as a brillent UT professor who is an advocate for saving death penelty inmates from well...death.His partner in crime is a wonderful Laura Linney who is more passionate in her goal to abolish the death penelty.Kevin Spacey finds himself accused of Rape and Murder and with 3 days left to live.Kate Winslet is the reporter that gets sucked into his story.Kate Winslet is by far the best asset to the film.It is wonderful to see her just use her amazing talent in jeans and without a corset or taking her clothes off!<BR>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

B0000024U8|5.0|Sure it is mired in 1968. Would you expect that an album(vinyl)be made to today's standards? I bought this when it first came out on vinyl and rebought it on CD when I saw it. It gives the raw and spontaneous art for which much of today's music is lacking. Mike Bloomfield was a legend and this album shows him in great form. It also gives a portrait of Stills as he was backed up by musicians he was unfamiliar with. Let the album be what it is and not what you would like it to be. Listen and enjoy great musicians enjoying the music and not worrying about polish.
B000060P79|5.0|Like, my dad said this isn't \\"real punk rock\\" and he played me some weird scary music that was just totally wack.

That's what my dad listened to in the caveman days or something, LOL. <BR>Besides, those bands looked all ugly and gross, like they should go on extreme makeovers. I'd like totally never go out with any of them. And if it's not on TRL, it must suck. Like, obviously. (PS-I love you, Carson!!!)

0944379044|4.0|The edition of MEIN KAMPF I am reviewing here is the Murphy translation, different from the Manaheim translation which can be purchased in most book stores.  It has this grainy, purple-colored picture of Hitler on the front in a Nazi uniform, and the spine is bright yellow with the title written in massive red letters.  Most of the people who condemn this book so harshly probably did not read it, and have only a superficial, media-produced idea of what National Socialism/Nazism was all-about.  Ho-hum--So self-righteous, so sanctimonious.<br />The style of MEIN KAMPF is very drawn out and highly technical and detailed, presented in the form of an autiobiographical, philosphical, political, social and quasi-spiritual diatribe.  The prevailing theme of much of the first part is Hitler's frustration with the military alliance between Germany and Austria-Hungary.  He felt that the Germans should all live in one country, rather than there being a Germany and an empire ruled by Germans (the Austro-Hungarian Empire) over various ethnic groups in Eastern Europe.  I don't consider myself any kind authority on this period of time in the late 19th and early 20th century in central Europe, but some type of understanding of the political structure in place in Austria-Hungary and Germany is necessary to understand what Hitler is talking about, otherwise it will just seem like endless rambling.  Hitler writes about his expiriences in WWI, and praises the heroism of the German army in the conflict.  Germany not only held off both Britain and France on the Western Front, but was also free to battle at will with its enemies on the east and south, and (until 1918 before Marxist inspired workers' strikes), maintain the upper hand.  Hitler analyzes the use of propaganda between the two sides and concludes that the Allies had the upper hand in influencing morale for their cause.  Britain was especially successful in portraying the Germans as the 'Huns' who committed terrible atrocites sothat the Allied troops would not be as shocked going into the war as the German soldiers were, whose propaganda portrayed the Allies as silly weaklings, which was obviously not true.  Hitler understood well the workings of propaganda and how it can be used as a soft-core form of government mind-control.  There is nothing different from Hitler's description and use of it and how it is used by the news and entertainment media in America today.<br />There are many anti-Jewish statements strewn throughout MEIN KAMPF, but they are not so much to be as shocking as many would think.   The 'anti-Semitism' is more assumed than explained, but the explanation involves the Nazi theory of a three-tiered racial makup of mankind which determines human interaction between cultural and religious groups.  The \\"founders of culture\\" are the mythical Aryans.  All ancient cultural, religious and other developments can be traced to them, even though Hitler never explains who they are, or how they could be related to Germans.  The \\"preservers of culture\\" are those who got culture from the Aryans, but stagnated after the Aryans interbreeded with those of lesser racial stock.  The only apparent \\"preservers of culture\\" that Hitler mentions here are the Japanese.  The Jews are the \\"destroyers of culture.\\"  Hitler criticizes them for using their religion to justify a racial-preservation group tactic.  Hitler does not cite any sources as to where he got this information, and MEIN KAMPF generally relies on the readers' percieved, innate, subjective insight regarding racial and social issues.  Throughout are descriptions of the state controlled eugenic social policies that would be in place once the Nazis gained power in Germany.<br />The last third or so of the book is dedicated to retelling the story of the National Socialist Movement and especially Hitler's personal perspectives and recollections on it.  Highlited are the Nazi organizational sturcture and its struggles against the Marxists.

I did like the first film, but I have to tell you that X2 SURPASSES the first film in action and story and character development.  Everybody can tell you about the plot.  What I can tell you is that it is a fantastic film that flew by in a matter of what seemed like minutes (even tho it is over 2 hours long).  I will see it again that's for sure.

B00006LLNU|3.0|If you are in the mood to be lulled by beautiful, slow songs that feel more like a constant &quot;drone&quot; overwhelming you with emotion then you should try these guys out. As far as musicianship goes, I wouldn't give these guys too much praise but the originality of their material is what matters. Most songs are rather long and never go anywhere. The same drum pattern stays constant in one song, for the entire 9 minutes! It is gorgeous music, don't get me wrong. If you want to be relaxed and whisked away into your dreams then this is a great cd. I made the mistake of listening to it while I was driving!! bad idea..but buying this cd is a good idea.

630521610X|5.0|&quot;Scream&quot; should definately not be considered merely another &quot;slasher&quot; movie. It's very clever. I think it is a smart mix of horror, suspense, and black humor. It's smart the way the characters in the film refer to past horror movies, such as &quot;Halloween&quot;, &quot;Psycho&quot;, and &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;. Good twist at the end. Great acting and scarily entertaining. &quot;Scream&quot; is a great movie to watch if you want a good scare. What I really liked about this film (besides the acting and down-right scary scenes) was the intelligent jokes aimed at horror-movie cliches, although some of them seem to be present in this film. This movie, however, does have a fairly large amount of blood, and should not be viewed by younger children. More for teens and adults (who don't have TOO weak a stomach)

Much better than I thought it was going to be and pretty funny in spots.  I was impressed with Reese Witherspoon in Election and really liked her here, too.  She seems to be a very good comic actress and I never realized she looked so good in a bikini--YOW! BABY'S ALL GROWNSED UP!

B00008AWOD|4.0|The Placebo lads are back with a new album on a new label.  While I do enjoy the album, I think it is a slight step backward from the momentum they were building with the previous discs.  All in all, well worth it.  If nothing else, these songs should be intense in their life forms.
B000088E6D|5.0|I've heard it all, from techno to pop to country to rock and roll and nothing can play the way that Michael Buble plays.  The old standards prove time and again to be a breeding ground for fresh voices and his is wonderful.<BR>I originally bought this CD after hearing him perform Moondance on the Late Late Show With Craig Kilborn.  And From The Moment I played it and heard him sing Fever until the end with an appropriately titled That's All I was hooked - and still am.  This is truly a great CD that'll have you singing along with it from day one and it comes with my highest recommendation!!!
B000002UJQ|5.0|If just for &quot;Subterranean...&quot; and &quot;Let Down,&quot; this album is worth buying and keeping.  But several other tracks are great, too.  Still one of the most unique--but good--sounds I've heard.  Anyone can be unique.  To be unique and awesome--that's a feat bands like Cocteau Twins achieved over and over.  And Radiohead has done it with several songs--let's hope they don't lose it.
B000021XR5|3.0|No. 4 is the Stone Temple Pilots most diverse album to date and ends up being a bit of a mixed bag, much like all thier albums. No. 4 has elements from all of thier 3 previous albums, so if you're expecting a full on hard rock album from beginning to end like Core you will be sorely dissapointed. Besides, i feel the harder tracks on No. 4 such as \\"Down\\", \\"No way out\\" and \\"Heaven & Hotrods\\" are forced and uninspired filler solely put on the album to reinforce thier hard rock/grunge image. It's the quieter moments on No. 4 which standout. Thier is nothing wrong with a good pop rock song like \\"sour girl\\" or a slow dreamy ballad like \\"Atlanta\\", which STP seems to have a knack for. \\"Sex & Violence\\" and \\"MC5\\" are also good catchy pumpin rockers that keep the energy up. The rest of the songs have some good ideas but don't seem fully sought out. Overall the album is a little rushed. I beleive STP will be remembered as a great singles band of the 90s rather than a band that released consistent classic albums.
6303614493|5.0|What an excellent movie. I love it just as much now as I did when I was 11 yrs old. Today in particular I searched for it on DVD because I wanted to buy it and I was quite disappointed when I saw that it wasn't available on DVD. What a shocker that was since this movie is, in my opinion, one of the best children's movies of it's time. So hopefully sometime soon the production company will realize this and make start offering it on DVD.
B00006M183|4.0|Pearl Jam's seventh studio album Riot Act is a blessing. There are no big riffing anthems here, just a solid collection of mature well crafted rock songs, more consistent than Binaural. That may sound boring to some but Pearl Jam's sound is so timeless and classic in a time when rock music is so faceless and pedestrian. Riot Act doesnt take any big leaps in new directions, but everything still manages to sound fresh. &quot;Cant keep&quot; is a haunting opener with it's spacey atmosphere. &quot;Love boat captian&quot; is a heartfelt rock ballad dedicated to the people who tragically died at that concert in Europe. Other standouts include the dark love song &quot;You are&quot;, one of many great Matt Cameron contributions. &quot;Green Disease&quot; which has a new wave/punk feel to it and &quot;All or none&quot; which is a breathtaking ballad to end the album. What i love about Pearl Jam is while thier fan base has diminished over the years, they havent changed a bit, they just continue to do what they love, make good music and tour for thier true fans.
B000000OAL|5.0|The boys had officially decided to call themselves Queen (under the forceful persuasion of Freddie Mercury) by 1971, after finally choosing the bassist they wanted (John Deacon), and come 1972, they had completed and recorded most of the tracks to this album (though the album wouldn't initially be released until 1973.) Musically speaking, the unique characteristics of (70s) Queen (a/k/a \\"The Queen sound\\") that many came to know (e.g. the opera-rock, the outlandish whimsy, the strange juxtapositions of gender-bending/vaudeville/opera/metal) CAN be heard here, just in rawer, unpolished and underdeveloped terms. But other than that, the album is mostly a smorgasbord of classic heavy metal, psychedelia and progressive rock.<br />But, despite it being a work in progress (for Queen, anyway), the album is strong and solid on it's own. That's probably one of the most [standard] statements ever made, but for the first time, I'm tempted to apply it here. I really think if Queen were not to evolve or make another album after this, they still would have been recognized as having sophisticated musical talent - whether by critics (puh!) or by other musicians. Ironically, that's one of the few 'gifts' I noticed Queen to possess: not totally reaching their peak in a certain setting, yet what they come up with, seems to be strong in character and golden on it's own. \\"Keep Yourself Alive\\" was the 'somewhat' popular track on here, as Brian May in particular is playing some crunchy, yet sophisticated licks on his self-made guitar. I agree with some of the reviewers below who said that after listening to this (as well as the rest of the album), one gets a sense that Queen possessed a certain overwhelming, indescribable intensity and talent that was WAY ahead of it's time - and this was only their debut - an album that only gave hints of what would blossom on later efforts. Freddie Mercury (unsurprisingly) gave a wonderfully forceful vocal performance on here. \\"Doing All Right\\" was originally co-written by then vocalist Tim Staffel (Note: during that time, the band was called Smile, not Queen.) Anyway, the song progresses nicely from soft, wistful guitar passage-filled verses, which feature ethereal and angelic falsettos from Freddie Mercury, leading into the chorus' featuring summery vocal harmonies, which are then later followed by unexpected guitar blasts from Brian May.<br />Elsewhere, \\"Great King Rat\\" opens up with Brian May's trademark snaky guitar overdubs. The track features some pretty bold and daring lyrics (which were not uncommon with Queen) revolving around [explicit] metaphors, while \\"My Fairy King\\" gives subtle glimpses of the bizarreness that would be found in progressive rock tracks such as \\"The March Of The Black Queen,\\" and later \\"Bohemian Rhapsody.\\" Features some pretty bizarre, and arty lyrics, which feature many references to astrology and mythology, and delivered in Freddie Mercury's trademark seductive, gender-bending, Divaesque vocals.<br />\\"Liar\\" seems to get much praise by many of the reviewers here, and it's hard for me to disagree. A theatrical, almost operatic track, it manages to combine convincing, thought-provoking lyrics, intelligent dynamics and shifting in musical atmospherics, and Freddie Mercury in particular is raving it up on his vocals - shifting effortlessly from plaintive stylings, to genre-bending, oversexed moans, to forceful, passionate pleading and everything else, which I found highly impressive. There's also a section in the middle which features some exotic percussion, vocal chants and other atmospherics which seem utterly spiritual. Moving along to \\"Modern Times Rock N' Roll.\\" This to me reminds me not of Led Zeppelin, but of some of the music that was labeled as proto-punk back in the 70s. In fact, to bring some attention to the former, I really don't think Queen has much in common with Led Zeppelin as many others seem to claim (I was particularly offended and infuriated by comments made by some of those half-witted critics for the Rolling Stone regarding Queen.) The many years I've been listening to Queen, I was never once reminded of Zeppelin. I would encourage many other reviewers not to buy too much into those comparisons, as to compare one band to the other is like comparing apples and oranges. \\"Son & Daughter\\" has a sinister glam-metal feel to it, especially in the slow, seductive heavy blasts from Brian's guitar, fronted by Freddie's venomous vocals. \\"Jesus\\" is the religious-infused closer to the album, which features some clomping chords from Brian (mostly minor chords), while Freddie gives a passionate vocal performance full of conviction. The track also sounds like it could have come from a Broadway musical. \\"Seven Seas Of Rhye\\" is a short, instrumental and somewhat alternate version of the full track found on the following album _Queen II_. The bonus cut called \\"Mad The Swine\\" is a keeper. I'm surprised this didn't make the original cut. A percussion-heavy track which also features some religious lyrics.<br />An excellent, prestigious and often overlooked debut. It's probably not best recommended for the uninitiated Queen fan to start out with, but for the Queen fan who owns a few of their albums (especially their more essential ones), and has interest in experiencing the roots of the band. Conversely, it's also recommended for the listener who appreciates quality rock music, added with some bizarre and sophisticated elements.of those half-witted critics for the Rolling Stone regarding Queen.)

B00005JKCH|4.0|Spider-Man is an entertaining film that is a great summertime, popcorn movie.  The film explores the origins of the transformation of Peter Parker from nerdy high school student to the web slinging superhero Spider-Man.  Tobey Maguire is quite good in the title role.  He plays the character with the right amount of torment as an outcast who has been put down all his life, but injects pride, joy and happiness into the Peter from his newly bestowed powers.  Kirtsen Dunst is Peter's next door neighbor, Mary Jane Watson.  Ms. Dunst is not given much to work worth in the character, she is the requisite love interest, damsel in distress but she is appealing in the role.  Willem Dafoe is plays the Green Goblin who is the villain in the film.  The Goblin's alter ego is Norman Osborne who is the rich father of Harry (James Franco), Peter's best friend and roommate.  Mr. Dafoe is perfectly cast as the Goblin and he handles the character's schizophrenic outbursts with creepy aplomb.  Mr. Franco plays Harry sullenly and he appears as if he is moping through the picture.  J.K. Simmons plays Daily Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson as a pushy, demanding blowhard who listens only to himself with hilarious results.  People have criticized the fighting and action scenes, but they are really no better or worse than most current action films.  There are some Matrix like sequences with the slow motion, but these scenes actually help show Spider-Man's spider senses that allow him to anticipate and react quickly to danger.  The film was a box office smash and we should expect to see numerous sequels that will hopefully be as appealing as the first installment.
B00008S2VG|4.0|A great mix of acoustic and tech sounds.  The first time I listened to it, I wasn't impressed.  You have to listen to it a few times to like it.
B00003CXA6|5.0|I remember first seeing this movie.  My dad pulled my brother and I out of school for the day so that we could go see this movie since we all knew we'd learn more from this movie than from school itself.  We couldn't have been more right.  <BR>For those thinking of watching this for the first time, remember that it is long, and very very accurate.  Think of how butchered the film would be if they crammed three days of battles into less than four hours!<BR>What this means is, you don't have a film littered with love stories that never happened, or one main hero out to save the day.  Instead you have non-modernized speech, strategy-talk that might not be fully relevant to upcoming scenes, and facial hair that is so amazing it looks fake.  <BR>I've felt you can always tell a film is accurate when it seems just the opposite.  I remember seeing scenes where charecters seem fake, or out of place, only to hear the stories of the charecters later from my history buff Dad.  <BR>My Junior year of college I got the opertunity to go with my father to Gettysburg to see the battlefield.  I was amazed at how the directors were able to cover all the monuments and still pull off a realistic look to the movie.  <BR>I remember touring the museum, seeing photo's of soldiers.  I was amazed at how dead on their portrayals were.  I read many reviews from those who claim the actors look unrealistic.  I ask them simply to view the end credits where they show the actual person followed by the actor.  Jeff Daniels as Chamberlin is almost eerie.  And I can see where the directors went with Civil War reinactors, bringing their own outfits, instead of average extras.  <BR>In the end, you can't find a more accurate movie when it comes to Civil War history.  Even though it's four hours, you'll find yourself not only entertained, but informed.  <BR>Any part that may seem confusing is there for a reason.  Not so that you can come on here and run your mouth about how bad it is, but so you do something completely foriegn to people today.  Crack a book.

B00005RFAI|5.0|When I first heard soundclips off of this album, I absolutely hated it!  But then one day, I realized I needed a few cd's in my collection that had more meaningful songs.  Something else other than \\"Baby, you're the one for me, etc.\\"  Not that that's unbearable to listen to, but sometimes I want to listen to something else for a change.  I wanted to broaden my music horizons a little.  That's when I gave this album a second chance!  And of course, I love it!  I can totally relate to \\"Eventually\\", a song about people that treated you like ... getting what they deserve by fate.  I can also relate to \\"Numb\\" and \\"Respect\\".  Pink is proof that music can be \\"real\\", inspiring, and meaningful without putting you to sleep!  Music with substance doesn't always have to be bland coffeehouse numbers or lifeless midtempo rock songs.  And unlike most other \\"real\\" artists, the songs on this album are all different from each other.  You can actually tell where one song ends and the next begins!  This is one of the few CD's I own where I don't have to skip over tracks!!
B00005OM4Q|5.0|This two-disc set really should be a lesson to everyone else who is releasing DVD's today.  Full of great extras, two different versions of the film, some cool easter eggs and wonderful commentary, this is a perfect DVD set.  First off, the movie is wonderful- it really did not get the attention it deserved when it came out.  The acting, writing, soundtrack- all wonderful.  Every performance is wonderful- not a weak actor in the film though I have to give a special nod to Philip Seymour Hoffman as rock critic Lester Bangs- just a great fit.  Based on Director Cameron Crowe's life as a teen writing for Rolling Stone in the 1970's- the movie has a gentle touch to it with a delightful love story and a fair amount of laughs.  The sound (both Dolby Digital and DTS) is great as is the picture quality.  The extras are many and the disappointments few.  Crowe's mom rocks as she watches a part of her life on the screen.  This is a fun package. This is a DVD that should be part of the collection of anyone who enjoys good movies and the potential fulfilled of a great DVD package.  Keep rocking Stillwater!
0345457684|5.0|This is a great first novel, kind of a mix between William Gibson, Raymond Chandler, and Quentin Tarantino.  In other words, its a hard-boiled, cyberpunky, frenetically paced and shamelessly, gleefully violent piece of work.  But it's also a great piece of s-f in the classic sense, with interesting, plausible ideas and exciting technology.  Throw in the satisfying mystery plot, strong writing and engaging characters, and you've got yourself an unusually good read.<BR>If you liked this book, check out John Grim[s]wood's RedRobe and Remix.
B00000BKDV|5.0|After the successful \\"Number of the Beast,\\" drummer Clive Burr departed and replacing him would be their craziest and current drummer, Nicko McBrain. While Clive Burr wasn't bad, McBrain brought a zanier style to the Maiden fold and added to the live experience. Here's the lowdown:<br />Where Eagles Dare - Simply brilliant. The drums here showcase Nicko's abilities to the fullest. A little overlong, but why carp? A good opener.<br />Revelations - Another brilliant rocker. Bruce really belts it out on this one! It also has an epic tone to it and the lyrics themselves are great. Bruce really wrote a classic.<br />Flight of Icarus - One of my favorites! Great, rocking epic. Adrian and Bruce wrote this song together. The riff in this song is one of the most memorable riffs ever created by this great heavy metal band.<br />Die With Your Boots On - This one is bashed on by many, but I really don't see why. It's a little weaker in comparison to the previous tracks, but the essence of Maiden is still there.<br />The Trooper - My favorite from this album and one of the two hits. The chorus is unique and the lyrics awesome. Just a rocking good song with scorching solos by Dave and Adrian.<br />Still Life - Although it's not called \\"Piece of Mind,\\" this is actually the title track of the album. This one's also a bit underrated. However, this is one of the strongest tracks on the album.<br />Quest for Fire - Kind of a midpaced epic. This one actually is the most debated song on the album; some like it, others don't. I didn't particularly like this one. The chorus isn't all that catchy and overall, this is the weakest here.<br />Sun and Steel - Pretty good rocker. This one's also midpaced. This one takes a little getting used to, but it's a solid song from start to finish.<br />To Tame a Land - This is also an underrated one. This is the big-scale epic of the album (practically every Maiden album has one). Although it doesn't hold a candle against Rime of the Ancient Mariner or Alexander the Great, this is still an impressive song. Bruce's vocals are excellent here as well.<br />All in all, this is one of the highest marks in Maiden's career. It's strange that it's both underrated and overrated; Overrated because many like it for The Trooper and Flight of Icarus alone and underrated because it has a slew of songs that aren't recognized like they should be (i.e. Die With Your Boots On). I recommend this for any fan of heavy metal and especially the Iron Maiden fan. This is a 5-star effort from one of metal's supreme bands.Alexander the Great, this is still an impressive song.

B00003CXE7|4.0|Russell Crowe in another role - he is boffed up, but still brings the same doggedness and humanity to this roles. It is good to see him in a role where his character is competent. Gladiator is the story of one General Maximus, whom the Caesar wants to appoint instead of his own son. As the son, Commodus, kills his father, Maximus is threatened by death as he refuses to follow him. He is captured and becomes a gladiator, with only one purpose - revenge. <br />If anything, Gladiator is a clever fable against democracy and the masses, who are represented by the throngs of Rome who seek \\"bread and games\\". They can be made to cheer for the death of thousands and thousands - like people today cheer at movies depicting the War on Drugs, and foreign wars. They can be pacified by bread and games, while corrupt individuals manipulate the power around them to gain material riches, and the Republic (the rule of law, the US Constitution) is crumbling. <br />Unfortunately it is also a story about gladiators, and therefore about plentiful gratuitous violence. I'm afraid I can't stomach that, but if you can, then you must see Gladiator (that is, if you missed it the first time). It is yet another movie that teaches basic lessons of life that are yet to be learned by most people, because we now value blissfull ignorance more than being civilized.
6305736650|5.0|So many others have done justice to this outstanding movie, I will focus on technical quality of this DVD. I do love this movie, I've seen it perhaps 15 times in as many years. And of course Casablanca is one of the most quotable movies ever!<br />The DVD transfer of this B&amp;W classic is OUTSTANDING!! I watch this on my 2200 lumens front projection system. I have an enormous screen measuring 14.5' diagonal! I can easily see the quality of the digital transfer on every DVD, and I am astonished at the high quality of this transfer for Casablanca.<br />The film noire aspect is perfectly captured in high resolution sharp detail (but not excessively so). You can see absolutely everything ... the patterns on ties, Ingrid's jewelry and beautiful hair, incredible detail on wardrobe and props, etc. If you are used to seeing Casablanca on VHS, then viewing this DVD on a nice home theater system will be like seeing the movie for the first time ... it is so rich in detail.<br />The quality of the contrast calibration is great! Deep black, crisp white and an excellent transfer curve in between. All the cast look great. They really did an excellent job in transferring this classic film. I know I sound impressed, but I am not exaggerating in the least about the quality ... my home theater screen is huge and this film looks great, as good as anything you would ever see in a cinema. I am not easy to please, and this disc is so well done that this great film is a joy to watch, again and again and again.<br />The dolby digital 2.0 mono audio transfer is excellent as well. It's hard to believe that this disc is of a film made 61 years ago.<br />Very well done DVD. Enjoy!

Having experienced many of these songs performed live recently, I was moved by the enthusiasm of the crowd and its deep reaction to Gore's presence, exceeded only by his appreciable talent as a songwriter.

Lack of any interisting story, and a less than engaging lead character make this book next to impossible to enjoy.

B00006DEFA|4.0|I've been going to the movies for more than half a century, so I can state with absolute confidence that \\"Amadeus\\" is one of the _the_ all-time-great films. It's both wildly entertaining and abstractly \\"perfect\\" in a way that transcends verbal description. (The magnificent performances of Mozart's music by Sir Neville and The Academy don't hurt, either.) Is it any surprise that Pauline Kael -- the Antonio Salieri of film critics -- didn't like it?<br />Even snot-nosed young-uns who couldn't be less interested in classical music have told me they were mesmerized by \\"Amadeus.\\" (And it wasn't the fart scenes that caught them.) Why \\"Amadeus\\" wasn't one of the \\"100 Greatest Films\\" selected by People magazine is beyond my comprehension. I therefore need to warn viewers that this version IS NOT the director's cut -- the original theatrical version is!<br />The supplemental material for the deluxe laserdisk included most of the scenes that were \\"restored\\" to this edition, with the director and producer explaining WHY they were REMOVED!!! The most significant is Salieri's forced seduction of Constanza, which changes the PG rating to an R, and both vulgarizes and makes hash of the story.<br />We are supposed to feel _some_ sympathy for Salieri, a musical hack standing in awe of an infinitely more-talented human being who appears to be the recipient of a very selective divine dispensation -- most of us have experienced that feeling. His promise of help for Mozart in exchange for sex from Constanza destroys whatever sympathy we might have. And it directly contradicts his offer to God to remain chaste in exchange for musical ability.<br />Still a terrific film, but down a (big) notch from five stars. Find the original if you can.<br />Interesting note: The original version is, as far as I know, the only PG-rated film with frontal male nudity.
B000002N3N|5.0|Many times, AND WITH GOOD REASON, the \\"new age\\" label gets slammed for lacking originality and conviction. Enya is not an artist who blends in with the rest and this release is, in my opinion, her best to date.<br />There is certainly an ethereal quality associated with new age and Enya is certainly a new age artist, but she has strong writing skills and gorgeous and very unique voice that sets her apart from her peers. And if you look at what is being released these days, many groups are ripping off elements of her uniqueness and plastering them on down tempo songs with session singers who do an ok job of copying Enya, but don't reach the depths of beauty and passion that only Enya seems to find.<br />What makes this a 5-star review for me is that the songs work independently and even better as a cohesive set that keeps you involved and feeling like you are living in an even better world than this one we know. I know this sounds ridiculous, but take this review from someone who usually prefers an entirely different type of music. Al the songs are great and although this CD can be great background music, it works even better when it's in the forefront of your attention because the production work is so masterful.<br />Many artists/fans are critical of the work that the producer brings to the table, but I am always very appreciative when the final product does not sound like it was manufactured by an assembly line, but rather reflects a balance of the artist's intent with the listener in mind.<br />Thanks for reading and I would like to thank ALL reviewers as their opinions (even when I disagree) give me clues as to what I may like and even more importantly provide exposure to artists who I may have missed if it were not for work. Also, thanks to Amazon.com for providing this forum as I think that it clearly benefits the company, but ultimately it also can be a great place for a potential buyer to find his or her next favorite CD.
B000000XB9|5.0|I bought this cd because I had heard a lot of CCR's songs on the radio and I loved the guitar solos. &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot; and &quot;Heard it Through the Grapevine&quot; are two of my many favorites on the album.
B000002L9J|5.0|I could talk for hours about how this album has influenced me in ways I wouldn't have thought possible, praise the magnetic beauty of Morrissey's voice, his painfully spot-on lyrics, Johnny Marr's immaculate guitar work and the wonderfully catchy yet bittersweet melodies, what it's like to listen to I Know It's Over on repeat when you have a broken heart or how There Is a Light That Never Goes Out is the most perfect song ever recorded. But I'm not going to do that. I'll leave all the discovering up to you and, frankly, I am envious of all the people out there who have yet to discover this amazing album. Smiths lovers of the world, unite and take over!
B0000931OG|3.0|I agree - with Joel Dale's &quot;Not stellar&quot; write up, and anyone who thinks this is a let down. Blur has been all along one of rock's cutting edge bands, ready to take chances, risks, to let us all know what's coming up next. But this? This is rehash. This has been done. Done by Blur, yes, and by Albarn's side projects, sure. The disappointment comes at knowing they took years (!) to create this new album and, low and behold, it's bits-n-pieces of old-Blur, of Gorillaz, of Mali Music; though nothing, not an ounce of this, is new. Two listens, maybe three: that's all I gave it before I vehemently yanked out their &quot;13&quot; ablum and listened to what is still cutting edge, to what they should've added onto to. But no. <br />Graham Coxon. God love him. He was a much bigger part of Blur than any one of us may have imagined. Now we know. It wasn't all the Damon Albarn Show. <br />I wanted more ethnic influence: didn't get it. Figured with no ethnic thing going on I would settle for a progressive Gorillaz thing: nope. Not quite sure what it is. Just a B-side Blur throwaway. Their first, and hopefully the last.<br />I'm sure looking forward to the next Stereophonics and Radiohead albums. July is looking up after this dismal May...
B00000AFFI|3.0|Heard \\"Rid Of Me\\" a few years ago and found it very off-putting. This CD is a little mellower in that the production is cleaner and the arrangements are a little quieter; on balance, though, this is a CD that will please any PJ enthusiast but not too many others. My take is that if you thought Bryan Ferry made a habit of exposing his emotions in song, he doesn't hold a candle to PJ. She would suck all the juices out of Ferry's body and leave him a charred, crispy, quivering husk. She is without a doubt the queen of raging, tragic, compulsive/obsessive songwriting. A rawer expression of obsessive love and flat-out horniness would be very difficult to find, unless it were other PJ albums. Way too raw for my taste. She's positively flagitious in her need to expose every single raw-nerved aspect of her failed physical relationships. Jeez! Have a beer! It must be hard to find good men in Cornwall. Oh well, she's moved to New York now anyway so she's probably doing better now, poor dear. Musically, PJ is also the mistress of the brief, punchy song. The best song on the CD, \\"Elise,\\" is less than three minutes and cries out for longer treatment. My wife really likes her, though.
B00008S2VG|5.0|She did it again, is all i have to say. American Life might have to be Madonna's best album to date since Ray of Light, since nothing will come close to that album. Though many critics and fellow fans and haters of Madonna do not ever seem to get past criticising her personally and not articticly. This album is incredible. The eccentric sound of the electronic beats along with the folky guitar and the fact you can always hear her singing so cleary (as apposed to either miss spears or jlo who's voices are always covered up with stupid beat lines so you never sure if they can really sing.<BR>We all know and even Madonna knows she is not the greatest singer, but she makes an effort to actually sing her songs. Her aristic talent to produce music that sounds nothing like what we hear everyday goes unoticed by everyone. Because we are so more involved with finding her faults with her personally.<BR>To those we have not bought this album and to even those of you who have it. Listen to it again and again, because this is the work of a true musical artist not so made up coporate identity trying to make a buck.
B000002B2X|4.0|Unfortunately, Ann Wilson decided to peek her head into this project. This could potentially have been a perfect album, but her vocals take too much away from the songs. Perfect example: Brother. Listen to her harmonizing with Cantrell and then go listen to the Unplugged version where Staley does the harmonizing. There's just no substitute for the Cantrell/Staley formula. Not to knock AIC for trying something new, it just didn't work. Am I Inside is another prime example of this. The harmonizing is at some points so bad that it's hard to listen to.<br />  Now, the good points. Got Me Wrong is one of AIC's best. (The fact that it's on the movie Clerks doesn't hurt either, hehe) Great guitar fill at the beginning which serves as a perfect hook for the rest of the song. Right Turn is great as well. Very simple tune as far as the guitar work goes, but the vocals are what makes this baby shine. When Chris Cornell kicks in at the end, it makes you want to hit the repeat button.<br />  Overall, great great work by Jerry Cantrell on the guitar parts. Mike Starr really didn't get much of an opportunity to shine on the bass in this album, neither did Sean Kinney on drums. Layne of course blows 99% of all other vocalists away as usual. Again, the only real weak point was Ann Wilson on backups. If you can get by that, though, this is a definite addition to an AIC collection.
0515123447|5.0|The review of the new Jack Reacher novel says the publisher is using the slogan &quot;The best writer you're not reading-yet!&quot; Lucky, lucky me! I discovered Jack Reacher with this book and have read the following books with great relish! Lee Child is a great writer and Jack Reacher is a great character; someone a man would like to emulate and a woman (like me!) would love to meet. I can review 4-in-1. Read all of Child's work, starting with Killing Floor. You'll be very glad you did.
B0000931OG|2.0|Originally 3 stars, I have now, in a moment of musical sanity, demoted this ablum to 2 stars. This is due to the listening of Blur's album &quot;13&quot;. I just couldn't take this new one again, so I pulled 13 from my cd collection and realized - again - what a gem it is. Deep, textured, progressive. Everything Think Tank isn't. I'd of rather waited years longer to hear something worthy of Blur, even without Coxon. Granted...<br />Granted, Alex James bass on Think Tank has never been better. I'll give em that. But nothing more.<br />Instead of buying this album, if you don't own a Blur album, purchase 13. Caramel and Trim Trab are two of the better rock songs recorded in the last decade. They stand strong and able next to anything Radiohead has done. <br />With the departure of Graham Coxon - and I hate to say it - Blur should've broken up. This album is testament to why.
B00008OLYN|5.0|this album is perfect in every way. hauntingly beautiful. i can't put it into words. this is the greatest piece of art to ever grace my ears. i bow in awe of opeth.
B00008NG5V|4.0|A very smooth and leisurally CD. Just run it through your CD player and relax. Run the whole CD through straight or shuffle the songs, either way they all flow after another. There really isn't a sign of maturity to this sophmore CD, but like the title of the CD explains, &quot;on and on&quot;, probably from &quot;Brushfire Fairy Tale&quot;.
6304080921|5.0|I was surprised by this one. I was under the impressions that conspiracy, time travel movies were not meant for Bruce Willis, but I was very wrong. His role in this movie was wonderfully written, and as usual his acting was supurb. I can also say that I don't think I have ever seen a better preformance out of Brad Pitt. <br />This is a film about a convict (Bruce Willis) who is sent back in time to find out more information pertaining to a viral disater that struck in the past in hopes of stopping the devistation that has forced a portion of the surviving popultaion to live under ground. <br />This is well written, and for being a far fetched story line it is made very believable. The twists and turns the film takes will keep you guessing until the very end.  While watching this one remember that it all makes a lot better sense in the end, just be a little patient.
0812550706|4.0|Ender Wiggin is the last chance for the planet Earth and the Human Race. The Buggers, an evil alien race bent on conquest, is intent on destyoing humanity. They have superior technology and and outmatch humanity in every way. But the resourceful leaders of earth have come up with a brillant and devious plan based on the manipulation of human psychology. Their plan is to breed a genius capable of commanding a force to defeat the buggers and destroy their home planet. Through genetics and behaviorial psychology they train Ender Wiggin to become the greatest general in human history. Through nature and nuture they train Ender to rely only on himself and to be cold and ruthless. To think outside the box and not be restrained by convetional thinking on any sort or by morality. This book chronicals his training to become that supreme commander. He has two older siblings, a brother and a sister. Both are brillant but pale in comparison to him. They were both failed experiments in creating the perfect military commander. The boy Peter, Ender's brother, was a sociopath with no feelings. He was too self absorbed to care about winning a war and lacked the disipline necessary to be a leader. Ender's sister was to nice to make the hard choices. Ender is the perfect balance between his extreeme siblings. He is cold when necessary and warm when necessary. He is basically a good person but is systmatically twisted into a strategic mental killing machine. The ending has a great twist that some label anticlimatic but that is because they lack intellegence. This book is a psychological thriller that puts the weight of the world, literally, on a 12 year old boy.
B000004CYT|5.0|perhaps the major innovation in recent classical music practice was the exploration, beginning 30 years ago, of the post baroque repertory using \\"authentic\\" musical instruments and interpretative styles. this was already an established approach for baroque and renaissance works, where authentic instruments changed the technical demands and resources of players and the entire sound experience of the performances. by now the approach has been applied to every composer from schubert to brahms (under makerras), but beethoven's symphonies were the beachhead in the \\"modern\\" repertory.<br /><br />hogwood's beethoven cycle was overshadowed at the time of its release by the metrically obsessive and aimless performances of roger norrington (\\"dr. tick tock\\"), who applied \\"authentic\\" practice with a lack of musical ease ... yet over time the hogwood set just seems better and better. the AAM plays with a delightful ensemble and control: from the fingerwrenching finale of the eighth symphony to the technically fearsome valveless horns in the third, this was a performance of discovery and challenge for all the players, and they pulled it off handsomely. the tempos are not always authentic -- the tempo of the first movement of the 3rd symphony is in fact the same as that recorded by furtwängler! -- but there is plenty of nuance and drama in the dynamics and phrasing. the eroica has beautifully long periods, the pastoral a lively but not rushed feeling of \\"new life experienced in the country,\\" and the choral finale of the ninth is glorious, all the singers in top form.<br /><br />best of all, the sound is superb, with a wide dynamic range and ample soundstage and without the string harshness sometimes associated with period performance recordings. there is a sheer, transparent quality to the sound that lets the musicality shine clearly -- it's a wonderful experience. (i should mention: i own the original individual cd's, so can't comment on the packaging or booklet of the boxed set.)
B0000634EV|5.0|Truly brilliant!<br />Sometimes in music, not often, it happens.<BR>Some guys make an album that will stand out for many many years ahead, and trust me this is one of them.<br />just buy it!
B00008NG5V|5.0|Jack Johnson is one artist that i can truly say i can listen to his whole album. He has amazing lyrics, great melodies, and his percussive playing ability is soothing. When you listen to this album, think Hawaii, think surf, think sand and think simplicity.
0375703861|1.0|I share a lot in common with Zadie Smith and was honestly expecting to love this book; I completely bought the hype and the comparison to Dickens thrilled me. I have to say though that Smith is no Dickens. Charles Dickens had compassion for his characters even when they were presented as caricatures. Zadie has the caricature part down but needs to work on the feeling. Such a cold cruel book, goodness. An author should have other things in mind when setting down to write a book, things besides proving how clever or better they are than the rest of us especially the poor losers who people their novels.
B00004Z459|4.0|There's no doubt that any song from Linkin Park will get stuck in your head after you hear it. If that is a good thing or a bad thing, it's up to you to decide. Me, I think it's a good thing on a short term period. After you've heard In The End for the hundred time, I'm not sure if that's still a good thing.<br />Hybrid Theory (Linkin Park's original name) is full of immediate hits. Papercut is, in my mind, their best song. It's crazy how much energy they've jammed in that song. One Step Closer, the first single, is not far being. Unfortunately, it gets old after a lot of listens (I mean a lot). Papercut never gets old. Crawling, second single, is also quite catchy. It grabs your attention fast and doesn't let go. Same with the third single, In The End, but in a different way. In The End is slower and can make it's way right to the heart. A Place For my Head, which should have been a single but wasn't, is as good as the ones mentionned above. The other tracks are a better listen with friends rather than alone. If you're alone, you might just realized they're nothing special.<br />Like or hate them, Linkin Park knows how to make a record a success. Both their albums have winning formulas. Hybrid Theory came out at about the same time Limp Bizkit's Chocolate Starfish did. I found Linkin Park's offering way more satisfying then Limp Bizkit's. These guys were a happy surprise. I'm just hoping they're not planning to release the same album over and over. Hybrid Theory or Meteora ? They're the same album, with different titles. Only Meteora doesn't have Papercut.
0688163173|5.0|I love Lehane's stuff, but this one is exponentially better than the rest. Simply put - the best book I've read in a decade.
B000002LMK|5.0|This is one of the great rock albums. Neil spent a horrible time in 1980's going through a personal and familial crisis/hell. In 89 he returned to rock n roll to find his sanity again and toured playing wild, cathartic, almost violent music - very very very loud. Ragged glory - this album - was what he made after the storm had finished.<BR>It's LOUD it ROCKS but it's PURE JOY. It's really one of the great rock albums. It's great music.
B000005ILF|5.0|I mainly bought this album because of &quot;Valparaiso&quot;, which is my favorite song on the album, but it isn't the only good song by any means.<br />I can read so many meanings into Sting's lyrics, that I constantly find myself relating one of his songs to something currently going on in my life.  This month, it was &quot;Let your soul be your pilot&quot;.<br />I guess I'll be buying anything that Sting sells, for as long as I have ears.
1878424319|1.0|Like many others, the inside flap caught my attention, particularly point 2.  Unfortunately, the &quot;commentary&quot; on each point contains contradictions, illogic, and some downright bad advice.<br />For example, one piece of advice given as a &quot;path to freedom&quot; is to make a choice to do what we do as children when parents try to domesticate us.  We can rebel and say &quot;No!&quot;  We can declare a war against the parasite, a war against the Judge and the Victim, a war for our independence, a war for the right to use our own mind and our own brain.&quot;  Is domestication always to be considered a negative thing?  <br />Being child-like is one thing, being childish, selfish, and immature is quite another.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is what i call a band! Evanescence is easily, one of the finest bands that Ive heard. \\"Fallen\\" really is a work of art.<br />Going Under: EXCELLENT<BR>Packed with meaning in the words. Great melodies. Great vocals. Simply a great song. <br />Bring Me to Life: EXCELLENT<BR>When I heard this in DareDevil, I thought, \\"I simply must have this song.\\" Another killer song.<br />Everybody's Fool: GOOD<BR>I liked this song. Has a nice melody throughout the piece. Again, good vocals.<br />My Immortal: EXCELLENT<BR>Another song from the movie DareDevil. One of the top songs on the CD. Great vocals and awesome melodies. A Must have song. <br />Haunted: AVERAGE<BR>This wasnt a bad song, I still found it enjoyable, though it's not as melodic as the others. It may not suit everyones taste. <br />Tourniquet: GOOD<BR>Nice song. Good melodies. A good solid song.<br />Imaginary: GOOD<BR>This song has a great opening. Good piano work. Another song that will find yourself entranced.<br />Taking Over Me: EXCELLENT<BR>Another song for the books. Again, great vocals.<br />Hello: EXCELLENT<BR>Like \\"My Immortal\\" it's one of their softer songs backed up by the piano and some strings. Has a dark atmosphere to this song, nevertheless another work of art.<br />My Last Breath: EXCELLENT<BR>This song is great. Great melodies and vocals. Can I say more?<br />Whisper: GOOD<BR>Has a good choras and I liked the \\"opera like\\" singers. A very solid song.
B000002VC5|5.0|An instant classic, 1977's &quot;I Robot&quot; was the first big commercial breakthrough for The Alan Parsons Project. A themed album about Man's relation to machines &amp; vice versa, it's a winning combination of both the Project's art-rock &amp; pop sensibilities, and, being released in 1977, it even has a great *disco* feel to some of the tracks, like the funky hit &quot;I Wouldn't Want To Be Like You,&quot; &quot;The Voice,&quot; and the marvelous instrumental title track. More incredible music continues on other fine tracks like &quot;Some Other Time,&quot; &quot;Don't Let It Show,&quot; and the beautiful &quot;Day After Day (The Show Must Go On).&quot; And there's more great instrumental pieces in the breathtaking &quot;Nucleus,&quot; the ominous &quot;Total Eclipse,&quot; and the powerful &quot;Genesis Ch.1 V.32.&quot; Great vocals abound from the likes of Allan Clarke, Steve Harley, Lenny Zakatek, the English Chorale &amp; others, the songwriting by Parsons &amp; Eric Woolfson is solid, and the group's musical chemistry is nothing short of supreme. The album's production work is simply amazing, and Andrew Powell's impressive orchestrations are the icing on the cake. One of the best recorded unions of prog &amp; pop, the Alan Parsons Project's &quot;I Robot&quot; is an astonishing work.
0316666343|5.0|This book was by far the best book I have ever read. It had such a creative portrayal of life and death and heaven. I would recommend this book to absolutely anyone who has a few hours to spare, but I'm warning you now, its hard to put it down.
1878424319|4.0|It's been almost 9 months since I first reviewed this book and, after searching several other paths and philosophies, I have realized that the Toltec \\"way\\" talked about in this book has many similarities to the ways of Zen and Daoism (I realize the contradiction on the later).  <br />In any case, 9 months later, I'm revising the rating I gave this book to 4 stars.
B00008WG3U|5.0|your new recording is great through and through. Its great to see open eyes and hate for eye shutting communist capatilistic rulers such as ours its a new breed of dictatorship..mixed together with a matterless state as long as the taxes keep flowing. i wonder if theyll play it on the radio...hahaha
B00008DDXC|4.0|I'll start this one off on an odd note: I ...(.. HATED THE FIRST HARRY POTTER FILM. I HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE that film. Never before have I seen such a commercially driven flick designed to do nothing more than drain parents' wallets. <br />But I liked this film. Surprised the hell out of me. <br />This film starts off on a note that I thought was going to be a re-hash of what I didn't like about the first flick: namely cutesy-wutsey-oh-thats-so-funny-family-slapstick-comedy. Once it escapes this \\"dungeon\\" that it has found itself in and manages to get to the meat of the film, it's pretty darned good. Gone are the pointless references that are thrown in your face. Gone are the explanations of things so long (and only slightly less pointless) that they bore you to tears. <br />No no no... in this installment the filmmakers actually manage to create a sense of danger and suspense. They set up a villain that is unexpected and interesting, and even manage to throw in a few pointless references that don't annoy me to death. <br />The players in this film also deserve a mention. Every actor in this film seems to have become more comfortable with their work in this installment. Daniel Radcliffe's performance (and his much deeper voice which gave me a chuckle or two) is much more.. mature, Rupert Grint (while still kind of a whiner) has at least two moments of actual backbone, and Emma Watson also has some genuinely interesting moments. To say nothing of Alan Rickman (my hero)'s performance.<br />All in all a really good film. I even will grudgingly admit that the first (again, awful) film was necessary in order to lay a foundation for this one.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay has done it again. This second album is as good as the first, if not better. Great music, great lyrics, and great continuity. Thought provoking and intellegent. What more is there to say? Get this album and put it next to the classics on your shelf where it belongs.
B000089RVX|4.0|01. Going Under - 4/5 - A powerful opening that provides the listener an accurate example of what to expect on the rest of the CD.<BR>02. Bring Me To Life - 5/5 - The catchy song that got myself (and everyone else) interested in finding out else Amy, Ben, and company can do. I must have listened to this 50 times the first day I got a hold of it. Evanescence at its best blend of sounds.<BR>03. Everybody's Fool - 4/5 - Nice punk tune, but doesn't stick in my head that much among the rest of the songs.<BR>04. My Immortal - 5/5 - Simply beautiful... The only pure ballad on the CD, and Amy Lee's voice is magical.<BR>05. Haunted - 3/5 - Haunting, like its namesake. But it gets repetitive really fast.<BR>06. My Tourniquet - 4/5 - Initially one of my favorites. As said before, has some neo-Christian lyricism that is very intriguing. It's also got a driving beat that I love.<BR>07. Imaginary - 5/5 - Amy's soaring voice lingers in your head long after she's stopping singing. The best track on the CD after Bring Me to Life.<BR>08. Taking Over Me - 4/5 - A little more thumping rock than speeding or soaring in this one. Still a fun track.<BR>09. Hello - 4/5 - More haunting than &quot;Haunted.&quot; Listen to over and again if you really want to make yourself suicidal.<BR>10. My Last Breath - 3/5 - A more rocking song that is less dependent upon speeding-techno. Love the intro, but it loses steam after awhile.<BR>11. Whisper - 5/5 - Now this is how you end a disc like this. Really picks up speed and carries you off towards their next Album, which I'm eagerly awaiting already.<br />Ultimately, many of the songs sound much like each other, the same kind of speed-nu-metal. There's also no narrative thread of any kind. You could have put these tracks in almost any order and gotten the same result from the CD. There's lots of hints that Evanescence is capable of so many more flavors, but apart from My Immortal and Hello, everything keeps coming back to the speeding and soaring drivingrhythms. It's a little one-note, but that one note is so good this disc is staying in my changer for a while yet.
B00005JLH2|4.0|A two hour long movie predominently about black kids at a southern university with no profanity, no drug usage or drinking?<br />Very refreshing. This is a great family film for all.
B00005YW4H|1.0|Critics of Norah Jones are constantly accused of not liking her because she can't be &quot;labeled&quot; or &quot;she's not jazz&quot;. Music doesn't have to be categorized and understandable to be &quot;good&quot;. If everything &quot;good&quot; was easily identifiable, then Norah Jones would be the supreme goddess of all music. And that is the sole essence of the back and forth Norah-debate. She IS easy to categorize: soft music. And no, there is nothing wrong with that at all. I happen to like soft music every once in a while. Beauty and serenity are things seldom seen in modern music, so it is good to have them around. However, beauty and serenity alone don't make music good. The critics of Norah Jones aren't attacking her mildness (well, okay SOME are), they are attacking her popularity, for Norah Jones offers nothing new. She has nothing musically interesting to say. She's definitely not &quot;bad&quot; or untalented, it's just hard to understand how something so commonplace became so popular. It also must be frustrating to hear music that is new, different, interesting, challenging, and original go unnoticed day after decade in the face of such musical mediocrity. It's not fair. And although not many people will admit it, but THAT'S what's being attacked, not her music.<BR>Her music is just that: music. Nothing terribly good or horribly bad. Just something nice to listen to if that's your taste. And in such cases, awards are not deserved.
B00008LDPU|4.0|After seeing the animatrix at the cinema I was impressed by the overall visual quality and integration of CG. WHy are the other reviews in here filled with innacurate descriptions of what it some of them are about or who the directors are?<BR>They were very good overall with standouts for me being those directed by SHinichiro Watanabe- Beyond and detective story.<br />I found the 2 parts of renaissance to be weak and didnt like having the borrowed imagery from WWII and ideas from Asimov all congealed in an un-appealing mess and shoved down my throat. I expected better considering it was written by the wachowskis. It really but me in mind of metropolis but done in a half arse kind of way. WHile visually to metropolis it is still very pretty
0802130208|2.0|After reading A Confederacy of Dunces I was really disappointed in the book. The novel was supposed to be humorous. However, as I started to read more into the book I felt really annoyed with the characters in the book, and with the book itself. A theme that the author, John Kennedy Toole, tries to display is that the characters are foolish and unhappy because people in society aren't helping one another and that is a major reason why they are unhappy. <BR> The characters, especially Ignatius, annoyed me because they weren't unhappy just because no one was helping them, it was also the fact that they didn't try to do something for themselves and be happy. Few people today in society will help someone so they can make their lives happier. My opinion is that this is a book that I could not read over again. I do not recommend this book if you want to laugh all it did was irritate me.
B00008CLOA|5.0|Well, we can cut the speculation now.<BR>  <BR>The 5.1 channel surround version has superb sound quality and adds a depth and texture to the music that enhances the immersive experience that this album was always meant to be.  <br />This version recreates the three dimensional live experience where sounds spin around the room and shift from front to back and side to side.  <br />Lay back and listen, and float inside the music.
B00007GZR5|4.0|Robin WIlliams has a very mixed record when it comes to serious dramatic roles; he tends toward excessive earnestness and a certain cloying sort of over-emoting. But when he's good, he's very good; &quot;Garp&quot;, for example, was aa reasonably good film elevated by an above-average performance by Williams.<br />In this movie, Williams does occasionally slip into excessive bathos, but I'm willing to forgive him that, as the film is so beautiful overall. The story, as other have recounted, is one of love that lives beyond the grave- to hell and back, as it were. Most of the acting is very good, and dialogue, for the most part, is well written. The film does sometimes slip into what some may see as excessive sentimentalism, but this is a sentimental subject after all, and the film is really a fairy tale. It requires a certain assumption of innocence on the part of the viewer. Approach it that way, and you'l enjoy it.<br />The cinematography and special effects are breathtaking, and it's worth watching for that alone. But if you can allow yourself to buy into the story, and the romance, you'll find yourself carried away, and elated by this film.
B00005JL3A|2.0|... I was appalled by this adaptation. Everything that made the games so overwhelming - the feeling of dread and isolation, the brooding music, the terrifying jolts when zombies crash in on you, the complex relationships between the characters, the paranoia of who can be trusted and who not, and above all the excellent story about the mother of all corrupted corporations, Umbrella - all this has been reduced to nothing. <br />Instead we have yet another Matrix ... with thumping techno-soundtracks, a Lara Croftian tough babe with more one-liners you can recall, ... cgi, mind-numbing action (so what do you do when a zombie dog comes running for your throat? You whirl around mid-air three times and kung fu kick it right in the face!), and predictable plot twists. <br />The only redeeming ingredient is Milla Jovovich, who actually tries to put some depth in her character. Overall the best actors in this film are the zombies. In other words, everything you loved in the videogame has been torn to shreds in hope for a quick buck at the matinee. Avoid.
B00004RF8J|5.0|As a New Yorker, I remember the original Broadway version fondly.  It was based upon the Roger Corman classic which was shot in 1960 in just two days and featured a classic scene with Jack Nicolson in the dentists office (played by Bill Murray in this version).<br />This particular release is actually a movie version of the Broadway adaptation.  It features a great cast, including Rick Moranis and Ellen Greene (who was in the original Broadway version).<br />It's a silly premise, which was silly enough in the 1960's version, but with the music it's even sillier.

0783231032|3.0|This movie is BIG.  It had big stars, a big budget, big expectations and it was a big flop in the box office.<br />This movie was hot on the tails of Spielberg's first classics Jaws &amp; Close Encounters, so everybody was expecting a mega-blockbuster as a follow up.  His next film was the hugely popular E.T., so this one just faded away.<br />For what it's worth, I wasn't entirely impressed with it when it came out, but I'm a huge Aykroyd and Belushi fan, so I enjoyed it a bit more than the average person.  As years passed, I realized (along with a lot of other people), that this was not really a bad movie.<br />In retrospect, it's got quite a few good moments and it's worth seeing again with an open mind.  The extra footage added to the DVD helps fill in some of the continuity gaps that were not in the original, so it may be worth seeing just to see more of the original cut.
B00008WG3U|4.0|This cd is pretty good there starting to get back to there ska roots.  i was waiting for this cd when the teaser ep regaining unconciousness came out. i like this new nofx sound they have pop punk, ska, and new wave sounding music. its not ... pop punk like New found glory or nofx. the lyrics on this cd are better then ever. this cd deserves a 4 rating.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|I've been a fan of this movie for years.  I've always felt this movie was a classic and that it was way ahead of it's time.<br />I already owned this title on DVD prior to this version coming out, but I pre-ordered it in the hopes that it would live up to it's expectations of being the most complete version ever released.<br />Well, it wasn't just more complete, it was almost completely different!  My eyes popped out and my jaw droppped as I saw this release for the first time.  I immediately removed the DVD and ran to my collection to play my older version and refresh my memory as to the quality of the original release.  The differences were incredible!<br />I always assumed that the older version was just an indication of the overall production quality of the theatrical release, compounded with the problems with long term storage and that there wouldn't be much of an improvement in quality.  All I expected were a few additional scenes and perhaps a slighly cleaner picture.  How wrong could I be!<br />The picture is extremely sharp.  It's hard to believe the earlier releases were from the same film.<br />For those of you who still own an older release, and are wondering if it's worth the expense of buying another release (and a more expensive one at that), BUY THIS DVD.  You will not believe it until you see it with your own eyes.  This is truly a top notch restoration.
B00005JKPF|5.0|This movie is a winner in my book. It starts off with a mutant that was not in the first movie. Nightcrawler is a mutant who can teleport. He looks like a demon in the movie with his pointed ears and pointed tail, but we find in the movie that he is a deeply religious character. The scenes with Nightcrawler I think are the best, because of all the action, and the special effects are amazing. You also with get introduced to more mutants that were not in the first one including Pyro, who can manipulate fire. You got Lady Deathstrike who has metal claws that come out of the tips of her fingers. There is no Gambit in this movie. <br />The most suprising thing in the movie was the attack on the mutant school run by Professor Xavier. You get to see some mutants in small roles, including a girl who can walk through walls, and fall through the floors, there is a kid who can change the tv station by blinking, a girl who screams so loud it breaks glass, and shakes the ground, and a boy that is about to get shot who suddenly has metal covering his entire body.<br />The title of the movie tells you a lot \\"X-Men United\\". In this movie Wolverine, Nightcrawler, Cyclops, Storm, Jean Grey, Iceman, Rogue, and Pyro join forces with Magneto and Mystique, to take back the Cerebro technology that was stolen from the mutant school. <br />I recommend this movie to anyone. It is better than the first. It has more actions, more mutants, and a better plot than the original.
B00003CX9E|5.0|This film has been at or near the top of just about every reviewer's list of the &quot;Greatest Films of All Time&quot; for a long time, so I'm not going to add anything by just talking about how great the film is.  Everyone knows it's a great film, so I'll leave it at that.<br />However, the DVD itself is something worth talking about.  It's packaged as a Special Edition, and it contains a ton of extra materials, which I found to be just as interesting as the film itself.  Specifically, the extra information including &quot;The Battle over Citizen Kane&quot; are worth the price of the DVD alone.  There are so many interesting stories behind the scenes about the film itself that you will never see the film the same way again.
0792151712|4.0|Of course everyone knows the story of the world's biggest cruise liner that sunk on April 14, 1912 after hitting an iceberg. In 1997, James Cameron had spent over $200 Million dollars into creating one of the greatest disaster movies of all time. This movie is the best out of the many other films about Titanic that captured the scare, the disaster and the special effects like no other. The movie provided an excellent cast and crew.<br />The movie starts out in the present day when some explorers are 12,000 deep in the Atlantic Ocean looking at the famous ship's grave. Then they find a drawing of a woman that they show on TV and the actual woman, Rose Calvert calls them and she goes out to their ship and tells her story of Titanic.<br />Now we travel back to 1912 and it is half and hour before Titanic's departure from Southampton, England. Inside a bar are four men playing poker with Titanic tickets as the bet. The main guy, Jack Dawson (DiCapprio) wins and aboards the ship in third class. In first class is Rose (Winslet) and her rude and rich fiance Cal (Billy Zane). The two meet and start to fall in love. Now they become extremely attached to one another and here is where the events start to hit the fan.<br />At about 11:15 PM the two are kissing on the front deck of the ship when the Titanic hits the Iceberg. Now the ship is going to sink. PANIC EVERYWHERE! Even worse. THERE AREN'T ENOUGH LIFE BOATS FOR EVERYONE! Half the people on the ship are going to die. Now the two are stuck on the boat without any lifeboats left along with the other 1,500 people.<br />The effects of the ship sinking are utterly amazing. From the boats near by the people witness half the ship sticking out of the water at a 60 degree angle in total distress, shock and tears. Then finally the lights go out. Total darkness with a ship sinking. Imagine that. Then the SHIP SPLITS IN HALF!!! The back half of the ship falls hundreds on feet back down onto the water. We see the people on the stern holding on as they fall backwards. Then the boat finally breaks apart and the back half is on a complete vertical angle. Oh, my God!<br />See what'll happens next. Who survives out of the 1,500 that were left in the freezing water after Titanic was finally gone? Will Jack and Rose survive (Remember, they're in that water too)? Purchase the movie that made everyone travel back to 1912 and experience that horrifying night. The shipwreck of the world's greatest ship...TITANIC.holding on as they fall backwards.

0140042520|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Kerouac drew me into a magical world of his creation. Filled with memorable characters, this book is an uncommonly delightful easy-read that makes a cover to cover read very tempting. As often happens to me when I read a good book, I was sad the book had ended, and eager to read more Kerouac (I think I'll try &quot;on the road next.) This is definitely a book I find worthy of owning as I feel I will be drawn to it over and over again.
B00003CXTF|4.0|Remember the stories that you've heard about that day, December 7, 1941? Remember the stories you've heard about when the United States of America was attacked by Japan? This movie explains it all in explicit detail along with the outstanding special effects. The movie lets you experience the real-life events that occured on that morning in Hawaii. Michael Bay did a great job bringing this movie to life along with the crew and cast members.<br />The movie starts out with two best friends: Rafe McCawley (Affleck) and Daniel Walker (Harnett) who are training for air combat in Rhode Island. The date right now is January 1941. Rafe has to go to England to fight in RAF of England against Germany (Rememeber, World War II is being fought in Europe even though the US isn't in the war yet).<br />Meanwhile back in Japan, the Japanese are planning the attack. It is pretty interesting how we see them planning this. They have a small pool with several floating plastic battleships all grouped next to each other just the way the ships are positioned at Pearl to see how they should attack. Then they show us how they altered the propelers on their air torpedoes so they can travel through the shallow water at Pearl.<br />Back in Washington D.C. the Naval Intelligence is trying to find Japan's two missing carrier fleets that are somewhere in the Pacific. They have some hunches but never give a warning until the morning of the attack. Now at Pearl, Rafe is BACK the night before the attack.<br />Now it's 7 A.M. on December 7th. Japan's 320 planes are heading straight towards Pearl. Everyone is sleeping and playing golf completely unaware of the attack. Here come all the planes flying less than fifty feet above the ground right by everyone and they're wondering what's going on. Now, the planes are surrounding battle ship row and the few men on deck either reading the paper or sweeping are looking up at the gunners and high level bombers surrounding them also wondering what's going on? They are all staring at the planes in shock. Now the first torpedo is dropped in the water. Here it goes traveling through the crystal clear water and it hits the first ship. Everyone wakes up! \\"We're being BOMBED! We're being BOMBED! GET UP!\\" Now all the planes are either shooting guns at all the men or the ships are being bombed. Remember that famous ship, The Arizona where over 1,000 men were trapped in when it sunk? Well, we see a Japanese high-level bomber drop a bomb on it and it blows up. The explosion looks like a big wave. The explosion of it is so INTENSE!<br />Away from battleship row are the airfields. All the US's planes and bombers are being blown to pieces. Meanwhile Rafe and Daniel are going to a mechanic airfield that hasn't been attacked to they can get in the air and fight back. See if they can with over 300 planes bombing Pearl.<br />Back in Washington D.C. the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt (Voigt) is in total shock. The day after, December 8th, FDR makes his famous speech, \\"Yesterday, December 7, 1941. A date which will live in infamy. The United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the empire of Japan (FDR Decemeber 8th).\\" Now only one thing is one everyone of the US's mind.: WAR!!! See what the US will do to avenge Pearl Harbor. This movie has it all. The movie is full of outstanding special effects, great action-packed scenes and is definately another great History movie.

0783229526|5.0|When I first saw this film, I knew nothing about Hunter S. Thompson, I hadn't yet read the book, or any of the articles he wrote, the more I learn about Thompson, the more I love this film. The Portarayal of Hunter S. Thompson (AKA Duke)by Johnny Depp is truly amazing. If one compares footage of the actual Thompson with the Thompson brought to life by Depp, one can immeaditely appreciate the acting skill involved and that alone should be enough to watch this film. The film avoids becoming a watered-down version of the book. I read the book and watched the movie and they are very much alike. <BR>This film is truly in the unique Thompson &quot;Gonzo&quot; style. The film has a point, but the humor runs the spectrum from sarcastic wit to silliness.
B00006G8LB|5.0|This real-life comic book movie, Spiderman is outstandingly fantastic. Tobey Maguire did an excellent job as Peter Parker/Spiderman. Along with him was Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson, who Peter is desperately in love with. Willem Dafoe did great playing the evil villan, the Green Goblin. The movie is full of action-packed special effects, great action scenes and full of adventure.<br />The movie starts out with Peter Parker (Maguire), a high school science nerd who everyone constantly picks on (even the bus driver). The first scene is Peter chasing his school bus down the street and the bus driver keeps going just to annoy him. On his fieldtrip with classmates to a science lab, a genetically altered spider that escaped from the lab comes down from a web and bites his hand while taking pictures. Now he goes home to get some rest. The next morning he wakes up and the first weird thing he notices is when he puts his glasses on he can't see. When he takes them off he can see perfectly (Remember: Spiders can't see with glasses). The next thing he notices is all of-a-sudden his body is ripped. He is suddenly very muscular like. Imagine that. The next weird thing that happens is when he chases his bus AGAIN, his hand touches the sign on the bus and it rips off with his hand. His hand is sticky (Spider's have sticky hands for gripping). It's pretty cool what happens at school with these powers. See what happens there. Now he leaves school in shock and starts to climb an alley wall with his bare hands like a Spider. Then he jumps over twenty feet building to building and then tests his web by flying with it over a gap of fifty feet. Cool! To put his powers to the test, he enrolls in a wrestling match against Macho Man Randy Savage. Will he win?<br />Here is where the stuff hits the fan. Peter's friend Harry's father Norman Osborn is the founder os Oscorp, a science lab that invents weapons for the military. After a he does a experiment on himself to enhance human strength, it goes bad. He has an evil side now and he becomes the Green Goblin. He first blows up a test sight for some military hovercraft. Now at a huge fair that Oscorp sponsors he attacks everyone. He attempts to destroy a balcony full of people, including Harry and Mary Jane. Here comes Spiderman. The start to bash it out. Right now Spiderman wins and saves Mary Jane. Next, at the Daily Bugle where Peter works as a photographer, the Green Goblin comes and demands to know who takes the photos of Spiderman. Spiderman shows up and the Green Goblin makes Spiderman fall asleep with some kind of gas. Goblin offers Spiderman a truce to join forces and of course he turns it down.<br />Now that Spiderman turned the offer down, the Goblin finds out who he is and goes after the people he loves. Here is the final bash. Goblin has Spiderman at his knees because on top of the Brooklyn bridge, Goblin holds Mary Jane over on edge of the bridge on one side. On the other side, he holds a wire that is connected to a transportation cab full of people. He drops both. NOW HERE GOES SPIDERMAN! Can he actually do both? Now I'll let you know Goblin is really angry that he lost. Now they finally have it out. First Goblin drops a small bomb next to Spiderman and cuts him badly and rips half his mask off. Now he has to use his Spider webs to pull a wall down on Goblin and it comes down to the last straw. To the DEATH! Punch after punch Spiderman attacks Goblin. Now, I'll let you see for yourself how Spiderman saves the day.<br />I hope this review is very helpful to you. If you like Spiderman you have to see this real-life movie. Excellent Special Effects! Excellent Action Scenes! Also an EXCELLENT job by the actors. Especially Maguire and Dafoe. See how Spiderman went from being a nerd to a Superhero., it goes bad.

0880389052|5.0|In the beginning, before there was the noble warrior Drizzt, there was the confused, lonely young drow Drizzt. Trapped in a world which he knew was false, Drizzt struggles with an inborn sense of morality which he can't justify to the world around him. Finally coming to stand for what he knows to be true, Drizzt leaves his home to defy the evil society he was raised in, something his father Zaknafein was never able to do.<br />Drizzt is the ultimate warrior. Kind in a world that hates kindness, a two handed warrior of epic proportions, Drizzt fights physically and mentally for what he knows in his heart is right. The thing that dooms him to his people is the very thing that saves him. His mercy.<br />Zaknafein is everything his son is, only without the willpower to leave his world. Zak goes from loathing his son, who he fears will become just as evil as his kin, and loving him when he sees his own attributes even stronger in his son. Zak's ultimate sacrifice is touching and tragic at once.<br />Malice and her evil daughters, who form an unholy trinity, is a thing out of nightmares, as is the godess she worships. There is no fiber of human kindness in her. She is pure evil. <br />Salvatore has crafted a beautiful beginning for a character who is obviously his favorite and rightfully his signature. Fascinating in a way I've come to no expect in modern fantasy, if it involves Drizzt and Salvatore, it will be worth reading.
B00000IAU3|5.0|This CD has a permanant spot in my CD changer.  The songs within range from hauntingly beautiful to sorrowful, but always sublime.  I am not aware of any marketing hype regarding this CD, just my own pure enjoyment!  I bought copies for more than a few friends and family, all of whom were hesitant to enjoy the CD, but once they played it, Enjoy it they did!  There is no real way to characterize Dido's music, aside from saying that once you listen, you will never forget it!  This is not a CD of uplifting tunes and the lyrics will not make you Happy, happy, happy....just glad you bought the CD.  I think every stlye of music is represented here (a good thing), from jazz, soul, a little folk and easy listening, and the instrumental blend is easy and smooth.  If you are 20 years old and have only had good things happen in your life, go look at hip hop, rap and dance music.  If you have had a life and are glad of it, buy this CD.

B00006BTCA|4.0|First of all, it's kind of blasphemous to just toss off comparisons to Joy Division.  It takes a little more than a deep voice and minimalist approach to earn that reputation.  The post-punk energy isn't consistent through the whole album, but this definitely has merit.  The songs are not heavy-hitters all the way through either, but Obstacle 1 and PDA(to mention only two) are great.  Haven't been able to get these out of my head for days.  In case you're trying to sort through the recent NYC  hype, you are much better off buying this than the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, etc.  A couple of magazines said the release of this record was the death rattle of the NYC scene.  No way.  It's just a classic case of the most talented and creative group getting passed over because everyone's paying attention to the guys that make more noise.  Very promising debut...hope they live up to the expectations!  This disc is worth picking up.

0062502182|1.0|It has wisely been said Nothing succeeds like success. Coelho proves the validity of the theorem. His Alchemist is a masterpiece of how to write a best seller. Simply, follow what has worked before. The basic rules are five. 1. Have a hero of wide appeal. 2. Have a story most people can identify with. 3. Appeal to the heart. 4. Have a happy ending.  And (and this is really the GOLDEN rule) 5. Keep it simple. This is the formula that brought us JL Seagull. <br />On to The Alchemist. Everybody knows stories about children sell, that will do. So this book is about Santiago, a  Spanish teenager. Who is he? Umm, make him a shepherd, that has worked before. Also has many positive connotations attached to it. What is he to do? Must be something admirable - but not too far fetched, so we can all identify with it. So Santiago is to follow his heart and set out on a quest to realise his dream - who among us would disagree with such a noble pursuit? It is something youngsters would like to do while for the older it brings back sweet sabbatical memories. But what exactly is Santiago to do? Easy, he is to journey to the Pyramids to discover a hidden treasure. Beautiful, it unites the romantics of the world. Set everything in an undetermined period to avoid unnecessary research and allow creative latitude and youre ready for characterisation and plot.<br />Here Coelho goes a bit wrong. His supporting cast is a bit one-dimensional and the plot follows the simplicity rule too rigidly. But overall, Coelho succeeds admirably. He improves on the success of Love Story by avoiding the pitfall of a somewhat Western-hemisphere story and a sad ending. His hero comes perilously close to death but he not only survives, he finds his treasure. He also gets the girl; Fatima, whom he has met in the desert and fallen in love with, has pledged to wait for him until he returns from his quest.<br />I am actually quite impressed by the way Coelho furthers the appeal of his book. He expertly laces a western-culture message of You are the master of your destiny on an Oriental background of things predetermined and evidenced by omens. An amazing feat, with the result that both Western Executives and fate-believing Easterners proclaim this to be their favourite book. Coelho is also careful not to overclarify his heros objective. If you are so inclined, you can very well see Santiagos quest as a one of self-discovery and improvement. A touch of spirituality does wonders for sales these days.<br />All the elements are there, then. But Coelhos major achievement is not so much his adherence to the formula as his treatment of it. He focuses on the word simple with exemplary single-mindedness. It is not just the story, nothing else in this book is taxing. The language is easy, conversational even: no uncommon words, no artistic syntax, no long phrases. And its length (less than 170 pages even with big-point size characters) means you can read it in one sitting. With the Alchemist Coelho truly gives the word simple new-found depth. It is the only deep thing in this book.
B000069HJN|5.0|When this one-of-a-kind pop rock band released their chart-topping hit album, &quot;Breakfast In America&quot; in 1979, critics claimed that Supertramp could become, quote, &quot;the best-sounding art-rock band in existence&quot; if they centered in on the sophisticated English pop they had become renowned for. But in an act of near bravery, Supertramp denied the critics and continued to move in a more bluesier direction, which soon resulted in the departure of primary co-songwriter Roger Hodgson. The decision to forge on with a much more R&amp;B flavored sound cost the band a crucial member, a piece of their fan-base, not to mention most of their popular acclaim and record sales, but perhaps these hard facts make 1985's &quot;Brother Where You Bound&quot; so unique.<br />This set captures the now four-man Supertramp at the start of a new era, led by songwriter Rick Davies, rounded out by veteran members Dougie Thomson, John Helliwell, and Bob Siebenberg. Bravely discarding the advice and obvious perferences of their critics, they created a maverick piece of work. From track one, Supertramp grabs your attention with the gripping, lovelorn suite 'Cannonball.' From there, the band adds their trademark sense of sophistication and style, with the mysteriously poignant 'No Inbetween,' and especially the title track, one of the band's most accomplished and intriguing songs, as the album is wrapped up with the glimmers of 'Ever Open Door.'<br />However, the door was actually closed with this promising set; &quot;Brother Where You Bound&quot; was Supertramp's last album to enter the top 40, and subsequent releases would find only modest success. Nonetheless, the quality would remain the same. A hard price to pay for such great music.

This is a spectacularily unexpurgated edition of the book of not just his life, but ours, and it's wonderful.  <BR>      He makes his experiences on Speed one of the most splendid events I could ever imagine going through: \\"`I'm thinking of parceling off portions of my brain,` I once told her. `I'm not talking about having anything surgically removed, I'd just like to divide it into lots and lease it out so that people can say `I've got a house in Raleigh, a cottage in Myrtle Beach, and a little hideaway inside a visionary's head.`  Her bored expression suggested the questionable value of my mental real estate.\\"  <BR>  Sedaris is not only a master at self-deprecating humor but he manages to strip his family of their protection and cover of normalcy as well whilst successfully expressing their mutual bonds as a clearly deep and affectionate family who warms your heart: \\"My mother was, for the most part, delighted with my brother and regarded him with the bemused curiosity of a brood hen discovering she has hatched a completely different species.  'I think it was very nice of Paul to give me this vase,' she once said, arranging a bouquet of wildflowers into the skull-shaped bong my brother had left on the dining-room table. 'It's non-traditional, but that's Rooster's way.  He's a free spirit, and we're lucky to have him.'\\"  It's this funny, ALL THE WAY, people.  Articulate, brutally honest, and blatantly hilarious, you'll find no better.  The review done by Amazon.com really helps in describing what this book will give you as well.  You really can't go wrong.  Reap the benefits and GET IT!!!
B00000K413|5.0|Note: Janov's work was called &quot;Primal Therapy,&quot; not &quot;primal scream therapy.&quot; THE PRIMAL SCREAM was just the name of his first book! This group formed to save money to go to The Primal Institute, so the rumor has it -- but they became so successful they never made it. But they garnered much insight and probably would up processing a lot of memories/feelings themselves. This is actually quite a bit more musically progressive-sounding than their follow-up album. Love it -- one of the best, most cohering records of all time.
0140042520|5.0|I read Kerouac's novel The Dharma Bums &amp; I must say I liked it very much! The story is about two young men as they set out in search of truth. They are Ray Smith and Japhy Ryder (Jack Kerouac &amp; Gary Snyder). These two meet up in San Francisco, California at Berkeley. They attend a bohemian party and poetry jamming (The Gallery Six Reading). This was the beat generation of the 50s &amp; 60s. <br />Japhy Ryder liked reading Zen books such as Diamond Sutra and also works by D.T.Suzuki. He was seeking his Bodhisattvas in everyone he met. Japhy would often quote Buddha: (\\"All life is suffering&quot;.) <br />Their goal was to climb Desolation Peak. The solitude was their Satori. Dharma Bums is a great story of adventurer. I also recommend On The Road by Jack Kerouac as well.
B000092Q4U|5.0|Over the past year or so I have seen my taste in music gravitate to the heavier side of things and CD's like this are the very reason for it... First off, it kinda goes without saying but, the drumming on this disc (and New American Gospel as well) is absolutely fantastic... none of that \\"endless blast beat\\" ... here! The guitars have bite and the vocals are arresting... far from being an indistinct growl, the vocals are intense but understandable (well mostly *grin*) <br />Point of fact: this is real metal, real music, r e a l good! If metal is your cup of tea, then defintely pick this one up and chug it! :-)
B00005JLWN|4.0|This is a solid, well-acted, action-packed film that holds it own despite its comparisons to such movies as The Matrix, 1984 and Fahrenheit-451, just to name a few.<br />After WW3, a totalitarian govt. seeks to eliminate wars, violence, crimes, etc. by stifling emotions and materialistic possessions that fuel those emotions. Christian Bale (American Psycho, Shaft) plays the best of the best of law enforcement who makes sure those who break the laws are punished...that is, until the tables are turned on him. <br />Bale plays the hard-lined, emotionless cleric turned &quot;sense offender&quot; to perfection, and it's great to see him play the hero. The movie is also loaded with familiar faces: Taye Diggs, Sean Bean (Lord of the Rings), Sean Pertwee (Dog Soldiers, Event Horizon, Soldier) and Angus McFadyen (Braveheart).<br />The film starts out slow, but holds one's interest enough to get you to the end, which is where the action really kicks in. Filled with well-choreographed, real-time action sequences to rival that of The Matrix, &quot;Equilibrium&quot; is a satisfying sci-flick well worth the viewing effort.

B00000K19E|5.0|This movie is so good it's not even funny. It's got great actors, an awesome plot, great action, great special effects. This movie has everything. The first time I saw this was when I was 10. It amazed me and I couldn't wait for the sequels. If you don't have a copy of the DVD, you're missing out on one of the best movies ever. In order to get the full experience, you need the DVD. It's got great sound (5 out of 5) and great anamorphic widescreen picture quality (5 out of 5). This movie is AWESOME!!!!
1573220167|3.0|After a conversation where I started to describe my extremely emotional reaction to the movie &lt;i&gt;High Fidelity&lt;/i&gt; (set in Chicago, with the Kusacks'), a good friend told me to go read the book. Well, how could I say no to her? (hell, how can I say no to any woman? But that is not the discussion...)<br />Overall, it was a good book. It seemed to be slow in parts. But I connected to the character, having lived in England for a few years (just before the book was published). I knew what they were talking about &amp; where, which helped me read the book. I have not been reading much fiction lately; hell I have never read much fiction.<br />Overall it followed the theme of the book, but it was adapted for the states &amp; a stateside setting along with our feeble Americanized minds. Not the emotional response I was expecting, certainly not the response the movie provokes out of me. This would be a definite read the book before watching the move. I found myself comparing the book to the movie the whole way through, which was distracting as all hell. Quite a few say they see themselves when reading this book - I did not see that when reading the book.<br />Why is that the main character proposes getting married because he does not want to \\"fight\\" anymore, not wanting to try finding 'the one'? WTF was that? Oh, I will just settle for you then....<br />I finished the book in Chicago, when I was up there for a conference. Weird how the movie was set there, and that is where I think about some of my exes.<br />A light read, that you will easily get through in a short time. Most likely asking why &amp; putting your own top five list together.
B00005JKN9|3.0|This film is bloated by at least a half an hour. Leonardo DiCaprio is woefully miscast. Cameron Diaz's character is not only extraneously adrift in this male-orientated film, but also jarringly contemporary. The film's ploting is eye-rollingly obvious; Henry Thomas' character's true motivations are laughably blatant from his introduction onwards, and the 'fever-pitch' resolution and its denoument are soporifically dissapointing, containing an alarmingly high 'Oh, get on with it!' quotient. The film does redeem itself somewhat by its sufficiently grandiose pretensions, although striped pants and bowler hats and a parade of silly period get-ups have never looked particularly menacing. The political allusions are murky as well, drawing rather tenuous parallels with contemporary New York. <br />Proceed, but watch furtively.
B0000026KQ|5.0|I can't say all that I think about this album in few lines. This album is simply perfect from a musical standpoint. From a guitar enthusiast point of view is a never ending lesson. Jeff Beck  is the man with the touch. In the eighties, or early nineties, I can't remember when this album came out, all the guitar players were trying to be shredders in order to emulate Steve Vai or Yngwie. Beck  completly change the perspective with Guitar shop and remember to the few who did forget, who is the real man and why.  He remebered to us all the importance of notes choice,  of touch, of expression when all were trying to reach the speed of light. I remember that I saw him one night in TV at an Atlantic party. There were all these blues guitar legends on the bandstand Clapton, BB King, Johnny Winter, Jimmy Page and Jeff  was called to join in. He went on the bandstand and completly blew them all away with just a bend and a vibrato with his whammy. Those guys were there in silence listening to Beck doing their thing better than how much they have ever dream to do. On of the things that  I really appreciate in Beck is his stature as a true artist. He is never tired of experimenting with music, trying to figure out new ways of expressions, never be afraid of taking risks. This is how a great artist should be.<br />Moreover he's always been the coolest player around, he did launch trends. The telecaster come back was related to the People get ready video where he was playing that beat up nocaster. The super strat eighties trend was related to his Ambitious video. He always set the standard in terms of playing, attitude, image. Turning back to this album, it is simply phenomenal. Each track is a masterpiece in energy, soul, technique. Terry Bozzio behind the drums is simply amazing.  The idea of recording without a bass player was courageous but in my opinion it paid.  Unfortunatly albums like this one are rare birds. El Becko is in the all times guitar players Rushmore mountain.
B00003CXBH|3.0|Roland Joffe's \\"The Mission\\" can, with hindsight, be seen as the first directoral misstep by a filmmaker who has subsequently been slumming it (\\"The Scarlet Letter\\", anyone?). This film has all the individual ingredients of a rousing, heartfelt masterpiece: Ennio Morricone's eponymous, redolent score, Chris Menges' strikingly mounted, symbolically saturated cinematography, Robert Bolt's erudite, literate and high-minded screenplay (apparently penned years earlier as a David Lean project) and a director just off from a round of plaudits for the excellent \\"The Killing Fields\\". Although the film has a number of isolated merits, the end product is a resolute dissapointment. <br />The opening sequence, a missionary attached to a cross making his way towards oblivion by way of a thunderous waterfall, masterfully segueing into Ennio Morricone's majestic theme; Jeremy Iron's Jesuit priest making his way up that same waterfall; the montage conveying the construction of the mission; the well placed use of Ray MacAnnalay's ambiguously doting, melancholy voice over, amongst others. The irony is that the film's major flaws result from these moments: the constant crescendo of emotional peaks, swelling violins, etc. combined with a narrative which contains such an obvious, inevitable conclusion, underscores most of the film's dramatic power.<br />The ending itself is a mess; it is badly choreographed (the soldier extra's don't seem to know in which direction to point their cannons and guns), with De Niro and Irons (as well as the Indian extra's) temporally confused as if their faculties have  been clouded by langorous jungle narcotics. It seems rushed, probably due to its judiciously hurried inclusion in the 1987 Cannes Film Festival roster (it did win the 'Palme D'Or', granted). <br />Overall, a noble failure.
B000002MUW|4.0|Out of the several studio albums Madonna has cranked out over the last 20 years, \\"Bedtime Stories\\" is probably the least referred to and least talked about. In all actuality, this was a very crucial album in Madonna's career. She was coming off of the \\"Erotica\\" scandel and the public backlash of the early 90's and this album was the response. <br />\\"Bedtime Stories\\" is a very kick-back R&B album. The first track \\"Survival\\" is a great R&B track and very cool. \\"Secret\\" was the 1st single and hit #2 on the pop chart and a very sexy groove track. \\"Don't Stop\\" is a definite favorite of mine and adds a little dance flavor. \\"Human Nature\\" was also a single and is Madonna's response to the critics that claimed her career was over. I love \\"Forbidden Love.\\" It's a very sultry ballad and also made an appearance on \\"Something To Remember.\\" \\"Bedtime Story\\" is mostly memorable for the video. The song itself was co-written by Bjork which explains its weirdness. And finally, the album closes with \\"Take A Bow\\" which despite the lesser commercial success that this album experienced, \\"Take A Bow\\" was one of Madonna's biggest hits and definitely her biggest hit of the 90's hitting #1. <br />Although albums I like the \\"Like A Virgin\\" and \\"Like A Prayer\\" albums a lot more, this is still an awesome record. It managed to show off Madonna's sultry and sexy side in a much more toned down manner than she had earlier in the decade.
B00005B36H|3.0|When I first got this CD, i didn't particularly like it, as I had been spoiled by AEnima and undertow.  After having had about a year to listen to it, i've changed my tune.  The songs have very complex structures and are very catchy.  Maynard's lyrical genius once again shines thru as he writes some of the most complex poetry i've heard.  Very abstract and calculated.
0783225849|5.0|If you are interested in filmmaking or just want to see one of the best horror/thriller films ever made, rent the original &quot;Psycho.&quot; This film is beautifully crafted from one of the most respected directors of all time, Alfred Hitchcock.
0451457994|4.0|2001 is a wonderful achievement. It's pace is much faster than 2001 the movie, yet still manages a slow feel, as a book should in the space environment. Yet, after watching the film, with its<BR>Strauss and Kucrick aplenty, the literature seems dwarfed to a microscopical size. But read the book first so it wont be spoiled for you.<br /> When it comes to the style of Clarke's writing in this book, you'll find it so explicit that you expect the left in the air ending of the film to be answered just as Clarke explains the monolith directing the apes to perform simple tasks to test their intelligence and potential. But, alas, the ending is in ways more mysterious than the film. But Clarke adds a few more situations to the book, such as a comet fly-by and some looks into the minds of the characters (the infamous personality-drained characters that Clarke has created for your enjoyment). So, those who have already seen the film should see this as the best movie companion ever created in the history of time. So I would at least reccomend it.
0316666343|5.0|The situation in this book is so realistist.  Rape happens all the time, and the scenerio in this book is something that could really happen.  Its sad to read about how much of life she missing out on, I can't even imagine dieing.  It's hard to believe they didn't know the murderer at first.  It was hard for family and friends.  Reading this book makes me think twice before I do things.
0446677450|3.0|Although clear, Kiyosaki's work is hardly concise, he is repetitive in his coverage of singular points, becoming needlessly redundant. The content of his point however, is valuable advice for a young person, not yet familiar with the world of finances.  It is a good book for employed teenagers to take a look at, there is a great deal of good advice to be found in Kiyosaki's book for youth to get themselves on the right track to financial security later in life.
0689859368|5.0|All the things a kid could ever want in a book--Faeries, Goblins, secret rooms, and a quick read to boot. I frequent the library, but felt these books were so fantastic I had to buy copies of my own. The illustrations by Tony DiTerlizzi are wonderful, and I found myself eager to turn each page to see the next picture, as well as to read what would happen in the story. The style of the books are eerily similar to that of Lemony Snicket-- there are three siblings who find themselves in some sort of trouble or danger in each book, a letter from the author, and a snippet on the back of each book with reasons why you shouldn't read the story. Still, the events in the books were very original and kept me entertained. I can't wait for the rest of the series to be released (there are five books total). A must read!!
B0000640VN|4.0|I watched the Director's Cut version of the film on DVD and never saw this in the theater, so I'm not sure how many changes there were between the two versions.  The major change, I believe is the relationship between Hugh Jackman's character and Liev Schrieber.  In the Director's cut, Leopold (Jackman) is the ancestor of Stuart (Schrieber).  In the theatrical release, there is no mention of this relationship.  This changes the dynamic of the film in that Stuart wouldn't have nearly as much motivation in his actions as he does in the director's cut.  I'm getting ahead of myself, though.<br />Once more, I must mention that this review is for the Director's Cut of Kate and Leopold.  The movie opens in the 1800's.  A bridge is just being built (I believe the Brooklyn Bridge, but I don't believe it is ever said).  Leopold is at the dedication ceremony.  He notices a man snickering behind him and turns to look.  He sees this man (turns out to be Stuart) take a picture with a tiny (and I do mean tiny) camera.  This is out of place and Stuart takes off running.  Leopold gives chase but is unable to catch him.  Next we see Leopold at home, at a party, and he sees Stuart one more time and he gives chase again.  This time he catches up to Stuart but they both fall from a bridge.  Flash forward to our time and Kate (Meg Ryan) appears.  She lives one floor below her ex-boyfriend, Stuart.  Stuart calls her and says that he has actually traveled through time but accidentally brought back his great grandfather.<br />Still angry at her ex, Kate does not believe his story nor does she believe that Leopold is really from 1867.  However, because of the close proximity of their apartments, and Stuart's later accident, Kate and Leopold interact more and more often and become friends.  Boy meets girl, you know the story.  It is a simple story and the time travel isn't nearly as important as you might think.  Yes, it plays a major role, but it really is nothing more than a device.  This is a romantic comedy and time travel is only there so two people can meet.  It brings a different twist to the film, but make no mistake, the emphasis is on the romance between Kate and Leopold, two people from very different worlds and social classes.  The film is ultimately about \\"meant to be\\", just like any other romantic comedy.<br />The movie was nothing special, but is lighthearted and enjoyable.  While you may forget what you watched a few days later, this was an enjoyable and fun little movie.is is a romantic comedy and time travel is only there so two people can meet.

B00005JKMQ|5.0|Will Smith playing Muhammad Ali?  Yes, indeed, and surprisingly enough, he does a fantastic job.  While he doesn't look too much like Ali, Will Smith bulked up and did a credible job in the ring as Ali (isn't film wonderful?).  Where Will Smith really shone was outside the ring, getting to perform as Ali the man.  It is in the human portrayal of Muhammad Ali that Will Smith disappears and we can believe that it truly is Ali himself.<br />Ali was directed by Michael Mann (The Insider, The Last of the Mohicans) and the movie has a slow, deliberate pacing that perfectly serves the film.  We get to savor the moments on screen instead of being rushed to the next bit of Ali spitting out beautiful dialogue in rhyme.  While it is equally as important to have Ali talking as it is to have him fighting, the scenes that linger a moment or two longer than one might expect help give the overall tone to the film.  The perfect example of this is the scene where Ali is dancing with the woman who would become his first wife.  The scene is perfectly captured, slowly dancing to the music and it really puts the emotion into the scene.  Holding the shot longer helped the scene and the movie.<br />The movie begins with young Cassius Clay preparing to fight Sonny Liston for the first time and for the championship.  The film follows his life and career through Ali winning the championship, marriages (plural), changing his name from Cassius Clay to Muhammad Ali, refusing the draft, the Ali-Frazier fight, and finally ends with the Rumble in the Jungle against George Foreman.<br />I don't know very much about the life of Muhammad Ali, so I can't comment on the accuracy of the film.  Without that knowledge, I can only judge \\"Ali\\" on its own merits.  This is a fine film with excellent performances (Jon Voight as Howard Cosell stands out, as does Will Smith) and is without question is worth watching.
0375758992|4.0|Alexandra Fuller, Don't let's go to the dogs tonight. An African Childhood.<br />Alexandra Fuller's book, Don't let's go to the dogs tonight, relates the story of the author's childhood in Africa through the eyes of the child she was. It's the kind of book I read more slowly towards the end, in an attempt to make the pleasure last. I also kept rereading certain passages and turning back to the small pictures adorning the book, almost with the impression that they represented old friends.<BR>Although Fuller's childhood in Africa could be qualified as harsh and even deeply tragic, her tone is unsentimental and at the same time deeply moving. She describes events and<BR>people with great candour and the result is often extremely funny. Certain scenes, like the visit of two American missionaries to her parents' remote farm, made me laugh out loud.<BR>This book is much more than just another childhood biography. It touches on a lot of political subjects and documents the losing battle for white supremacy in Africa. In the end, the relentless struggle for survival of a family of white farmers, first in war-torn Rhodesia, later in Malawi and in Zambia takes on almost mythical proportions. It epithomises the struggle of man against<BR>nature, of mind against madness in the beloved and dreaded continent one can feel, smell and taste on every page.
B00005ATQI|4.0|THE SHINING is adapted from a Stephen King novel about a family whose father serves as caretaker of a summer resort hotel in Colorado during the winter. Jack Nicholson has the role of Jack Torrance, the slightly manic dad who goes completely insane as his life and those of his wife and son systematically spin out of control. To say that Jack Nicholson dominates the movie is an understatement.<br />The only relief is provided by Scatman Crothers who furnishes a welcome counterweight to Nicholson. Scatman is a tower of strength and stability who almost saves the film from becoming too much Jack.<br />Another memorable character is the hotel itself which takes possession of Nicholson and drives him crazy. It is hard to imagine a more forbidding and desolate place. Additional members of the cast include Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd and Barry Nelson.<br />THE SHINING received no Oscar nominations. The big award winners in 1980 were ORDINARY PEOPLE, RAGING BULL and COAL MINER'S DAUGHTER.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina has truly made an extordinary come back to the music industry.  I bought this album back in November about the second week it came out.

B000089RW0|1.0|As if Dark Castle Entertainment didn't learn its lesson yet, GHOST SHIP is by far the worst film to date to be released by the company.  They also produced the remakes of HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL and THIRTEEN GHOSTS.  Both were equally terrible films in their own right, but GHOST SHIP takes the cake.  If those two films were bad, GHOST SHIP achieves a new level of awfulness.  All I kept thinking while watching this film was how notable actors like Gabriel Byrne, Juliana Marguilles, and Isaiah Washington would degrade themselves in such a stupid movie?  The paycheck must've been tempting.  This movie does everything a horror movie should NOT do - it's slow, dull, boring, not scary, not interesting, and (worst of all) extremely predictable.  <br />Only the first 5 minutes of the movie are any good, as it shows us what happened to the crew of the Italian cruise ship The Antonia Graza in 1962.  The opening credits toy with us, starting off like some happy episode of \\"The Love Boat,\\" before the real terror (or lack thereof) starts.  A cable line snaps off and slices every single member and vacationer on board.  There's a brief pause and slowly every person begins to break in half or lose a head or lose an arm.  The little girl is the only one to survive.  It's not scary, but this very gory sequence achieve a creepy disturbance that the rest of the movie doesn't have.<br />The remaining 80 minutes or so of the movie are so deathly dull that I just wanted this thing to be over.  We know what's coming so sitting through this movie is pretty pointless.  Also, the so-called \\"surprise\\" twist at the end is too phony.  I mean, come on, I guessed right off the bat who the person was doing this.  You have to be blind not to have figured it out.  And not only that, the revelation that is shown about what really happened to the crew is not only uproraringly funny, but downright ridiculous.<br />GHOST SHIP is just a waste of time.  The special features on the DVD are OK, but it will just anger you even more considering how the filmmakers still managed to screw everything up.  Check out the original HALLOWEEN or the original A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET to see how horror is really done.  I don't think anyone will rememeber GHOST SHIP once you've left it alone - at the bottom of your DVD collection.

However, splitting Regatta de Blanc across two discs is inexcusable, and including susbstandard non-album tracks between albums is distracting.

B00008S2VG|5.0|I must say that I don't like the whole electronic phase Madonna has been going through, and still is, with Mirwais. When I first heard this record my reaction was: Mirwais messed up these songs pretty good with that electronic bull, cuz the melodies and songs are good but the sounds he puts in the songs are totally stupid. But then I listened to it more and I got passed that electronic thing I don't like and the record got more and more interesting. With Hollywood, Nothing Fails and X-static Process as my personal fave's it's got some cute songs on it. And I mean cute in the meaning of sweet. Nothing Fails and X-static Process are examples of these songs and it's obvious that Madonna is happy in her life and grateful for it.<br />Some people say that Madonna has gone TOO far this time.........with WHAT?! What's she doing wrong THIS time? I think she shouldn't have pulled back the video for American Life, but hey that's just my opinion. They also say that she's losing her audience and doesn't appeal to the youth. Well I'm 17 and I love that woman, even though she's my mother's age she's a big role model and I know I speak for LOADS of other women of my age. <br />I like this album better than Ray Of Light and Music and I hope she'll rock on for a long time. Madonna, you rock.

B00003CWOL|4.0|Or is that reverent blasphemy?  Dogma is that rare, refreshing film that actually is about ideas and belief, yet doesn't take itself too seriously at the same time.  Since I'm not Catholic I suspect I'm probably missing some of the jokes and religious connotations but that didn't bother me at all.  Kevin Smith fans (of which I'm one) can tell you the plot details and characters.  I'll just say this: Dogma is a film that makes you think about the deeper issues of religion and what being human is about, without the bathrobe-and-sandals posturing of your standard God-based movie. It's a film that takes its religious implications very seriously but with a wonderful shaggy dog presentation.  Sure there's some plot holes and pacing problems, but these are minor flaws in a seriously funny (and comically serious) movie that should raise both minds and discussions.
1558216847|5.0|The story in a nutshell:  A Polish Army officer is captured by the Soviets after they have joined Hitler in dismembering his country.  Rawicz (the officer) is tortured in the Soviet prison system and sent to the Gulags.  Faced with misery in Siberia and probable death, he and a band of others escape and undertake a two thousand-mile long journey from the snows of Siberia through Mongolia, the Gobi Desert, and across the Himalayas toward British India and freedom.<br />This is a great story.  The author describes the mindless torture under the Soviet system in a manner that should persuade any reader of the evil of totalitarianism.  The description of his train journey, hundred-mile winter hike through a Siberian winter to his gulag and life in the camp is fascinating.  His will to survive amidst degradation, the elements and overwhelming odds are a testament to the human thirst for freedom and liberty.<br />As other reviewers have stated, there are some parts of the book that invite skepticism.  His befriending by the camp commandant's wife seems as improbable as it is crucial to his ability to escape.  The escapees journey across the Gobi Desert where his group went for many days without water beyond what I understood a person could tolerate.  Without any climbing tools, his party went across the Himalayas to India -- a feat that seems fantastic.  Also his brief description of spotting what could only be described as the elusive Yetti in the Himalayas stretches credibility (unless it does actually exist).<br />That being said, this story is exhilarating and I found it believable and enthralling.  It is a wonderful adventure story and describes the limits of what the human spirit and mind can endure to survive in freedom.  This book has been around for almost fifty years and was given wide play when first introduced.  I'm going to assume the lack of anything debunking this widely told tale (or, anything that I could find) argues for the author's veracity -- certainly that frame of mind allows one to enjoy a stirring story.y that frame of mind allows one to enjoy a stirring story.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I`ve been a Madonna fan since 1984, and I have to say that her new album is a different an a mature new style.  I am agree that this is her most confident and personal job.  It`s a masterpiece and a future classic.
B00006RG9K|4.0|A few years ago I was able to purchase a VHS copy of this concert, but my VCR liked Genesis also, so it ate the tape a while later; therefore, I was delighted when I discovered, about a month ago, when this Genesis show was put on Region 1 DVD back in late fall of last year. On the surface, the two DVD set is fairly impressive.<BR>But there are a few things about both the content of the discs and the product packaging that are a bit confusing and, to an extent, misleading. First--and probably of most importance--is concerning the eight hours+ of concert footage. Because of the multiple camera angles, the concert may be viewed in up to sixteen different positions, with the concert itself being about two and a half hours long. However, before I knew the DVD of the show was available, the original (from 1993) VHS tape had behind-the-scenes footage of the concert, so I figured that the DVD had additional (eight hours+ worth of) behind-the-scenes footage--but the behind-the-scenes footage on the original tape was not included in the DVD set, though it should've been (and it's beyond me why it wasn't). There's some other stuff (one-sided interviews, a photo gallery, the original concert program, along with some other stuff I can't recall at the moment), but the supplemental stuff is of little value to me.<BR>I'm just glad to have the concert back and in such an improved A/V format (and I must admit that switching between camera angles is pretty cool)! Secondly, I suppose I will complain about the packaging. Because of the eight hours+ worth of differing camera angle footage, the concert had to be cut in half, putting (roughly) the first 1 hour and 15 minutes of the concert on disc 1 and putting (roughly) the second 1 hour and 15 minutes of the concert on disc 2. But the setlist on the packaging does NOT discern the content split (from \\"Land Of Confusion\\" to \\"Jesus He Knows Me\\", then the \\"intermission\\", then from \\"Dreaming While You Sleep\\" to \\"Turn It On Again\\"); instead,the setlist displays the concert as if it were whole (like it was on the original VHS tape). Although I dislike having to switch discs to watch the concert in its entirety, overall, Genesis' \\"The Way We Walk\\" DVD is wonderful and I absolutely adore it; it focuses mainly on the band's music from the '80s and '90s instead of the '70s (aside from \\"Old Medley\\").<BR>Yet, in terms of the physical DVD case, I would've preferred two single keep cases instead of a double-disc case, plus the discs are hard to remove from the case, because of the \\"Lift Here\\" top finger slot type of design used, which I don't like because a DVD is NOT supposed to be touched on its underside (aka the playing side of a single-side disc), so grasping the discs by their edges and freeing them from the case seems impossible, but if you have a bit of patience they can be removed without being scratched or damaged. (I love the DVD cases that have the two-part jewel post, which you just push down where it says Press Here and it releases its hold on a DVD's center ring.)<BR>Video-quality wise: the concert looks fairly good, though some video compression had to be sacrificed so four hours+ worth of video could be on each disc. Both discs are dual-layer; consequently, the layer changing occurs during two songs, which pauses the songs for a second, but it's no big deal.<BR>Audio-quality wise: the concert sounds fairly good (a bit weak) in standard two-channel mode, though the audio was remastered for 5.1-channel Dolby Digital surround sound, which makes the concert sound better (fuller, clearer) when down-mixed to stereo. The third audio track demenishes the concert sound to something coming out of an alarm clock radio, replacing the audio with a running commentary of performance/the overall show from Phil Collins, Mike Rutherford, Tony Banks and Genesis' manager Tony Smith. The commentary is interesting and somewhat insightful, but since British people tend to speak quickly the comments from the four menaren't exceedingly understandable (plus it sounds as if where the guys were screening the concert to make the commentary wasn't a very good place to record their voices; also, with the commentary having been done in 201, the concert was then nine years old, so it seemed as if all four of them were trying hard to recollect their experiences of that November 1992 Earl's Court performance).<BR>Still, overall, despite the few flaws it has, this is a great DVD set--a must have for hard-core fans and casual fans such as myself (being a hard-core Elton John fan instead).<br />For those interested, here's a list of my A/V gear, which was used to evaluate the DVD set and to justify my review --<br />RCA 20\\" ColorTrax Plus television monitor (composite video I/O used)<BR>Pioneer VSX-456 A/V Dolby Pro Logic Receiver, with equal (5-channel) 100-watt output<BR>General Electrics GEDigital-1105P DVD player<BR>Jensen PowerStation JP-1500 main-channel speakers with 15\\" woofers<BR>Radio Shack brand 18-gauge speaker wire<br />Room size: small bedroom - approx. 10x15'<BR>Room acoustics: fairly \\"dead\\" (aka soft).<BR>James Terhune<BR>5/12/2003
B00003CXCS|1.0|This DVD requires access to the internet if you are attempting to view the movie on a computer with a DVD-Rom drive.

0783231032|3.0|I first heard about this movie when i went on a Belushi Binge. It seemed like it was going to be another classic Belushi Film(I.E.-Blues Brothers). The first time around it seemed boring and was difficult to watch with a non-anamorphic presentation(black bars taking up most of my 16X9 tv).But the second time around i watched it with my family and the humor mostly took its course.I personally believe it would have been much better had John(the man) Landis Directed it, and if Belushi, Akroyd, and Matheson had more screen time. Belushi's Patton Spoof could have been analyzed further through flashbacks etc. but all in all this is a must for any John Belushi Fan. The main thing that upsetted me was that they changed the cover artso now it no longer says collectors edition along the side which would have looked wonderful with my other belushi collector's Ed.s.This review may seem to jump around and off topic, but im sure those gifted with ADD will understand it. If any of you universal home video and DVD marketers read this, change the damn box back to what it was and i'll even splurge and buy a second copy cause my OCD conformity is so bad.
0486278077|3.0|While Oscar Wilde's central theme of corruption initially captures the readers attention, the character development does not help to hold the reader's attention for a long period of time.  Dorian Gray, the central character, has the potential to be a very romantic and dumbfounding character, but because Wilde does not go into great character development, he seems almost more like the painting that comes to represent him ... dimensionless.  The point of the novel is to point out how changed Dorian becomes over the years and how he goes from being the epitome of beauty to someone that is hardly recognized as the person he once was.  However, in order to feel this transformation, the reader would need to feel as if he or she knew the original Dorian Gray.  Because the beginning of the novel does not describe him enough, the full effect of Dorian's startling transformation is unable to be fully comprehended.<br />In addition, although the theme of outer beauty coupled with inner corruption is a strong one, this book seems more like one that should be read in a class and discussed in groups.  It is not a novel that is easy-reading for pleasure.  The style of writing makes it hard to breeze through the book, although on the positive the book brings about much self-contemplation and is very thought provoking.  The reader cannot put it down because the whole novel leads to the very disturbing, although somewhat predictable, ending.<br />In general, it is a book that should be read and will be enjoyed by many.  The reader can relate to the feelings felt by the main characters and the themes in the book are ones that can be witnessed in real life.  The general faults of the novel are eventually outweighed by the suspense and the intrigue as the painting of Dorian Gray, once a masterpiece, becomes more defiled with each horrible act committed by Dorian.
B000002C1V|5.0|When I first heard Final Cut I was slightly disappointed. Being at the time my most anticipated record: Floyd's new material after one of the best rock albums of all times, The Wall. At first listen it sounded just like the songs that never made it on the Wall,not only musically but the theme as well was deeply in the spirit of the Wall, and as such had Roger Waters prints all over it. And there I left it largely unheard for years.<BR>By the time the Final Cut was released, the Floyd were no more. The minimal contribution of Gilmour and Mason, and the sacking of Wright meant that it was only a matter of time before the end of the band as we all knew it was official.<BR>Yet listening to the Final Cut after few years with fresher ears, I did appreciate it a lot more, it is simply a masterpiece. I was surprised by how deep and meaningful and how touching and creative the whole song writing process was on  this album. <BR>A lot has been said about Pink Floyd's rift and break up and how egomaniac and hard Waters is (as one story has it even driving Rick Wright to tears in one incident), and lots of quotes of band members have revealed how this rift has dated way back before the Wall. Personality clashes along with musical differences have been brewing for some time and it came to a head on The Final Cut.<BR>Yet the influence of Waters over the sound of Floyd is nothing new. His contribution was instrumental in bringing the success that the Floyd will forever enjoy. If you watch the film Live At Pompeii, (an excellent experimental film with a psychedelic atmosphere, done during Meddle/ DSOM period,) you can clearly witness the creative genuis that dominated Waters words and playing. The other band memebers, as excellent as they are, proven with the Gilmour led Floyd of later years, seemed even back then to revolve around Waters shadows. He had lots of lyrics and music in him, and the controlling attitude to kind of 'impose' them under the Pink Floyd's name.<BR>Although Gilmour , especially with Division Bell, proved that the band can survive without Waters's influence,(a true masterpiece,) it lacks the darker elements that haunts Waters's soul and hence the certain power behind the music and lyrics that resulted from it in all the Floyd albums. <BR>Now back to Final Cut. The last original Floyd album should be listened to with fresh unpredjudiced ears to appreciate it fully. It might be a Waters solo project in all but name, and it might considered as the Wall 2, but it is also an album of rare talent, one that is in my opinion a perfect 'end' to a line up that was responsible for changing the music world forever,of influencing countless bands and providing music lovers with immense pleasure to this day.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|I had to go back and edit my review of Fleetwood Mac's newest album because the more I've listened to it, the more I've liked it.  I still do miss Christine McVie; there's simply a hole without her velvety voice harmonizing with Lindsey and Stevie's.  That said, this album is great.  There's the occasional dud, but that's what the skip button's for.  <br />Out of the 18 tracks, I love about 15 of them.  I have never warmed to Stevie's Illume nor Buckingham's Red Rover.  However, songs that I disliked the first time around, (Murrow, Come, Destiny Rules) have grown on me.  Buckingham's a master guitar player and producer, plain and simple.<br />The best cuts are Goodbye Baby, Say You Will, Thrown Down (reminds me a lot of Gypsy), Peacekeeper, Everybody Finds Out, and Steal Your Heart Away -- which is the best Buckingham composition I've heard in years.<br />Of course, the reliable Mick Fleetwood and John McVie make up the solid rhythm section.  Stevie's voice sounds better than it has in years, and Lindsey's at the top of his game.  Highly recommended.
0790729601|5.0|I love erasing knife. Allow to explain(express) to me.<BR>This film brings together all elements, the films of Arnie so pleasantly, activity, activity, activity and more activity have done!<BR>I, really, can not do mistake the activity sentence-pieces in this film, they are terrible. Some have said that it has in originality or profoundly lack, property, but these things (things) is not important in a film of Arnie.<BR>This cannot be best there to his(its), but the activity speaks for itself. <BR>The property if you know (want to (know), circles round Arnie to have to hold a witness safe damage, the damage which comes from a bundle of corporate government criminals. This sounds simple, and it is, but I cannot do just impression on you, as very well the activity exhausts without spoiling the surprise.<BR>Enjoy, Arnie spreads out.
B00006F2WY|5.0|The original album, released in 1970, had terrible sound. It was distorted and shrill. And a piece with so many soft passages didn't do well with the inherent surface noise of vinyl. In spite of that I completely wore out two copies of this album.<BR>Now, this remix and remaster is nothing short of miraculous. Increased clarity and airiness are immediately apparent. But what really stands out is the group sections. Richie Blackmore's guitar parts...well I'm hearing things I never heard before. Roger Glover's bass now has a beautiful fullness and roundness. In fact the clarity of each group instrument is amazing. Get the picture? If you know and love this piece like I do, it's worth every penny of the high price. To say nothing of the additional three songs preceding the concerto. Ain't technology great?
0385504209|4.0|This book is an entertaining thriller, a real page-turner. It's enjoyable, a good read if you take it as such. And since it came out, it's been wildly popular. Some of its strengths: It has one cliff-hanging scene after another. It has colorful characters, even if it lacks any deep character development. Except for a brief epilogue, all the action takes place over a 24-hour period, and most of that in the course of one sleepless night. Important scenes are on every tourist's map--notably the Louvre in Paris and Westminster Abbey in London--and some are in less well known but equally accessible tourist stops. Previous visitors will recognize the descriptions, and I'm sure the book will inspire new visitors to conduct their own investigations. (It's happened before: &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; brought the tourists to Limerick in Ireland; the Brother Caedfeld mysteries brought them to Shrewsbury in England; and so on.) There also is some interesting art history and interpretation. And the book is full of puzzles and riddles, some on the surface, some more deeply buried, some solved in the text, and some left to the reader to find and solve on his/her own.<br />But this omits the most sensational element of the book. I don't want to give too much away. But here's a hint. One of the key characters is a Sir Leigh Teabing. And along the way, the book mentions a book, &quot;Holy Blood, Holy Grail,&quot; by Michael Baigent, Henry Lincoln, and Richard Leigh. Get it?
B000060P79|3.0|I bought this CD after hearing the song I'd Do Anything on the radio. I really liked it, so I got the CD. I don't hate it, but I personally think it was a waste of 15 bucks. I'll admit, I listen to this CD once in a while. It is pretty catchy, and sort of funny. This is why: First of all, the lead singer's voice is very high-pitched and annoying, and second of all, these guys have no talent as songwriters. It seems like every song sounds the same. They're all about feeling sorry for themselves, and having a terrible life. These songs all seem meaningless and untrue. CD's from bands that I like (ahem, Good Charlotte...)have meaning, which is one of the things these songs lack. While they are catchy, Pierre's voice more than a few times can really turn you against a song. Second of all, for these guys to even think they are punk is a complete joke. The music may have a different sound than say, NSync, but they are no less poppy. All I can say is, at least these guys like some good bands. (track 13).
B00007H1Y2|5.0|I have to say that track 10 alone makes this cd worth having.  &quot;Secret Love&quot; is SUBLIME, beautiful guitar interplay in a crushing ballad.  The rest of the cd is fantastic too!  This wonderful cd is worth listening closely too and also provides great music for background listening at a party.
038572179X|5.0|Like several of the other reviews I've read on this site, I agree that the beginning of the book is somewhat difficult to get through.  The first 50-100 pages took me a while to read, due to the long descriptions, difficult vocabulary at times (at least for me!), and the lack of direction in the story.  But once it picks up, it picks up fast!  I read the last two-thirds of the book in one day - a few hours on a plane.  I was completely absorbed in it, and it definitely touched me.  It forces you to think about many different emotions and topics, and it gets you to really understand each of the main characters in a way that most books do not.  I highly recommend it.
0671015206|4.0|this book is really the eye-opener to the reality and truth about the rich. This book has analyzed every aspect of what the rich do and what they wear, drive, eat, own, etc. Who would of thought that that your next door neighbor who always wears the same jeans and drives that 3 year old domestic car is a millionaire. millionaires are those who know how to save money and buy only wht is necesary. I really enjoyed reading it and would recommend it to anyone interested in finding out the truth about the rich.
B00008AWOD|4.0|I don't know why, but Placebo has this thing with music that I don't understand. At first I wasn't to much impressed by the album, but it really began to grow in me; the more I listened the more I liked it. Then I realized that this CD is the same as the other ones, and don't misunderstand me. In every Placebo album, there are great songs and there are other songs that... well, you know what I mean. That's the thing whit this one. The good songs are really awesome (this picture, plasticine, centrefolds, bulletproof cupid, etc.), while the bad songs just make me skip them (special needs, english  summer rain, protect me from what I want).<br />Well, as a conclusion, I've gotta say that this is an excellent album, with awesome songs and not so good songs... just as every other Placebo album.<br />&quot;Make love,not war&quot;
0192815792|5.0|As many reviewers have noted, T.S. Eliot called `The Moonstone' \\"the first and greatest English detective novel.\\"  Is the novel worthy of such praise?  We shall see...  <br />The story begins with a brief prologue describing how the famous yellow diamond was captured during a military campaign in India by a British officer in 1799.  The action moves quickly to 1848 England, where, according to the British officer's will, the diamond has been given to one of the soldier's young relatives, Rachel Verinder.  Yet only hours after the diamond arrives at the Verinder estate, it disappears.  Was it stolen by a relative?  A servant?  And who are these three Indian men who keep hanging around the estate?   <br />`The Moonstone' is told from the point of view of several characters.  The first portion of the tale is told by Gabriel Betteredge, house steward of the Verinder estate, who has been working for the family practically his entire life.  Although over 200 pages, Betteredge's account holds the reader's interest as he introduces the main players and the crime itself.  The next account, by distant Verinder relative Miss Clack, is humorous and somewhat important, but far too long (nearly 100 pages) for its relevance to the story.  But after Miss Clack's account, things really take off at breakneck speed.  <br />Readers who latch onto the T.S. Eliot quote expecting a modern detective tale will be sorely disappointed.  You aren't going to see anything resembling Jeffrey Deaver, James Patterson, Sue Grafton, or even Mary Higgins Clark.  You also won't see Mickey Spillane, Dashiel Hammett, or Raymond Chandler.  Nor will you see Agatha Christie, Dorothy Sayers, or Martha Grimes.  You won't even see Arthur Conan Doyle.  But you WILL see the novel that influenced them all.  <br />You'll also see something else.  Something that modern mystery/detective writers have for the most part lost.  Characters.  Oh sure, modern writers have characters, but for the most part, the reader onlylearns enough about the character to forward the plot.  In our time, plot is King.  When `The Moonstone' was published (1868), one of the novel's attractions was its characters.  Collins has painted each of these characters so well that the reader feels that they know not only how they look, but their mannerisms, their movements, how they think, and their view of the world they live in.  That type of character development is seriously lacking today, not from all writers, but from far too many.  <br />Of course, the down side is that Colllins also took over 500 pages to develop those characters.  Is the book too long?  For most modern readers, the answer is yes.  I believe it all has to do with your expectation.  Put modern mystery/detective stories out of your head.  Then read `The Moonstone' as you would any other novel.  Get lost in the atmosphere and the characters.  Immerse yourself.  Most of all, enjoy.  Reading `The Moonstone' is like eating at a fine restaurant after months of fast food.  When it's over, you just want to sit back in your favorite chair and say, \\"It's nice to know that the finer things are still available.\\"  Yes they are.  Treat yourself to this gourmet book. <br />522 pages
0743201140|2.0|Four stars for content, and zero for product \\"features\\". The book applies an old strategy wisdom to the domain of self- and people management: focus on your strengths, and ignore your weaknesses unless they seriously get in your way. The authors argue that vast sums of time and resources are wasted on trying to correct people's weaknesses. Consider what the same resources could achieve if instead planted in the much more fertile soil of somebody's natural talents and strengths. True enough, and perhaps an eloquent reminder of this insight is worth paying the price of the book. It then goes on to describe three dozen natural talents - qualities that cannot be trained, such as empathy, analytical orientation or the ability to woo - that Gallup purports to have identified based on 2 million interviews. Each talent is described in some detail and suggestions are given on how to handle a person based on their strengths. Somewhere on the way to this section of the book you are supposed to take the Strengthsfinder test Gallup offers on the Internet, gaining access by an individual code that is printed on the inside of the printed book's jacket. The last part of the book describes how an organization can determine what talents it is looking for and how to recruit accordingly. I took the test and found the results mildly surprising. I would have guessed at a different set of strengths in myself but do not deny that the outcome makes sense. I do see the identified strengths in myself, but would not have rated them top-five. I shall take the advice obtained anyway and focus more on striving on those strengths at least for a while to see what happens. All in all I found the book to be very stimulating and well worth the time reading. It has given me some ideas on how to lead my own company into a new direction. So far so good. I will now discuss the product \\"features\\". The first one can arguably not be helped. Namely, that in order to kick off the \\"strengths revolution\\" one will need \\"psychometric\\" consulting services to determine what one has, what one needs, and how to recruit for it. \\"Psychometry\\" needs a reliable sample of individuals, ranging from a few dozens to a few hundreds... The second feature can definitely be helped. If you want others in your organization to take the test - as I did - you will need to buy each one of them the paper version of the same book. Naturally, you cannot use the same code you used and you cannot purchase additional codes from Gallup ...

0684833395|4.0|Catch-22 is the story of a bombardier named Yossarian, who is a frenzied officer in the air force who believes that thousands of people he hasn't even met are trying to kill him, which is somewhat true, but they are really trying to kill everyone. His superiors have no compassion, and like other people of great power believe that Yossarian and other officers are there to serve them. Everyone thinks Yossarian is crazy but the only thing he is crazy about is staying alive. Whatever he does he cannot seem to escape the tragedy of catch-22.  This gut-wrenching novel, which attacks the cracks in the dehumanizing military service of WW II, reminds us once again of all that we have taken for granted in our world and should not. This long novel took me awhile to finish but it was worth the effort. Every teenager should read this and find the deep meaning of catch-22.
0060278250|3.0|I was anitcipating this book for a long while, and when I spotted it in the book store I snatched it up eagerly. It took me several days to finish it, which is odd because I can usually read a book of that size in a few hours.    The reason it took me so long was because Garth Nix adopted the annoying habit of jumping between different characters too quickly. I would just be falling under the spell of the story when he would be off on another branch, and I would be left holding the book, thinking, \\"Well, this kind of sucks...\\" In another fifty pages or so, I would be able to resume reading where that particular branch left off, but by that time I would already have forgotten about it, or be uninterested in picking up where we left off.    Plus, the trilogy, starting with 'Sabriel', has slowly lowered its reading level and toned down the richness of unique details that made Nix's stories differ from others. This book is written more in a tone for the audience of his past books, The Seventh Tower series (I believe that's what they're called), which was directed at third graders. 'Sabriel' is definitely more complex, as far as the wording goes, than 'Lirael' or 'Abhorson'.    That's not to say that his books aren't enjoyable, they just don't have the same impact or resonance that they used to. His imagination is interesting, and if you have no trouble with the things I have pointed out, then you will most likely love this novel.    However, if you don't like the sound of this book, I recommend 'Shade's Children'. It's a YA book, and one of his best so far.
B00008NG5V|5.0|Its basically a chilled out cd. Great vibes very mellow. If you like drinking drinks on a beach, or going out early in the morning to catch some waves, you'll probably dig this album.
B00008J4P5|5.0|...It is the White Stripes on steroids, a record that makes that fabled transition from the next big thing to the big thing. Still there is the garage clang of De Stijl and White Blood cells, but here it's underscored by a buergoning bass so every thing is bigger, bolder and rocks like an absolute daddy. From the dazzling Queenesque \\"Theres no home for you here\\" to the seething raw force of \\"Girl, you have no faith in medicine\\", The White Stripes are as ecletic as they are inspired. Amidst the gnashing of guitars and thudding of drums Jack seems to have found a new dimension to his songwriting with the delicate cheek of \\"I want to be the boy to warm your mothers heart\\" and cohort Meg gets a chance to shine vocally with the whispy \\"Cold cold night\\". Theres even a version of Burt Bacharach's \\"I just dont know what to do with myself\\" which manages to sound downright ridiculous and inspired at the same time. Probably the best record of the last 12 months.

It's not exactly literature, but it's not exactly Mills &amp; Boon either. The art is quite sloppy in places, and for the first third it doesn't appear to be going anywhere, but if you're prepared for a hard initial slog, and then a second closer reading, you'll be amply rewarded. By no means a masterpiece.
0790729628|3.0|There's necessary information in the voice-over that's missing from the Director's Cut.  Likewise the style and extra character development in the director's cut are better.  What we need is either a completely new cut with better (more limited?) voice-over, or at least we need a DVD that allows you to play both.<br />I think everyone agrees that this movie could have been great.  What we have is just seriously interesting.  Since I saw the original release, I can't objectively judge how well the director's cut stands on its own.  I suspect that most of the people who say it's great have a similar problem that they aren't admitting to.

This is a true classic film by definition. Masterful direction, interesting photography, unselfish character portrayals and a wonderful story of friendship and greed. There are a handful of smiles in this film and it's as suspensful as any thing produced today.<br />As a few others have mentioned, it is sad that this title isn't available on DVD. But it WILL be and I look forward to adding it to my collection someday.

B00008WG3U|5.0|NOFX is my favorite band and this is another great cd from them
B0000931OG|4.0|During the height of Blur vs. Oasis Noel Gallagher famously remarked that his band was like the Rolling Stones and the Beatles, whereas Blur was akin to the Monkees. Alas, time has proved the blustery bloke almost exactly wrong. Oasis has degenerated into hapless caricature. Meanwhile, Blur's new album is proof that the band is about as close as it gets to a modern-day Beatles.<br />Like the Beatles, Blur are restless. They've never been content to merely celebrate past victories. The very essence of Blur is progression, and Think Tank is no exception. However, in this case the change is even more corporeal, in that the band lost a founding member, guitarist Graham Coxon. So the question is, what did they really lose?<br />To take the analogy a step further, which members of Blur correlate to which members of the Beatles? This is clearly a lame question, although the absence of Coxon does make one thing clear: He was the George Harrison of the band. Coxon's guitarwork was alternately raw, sophisticated and sublime, and his chops are totally missed here. However, it could have been worse. Blur still has their Lennon and McCartney, and perhaps even their Ringo.<br />In typical Blur style, Think Tank blends the heady with the visceral. The first single is the raucous \\"Crazy Beat,\\" with its towering guitar riff and evil Donald Duck vocoder. Fun stuff. Other highlights are the exotic and soulful \\"Out of Time,\\" the funky \\"Brothers and Sisters,\\" the fuzzy freak-out \\"We've Got a File on You,\\" and the weird \\"Caravan.\\" Lyrically, Damon Albarn is as life-affirming as ever, waxing spiritual in a world of fear, uncertainty and doubt. The first lyric on Think Tank is also written in big red letters inside the sleeve, \\"I ain't got nothing to be scared of.\\"<br />Part of the reason this record succeeds is that they haven't tried to replace Coxon, but rather rely on their remaining strengths like inventiveness and songcraft. It doesn't hurt that this is arguably their best produced album to date. Think Tank is a mixed bag of tricks, but the heart of the band is always beating directly below the surface, often with more passion and vitality than ever.<br />Justin Halterlein <BR>Junkmedia.org Review
B00005YW4H|4.0|Here you have it: the album that swept the competition at Grammy show in February 2003. In case you still do not know what Norah Jones is all about...<br />Hype is an interesting thing. Sometimes publicity inexplicably sits on an artist you would never think to be the one. However, it happened to Norah Jones and -- well, she largely deserves it.<br />When you play &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; (2002) without knowing anything about its successes, it would probably not occur to you how admired it is. Its sound is sober, laconic, sparse. That's the deal. A Slovak (my mother tongue) sayings goes, &quot;In Simplicity Is Beauty.&quot; You can apply it here, after a few listens, maybe one will do.<br />Being an out-of-wedlock child of a well-known Indian musician Ravi Shankar, Norah apparently got more than her fair share of his musical genes. Her music contains elements of jazz, country, folk and blues -- but in fact, &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; is a very quality pop. There is nothing groundbreaking here, production of Arif Mardin (he used to work with Barbra, Aretha and Bette, to name a few) emphasises the pleasant peacefulness. The guest players also need not be ashamed of their performances (unsung sections on the title track, for instance, are painfully beautiful) -- but it is Norah's voice, very mature, that is up in front.<br />Among the highlights are the Grammy-awarded opening song &quot;Don't Know Why&quot;, bluesy &quot;Turn Me On&quot;, beautiful melody of &quot;One Flight Down&quot; and remake of standard &quot;The Nearness Of You&quot; (although Ella Fitzgerald remains untouchable in her version).<br />&quot;Come Away With Me&quot; are 45 minutes of pleasant and quality listening. Enough? Yes, in times we live in (and given the music that surrounds us on TV and popular radio) it's more than enough.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|The thunder rumbled away through the distant mountains, we left the young man lying in the middle of the road, and the first notes of Echo and the Bunnymen's &quot;Killing Moon&quot; rung out. I was spellbound for the next 113 minutes.<br />Set in the late 80's Donnie Darko is the story of a young man's alienation through mental illness and general teenage angst. Soon after a jet engine mysteriously crashes into Donnie's bedroom he starts receiving visits from a prophetic character in a strange rabbit costume named Frank. His subsequent interactions with Frank, teachers, friends, family, and his therapist weave a completely original and absorbing tale. Donnie's interest in time travel and anxiety about Frank's apocolyptic predictions move the story forward in a completely unpredictable way. There is a great deal of humour, especially with Donnie's disdain for the local self help guru.<br />The usual high school teen-drama characters present themselves but they are fleshed out with uncommon depth in this movie, Donnie's family are likeable and very functional, his teachers have lives outside school and his girlfriend has a multi-dimensional personality with troubles of her own.<br />A hypnotic and darkly beautiful original soundtrack is complemented by one of the best selections of eighties music I have heard in recent memory. Honestly the way this music is integrated with such meaning and purpose to the film's narative you'd think it was written for it. From &quot;Killing Moon&quot; in the opening scene, tracks from bands like Tears for Fears and Joy Division complement perfectly every time. In one scene where Donnie's halucinations get a little out of hand &quot;Under the Milky Way&quot; by Australian band the Church is used so well I got a rush of blood to the head, and the final scene uses a re-working of Tears for Fears &quot;Mad World&quot; to great tragic effect.<br />Some reviewers have been upset by what they see as a confusing ending, but I found the endingdeeply moving and satisfying, as I did the movie as a whole.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Chicago is easily the best stage-to-screen adaptation since Cabaret. This is hardly surprising as both projects have a similar pedigree. Both stand as tributes to the work of Bob Fosse, the dancer, actor, choreographer and director whose unmistakable style is the very essence of this film. Fosse brought jazz to Broadway, bringing together two of the most American of art forms. He brought that same magic to movies and this film is the perfect homage to his craft.<br />Chicago tells the sordid tale of an ingénue whose dreams of stardom are shattered, it seems, when she murders a suitor who she discovers has claimed he can give her a big break when he only wants to get her into bed. The murder charge actually turns out to be her big break as her infamy catapults her into the headlines. Chicago beautifully blends theatrical and cinematic space and style in a way that few films before have achieved. It remains flawlessly faithful to the stage production while enhancing it with electric editing and pulsing pace. While many musicals have been muted and diluted by their transition into movies, under the lean vital direction of Rob Marshall, Chicago is actually invigorated by it.<br />Much of this has to do with some unexpectedly assured performances from a cast not usually known for soft-shoe shuffling. Catherine Zeta-Jones appears to have particularly brazen abilities from her little-known background as a musical comedy actress. She brings it all to bear from the first moments when she turns celluloid into sequins from her breathtaking opening number. Renee Zellweger is even more of an astonishment. Despite her wispy screen presence and skeletal frame, she has a robust talent and her moments on screen are quite magnetic. Richard Gere is equally remarkable and he carries off the role of the publicity-hunting lawyer with great relish and considerable charm.<br />While Moulin Rouge reintroduced the musical only to deconstruct it, Chicago reconstructs it from the ground up, returning to the basic building blocks of the form. Chicago gives you the ol' razzle-dazzle but with exciting new energy and direction, and few films this year will be as rousing or as dazzling.
0385504209|4.0|...clunky writing. That's a fair complaint, except that this is a \\"readerly\\" (i.e., like Grisham, but better) not \\"writerly\\" (i.e., Styron) book. Don't buy this book expecting character development and beautiful prose. This is about a fantastic plot, but I did figure out the codes before they were revealed and the 2-page chapters got on my nerves (-1 star). But it's a page turner, and makes me want to do some research on the subject matter to see how much is fictional, how much conspiracy-theory, and how much truth.
0201485672|5.0|I've known about this book for over a year. Initially, I thought it was about re-engineering legacy systems. I don't do that, so I didn't give it much thought. Over the past year, I have stumbled across repeated references to this book. Everyone seems to cite it, and now I understand why.<br />It's very easy to fall into 'analysis paralysis' when doing object design. A commonly heard complaint is \\"I have created 27 different class diagrams, and 42 separate sequence diagrams, but I can't seem to get any code written...\\" XP's popularity is due, in part, becuase it get's you into action--you begin writing code immediately, instead of creating diagrams for weeks (or months) on end. XP's motto could be \\"just do it!\\"<br />But how does one reconcile this \\"code first, ask questions later\\" mentality with an acknowledged need to at least do some design work? In \\"Refactoring\\", Martin Fowler provides the answer. His prescription is to create some code to get something working, then look at the code to see how it might be improved-- refactor it.<br />In Fowler's view, you won't really understand the problem until you have coded it, so instead of spending the next three weeks trying to find the perfect pattern for your next task, forget the pattern, and get some code going. Once you've got something workable, then think about patterns you might back into from your existing code.<br />Of course, that's a gross oversimplification of the process, but it gives a flavor of the ready-fire-aim process that 'Refactoring' is built around. And it seems to work--even people who don't buy into other core practices of XP seem to have adopted refactoring as a central element in their process.<br />The catalog of refactorings that the books provides are a first class reference on how to clean up particular problems. But to me, the most valuable part of the book is its first fifty pages.<br />Fowler starts the book with a simple, but ugly, example, that he proceeds to refactor, step-by-step, into something rather elegant. If you like to learn principles first, you might want to read the second chapter before going through the example, but I found it a very valuable exercise. I recommend coding the example in your language of choice, then refactoring along with Fowler as you work through the example.<br />There is a temptation to relegate refactoring, like testing, to simply another development technique. But like testing, refactoring is at the core of a development philosophy: \\"I know I'm not going to get it right on my first pass, so I'll be satisfied with making it as right as I can. Having done that, I'll have a much better idea how to make it better, and I will. But time's a' wasting, so I need to get moving.\\"<br />This philosophy of continuous improvement allows the developer to get into action fairly quickly, and it reduces the risk of failure-by-delay. Fowler's book is a top-notch resource that will help the developer create more flexible code more quickly. I can recommend 'Refactoring'  without reservation.into something rather elegant.

It was as if all the popular bitchy girls in school had been magnified by ten thousand times to get Chris's attitude. And I'm not sure why, but I couldn't stop staring at Tommy's hair. Maybe I'm just crazy. I thought this movie was excellent...
B00003W8NM|5.0|This is a definite to any DVD collection. A rare DVD that makes you think. Norton plays Jack and Brad Pitt plays Tyler who is a soap salesman with a twisted way of viewing life. Tyler thinks the way to get the most out of life is by testing your durability in other words beating yourself till you can take no more. And if you if can endure the most painful of pains then what's there to be afraid of. Together Tyler and Jack start an organized underground Fight Club where the members Fight each other. The club has rules. It really is strictly insanity. But a twisted ending will totally expand your mind and make you think outside the square. A classic. One of the best DVDs I have ever come across.
B0000057C5|5.0|A good CD, not on par with Mutter or Live aus Berlin, but still good. Studio versions of LAB greats, though the studio takes some of the meat of their live sound. I'd give this a 4.5 stars, but it can't do fractions.

Ethan Hawke plays a newbie police officer in Hoyt, training to be a narcotics officer. He has one day to prove himself to Alonzo. Hoyt starts his day getting ready to make an impression but Alonzo is the one who is about to show Hoyt what it's all about. On his first trip with Alonzo, Hoyt doubts everything Alonzo throws at him realizing how wrong it is. But Alonzo finds a way to convince Hoyt how everything he does is for a reason and how different the streets really are. He teaches Hoyt and walks along the line of justice. But as things start to unfold Alonzo walks along that line and takes Hoyt with him. When Hoyt realizes what Alonzo is teaching him Is not justice but criminal. And as things start to get hot and heavy Hoyt realizes that what he has been through was less a test and more a set-up.   This DVD is an action-packed movie with a brilliant cast and soundtrack.
0790736039|4.0|This film had the classic undercurrent so prevalent in Stephen King movies, but maintains greatness.

B00005JKPF|5.0|I thought this movie was great (even having not seeing the first one before because of having some sort of prejudice against it)! Though it seemed to me to start out a bit corney, the rest was great. The action and little numerous love triangle side storylines as in the comic/original cartoon when I saw when I was a kid gave me great memories. I was a little disappointed though at the fact that they follow the new television show \\"Evolution\\" a bit more than the original cartoon/comic. What I'm really trying to say is that I miss the Beast, Jubilee and Gambit (especially him!)... I see there was reason to leave out Gambit for he doesnt really have much of a power with exploding cards and all but still, there might have been room. Hopefully they will be encorporated into other sequels (which I'm guessing they'll be more of). Still, it was a good movie and I highly recommend it... One reason being the hook at the end of the movie where they give you a hint of a bird flying through water... I believe that they might bring in the Phoenix as in the cartoon in the next film, hopefully my predictions are correct as I would find that very amusing! Overall, as I've mentioned many times before, this was a very enjoyable and nostalgic film; I hope you comic fans out there go see it because its well worth the nine dollars!
0679890475|1.0|This 1 star review is for the board book edition -- certainly the harcover gets 5+ stars; it is a classic that should be in every child's library. But why does Random House insist on abridging its catalog to get them to fit into board book format? The board book strips down a story that's already quite simple, and takes all the flavor and joy out of it. <br />Bottom line: if you want to enjoy \\"Are You My Mother?\\" go and buy the \\"complete\\" hardcover edition. If you need something sturdy that your child is going to teethe on, buy a Zwiekback biscuit.
0810945797|5.0|First of all, I'm fully agreed with what Katie's comments as well as her gut feeling about this reprint version. In fact, overall quality of the book is over my expectation. After studying it you should note that it's definite a great project of the producer to making the movie; many many conceptual artworks and creature design. I'm not sure whether 'The Dark Crystal' is profitable to Jim Henson and Brian Froud, but I believe both of them and the team had bring us a fantasy adventure movie that we never saw. Finally, I hope more books related to Dark Crystal could be published that it is really very demand from the Dark Crystal fans.
0385335482|5.0|True confession: Like Becky Bloomwood, I am raging shopaholic and have been one since I got my first credit card back in my freshman year of college. And like Becky, sometimes my bills are in the scary range. Unlike Becky, I haven't stuffed my credit statements into a trashcan or written creative letters to my creditors. But I would love to romp through her closets!<br />Now onto the book. Becky Bloomwood is a single Londoner who works in publishing (yes, another one of THOSE). She may officially write for a magazine on sucessful saving and money management, but she truly spends more time in the shops, at press functions and in the image warehouse with her best work buddy &quot;selecting&quot; graphics for their magazines issues.<br />While on the way to a press function, Becky gets waylaid by a sale sign at her favorite (and exclusive) accessories store. Using her wiles and a wild tale to hunky Luke Brandon, Becky gets the scarf of her dreams. Well at least the scarf she dreams of for the moment. <br />But having the perfect scarf doesn't mean her life is in balance. Her bank manager wants to meet with her about her overdraft and her creditors are howling at the door. Her terrific flatmate offers to help but Becky can't bring herself to take advantage of the situation. Instead Becky decides to &quot;cut back&quot; and spend less with disasterous results.<br />Will Becky ever pull herself out of debt? Maybe. Will she find a boyfriend? Perhaps. Will she manage to come out on top at the end of the day? Yes.<br />For anyone who loves Marian Keyes or Wendy Holden, Sophie Kinsella is a must have.
B000002LCE|5.0|Dream Evil is one of the best Dio albums - his songwriting is arguably at its peak on this record. Several of the songs, including \\"Night People\\", \\"Overlove\\", and the title track \\"Dream Evil\\", are among Dio's best ever. The best song by far, however, is \\"All the Fools Sailed Away\\". This song is amazing! The synths in the chorus are so powerful, it is such a good hook. I would buy this album just for that one song.<br />There are a couple things that could be better, though: one is the obvious absence of Vivian Campbell. Although the great Dio guitarist is not on the record, his replacement, Craig Goldie, is not half-bad. He actually tears it up pretty well. And the other two original members, Jimmy Bain and the awesome Vinny Appice, are still here of course! The other thing that is not too hot about the album is the production. Unlike the clean, sharp production of his earlier albums like Holy Diver and Last In Line, this one tries to go for a \\"heavier\\" type sound. Unfortunately, it is more muddled, and the bass at times is almost completely lost. Also, his voice sounds strange and distorted; that is one of the first things I noticed when I got it.<br />But, all in all, Dream Evil is a very strong record, with some amazing material. Even the filler is saved by a good hook here and there, and ALWAYS a great guitar solo!
B00008J4P5|5.0|It was a given that Elephant would be an awesome album, but I think it's one of their best, if not, the greatest yet. Their sound is so incredibly kick ..., and it's all coming from two people! Meg and Jack White are the epitome of great rock in today's society. And what makes this album even greater is the fact that Meg finally gets to sing a solo, which, may I add, shows off her beautiful vocals. This album is delightful and great to listen to no matter how you're feeling.
B00005JLRT|5.0|Ever since Star Trek VI, the series has been losing momentum.  After the TV show TNG ended, Star Trek has been a monotonous and ridiculous franchise that is desperately trying to hang on.  The culmination of this is the ninth film, Star Trek Insurrection which was so bland and uninteresting I can't believe they didn't send it straight to video!  But wait, here comes director Stuart Baird, who has single-handedly breathed life into a dying series.<br />Star Trek Nemesis has everything you could want in a sci-fi film.  A cool-looking dune-buggy chase scene, an evil and interesting antagonist, awesome special effects, real characters and one of the best plots in the Star Trek series.  The look of the film is dark...just dark enough for the plot.  The cinematography...especially in the desert scene...is different from anything Star Trek has seen, but it's exactly what it needed.  The only thing that's out-of-place is where Data's clone came from, which ignores the possibility of Lore's return, but the rest of the film makes up for that (after all, they ignored the storyline of the Borg being individuals when they made First Contact).  <br />All in all, this film is great!  For every sci-fi fan!
B0000033TE|5.0|This is a classic of progressive rock. Nuff said. Greg Lake was recruited from King Crimson way back in 1969 by Keith Emerson. At the time, Pete Sinfield the legendary progressive rock lyricist was a member of KC. When Lake left KC (which would break up at the same time to reform later) he would write his own lyrics, while Sinfield continued to write for KC and various other progressive rock bands. He would eventually leave KC after \\"Islands\\" and strike out on his own. <br />Meanwhile ELP were putting out the leading-edge progressive music and produced 4 spectacular efforts, all penned by Lake/Emerson and some Palmer, with help from Mussorsgky (sic) Bartok, Handel, Stravinsky, and Ginastera! The time was ripe for their masterpiece. <br />1973 was ELP's year. With the release of BSS with it's enigmatic cover and futuristic music they were the top of the progressive world. For this album, Pete Sinfield returns to work with Greg Lake, writing all the words for Karn Evil 9, their still unsurpassed masterpiece. The story is a history (or something)about man's struggle for glory and finally confronting the great man-made computer, which questions man's self-importance.<br />The playing on this album is superb, especially Emerson, who really makes his mark here. Stylistically the album ranges all over, making for a varied and never a dull moment listening.<br />I read one review here, where they complained about the production. I always thought Greg Lake's production sounded pretty good, a very adventurous and original mix for 1973.<br />BSS was followed up by an impressive live triple-LP. After that all was quiet for a little while, as they were on top and on tour.<br />Later, a single with the title Brain Salad Surgery was released, followed by the disappointing \\"Works\\" Vols 1 and 2. They would never reach the same height as BSS.

0385504209|3.0|Despite the promise of delving into secret societies and code-breaking, I felt the book was shallow and predictable.  It provides decent insight into the many interpretations of DaVinci's work, however, I was skeptical of the research used to arrive at the conclusions in the book. If you are a Catholic, the book is sacreligious, however it is not threatening.  It was a good book to pass the time on a long transcontinental flight, however not meaty enough for me.  I give it a B-/C+ .  The character of Robert Langdon was merely a vehicle to move the story along. There was very little character development, and left me wondering about the motivation of the characters.

B0000639F4|2.0|Unfortunately, the filmmakers failed to follow a few cardinal rules: #1- Don't move the camera incessantly unless absolutely necessary. #2- Don't zoom in and out on a subject. #3- Audio is what often keeps people watching a film; therefore, audio quality is very very important.<br />I love the CD, I am a big fan of the music and even play it, yet the over-use of the StediCam (a camera mounting device that allows for smooth, steady camera operation of a hand-held camera) is at times dizzying.<br />Lastly, at times they pay little attention to the music.  Some of the scenes (such as the piano player with the ballet class) are contrived.  One can only imagine what it was like to be interviewed as the camera person circled you endlessly.<br />I am so disappointed by this DVD that all I can say is buy the CD and forget this film was ever made.  The only reason I don't give it a &quot;1&quot; is because that's unfair.  My criticisms are stylistic; however, they do render the film difficult to near impossible to watch.
B00006LJ79|3.0|I was anxious to hear t.A.T.u.'s CD, having heard much about it for quite awhile now.  As of this writing, I am just completing my first listening.<br />I'm not fond of the insert with lyrics, as the type is small, and there are lyrics missing for parts of several songs.  Two songs are also inverted on the lyric sheet, one appearing on the page before the song it is actually after.<br />The songs themselves -- I don't need to say much about \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\" and \\"All the Things She Said,\\" these being what's made t.A.T.u. popular in North America, and the songs are getting much radio play.  Whether they are good or not is in the mind of the listener.  Nonetheless, they must admit, the songs are infectuous.  I can't get them out of my head. <br />\\"Show Me Love\\" features a Russian telephone conversation and is beat-based, but still is able to highlight the talent of both Lena and Julia in the verses.  I have to admit, I like the lyrics for this one.    <br />\\"30 Minutes\\" -- I like the sound of this song.  While all the lyrics on the album are overly simple, they are still emotionally strong.  Something in this song, musically, tugs at me.  It's mainly piano and voice, but is very haunting.<br />\\"How Soon is Now\\" cover -- Imagine this, it took two Russian-speaking girls and a set of lyrics for me to finally understand the words in this song...  I've heard a lot of criticism on the fact that t.A.T.u. did a cover of this song, but I think they carried it out pretty well.<br />I'm not especially fond of the last three individual songs on the album, though -- \\"Clowns (Can You See Me Now?),\\" \\"Malchik Gay,\\" and \\"Stars.\\"  While I like the musical sound of \\"Clowns,\\" the idea of \\"clowns all around\\" just gives me the creeps.  I don't care for \\"Malchik Gay\\" (although I can relate to having a crush on a gay male...) nor \\"Stars,\\" which alternates between English voice and Russian \\"rap\\" with Egyptian-sounding influence.    <br />The last four songs on the album are composed of two Russian versions, one of \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\" and the other, \\"All the Things She Said.\\"  It's nice to hear the songs sung in the girls' native language, much more tongue-twisting and complex than the simplistic English lyrics.  Follows is an extended version of \\"Show Me Love,\\" which I enjoy in both versions.  The remix of \\"30 Minutes\\" is the last on the album, and while the album version is nice, the remix sort of drags on.  <br />(A note on what CD I am reviewing -- while it is 200km/h in the Wrong Lane, it appears to be a different version of the CD than is popularly available right now.  It features t.A.T.u. in front of a white background on the front of the CD.  They are wearing their schoolgirl uniforms, Julia (dark-hair) facing backward to the camera, appearing to be kissing Lena (the red-head).  It is the 2002 Universal release of the CD, possibly an earlier North American release, as it was the CD cover I was familiar with when I first heard of t.A.T.u. a year and a half or so ago.)
B00008DDXC|3.0|In short, this movie was made solely by special effects and the plot. The only good actor, and many aren't even decent, was Kenneth Branagh, who played Gilderoy Lockhart in the Chamber of Secrets. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) and his friends show little to no emotion during the movie, and even the more experienced actors portraying the teachers do little to show their talent.<BR>     This movie, even though I thoroughly bash it above, was a huge improvement from the first, and I am anticipating the next installment. Once the main characters learn how to act, then these movies should have enourmous potential. The special effects are wonderful, I didn't think they would pull that off, and the plot provided by J.K. Rowling's books are superb. In particular, I am waiting for the announcement of the beginning of the production of Goblet of Fire, for I think that should be a very interesting movie to watch.<BR>     In conclusion, all those who liked the first movie should go out and see Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. For those who would've liked Sorcerer's Stone had some aspects improved, they should go see Chamber of Secrets because those things have probably been improved. And finally, for all those who disliked or hated the first movie, do NOT go see the second in the ongoing series.<br />              **I hope you found this review helpful**
0684833395|5.0|Catch 22 is a book about a great American bomb squadron during World War II.  The book is about what it is like to be an American pilot in another country during the war.  Yossarian, who is the main character of the book, is basically a very crazy person just because of all the experiences he has had with war.  He has seen so many of his friend die that he does not want to fly on any other missions because he thinks that he will die.  He is very nervous as to what will happen in the future, so he basically goes into the hospital so he does not have to go on any other missions.  One of the main problems is that the number of required missions keeps getting raised, which means for him that he will be stuck there until he gets them done, but he does not want to go on another mission and refuses.  <BR> During the book, Yossarian comes up with many plans to help him get out of the war and to get back home.  All of the plans that he makes up, always get destroyed because of catch 22.  Catch 22 is a kind of statement or rule that the men in the war have come up with for certain circumstances they are put under.  Every time he tries to get out of the war, there is always someone or something that is stopping him, and that is the catch.  Eventually toward the end of the book, some of the higher ranked men ask him to fly the less dangerous missions, and they will have other men fly the dangerous ones in his place.  He still disagrees with this because he does not want the men to be put in a spot where they see the same that he has seen.  This is Yossarians main problem in the book.  He wants to save all of the men in the war from dying or from seeing the horrible sights of the war that he has seen.  This would mean that in order for Yossarian to save the men is for him to fly the dangerous missions.  Every time he flies the missions, he is getting more insane because he is putting himself in the places that the other men would die in.  This for him is self sacrifice, and thatis what is making him so insane throughout the book.<BR> During the book, Joseph Heller, the author, does a great job in explaining the circumstances and events that happen in war.  He does a very great job in describing all of the characters and how they all feel.  He also relates all of the feelings of the characters, to the real life feelings that people would have while in war.  The main theme of the story is that Yossarian has to sacrifice himself in order to save the other men in the war.  This is the problem, because it makes him more insane throughout the book, but in order for him to save the men, he is forced to choose one of the two things that are put in front of him, and that is the catch.  Throughout the book overall, Yossarian has himself caught between two things that are both bad for him.  So overall, the theme of this book gives a good idea as to what can happen to a man that is put in the horrible consequences of war.  I think that the overall book is very well written, because the author can make the reader feel sad about the war one minute, and happy about it the next, and that is what is so great about the book.
B00005JLRT|5.0|There are some (more like many) who have writen reviews for this movie ripping it to shreds and putting it down at every turn. These people obviously have no intelligence about them or they were watching the wrong movie!<br />This film is probably my favorite Star Trek movie of all.  I, myself, am a die-hard ST:TNG (Star Trek: The Next Generation) fan and I believe this movie was a fitting end to a trully moving show.  Next Gen ran seven full seasons, but wasn't done there.  They went on to participate in many Star Trek films (Generations, First Contact, Nemesis...etc.).  This movie marked the end of the Next Gen journey.<br />With all the horrible things being thrown around right now such as the new TV show Enterprise (which, by the way contradicts almost every aspect of Star Trek, never mind the ship and crew never existed) it is good to have a wonderfull film such as this one come out and give Trekies a good show.<br /><<<If you haven't seen the movie skip this paragraph!>>><BR>To those who object to the loss of a certain crew member and only mention it to ruin the movie for readers, let me comment that you have totally missed the whole message of the action that the character's voyage towards humanity has finally reached its mark.  And if you are stupid enough to think he's dead you obviously didn't understand the importance of the last 2 minutes of the movie and the fact that B-4 is singigng the same song Data sang  at the beginning of the movie!<br />I say again, this is probably the BEST Star Trek movie ever made and it will live on as the best for a long time.  But to understand the movie and its powerfull message you must open up and see every aspect of it instead of closing yourself off the the actions.  This movie is full of intense drama as well as GREAT action and is a must-buy for any sci-fi fan!
0060977493|4.0|I read this book prior to it being nominated for and then winning the prestigious Booker prize.<br />It is without doubt an excellent book, the language being particularly beautiful and flowing. In fact it is a near miraculous achievement for a first time author. However, though you should definitely read this book because otherwise you will wonder what you missed, I would strongly advise you also read Salman Rushdie and other Indian subcontinental authors and make your own comparisons.<br />For me Roy's book follows closely in it's style (using disjointed stories that find a common theme and direction), it's settings and even it's characters to Rushdie's writing. In all these categories I find Rushdie's work to be more accomplished with more depth. This is not a complaint, merely an observation. If there is one dissapointment it is that in Roy's book, twists designed to shock, or atleast stir emotions, seem obvious so early on that you do not get surprised when the moment comes - and simply find yourself enjoying the eloquent use of words instead. Roy's book is far less intricate than Rushdie's work and so also easier to follow. You certainly needn't be put off by comments that it is too complex - it is just interestingly written.<br />This is definitely a book that is well worth reading, I even feel a little guilty giving only 4 stars (sorry Arundati), but there are other authors of Indian subcontinental origin who are perhaps worth picking up first.
0553274503|5.0|Flowers For Algernon is a very sweet story which I had trouble reading again because I knew what would happen to the main character, Charlie, at the end. I first read this when I was in 8th grade, and this was the book that my teacher assigned the class to read. For that, I'm glad. Mind you, this book doesn't have any adventure or action in it, even though some places claim that this is Sci-Fi, but its a very touching story that you can't fully appreciate unless you read it the whole way through, if you have the patience. The first part of the book is kinda hard to read because Charlie's spelling is really off, but as he progresses into an even smarter person his writing improves greatly. I thought it was really neat how the book was written like a compilation of Charlie's progress reports, it makes this feel like less of a book and more of something that really happened. There ARE some parts in this book that most would consider inappropriate for young kids, but most mature older kids(like 13 year olds) could handle this. As another person mentioned, these scenes are crucial to the story, and aren't done dis-tastefully. If you have the time and patience to read this book, I'd suggest you to pick this up or check out the library for this book. Its a really nice story.
B0000024SI|5.0|I would consider highway 61 probably bob's best album.  a lot of people would say that goes to blonde on blonde or blood on the tracks, but i think 61 just has something that separates it from the other two. of course, like a rolling stone is probably one of bob's best written and best played songs, and highway 61 and queen jane have a really great feel to them. and desolation row is just a great song to complete the album. plus, his harmonica playing has to be the best on this album than any other.  the band is also really awesome, especially on rolling stone and buick 6. well, that about covers it. anybody who reads this should go out and buy this album right now.
B000002KB8|5.0|Some people say that either Steppenwolf or Blue Cheer started the heavy metal genre but I disagree cause they don't write songs about dark and evil, it was Black Sabbath that started it all, Black Sabbath was formed by four young men who changed their name from Polka Tulk to Earth and back then they were just a blues band and finally one day guitarist Tony Iommi tells his bandmates that they should write scary music and they changed their name to BLACK SABBATH, believe it or not this album actually took only 3 days to record and it was recorded for only about 600 pounds (English money which is about $2000 in the U.S.) and their classic followup Paranoid took only 5 days to record which was Black Sabbath's masterpiece.<br />Black Sabbath<BR>Once when you pop in this CD or cassette, you're gonna be riding on a trip to darkness listening to this song and it's an all-time classic, so much a classic that if it hadn't been for Black Sabbath, half of those metal bands wouldn't be here today and we owe the heavy metal genre to Black Sabbath, also it's a rare thing that an album can be both self-titled and a title track, one of Black Sabbath's best. 10/10<br />The Wizard<BR>This is only one of two times that singer Ozzy Osbourne gets to play the harmonica with Black Sabbath (he also played harmonica on Swingin' the Chain which was a closing track for Never Say Die, Ozzy's last studio album with Black Sabbath) and this is one of Black Sabbath's most bluesiest songs, not quite a classic but it's a very good song. 8/10<br />Behind the Wall of Sleep/Wasp/N.I.B.<BR>What you got is 3 songs melded into 1 and each of them are killer classics, especially N.I.B., N.I.B. was so good that Primus covered the song with Ozzy as the guest vocalist, this CD is worth it for this song alone, and too bad Sabbath would never be the same after Sabotage. 10/10<br />Wicked World<BR>This song kind of reminds me of the Vietnam War and the world can be a real wicked place once we get into bad situations like we were with Osama Bin Laden or Saddam Hussein and while it may not be a classic, it's another great song by the young lads out of Birmingham. 9/10<br />Bassically/Sleeping Village/A Bit of Finger/Warning<BR>This is Black Sabbath's longest song of all time clocking in at over 14 minutes, while some parts of the song get a bit slow, the killer parts are worth the wait, and believe it or not, Warning actually wasn't composed by Black Sabbath, it was actually a remake like Evil Woman (not E.L.O.'s version) which was done by Crow who scored a hit with the song and Evil Woman is only available on the U.K. version unfortunately. 9.5/10<br />If you're a casual or a hardcore Black Sabbath fan, then their debut album is a perfect place to your music collection, while it isn't quite a masterpiece as Paranoid, it's pretty damn close and your Black Sabbath collection isn't complete without this album, also recommended are Master of Reality, Volume 4 and Sabotage, and smile everytime that you look into your Sabbath collection.
0316666343|1.0|This is a story that indulges a taste for the horrific details of a loathsome crime, the capture, rape, murder and dismemberment of a young girl.  The storyline is, on the surface, awful indeed, but the hype surrounding the book led me to believe that the novel rose above that to deliver some uplifting message.  Acquaintances who had read the book said it was pretty good.<br />Why?<br />Can people be so insecure about their own mortality that they are willing to grasp at straws such as these for reassurance?<br />This story just made me feel bad.  If I could give it less than one star, I would.
B00008J2DQ|4.0|Fisrt of let me say this album rocks...yes some of the riff's sound a like..but so didnt Metallica back in the day.Music has to GROW on you sometimes and this will.One thing i can't figure is people complain when a band CHANGE's..and now they complain about Godsmack because they DON'T CHANGE.So where does it end?Best songs here..I Stand Alone..Faceless..Releasing the Demon's..and Change's....Serenity.Even the lesser songs are good as well...nothing weak here.
B000092Q4U|4.0|I just bought this CD over the weekend, and I must say it's a darn good album. It may not be album of the year, but it's got enough hooks and testosterone. Musically they kind of remind me of At The Gates. They have similar writing style riff wise. As far as the vocals go, if this guy didn't get a hernia while recording, then he's one lucky fella. There is plenty of intensity and violence throughout the CD, it's a satisfying listen for those of you into Thrash, Speed and Death Metal. In my opinion it's really a mixture of all three. It's also a nice break from all the death metal bands who think that blast beats = brutality. Lamb of God realize that this isn't so, so I applaud them for that. All in all, it's a solid release. While not on my top ten of the year, I still find it a good listen. L8r
B000003TA4|2.0|I find it strange that all the \\"hardcore\\" Nirvana fans out there say they love all their songs except for \\"Teen Spirit\\", which according to these fans, {stinks}.  \\"Teen Spirit\\" is the song that got everyone into Nirvana in the first place (admit it!), so don't knock it.  And yes, it IS one of Kurt's best songs ever, no matter how much you deny it.  I think he really did like the song, but just said he didn't when it became popular.  Besides, 1/4 of the songs strung together in the inlay are from SLTS, and the album title is named after it.  Too bad I can't say Nevermind as a whole lives up to the coolness of Teen Spirit; if you think it will, I'm here to say this: It will never live up to that song.  The person below who said this is the most overrated album ever is right; I can't think of a more overrated one.
B00008J2DQ|4.0|I can't understand why some people say that Godsmack had change a lot in this album. I think they're still doing the same, in fact, some songs in this album are very similar to some of the most aclaimed songs of Godsmack ('Re-Align' beginning is REALLY similar to 'Awake', for example).<br />If you like Godsmack you'll not be dissapointed with this album, because it's plenty of good songs. I can't see those changes that some people are tellin' here. The same deep sound, awesome riffs, powerful vocals from Sully and all those things that make Godsmack a different band. And the new drummer is good too.<br />My favourite songs are 'Changes', 'I stand alone', 'Re-Align' (check out the great guitar solo in this song), 'I ..... hate you', 'Releasing the demons' and 'Dead and broken'.
B000002UAX|4.0|Just as the rest of the pop world was catching up with the advances the Beatles were making in 1966-67, the Fab Four suddenly take another turn into left field, surprising everyone by getting rootsy. So while everyone else was creating their own Sgt. Pepper knock-offs -- even the Stones' Satanic Majesty's Request album was a day late and a dollar short -- the Beatles laid down this massive compilation of tunes, spanning two discs.<BR>Not that the Beatles were really trying to create a classic; they were simply expressing the results of having so-called 'pop critics' digging out crazy meanings in everything they did. Instead of a wildly colorful cover, they opted for a plain white one; instead of a drug-induced album title, they went for the simple title of The Beatles (which fans quickly dubbed 'the White Album, a name even the band eventually picked up on); and instead of songs about newspaper taxis, eggmen, created with complex production tricks, they went for simple themes and production. <br />Plus, they were hoping that a double disc would help them fulfill their contract with EMI faster. The growing pains were getting stronger.<BR>The album's rootsy feel was mostly the outgrowth of the environment in which most of the material had been written, whilst they were on hiatus, meditating in the foothills of the Indian mountains of Maharishi's retreat camp. Armed only with acoustic guitars, they penned songs that remained stripped down when they returned to London to record.<BR>Other songs were quick rock jams which continued the vibe of being stripped down. <BR>But with so much material, and with the band now approaching a time when they each wanted to express themselves individually, the songs careen all over the musical landscape, with no real direction. Some say that's the charm of the album, but it really is hard to sit down and listen to the whole thing all the way through. And some of the material should have been left off (Wild Honey Pie, Why Don't We Do ItIn the Road). <br />Also, Lennon and McCartney were proving that they had each become so prolific that they could now mimic each other's styles: John, forever called the rocker of the band, gives us the beauty of Julia, Dear Prudence, and Good Night (sung by Ringo). Paul, known as the balladeer, rips and snarls through such rockers as Birthday, Why Don't We Do It In the Road, and the amazing Helter Skelter.<BR>George Harrison comes into his own here with four offerings, with While My Guitar Gently Weeps and Savoy Truffle being the best. Piggies is fun as well. <BR>Even Ringo gets in on the game and crafts a country/rocker called Don't Pass Me By, which is actually pretty good.<BR>So all in all, this is indeed a classic, although the roadmap down this particular road will send you into every corner of the band's souls. A trip worth taking though.
0385504209|5.0|I'm not exaggerating here when I say that this was one of the most intelligent and intricately-woven suspense novel that I've read...well, ever, I guess! This new twist on the age-old search for the &quot;Holy Grail&quot; presented an extremely interesting historical analysis of the basic tenets of a religion vs.the political manipulation of religious ideals.  Dan Brown sucessfully analyzes the institution of the Catholic Church while showing complete respect for the basic tenets of Christianity. Very effective!<br />Dan Brown did a fantastic job incorporating history into modern-day suspense.  Not only did I learn about the truth behind pagan religions (\\"the sacred feminine\\" and the goddess)and how politics influenced the growth of the Church, but I also gained a new appreciation of Leonardo Da Vinci and other such &quot;Renaissance Men&quot;.  ...and the author's enticing descriptions of the sites of Paris (especially the Louvre) and London has reawakened a desire to travel to Europe someday!  I look forward to reading more of Mr. Brown's writing!
0375414053|5.0|I Don't Know How She Does It is a good book to sit down and read.  The book is about a working woman who is trying to manage a household and a job.  I like the way the book starts.  It starts with Kate Reddy coming home from a hard working business trip.  Kate tries to make pies for her daughter's class.  It was nice to read a book about someone who thinks that they can do a lot with in 24 hours.  If you are a working mother and are trying to manage a household and a job, this book would be good to go pick up and read.  I give this book five stars because it gives you a lot of examples of how to manage a household while working full time.
0688163173|4.0|As you can always expect with Dennis Lehane, this story has three dimensional characters and a great setting -- eerie and mysterious.  However, you don't have to have experience as a WWII decoder to figure out who the mystery man really is - well before the ending.  I'd say by page 200 you should have a pretty good idea of what's going on.  Other than that, a good read during a hurricane.

B00004RHZU|4.0|\\"Can't Take Me Home\\" is a great debut from a very talented artist. Not only can Pink sing well, but she also has a knack for conveying so many of the emotions women around her age feel. This isn't a particularly deep album (much like Pink's sophomore effort \\"Mizudastood\\"), but the songs are good and are very entertaining. So many times when I first listened to this CD I thought, \\"Did she really just say that?\\" Pink really lets it all go and doesn't try to hold back with these tracks.<br />I've heard recently that Pink was upset with this album because she felt that this wasn't really her and that she was giving in to the powers-that-be back when teen pop was huge. To me, this CD stood out from all of the Britneys, Christinas, and Jessicas out there. This CD dealt with things that went beyond having a crush and thinking you're in love at a young age. I have to give props to Pink for her ability to write songs that actually apply to life and not just what happens to be trendy at the moment.<br />Stand-out tracks:<br />You Make Me Sick<br />Let Me Let You Know<br />Love is Such a Crazy Thing<br />Can't Take Me Home<br />Stop Falling<br />This is one CD you'll want to own! Pink is a refreshing addition to the music industry and I can't wait to see what she comes up with next!
B000002BQK|3.0|I think the upbeat tracks(honey,the roof,breakdown,babydoll, and butterfly reprise) are the only good ones. Her ballads are boring and monotonous, as she no longer has the voice to pull them off.I think her lyrics are pretty weak too, she used to write better lyrics on her previous works.But it's still alright, but definately not her best.If you want to get the best Mariah there is, get Musicbox, or Rainbow.Those releases are much better, and flaunt her vocals a lot better.
B00005N83M|3.0|Although I'm not really a fan of Jennifer Lopez's music, I must say that I did like this CD. &quot;J.Lo&quot; is filled with good dance songs that immediately want to make you get up and dance! This CD also has the remix of &quot;I'm Real&quot; featuring JaRule, which was one of the most popular songs in 2001. If you're a fan of Jennifer Lopez, or you're just a fan of good dance music, buy this CD!
B000069AUI|5.0|At first i was a little skeptical of coldplay. My friend asked me to listen to 'trouble' i was still iffy, but then i heard 'clocks' and i was hooked. This is a great cd. A def for any coldplay fan or even beginner. 'in my place' is another great song. GO BUY IT def worth the money
B00005RFAI|4.0|When I first heard Pink's second CD, \\"Missundaztood\\" I was a little taken aback. I was used to the R&B sound from her previous CD, \\"Can't Take Me Home,\\" so this was definitely different. However, the more I listened to it, the more I appreciated it and respected Pink. I have to give much respect to Pink for really going out there and making music that is important to her and not doing what an executive thinks will sell.<br />Many of the songs have so much emotion behind them that you have to wonder how Pink even got through recording this project, let alone perform it over and over again. \\"Family Portrait\\" and \\"My Vietnam,\\" to me, are two songs that really made an impression on me. In \\"Family Portrait\\" Pink sings about the loss and hurt she felt when her parents divorced, and in \\"My Vietnam,\\" she once again speaks of her homelife and how she coped with her parents and life in general.<br />Stand-out tracks:<br />Family Portrait<br />Dear Diary<br />My Vietnam<br />I would highly suggest any fan of Pink's to buy this album even if you're used to the type of music she did on her first album. It may be a little shocking at first, but in time you'll really grow to appreciate the musicianship!
0684833395|3.0|If you are looking for a book to sit down and read on a Sunday afternoon, &quot;Catch 22&quot; is not the book for you, however if you are looking for a book that will make you think, and is accompanied by off beat humor then &quot;Catch 22&quot; is the book for you. <BR>    The humor in &quot;Catch 22&quot; is not your typical slap stick humor. It is, however, a way to understand the crazy timeline in which the book is written, and a way to realize how crazy the characters really are. The book's humor shows the insanity of war. The humor in this book takes away from the reality of war. The book seldom mentions fighting, it is more focused on the characters getting out of the war, and the crazy action of the characters. Without humor this book would be extremely dry, and confusing. The humor however does not appeal to all readers. <BR>    Yossarian, as well as the other main characters in this book, are all stuck in a &quot;Catch 22.&quot; Each way they turn, there is another obstacle preventing them from getting out of the World War II. Whether it be the rise of the missions required, or the increasing bureaucracy among high-ranking officials. There are examples of \\"Catch 22\\" such as this throughout the book.<BR>The humor shows how truly crazy the characters are. One character, for instance, puts crab apples in his cheeks because he likes the way they feel inside his mouth. Can you image seeing one of our troops walking around with crab apples inside his mouth, and how comfortable with our army would you be?<BR>   If you are looking for a book to really stretch you mind, as well as make your stomach hurt from laughter then &quot;Catch 22&quot; is the book for you.
B00006RCSU|4.0|I first saw this film when I was a Junior in high school. I had never been interested in Shakespeare before, but after seeing this movie, I became a Shakespeare addict. I have thank Baz Luhrman for his innovative way of using camera techniques, objects, and actors to update this tragedy.<br />Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes did great jobs of playing the star-crossed lovers who ultimately lose their lives for love.<br />I love this updated version because it allows you to better understand the sometimes difficult language that Shakespeare used in his plays. While the look of the film is very updated, the language is still the same.<br />I would highly recommend this film to people who are unsure about Shakespeare because they think it's too hard to understand. After watching this film you'll understand the story better than you ever had before and may even become a huge Shakespeare fan while you're at it!
B00005BJ9W|5.0|This album scores five stars solely on the merit of one song only:  &quot;The Chauffer.&quot;  This song is a classic and probably the best song to come out of the 80's.  It's electro-pop feel was way ahead of its time (see Madonna's wanna-be boring electro-beats circa late 90's).  Nothing compares to DD!!
B00009ATIX|2.0|I didn't expect great things from the Soderbergh remake of Solaris. Being an avid Andrei Tarkovsky fan, I was always of the firm belief that no remake could surpass the intensity and beauty of the original film, even with the much-lauded Steven Soderbergh / James Cameron(producer) partnership at the helm.<br />Psychologist Chris Kelvin is sent to a space station orbiting the planet Solaris, in order to investigate the strange happenings onboard. Upon arrival, he finds one of the crew dead from suicide, another isolated and unwelcoming, and the third appearing rather insane. Later, Kelvin realises that the planet is in fact sentient, being able to probe into its inhabitants' minds and recreate, in physical form, one's memories of people long lost to them. Soon he finds himself in the presence of his dead wife, who remembers events in their life together, but doesn't recall ever actually having those experiences. She is only part of the person she used to be, a manifested memory.<br />The film begins well enough but quickly descends into conceptual chaos. Where the original focused on the bounds of science and humanity, the remake is a simple-minded, if perplexing, love story. Where the original was thought provoking, heavy with desperate love and questions of conscience, the remake pretends to be all these things and then fails miserably with the ending, where everything is said instead of shown and stupid, redundant `twists' abound. It seems as though Soderbergh has been taking advice from Steven Spielberg who, as we all know, defines that a movie's not finished unless you tack on an extra half hour to ensure your sunshine and your puppies and your mandatory happily-ever-after.<br />Of course, the film is not completely without its merits. The directing is top-notch. The editing is pretty good in places. The score is great. The CG shots of Solaris are gorgeous. But that's all stuff on the surface. It's beauty without soul, the form of the original film with none ofits substance. Tarkovsky would be rolling in his grave.<br />If you're after an intense action/romance blockbuster, wait for The Matrix sequels.<br />If you want a recent film with real substance, get The Hours instead.<br />If you are one of those annoying cinema-goers who always express your non sequitur views loudly at the expense of everybody else's abject exasperation, need to have a `deep' analysis of everything regardless of whether there really is any need, and like it when a film's themes are spelt out so that you can claim the insights as your own, then... by all means, get Solaris. Oh yeah, and those who like random, gratuitous shots of George Clooney's naked butt will not go away disappointed either.
B00008S2VG|3.0|For the first time, I'm more into the production of a Madonna album than Madonna herself.  Granted, she co-produced this one, like most of her others, but it's Mirwais' touch that does the work here.  With no additional producers, the album has a beginning-to-end consistency not present on any others I recall.  There's nothing as strong and edgy as &quot;Music&quot; (the single), nor anything with the exuberance of &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; (again, the single) on this set.  These cuts even make &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; sound exciting.  But...do I like the album?  Yeah.  Am I dissapointed?  Yeah.  Would I recommend it?  Not without hesitation.  Lyrically and vocally, it's pretty lazy.  It's Mirwais' contribution, not Madonna's, that make me enjoy this set.  I'd prefer a little more Madonna in my Madonna.
B000068OCS|3.0|Hi, I've known this film for 10 years now (being 30) and it's probably my top all-time favourite. But it's rather difficult to secure a copy (let alone enjoying any theater presentation or TV broadcasting!) so I was soooo glad it came out on dvd! I bought it even before I had a player! I'm glad I did, even though my present player is Zone 2 only!<BR>However I agree that this dvd is not very good quality. The image is unprecise, the flow is jerky, and the sound (Philip Glass's score, ever so demanding on sound quality!!) is poor. Were these drawbacks already present on the vhs version? Or in the original film itself? I wonder. As for aspect ratio, I fully trust frankenberry and join in calling for a truthfull rendering of Ron Fricke's art work.<BR>When will we get a remastered, affordable (and Zone 1 + Zone 2 releases!) dvd??<BR>Yet all in all, it's still the only one available: so buy it anyway. No matter how (rather) disappointing the quality may be to the original film, if you like it you just have to have your own copy so you can watch it every week, or every night, or every hour-and-a-half in your life!!<BR>G. Reggio's and Ph. Glass's interviews are interesting too: they shed additional light on the work, without demythifying the work of art in any way. It *is* a spiritual and esthetical experience.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|Never a truer word has ever been said.  Undoubtadly the best modern day western, Unforgiven tells the story of William Munny (Clint Eastwood who also directed), a once ruthless gunslinger who, along with his old partner Ned (Morgan Freeman) and the nephew of one of his old partners (Jaimz Woolvett), are out to collect a bounty on the men who brutalized a prostitute in the town of Big Whiskey which is run by the sly, deceitful, and brutal sheriff Little Bill (Gene Hackman).  At first glance that seems to be the story of Unforgiven, but if you look closer there is something else there.  For years, Will Munny tried to deny what he was; a cold blooded theif and murderer and killer of women and children.  For years he tried to believe he was a changed man, but for all those long years there was something growing in this man, something that he couldn't outgun, his true nature.  The scene where he is laying there sickly after being beaten by Little Bill, when he tells Ned about his vision of the Angel of Death, he was seeing himself; and now he will be unleashed in Big Whiskey when he is pushed to his limit.  This is the incredible storytelling that most screen writers only wish they could come up with, and thanks to Eastwood's fantastic direction and incredible performances from him, Hackman, Freeman, and the late Richard Harris in one of his most colorful roles, make Unforgiven a true modern day classic.  It would win the Best Picture Oscar along with Best Editing, and Eastwood would earn an Oscar for Best Director while Hackman would deservingly win for Best Supporting Actor.  While this Special Edition DVD re-release may have some questionable extras (how about a commentary from Eastwood, Hackman, or even screenwriter David Peoples?), this is absolutely worth owning, even if you don't like westerns.
B000000OY9|5.0|This is far and away the best work Neil Young ever put out. Puts a sappy collection like Decade to shame.  This album reveals Neil's true love: synthesizers.  In the future, there will be no more electric guitars, no more acoustic guitars, only electronic blips and bleeps eminating in random order from implanted playback devices every citizen will be given at birth.  This album is so far ahead of its time, it will be looked back upon by future musicologists in the same light as Mozart's Requiem.
B000002KGT|5.0|When the remnants of Fleetwood Mac merged with the folk-rock duo Buckingham Nicks, the resulting 1975 eponymous album was simply a dry run for one of the best selling albums of all time, 1977's \\"Rumours.\\"  The entire group took a producers credit for the album, but clearly the driving creative force was Lindsey Buckingham, who appreciation for the vocal harmonies of the Beach Boys and Beatles was manifest in the distinctive vocal sound of the new and improved Fleetwood Mac.<br />What made it all the more amazing was that long time couple Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks had broken up and John and Christine McVie were going to divorce.  After watching what John and Yoko and Paul and Linda did to the Beatles, the idea that love lives that existed totally within the membership of a rock band could implode and the result would be that the parties involved, along with interested bystander Mick Fleetwood, would all get together and write a song about it, \\"The Chain,\\" that would allow them to exorcise their demons on stage, was truly mind boggling.<br />\\"Rumours\\" was also able to take advantage of the two year period it took to put the album together from the best of what Fleetwood Mac's three songwriters came up with during that time.  Buckingham had contributed the least in terms of quality songs on \\"Fleetwood Mac,\\" but this time he makes his mark laying out the destruction of his relationship with Nicks in \\"Go Your Own Way,\\" which does everything but name names and has not only a great chorus but one of his finest guitar solos.  \\"Second Hand News\\" sets the tone for the album and \\"Never Going Back Again\\" represents what he could do even with a stripped down song.<br />However the ladies of the band end up being the defining force on \\"Rumours.\\"  Stevie Nicks had already put her two most popular songs on the first album, \\"Landslide\\" and \\"Rhiannon,\\" but continued in the same vein with the moody \\"Gold Dust Woman.\\"  Again we had a Fleetwood Mac Song, which in retrospect clearly foreshadows Nicks's substance abuse problems, that was brazenly autobiographical.  In contrast \\"Dreams\\" is one of the most melodic offerings in her catalogue, with a nice little groove and the sort of flighty lyrics we came to expect from Welsh Witch music.<br />Christine McVie was never out in front of Fleetwood Mac, over there on the left behind her keyboards, but it is her songs that ultimately end up defining \\"Rumours\\" musically.  It is impossible not to think of \\"Don't Stop\\" today without it conjuring up pictures of Bill Clinton's 1992 election campaign, but since the song was rather directly responsible for this incarnation of Fleetwood Mac getting back together that would be a good thing on-balance.  The song is simple but delightful.  The same can be said for \\"You Make Loving Fun.\\"  \\"Oh Daddy\\" shows that she can get just as melancholy as the others, and anybody who saw Fleetwood Mac in concert during their glory days probably remembers \\"Songbird\\" as the song that would McVie would come out and play by herself at the end to mellow out the audience.<br />\\"Rumours\\" was commercial and it was slick.  But it sold all those copies because it was great music, characterized by the sort of vocal harmonies that have been appreciated by listeners of pop music from the Mamas & the Papas to the current boy/girl group du jour.  The downside was that it ended up representing Everest for the group and the next time out Fleetwood Mac knew they could not do better, so they went with bigger and the double-album \\"Tusk\\" in 1979 to try and keep the momentum going.  This proved impossible because \\"Rumours\\" was just too good.t clearly foreshadows Nicks's substance abuse problems, that was brazenly autobiographical.

6304779356|4.0|What is so great about The Lost Boys is that everyone can watch this movie, whether you like horror movies or not. It is one of the most enjoyable films I have ever experienced. The charm of The Lost Boys does not come with it being a &quot;quality motion picture,&quot; but it comes with its encore of laughter, action, and likeable characters. <br />On a scale of one to five, The Lost Boys should recieve a 2 1/2. However, since this movie is absolutely entertaining and fun, it boosts itself up to 4.
B00005MCX2|5.0|The trouble with Hawkwind is the lack of a reference point.  The closest thing I can think of  is Amon Duul II(circa: Yeti) and perhaps Pink Floyd (Ummagumma).  Another problem is getting beyond the (at times) silly science fiction themes/lyrics(much of it based around the writings of Michael Moorcock).  Once your beyond all of this what you hold here is truly a brutal sensory onslaught that is as much Black Sabbath as it is King Crimson.  The fact that Lemmmy went on to form Motorhead is proof that these guys were far beyond the musical trappings of light weight 70's progressive rock.  Most of these tracks are long and brutal and despite the sci-fi schtick amongst the best that the 70's has to offer. Do yourself a favor--get rid of all your Genesis and Yes cds and buy this and while your at it pick up Amon Duul II's &quot;Yeti&quot;.....
0743244249|3.0|Eric Parker, 28 years old and a billionaire asset manager, is on his way across Manhattan in his luxurious white stretch limo to get his hair cut. He's also betting against the yen. While he loses catastrophic amounts of money, he is visited en route by various advisers of the financial and technological scene, as well as by a physician (who confirms his nagging fears: his prostate is asymmetrical). He also makes several stops along the way, sometimes in order to rendezvous with his wife of three weeks, Elise Shifrin, the poetess (who, incidentally, keeps popping up in unexpected places), sometimes in order to have sex with various other women. His progress is halted at first by a presidential procession, later by a disastrous political demonstration, and finally by a dead rapper's funeral. As the day progresses into evening and Eric's situation becomes more and more unglued, he witnesses events on his spycam before they actually occur. Then he learns from his primary bodyguard, Torval, that there is a credible threat against his person. A famous pastry stalker nails him in the face with a pie. He takes part in a scene involving hundreds of nude people being filmed for a movie. The more he loses, the freer he feels, leading him to set himself up for his own surreal meltdown.<br />Post-modern is the word that popped into my mind as I read COSMOPOLIS, except that DeLillo doesn't quite manage to pull off post-modern. While this book wasn't as bad as I expected after reading some of the other reviews, it was still remarkably flat, toneless. A typical slice of conversation: \\"Yes. But I'm feeling a change. I'm making a change. Did you look at the menu? They have green tea ice cream. This is something you might like. People change. I know what's important now.\\" Eric is a one-dimensional guy and his mental ramblings, as succinct as they may be, don't convey much of a sense of anything. While the theme -- the chaotic and unconformed will prevail -- is highlighted in a somewhat amusing manner (by the asymmetrical prostate, nonetheless), and while several portions of the book -- the burning man, the conversation during the doctor's examination, and the entire last chapter -- were sufficiently unsettling to cause me to think twice about them, my overall impression is of a forced, uninspired tale with dead details, dreadful dialogue, and cardboard characters. But the prose, at least, was above ordinary, unaffected and remote. And the ending actually worked -- enough so that I wish I could give this book three and a half stars instead of just three.<br />Impressive, COSMOPOLIS is certainly not. But there are enough (albiet faint) flashes of brilliance in this uncomfortably sterile book that I'm going to look up DeLillo's older work, and, if you haven't already, I can suggest you do so too.hat amusing manner (by the asymmetrical prostate, nonetheless), and while several portions of the book -- the burning man, the conversation during the doctor's examination, and the entire last chapter -- were sufficiently unsettling to cause me to think twice about them, my overall impression is of a forced, uninspired tale with dead details, dreadful dialogue, and cardboard characters.

0312265859|4.0|Hard Eight is a great addition to the Stephanie Plum series. It gives you everything the other seven books have. Hillarious scenes with the classic characters of wacky Grandma Mazur, Lula, and the rest of the Plum family plus unexpected new twists that break away from the romantic plot line. New involvement with Ranger and Joe, he is still in the running.<br />This installment is about the search for a missing woman named Evelyn and daughter Annie. Evelyn's grandmother Mabel is a neighbor of the Plum family and she asked Stephanie for her help. Evelyn's ex-husband is about to get a child custody bond funded by Mabel as she put her house up for this. Mabel fears she'll lose her home if Evelyn isn't found and she fears for her great-granddaughter.  So, Stephanie, our bounty hunter and her good friend Lula start snooping around and before long they have a run in with Evelyn's landlord, Eddie Abruzzi. Abruzzi, is a nasty man who adds a much needed dark edge to this story.<br />The humor you expect in a Stephanie Plum book is still there.  Stephanie is still between Joe and Ranger.  Stephanie still is blowing up cars and the drama from her friend Lula is still a riot.  I liked this book the least out of the series but it is still well worth the read and I still found myself laughing out loud several times.  If you enjoy this series and who couldn't, this is a must read!
B00005JLRT|4.0|This film is not nearly as bad as people say. Yes, there may some small problems here and there, but let's try not to nitpick the movie like obsessed nerds. It has its problems, but it also has many high points--if only the script didn't betray them with unoriginality.<br />There is much to like about this picture, particularly in the realm of character development. There is a real sense that the crew is getting older and moving in, present in the marriage of Riker and Troi and Riker's promotion to captain--such developments add some much needed heart and soul to the franchise (though more were still needed--Picard and Crusher?). The production design and effects are top notch, and the battle scenes feature some of most inventive use of starship action in any Trek film (yes, it's true). Shinzon makes a good villain for Picard, and we even get a Guinan cameo for good measure.<br />The real problem with the film is that writer John Logan seems more content to blatantly copy \\"The Wrath of Khan\\" instead of crafting a new adventure. The Romulan angle is great, but instead of something new and different (possibly featuring Spock of Sela) we get a rehashed \\"Khan\\" complete with a personal, indistructable nemesis and the self-sacrifice of a beloved crew member. What's on screen is well done, but there's a sense that we've done it all before (a common Trek-ailment these days). And that, ultimately, is the final word on Nemsis--its an enjoyable movie, but afterward you just can't shake the sense that they missed some real opportunities here, and the movie suffers greatly as a result.<br />Still, its an enjoyable film, and to suggest its one of the worst Star Trek movies of all time is ludicrous. Trek is not dead, but it will be as long as those in charge keep trying to relive past glories.
B0000931OG|5.0|The songs on this cd are so different from one and another but come together so good. So little bands take the time to make such a fluid listening experience anymore. I know all musicians want to make more money, but the great musicians just have a different ratio from Love of music/Love of money. This Album has funk, soul, rock, but unmistakingly is rock. With blur's lead singers vocals that stretch on for miles and draw you in to it just that much more, but with versatility to make you want to move.
B000006NPY|4.0|There are rather a lot of five-star reviews here, and a few one- or two-star reviews as well. In my opinion, this album is neither a triumph or a failure.<br />Adore is NOT, as some have suggested, a more &quot;techno-influenced&quot; or &quot;electronica&quot; album. These are not repetitive, danceable, hook-laden tunes that would fare well amongst the crowds of partygoers.<br />These are, as others have suggested, simply the Pumpkins taking a more introspective, more sullen approach. The melodies, lyrics, and vocals work well. Unfortunately, what keeps this album from being a five-star album (and what causes some people to say that it is &quot;techno-influenced&quot;) are the programmed beats. This is drum-kit/synth stuff not because that's the natural course of the music in this case, but because (and this is what it sounds like) they just didn't have a human drummer.<br />I find myself listening to and enjoying Adore while at the same time imagining the same tracks with the more organic, elemental sound that a human drummer provides--and lamenting the fact that the band chose not to use session musicians for these tracks instead of programmed beats. If they had done so, this would have been a five-star album, easily. Without a human drummer, it's only a four-star album, forever imbued with that &quot;what could have been&quot; flavor... but Adore is certainly not electronica or techno, by any stretch of the imagination.

It's written with &quot;code lingo&quot; and it all sounds greek to me.  Thank goodness I didn't pay full price because this book was no help at all.  I just finished two courses in HTML and got A's in both.  I then decided to explore Javascript but this was not the book to buy.  I don't know how the reviews I read couldn't have warned us of the complexity of the book.
0393317552|5.0|Unlike many, I found Jared Diamond's theory very easy to accept. My thought while reading the book was \\"It's about time!\\". While I was somewhat prepared for his assumptions because I had recently read \\"Ecological Imperialism\\", about how Europeans exported their diseases and biota along with themselves, to my delight Mr. Diamond managed to take the theory farther. If you have an open mind, you can easily accept how humans developed through history from a biological point of view. Those who are tied to the assumption that racial grouping determined who \\"won\\", however, will have the most difficulty with this tome.<br />What really fascinated me was how we humans came to grow and eat what we do, a question that has always intrigued me. After reading Guns, Germs and Steel, I no longer have to wonder. He also answered the question of wheeled transport (Mexicans had knowledge of the wheel, but not the draft animals to pull a vehicle of any useful size).<br />I recommend this book highly to anyone who will listen. Yes, Mr. Diamond did take a risk by claiming New Guinea natives are smarter than westerners, and critics have taken him to task for doing so. I wonder though whether they do so because he has touched a nerve. I was happy to see a person of European descent who did not need to prove that Europeans are superior to those from other cultures.<br />Lastly, I would like to comment Mr. Diamond on his writing style. Obviously, explaining history biologically is a task that could prove confusing to the lay reader. No matter how you feel about his theories, you must admit that the author handled the subject so that the reader can easily understand his points. It ranks, in my eyes, as one of the best written books I have ever read. It won a Pulitzer for a reason!
B00008NRI8|3.0|Romantic comedy fluff directed by the writer of two other Sandra Bullock films: Forces of Nature &amp; Miss Cogeniality.  The problem is, 2 Weeks Notice isn't as original as either of those, but it still may be the more enjoyable of the three. Both Hugh Grant and Bullock have done these roles before and this script has definitely been done before.  Bullock plays a hard working lawyer who cares about the community and loves to protest the Wade corporation who is always tearing down some important building to put in a parking lot.  Ironically, Grant is sort of the CEO of WADE and Bullock ends up working for him and surprise...falling in love with him.  Another one of those girl falls for extremely selfish rich guy and rich guy gives it all up to prove he really loves her stories.  The love story is a little unconvincing and the plot is nothing new, but its a harmless romantic comedy that is far from the worst of the genre mostly due to some funny moments and decent performances from Bullock and Grant.  Actually, Bullock said in an interview that after this film she was going to slow down on the romantic comedy roles...good for her. Keep your eyes open for unsubtle cameo by Norah Jones.  It's like one of those music videos for a film soundtrack that intercut film clips with the artist performing only look!  There's Norah Jones right in the movie! Also Donald Trump shows up as himself at a fundraiser, maintaining his stance that no matter how rich a man is...he can still have an awful haircut.
B00008BXJG|5.0|This album is a true classic. HIGHWAY TO HELL is the last AC/DC album to feature Bon Scott on vocals before his [demise] a few months after its release. The album starts off with the classic title track that is full of energy and great riffs. After that, the album is full of energy that the listener will enjoy listening to. Standout tunes on this album are GIRLS GOT RHYTHM, WALK ALL OVER YOU, TOUCH TO MUCH, SHOT DOWN IN FLAMES, and NIGHT PROLWER which is a great blues/metal song. I'm not sure if I should use the term standouts, every song on this album is great. I havent even mentioned IF YOU WANT BLOOD, GET IT HOT, BEATING AROUND THE BUSH. This is the album most American rock fans first feel in love with this band, and I am sure that you probably have your own favorite songs or albums by the band, but I think that this is the place in time where everything clicked, the stars were aligned the right way and this album was the result. They would pay a huge cost a few months later. This album has something the will never be replaced, the voice of BON SCOTT. With his passing, I think the band lost something that they would lack from this point on. Bon was just the great front man for this band
B00005JKPF|4.0|The original \\"X-Men\\" movie (released in 2000) was a passably good film, but it was victim of infamous Hollywood machine. It had too much hype surrounding it and it didn't produce a particularly compelling story. Much like \\"Spiderman\\" from last year (2002), the original \\"X-Men\\" was a 'junkfood' cinema: it tastes good at the time, but passes through your system very fast and is, ultimately, empty. I enjoyed the2 hours I spent when I saw it, but I felt no compulsion to go see it again. \\"X-2: X-Men United\\" is a vast improvement on the original. While still somewhat bogged down with too many new characters, \\"X-2\\" benefits greatly from a more focused storyline and a deeper investigation into this histories of the manyof the characters.<br />The story, more or less, surrounds a plan by a rogue Army colonel named Stryker (straight from central name casting) seeking to use a recent terror attack by an out of controlmutant on the President of the United States, plus some additional incriminating intelligence, to further a plan to take out a personal vendetta against the mutants. Dr. Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) iscaptured byStryker with the intention of using powerful manipulative techniques to force Xavier to dohis bidding. The bidding, of course, involves the destruction of all the mutants on Earth.<br />The story has a tighterfeel than the earlier movie because Stryker isn't just some random enemy. He has shady connections fromfrom the past to a number of mutants, Dr. Xavier and Wolverine most notably. The good mutants are facedwith a double-edged sword of trying to stop Stryker without appearing like a threat to normal humans asthey are trying to gain mainstream acceptance among the populace.<br />A unique aspect of the story involves the good mutants needing to work together with Magneto and his crew of baddies to help stop Stryker (hence the title \\"...X-Men United\\". Both factions want the same goal, but for decidedly different reasons. Watching them work together, with the air of suspicion marking all their actions, makes for a more compelling story, as opposed to the standard 'good vs. evil' plot of the previous movie. Another area of fascination is the greater revelation of the origins of Wolverine and the background the relationshipbetween Magneto and Dr. Xavier. Details won't be revealed in this review other than to say that these revelations give greater depth to the film franchise.<br />All in all, \\"X-2\\" is top-notch summer entertainment. As mentioned before, there are still too many new characters. However, it seems that many of thesecharacters (some of whom were dramatically underused in \\"X-2\\") will provide the impetus for stories in future \\"X-Men\\" movies. The door is wide-open for additional films in this franchise. If they continue to be produced at this level of quality, then they will be very welcome.
B00005JM1F|5.0|Just for the record, I saw this movie five times in the theatre and nealy went into tears each time.  If you liked Will in SNL, you will love his performance in this.  The expressions that his face holds are priceless, and not to mention the infamous \\"streaking\\" scene where you see him bare it all.  The movie is a must see.
B000089RVX|5.0|I LOVE THIS ALBUM!!! These people from Little Rock, AK are making real rock. It's been a long time since I haven't heard a group with such enthusiastic and excellent balance. It's music you can actually feel. The apparently classical trained voice of Amy Lee get into you very quick and the band it's superb. It's rock with a twist.  WARNING: The song \\"Bring Me to Life\\" could be very addictive and also hazardous while driving. It's Great!!... Extremely Highly recommended.
B00008DDSC|4.0|SECRETARY was a wonderful movie. It approached S/M as an  alternate lifestyle and just as acceptable as a &quot;normal&quot;  lifestyle . This movie allowed me to feel good about my wants, desires, and needs. It also made me feel that I was not alone in my choice of lifestyle. However, I have yet to find a partner as loving, caring, and gentle as James Spader's character in the movie. Perhaps, I need to become a secretary. :) Anyhow it is a movie for S/M beginners, as well as advanced, to see. SECRETARY is a beautiful story of love, passion, and release.
0553274503|5.0|Flowers for Algernon is a great book about a mentally handicapped man, given the opportunity to be \\"smart\\". He is given a new experimental drug, previously only given to a mouse, the drug is supposed to make him smarter. The book is written in diary form, starting with his early entries when he is still mentally challenged, and then his later entries when the drugs begin to kick in. The book focuses on Charly's relationship with the mouse, that is given the experimental drug first, Algernon, hence the title of the book. <BR> The book is not for all age levels, Charly's first entries in his journal are hard to read and follow because the author Daniel Keyes is trying to make the book as real as possible, and therefore he spells many of the words wrong to show Charly's mental retardation. If you aren't a good reader I wouldn't recommend the book because it can be hard to make out some of the words. <BR>     I enjoyed every aspect of the book, the plot was intriguing and original, the characters were all unique and caring, every character was well developed, especially Charly, he never jumped from mentally challenged to genius, he progressed slowly, but convincingly. <BR>  Flowers for Algernon, is a story about love, friendship, and so much more. It will make you happy one chapter, and sad the next, it's a great book and I would read it again, even if I didn't have to. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to read a book written from a different perspective or for anyone who just wants to read a good book. I was disappointed with the ending, but you'll just have to read it yourself to find out why. I would have to agree with the New York Times, the book was \\"A tale that is convincing, suspenseful, and touching.\\"
B00008BXJ6|5.0|this remastered copy of HIGH VOLTAGE really gives us something to sink our teeth into. This album was the first American release for AC/DC and with this release, they started down their path towards the legendary status their have now acheived. The first time I was exposed to this album was when I was 8 or so hearing TNT on the radio. Even though I didnt know anything about music at that young of an age, this song just blew me away. boy was I ever so happy to find out a friend of mine had this vinyl. 20 odd years later, I am still blown away by this album, we have 9 mind boggling tracks that are required listening for any fan of hard rock. Besides TNT, in my opinion the other standout track on this album is THE JACK. It is a slow blues number that just hooks you in. With the bonus of being remastered, we also have a booklet with some never before seen pics and some killer liner notes about this album. I highly recommend this album for all you rock fans out there. Every song on this is great. There isnt a single piece of filler material here. You have the brothers YOUNG laying some killer riffs down while you have the great vocals of the legendary BON SCOTT out front. go out and get this now
0316096199|4.0|Alice Sebold wrote a very powerful memoir.  I did at times find myself skimming pages to get on wtih the story.  I found the ending to be a little disappointing though.  I think Alice fell short at the end.  It is almost as if she was tired of writing and just ended it.  I would have like to have heard a little more about how her drug habit started and more on her life up to the point of writing her memoire.  I do hope that Alice comes out with another book.  I have shared this and The Lovely Bones with friends and family.

1563898586|5.0|I used to read comic books a lot when I was younger and recently, having heard good things about graphic novels, decided to check out some of the highly rated ones. I was certainly not disappointed by this extraordinary tale with its fantastical characters and settings.<br /><br />In this story, the mysterious Mr. M has commissioned Wilhelmina Harker Murray (from Bram Stoker's Dracula) to gather a league of adventurers who will perform extraordinary tasks when the need arises.  The first part of the story is devoted to the formidable Miss Murray's finding and assembling her group: Allan Quatermain, H. Rider Haggard's hero; Captain Nemo from Jules Verne's tale; Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll (and his counterpart Mr. Edward Hyde); and Hawley Griffin, from H.G. Wells' The Invisible Man. Along the way they are assisted by Auguste Dupin, literature's first detective, and threatened by Fu Manchu. There are lots of other literary references and these are fun, but you can easily enjoy this fine graphic novel without catching them.<br /><br />Throughout the book, in editorial notes, author blurbs, etc, the conceit is maintained that this tale was written and published in the 19th century.  Also included is a heavily-illustrated prose tale, 'Allan and the Sundered Veil'.<br /><br />Caveat: If you are a parent buying for children, you might want to find something else -- there is a lot of graphic violence and coercive [explicits].
B000000WJZ|5.0|The Pumpkins' follow-up to GISH is right up there with AENIMA and OK COMPUTER as one of the top five albums of the 1990's. From the album's five-star average you can probably surmise that this is an exceptionally good record, so I won't spend any time raving. Even despite Billy's unusual (if at times annoying) vocals, the sheer power and range of this music, which remains very melodic and well-written at all times, shoves NEVERMIND, TEN, and possibly even DIRT out of the way as the best Grunge-era album.<br />The main singles from this album are \\"Today\\" and \\"Disarm.\\" While both great songs (well, at least the former), they are easily outshined by several other tracks. I'd have to say \\"Mayonnaise\\" (Track 9) is by far the best Smashing Pumpkins song ever released; if you're looking for one track to download to sample the album before buying, make sure this is it. \\"Hummer\\" is not far behind; that section between about 4:30 and 5:30 (\\"Ask yourself a question...\\") somehow sends chills down my spine every time. Other five-star tracks include \\"Cherub Rock,\\" \\"Quiet,\\" \\"Soma\\" and \\"Luna.\\"<br />All in all, this is the high point of the Pumpkins' career, as it manages to expand greatly upon GISH but avoid the tedious experimental sounds found from this point on. The five-star average ought to say something; even classic records like AENIMA cannot pull this off. The bottom line is that this, one of the best rock releases of all time, defined the alt-rock sound of the 1990's and performed it better than any of the copycats, and manages to be both accessible and deep. Don't hesitate to pick up a copy if you're a fan of any type of rock music.
7119005901|5.0|I have read many different kinds of novels. Just like Lord of the Rings, Tom Clancy's books. But I have never seen a book like this in my life. This book teaches you about the valor and courage of this warriors. My favorites are Liu Bei, Guan Yu, Zhang Fei and the greatest of all Wei Yan. But all I hate is the fact that Liu Bei didnt rule over China. Think about it. In Dynasty Warriors 4 he is the best character you can use. For all of you this book is the best. Terrific. 6 Stars.
0316666343|3.0|I have to agree that this in not the best book ever but it is a good read.  The writer could have done a better job with the story line.  Some parts of the story are filled with fluff that I scanned over to get on with the story.  The ending of the book was disappointing and could have been better.  The characters could have been developed more.  All in all I did enjoy the book though.  I'd love to see Alice Sebold rewrite some of the story.
6305907145|2.0|I was disappointed with the changes to Fanny's character and the &quot;spicing up&quot; that was done to the storyline. The changes made were purely commercial. The old BBC version is a truer adaption of Austen's novel.

B00005JKPF|5.0|Wow! I just would like to congradulate Brian Singer once more. Just seen the movie and it was beyond my expectations.( I was already expecting a great one) The first one was already a success considering how hard it is to carry the comics to the screen with so many superheros packed in one adventure and the flashbacks to the original comics books in terms of vision and character movement shots. ( Not to mention the shots where you can see half of Mageneto's face in dark and Xavier on the background with lots of Xs around in X-men 1. Such a great scene! Just like a comics page) The second one is even better, the plot, the theme, the connection made to the first one, showing the powers of each character one by one ( no exaggerations , no overacting at all!), the visual effects, actors...all were great. Can't hardly wait for x-men 3! Dvd collectors shall not miss this one!
B00005J6T0|5.0|I consider this album as Madonna's peak;catchy and freshy songs to represent the highest climax of pop music.Who hasn't listened at least once songs like &quot;Papa don't preach&quot; or &quot;La Isla bonita&quot;?To me this cd is a box of memories;Madonna with her videos made me discover U.S.A. when I was 11 and these songs keep on playing on my stereo.&quot;Live to tell&quot; is a perfect ballad,&quot;La isla bonita&quot; anticipated latin pop of a decade,&quot;True blue&quot; is a catchy and nostalgical song, &quot;Papa don't preach&quot; could be released today for its timeless rhythm,&quot;Where's the party?&quot; is a nice dance song and &quot;open your heart&quot;struck at first listening.Buy it, buy it, buy it!
B00003CXBH|5.0|I've been waiting and waiting for this absolutely brilliant film to make it to DVD already! Thank goodness it finally has, and what a treat it is!<BR>This fantastic movie in widescreen in all DVD's glory, with 5.1 surround sound to boot! It's more than fans could want.<BR>I was shocked to hear that Siskel &amp; Evert gave this film a thumbs-down rating when it premiered. It makes me seriously question not only their taste in movies, but their credibility altogether! I mean, &quot;the Mission&quot; is a fabulous movie through and through; this is one of the greatest movies of the past twenty years bar none!<BR>The score by Ennio Morricone alone is one of the greatest ever put to film. This movie also has some brilliant lines in its screenplay: &quot;Thus have we made the world&quot;, &quot;If might is right, then love has no place in the world&quot;, &quot;Do you dare try it?&quot;, etc.<BR>This film contains one of Robert Deniro's greatest performances and certainly Jeremy Iron's single greatest. The fact that this fact goes unrecognized in unforgivable! <BR>The Mission is one of, if not the most, underrated films of all time. Perhaps one day we will become sophisticated enough to recognize this masterpiece for the brilliant work that it is?
B00005JLRT|3.0|The good; outstanding visual effects provided by Digital Domain, an engrossing and well thought out story by John Logan, and the acting performances of Patrick Stuart, Brent Spiner, and Tom Hardy (Hardy's portrayal of Shinzon is brilliant!)<br />The bad; and it's a whopper... Stuart Baird should be making commercials, not feature films.  Given his poor track record (\\"Air Force One\\" and \\"U.S. Marshalls\\" are tedious films) Baird seems to have only read the script when he needed to shoot a scene, disregarding the story.  Bairds use (or lack thereof) of the marvelous sets and lighting provided by the ol' TNG group is nothing short of appalling.  One only needs to look at the scenes in the Romulan Senate and the bridge of Shinzon's flagship to understand the true lack of talant and vision provided by Baird.
B0000797IO|4.0|In dreamy reverie suggestive of &quot;Raizing Arizona,&quot; &quot;The Good Girl&quot; is anything but. In an indictment of tragic love and dreamers everywhere, this movie outlines the futility and horror of happily ever after by illustrating the lengths people will go to maintain the cages in which they live. Jennifer Aniston's perfectly portrayed character (except for the lacking accent, also reminiscent of &quot;RA&quot;) shuffles through her life forgoing crazy dreams for the necessary drudgery of her everyday existence. <br />With unflinching brutality, this movie torpedoes the smug, self-righteous stance of those who would sacrifice comfort and tedium for adventure and risk taking. One cannot help but cheer her on as she cuts a swath though any who would imperil the predictable tempo of her existence. Lies, betrayal, and denial justify the end in which the happy couple can bring another precious life into the world. <br />On a purely technical level, Aniston displays complete poise and a marked departure from the tired characters that have defined her to date. With perfect tone she projects the images of lover, dreamer, (attempted) murderer, coward, and conniver with total authenticity, ease and just a little venom. This movie also boasts a remarkable supporting cast and a breathing cinematic background. For those of you who covet the coworker/peer who seems totally despondent and dissatisfied with their lot in life, this is a cautionary tale that should not be missed.
6304708521|1.0|Let me say that I'm a Beatles' fan, owning all their offical released material and 2 bootlegs of Decca Sessions and Christmas Records.<br />But this is simply impossible...<br />\\"Hard Day's Night\\" was a fun and interesting peep into the Beatles's daily life, great script and acting.<BR>\\"Help\\" was a mediocre adventure movie, still with a nice plot and reasonable script.<BR>\\"Yellow Submarine\\" was just a cartoon.<BR>\\"Let It Be\\" was one of the greatest recording session film ever made.<br />And this must be the greatest boo-boo the Beatles' ever made. Can't comprehend until today, why...they even had the nerve to release it ?? There is no plot, script is horrible and boring, the cut into the magicians' place was simply meaningless...The only thing worth watching is the \\"I Am The Walrus\\" song clip...
B000092Q4U|5.0|As Homer would say... Anyways about the album, its been hailed as the first must have metal album of 2003. I just bought it yesterday and listened to it on the ride home. I thought maybe it would be like the rest of the stuff out there, but its really bleeping good! Track 5 is my personal favorite. I recommend it highly if youre looking for a good cd to buy. I havent listened to their first album but their second is worth having. <BR>I dont know what else to really say. Some nice guitar work, uh, singing is all growling, no melodic, but its still good. Some catchy stuff too, not like radio friendly songs but good head banging catchy stuff.<BR>Get it now!
B00003CXE7|5.0|As both a LOVER of this movie (It's probably my favorite ever) and a degreed historian, I can say Hollywood, though far from perfect, got some things right in this movie. Particularly  the Emperor's interest in gladiators. A fact rather easily verified.<br />The Emperor Commodus was obsessed with gladiators. Had a private arena in his palace. Regularly appeared in public as a gladiator. And took part in public fights with other gladiators, albeit they were essentially unarmed whereas he was not. <br />Arrogance is in the eye of the beholder, I guess.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I have a feeling many of you giving low ratings are industry people, and you need to back off of Linkin Park as a &quot;pop&quot; act. They are pure metal on this cd, tell me ONE part on this cd that even compares to nsync's sound. Exactly. There is none.<br />Like I said on Epinions.com:<br />I listened to this CD optimistic about what I was about to hear. Heavily pleased with Hybrid Theory I hoped that this CD would not suffer the commonly experienced &quot;Sophmore Slump&quot;. As the exciting but brief 37 minute CD came to a close, I was left very refreshed and satisfied, relieved that Linkin Park put those 18 months of work to good use. <br />Plus with a 30 Minute DVD &quot;The Making of Meteora&quot; that shows all that Linkin Park did in those 18 months(even the fun and goofing off), and an enhanced CD filled to the brim with bonuses, prepare to invest at least 2 hours experiencing all these bonuses. 100% Worth the money. <br />Sure this is only the tip of the iceberg on what Linkin Park could do, but if this is only the beginning I cant wait to hear what's in store next time around.<br />This takes the hardness of Hybrid Theory and builds upon it.
B00008CLOA|5.0|I can't speak for other peoples systems,but this remaster is<BR>incredible on my HTR and SACD player.I replaced my Sony HTR<BR>with a Yamaha 6.1 receiver and the sound is vastly superior.<BR>It would be nice to see Wish You Were Here and Meddle come<BR>next and eventually the entire collection.Upgrade your receivers<BR>and get a SACD player if you want to hear how sweet this disc<BR>really is.
B000089RVX|4.0|Before buying this cd, I read some reviews for this album and there were no reviews which explored individual songs on this album. So i will.<br />1) Going Under&gt; A great song. Easy to listen to, catchy verse and great chorus. Relies more on amy's voice then instrumental. 4/5<br />2) Bring Me to Life&gt; The single. Everybody loves it. 4.5/5<br />3) Everybody's Fool&gt; Not a stand out and grows old in quick time. 3/5<br />4) My Immortal&gt; This is the slowest song on the album and a stand out. The chorus is beautiful and emotive and I often find myself repeating this song. Brilliant. 5/5<br />5) Haunted&gt; A dark, eerie intro which is awesome and the title fits the song. The first verse falling into the chorus sounds so good. A great chorus. 4.5/5<br />6) Torniquet&gt; I love ben's intro and Amy's voice in the verses is very different from other songs and is so effective. The chorus is ok, but does grow old. 3.5/5<br />7) Imaginary&gt; Not the best song. A great intro with strings and the best bridge in the album. 3.5/5<br />8) Taking Over Me&gt; Another great song. Good chorus with lyrics to match. 4/5<br />9) Hello&gt; A slow song but in contrary to my Immortal this song is painfully bad. The only dissapointment in the album. 1/5<br />10)My Last breath&gt; Love this song. Particurly the guitars and the chorus. One that grows on you the more times you listen to it. 4.5/5<br />11) Whisper&gt; My favourite. Instrumental, lyrics, chorus, vocals are all 5/5. 5.5<br />Fallen is a magical debut album. Evanescence for a new band has produced a brilliant original album which gradually grows on you more and more. Tracks 2,4,10 and 11 are stand outs.
B00005JKPF|5.0|You have to understand something.  I never really collected comics as a kid.  I collected a few.  I might have 1 or 2 Hulk comics, maybe 1 Spiderman, and 5 Xmen comics.  For some reason, I liked the \\"Uncanny Xmen\\".  However, when the Xmen animated series debut on FOX I was hooked. Now this was an action cartoon ...P> Anyway, this new movie X2 is like watching those cartoons all over again.  They do this movie  justice.  I felt like I understood them again.  They were the Xmen !  The last movie, let's call it X1, was no where in comparison.  Basically, I hated that movie.  Some say that it was necessary to have the first movie the way it was, to act as an introduction movie, however I considered it waste of time and money.  This movie is the movie to see.  I was very impressed with the visuals, and with how the characters interacted. The dialogue.  Wolverines character was finally WOLVERINE !  Yes, this is the way Wolverine should be.  This is who I grew up with.<br />Go see this movie!  It will serve all those who read the comics, watched the animated series, or did neither.
B00006BTCA|1.0|Heard 'PDA' and 'NYC' and decided to grab the title after seeing good reviews all around with comparisons to groups I have come to respect. Lacking in the A&amp;R comparisons is the actual quality and substance of Joy Division or the Bunnymen. As of recent, the trend has been to bastardize the philosophy and intent of the punk and branch movements. Of the lot, the Strokes are of a select bunch to emerge from the image machine with something melodic, occasionally original, but catchy and entertaining. As for Interpol, only a few tracks are listenable -'Obstacle 1', 'PDA', and 'Stella'. Lyrically, nothing accounts for the pretentiously absurd nonsense. On the other hand, this is still better than any of the carp on radio. But hey, cool name, post-mod design, and someone seems to think this bs is decent, so you could at least pose and make snide remarks with other music illiterates.
B00005JLRT|5.0|I can't believe that anyone who even remotely likes Star Trek wouldn't like this movie.  I will admit that there were times when I though the pacing was a little off, but I went to see a Star Trek movie, not freaking Shakespeare.  This movie has one of the best space battle scenes ever, well worth the price of admission.  I just wish they would release complete classic and TNG special edition box sets ASAP.
B000084T18|2.0|I gave the album 2 stars and that is mainly on the strength of \\"21 questions\\" which let's face it, is all Nate.<br />What causes me more distress than anything poor .50 has done is all the supposed \\"experts\\" who confuse the album's genre by calling it hip hop which it is not.<br />It's a rap album, and there's a difference which you would understand if you'd been born before 1970.<br />The album should also get props for the production amusement factor: A black man (.50) being exploited and produced by a white kid (The Marshman) who was produced and exploited by a black man (The Good Doctor). I still laugh every time I see white kids clamor for M&M, talk about market penetration, Dre creates this white skinned, white haired albino to get all the suburban white kids to buy records their racist parents wouldn't allow in the house if there was a black man on the cover. \\"It's safe honey 'cause Marshall is white,\\" yeah the only black guy is the one laughing all the way to the bank ! Dre is one of the smartest marketing people alive, a chess player among children (and if you think M is so down ask yourself this, how long would whitebread last in Compton, or Hunters Point after hours ? He'd be lucky if they only took his autograph his shoes, hahaha).<br />Out of the three men responsible for this album the only one who has anything approaching talent for this type of thing is Dre and when you consider that .50 is the creation of his cracker puppet, well you get what you pay for.<br />Anyone who has managed to get shot 20 times can't be that bright if you think about it. Did you really think he'd be a good musician ? Go ask your parents what P.T. Barnham said.<br />In the future children don't confuse the uniquely East Coast artform called hip hop with it's ugly step child West Coast (C)rap (and don't say .50 isn't W.C. Dre produced him, he's bought and paid for W.C. end of story, I don't care what zip code he sold drugs in).<br />How is it different you say ? Drop a Digable CD in your boom box you got for Xmas from Grandma last year and understand the difference between music, and silly noise, in the mean time, refrain from speaking about things of which you do not understand.<br />BTW: I didn't buy \\"Get Rich\\" I borrowed from a friend, hahaha.able CD in your boom box you got for Xmas from Grandma last year and understand the difference between music, and silly noise, in the mean time, refrain from speaking about things of which you do not understand.<br />BTW: I didn't buy \\"Get Rich\\" I borrowed from a friend, hahaha.

0140544518|5.0|We all know the story of the 3 little pigs but is it the true story? In the original story the 3 little pigs were the protaganists and the wolf was the villian. But now we hear the story from the wolf's point of veiw in \\"The True Story Of The 3 Little Pigs!\\" written by Jon Scieszka.It seems The Big Bad Wolf,with a Big Bad Cold, only wanted to bake a cake for his dear old granny. When he went to his neighbors  for a cup of sugar, he sneezed their houses down and he coudn't leave good meat to spoil. So when the media saw the incident they thought it was too boring. So they spiced it up with \\"The Big Bad Wolf,\\" and he was locked away.     <br />This book is a great read for kids as well as adults. The pictures in this book are very amusing to look at and is good for bedtime stories. Parents your kids will love this book and kids your parents will love it too!
0553582445|4.0|2 a.m....  That's when I looked up and noticed what time it was.  I remember thinking that I had to be at work in the morning and had better get some sleep.  Then I kept reading...<br />Robin Hobb has again proven to be a master storyteller, catching me up in the lives and concerns of the characters.  The author weaves a mystical world of politics, intrigue and magic with enough grittiness to be believable.<br />Before you read this book, read Hobb's Assassin series.  The story picks up the lives of the main characters right where they were left at the end of the first trilogy.  I don't think much of this book will make sense if you haven't already read the first trilogy.  (You probably also ought to have read the Liveship trilogy.  It's not essential so far, but I think I see hints that Hobb intends to tie all three trilogies together.)<br />All in all, I thought this was a great book.  Fun to read and very hard to put down.  I was also please that it ended so well - enough loose ends that I can see where the trilogy is going, but not so many that I'll give up on the series before the last book is printed.  I held back from 5 stars only because a trilogy of trilogies will be a bit much.
B00005JL0I|4.0|One of the great things about DVDs is that occasionally the extras are really worth it.  In this case one of the extras is the original production of Casino Royale as it appeared on Climax Television.<br />Once upon a time it was decided to do a spoof of the James Bond films.  A four-part script was created and four directors were hired.  Ian Fleming originally claimed that he envisioned David Niven in the role of James Bond.  That became a reality in this film.<br />James Bond is needed and must be called out of retirement.  The original, that is.  The film James Bond is merely a replacement for the original played by Niven.  He quit the spy business after the death of his true love; Mata Hari (1917).<br />To redirect attention, Peter Sellers is hired as a new James Bond.  He has a system for beating Baccarat and is needed to defeat badguy Orson Wells.  But as Wells goes down, we discover the sinister plot of young Jimmy Bond (Woody Alan).  Add Mata Hari's daughter and plenty of slapstick and the result is an amazing spoof.<br />The original 1954 version of Casino Royale was produced on Climax Television and had a few unusual twists.  Although this was the first Bond \\"film\\", it is out of character with the rest as Bond is an American (What!, you say).  Bond must go against badguy Peter Lorre (who gets a place in history as the first to play a Bond villain).  The story is very close to the original novel except SMERSH has been replaced by the Syndicate.<br />A great disk with some great footage.  I especially recommend the original production that was included.

0140177396|5.0|As one of Steinbeck's most renowned stories, along with The Grapes of Wrath, this novella really does deliver what it promises in the way of true emotion and friendship during times of extreme adversity.<br />When isolation was common, George, a short yet sharp man and his pal Lennie, a large man who is slow of mind, work on a ranch in Salinas, California, during the Great Depression. With a dream in mind, they work towards their goal of living in a somewhat ascetic nature, secluded with only each other to keep company. But as the title explains, even the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry. <br />Steinbeck is probably the mascot of modern American literature, and his other works, namely Travels with Charley, Grapes of Wrath, and In Dubious Battle, entertain to the letter. He is common reading in high schools, and due to his soft and affable writing style, he is accepted nearly unanimously.
B00005JKPF|5.0|Likeable characters, a good storyline, great special effects and an ever-winning battle between good and evil, X-Men 2 has it all.  Bryan Singer does a great job of directing and sketching out the histories among the mutants and their struggles (and impending war) with humans. Some friends told me to see the first X-Men movie before even thinking about seeing X-Men 2, but I don't think it matters.  It's just one of those added value perks.  <br />This is a good family flick. It's got something for everyone. It doesn't take itself too seriously: X-Men 2 has very funny moments. Plus it has a strong returning cast: Hugh Jackman (very compelling and a hottie as Wolverine), Halle Berry, Patrick Stewart, the ever-wonderful Ian McKellen. Great new additions like Alan Cummings as Nightcrawler. <br />X-Men 2 definitely makes you want to look for your own inner mutant. A whole lot of fun from beginning to end.
B000002H6C|5.0|One one hand, you have to cut Metallica some slack; the [demise] of bass giant Cliff Burton devastated the band, and as evidenced by their 1990's releases, is still being felt today. On the other hand, this is still easily one of the top 15 to 20 metal albums ever recorded. While Ride The Lightning was their best concept album; Master Of Puppets their best for musicianship, And Justice For All is their best for songwriting, and clearly locks up James Hetfield's place as the greatest<BR> metal lyricist of all time. They alredy made me a fan(a young black kid who likes hip hop) in<BR> the early 90's with the Black album and Master Of Puppets, but this one had more of an impression on me than any other of their albums. There is not one bad song on it; great songs like Harvester Of Sorrow, To Live Is To Die, the title track and Blackened. But the absolute standout is the anti-war anthem One; after hearing this song for the first time, I immediately learned to play it on the piano and on drums; I didn't look at my turntables for months!(I actually bought a bass guitar beacuse of Master Of Puppets,but of course I couldn't learn the bass parts because THERE ARE NO BASS PARTS! Jason Newsted, where you at, homie?!)<BR>But anyway, even though I enjoy their 90's stuff to this day, this is really the end for the Metallica we all know and love. I think this album is for those people who think Taproot, Sevendust and Slipknot are metal(actually ,I like Slipknot, so I won't rip 'em too bad). Very good album; go get it!

020530902X|5.0|If you are someone who writes -- not only if you write for a living, but if you are someone who writes in general -- this book should be on your shelf, and it's lessons should be on your mind as you put pen to paper.<br />The book is not perfect: it can be dry at times, and a few of the \\"elements\\" it discusses will seem obvious to anyone who stayed awake during English class. But the book will illustrate the most basic and most important rules of grammar in a way that has given generations of writers the foundation and the tools they needed to develop their individual styles.<br />It has become a classic of English grammar, something that must seem an unlikely niche. When you see those back cover shots of authors with massive bookshelves behind them, you'll be surprised how many will include this thin volume. Even the compact and no-nonsense title has become part of the modern world's literary lexicon: look on Amazon to see how many books are called \\"The Elements of Style of\\" Something, whether it's Java script or e-mail lingo or architecture or the Unified Modeling Language.<br />I am still using the third edition to this book, which was first published nearly 25 years ago. I glanced through the new fourth edition a few days ago and noticed the glossary of obscure grammar terms added to the back. I thought about getting it, but the glossary wasn't enough to persuade me to retire my old dog-eared copy with its underlined passages and comments in the margins that date back to my high school days. If you have an older edition, it's likely you already know the value of these elements of style, and so it's your call whether it's worth upgrading to the new book with its glossary. But if you don't have this book, then that is a problem with only one solution.
1577311523|5.0|The Power of Now is an excellent book.  In reading it my impression was that it was written by a man who is speaking his truth from the heart.  I could really feel myself responding to what Mr. Tolle has written, like it was a wisper of something long ago forgotten.  I have been deeply moved by this work.  <br />The Power of Now was hands down my favorite, but I have to mention that I picked up some other books when I purchased this one.  I also read \\"Present Moment Awareness\\" by Shannon Duncan and loved it.  He seemed to take on the same topic from a different angle, writing about how everyday people with regular lives can become more and more aware.  I really enjoyed it and thought that it complimented The Power of Now very nicely. Obviously so did Eckharts publishers as they published Present Moment Awareness also.  I did like Present Moment Awareness much better than Practicing the Power of Now.  It just felt much more usable.<br />I also read \\"Working on yourself doesn't work\\" by shya kane.  I have to be honest that this work seemed much more like a rehash of the old Est seminars, and like a sales tool for the authors seminars.  I tried to keep an open mind about it, but just found that it didn't seem to come from the heart like The Power of Now and Present Moment Awareness.  Those two books are much better choices, in my humble opinion.
038572179X|5.0|I was glad when I picked up this book. One of the workers at my local bookstore placed a dare for customers - guaranteed money back if they did not truly liked the book. Now, how can someone refuse that!<BR>Ian McEwan created a classic.  This book is funny, witty, and intense. It begins with a single afternoon in the life of Briony Tallis as she takes her 13-year old imagination and transforms the lives of those around her.  All though part one takes place in the course of one afternoon, the rest of the book moves fast and furious.  Mr. McEwan uses Briony to slowly captivate his reader without their knowledge until it is too late and the book is finished and we are left with the feeling of exhaustion and pleasure for we know we have just been prevy to an excellent story.
B000060MY6|2.0|This is a film that I am almost sorry I watched.  It is disjointed and confusing, which by itself would be okay because it does make some sense when you realize it is a dream until the last part of the movie.  What is disturbing to me is that this film has unnecessary scenes, which, as far as I am concerned, are pornographic and don't add anything to the movie. In fact they take away from it. They seem to be included for sensationalism and to satisfy some sick fantasy.  Otherwise the dream symbolism, the way Lynch has used stiff seemingly bad acting on the part of the characters in the beginning, and the way he has used the lighting and affects makes for an interesting study in the genre of fantasy.
B00005AWMF|5.0|I have to admitt, it took time for Sade's work to grow on me. But back in 2000 when &quot;By Your Side&quot; came out, I started to get hooked and after purchasing &quot;Lovers Rock,&quot; I went for this. Now, don't be expecting an album full of variety. Sade has always been a consistent artist and her work sticks to the smooth jazz/R&amp;B vein, but at the same time, it's part of what makes her so great. You pretty much know what you're getting. <br />&quot;Best of Sade&quot; captures her best singles ranging from 1985's &quot;Diamond Life&quot; to 1992's &quot;Love Deluxe.&quot; My favorite Sade song and her biggest pop hit is the classic &quot;Smooth Operator&quot; which represents everything that makes her so great. Her other big hit is here also which is the enjoyable &quot;Sweetest Taboo.&quot; The other songs are for the most part just as good from the haunting &quot;Jezebel&quot; and &quot;Is It A Crime&quot; to the jazzy &quot;Hang On To Your Love.&quot; Sade also had considerable hits with &quot;No Ordinary Love&quot; and &quot;Paradise.&quot; Another one of personal Sade favorites is present here also and that's &quot;Please Send Me Someone To Love.&quot;<br />This is a great relaxation album. Sade is definitely a master at her craft. Smooth vocals, mesmerizing songs...a good buy. Give it time and you'll love it. And if you like Sade, I also recommend Enya.
6305003882|5.0|This is the best DiCaprio movie I have ever seen.  In fact, the only reason I was able to handle such cheesy and girly-type movies like Titanic, is because I had seen DiCaprio in this movie beforehand, and had deduced that he was already an amazing actor.  The scenes in which he was detoxicating from the drugs are utterly amazing, in fact they are so real and life-like that they make you feel Jim Carroll's (DiCaprio) desperation.  But the best scene is when he is crying through a chained door to his mother for some money.  Wow.  The only persons who would not find this movie sincere and life-like are persons who have never left their sheltered academic existences, which seems to be the case in most of the reviews I have thus far read about this movie.  Someone asks: \\"Does anyone know what it is that Jim (Leo) finds in the drawer of his friend's place, after the friend rescues him from freezing in the snow?\\"  Hello!  The point is that we have to imagine that Carroll is telling the story to us...Therefore, we have to assume he didn't quite remember what he took, or that maybe it was not important enough for us to worry about...The point is that it was something small, and perhaps insignificant since in the end his friend is part of the audience which is listening to the reading of his diaries.
B00008DDXC|3.0|First, I loved the movie. The question is, should you buy the DVD? Not if you're over 12 years old.<br />The special features are all very kid-oriented, which is OK because it's mostly a kids' movie, but I wish there were a little something for us \\"grown-ups\\" to look at. The cast interviews focus on the child actors, while the adult actors got only a few seconds each, during which they mostly talk about the child actors. Snape, for example, is in my opinion the most interesting character, and I'd have loved to hear Alan Rickman say something about playing him. And who wouldn't love to hear more from Jason Isaacs or Kenneth Brannagh?<br />The other special features, such as quizzes, games, and tours, have a condescending tone to them that I imagine would even bother younger children. I know it would have bothered me as a child.
0393057658|5.0|Michael Lewis' \\"Moneyball\\" is a wonderful book that attempts to answer a strange paradox according to conventional baseball wisdom: How do the Oakland Athletics, one of the poorest teams in baseball, win so much and win so relentlessly? The answer is, of course, the system that General Manager Billy Beane built that challenged irrational baseball orthodoxy and made the most with the least in an inefficient system.<br />Beane himself was once touted by scouts who thought he had all the right attributes: speed, power, athleticism, and, yes, \\"the Good Face.\\" When his major league career ended bitterly as an unambiguous failure, he turned his other talents to bringing rationality to an irrational baseball establishment. His new tools: statistical analysis, a willingness to discard conventional wisdom, an ability to think, and a demeanor designed to bait unsuspecting GMs into making foolish deals.<br />One of the best scenes from the book is Billy Beane in action during the 2002 trading deadline when he cobbled together a few good and undervalued players to add to the Oakland juggernaut. The funniest line in this section comes from Beane's dealings with the hapless Tampa Bay Devil Rays, a team he fleeced before: \\"[W]hile Tampa Bay's management was willing to talk to Billy, they were too frightened to deal with him.\\" A god among mere mortals indeed.<br />To me, the most engrossing part of \\"Moneyball\\" is the Oakland A's 2002 amateur draft which would lay the foundation of the team in the coming years. While other teams were quite content to gamble and to dream the very possible dream of mediocrity in selecting raw and untested high school players, the A's used their seven first round picks to draft a bunch of college no names the baseball establishment scorned. Why? They were either too short, too fat, too skinny, too slow, or even too ugly to become, in the minds of baseball scouts who supposedly knew better, future stars. Beane rightly dismissed this subjective and irrational hogwash by highlighting attributes the scouts should have paid attention to instead: on base percentage, slugging percentage, walks, strike out-to-walk ratios, and other quantifiable measures that correlate highly to future success.<br />A word on the recent controversy between White Sox GM Kenny Williams and Beane when the former accused the latter of talking too much to Lewis and making Williams look stupid in their lop-sided trades. In \\"Moneyball\\" there is not one section where Beane says anything directly disparaging about his fellow GMs, but the Oakland GM's record nonetheless speaks for itself: GMs like Williams are letting irrational and institutionalized baseball prejudices blind them and Beane took advantage accordingly.<br />In the end, baseball commissioner Bud Selig could continue to continue to chant his mantra that \\"small market teams can't compete\\" over and over until he secures taxpayers' dollars to build every stadium. Teams could continue to ignore the mounting evidence that college players are a good bet and instead blow their money and time chasing down high-risk high schoolers or over-valued mediocrity. In the meantime, the Oakland example will show (and continue to show) that how wrong--and yes, how needlessly stupid--they are.<br />Highly recommended.
0930289234|2.0|I recently read \\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\" and enjoyed it quite a bit, so I decided to read \\"Watchmen\\" after all the rave comments I had been reading.<br />What a disappointment.<br />My biggest complaint is that the story was just plain boring. There are 12 issues, and I couldn't get into it until issue 10. It made some interesting points at times, but all the material is covered better somewhere else (like Claremont/Byrne X-Men, or Marvels, or any of the Busiek/Perez Avengers).<br />I also had a very hard time getting past the humourlessness and lack of any heroic/inspiring material. And sadly, the moral conclusion is WAAAAY off. Great violence leads to more violence - not universal peace. The whole thing left a very bad taste in mouth since the World Trade Center attack.
B00005JLRT|5.0|This latest installment in the Star Trek world is spectacular.  I saw it in the theatre.  It is one of the few films that:<BR>A) Made my palms sweat<BR>B) Occupied my mind for hours afterwards.<BR>The writers and director were not afraid to go farther this time.  They weren't afraid to go 'dark', both in story and in moody dark lighting.  The villian actually seemed evil, as opposed to the utterly predictable villians in most films, including sci-fi.  <BR>The demise of a prominent crewmember was done tastefully, he died honorably in the service of his fellow comrades.  Touching.<BR>There are punchy humor scenes, dramatic tension scenes, and hair-raising split-second actions that all add to heighten the experience of watching this film.  It is very good.<BR>All films have things that can be picked at, but this one has fewer than most.  If you like Star Trek, buy this.  If you are not a Star Trek fan, you will probably still like this film as a movie all by itself.  My non-Trek friends did.
B00008WG3U|5.0|That's right!  NOFX gets very political... finally.  It's nice to NOFX stop being so damn silly for once.  But, don't worry, the War On Errorism isn't a complete stray from the standard NOFX style, but it does take a few nice departures.<br />Here's the album song by song:<br />1.) The Seperation of Church and Skate<BR>A fast \\"old school sounding\\" punk song about how punk rock is very safe now-a-days.  It's more or less a little diss for Good Charlotte and Simple Plan.<br />2.) The Irrationality of Rationality<BR>Very fast song about how it makes no sense to rationalize things that are just plain wrong... like laying off 10,000 workers... or building tons of bombs... or why someone kills.<br />3.) Franco Un-American<BR>Mid-Tempo song with keyboards... Autobiographical song about how Fat Mike went from being a guy who didn't care to a guy who wants to change the world for the better.<br />4.) Idiots Are Taking Over<BR>Fast song about how morons seem to be running and ruining the world. A song about our current president?  You decide...<br />5.) She's Nubs<BR>VERY fast song about a girl with no arms or legs that shows up to a lot of NOFX shows.  Super funny.<br />6.) Mattersville<BR>Catchy, mid-tempo song about over-the-hill punk rocks.  The best line has to be \\"At the end of my cul-de-sac... Davey Havok's house is painted black.\\"<br />7.) Decom-posuer<BR>Fast song about a really cool punk rock girl who may or may not be a posuer.  Only time will tell.<br />8.) Medio-core<BR>Mellow song about how today's music is very bland and unoriginal, not to mention contrived.  (Think Good Charlotte and the Strokes)<br />9.) Anarchy Camp<BR>An old-school ska song about a summer at Anarchy Camp.   Super funny and you can skank the hell out of your skankin' shoes.<br />10.) American Errorist (I Hate Hate Haters)<BR>A very fast song about how you should hate people that want you to not hate how the country is run or how the world is turning it's back on those in need of help.<br />11.) We Got Two Jealous Agains<BR>A fast love song about how Fat Mike knew a girl was the one because she had a lot of the same records that he had.<br />12.) 13 Stitches<BR>A fast, but very quiet song about seeing bands for the first time.  Bands like the Descendents, DRI, and Millions of Dead Cops.  Funny, but touching.<br />13.) Re-gaining Unconsciousness<BR>A fast song about how the ruling class/government takes away your rights and no one cares because it's easier to not care.<br />14.) Whoops, I OD'd<BR>Mellow, sad song about a guy who OD'd a year ago and now he can't have any fun.<br />Anyhow, there ya have it.  If you like NOFX and enjoyed the politics of the Decline, then you will LOVE this album.  Don't worry, though, it doesn't stay too serious for too long.  The music is mostly fast and punk-as-balls.  I own every NOFX album and I rank it as one of their best 3 albums.
B00008WG3U|3.0|It's NOFX again. This disc is pretty good with songs like &quot;Anarchy Camp&quot; and &quot;Seperation of Church and Skate&quot;<BR>A couple of songs have NOFX attempting to play ska, which doesn't sound too great. <BR> It's not NOFX at their best, and their extremely liberal lyrics and cover art shine through very clearly. This CD isn't the best from NOFX, but it's worth buying.
B00000K19E|3.0|I first saw The Matrix when everybody else did and I must say I wasn't nearly affected by it the way most people I know were.  Here's why.  The idea of the world not being what it really seems is not new.  The idea of Kanoe Reeves (&lt;-purposely misspelled) being a savior of any sorts is down right infuriating, it's like entrusting your salvation to a piece of driftwood riddled with knotholes.  The friggin' acting is well, pretty darn bad.  However, the movie has grown on me, and I did like some things about it.<br />The special fx of course were crazy intense, as were the fight scenes.  The set design was sweet and the overall look of the movie definitely portrayed the Wachowski Bros. stark vision of a post-apocalyptic world run by machines.<br />Here we get into another problem, anybody seen The Terminator?  Star Wars?  Then you'll notice things that you've seen in other movies trying to be passed off as fresh and original here.  Now this is a movie, and formulaic recognition gets things greenlighted by studios.  That's fine, I accept that, just don't lie by saying we've never seen this before.  It's an old story told in a new way.  Period.  So, the bottom line is this.  The Matrix is entertaining, granted.  Amazing technically, absolutely.  Life changing, hardly.  Maybe for those who wish their computers were sentient beings so they could abandon the harsh reality of the world this is the mecca of sci-fi.  For those of us non-computer geeks it's merely a popcorn film, with really slow bullets.<br />P.S.  If you want to see the directors not dumbing themselves down for the masses check out Bound for a great noir thriller with some HOT girl on girl action between Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon.
B00006690G|4.0|Eminem did it again. He realeased another cd that will take you by surprise. This the second best eminem cd he ever made. The tracks like Till I collapse f\Nate Dogg and Square dance are priceless. The whole cd had a nice beat to listen to in every song. This is another em' cd with mad lyrics, crazy rymes, story filled songs, major diss's, and much controversy. Some songs are filled with rymes of 9/11 such as Square Dance. He also diss's on his mom in cleanin out my closet talkin of the child hood with his mom and his much diss like for her. He doesn't have another song like in the previous two cd's where he kill's kim but talks much about her in the cd. He did a track with his daughter hailie where she sings the chorus in my dad's gone crazy. D 12 also appears on this alumb with some sweet rymes on tracks such as when the music stops and drips. Another good song is drips f\ obie, a song about your woman cheatin on you with another guy. Dre also appears on this alumb, with his tight rymes and awesome beats. If you get this cd you should get em's first cd, the slim shady lp which is by far the best em' cd.
B00005V9HA|5.0|Stuart Gordon took the classic H.P. Lovecraft story and ran with it bringing to horror fans not only a great film but a genre icon in the form of Jeffrey Combs as Herbert West.  The title pretty much explains the film, it revolves around the idea of raising the dead.  With buckets full of gore and a humorous approach to dismemberment, murder, and insanity there really isn't anything not to like in this film.  Unless you have a weak stomach and in that case ha ha!  Going into detail here would ruin it for first time viewers so I'll just leave with some quotes and a hearty recommendation that anyone who hasn't seen Re-Animator yet do so as soon as possible.  A true celebration of horror, gore, and Lovecraft.  Very, very close to perfection.<br />\\"What were you researching?\\"<br />\\"Death.\\"<br />\\"You make the incision at the base of the skull.\\"<br />\\"Very much like peeling a large orange.\\"<br />\\"Once the skull is clearly visible you take the bonesaw.\\"<br />\\"Don't expect it to tango, it has a broken back.\\"
B00005JLPK|1.0|Me as a Mexican it's awful to see how a mediocre mexican actrees tries to represent the lofe of one of the greatest painters in Mexico. When I saw the movie I saw Salma playing Salma not Salma playing Frida. Also the story it's awful, I saw some comments comming from Diegos daighter and she says that she hates this movie because it's not the true.<BR>Don't watse your time and money buying this DVD, if you want search for \\"Frida, Naturaleza viva\\" or \\" Frida, lived life\\" with Ofelia Medina that's a great movie and a real one.
B00000IQW3|5.0|I don't know how many times I begged to rent this movie when I was little.  The story of a kid from a trailer park with dashed hopes of ever leaving saving the galaxy with his videogame skills is just plain awesome.  The special fx for the time were pretty cutting edge.  The characters were engaging, the action enough to require a double dose of ritalin.  Watching it now is almost as fun as when I was five.  If you like kid friendly sci-fi check this movie out.<br />Get ready!  Blast off!
0887306667|5.0|A reader of this book said that 'the first law of successful marketing is to read and understand this book'. I agree with that and say that it is a must-read for everyone working in marketing.<br /><br />I have been working in this field for almost 5 years and I have realised that marketing people tend to have a wide variety of their own ideas about marketing and how to do it. I know that in this field a lot of the success comes from 'the unsual' and 'the uncommon' strategies, but it also comes from certain rules that have to be respected, because a history of more than 25 years proved that they work.<br /><br />This book is meant to eliminate myths and misconceptions someone might have about the marketing process. Companies spend millions of dollars on marketing thinking that they are chosing the best way to promote their products. But no matter how extraordinary those programs are, sometimes they fail and bring no benefit to the product or the service they promote. The result destroys the identity of the brands, market share decreases, and so do sales. Companies lose a lot of money.<br /><br />The two authors have a  lot of experience in this field and their theories are based clear examples. If marketing people would adjust their promotional programs according to these rules, companies would be much more successful.<br /><br />There are 22 rules in total, applicable to every field, rules that will make you understand why things are the way they are. It will also help you analyse past experience and decide what was wrong and right and avoid doing the same mistakes in the future.<br /><br />It is not an academic book . The language and style are accessible to everybody. The authors give a lot of examples from companies' life that will give you a very clear picture of what is going on the market.<br /><br />Did you know that it is better for a brand to be first on the market than it is to be better? Did you know that the most powerful concept in marketing is owning a word in the prospect's mind?<br /><br />I recommend this book to everyone who wants to learn more about marketing and become a professional in this field. Together with Kotler's &quot;Marketing Management', the '22 Immutable laws ...' should be the marketing people's Bible to be read every day.<br />I am sure it will improve your activities and help you achieve more success.spect's mind?<BR> <BR>I recommend this book to everyone who wants to learn more about marketing and become a professional in this field.

B00000337U|5.0|This record was the one that got me started in the direction of jazz. When I first heard it it was like a revelation, and even if that was 27 years ago (1976) and I was only 15 then, it's still one of my favourites and a record I really wouldn't want to be without.<BR>The record was out of print then, but fortunately Atlantic re-released it in their \\"That's jazz\\"-series.<BR>The record is bristling with joy of playing and the whole thing sounds very fresh, including the writing (mostly by Jarrett). Burton and Jarrett interact nicely and soulfully and Sam Brown really smokes on the guitar, very singing lines of his.<BR>There are some very serene moments in \\"Moonchild/In your quiet place\\" which is succeeded by \\"Como en Vietnam\\" (By Steve Swallow), which is probably the peak of the album, especially with Keiths soprano sax playing on the last vamping part, where he plays furiously, with complete abandon.<BR>All in all: not a single boring moment on the record. <BR>(This goes for the first part, originally released as \\"Gary Burton & Keith Jarrett\\", the second part, \\"Throb\\" by Burton, I have heard, but id didn't make a very big impression.)
B000089RVX|5.0|This is hands down, one of the best albums i have heard in a long time. Unlike most other Rock bands, Amy Lee adds feeling, passion, and emotion into each song. It's almost like you can feel what she feels. Although the sound of her voice drives my mom and friends crazy, I can't get enough of it. I have literally listened to the album every single day since it came out. Songs like ''Going Under'', ''Bring Me To Life'', ''Everybody's Fool'', ''Haunted'', ''Tourniquet'', ''Imaginary'', and ''Whisper'' are the albums highlights.There is a song for just about all of your moods. ''My Immortal'' and ''Hello''are perfect for when your relaxing. Even though the band's name means to fade away, I have a feeling that they won't be ''Going Under'' anytime soon.<br />BOTTOM LINE: The album is a must have. And for all of the people out there that can't stand the band ( Melissa / Mom ), BACK OFF and let us enjoy them without your criticism and stupid remarks !
0446677450|3.0|Over a year after having read it for the first time, I decided to take a second hard look at the book. Some of the concepts that Robert T. Kiyosaki presents in his book have resounded in my head once again. His teachings have helped, I should say: not letting emotions such as fear rule over financial decisions (though it's easier said than done), postponing immediate gratification, and responding with a proactive mind (and a proactive language) in the face of financial adversity.<br />Today, the friend of mine who first recommended Kiyosaki's book to me in on his way out of the rat race, and I find myself in a different place than I was a year ago: I've learned some lessons and I am dying to put others into practice (which I firmly intend to do in the next twelve months).<br />The lessons that impacted me the most:<br />The Rich Don't Work For Money, they have money work for them by creating enough wealth within their assets (and he doesn't count the home they're living in as one, so you can count that one out) to pay for their monthly living expenses, so that they don't need to depend on a job for that, which is the case of most of us. The kind of assets he talks about are businesses that do not require your physical presence: stocks, bonds, mutual funds, income-generating real estate, etc.<br />The book also goes to some extent into some of the advantages of incorporating your own corporation, but it is by no means an exhaustive guide on the topic; it goes into why you should work to learn, not for money. To have each job as a learning ground on which you can build skills which you can later use for yourself as you run your own corporation or company. Does this sound a little selfish? It might be, and that's another paradigm which the book attempts to break: to mind your own business, meaning to do what you have to, but not to loose sight of your financial goal. The author's point is to make the best of each work experience and learn as much as possible from each. Learn about the management of cash flow, systems and people as the key skills needed for success later on.<br />As for negatives, one thing I found about the book was that it needs more editing. At times the author suddenly jumps between thoughts from one paragraph to the next. Ironically enough he admits in the book that he's not one hell of a writer (and he's right about that), but the editor could have done a better job. The other thing is the level of the book. When you're done with it, hopefully (as it did for me) it leaves you thinking, which is a good thing, but it also leaves you with a bunch of questions. Most likely, after having read several of his other books, this was a business-driven decision: not give out the entire 'enchilada' to you in one book, so some of the answers can be found in other books of his, or written by other authors of the 'Rich Dad' series. Other than these two things, the book is interesting, quick to read (doesn't take anything else beyond an open mind) and (if you let it) lifechanging.earn about the management of cash flow, systems and people as the key skills needed for success later on.<br />As for negatives, one thing I found about the book was that it needs more editing.

''My Immortal'' and ''Hello''are perfect for when your relaxing. Even though the band's name means to fade away, I have a feeling that they won't be ''Going Under'' anytime soon.<br />BOTTOM LINE: The album is a must have. And for all of the people out there that can't stand the band ( Melissa / Mom ), BACK OFF and let us enjoy them without your criticism and stupid remarks !
B00006M183|5.0|Pearl Jam continues to evolve. Riot Act is amazing! As good as anything they've ever done. Amazing. Excellent music, beautifully clever lyrics- a work of art and love. Eddie Vedder is the real deal- intelligent, compassionate and courageous. John Lennon and Frank Zappa would have liked him.   Thank-you Pearl Jam for bringing me happiness all these years. Peace love and light.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is hands down, one of the best albums i have heard in a long time. Unlike most other Rock bands, Amy Lee adds feeling, passion, and emotion into each song. It's almost like you can feel what she feels. Although the sound of her voice drives my mom and friends crazy, I can't get enough of it. I have literally listened to the album every single day since it came out, therefore I have no need for any other CD I own. Songs like ''Going Under'', ''Bring Me To Life'', ''Everybody's Fool'', ''Haunted'', ''Tourniquet'', ''Imaginary'', and ''Whisper'' are the albums highlights. The best thing is there is a song for just about each of your moods. Songs like ''My Immortal'' and ''Hello''are perfect for relaxing. Although the band's name means to fade away, I have a feeling that they won't be ''Going Under'' anytime soon.<br />BOTTOM LINE: The album is a must have. And for all of the people out there that can't stand the band ( Melissa / Mom ), BACK OFF and let us enjoy them without your criticism and stupid remarks !
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Once again these Gods of heavy metal, have out shined the rest. Sully and the boys have given us great songs such as Straight Out of Line, Faceless, and I Stand Alone (which was also featured on the Scorpion King soundtrack). The outstanding rifts of the bass (played by Robbie) and guitar (played by Tony) are not to be tangled with. And their new drummer Shannon Larkin fits right in as if he has played with them for ever. Sully's booming voice is never underestimated, showing that Godsmack and Godsmack only, could make this kind of music.
B00005JKDR|4.0|I thought the movie was great overall and i am 15 years old. My friend saw it with his little sister and told me it was good so i watched my brothers copy.  James &quot;Sully&quot; Sullivan (John Goodman) and Mike Waczoski(Billy Cristal)were hilarious as monsters.  My friends and I found the two teenage interns as histarical. The other &quot;baby&quot; monsters were funny especially the one who continually yelled &quot;Mike Waczoski!&quot;. The character &quot;Boo&quot; touched me...i dont know why.  But the strangest thing about it was after i saw the movie and the happy ending (viewers know what im talking about)i was still sad. Perhaps it was how Boo was taken away from before, i dunno.  Anyway buy the movie its great! The special features are cool too!
B00003CXTG|1.0|It took some doing, but director Michael Bay and company have turned this historical event, rich in story and importance, into a boring, trivial soap opera. In this film, the Japanese invasion of Pearl Harbor, the event that shook America off the fence into World War II, serves as a distant backdrop to a childish, stupid romance between forgettable young actors. Ben Affleck turns in another white-bread, adolescent, self-absorbed performance. Will this guy ever grow up to realize there is a big world beyond him? The female lead, Kate Beckinsale, is forgotten the moment the film is over. To say the film lacks weight is being kind. The filmmakers seem to have no understanding of what Pearl Harbor was to this country and wished instead to make a music video. Lastly, this movie serves perfectly to show the limits of computer generated special effects. Leave computer graphics to movies about hobbits and trolls. When trying to recreate history, you have to really blow things up. In Pearl Harbor (the film) all the explosions and air battles are brightly colored, but there is no sense of reality, of danger, of real things blowing up. If you want to know how this kind of film should be done, see Tora! Tora! Tora! instead. That was a serious film about a serious moment in history (plus the explosions and destruction happened in \\"real time\\")!
B000002B1M|5.0|This is the Best Album ever put in the music stores man this is a classic this is way better than illmatic all the beats is right i love this joint.
0553381709|1.0|I normally never buy a newly released fantasy book because I have this strange desire of actually wanting a frickin' end to the stories I read.  Seeing this third book released, I figured I was safe - oh, how wrong I was.  Three thousand pages of story and very little is resolved.  I recommend waiting a couple of years and then visiting your local half-price bookstore.  In the meantime, go read something else.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Where to start - I enjoyed this CD a lot.  It's hard to believe it didn't take home an Emmy.  From its basic conceit of a musical demon to all the plotlines swirling around in BtVS at the time - this episode was integral to Buffy but able to stand on it's own.  For somebody who'd never written music, Joss Whedon did a masterful job.  And even the actors who couldn't sing well sang with heart - and those who could sing (Amber Benson and Tony Head most esp.) really belted it out.  My personal favorite was Something to Sing About, a sad duet between Spike and Buffy.  My only complaint is that the cover has Xander and Dawn(who didn't sing a lot) and Willow (who had maybe two lines) and relegated the great singers (Spike, Tara, Giles and Anya) to the back cover.
B00005JLXE|5.0|I saw this movie very late, after it hit the discount theaters.  I had heard mixed reviews and I was VERY surprised at how well the film worked.  Daredevil tries things no other superhero film ever has and it succeeds on every level.  Jennifer Garner is a GODDESS.  Colin Farrell is AMAZING and Ben Affleck surprised even me.  See it!  I will buy the DVD when it comes out.
0151008116|3.0|I translated the book into Catalan (Barcelona? Does it ring a bell?), and I must say I don't find it so disappointing as some reviewers say. I am not referring to the religious aspects in the novel, but to the de-humanization, either on a boat or surrounded by thousands of people: when it comes to our survival, or our basic needs, we are beasts. It does not matter what we are taught by religions, or social conditions, or family values: when we badly need something, Mr Hyde takes over Dr Jekyll.<br />And strictly about the novel: is the &quot;adventure&quot; disgustingly believable? Then I believe that the writer has achieved his goal.
B00005JKPF|5.0|Well I have no idea where to begin how amazed I am at the second installment in the blossoming X-Men movie franchise. The first movie from 2000 was a great start but had quite a few flaws to it and had a lot of room for improvement from there. Well, I'm proud to say that a good amount of that room is filled up with with lots more action packed storyline and much more intense plot. Let me just say that \\"X2: X-Men United\\" is a marvelous follow-up to the first X-Men movie and while that movie was very good, this one trashes that one by a mile with much more action-packed plot and greater intensity.<br />This movie also brings a lot of new characters into the picture such as Nightcrawler and newcomer Pyro.<br />The movie begins with the human and mutant societies sharing the planet except that the skyrocketing prejudices have polarized the two societies following an incident in D.C. and the anti-mutant hysteria reaches dangerous levels to where a vicious anti-mutant army general named William Stryker (Played by Brian Cox) launches an attack against the School For The Gifted and uses an experimental drug that manages to control the minds of mutants and makes them answer any questions that Stryker asks them and is on a quest to build his own version of Cerebro to use against the mutant population through the mind of the now captive Charles Xavier. Meanwhile Magneto escapes from the plastic prison and unlike the last movie, he teams up with his former rivals to fight against Stryker's forces. Meanwhile Wolverine goes back to Canada to try to remember his past and encounters the site of the long abandoned experimental lab, or is it abandoned?<br />This movie, following the footsteps of the first X-Men movie, has tons and tons of action packed sequences, and much darker and bitterer atmosphere to the movie especially towards the ending.<br />This movie still has it's flaws but nowhere near as much as the previous X-Men movie. Rogue, seaming looking more like a pure victim than a psychologically scarred character, plummets from a potential super heroine down to just a background character and played virtually no part in the events in the movie. I just hope that she plays a MUCH larger role in the next X-Men movie, whenever that one comes out. Storm fared a little better than in the last one, showing more personality and character and more intelligence but still nowhere near as much of the punch that the comic book character really has. Gambit still hasn't surfaced yet and he's one of my favorite characters. In terms of the missing characters, it's not necessarily bad that their not here as the comic books have SO many characters that it's impossible to bring every one of them onto one movie so I can't necessarily blame the moviemakers for leaving them out in this movie. Hopefully, Gambit, Jubilee, and Beast will surface in the next installment in this marvelous franchise.<br />On the other extreme though, the characters that fared well in the first movie, are even better than they were in the last one. Wolverine shows a chilling rage during the beginning part of the movie. Patrick Stewert proves that he IS Professor Charles Xavier. No one in my opinion could've played Xavier better than Stewert. Sir Ian McKellan does even better as the villainous master of magnetism Magneto. Magneto is even more chilling in this movie than in the last one. To me, it's great to see the rivalry between Magneto and Xavier continue to develop yet they have to work together to stop Stryker and to me, it shows how it seems like Xavier and Magneto are like two sides of the same coin but each side has conflicting goals. Brian Cox though steals the spotlight as he gives a chilling role as the extremely evil general William Stryker. Most of the rest of the characters are also improved. We also bring in Kurt Wagner a.k.a. Nightcrawler and also future villain Pyro. There are lots more characters besides the ones I mentioned that deserve attention but the three I mentioned are the highlights.<br />I view X2 as the movie where the possible war between mutants and normal humans seems to be in the beginning stages of this movie and it almost parallels what the possible outcome would be in the real world should prejudice overtake the minds of the societies of our world and lead to destructive rioting and even civil warfare. I think that both this and the first X-Men film have powerful messages of the dangers of discrimination against those who are `different' and how it causes devastation on all sides of the conflict.<br />The special effects once again are amazing and the Cerebro room is absolutely amazing and how it shows the locations of the normal humans and the locations of the mutant populations. It almost is unsettling to see especially if there is technology that can locate every living human on the planet.<br />This movie is getting a lot of the justice that it deserves with it's success at the box office along with Spider Man. I have to say that this is the age of Marvel Comic moviemaking and the blossoming of two powerful franchises and let's hope they have a long lifetime as opposed to what happened with the Batman movie series with the disastrous \\"Batman & Robin\\" movie. It can't stop here with the second X-Men movie though. There's just so much more to bring out that this movie needs to continue well past the second X-Men movie. Until all that happens, \\"X2\\" will definitely deliver the action and entertainment to keep us entertained until it happens. Perhaps the third one should involve the Sentinels.<br />\\"X2\\" is a near epic result of great casting, great script, and strong plot and is destined to become a future classic. There's more than I can give out in words.I mentioned are the highlights. <br />I view X2 as the movie where the possible war between mutants and normal humans seems to be in the beginning stages of this movie and it almost parallels what the possible outcome would be in the real world should prejudice overtake the minds of the societies of our world and lead to destructive rioting and even civil warfare.

0060012358|4.0|A Review by Chet<br />The only thing keeping these wise rats inline is Maurice, the cat who knows it all, followed closely by his young piper. The rats controlled by Maurice, go around threatening of plague in the Europe during the late 1800s, when paid the piper boy comes to bring the rats to back to do it once again. Agreeing to be there final threat, the rats go into play to get the routine plague but run into a scam in play and get into a mess of trouble.<br />The parts I liked was that that there was always a conflict going on and making you want to read on and discover the solution, whether its internal or external. Another part is that the main character is a cat, not a human but a talking cat thats constantly persuading those around him. Although its a great book, the read switches back and forth between the rats and the cat right at the time something happens, making you forget when it comes back to the last one.<br />I would recommend this book to the younger readers in the age range of 6-8th, though in 9th I received a real thrill out of reading it. Theres a mix of fantasy and drama, along with the occasional humor.
B00008J4P5|5.0|The White Stripes are a band steeped in gimmick. Perpetually blushed in their Candy-Queer color tones, refusing to play certain MTV standards live, igniting (and re-igniting) the Meg-Jack Chinatown myth factor (\\"she's my sister-she's my mother-she's my ex-wife-she's my cousin\\") and brilliantly formulating an almost Tennessee Williams-ish world around themselves, they have created their own genre. They will play Betty Boop cartoons before they play. While onstage Jack will speak in a Southern accent (he's from Detroit) and their new album is dedicated to \\"the death of the sweetheart.\\" Whatever that means...<br />If this were any other band, all this confetti would have grown old long ago. But the White Stripes are a band with true talent. Their music seamlessly melds with their simple, focused aesthetic, and they are gifted musicians. Their new album, \\"Elephant\\", attests to that. This album is as poppy and as evocative as any of their earlier efforts, but it is somehow stronger. The songs fit together better, they are expertly written, produced, and played. The \\"death of the sweetheart\\" certainly does seem the theme here, with songs about disillusion, clawing your way back up the mountain, blackened lust, broken hearts, and angry meditations on fame \\"so completely stupid--just go away!\\"<br />The White Stripes seemingly kickstarted the current revolution-- back to the basics rock n' roll, but they had something else: a New Orleans-style scratchy, smoky blues take on things. Their early efforts, although derivative of everything from Otis Redding to 70s-style guitar rock like Deep Purple, were unique on the face of modern music. However, their blues-style riffs matched with a keening garage rock sensibility that Jack cultivated, produced uneven results. More often than not their stongest songs were covers, like Dylan's \\"One More Cup of Coffee\\" or Dolly Parton's \\"Jolene.\\" <br />Everything changed on \\"White Blood Cells\\" where lags in that album's focus and energy were peppered with modern-pop anthems like \\"Hotel Yorba\\" and \\"Fell in Love with a Girl.\\" More so on \\"Elephant.\\" This is the album where all the fluids come together, so to speak. Their blues, garage rock, retro-country ballads and the like, are all perfectly in synch here. Pretty much every song is a gem. And the album is a lot of fun.<br />I find it hilarious that the White Stripes make any band with more than two members look ridiculous. It really is only Jack and Meg (I've seen them play!) but their sound is enormous. It's also funny that this album was recorded in London (at apparently the only studio on the planet archaic enough to shun the use of any digital technology) while it has the sound and feel of something put together in a shack beside the swamps of Louisiana. In terms of novelty treats here, you've all heard by now they succumb to using basslines in the slick, dark, grainy opener \\"Seven Nation Army\\"--a fantastic, brooding rock song. The bass isn't an eye-opener, and doesn't throw anything awry in terms of their overall sound. Yes, also, Meg solos: \\"In the Cold, Cold Night\\" a feverish, barebones love song, which gives the impression of someone singing alone at night in their cracked-open front door. But Meg isn't really much of a vocalist. Her percussive efforts are much more gripped, varied, and essential.<br />The album has several other high-energy rockers. \\"Black Math\\" is a great, 70's-style tour de force, and the strangely-structured \\"There's No Home For You Here\\" will stick in your head in the oddest ways, even when you don't expect it to. On \\"I Don't Know What To Do With Myself\\" Burt Bacharach goes the way of Led Zeppelin with mindboggling results. Only the White Stripes could pull off the piano-driven \\"I Want To Be The Boy To Warm Your Mother's Heart\\"--a beautiful, passionate pop song ballad that ranks as one of my favorites of this band.<br />The album's energy skydives a bit midway-thru. \\"You've Got Her In Your Pocket\\" is soft ... and delightful, this album's \\"We're Going To Be Friends.\\" And then we have \\"Ball And Biscuit\\" and \\"The Hardest Button To Button\\" two sweeping, clasic-rock-style surging rock n'rollers (the latter being the stronger track) that hark back to their debut album. I don't like these songs as much, I don't find them as interesting as the rest of the CD, and always at this point I tune out for a bit. Others will disagree. But the last part of the album is a true shocker: it comes at you full force, and here is where the Stripes show their true talent for musicianship and manipulation. \\"Little Acorns\\" is an amazing work, as is my favorite song on this CD (and seemingly underappreciated) the hypnotic \\"Hypnotize\\" which has the same lyrical power that Nirvana's \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" did more than a decade ago, as does its follow-up, \\"The Air Near My Fingers\\" which boasts some of Jack's best guitar work. \\"Girl, You Have No Faith In Medicine\\" is a mosh-pit shouter, but the closing track, \\"Well It's True That We Love One Another\\" is one of the most charming, clever little tunes I have every heard end an album.<br />All in all, \\"Elephant\\" seems the White Stripes album destined for classic status, and destined to appeal to a wider pool of listeners. It is definitely worth having. In years to come, you'll wander into that cool, hip vintage clothing store whether in the East Village or in New Orleans, and inevitably there'll be that \\"Be Like The Squirrel Girl\\" T-shirt hanging there. Won't you want to know what that means...<br />....Sweetheart?
0316666343|1.0|I too fell for the hype. So much has been mentioned over the past few months about this novel and I fell for it and bought it.  As stated in previous reviews, after the first chapter or two, where the shock and horror of the experience of the murder and rape of a young teenage girl has you focused on the events as opposed to the writing, you find yourself surrounded by poorly developed characters, a non-sensical story-line and page after page of silliness.  This novel doesn't know what it wants to be... a serious crime-solver novel, a teenage soap opera, a romance, a supernatural thriller... too bad.
B000000OTU|5.0|This is one of the greatest, greatest hits albums. It doesn't however contain the stuff released in the 70's such as Walk This Way, Sweet Emotion, Dream On and Come Together.  For those you'll need to buy the album entitled Aerosmith Best Of.<br />For their late 80's and early 90's hits though which were most of their biggest this is the album for you.  Love in An Elevator is on here although if you like the Going Down introduction to the song you will have to buy the album Pump as it's not on here.  Livin' On the Edge, Dude (Looks Like A Lady), Janie's Got a Gun and Rag Doll or all here and any one of them is worth buying this album for alone.<br />There's also a live version of Dude (Looks Like a Lady) from San Diego.  It's a pretty good version.  There's two songs you won't find elsewhere Walk on Water and Blind Man.  Neither are classics but are pretty good.  There's really no fillers on here even there less known hits are still great.  All the lyrics are also included so if you not really an Aerosmith fan but like some of their songs then this is the album for you.
0783114222|5.0|What can be said about this? <br />Tom Hanks got the bug for Space doing \\"Apollo 13\\" and took it to greater heights with this fantastic portrayal of the people, times and achievements of the Apollo era. On one hand this gives a detailed technical account of how Man first set foot on the Moon. But it is more than that, giving an understanding of the effects on the wives, reporters, back room staff, astronauts, scientists, engineers and other people of the hundreds of thousands that made Apollo possible.<br />Some aspects are universally known, such as the aforementioned Apollo 13, and so are given a different twist. Others are little known and therefore welcome a more detailed portrayal. Each mission is used as a backdrop to plot a particular storyline. Alan Shepard's Meniere's Disease. The reporting of missions changing from, in some respects, friendly cooperative to hostile intrusive reporting. The hard lives of astronauts wives. The Apollo 1 fire. The difficulties in America in 1968. All are carefully and effectively portrayed.<br />Particularly enjoyable - as a spacecraft engineer and scientist myself - are the episodes about the development of the Lunar Module (partly, I think as the Grumman engineer Tom Kelly got a particularly bad deal during \\"Apollo 13\\" and Hanks wanted to say sorry), and those about the geologists Silver and El Baz who taught the astronauts how to observe the moon, not just see it.<br />The whole production is based considerably on the Andrew Chaikin book \\"A Man On The Moon\\" which has become the definitive account of the Apollo program. <br />The DVD set is expensive, but very well worth the outlay. So is Chaikin's book. Buy them both.
B00005QENZ|4.0|Not a bad album but all the big songs are on their album Big Ones so you may want to purchase that instead. There are still some great songs on here which aren't on there such as Fever, Can't Stop Messin' and Shut Up and Dance. The Intro track also has the guitar action from Walk This Way together with other music and lyrics and is pretty good.<br /><br />If you only want one Aerosmith Album buy Big Ones but if you want some good Aerosmith songs then you'll find them here
6305064490|5.0|Decorate the tree, light a candle or three, sit down with the mulled wine and cuddle in with your better half for this one. How to realise that life is sometimes better than you realise.<br />James Stewart gives an unforgettable performance as the hometown boy who always planned, but never succeeded, to escape to Tahiti and the big world that was surely waiting for him. Instead he stayed in smallville, married his high school sweetheart, built up the family Savings and Loan, fought off the bully-boy tactics of the local mogul, and unknowingly secured himself a place in the hearts of most of his townfolk's hearts. <br />A warming, enchanting tale of how we sometimes lose track of how wonderful life can be, and often is.<br />Merry Christmas! And remember to ring a bell every so often - to give out those angels wings ....
B000002G26|5.0|This is one of the better greatest hits albums out there although later albums do have some good songs on them as well.  Summer of 69 is one of the biggest songs of all time and worth purchasing this album for alone.  A lot of the other big hits such as Everything I Do I Do it For You are found on his album Waking Up the Neighbours so depending on which songs are your favourites you may wish to buy that one instead as it's just as good.  Songs not on that album but on this one which are sensational are Please Forgive Me, Kids Wanna Rock, and Run to You.  You really should purchase both albums.<br /><br />This album doesn't contain the lyrics to the songs and has an address where you can send money to and get a booklet with them which is pretty disgraceful.
B00004U8P9|5.0|I loved going to \\"Rocky Horror\\" when I was in college, but watching on home video just wasn't the same.  I'm probably committing heresy but there's a reason why this sci-fi, horror, B-movie satire, rock musical didn't really make it big until theaters started showing it as a midnight movie and fans started attending in costume and talking back to the screen.  The 25th anniversary DVD, with several audience participation options, really is the next best thing to being there.<br />For the uninitiated, \\"Rocky Horror\\" tells the story of two clean-cut American youths, uptight Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick of \\"Spin City\\") and Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon of \\"Dead Man Walking\\") whose car breaks down on a dark, deserted road in the middle of a storm--the classic beginning to many horror movies--and who seek help at a nearby castle.  Castles, as Rocky fans know, don't have phones!  What this castle has instead is a cross-dressing mad scientist Frank-N-Furter Tim Curry, in perhaps his finest performance), two very creepy servants, Riff-Raff (Richard O'Brien, who wrote the musical) and Magenta (Patricia Quinn), and various other hangers-on, including lovers Columbia (Little Nell) and biker Eddie (Meat Loaf).  Brad and Janet walk in on a party celebrating the creation of Frank-N-Furter's muscle-bound boy-toy \\"Rocky.\\"  Bed-hopping chaos soon ensues, until the servants reveal their true identities and take control.<br />Punctuating this wacky plot are some of the wildest rock-musical songs ever written.  In addition to the classic \\"Time Warp,\\" there's O'Brien's salute to cult-classic B-movies, \\"Science Fiction Double Feature,\\" Meat Loaf's \\"Hot Patootie,\\" and Sarandon ode to sexual self-discovery, \\"Toucha Toucha Touch Me!\\"<br />So much for the \\"Rocky virgin\\" portion of the review...  What makes the DVD so exceptional is the chance to experience \\"Rocky Horror\\" at home nearly like you would in the theater.  The DVD has the option of turning on the audience screen comments as well as another option for viewing members of the Rocky Horror Fan Club performing select scenes before returning to the main movie.  For those less familiar with audience participation, the DVD can prompt when to throw toast, toilet paper, rice, etc., light a match, put your newspaper on your head, etc.<br />The second disc contains fascinating interviews with cast members, where fans can find out about their reaction to starring in this cult classic.  Meat Loaf's description of not realizing what \\"Rocky Horror\\" was going to be about and running out of the theater when Tim Curry entered wearing fishnet stockings, spiked heels, a merry widow, and a leather jacket and singing \\"Sweet Transvestite\\" is hysterical.  Patricia Quinn talks about how her fondness for the opening song, \\"Science Fiction Double Feature\\" made her want to take the role even though she hadn't read the rest of the script.  What?  Don't remember Quinn singing that number?  In the stage versions she did, but the song got reassigned in the film version--and Quinn makes her feelings about that QUITE clear.  Sarandon makes the interesting observation that \\"Rocky Horror\\" probably kept a lot of art house theaters in business over the years, since they could count on good revenue from the midnight movie, even if the latest regular-hours offering flopped.  In Bostwick's interview, however, the actor sounds a bit like William Shatner giving his anti-Trekkie diatribe on \\"Saturday Night Live.\\"<br />The only disappointments on the DVD are that the outtakes really aren't that interesting and actor bios aren't provided.  I would have liked to see what else the \\"minor\\" cast members did after Rocky, but that information is limited to a few lines in the companion booklet.  Also, some of the audience-participation comments are nearly impossible to understand because fans are talking over each other.  But then that's part of the modern-day theater experience.  Even Sarandon noted in her interview that talking back to the screenhas gone from the more unison catechism approach to a loud free-for-all.<br />What seemed so risqu&eacute; and shocking a few decades ago seems much more innocent today, but it was great when it all began and it's still great!  If you've never ventured into the theater to experience \\"Rocky Horror,\\" this is the best way to experience it at home.
B000001DVV|5.0|Ugly Kid Joe may have been one album hit wonders but the fact still remains this is a sensational album.  Everything About You was a huge hit and a much needed song in the face of all the soppy love songs around.  Neighbor was also a great song, in fact all the songs on this album are great there are no fillers.  Of course the other big song from this album was Cats In the Cradle a much better version than Cat Stevens' one.  Mr. Recordman although not released to my knowledge, was played a bit and became a bit of a cult hit anyway.  I also particularly like Madman.<br /><br />Don't punish this album by not buying it because Ugly Kid Joe promised so much and created their terrible second album about Milkman's sons and other stuff.  It's not the album's fault who it's parents are.  This is a sensational no filler album and one you should add to your collection. Lyrics are also included.
B00006RU5B|4.0|When I first bought this cd I was a bit skeptical. I was a huge rage fan and a huge soundgarden fan, but I couldn't picture possibly mixing the two. It just seemed like an odd combination. As a matter of fact, upon first listen, I dismissed this as garbage. I hated it. Plus, the ink on the CD design is really disgusting and it makes the cd actually smell bad. The smell never fades. This is a smelly cd. But, despite the awful stench, this CD really grew on me. This is as a good, solid pure hard rock album as one will ever see. This is not metal. This is not rapcore, or hardcore or punk. This is good old fashioned rock and roll. Audioslave has the benfits of one of the best vocalists of the 90's combined with one of the greatest rock guitarists of all time. Catchy guitar riffs (though not as good as rage) will lure you in instantly on the breakout hit Cochise. Other standouts include Exploder, Hypnotize, Shadow on the Sun, and Gasoline( in which you can almost hear Zak de la Rocha's rappy voice come in during the opening hook). There are also plenty of cool ballads such as I am the Highway and Like a Stone in which you can feel the angst in Cornell's soul. This is a great CD for any fan of eiter members previous work. Brad Wilk and Tim Commerford put forth decent showings as well on drums and bass, respectively. This CD just works.
B000001EHS|5.0|A lot of the sensational songs on this album are from the Adrenalize album so you may want to check that one out and if they're the ones you're after and it's cheaper buy it instead.  This does have some big songs not contained on that one though.  The best would be Pour Some Sugar on Me a sensational fast soft rock song.  Action is another superb fast song and could be played during any sporting highlights show.  Love Bights is also excellent but may be a bit too 80's sounding for those who don't like songs that sound 80's.  Let's Get Rocked and the two slower songs Make Love Like a Man and Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad are also on the Adrenalize album and are sensational.<br />There are a few songs on here that are pretty average but a lot that are good to have on just as background music.  Some of the lyrics are pretty heavy in accent and you have to read the title to know what they're singing about such as Photograph and Armageddon It, as if you don't you'll think they're saying something else. I swear they were singing I'm a gay man for Armageddon It before I read the title.  This isn't as good as other 80's band greatest hit albums such as Crossroad by Bon Jovi but is definitely still worth owning.<br />The cover insert does not have any lyrics but does have comments on the songs included.
B00005JLSE|5.0|You owe it to yourself, that if you saw \\"Moulin Rouge\\" in a movie theater, you definitely would be missing a fine opportunity to see a movie musical, filmed as it should be filmed - for the Big Screen. The musical numbers would be (obviously) best seen this way, but still...<br />The ending of \\"All I care About..\\" is pure 40s/50s tribute in 'framing' the end of a number onstage, as tho it was there, LIVE. And for shots and stuff like this, I was immeidately hooked as a fan of the film, from the first (of 15, so far!!!) viewings and will still continue to go see it on a movie theater screen as long as it's playing somewhere, in Vancouver (Canada).<br />The main disappointment about the DVD, therefore, will be, not having that BIG SCREEN to see it on ( for the majority of me/you/us out there?)...&lt;sigh> But that's ok. All the special features listed here, make it look promising. especially the \\"rehearsal footage.\\" Yes!<br />Probably worth buying, the DVD is. But PLEASE owe it to yourself and the film, to go find a movie theater it's still playing in - and SEE IT BIG !!!  &lt;grin>
B000002GJS|5.0|This 15 track huge album would easily be Bryan Adam's best and since most of his albums sound pretty similar this is the one you should buy.  This album has your mix of fast rock songs as well as slow love ballads.  Everything I Do I Do it For You was the song played in Robin Hood Prince of Thieves and was of course one of the top selling songs of all time.  Can't Stop This Thing We Started is a sensational fast song as is All I Want is You.  Not Guilty, House Arrest and Vanishing are other gems.  There are no bad songs on this album unlike his other albums which seem to have a few fillers.<br /><br />I think this album is better than So Far so Good which is an alternative album a lot of people buy instead of this, as it was a Greatest Hits so far album that cashed in on the success of this album, including all the singles from this one, primarily the song Everything I Do I Do it For You, with both albums out when a lot of these songs were yet to be released as singles. Although Waking Up the Neighbours of course doesn't have Summer of 69.  If you want one Bryan Adams album but only one I'd buy this one.<br /><br />This album also has the lyrics to all the songs whereas So Far so Good just has an address you post a cheque to get them sent to you.
0812550706|4.0|I think the best part of this book was the surprise ending, where a world of feeling that wasn't always as visible earlier on blossoms out and convinces you to read the rest of the series.<br />I had mixed feelings about the book until I got near the end.  It's a little different from most sci fi I've read in that it is not really a novel of ideas or exploration; it has a lighter feel.  There's nothing wrong with that, and its focus on character and interaction are commendable, as are its readability and fluency.  <br />The book's main problems are structural.  Where I had a bit of a problem with it was in the amount of time and space spent on the game; there were so many pages devoted to descriptions of the game that at times it dragged.  This also contributed to the book's lightweight feeling and it often made the book seem more like the first part of a longer book, which is not the same as the first book in a series.  The amount of time spent on the game, which was really introductory to the main plot events, made the book feel unbalanced.  This problem is compounded by the fact that the climax was very brief; and it was concealed by a plot device so that you didn't actually know it was the climax until after it was over!  It carries very little weight.  Finally, a whole new vista on everything that came before is opened up in the last few moving pages, altering your view of the whole thing and providing a degree of thoughtfulness, significance, and emotional weight that were largely missing until that point.<br />It was only in those last few pages that I knew for sure I would read the rest of the series.
B000000OQF|5.0|This is one of the classic 80's rock albums. The music although obviously 80's rock in style hasn't really dated much today. Sweet Child O Mine has one of the best guitar introductions ever thought of and recorded into a song.  Paradise City and Welcome to the Jungle were the other two massive hits off this album but the other songs on here aren't bad either.  There are no fillers on this album.  This album would be a fair bit cleaner than their other albums but still contains a bit of language in the non release songs.  Unlike other bands and even on some of their own albums the swearing isn't pointless and out of place but actually fits the songs.<br />If you're only going to buy one Guns N Roses album you should buy this one.  The cover booklet has all the lyrics and some weird 80's futuristic art.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Chicago as I have been told by many people is just good entertainment so I went and I was really entertained. It is funny , lots of great music and just an all round fantastic time at the movies. If you like good quality movies then you should like Chicago.
B000000OSG|5.0|There are many debates as to which is the better Illusion album and I'd have to say I still haven't really decided after all these years but if pressed I would say this one.  There are great songs on both and also a few average ones as well.  This one has the massive song from the Terminator II movie You Could Be Mine and is worth buying just for that alone.  Yesterdays, 14 Years, Breakdown and Don't Cry (alt. Lyrics) are sensational as well.  Knockin' On Heaven's Door is great but not as good their single version that you hear on the radio with no voice interruptions of It wasn't My fault! What else was I supposed to do? and so on, which I thought set this song apart from previous artists versions.  I like Civil War especially the intro which is from the film Cool Hand Luke.  Get In the Ring is pretty stupid pointless swearing song and seems to be written apposing some journalist remarks they didn't like.  My World is a short song which isn't a bad thing as it's pretty stupid.<br />Buy this along with Illusion I they both have a substantial number of sensational songs.  Lyrics are included for you to sing along to as well.
B000005S6B|5.0|Forget the politics and the drinking and the fighting, forget the stereotype, this album defies categorisation. Like most all truly brilliant albums its transcends musical genres. A good song is a good song right? and this album is full of good songs: Indeed fairytale of New York is not just the best Christmas song of all time, it is one of THE best songs of all time, period. If you dont believe me check it out, this song alone is worth the price. Due to contractual reasons there was a long gap between the recording of this album and their previous one: during this time the band toured constantly and added a couple of new members. All this had the effect of improving their technique and musicianship, not to mention their songwriting. By the time they came to record they were straining at the leash, and boy what an album!! Just get it!!!
B000000OSE|4.0|There are many debates as to which is the better Illusion album and I'd have to say I still haven't really decided after all these years.  There are great songs on both and also a few average ones as well.  Overall however this is a sensational album.  The mega hit Don't Cry and the probably a bit too long November Rain are contained within.  Some other brilliant songs on this one are Live and Let Die a remake of the James Bond classic theme song.  Bad Apples with a bit of a Redneck theme in the intro.  Don't Damn Me is also pretty good.  Perfect Crime and Double Talkin' Jive are good but tarnished by a bit of pointless out of place swearing that seems to be on there for no reason other then to say we're bad or something.  Coma is a bit stupid but You Ain't the First and Right Next Door to Hell are up there with the best.  Dust N' Bones, Dead Horse and The Garden are also worth listening to.<br /><br />The lyrics are included in the CD booklet and overall this isn't a bad album and contains some sensational songs.
B00006ALGL|5.0|This is a truly incredible album. I have given 5 stars to albums before but now I wish I hadn't cos this album is beyond 5 stars.  I was painting the house at the time when I first heard it, and had to stop and listen! It blew me away; It makes you wonder how someone could create and deliver songs of such beauty and depth armed with little more than a guitar, some stunning vocals from Damien and partner Lisa, and the occasional use of strings! Its hard to single out individual tracks as the album just flows effortlessly from track #1 to the final track but Blowers Daughter,Amie and Eskimo are my faves. I cannot recommend it highly enough, but suffice to say when my son borrowed it (without telling me!) I had withdrawal symptoms. This is a truly great album and I hope it is promoted properly in the USA so as many people as possible can hear it and buy it. Damien Rice deserves to be a massive star.
B00005QEO1|5.0|This album has probably been made rather obsolete by Big Ones their greatest hits album but is still worth owning for a few reasons.  Going Down the third track is the introduction to Love In an Elevator which isn't found on Big Ones.  As is Water Song for Janie's Got a Gun and Dulcimer Stomp for The Other Side.  Those songs just aren't the same without those intros.<br />The other songs on here are pretty good too so even if you've got their album Big Ones I'd buy this album too.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album is easily one of the best albums of the 90's and is, in my opinion, Radiohead's greatest album.
B000001DV2|5.0|This is a sensational album with some huge songs on it.  Let's Get Rocked a song substituting the word Rock for the F word is a brilliant piece of artistry that enabled it to be played on the radio and become a hit.  Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad is a brilliantly written ballad about loving someone that you can never had.  Similar to Always by Bon Jovi in theme but not music wise.  I Wanna Touch U is another sensational fast rock song as is Personal Property.<br />There are no lyrics just photographs of the band members in the CD insert.  All songs on this album are listenable to.  There are no bad ones on here
B00005JKPF|4.0|I did not see the first X-men movie. When I saw X2 I could follow the story perfectly. So if you haven't see the first one, you will still enjoy the second film. My favorite character in this film was Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler, he vanishes in a mist to reappear again - and his character also prays the Rosary. The special effects were incredible. Through the entire scene where Nightcrawler is in the White House, after the President, I was just in awe. Alan Cumming spent hours in makeup for this character, and it was well worth it. The other special effects are also stunning as well. It is an absolutely fun movie, with great special effects.
B00000DHRZ|3.0|Named for some reason after what we in Australia call a pepperoni pizza, this album has a few sensational songs but also like all Offspring albums contains a lot of poorly written album filler ones with pointless out of place swearing that seems to be there for no reason but to try and promote themselves as rebels or something.<br />This CD also has a fair number of Quicktime movies which when you put the disc in your computer tell you to install them on your computer and that you need Quicktime even if you already have quick time.  Quitting that load it directly through Quicktime.<br />There you will find the film clips to three songs from previous albums, All I Want, Choose and Gone Away.  There is also some pointless stuff like the CD Extra logo in a ten second film and another for the credits.  It also has versions of Pretty Fly, Get a Job and Staring at the Sun with photographs of some people they met somewhere with the lyrics from the songs on the screen even thought the lyrics are not actually sung in these song versions.  There's also the trailer to some video they made which doesn't look great.  There's also a behind the scenes type video.<br />Buy this album for the few good released songs on it or for the film clips of previous songs but don't expect anything other than fillers for the other tracks.
B000059XUO|5.0|\\"The Crow\\" is an excellent movie. Brandon did wonderfully, unfortunately the young actor was killed within the making (RIP Brandon Lee 1965-1993). The plot was a justified revenge story. Eric Draven (Brandon Lee) and his girlfriend, Shelly Webster (Sofia Shinas), were both killed the day before Halloween and their wedding by a gang that burns buildings on what they like to call 'Devil's Night'. Eric Draven has some unfinished business and comes to life one year later to seek his revenge. It is a dark classic. There is no other movie like it. The dreary setting and the hopeful plot makes you want to watch it over and over again.
B00008OLYN|1.0|This CD should have come with a warning label - &quot;Artist went on a creative sojourn for this offering - buy at your own peril because it's really not very good and we're sorry.&quot;<br />I've seen the reviews that say these guys are so versatile and that they're paying homage to blah, blah, blah.  Maybe Rob Halford's next CD could explore the depths of Ronnie Milsap's influence on, uh well, nevermind.
B00005JKCH|5.0|This is a wonderful movie that is true to its comic book. It has followed the boundaries that were made for it. Tobey Maguire did a wonderful job as the one, the only, Spider-man! This is a movie that can hit close to home at some parts. It has so much eye candy that makes you want to watch it over and over again. The special effects were wonderful! I recommend this movie, although the plot isn't as profound or have as many hidden meanings as other movies, it's still a great find.
B00006J3T4|5.0|I thought with Mark Knopfler's release \\"Sailing to Philadelphia\\" he had made it back to the top, but \\"Ragpicker's Dream\\" makes sure there is no doubt where Knopfler sits. This album is a mixture of country blues, rock and other flavors of music to provide a toe-tapping good time. The guitar work from Knopfler is excellent as expected. The songs span a range of genres, even hinting a little at the Dire Straits days, and funny at times.<br />The album kicks off with the upbeat \\"Why Aye Man\\". The song rips as Knopfler jumps into several cool solos, and changes tempos throughout to keep the song interesting. Not bad for a pumped up English ditty. \\"Quality Shoe\\" is a great marketing pitch for a pair of good shoes. People have sung about everything, and now that includes shoes. The lyrics don't seem that far off, and the guitar and piano solo in the middle are classic. Knopfler gets a good sound for \\"Hill Farmer's Blues\\" that is reminiscent of the Straits' days. The music has an aerial sound to it, and his solo buzzes. \\"Fare There Well Northumberland\\" has a good country-blues feel to it, and Knopfler steps up with another great solo that sounds good over the tinny rhythm guitar, piano and harmonica.<br />Whether you love him or not, Knopfler has outdone himself with this album. Knopfler did a good job with the album, and it has a little something for everyone, especially guitar.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I've never been stoned or drunk in my life, but from what I've seen of others, the feeling cannot be entirely dissimilar to a viewing of Spirited Away.<br />This is a work of purest and brilliant imagination. A Yellow Submarine with Pinnochio-quality animation.<br />I won't attempt to describe the plot - it's like trying to describe a dream that you can't quite remember. Suffice it to say that this film doesn't have SOMEthing for the entire family, it is a film that young children, teens, and adults can all FULLY enjoy without embarassment or self-conscience. A perfectly realized other-world saga on the level of Lord of the Rings, but without the gore.<br />The new century is but a few years old, but this will probably be in the &quot;Best of the Century&quot; when they start compiling such lists 90 years hence. This is the Wizard of Oz for the third millennium.
B0000640VN|2.0|This is one of those pieces of film reviled by males the world over: A MEG RYAN ROMANTIC COMEDY. E[...]<BR>KATE AND LEOPOLD sees Ryan playing herself as usual, but cleverly cast as an advertising executive in present day. Meanwhile in the 19th century a Duke named Leopold (Hugh Jackman) stumbles across a portal that brings him into the 21st Century. Obviously, given the title, their paths cross and despite the 200 year time space, they fall in love; as always happens in a Meg Ryan movie.<BR>Jackman was good as usual, and I kept wondering why he wasted his time with this fluff. Meg Ryan on the other hand, is Meg Ryan; so she just basically stands around with her hair all mussed up looking cute for the entire movie. I kept expecting a little old lady to walk on in every other scene and pinch her cheek and make baby noises about what a cutesy-wutesy she is. Yes, she izzy wizzy.<BR>DVD extras include a choice of viewing either the original cut or Director's Cut of the movie, an On Set feature, deleted scenes, director's commentary, photo gallery, a feature about the costume design and a Sting music video. If you're a woman, you'll probably love KATE AND LEOPOLD, but guys should steer clear. ...
0792164903|5.0|What a wonderful take on the old chestnut. Tim Burton has a vision that is undeniably eclectic and strange. Depp is the perfect choice for the only slightly less hapless Ichabod Crane character. Burton weaves the tale perfectly, leading Depp down a giddily frightening sequence of increasingly wild events culminating in a satisfying and mind-blowing climax. Dark, scary, humorous, an eccentric, fun take. Washington Irving would enjoy it immensely, I think.
B000002B2X|4.0|Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell... In fact, these guys are worth being respected enough about their voice and technique alone. But, they also have genius to make songs with their souls in. Like Jar of Flies EP, this EP is focused on their calm and sentimental side. The 1st track, Brother, has some oriental melodies. So it attracks us into SAP world. The next track, Got Me Wrong, is a great song. Three chord riff in the opening is so impressive, but chord change in chorus part is still far more. And they made great vocal harmonies here \\"like they always do.\\"  Right Turn and Am I Inside? are more subtle tracks. Exeptional Cameos here are incredible, and vocal jam fade-out makes chaos of blue. In my opinion, this band can never be defined in boundaries of so called grunge. A lot of great songs they made showcases their uncommon talents. They have been respected highly by many people, but they are still underrated. They are out of grunge. THEY ARE REAL GENIUS IN WHOLE MUSIC SCENE OF THE 90'S.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I hate musicals I hated Moulin Rouge and I thought this would be bad too , It was really actually great! A fantastic movie with fantastic performances and some truly wonderful music I was so happy I went , Chicago for me became my favorite film of 2002.
B0000931OG|5.0|Parklife is the loveliest album to me.<BR>As Damon says, Think Tank is the best album since Parklife released. I think this album make us think of something or other. (...oh,so title seems to be Think Tank... hee)<BR>Certainly there seems to be no their wit any more.<BR>But if you listen to the second track 'Out of time', track7 'Caravan', track11 'Jets', you will see how blur challenged the music or the world.<BR>and... they succeeded.<BR>In this album,I like 'Gene by Gene'.<BR>Besides the last track 'Battery in your leg' played with Graham is so sad. I expect Graham Coxon to come.<BR>Anyway thanks for this music and...<BR> wholeheartedly thank you, blur!!!
B00006M183|5.0|Pearl Jam has done it again.  Riot Act is full of tunes that make you think as much as they rock out.  <br />My favorites are Save You, Love Boat Captain, Cropduster, I am Mine, Thumbing My Way, Green Disease...even the controversial Bu$hleauger is good.<br />If you've liked their past 3 albums, you'll like this one too.
B00004XOWM|3.0|OK; I'll admit it. I like Limp Bizkit, and all their albums have at least 5 good songs (excluding the truly bad \\"New Old Songs\\"), and it makes me sick how people act like they hate this band. I've written a review already for this album, before I realized that I was being the poser for DISliking this band. But then I listened to the album again after a long time, and though some songs suck, a lot are actually pretty good. Now, what I meant by the \\"poser\\" thing is that a few years ago, someone must have been really bored and just chose a random band to hate. Limp Bizkit must have been their choice. The hate spread, and now, despite the fact that almost everyone in America owns one of their albums, almost everyone in America hates them. It's just the thing to do. They say people who have enough balls to admit they like them are posers and think that they're heavy, where as it's th other way around. These days, people \\"hate\\" this band to act like they're heavy, whereas I'm sure they have a Limp Bizkit CD in their room. Yes, I realize the guitar is bad and unoriginal, but hardly any band can find way to be original anymore. But look on the bright side: they have a new guitarist, and for all we know they'll add guitar solos (probably not though). And the bass is good, and the drums are OK, and the turntables can be disposed of, but for what they are, I guess they're good. Now, I'm not taking up for them because I like rap...I HATE IT. But this is rap/rock. However much you wish to deny it, there is rock on here, and you know, because you have it...
B00008GKEG|5.0|The Beatles Anthology DVD set chronicles The Beatles from the very beginning.  Episode 1 is almost entirely devoted to the births of John, Paul, George, and Ringo, early influences and early performances before they became international stars.  The set offers rare concert footage and television appearances as well as promotional clips for songs such as &quot;Rain,&quot; &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever,&quot; and &quot;Penny Lane.&quot;  The Beatles along with producer George Martin recall how they wrote and recorded the songs that are loved by people all over the world.  Now with a special features disc for the DVD set, the entire Anthology lasts just over 11 hours.  If you didn't buy it the first time on VHS, the price has been cut in half and you get 80 minutes that weren't on the original set, including the &quot;Real Love&quot; video.  And if you think those tapes recorded off of the original TV broadcast is good enough, you haven't seen anything yet!  Buy this set, newly remixed for Dolby 5.1 and DTS!  This is a must have for any Beatle fan!
B00000IBRI|3.0|Disgusting, disturbing, revolting black tale of evil, with brilliant Jennifer Connelly starring as Jennifer, an American girl moving to a Germany college previously known as Wagner's house. A sadic headmistress and a bunch of evil schoolmates are nothing if compared to the raging killer that terrorizes the sorroundings, tortures young girls and collects their corpses in a perverted sense of evil that goes over human rationality. Just like a modern Snowwhite, Jennifer is to survive over a spelled forest where nothing is what it seems, to rise back from her ashes after a disgusting bath. Animals are the real protagonist, without which poor Jennifer would have been bound to fall into an infinite darkness...<br />Another juicy DVD from Anchor bay Ent., with widescreen presentation (1.66:1), English audio track in DS 5.1 and French in mono (what ever happened to Italian?). Interesting audio commentary by Argento, special make up effects artist Sergio Stivaletti, music composer Claudio Simonetti and Journalist Loris Curci, though Tenebre's was something better. Rich extra features, with a theatrical trailer, a behind-the-scene segment, two music videos and Dario Argento interviewed by Joe Franklin.<br />Overall, a very good product, where a little disappointment given by a weak ending is forgiven by an effective extra packet.
B0000542D2|4.0|The Beatles \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" DVD set is a must have for all Beatles fans if you don't already have this movie on a previous DVD release.  The movie itself is excellent.  Although I'm American and I don't get all of the British humor (plus the fact that I wasn't around in the 60's), I find it very funny anyway.  It's a good mix of comedy and music.  <br />I think A Hard Day's Night is the most underrated Beatles album.  It's the first Beatles album of completely Lennon/McCartney originals, and I think it's a turning point in the progress of the quality of their songs.  <br />Some of the songs are at the wrong speed and key, which is annoying.  I wish that would have been fixed, but that's ok.  The sound is some kind of fake stereo/5.1 mix.  A true stereo mix would have been excellent.  These are the biggest let downs of this DVD set.<br />The bonus disc is interesting at times, but quite boring at others.  It's an in depth look at the producers, directors, and actors.  I'm a Beatles fan, so not everything on this disc is enjoyable to me.  However, there's a lot of good information about the movie to be found there.  I think George Martin's thoughts on each song from the soundtrack are the most intersting to me. <br />I don't think it's a great DVD set as far as what DVD can do and special features, but the movie itself carries the set to 4 out of 5 stars.  If you've never seen this movie, but enjoy the Beatles' music, you should at least see this movie.  It's very enjoyable to me and I think most Beatle fans would like it.
6305807930|3.0|Good stylish Argento movie dating back to 1980. Yet something wrong. Maybe the plot, too close to that of 1976 Suspiria, of which Inferno is probably an ideal sequel, but not as whipping and fascinating. The academy school has been replaced by a groomy building, nest of Mater Tenebrarum, one of the three Mothers who rule the world. The impression is that something is missing, probably the final part of the mothers trilogy, which began with Mother Suspiriorum in 1976. Superb cinematography and juicy episodes, such as the cellar immersion of the protagonist or the double gore murder of Eleonora Giorgi and Gabriele Lavia, whose screams mix up with Verdi's Nabucco. I expected something better from the solution of it all, but your nerves will be whipped from the very beginning up to the whole development of the movie.<BR>Good job from Anchor Bay Ent., with a widescreen presentation (1.85:1) enhanced for 16x9 TV's, the audio track is only in english language, but in 5.1 Dolby Sorround. The extra features are essential, with an exclusive Dario Argento interview (which begins before the film starts, but cannot be selected from the menu), the theatrical trailer, a still gallery and the talent bios. Good exercise of tension with a great score from Keith Emerson, excellent style and fascinating colours.
0385504209|4.0|In the wake of the DaVinchi Code, the novel which continues to persistently sell like hotcakes, there's another take on the subject of the holy grail-- a non-fiction book called Miracle of the Ark that serendipitously uses quite a few of the same novel tactics to connect the dots but instead applies them to actual events, which produces different results and reaches alternative conclusions-- that deserves a look for balance sake.  In like manner as the bestseller that is all the rage, this other treatment artistically arrives at answers which make logical sense and that are highly suggestive of the present abode of the real relict by reaching further back in time than Leonardo DaVinci to sources of the Middle Ages to show that the theory put forth is symbolically solid. Similar to the cipher found by the body that sets the stage in the murder mystery, in this case the lynchpin of the argument granting insight to pinpoint the possible location of the grail like a bull's-eye target revolves around a key etching drawn on the face of an oil lamp that was found hidden within the capital punishment grounds where blood was initially drawn for that sacred vessel that has vanished without a trace.<br />  What the oil lamp likely meant would not be solved until now, millennia after the clue was planted at the execution site during the Babylonian siege when, not so coincidentally, the Ark of the Covenant also simultaneously went missing into tunnels in the turmoil and looting in an interesting historical parallel to today.<br />  All was quiet on the grail front up to the time it became topical.  Then, as if in poetic justice, in the inverse of the earlier invasion, when instead of waxing the tide has turned and regime of Iraq recedes after the war, a lead surfaces in a medieval manuscript's illumination that unlocks the counterintuitive mystery of the symbol on the lamp, which had previously been dismissed as irrelevant, much like the Biblical artifacts coming to the fore of late such as the ossuary burial box that remained in deep storage of antiquities dealers until the significance of the inscription James was realized.<br />  In the final analysis, when the riddle inside an enigma wrapped in swaddling clothes was figured out, in a surprise, unexpected ending, the grail and the Ark are synonymous, one and the same receptacle, teaching an old dogma new tricks.ore of late such as the ossuary burial box that remained in deep storage of antiquities dealers until the significance of the inscription James was realized.<br />     In the final analysis, when the riddle inside an enigma wrapped in swaddling clothes was figured out, in a surprise, unexpected ending, the grail and the Ark are synonymous, one and the same receptacle, teaching an old dogma new tricks.

B00006JJ1O|5.0|I usually listen to more headbanger type stuff, but I was bored and turned on the radio to the pop music station. It was about 2 days before &quot;200 Km/H in the Wrong Lane&quot; came out. I heard &quot;All The Things She Said&quot; once. I was hooked and went out and bought the album a few days later. I'm the kind of person who usually listens to at least two songs from a CD before I buy it, so I was a little nervous that I might be getting an album with one good song, but that wasn't the case. The whole CD was excellent. The lyrics are catchy, but not so to be annoying, and I especially can relate to them. I even went out and bought the imported Russian album, which (even though I don't understand that much Russian) was just as, if not more, amazing. If you haven't gotten this CD yet, you should.
B000002UAU|5.0|I've encountered several venerable &quot;best albums of all time&quot; lists that have &quot;Sgt. Pepper...&quot; as #1, and have to agree with this. I would hope that a critique is a personal thing, not a consensus of the masses, and for me, when released, the album was mystical, from the album cover design to the stream of consciousness that pervades the music, and continues to this day. References to getting up in the morning (&quot;Day in the Life&quot;, the delicious &quot;Good Morning...&quot;), allusions to people and events encountered during the day (&quot;Lovely Rita&quot;) and the pervasive dream-like references that are too numerous to mention, are to me, glimpses into a time that is unique, and brought (back) into life in the form of this recording. Universal messages are melodically represented &quot;Within You...&quot; that to me, have no equal. Technically flawness and fun, this one still remains fresh.
B000084T18|5.0|I like this album it's great.  I'm 10 years old and I love this album.  All of the beats are really great and the lyrics are really great and 50 cents is a really good rappper and I just love this cd cause it's so good.  This is what rap music is all about, really good beats and really good lyrics and really good rapping.  50 cents is the best rapper ever, I listen to this cd every day after school while I'm eating my snack pack and watching Sister Sister on the WB.  It's good my mom bought it for me for my birthday along with Justin Timberlake's new cd.  That's great too I love both cd's but 50 cents is especially good.
0385504209|3.0|This book started out with an interesting premise that seemed to be building up to something but then didn't.  &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; was engaging and a little bit addictive--for my desire to drag myself through the writing to find out what happened, not for its literary value.  I found that it was a little hypocritical that although an idea of the story was the suppression of the &quot;divine feminine&quot; in society, the female protagonist was still portrayed as needing a male protector and at the end, the interesting tension between the two melted down to a simplistic let's-give-the-readers-what-they-want romance.  The way that Brown worked his research into the story seemed chunky and forced, and his techniques for keeping readers in suspense were quite crude.  Still, this book brings up a few interesting ideas and manages to hold your interest...just put the jacket from some other novel on it if you're somewhere with a lot of intelligent people.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Very talented singer.  Her range and style of music is amazing.  I'm 44 years old, and her CD is played on a regular occasion.  Her voice is velvet.  You will not be dissapointed with this cd, as she has the guts to vary from the norm on her songs.  She has the soul for a blues player.  I hope to hear more from her as she matures!  Keep it going PINK!
B000022TSW|5.0|One of the finest Hollywood films of the last five years.  It is intelligent, well written, beautifully made and laugh out loud funny.  It is also that rarest of things: a musical with a good memorable score that actually has a brain in its head.  <br />Make no mistake: South Park Bigger Longer and Uncut is one of the most devastating critiques of contemporary American life that we are likely to get from the movies.  No one is spared.  If you look closely, I'm sure you'll find yourself in there somewhere.<br />A terrific movie.  Fast, funny, and even oddly moving.  See it.
B000002B7O|5.0|Randy at his best. Rest in peace m8! You've inspired my forever!
0385504209|4.0|Hey Folks,<br />This one is just fun. Not even done yet and I'll recommend it. Yes its fiction but it does make you think about alot more than just the plot. The plot itself is straight-forward fare and it works well enough to keep things moving, it's thriller afterall. I have fun doing some research on the topics that make up the historical background to the story and when a book gets me learning new things while enjoying a good read well, I recommend it. So check it out and enjoy
0451167716|5.0|I read this book in 2 days. It's wonderful to read it and watch the movie again. It describes the characters more and gives you insight into some of the characters whose names are not revealed in the movie. It also adds more plot lines. This is a MUST read for anyone who likes Mafia and crime books.
B00005QDW5|4.0|This collection contains music from all eras of Pink Floyd. From the sixties when Syd Barret was Floyd's front man until the late eighties and early nineties when Roger Waters was no longer a part of the group. I am disappointed about some of the song selection on this album. There is too much Barret era music and great songs such as \\"Run like hell\\" and \\"Young Lust\\" were left off of the album. This album is a must for big Floyd fans because it contains the song \\"When the Tigers Broke Free.\\" This song is in the movie \\"The Wall,\\" but it is not on the album \\"The Wall.\\" For someone who is  not familiar with Floyd music ,I would suggest to purchase this CD first and sample the music. However, no compilation of Floyd music is as good as the album themselves.
0451526384|5.0|Many would have Austen's &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; determine her status as one of the greatest of all novelists; however, this critic will always stand by the quiet and profound maturity that defines this lovely masterpiece &quot;Persuasion.&quot; Here the characters are all terribly human and flawed and the narrative so touching without ever resorting to maudlin prose. There is an underlying sadness in this book which tells the reader that at some point in her life, Jane Austen loved deeply. This book is a celebration of that love; indeed, she would not have felt comfortable mourning it before her family or her readers. Therefore, instead of indulging in self-pity, Austen gratifies the soul by telling the story of one woman who refuses to sacrife her integrity and &quot;secures&quot; the man she loves in her way and in her time. This is more than a great read; it is truly a magnificent work.
0385493622|5.0|I found this book on the bookshelves of friends I visited for a few days. I was so taken by the book that I managed to finish it before leaving (cutting on my hours of sleep), and then bought a copy to peruse again. A fascinating tale, combining masterful storytelling with a brilliant yet accessible history of mathematic discoveries. Pure joy.
B00005LQ04|3.0|I thought this movie was a big letdown after I had read so many reviews on it.  I went out and bought it about the the The Ring came out.  I bought both of these movies because they were both built up to be these real scary movies, but I did not see that.  Suspiria was really a bore and I did not even find very much suspense in it.
B00006BTCA|2.0|OK, so the lyrics are decent (note:decent, not good), but everything else about this band is just pathetic. Granted, they've got a few more influences than just Joy Division, but there's absolutely nothing special about Interpol.  Their arrangements aren't the least bit inventive, their rhythm section, while astoundingly tight, don't offer anything beyond the steady tumble cycle of a washing machine.  It's too late guys, Sigur Ros already cornered the market on drenching guitars in [a lot] of reverb. and they had the sense to use a bow, ghostly keys, and GOOD SONGS. That's right, Interpol's greatest weakness is their complete lack of a good song. Indie fans need to wake up and realize that slow and dreamy doesn't necessarily equal good. Some dreams are scary, some are exciting. Interpol's are mundane. I'm increasingly convinced that people only like this band so people will think they're sophisticated. Trust me, it's boring music.
B00008NG5V|5.0|I am a huge fan of brushfire fairytales and i think this album is even better. This album seems to have its own groove and the songs meld together a bit better than the first album. (Fav Songs: Times Like These, Cookie Jar, Rodeo Clowns)
B00006CXXU|5.0|Many people have been complaining about Christina's fashion sense, (I mean I don't like her style either), but fashion has nothing to do with her singing talent. This is one of the few album's I own, where I don't have to skip any of the songs.<br />1. Stripped Intro - 9/10 Features people including Fred Durst at the begining talking about her, then she starts to sing. It is short but a very good intro.<br />2. Can't Hold Us Down - 9.5/10 Would have given it 10, but there are other tracks I like a little better. Lil' Kim is featured in this track. It is very catchy.<br />3. Walk Away - 10/10 This is about smeone who can't walk away from a bad relationship, it's powerful and moving. The chorus is great.<br />4. Fighter - 10/10 Christina's third single is basicly the second part of \\"walk away\\". Where after walking away from the relationship, she thanks the guy for making her stronger. This is one of my favorites.<br />5. Primer Amar Interlude - 9/10 Although I can't understand everything she says in this interlude, (because it's spoken in spanish) it's still good.<br />6. Infatuation- 9.5/10 Very catchy, this should probably become one of her singles.<br />7. Loves Embrace Interlude - 9/10 A perfect interlude to get us into the next song.<br />8. Loving Me 4 Me - 9.8/10 Pretty much perfect, it is a beautiful song about loving someone for who they really are. Great melody.<br />9. Impossible - 9.2/10 I think the reason I don't like this as much as others is because their are not as many lryics, and pure emotion as there are in other songs, don't get me wrong I still love it, and think it's an amazing song. Sung beautifully by Christina. Alica Keys worke on this song.<br />10. Underappreciated - 9.1/10 Once again this song is catchy. My favorite part is the chorus.<br />11. Beautiful - 9.8/10 A beautiful song. Her second single. I actually like this song more and more, everytime I listen to it.<br />12. Make Over - 9.5/10 This song has more of a rock vibe. And it's a great song because of it.<br />13. Cruz - 9.5/10 Another beautiful Christina song, Even though it's got  short chorus, it is still a great one.<br />14. Soar - 10/10 One of my favorites, a powerful piece about beinging who you really are.<br />15. Get Mine. Get Yours - 9.8 Great beat, and catchy chorus, Although, the song talks about wanting to just have casual sex, and no real relationship, which may bother some people.<br />16. Dirrty- 10/10 Christina's first single, is still as great as it was the first time I heard it.<br />17. Stripped part 2- 9/10 She continues from where she felt off in Stripped intro. Short, but again good.<br />18. The Voice Within - 9.5 Another powerful song, she sings it well!<br />19. I'm Ok - 9.8/10 This is about her father, it was recorded with Christina lying on her back, on the floor, in just one take. It's wonderful.<br />20. Keep on Singing My Song - 9.5 A great track to end the album with. I hope Christina does continue to sing her songs.<br />Even if you don't really like Christina as a person, you should get this, every track is incredible.
B00008S2VG|2.0|No female artist in popular music has reinvented her sound more than Madonna.  More often that not this approach works--unfortunately, AMERICAN LIFE is that rare instance in which it doesn't.  Working again with MUSIC collaborator Mirwais, Madonna abandons the dance floor(for the most part)in favor of being electronica's answer to Sheryl Crow.  On occasion, this hybrid theory works, at least when she concentrates on the melody, as on \\"Hollywood\\" and \\"Nothing Fails\\".  But when she relies on lyrical content in favor of musical content, she fails miserably--\\"I'm Stupid\\", \\"Easy Ride\\", and \\"X-Static Process\\" are simply awful songs, with lyrically challenged verses and minimalist production--for the first time ever, Madonna actually sounds BORING.  And in this context, \\"Die Another Day\\"(which, as a Bond theme, is a failure, but as a straight up dance record is first-rate)seems glaringly out of place--even the title track, with an almost unforgivable rap that smacks of the worst aspects of  J.Lo's equally boastful 'Jenny From the Block\\", doesn't jibe with her new \\"loathing\\" of all things material.  All in all, though occasionally interesting, this outranks even EROTICA as Madonna's worst effort to date.
B000063JDE|3.0|I just purchased this movie from amazon and just got done watching it and this is definetly no masterpiece like the reviews on hear that i read. It is definetly bizarre and stupid at times like the reviews say but this is nothing great.i found alot of parts of the movie to be boring and dragged on n on.I love films that are controversial and bizarre at times but this movie was just out there, not in a good way either in a boring stupid crazy way. It just wasnt good. I admit the charachters did a great job portraying a bunch of insane people and played thier roles well but i just didnt think the story was that great. I gave it 3 stars cause it had somthing going for it but basically it was boring and that annoying blue velvet song i couldnt wait for the movie to end- oh yea and to the reviewer who said ( people dont get the film or understand it) - i understood it and it was still boring and the story nothing knew or great. I dont know what all the hype behind this movie is about- all it was was a wierd mystery story with insane characters who i felt no sympathy for at all and i didnt enjoy watching them either-they didnt interest me at all only the kyle macglachlan character.my opinion is either skip it or just rent it or see it once then decide.
B000083E79|5.0|It's now 2003, and you know what that means--time for yet another compilation from pop's longest-lasting diva.  Fortunately, THE VERY BEST OF CHER manages to correct alot of the omissions that have occurred on previous stateside compilations.  It goes without saying that the usual suspects are here--'Believe', 'If I Could Turn Back Time', 'Half Breed', et al.  What's doubly nice here is the inclusion of moderate hits('Heart Of Stone'), as well as down-rights flops(the fantastic 'All Or Nothing', 'Save Up All Your Tears'), and the exclusion of some hits that just weren't very good records('We All Sleep Alone', 'Love And Understanding' and yes, 'The Way Of Love').  There are a few minor quibbles--the remix of 'One By One' isn't nearly as good as the far superior UK album version(or even the US album version), and the original version of 'A Different Kind Of Love Song' would also have been a better choice here.  Otherwise, this stands as Cher's best compilation released stateside.
0920668372|5.0|This book is not creepy or odd at all.  When I read it, I think of the love my Mom and Dad had for me and their unconditional love for me until the day my Dad passed away.  As I read it to my children, they snuggle up to me and understand my tears are of 'complete happiness'.  The book represents love and traditions that are passed down from generation to generation.   To be loved and give the gift of love is one of God's greatest gifts.  ENJOY!
B00008NG5V|5.0|This album is much better than Brushfire Fairytales.  I think he has settled into a warm-weather, feel-good style of playing.  His guitar-playing has gotten better as well.  <br />&quot;On and on&quot; is perfect for those hot summer days, or perhaps a drive to the beach.  Songs are simple and pleasurable.  They put you in a good mood.  <br />Jack Johnson is not out to change the world with his music.  Not a bad thing considering the recent wave of singer/songwriters entering the spotlight (John Mayer, Howie Day, Jason Mraz, &amp; Ben Kweller).  Among these new artists, I believe that Jack actually fits in quite nicely while maintaining a style all his own.
B00008AY3L|5.0|Ben Harper is amazing - this new album just proves how diverse and creative a songwriter he is.  Brown Eyed Blues is a bounce around the house tune, Diamonds on the Inside is great and I'm sure everyone has heard With My Own Two Hands on the radio.  There isn't a miss on the entire album.
B00008NRI8|5.0|Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock share a chemistry which is witty, believable and funny. If you are a lover of chick flicks, be sure to get this one!<br />The one-liners are hilarious and you will leave this movie with a smile on your face and a tear on your cheek.<br />GREAT music too!!!
B00008NRI7|4.0|Okay, so you knew how the story would end at the beginning, but isn't that true of all romantic comedies?  If you like the genre, you accept that the storyline is predictable but that seems to be what the &quot;artistic&quot; movie critics abhor.  I enjoyed this movie.  I enjoyed Sandra's quirky antics and Hugh's self-centered blindness.  But I also enjoyed &quot;French Kiss&quot; and &quot;Kate and Leopold.&quot;  Is this the absolute best romantic comedy out there?  No.  But does it provide 70-80 minutes of escapism?  Yes.
B000001DTM|5.0|You might call this the greatest U2 album that almost never was.  In 1990 the band was at a crossroads, having just come off the mega-success of \\"The Joshua Tree\\" album/tour and the subsequent release of \\"Rattle and Hum.\\"  As the band congregated in Berlin to commence the writing/recording process, Bono and the Edge were getting more into the club scene and dance music while Larry and Adam were still into the traditional rock sound.  These differences muddled the creative process and threatened to permanently undo the greatest band of the 80's.<br />Then one day Edge walks into the studio playing a certain riff from what would eventually be the song \\"One\\" and the rest is music history.  From the opening buzz guitar and distorted vocals of \\"Zoo Station\\" to the utterly danceable \\"Mysterious Ways\\" this was clearly a band reinventing themselves to save themselves.  Sonically it is a blending of straight ahead rock, industrial and dance music.  Lyrically there was a lessening of the political ideology but no less of the Christian mythology found in previous albums, making it clear that Bono was ready to tone down the preachiness and hubris of \\"Rattle and Hum.\\"<br />I was initially turned off by the radical new sound of this album as it was such a departure from the U2 I had known to that point.  As usual, the band's sound was one step ahead of my taste and I listen to the album more today then I ever did when it was first released.  To say it has grown on me would be an understatement.  From beginning to end it is an absolute masterpiece and will always hold a special place in my heart as the album that helped save U2.
078322804X|5.0|This movie stands alone as one the greatest of all time.  Timeless music, legendary musicians, and drop dead humor occupy every second of this fabulous movie!  I've seen this movie 54 times, and I am still nowhere close to being sick of it.  The only thing that bothers me is that such a horrible sequel followed it!  Let's all pretend that doesn't exist, and just let this masterpiece stand alone.
B00005JL3A|5.0|This was a movie that would definitely get and hold your attention. A group of commando type people go underground to an <BR>installation called the hive.

Watch this movie.
B000002KLQ|4.0|In the years between their wonderful debut album in 1979 and their triumphant masterpiece 'Brothers In Arms' in 1986, Dire Straits reocrds always seem to juxtapose moments of sheer brilliance and amazing energy with forgettable little one-listen country rock tunes, and 'Making Movies' is no exception. Of the album's mere seven tracks, the majority of the songs - Expresso Love, Hand In Hand, Solid Rock and - yes, I dare say it - Romeo And Juliet - are really nothing to write home about. Sure, they're good tunes all right - Romeo & Juliet is a very pretty ballad, and Solid Rock is a cool song for stage performances - and, of course, Mark Knopfler's always exquisite guitar makes every one of them a treat to the ears. But they're simply nothing special, and won't keep you interested for very long. The video for Romeo & Juliet is actually more interesting than the song itself.<br />Fortunately, 'Making Movies' is saved by several strokes of genius that make the whole thing worth the price. My favorite is the closing track, Les Boys, a deliciously naughty little tune with hilerious lyrics like only Knopfler could write and a great delivery. Skateaway is another personal favorite of mine. It has drummer Pick Withers in his exquisite best. Finally, of course there's the epic and extremely enrgetic Tunnel Of Love - which remains one of Mark's finest moments and, together with Telegraph Road and Brothers In Arms, makes for one of his most complex, intelligent and compelling compositions. Instrumental work is great from all parts (WONDERFUL keyboard by Roy Bittan from Springsteen's E Street Band!) and Mark finishes with a beautiful slow guitar solo, one of his best performances.<br />'Making Movies' is certainly not essential, but it's a terrific album, and one of their best. On 'Communique' Knopfler seems baffled by his sudden success and confused with his new expensive production; on 'Making Movies' he takes over the production for the first time and that makes all the difference - their sound is better than it ever was before. By 1980 Mark is once again confident - He knows exactly what he's doing and where he's going. And even though this CD is not likely to become a regular resident in your CD player, it's always a fun listen. If you own and love 'Brothers In Arms' and 'Dire Straits', get this one next.
B000069AUI|3.0|Everybody seems to be comparing Coldplay to Radiohead because... well, why? Because theyre both British and use pianos? (Radiohead only occasionally) i guess that must be why. Anybody familiar with The Doves knows that they are pretty much the big brother of Coldplay, whereas Radiohead is more like a 2nd cousin or something. The Doves also have only 2 major albums out but have been around longer and i think are a more diverse, interesting band, although they dont have as many stand outs as coldplay does. In fact, &quot;clocks&quot;, the reason most people probably will buy this album, is probably the best typical british rock ballad ive ever heard. My main gripe with Coldplay is the lyrics, which glorify being codependent on other people for love &quot;well you want me to change, well ill change for you, and i want you to know that youll always get your way&quot; (what the hell?!). The lyrics aren't very challenging or interesting, but the main pull of Coldplay will always be the melodies, which are always very nice to listen to and carry a lot of emotion. I don't really see how theyve progressed much since Parachutes, which is another reason not to compare them to radiohead, but oh well. Anyway, what i really mean to say is that if you're a fan of Coldplay check out The Doves sometime, particularly their older album. theyre both great.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Hybrid Theory has and is one of my favorite cd's ever. It is so jam packed with awesome riffs, vocals, techniques, mixes, and even just the lyrics blew me away. Reanimation...I dont even wanna talk about it. And now the long-awaited Meteora. Now, dont get me wrong, this is an awesome album, it just...duznt live up to Hybrid Theory. But I am still very pleased with it, and I think that Linkin Park fans everywhere will be also. My favorite songs are: Numb, Lying From You, Faint, and Figure.09. solid and amazing album!
B00005JLRT|3.0|I'm much more of a fan of the original crew than I ever was of the Next Generation, whom I've always felt were a little bland. I don't know if this is the last Generation movie or not -if it is, they certainly couldn't have done a more haphazard job of tying things up.  Troi and Riker's wedding comes out of left field (wasn't there a hint at something between her and Worf developing at one time?), poor Wesley looks like he was George Lucased into the wedding party, and isn't Worf a diplomat at this point and no longer a part of the Enterprise crew?  The Data plot is undercut by the existence of B-4.  Sure it was sad, but the drama is lessened because you know he'll be back in a sequel - in short, we've seen this already, in the far superior Star Trek II.<br />The one standout in this movie is Shinzon.  Hardy has got to be the most charismatic actor to appear as a villain in a Trek film since the sorely underused Malcom McDowell in Generations, and is nearly on par with the incomparable Ricardo Montalban as Khan.  He dominates every scene he appears in, even giving Patrick Stewart (who has always been the most honed actor on TNG) a run for his money.  The anti-chemistry between them crackles.  Despite his twerpish frame, something in Shinzon's scarred face and smoldering eyes sets him apart as very very dangerous.  His costume design is perfect as well - garbed in satantic black armor, he is every bit the Modred to Stewart's Arthur (note the climactic ... struggle -clearly a nod to Le Morte D'Arthur, but again, those Hollywood producers are too cowardly to let Picard [pass away]).  <br />The space battle is great (and I really like the `telepathic sonar' concept with Troi - why didn't they ever have her do that before - it was really cool!), but FX are never enough to carry a film.  This movie is worth seeing mainly for Tom Hardy as Shinzon.  He plays the role with a ferocious intensity and underplayed criminal charm that is just riveting.  The man is a fantasticallytalented actor, and I hope to see more of him.<br />Look carefully for Ron Perlman as the Reman second in command.  Yet another underutilized talent buried in latex.
6304056818|5.0|As is well known, this is a Sci-fi film loosely based on Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST meeting Freud's theories of the Id.  But this would count for nothing if the film weren't so extremely well done in other ways.<br />Although not working with an especially large budget, the makers of the film combined a good story with amazingly innovative set design and clever special effects to produce what is possibly the most satisfying film set in outer space film made during the 1950s.  Shot entirely on a soundstage, the exterior shots of the planet manage to avoid looking at all hokey, and the house in which Dr. Morbius and his daughter Altaira live, despite looking pure 1950s, manages to somehow seem right at home.  The shots of the interior of the former inhabitants' magnificent structures are some of the best model shots in film history.  Even with today's special effects and CGI scripting, they are impressive.  And Robby the Robot has to go down as one of the great screen robots of all time.  Also among the all time greats, the invisible but nonetheless detectable \\"monster from the ID\\" is one of the most satisfying monsters one could imagine.  Almost all movie monsters from the fifties disappoint, at seem to some degree a bit silly, but not this one.<br />Part of the reason the movie works so well is the cast, which is a cut above average for a fifties Sci-fi flick.  Leslie Nielsen was thirty years away from his debut as a comedian, and plays what was his usual character for the first half of his film career:  a solid if a bit too serious lead.  Walter Pidgeon turns in the strongest performance in the film, as the brilliant Dr. Morbius.  His voice alone makes many of the key scenes in the film work beautifully.  Anne Francis is simply beautiful, and it doesn't take much imagination the effect she would have on a ship full of men who haven't seen a woman in several months.  She manages to be incredibly sexy and completely innocent as successfully as any actress I have ever seen.<br />One can overstress the Shakespeare and Freud connection, but this film does get my vote for the best use of psychology ever made in a Sci-fi film.  It along with the extreme care given to every aspect of this film make it to this day one of the most durable Sci-fi films ever made.ver seen.<br />One can overstress the Shakespeare and Freud connection, but this film does get my vote for the best use of psychology ever made in a Sci-fi film.

B00005M91K|4.0|I've watched this movie twice so far, both with a different group of friends, whose reactions I noted as being radically different. Some people just couldn't sit there and watch it. They didn't have any logical reasoning to not watch it, but it seemed to touch places in their psyche that they weren't prepared to confront. And this movie confronts various parts of the human psyche, many being very dark.  It is this reason that I think many people just can't watch this movie. But if you are into very symbolic works of art, definately check it out. Maybe even burn a few before-hand... ;)
B00008BXJF|4.0|I was really down on the current KC after the last release (The<br />Construction Of Light)and thought this version was a little tiresome,especially Adrian Belew.Boy what a comeback this one is!!! Like Thrak (only better)TPTB recalls elements of KC music throughout the years in new tunes. The accapella opening title cut which re-occurrs throughout the album is reminiscent of the opening and closing of In The Wake Of Poseidon. There's plenty of reference to the musical approach of Larks Tongues In Aspic, Red, and Discipline, as well as a Fripp solo that recalls the sound of \\"Sailors Tale\\" from Islands.Some would argue that there is too much rehash here, but I welcome it over most of what is being passed off as innovative these days.For all those missing Bill Bruford, you gotta here Pat Mastellotto on this release. This guy smokes!Berlew's lyrics are a huge improvement over TCOL,where he only seemed half interested, and  maybe saving his best for his solo releases.Overall the most satisfying KC in years; truly believe!!!
B00005JKPF|4.0|The X-Men have to unite with the Brotherhood of Mutants to thwart the plans of a rogue, military scientist who wants to obliterate the entire mutant population.<br />1) Same feel as the first movie. Nice mix of action, humor, suspense, and super-power special effects to wet most people's appetite. If you like the first one you won't be disappointed here.<br />2) You've seen it in the trailers, Nightcrawler is AWESOME! The third movie will just need to introduce Beast and the group will be complete.<br />3) Jean Grey's character transforms into something more formidable than the weakling she was in the first movie. I'm very happy for that.<br />4) Mystique seems a LOT more powerful and skilled than in the first movie. Not sure why they did that, but it made me like her character more because she was so resourceful and ingenuitive.<br />5) We find out more about Wolverine's past. Interesting. Hugh Jackman is Wolverine!<br />6) Rogue had her usefulness to the \\"bad guys\\" in the first movie. But both movies are still struggling to show the usefulness of Rogue to the good guys.<br />7) They upped Storm so she isn't so goofy as in the first movie. She too actually comes across useful in this movie.<br />8) Introduced Pyro and some of his motivations which helped sharpen what is to come in future movies.<br />9) Where did they find a 17 year old (not sure if that is his real age) so large to play Colossus?!? Nice cameo of this character making you want to see more of him.<br />OVERALL: As sequels go, this was one was in many ways is a stronger movie than the first movie. It was worth paying the money to go see in the movie theater and I'll definitely get the DVD.
B000089RVX|2.0|I've been listening to this cd for about a week or so and the best thing I can say about it is amy has a great voice. The music is rather boring. There's no memorable riffs or anything and the lyrics are incredibly cliche. Most of the songs sound quite similar to each other to me as well. It's not something that I'll be listening to for the next couple of months that's for sure. I guess it does have a &quot;haunting&quot; sound to it, or whatever, but that type of music is just boring to me.
B000007638|5.0|When reading these reviews, make sure you are reading the 2013 ones for the new re-issue. It can get very confusing because Amazon has kept the reviews for previously released editions.<br /><br />This is an updated review from 6/25/13.
B000089RVX|5.0|I am probably much too old to be listening to this music (50) but this is a fabulous effort.  I haven't heard such heart rendering music with a heavy sound, especially from a woman in a very long time.  This girl's voice is awesome and her band is great too.  The entire cd is great.  I have an extensive collection of workout cd's and believe it or not I can use this for running OR lifting.  It's awesome.  ...FIVE BIG STARS!!!
B000002UB3|5.0|I don't know why there is any debate as to who was the \\"best\\" Beatle.  They ALL made the group a success and they needed each other to bounce ideas off of.<br /><br />This was the boys' last studio effort, recorded after Let It Be but, as we all know, because of personal and business conflicts, this wound up being released BEFORE Let It Be and, strangely, it sounds more together than the latter (even though none of the boys were in the studio together during the making of Abbey because the tension was so high).<br /><br />I was never crazy about the concept of an album where all the songs ran into each other, making it seem like one big song with vastly different parts (Pink Floyd took that concept and really ran with it!) so I gravitate to the more traditional-format songs (a clear beginning and ending) on this album.  I play \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" and love it more each time.  I also enjoy \\"Here Comes The Sun.\\"  There's just something about that song that rocks.<br /><br />I can't say this is a Beatle album worth owning because they're ALL worth owning.
B00005JLWN|5.0|...All I have to say is this ... This movie was allowed to die in the Top 20 test marking cities after only two weeks, with absolutely NO advertising.  Why?  This film is politically-incorrect and centers on many issues (hate-crime laws, war-on-terror, government censorship, absolute government ... etc) that those in `the establishment' would rather you not consider for yourself.  This film was `shelved' for almost a year, then finally released late in 2002 for only a few weeks.  It is very likely that Dimension Films is going to only sell only one run of DVDs and tapes to recoup their losses in production costs.  As this movie was not marketed in any meaningful way, it seems likely that it will vanish as soon as the copies are all sold out...  If you waited to see it in the theaters, you missed it (like I did), if you wait again to add this to your collection you could be in for a long wait before you see it again...  It has within it the elements of several other movies:<BR>All the government of Orwell's \\"1984\\"  <BR>All the censorship of Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451'<BR>All the cinematography of Lang's \\"Metropolis\\"<BR>Along with themes of many other movies including \\"Gattaca\\" and \\"Logan's Run\\"<BR>This film `seems' like so many other near-future totalitarian masterpieces in many ways.  Yet, it remains it's own movie and retains its own plot and twists, without having to ride on anyone's coattails, least of all the \\"Matrix\\".  It is graphic, violent, often shocking, and filled with religious connotations.  The actions sequences are fewer and shorter than those in \\"The Matrix\\".  However, the action in \\"Equilibrium\\" is still superior, partly because it is more controlled, less flashy, and more realistic.  The incredible stunt scenes, done with very little CGI, complement the story in \\"Equilibrium\\" without dominating the entire film.   The fight scenes in \\"The Matrix\\" seem way overdone and excessively gratuitous by comparison.  The quality of Christian Bale's performanceis exceptionally above that of Keanu Reeves (who is still as vacuous as he was in his `Bill and Ted' days).<BR>    <BR>There are a few scenes that may upset some highly sensitive people, such as; the incineration of a living woman named Mary, some soldiers shooting some penned up dogs, and the arrest of John Preston's wife at home in front of her children. After all this is a serious film about brutal government and by no means a `family classic' nor a `chic flick'.  Taye Diggs was the only shortcoming of whole movie as he was `too emotional' for his part in it. <BR>Here is what \\"Equilibrium\\" lacks thankfully) ...<BR>Cheap, easy, pointless and gratuitous sex<BR>Unnecessarily foul and obscene language<BR>A positive view of drugs<BR>Empty humor and meaningless comic relief<BR>A hopelessly depressing ending typical of this kind of movie
B000002UAO|5.0|Rubber Soul is The Beatles at their best and brightest. They started to become more introspective and expand their repertoire beyond the bubble gum pop of their early years.<br /><br />My favorite cut is \\"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown).\\" Supposedly, it's about an extramartial affair of John's but the beautiful use of the sitar and the flow of the lyrics makes you want to sing the song a million times.<br /><br />The music is tight, the boys are truly working together as a group and the effort shows. I simply don't understand some of the lousy reviews for this album when this is the album I will always use to introduce people to the greatest group there ever was or will be.<br /><br />For true Beatles fans, all you need is Rubber Soul and Revolver.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I had reservations about this movie when I first saw it. I hadn't heard a lot about it but it seemed interesting. After ten minutes I loved it and it only got better. The acting is terrific, the plot is highly detailed, the story is intense and captivating, there is nothing good about this movie because it's terrific. You can feel for so many characters and the actions scenes steal the movie hands down. If you are an action, drama, sci-fi, or just intense story fan then this is the movie you should buy because I know I will.
B000002UAR|5.0|I'm truly stuck between this and Rubber Soul as to what one is their best album (I'll only pick Rubber because it didn't rely heavily on studio tricks as much as Revolver).<br /><br />I love the final cut, \\"Tomorrow Never Knows.\\" A fantastic ending to a great album.<br /><br />With Rubber Soul, the boys got deep but with Revolver they got even deeper, more instrospective, and the use of drugs helped fuel that (so what? Everyone else was using drugs to enhance their music).<br /><br />Anyway, I love it when \\"Taxman\\" is broke out every Tax Day, I enjoy \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\" (not your conventional love song, but it still gets the message across), and \\"She Said She Said\\" is one of those classic psychedelic goodies.<br /><br />This and Rubber Soul are Beatles essentials, the boys at their best and deepest.
6303314015|5.0|When I was young, younger (I'm 19 now), I used to watch this movie all the time, well not all the time but I watched it a lot. I think this is one of the best animated film Disney ever created, it's such a great family movie. The songs are great, the charaters are funny and touching... The DVD will be a must have in a DVD collection. Buy this movie, rent it...
B000000YG5|3.0|This CD is way overrated. Truth is Rollins isn't as good as some others like Stan Getz, Paul Desmond, Zoot Sims,  etc. Max Roach'es drum solos are annoying and sound like nothing more than a clumsy effort by an amateur.<br />I'm not saying that all of Rollins' playing is not enjoyable, am simply saying this is not the great jazz album that some  claim to be.<br />If you can get it at a discount, by all means, go for it--otherwise not worth it. Just my opinion.
6302787068|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites of all time. I remember, when I was a kid I watched it a lot and I was always playing with the small characters... These where the best days of my life, being a kid, the toys and all. I'm 19 right now so it is getting a little more serious and complicated, I've got to pay my own bills you know lol, pay when I go to the movies, work on the weekend... Back to this film, it is really great, I mean it's one of my own classics. The DVD is coming in 2004 and the film will get the IMAX treatment so it should be cool.. Opens in IMAX theaters January 1, 2003!
B00000272N|5.0|I can't tell you how amazing this CD is.  I'm a huge fan of the Seattle grunge-era, though the one band I always distanced myself from was Alice in Chains.  I knew they were a lot heavier sounding than the others, so I put off listening to their stuff.  But this CD can make the biggest metal hater happy--it's that amazing.  If you love metal, you're set, and if you hate it, it's easy to look past the heavy guitars to Layne's amazing vocals, Jerry's undeniable skill, and Sean Kinney's unique style of drumming.  Heck, even the bassist is good.<br />These four men are without a doubt some of the most skilled rock musicians put together, and this album is a wonderful introduction to that.  Facelift isn't my favorite of their albums (personally I like the self-titled one best...), but it's one of the easiest to start with.  My personal favorite song on the album (my favorite song ever) is Love, Hate, Love.  Listen to every part of the song: the drums, Layne's emotions, the haunting guitar riffs, to get the full effect.  Bleed the Freak is a close second ;)
B00006RU5B|5.0|The combination of Chris Cornell and RATM is amazing! These guys are taking rock music to new heights. My favorites are bascially all of them, but \\"Gasoline\\", \\"I am the highway\\", \\"Shadow of the sun\\", \\"What you are\\", \\"Cochise\\", \\"Gasoline\\", and the gem, \\"Like a stone\\". This is one you can put in the CD player and let it play through the whole album. It doesn't get much better than this. I can't wait to see where the talents of this band will take them.
B00006RYIQ|5.0|In terms of the production, this is certainly one of Gene Clark's most uncharacteristic albums. His mournful, mystic Country influences are there but it's all buried under a lavish sea of decadent 1970's style production. The resulting sound is can only be described as Neil Young meets Fleetwood Mac on mescalin. And believe me, that sells it short.<br /><br />Along with fellow Byrd alumi, Gram Parsons, Clark pioneered Country Rock in the late 60's with his now classic, FANTASTIC EXPEDITION OF DILLARD & CLARK. Yet despite wonderfully understated works like WHITE LIGHT, Clark's slow, eerie croon & dense poetical leanings failed to land a commerical audience.<br /><br />NONE OTHER, seems to be Clark's bid for just that. Sadly, it only proved to be the final nail. It's the same old story: Gene Clark was simply a touch too out of step & ahead of his time.<br /><br />Judging from his back cover photo, Clark seems to have been reaching for a wider audience. Gone is the introspective Country/Folk troubador. Almost shockingly, Clark is effeminently decked out like a Glam Rock Lord Byron complete with flowing locks, mascara, lipstick and---is that nail polish? In an era where T-Rex, Bowie & androgyny were all the rage, it appears Clark's record company was out to update his image.<br /><br />\\"Greatest Fool\\" is a deceptively jaunty opener but \\"Silver Raven\\" went on to be Clark's signature tune & is easily among the album's highlights. Yet, the centerpiece remains,\\"Strength Of Strings\\". Along with \\"8 Mile High\\" it's probably Clark's most well known song. The Art Rock collective, This Mortal Coil's did a faithful rendition in th elate 80's but there's no improving the original. Let's just say it's as close as Clark gets to Neil Young's \\"Cowgirl In The Sand\\" . As ethereal as its epic.<br /><br />Throughout, Clark's lyrics remain compellingly ambiguous, which is one of the things that sets NO OTHER apart.  Yet, beneath the album's lush exterior, songs like a \\"A True One\\" & \\"Lady Of The North\\" reveal themselves to be good old fashioned Country weepers.<br /><br />True, by today's standards, the production is a little dated  over the top. But placed in context of it's era, NO OTHER remains an original piece of work. In a class all it's own.<br /><br />Afterwards, Clark seems to have sadly decended into alcholism, occasionally reuiniting with The Byrds. But perhaps, NONE OTHER is not the last chapter. If TWO SIDES TO EVERY STORY ever becomes re-released, it's back to roots aethetics are certain to cement Clark's cult legacy. A legacy that can be heard today in the likes of Wilco, My Mourning Jacket, Ryan Adams & The Ladybug Transistor.f The North\\" reveal themselves to be good old fashioned Country weepers.<br /><br />True, by today's standards, the production is a little dated  over the top.

B000000WJZ|5.0|many people say that this album is overrated. many say that mellon collie is better.  many say that it is just screaming guitars.  the problem with all of these statements is they are usually from the mouths of listeners who first heard of the pumpkins with mellon collie and the infinite sadness.  this is not that album.  this is better.  mellon collie had the radio airplay which made &quot;tonight, tonight&quot;, &quot;zero&quot;, &quot;1979&quot; and &quot;bwbw&quot; such big hits. when siamese dream came out in 1993 the only 'hits' were &quot;today&quot; and &quot;disarm&quot;.  this is a great album but it is not nearly as mainstream or radio-friendly as mc. i have tried to sell people on this album after they have heard mc, and the problem is this is not the same band.  mellon collie is over the top demanding your attention, while siamese dream hits you in the gut to leave you in the fetal position on the floor and could care less if you even knew it was coming. as for the screaming guitars they are here aplenty; however, it is not 80s big hair, nor is it heavy tool, it is euphoric.  give a listen to jimi hendrix's star-spangled banner to get the idea. over all this album is like the beatles &quot;abbey road&quot; (big complement) in the fact there are about two songs everyone knows and the rest is lost on the listener who wants the entire album to be like &quot;come together&quot; or &quot;here comes the sun&quot;. that listener misses out on the subtler hits like &quot;maxwell's silver hammer&quot; and &quot;you never give me your money&quot;. there are hits here that only some will ever appreciate while others will simply stick to tracks 3 and 6. what a shame.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead. I hear this name and it excites me to no extent. I'm sure you've heard it before, and how many RH fans there are. People like them for a reason. And let me say, any review is inadequate, you must hear this album for it to affect you the way it has millions of people.  Please give no consideration to those people who gave this less than 4 stars. This album is beyond anything ever recorded. And yes, it does take a sense of MATURITY that some do not have... <br />Everything from Thom's vocals to Phil's beats are so musical, so brilliant it will put any band to shame. From the opener, Airbag, to the last track, the Tourist, this album is, well, plain flawless. Some just do not take the time to hear them...sure, you may have listened to a few songs of one or 2 of their albums, but Radiohead is deeper than that. Way deeper. I totally agree with the reviewer who said &quot;Thom is sick...sick of society&quot;. He is, and you can hear emotion in everyone of his lyrics of this CD. <br />Please, take in to consideration how much I like music. I listen to everything. Whether it be Miles Davis, PJ Harvey, Opeth, Neutral Milk Hotel, Bach, I listen to it all. And I DAMN well know good music when I hear it. And unlike some people who listened to this album...<br />I hear what their trying to say...
0316666343|1.0|I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone nor would I advise anyone to read it. <BR>yes - maybe it's well written but I found the book to be very shocking, upsetting + not the least bit entertaining.

0553582445|4.0|After fifteen years FitzChivalry has finally emerged out of his shell to once again serve his Crown. Hobb's first series, the Farseer Trilogy, told of Fitz's adolescence and his struggle to aid his king against both the Red-Ship Raiders and the traitorous Prince Regal. Fitz succeeds in this, but at an extremely valuable cost. Even Mrs. Hobb admits that Fitz suffered more than she originally intended. That series was good, but it left quite a bitter aftertaste. Her next series, The Liveship Traders, was in an entirely different vein and seemed more experimental. I thought it had a good start but in the end did not live up to expectations. Now, this series she is working on seems like it will have all the best elements of her fiction with all the bad elements culled out. It seems as if her first two trilogies have been preparing her for this one. I think the book description is right when it says that this trilogy promises to be her most spectacular yet.<br />The story starts with Fitz in his cottage, and I must admit doesn't move from there until page 220.  But it didn't really seem to drag, not too much, anyway. This is because of her superb, perhaps even unmatched, characterization. In all my reading career I don't think I've ever come to know a character more than FitzChivalry. He is extremely well-crafted, with numerous flaws, as of course any person would have. But she doesn't stop with Fitz; all of her characters have such depth- the only difference between them and Fitz is that she reveals Fitz's depth while with the others it remains obscured, and this makes it all the richer. And so it was that throughout this whole book I did not get bored, action or no action. The first 220 pages were not only the story revving up, but also a rehash of the past fifteen years, and I think this is necessary. There is one part where Fitz is telling the Fool of the six years he spent traveling, and this takes up a good portion. I think this is where the book drags most.<br />Finally he leaves his cottage and goes to Buckkeep.  Once there, Chade informs him that Prince Dutiful has gone missing and that Fitz is the only one to find him. So off he goes. By page 300 the action starts picking up, and doesn't stop unitl the climax. I liked the bit about a conspiracy. Hobb's never done anything like that before, and it comes out all right. As they follow the Prince and go deeper the plot becomes darker, though it doesn't get as dark as I would have liked. It's a good story. My four stars are because of the slow start and the fact that the climax seems a bit abrupt. I know I said that I was not bored because of the characterization, but I still could have enjoyed it better if the action was better managed. And if I can think of a way for a book to be better that's not nitpicking, I won't give five stars.<br />This is a good beginning to the series. It had a definate conclusion to it, not leaving many loose ends. I think this is because not only is it a beginning to a trilogy, but it also has to bridge that fifteen-year gap. I get the feeling that the next two books will be more tightly woven together. I also get the feeling that this series will end on a happier note than the previous series. This book, like all Hobb books, was not painless but it did end with a promise of better things to come. Hobb has done much foreshadowing concerning Dutiful, Nettle, and especially the Fool(though I won't say more for those of you who haven't figured it out yet.) I have becaome very attached to Fitz and very much want to see him receive the happiness he deserves.
B000002UBB|4.0|The Steve Miller Band's \\"Fly Like An Eagle\\" album is a staple of classic rock radio today. \\"Rock N' Me\\", \\"Fly Like An Eagle\\", and \\"Take the Money and Run\\" were huge hits and have stood the test of time, still getting steady airplay on classic rock radio. It's also a pretty diverse album with the blues of \\"Sweet Maree\\"  and \\"Mercury Blues\\", the country of \\"Dance, Dance, Dance\\", and a cover of the soul classic \\"You Send Me\\". There's also the heavy keyboard flourishes on \\"Wild Mountain Honey\\" and \\"Serenade\\", which is just as catchy as \\"Rock N' Me\\", and may be the best song on the album. So why not 5 stars? First, this album clearly needs to be remastered as the sound quality is  not up to par with the excellent material. Second, if you want the most popular tracks, you can just pick up Greatest Hits 1974-78, as the 7 best and most popular songs are on there. The other tracks include \\"The Window\\", the closing track, which isn't up to par with the rest of the album and 2 keyboard intros which have not stood the test of time. If you're looking for the stunning blues guitar of his earlier albums, you're not going to find it here. If you just want the best songs, your best bet is to just pick up Greatest Hits 1974-78.
B000089RVX|5.0|The only CD I've ever bought where EVERY song is great!!!!
B00006LI4S|3.0|I don't agree with all the hype about this DVD.  The concert seems flat.  Selection of songs was fair.  I don't think David put much effort into this.  Dolby 5.1 is only for crowd noise.  He didn't play that long.  The only reason the DVD was longer is because they added music from another concert.  When compared to Roger Waters &quot;In the Flesh&quot;, (5 Stars), this DVD is poor. It appears Roger put much more work and effort into his concert.
B000089RVX|5.0|I bought this album despite hearing the wanna-be Linkin Park rap infusion of their first hit single.<BR>Amy's voice is mesmerizing, so I wanted to hear more.<BR>I was blown away and hooked like a junkie.<BR>Annoying the boyfriend because it's on constant rotation in the car.  &quot;Touniquet&quot; is my favorite track off this album. Boy can I ever identify with these lyrics.<BR>A must have for the Gothy, sulky people out there. Was surprised to learn that this was on a &quot;Christian&quot; label though. But maybe it took a &quot;higher power&quot; to bring these ethereal songs to earth.
B00008NG5V|4.0|Hey, it doesnt match up to Brushfire Fairytales, but who cares? Brushfire Fairytales gave the mainstream a breath of fresh air, a surf/california type folk chill music that proves irresistible to a wide array of listeners.   This album lacks the really strong tracks from BF (such as flake, or bubble toes) but this album is a mellow, tropical ride through over 15 tracks of acoustic folk.  His style stays the same on this album, and doesnt really try anything new, but it works for him.  &quot;The horizon ahs been defeated&quot; has a great reggae vibe to it, but the reason this CD doesnt get 5 stars is because of some lack of originality of the songs.  Dont get me wrong, there are some really solid melodies on this CD and there isnt really anyone else out like him in the mainstream right now, but there could have been a bit more variety.
B00005OM4N|3.0|For the past two years, I have been a dear fan and defender of Britney Spears. Most of my friends and people I encounter dismiss her as a teeny-bopper, no-talent kid with a mediocre voice whose success can only be attributed to a top-notch marketing team. I beg to differ, and argue that Britney is an extremely talented, hot performer, who dazzles audiences with her moves and intensity and who carries herself with such grace and poise for such a successful teenager. My sympathizers above age 16, who exist in scattered corners across the globe, believe that she will have as much staying power as Madonna, that she is her de-facto successor.<br />I was waiting in anticipation for her new release, \\"Britney\\", named such because it is said to capture her essence, her personality. It is the most personally revealing of her albums thus far, including four singles co-written by the pop-queen herself. This is precisely why the album is so disturbing. Whereas her previous album, \\"Oops! I Did it Again\\" pulls no punches, and contains twelve fun tracks with a quality upbeat pop sound and generic pop messages of betrayal, love and girl power, her new album tries way too hard to relay Britney's personality. The ultimate message - she hasn't figured it out just yet.<br />There is too much uncertainty and there are way too many inconsistencies in the track. In the same song, \\"I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman\\", she goes from pouting that she is not a girl only to end up saying, \\"you'll see it in my eyes, this GIRL will always find her way\\" (emphasis mine). In the second track, \\"Overprotected\\", she asks, \\"what's a girl supposed to do?\\" reminding us of her girly identity and surprising us with an argument that she's overprotected when we all know what her mother lets her wear. Her deliberate emphasis on her maturity only belittles the maturity she definitely has. This is particularly evident in the fifth track, \\"Boys,\\" which is filled with mixed messages. Previously, she argues that she's neither a girl nor a woman, yet she moans and groans about wanting a boy. Women don't want boys, and girls do not yet know how to heave sexually the way that she does.<br />The styles of the songs are as uncertain as the content. \\"Overprotected\\" is one of the few songs that continue the same type of beat and rhythm as the bouncy, dance-able songs in \\"Oops!\\" Then she and her writers experiment with a more choppy rhythm and blues sound, as that in \\"Boys,\\" designed to reflect her \\"growing maturity.\\" They insert a cover of \\"I Love Rock n' Roll\\" to remind us that Britney is also a champion of classic rock. \\"That's Where You Take Me\\" makes a 180 turn to a starry-eyed love ballad. The listener is left bemused. Too much mixing of too many elements stays true with the overall message of the CD - that Britney herself seems somewhat confused.<br />Artists, even pop-artists, are allowed to be confused, but mostly they should have something to say and a way to say it -even if it's a simple message like, \\"Hit Me Baby One More Time.\\" What, you might ask, did Britney (and her writers) have to say before? She said that girls and women, yes women, should have fun, they should be reminded of the gift of their beauty, their body, their strength, their sexuality, their potential for success. That's what she offered us. That was her gift.<br />This album ruins it for us. Not only that, she gives me cause to actually agree with those who give me a strange look for liking her so much. She gives them a sort of confirmation. Sometimes, you are most critical of those you love. Britney, be proud of your success and sexuality. You need no excuses. Just keep on dancing and sing that you are a woman.neither a girl nor a woman, yet she moans and groans about wanting a boy. Women don't want boys, and girls do not yet know how to heave sexually the way that she does.<br />The styles of the songs are as uncertain as the content. \\"Overprotected\\" is one of the few songs that continue the same type of beat and rhythm as the bouncy, dance-able songs in \\"Oops!\\" Then she and her writers experiment with a more choppy rhythm and blues sound, as that in \\"Boys,\\" designed to reflect her \\"growing maturity.\\" They insert a cover of \\"I Love Rock n' Roll\\" to remind us that Britney is also a champion of classic rock. \\"That's Where You Take Me\\" makes a 180 turn to a starry-eyed love ballad.

Too much mixing of too many elements stays true with the overall message of the CD - that Britney herself seems somewhat confused.<br />Artists, even pop-artists, are allowed to be confused, but mostly they should have something to say and a way to say it -even if it's a simple message like, \\"Hit Me Baby One More Time.\\" What, you might ask, did Britney (and her writers) have to say before? She said that girls and women, yes women, should have fun, they should be reminded of the gift of their beauty, their body, their strength, their sexuality, their potential for success. That's what she offered us. That was her gift.<br />This album ruins it for us. Not only that, she gives me cause to actually agree with those who give me a strange look for liking her so much. She gives them a sort of confirmation. Sometimes, you are most critical of those you love. Britney, be proud of your success and sexuality. You need no excuses. Just keep on dancing and sing that you are a woman.
0684833395|4.0|Catch 22 is satirical novel which pokes fun at many different parts of our society. It manly criticizes capitalism, the army, and the chain of commands that it consists of. Some readers may dislike this anti-military tone. I liked this novel because Heller's original and repetitive style of writing was funny as well as influential, but by no means is it easy to read. A less competent reader may not enjoy the book as much because the underlining humor may not be understood. The plot and character development is choppy making it difficult to understand the story line. In order to enjoy the novel you must enjoy the humor because the plot itself is not interesting enough to cary you through the book.
B000002UAX|5.0|There are a few albums from the rock era that I feel I've been in a relationship with since the first day I got them. \\"The Beatles\\" is one of those albums. I found it under my Christmas tree in 1968, and I've been engaged with it at some level ever since. It is not the best Beatles album, objectively; nor is it my favorite. But it has always compelled my attention.<br />At the time it came out, I was 12, but even then it was clear that we were no longer in Pepperland or on a Magical Mystery Tour. This album wasn't yet more \\"progress\\" toward some new musical form. Musically, it embraced values never before associated with the Beatles as I understood them: Parody, pastiche, rock and roll revivalism, music-hall nostalgia, avant-garde experimentation, political agitation, intimate confession, trivial nonsense. It is, simply, a series of highly personal statements from the three songwriters, coalescing around no particular theme other than the right to personal expression.<br />\\"The Beatles\\" is not, to me, \\"the sound of the Beatles breaking up.\\" That's the storyline a lot of Beatle historians apply to this album. If they're basing this judgement on the fact that the individual songwriters' imprints are on each song, you'd have to argue that the breakup began much earlier, around the time of \\"Beatles for Sale\\" or \\"Help!\\" Lennon-McCartney were rarely a songwriting \\"team\\" in the sense of George and Ira Gershwin. Their partnership was always about strategy, i.e. how to ensure that third-rate songs would not be included on albums just for the sake of fairness. \\"The Beatles\\" instead simply shows the evolution of each of the three songwriters (on this album, George emerges dramatically) as they each embraced new musical ideas and applied their life experiences to their art. Having helped break all the molds for what was acceptable songwriting in their previous work, they each now proceeded to take full advantage of the freedom they'd won. Some of the dumber cuts on \\"The Beatles\\" demonstrate, perhaps, the expression \\"freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose.\\" Paul, in particular, seemed frightened to step out too often without the crutch of some existing form that he could parody or pay tribute to, i.e. \\"Honey Pie,\\" \\"Back in the USSR\\" or \\"Rocky Racoon.\\" But, while you can say that, you have to acknowledge that in this massive album, there are perhaps half a dozen Paul songs that are among his best and most original: \\"I Will,\\" \\"Blackbird,\\" \\"Mother Nature's Son,\\" \\"Helter Skelter\\" for four examples.<br />Lennon's direction was to become more nakedly confessional, as befits someone who was dealing with such turbulent emotions at the time. He gives us some of his most beautiful songs, like \\"Dear Prudence,\\" and some of his most intense, like \\"I'm So Tired,\\" \\"Revolution,\\" \\"Yer Blues,\\" and \\"Sexy Sadie.\\" Often, as in \\"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill,\\" \\"Glass Onion,\\" or \\"Everybody Has Something to Hide Except for Me and My Monkey,\\" he seems to be writing in code, and that sense of allusiveness gives the album much of its cracked character. And of course, he's the guy who assembled the collage, \\"Revolution 9,\\" which is to rock and roll what \\"Finnegans Wake\\" is to English literature--a dream that floats between meaning and nothingness.<br />George seems to be captured here in a moment of great self-discovery as an artist; you can hear his talent finally come together in \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\\" which I remember at age 12 was to my ears the best thing on the album--and still seems to be so. Prior to the White Album, he had these cautious little songs on the early albums, and then embraced India, which while sometimes satisfying seemed weird and out of place. His songs here sets the stage for \\"Something,\\" \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and then his monumental early solo work.  At age 12, I thought \\"Long, Long, Long\\" was a emotional powerhouse--and I still do.<br />A few months after I got \\"The Beatles,\\" the Charles Manson murders took place, and eventually the DA made the case that somehow, insanely, the murders were inspired by songs on this album. Around the same time, the media were full of bizarre speculation that Paul McCartney was dead, and that clues were all over this album. It's no accident that half-insane people might mine \\"The Beatles\\" for hidden messages and evidence of conspiracies. The world it depicts is strange and almost claustrophobic--all the more so for its haphazard approach and its odd switches in tone from childish delight to fiendish paranoia. But even those of us who live normal lives and dream normal dreams can acknowledge that \\"The Beatles\\" has a hold on your consciousness that is unlike anything else the group did, and unlike anything else that came out of the rock era.place, and eventually the DA made the case that somehow, insanely, the murders were inspired by songs on this album.

B00008J4P5|3.0|Seven nation army is the best song on the album, the rest range from being good to downright retarded.  On one track you have to listen to a man talk about how squirrels hide their nuts for a minute and a half.
B000001EUP|4.0|Yes, this is one of the Scorpions' best, yes, Matthias Jabs is underrated...  But Ulrich Roth is a genius!  And if you want to talk underrated, what about Rudolf Schenker?  For my money, in terms of rhythm guitarists, he's right up there with Keith Richards, and that's what my money says, so put your money down! (thank you Hank Rollins...).  Rudi is the man!
B000084T18|5.0|i think this cd is one of the best rap cds to come out this year.  it has a gangsta attitude, but also some slower more sensitive feel to them.  anyone who is thinking about buying this should go out now and buy it!
B000066NW0|2.0|While Avril did release one song that I really liked (\\"I'm With You\\"), she basically is another talentless and manufactured pop artist (think Britney). But aren't we all used to those by now? Her music is all about marketing, an image, and making money. How American for a Canadian!

B00004BZ0N|5.0|This is an amazing CD. The gritty old school punk vocals and properly played instruments are used to strengthen truly great and meaningful lyrics.  Altogether, this is great music, and a truly essential collection of evocative ballads.<br /><br />For those who wish for nothing more but to go out and have a good time, I recommend this CD.  To those who wish the be mentally challenged and stimulated, buy this CD.  Also, those who do not necessarily live the easiest lives, this CD will help you feel happy; problems can be solved. This CD always cheers me up when I need it, and also pumps me up when I'm in my pseudo-conscious morning state.<br /><br />I recommend this CD to anyone, whether they are so self-involved as to call themselves \\"punk\\" or if it is just some guy or girl who wants to buy a good CD. Buy London Calling, or steal it, just get possession of it any way possible. You need it.
B00007E8O5|5.0|This album is a giant! Having initially bought the shorter version of \\"Degradation Trip\\" it was interesting to hear the original songlist on this a two-and-a-half-hour monumental landmark by Jerry Cantrell.<BR>The disc 1 songlist is largely similar to the shorter version of \\"Degradation Trip\\".<BR>\\"Degradation Trip\\" is the most wonderful musical ride I've ever taken, and by far the longest. Mike Bordin and Rob Trujillo were a fantastic choice for drummer and bassist, bringing their own styles into the most guitar-saturated album in history. Here, Jerry has churned out 25 incredibly self-indulgent songs, many of which relate to his old friend Layne Staley. Since the loss of Layne I was eager to hear what Jerry would come up with, knowing that \\"Degradation Trip\\" was in the making.<BR>The vocal sound on \\"Psychotic Break\\" sounds incredibly like the dual vocals of Jerry and Layne on the Alice in Chains \\"Grind\\" album. And with the closing line \\"thinking about my dead friends whose voices ring on\\", theres enough symbolism to send chills up my spine. Songs are very dark and heartfelt, with some more uptempo tunes appearing here and there; \\"Locked On\\", \\"Gone\\" which is a nice country-sounding tune and \\"She was my Girl\\" are a few examples of these. Frequently one can hear several guitar rhythmns and melodies interlocking and fusing together throughout songs, at times up to 4 or 5 different guitar lines play in parallel, producing that nice guitar-drenched atmosphere presented on \\"Degradation Trip\\". \\"Hurts Don't it?\\" is a beautiful instrumental with wonderful guitar lines, this is one of my favourite songs on the \\"trip\\". The darker elements of the album lie in \\"Dying Inside\\", a brilliant bulky song, \\"Pig Charmer\\", where Jerry realates abck to old days with Layne aswell as \\"Bargain Basement Howard Hughes\\", \\"Solitude\\", a ballard presenting lyrics which are very likely Jerry's attempt to talk to his dying friend, and \\"Feel the Void\\" which sounds like Jerry's own interpretation of how Layne may be feeling. Some nice crunching riffs scattered all over the album remind the listener of Jerry's riffing back in Alice in Chains, and his ability to churn out excellent brutal riffs. \\"Spiderbite\\", \\"Anger Rising\\" and \\"Owned\\" demonstrate this. \\"Angel Eyes\\" and \\"Siddhartha\\" are two very different songs but are both among my favourites on this album, great musicianship with dark tones. <BR>It could take forever to analyse every song here. Overall this is one of the greatest albums ever, by one of my favourite musicians ever. I doubt I'll ever see an album so long and never boring the listener for one second as \\"Degradation Trip\\" does. My favourite songs on this album are: \\"Locked On\\", \\"Angel Eyes\\", \\"Hurts Don't it?\\", \\"Dying Inside\\" and \\"Siddhartha\\".<BR>Extremely enjoyable.
B00008NG5V|4.0|So this was my first exposure to Johnson, and I came to him via Ben Harper (I'm new to him, too) and the recommendation of a friend.  I first checked out &quot;the horizon has been defeated&quot; on his website and was pleasantly (that word's not strong enough) greeted by a groove fat enough to surf on.  <br />Some impressions:<BR>-- Some of the songs seem woefully brief, leaving me gasping for more; Johnson must have felt that the nugget of the song was fully expressed in one &amp; a half or two minutes. I'd like to see him live and see if any of these get salt-water-taffied into jams. <BR>-- There are certain albums and/or songs that immediately conjure up a mental picture for me:  I'm riding in a car on a sunny, breezy day, windows down, someone else is driving, and I'm totally relaxed.  This album did that for me.  It's a rainy day/chill out/need to think/had a bad day/kickin' it with a friend album.<BR>-- I'm pleased with the thoughtfulness in lyrics.  &quot;Tomorrow Morning&quot;'s &quot;what would you do if I wrote you a song?/would you give me some lovin' when I get home?&quot; is my current ohrwurm.  It's an evocative wisp of thought.<BR>-- &quot;Horizon&quot; is an undeniable reggae-flavored groove, but the fact that it's a single belies the fact that most, if not all, of the album has a different feel.  I'm guessing one of the reasons it seems to be the single is that it's stylistically close to Ben Harper's new album -- and they're currently touring together.  I may see this tour -- it's sure to be a good time.<BR>-- My roommate, scanning the liner notes, exclaimed, &quot;He's just a regular-looking guy!&quot;  I got that impression, too, from the layout and notes... I dig that.<br />Overall, a terrific buy.  I'll be wearing this one out all summer long.
B00008NG5V|5.0|Even though there are some old songs on this CD it's SWEET!  Jack Johnson is wonderful.  His music is uplifting, happy and always makes me smile when I hear it!!  :-)
B00008H2LE|5.0|Well i'm writing this kinda late...the album has been out for a couple months now, i got the oppurtunity to be invited to their 2nd music video shoot for \\"faint\\" last month in Hollywood, CA... and after reading a good majority of these reviews (starting with the poor reviews first because i wanted to see what exactly people didnt like about METEORA) and i have come to the conclusion that LINKIN PARK IS STILL #1 in my book and the negative reviews on here were rather weak and bleak and seemed to come from people who are just interested in a certain genre of music...if u go through life putting a label on everything thats just sad...love the music for what it is and how it speaks to you, NOT for where its shelved at the local store...so if you truly are a die-hard fan of LINKIN PARK you should definitely buy this cd, ESPECIALLY if u don't have it by now...My favorite songs on the album are...well u know whut, i have the album in my car's alpine and everytime i play it, i just automatically hit shuffle because every song on this album is great and unique in its own way...so coming from a TRUE fan i highly recommend that u purchase METEORA...A+++ i would have given 10 STARS if it went up that high on here...
B00004T9UH|3.0|Well if u r one of those ppl hu love violent rap lyrics. this is 4 u. Im not one of those ppl but i still think this album is well presented. i like how eminem is prooud of being white instead of just trying to be black

B00006690G|4.0|This album is damn good. Eminem expresses his respect for tupac which is great and he also does a fabulous job with the beats..............or was that DRE? Lyrically though, eminem is great. My fav track is Say what you say where em's rap is totally real.
0060512806|5.0|Both the present day and WW2 stories in this novel are brilliant and hilarious. Bobby Shaftoe obsesses on how a Komodo Dragon saved him from a Japanese Pillbox while high on morphine horrifying all he comes in contact with. In present day Seattle, poor Daniel Waterhouse is humiliated when the girl he is courting is forced to watch his math/science geek family divide up a deceased relatives possessions by charting them in a parking lot with the x axis being their monetary value and the y axis their sentimental value. A discussion of what makes an oral surgeon truly brilliant had me in stitches. You have to read it to believe it. <br />I found Snow Crash to be interesting but also far-fetched, this is a wonderful historical epic that had me thinking and laughing on every page. <br />I beg you to read it.
B000023VR9|5.0|this album is fabulous it consists of big beats with wonderful lyrics. Tha doc shows of his guest rappers as he has several respectable names in his album. My favourite track is Stil D.R.E. It reminds me of tha old DRE!
B00005JKZV|5.0|I have been a huge fan of the book since I was 12. Two Towers differs from the book more than Fellowship and probably more than Return of the King will. Some of the changes at first glance make you do a double take. However as one examines them closer the reasons and motives are apparent and make sense when making a movie. Some deal with portraying something that happened in  the book in a different way. The Elves fighting for one. In the book they fight on their own front. However since this is not seen in the movie it would be good to show the elves involed. The other huge change was Faramir. However his change was inevitably set up int he first movie where all men, even Aragorn are tempted by the ring of power. Therefore to stay consistant one must also show Faramir as such.<br />This is a great great movie. It is different from the first as it is more spread out following different people and places. It is an excellent continuation of the Greatest story of our time. One can sit there and pick at it or sit back get lost and let the emotion, terror, and shear magnitude take you. It truely is a slendid sight. I cannot wait to see the Return of the King.
B00005AQEA|5.0|this album is so real that it makes every other rapper in tha game look [bad]. I luv this album. Its tupacs best and since every one of tupacs albums are damn good it just goes to show how cool this album is. Tha only other albums to cmpare with this album are: R U STILL DOWN REMEMBER ME-2PAC CHRONIC 2001-DR DRE GREATEST HITS-2PAC LIFE AFTER DEATH- NOTORIOUS BIG
B00008S2VG|3.0|Maybe I'm still stuck in the 'ray of light' thing, but I wasn't all that impressed with 'American Life'.  We all know Madonna is the queen of reinvention, after all she's done it with nearly every album.  But personally, I think that it may have been wise for her to stay on top of the world with 'Ray of Light', or even 'Music'.  She had honesty in both her previous albums, but it was a more artistic honesty.  This album just sounds like she's free-writing, like she's not putting any construction into what she's singing.  There are some beautiful moments on this album, but they are few and far between.  The upside is Madonna sounds much more mature than she has in the past.  Her voice has finally become smooth enough for her to really support a slow ballad.  It actually fits her well, with it's haunting qualities.  She has a ghostly voice, one that lingers in your head once her song has finished.  That's probably the only reason her lyrics fit the stubborn and gutless music.  Most of the music on this album has little that will move or impress you, and it almost seems as though Madonna isn't living up to her true talent.  The biggest problem on this album is the repetition.  At least on 'Ray of Light' the songs had enough variation to keep you interested, but this album is nothing but lullaby rhymes backed by simple guitar riffs and harsh beats.  There's so much more to this woman than this.  I hope her next album is more intense, emotional, or... something.  Anything would be nice.  The rare moments on this album?  The strings on tracks 10 and 11, the truthful (if harsh) rap in track 1, and the voice morphs in track 9.  Those are the goods.  But hey, if you like hip hop and/or slower house and trance, this is your cup of tea.
B0000399WI|5.0|theres nuthing left to say......... Brilliance at its best
B00001OH82|5.0|Can't understand how this album flopped.  This is David's most energetic sounding work since the early 80's.  Most of the songs are great.  Gabrels is amazing!  If you are a Bowie fan you should get this.  It's a side of him that you don't see often.
6304398395|3.0|&quot;Chaplin&quot; is another in a long line of three hour biopics that are unoriginally named after their subject's last name, and which whisk us impressively through their lives without ever revealing much depth. Be it said that Downey does a good job recreating some of Chaplin's comic grace (though the scene in which Chaplin runs onto Mack Sennett's set and improvises and entire movie while others play along seems unrealistic.) The movie is told in a series of flashbacks that involve the old, bitter Chaplin discussing his life from exile in Switzerland, usually complaining of one of his ex-wives that he &quot;hated the little --tch.&quot; Indeed, this film seeks to turn a splendid career and a complex man into a rather dark story that leaves us wanting to go watch a real Chaplin film and cheer up.
B00008XEP5|5.0|This is the stuff!  For anyone who owns &quot;Behold the..&quot; You owe it to yourself to own this version.

B00004YA66|5.0|The paradoxes of time travel are enough to convince most people that it is impossible, along with warp drive, transporter beams, and lots of other staples of science fiction.  Still, writers persist in telling time travel stories and we continue to enjoy them, usually because they are about something else besides time travel.  The deciding factor is not the scientific logic of the method of time travel, because ultimately the rationale simply has to be plausible enough to engage our willing suspension of disbelief.  There are many people who enjoyed \\"Somewhere in Time\\" and that involved Christopher Reeves' character THINKING himself back to the past.  In the end all that matters are two things.  First, that there is a logical consistency to the rules of the game, whatever they might be.  Second, that there is an emotional payoff to the story that is told under these circumstances.  This is why the \\"Star Trek\\" episode \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" and the very best episodes of \\"Quantum Leap\\" were so fantastic.<br />The script for \\"Frequency\\" written by Toby Emmerich meets both of those criteria.  On the logical consistency axis the twist is to have a time travel story where nobody actually travels through time.  Instead the aurora borealis allows a father, Frank Sullivan (Dennis Quaid) and son, John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel) living in the same house in Queens to talk over the same ham radio set despite the difference of thirty years.  On the emotional payoff scale there is the fact that the father died thirty years ago fighting a fire and the son, who was only 6 at the time, is desperate to reach back into the past, not only to save his father's life but to stop his own life from going into the gutter.  Now, that could be an entire movie right there.  But for Emmerich and director Gregory Hoblit that is just the opening act of the story, because no good deed goes unpunished and if the old chestnut about stepping on a butterfly in the age of dinosaurs could chain out and change the fate of humanity you can imagine what the saving of a life accomplishes.  What starts off as a science fiction/fantasy story suddenly becomes a thriller.<br />I thought the ways the rules of the game were exploited in \\"Frequency\\" was brilliant from a narrative standpoint.  Of course if you change the past you change the future, but in \\"Frequency\\" this does not happen instantly from John's perspective.  He can tell the new \\"memories\\" from the old as things change.  Granted, this is a dramatic device that comes into play big time in the film's climax, but that is why the logical consistency matters more than the scientific and the ending is set up by more subtle examples of the principle at work earlier in the film.  I also like the way that the 1969 World Series was used in this film (I got up in the middle of the night to listen to the games on Armed Forces Radio in Japan that year, so I have strong memories of it as well) and the way that John and his father try to figure out ways of working together to change the past so they have a future.<br />I never took physics, so I did not having any annoying scientific facts gnawing at my brain while enjoying this film, which may be why I had no problem seeing what happened in this movie as being logically consistent.  I just understood the rules and thoroughly enjoyed the film.  I thought I had the ending pegged, but was pleasantly surprised with what happened instead (however, on the audio commentary by the director Hoblit reveals that the ending he wanted to shoot was the one I envisioned).  For those of little scientific faith there are a series of explanations offered on the added attractions on the disc, which includes the usually deleted and extended scenes, and three audio commentary tracks by (1) the director Hoblit, (2) the writer Toby Emmerich and his brother Noah, who plays Gordo Hersch, John's next door neighbor and best friend; and (3) composer Michael Kamen.  When you do any of those be sureto turn on the trivia captions as well.  This is one of those DVDs where any doubts about rating are erased by the bonus features.<br />Ultimately, I found \\"Frequency\\" to be almost as good as the \\"Leap Home\\" two-part episode of \\"Quantum Leap,\\" the best time travel story I have ever seen.  That is high praise indeed.  Final Note:  That was not just any episode of \\"Hill Street Blues\\" on the television that John is watching in his home early in the film but \\"Trial by Fury,\\" the season premier for the show's third season.  It was not only directed by Hoblit, but was the show that earned the series another Best Drama Emmy and remains one of the Top 10 television episodes I have ever seen in my life.e sure to turn on the trivia captions as well.

B00000DC10|5.0|At first i thought this album had a pretentious name. I still think it does because its basically post hardcore. Lots of other bands are doing weird stuff with punk. When I first listened to this album I didnt like it. It was because I was listining to it fairly quiet as to not disturb my family. But once I threw this baby on loud, its awsome. The sound seems to rise out of the speakers and shift in a 3d noise spectrum. Its pretty cool. Im not going to say this is the shape of punk to come, Good Charolette seem to be shaping the shape of punk to come. But this is a good album.
630463949X|5.0|I have always been aware of Fleetwood Mac, but for some reason never got into them..til now!  It's primarily because of this DVD and accompanying CD.  I stumbled across the CD in my husband's collection and thought it was great.  After buying the 2CD greatest hits collection, I figured my DVD assortment needed a bit of Mac, so I went for THE DANCE.  I was not disappointed.<BR>This DVD is absolutely fantastic.  The sound is great, the picture is excellent, the song selection hits all the classic material, and the band just blows me away.  Many of the songs, like &quot;Say You Love Me,&quot; &quot;Big Love&quot; and &quot;Landslide,&quot; come across even better here than the original studio cuts.  Although Stevie Nicks isn't hitting all the high notes in songs like &quot;Dreams,&quot; opting to hit lower notes that fit in the song, she still sounds great.  Mick Fleetwood and John McVie pack a powerful bottom end punch.  Christine McVie, even though looking bored at times throughout the show, sounds crystal clear (and her song &quot;Temporary One&quot; is a major highlight).  My favorite is watching Lindsey Buckingham play his unique style of guitar, which I have become enamoured with.  A particular favorite moment is his solo rendition of &quot;Big Love.&quot;  Too quote one Jeff Spicoli, &quot;Awesome.  Totally awesome!&quot;  One final added bonus, and missing from the CD, is Christine McVie's playing of &quot;Songbird&quot; at the end of the show.<BR>I honestly can't find a bad thing to say about this disc.  Whether you're a seasoned Fleetwood Mac fan, just starting your collection, or just looking for a video version of their best material, this DVD should hit the spot!
B00000DC7J|5.0|This album is very good. The whole thing is amazingly composed and aranged. There is little to say besides that fact that is basically perfect. Its a good album for younger listeners to get into because its powerful and fast and interesting. But it contains a depth that older listiners will never get tired of. Also very atmospheric. A must have.
B000000993|4.0|This is one of my favorite Tool cds.The vocals (like always) were absolutely awesome on this disc.Maynard knows just how to blend his awesome melodic singing with his unique screams to make a very good vocalist.The music is as great as Tool's music always is.They really know how to do what they do.My advise:GO OUT AND GET IT!!!!!
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is absolutley one of my favorite albums of all time. Christina divulges into so many styles that there is something for everyone. Even if you don't like pop music, there will be at least a few songs on this album b/c its not really a pop album. Its a very mature, adult contemporary diverse effort.<br />CAN'T HOLD US DOWN - Great R&B song. Very catchy beat.<BR>WALK AWAY - One of my favorites. This song is so soulful and beatuiful.<BR>FIGHTER - Another great song. I love the live rock rhythm it has. This song would be great for karaoke.<BR>INFATUATION - Great Latin song.<BR>LOVING ME FOR ME - Very Jill Scott'esque. If Christina were black, this would be a definite hit on R&B stations. Pop stations would never understand this song.<BR>IMPOSSIBLE - This song has great soul rhythm and would go well as a final single.<BR>UNDERAPRECIATED - One of the lower points of the album. The lyrics are cute but the Latin vibe didn't work as well for this track as it did for iNFATUATION<BR>BEAUTIFUL - Absolutley the most \\"beautiful\\" track on the record. Very simply written, simply sung and overall excellent.<BR>MAKE OVER - Another rock track that doesn't work that well.<BR>CRUZ - I would love to play this song when leaving for college. Its very smooth and great for leaving troubles behind.<BR>SOAR - The most inspirational song on the record. Very gospel'esque. This would be a great hit for gospel stations. sounds like something Michael Jackson would sing.<BR>GET MINE, GET YOURS - The most poppy song on the record but its my fave fast song. Its very teasy and sexual. Its great.<BR>DIRRTY - Good party song...but not much else to it.<BR>THE VOICE WITHIN - Great motivational gospel-like song.<BR>I'M OKAY - Very personal for Christina. Depressing but good.<BR>KEEP ON SINGIN MY SONG - Great way to end the record. after all the ups and downs she's keeping on.<BR>ABSOLUTELY ONE OF THE BEST RECORDS OF ALL TIME. BUY IT!!!
B00008J4P5|5.0|Jack White is the musical messiah of the new millenia! If you can't figure that out on your own after listening to this album then there's no hope for you.  His lyrics are some of the most original is music today, and his appreciation of Rocks roots is evident in every ear-splitting, breath-taking guitar solo he plays.  <BR> I loved WHITE BLOOD CELLS, and I had hoped that ELEPHANT would be even better. Lucky me. Simply put, ELEPHANT is a masterpiece. It bursts out from the gate with the amazingly [great] song, \\"Seven Nation Army\\" and ends with a cutesy but comical \\"Well It's True That We Love One Another\\". In between there's the most inspired Led Zep song ever, \\"Ball and Biscuit\\".  Awesome. Awesome.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|I listened to this cd 5 times the first time I heard it.  Just excellent!  Very Refreshing to hear a group with a hard edge and great lyrics put out probably what will be their best selling cd .  EVERY song rocks.  I havn't been to a concert since I saw Soundgarden live 9 years ago.  I'm going to see Godsmack in June to hear these tunes live.  If you're a fan.. this is a no-brainer must have.
B000002WCJ|5.0|In all honestly, not all the songs on here blow me away ... &quot;We got the right&quot; and &quot;Always walk alone&quot; are not the greatest ... but the rest is definitly a factor into this being the classic it is. With songs like &quot;Dr.Stein&quot;, &quot;Rise and Fall&quot;, &quot;I want out&quot; and &quot;March of time&quot; ... how can you go wrong? Not to mention one of the best power metal songs EVER, &quot;Eagle Fly Free&quot; ... the band shows great talent, on every instrument, and with out-of-this-world vocals, and it's all show-cased in &quot;Eagle Fly Free&quot; ... that song alone is worth the buy. If you are looking for a Helloween CD that isn't too goofy, (like some are) and you are looking to buy one of your first power metal albums ... here you go ... of course there is always the full version, but I have this one ... chances are you'll like it, it's a classic, buy it.
B000088E6M|5.0|What can i say about this album? This is the hottest album out there. 50 cent has the gansta attitude most rappers now lack (e.g. Ja rule, Jay-Z, etc.) He takes his life and makes it into a masterpiece with this album. The beats and lyrics in this album are impressive and is full of \\"Heat\\". With the collaboration of Eminem and the G-unit soldiers, this album is a most have. From the intro to the last track this album can match those greats like \\"Illmatic\\" and \\"Ready to die\\". 50 is going to take the throne of hip hop. GGGG-UNIT
B000021XS0|5.0|BUY THIS CD! On one hand, I suppose it does take a musician (which I am) to see how incredibly talented these guys are. If you are not blown away by the drums, then you do not know what you are talking about. I have never heard better drum parts ... exept maybe Chad Sexton or Neil Purt, but Dream Theater's style of music appeals to a wider audience, so Mike Portnoy is most fitfully famous. And being a drummer, I would buy this CD simply to marvel at his brillance.<br />With that aside, this CD is INSANELY technical ... the bass and guitar parts are also mind-blowing, so don't get me wrong. Now lyrically, I don't know what to say ... the story seems to come out in bits and pieces, and I don't fully comprehend, even after about 5 listens, but from the little I did get, it's very interesting, it looks at the issue of death, and it's dark at times, then it talks about the happiness of being spirited away ... interesting, I don't know what else to say. <br />Between style and talent, it is hard for me to find a band that I would say is deserving of the lime light ... but they fit the bill. And this CD is their gleaming pearl, their gem, their masterpeice ... if you want to know what music is, know what talented musicians sound like when they give it their all ... buy this ... buy it, RIGHT NOW!!!
0440237688|5.0|This book is about a young boy far in the future that gets assigned a very important job. He lives in a community where everbody is equal.  Nobody can see color or have memories of their pasts.  There is only one person in this community that has these memories; he is called the reciever of memories.  The reciever's name is the Giver.  The boy, Jonas, is assigned to be the next reciever.  The giver has to transport all of his memories from the past to Jonas.  When he gives Jonas the memories he loses them.  He gives him memories like war, family, love, and hurt.  All of these things are only understood by Jonas and the Giver.  This is the best book I have read in a long time.  I do not enjoy reading very much, but this book hooked me.  I read it in three days.  I recommend this book for people who like the idea of the future and have a curiousity about different lifestyles.
B000006ZL4|5.0|People need to stop writing reviews that use improper English and/or spelling. Are you really going to listen to someone who sounds like they didn't make it past the 2nd grade? I am here to say that this CD is jaw-dropping,and unbelievably technical. I once heard that their musicianship rivaled that of Dream Theatre's, and I thought; &quot;Not possible.&quot; ... but truely it is possible. The tracks &quot;Pharoah&quot;, &quot;The Accolade&quot;, and &quot;The Witching Hour&quot; are catchy and vastly superior in technicality to any other music out there, amazing. The song &quot;Divine Wings of Tragedy&quot; will prove to you once and for all, they have the talent of few or no others. If you are a fan of ANY genre of metal, and you possess your sanity, buy this CD right now.
0316666343|3.0|Your emotions can't help but be stirred by this book. The storyline is an excellent idea as disturbing as it may be to any parent.<br />As good as this book is, you can't help thinking it could have been so much better. Somewhere along the line it seems as though the writer just gets tired of writing and wants to wrap things up. There are also times it could have been more suspenseful, but the opportunity is allowed to pass.<br />It's still worth the read.
B00006F7S4|5.0|It seems like it takes a while for this CD to grow on some people, but I was immediately hooked by the sparse but masterful production and achingly sad and beautiful songs. This is more than just a &quot;break-up&quot; CD, Beck is taking his personal pain and transforming it into something much greater. It's sad, yes, but in such a fantastic way. <BR>My favorites are &quot;Paper Tiger,&quot; which swells and builds in hypnotic waves, and &quot;Lost Cause,&quot; where Beck manages to seem resigned and resentful and sympathetic all at once. <BR>How can anyone not appreciate Beck's incredible range? He's already explored a range of musical genres, including pop, rock, country, electronic and hip hop. Now, here, we're seeing a deeper range of emotion then we've previously seen. I can't wait to see what Beck does next.
0316666343|4.0|The first several chapters of this book are touching, heartbreaking, and also hilarious. Susie's intitial descriptions of &quot;her heaven&quot; are spiced with a 14 year-old's imagination and cynicism. However, the story gradually loses some of it's opening orginality and freshness. Still a great read.
B00008OLYN|4.0|Damnation is not as good as the other Opeth releases, but is different because it has a lighter sound. There is no doubt in my mind that Opeth is one of the most talented metal acts, but they probably will never again produce another great album like &quot;Morningrise&quot; or &quot;Still Life&quot; again. After their release Deliverance, the band should have set more time aside for new material. &quot;Damnation&quot; is still a good CD, but not great.
0440236738|4.0|Coben has once again written an intricately complicated and ultimately surprising plot. Although not as gripping as _Tell No One_, _Gone for Good_ is entertaining and keeps the suspense at a fairly high level. <br />  A couple of caveats, though. Coben's protagonist is a bit too wimpy to be really sympathetic. This may be a personal dislike, but when the hero is more than a little pathetic, it's hard to care much about him. I personally would probably have liked the book better if it had been written from Squares's or even the Ghost's point of view. (Squares is the obligatory tough-guy sidekick and the Ghost is an inconsistently sociopathic hitman.) On the plus side, the complex plot keeps the novel interesting and makes the character's flaws less distracting. <br />  A second slightly negative note: The plot, although far-fetched, is amusing enough to justify the reader's suspension of disbelief--until the epilogue. Coben just can't resist throwing in one last twist, but he'd have been better off leaving well enough alone. The last so-called surprise is not entirely unexpected, but Coben fails to demonstrate that it makes any difference to the presumed future of his characters, so it feels like a cheap shot. <br />  This novel is fun to read, but don't analyze it too closely--just enjoy the ride.
B00005YW4H|5.0|&quot;Come Away With Me&quot; is an exceptional work for many reasons:  The song lyrics are poetry, set to music;  The music is complex, but sounds deceptively simple;  Norah Jones has a beautiful voice and each selection can stand on its own as a solid piece of work.  <br />After hearing the CD, I thought, &quot;Now I know what velvet SOUNDS like!&quot;  Norah Jones' phrasing is wonderful.  At different times, she sounds a bit like Billie Holliday, Judy Collins or Doris Day.  (Each of which are known for their great phrasing.)  Some songs are earthy, some are blues-y, and some have great ethnic music undertones.  Many of the songs are sung with a purity of voice that you don't hear much these days.  I find the music almost haunting and I find myself wanting to listen to the CD over and over.  <br />I have recommended this CD to everyone I know as a &quot;must have.&quot;  When you play it: Get comfortable, find a beverage, sit back, relax and ENJOY!
B000089RVX|2.0|I thought I would like this CD, but then when I got it, all of the songs are very slow and melancholy, and they make me depressed. I only really like one or two songs on the whole album...bummer.
B00008NRLX|5.0|Rainy Day Music once again proves that the Jayhawks are the best alt-country act recording today.  For those of you, like me, who love the Beatles, the Byrds, Simon and Garfunkle, CSNY, Dylan etc, Rainy Day Music is a light in the dark.  Forever the Green Grass was my previous favorite album, and this is probably better.  It showcases what the Jayhawks do best--perfect harmonies, clever acoustical guitar, and meaningful lyrics.<BR>  It is so rare any more to find a CD that has even a couple of good songs.  When you put this one in and hit play, the first half of the album will amaze you. One great song after another.  Yes, some of the songs in the second half do drag, but it's still good.  Give it a try and you will find new music that you will be hard pressed to take out of your stereo.  A masterpiece from an excellent band.
B000069HK2|5.0|Great music! Go buy it! It has very good rock music. Maybe even emo. I don't know. Anyways...My favorites: &quot;The Taste of Ink,&quot; Buried Myself Alive,&quot; &quot;A Box Full of Sharp Objects,&quot; &quot;Blue and Yellow,&quot; On My Own,&quot; and the bonus track (It's called &quot;Choke Me,&quot; right?) Anyways...The whole CD is good, but those are the ones I love! Pick this up, you won't rejegret it.
B00005JL78|5.0|Yes, the movie's a little long, but it's been a while since I've seen a sci-fi futuristic movie that kept me guessing for so long. I'm not saying it's the best movie ever, but if you're looking for a way to pass a lazy evening, this'll keep you way happy. There's enough plot twists and action scenes to keep anyone happy.
B000060P79|4.0|It has some good songs. \\"I'd Do Anything,\\" \\"I'm Just a Kid,\\" \\"God Must Hate Me,\\" \\"You Don't Mean Anything,\\" etc. But NOT \\"Addicted.\\" THAT SONG [IS BAD]. Mark Hoppus from Blink 182 appears on this CD (\\"I'd Do Anything.\\") and so does Joel Madden from Good Charlotte (\\"You Don't Mean Anything.\\") Pierre Bouvier is like...[an imitation Tom]... Anyways...Without these two guest appearances, the CD would be very weak!
B00000JMOJ|2.0|This movie is a typical Arnold 80's flick. Bad acting, loads of action, and God awful one-liners that you have to crack a smile at.  This film does do a major injustice to the story that was original written by Rich Bachman/Stephen King. The book was far more a better story to be told. Ben Richards was no wrongly convicted criminal but a desperate man trying to save his family, a sick and dying child and a wife who sells who body so the family can have money. The story goes way more into the corruption of the government and Ben Richards adventure is breathtaking while Arnold's Ben is just boring and predictable. If you are interested in this idea for a story don't waste time with the film, it shouldn't even use the same title as the book because they are only two things that both have. A main character named Ben Richards and a corrupt government controlled gameshow that kills the contestants. Read the book, skip the movie.
6300216039|5.0|This was no typical love story, and a very good remake from the play. However, I was amazed at how many lines were cut out from the play and put into the movie. This was effective because the play may get boring for viewers sometimes because of all the un-necessary lines. The plot was very good, excellent in fact. Zefirelli did an outstanding job directing and the duel between Romeo and Tybalt was well choreographed. But... At the end I was kind of dissapointed because the movie had cut out a good part that the play had in it. I won't tell you the moment because it's a spoiler. Oh well... Enjoy the movie.

1577311523|5.0|The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle is a very clear presentation of how to end pain and suffering by bringing a fuller spritual dimension into ones life.  This material has helped me to connect with the Love that is all around me.  It has also helped me understand the deep spiritual meaning of the Bible.  I hope this will help heal the pain and suffering of the world.
6305014140|5.0|If anyone has seen the Animatrix short titled \\"Training Program\\", they are likely to enjoy this movie. There is nothing like adventures in old world, feudal Japan. This anime has ikeable characters and a slew of some really great villains. Jubei, our wandering mercenary ninja, is the lead character role looking for a way in the world and some jobs to earn some money. He also, like most Japanese heroic characters, shows a sense of nobility, in that the one chance he has to save himself, he refuses for the sake of honoring a woman. (Id tell more but it deals with the plot). Only real problem is that it has nudity and some lude sexual scenes, but this isn't intended for review by children. I give it straight 5 stars for intense martial arts action, brilliantly smooth animation, and characters who, despite being slightly underdeveloped, are likeable. Good first anime for anyone who doesnt mind a little animated nudity.
B000002KHY|5.0|These compositions are excellent, even if you may have a problem with Taylor's nasal whine of a voice. He was one of the most successful folkies or singer/songwriters of the early 1970s - not only did he have huge hits with Carolina In My Mind, Something In The Way She Moves, Fire And Rain and Sweet Baby James, but Carole King took his song You've Got A Friend to number one. Poetic lyrics and sensitive, though sometimes complex, melodies made for a distinctive style and Taylor could also rock out as demonstrated by Steamroller. My favourite song is Fire And Rain with its enigmatic and evocative lyrics - it's been covered by hundreds of other artists, some sounding better than the original. I rate Taylor's composing skills higher than his singing, but this is a great and enjoyable collection of songs.
B0000931OG|2.0|This proves that Graham Coxon was Blur creative core and Damon basically the mouthpiece.  It also proves that Gorillaz drained Damon's energy, resulting in many of the droning beat-box dirges on this release.  This highlights the band's comedown mode with plenty of druggy references, uninventive lyrics (oooh, &quot;Crazy Beat&quot;), and a bizarre Arabic backdrop not cleverly targeted to the post-9/11 listener.  If Damon thinks he's now some world-music guru like Peter Gabriel having been to Mali and Morocco he's mistaken.  I propose getting Damon and Justine back together, as this one makes &quot;13&quot; seem like a party record.  Unlike all other Blur CDs (and I've got pretty much all of them) this one's heading to my shelf if not the used record bin.
B0000931OG|1.0|Since the departure of Mr Coxon, Blur has lost a lot<BR>of their edge and focus. The last song, which does<BR>feature Coxon, is the lone bright spot in this<BR>musical sea in search of a boat. Blur as a band is<BR>dead, pity. Check out older Blur titles before this.<BR>Crazy Beat featuring Damon's rudimentary guitar is<BR>a joke, as is most of the CD. Buyer beware.<BR>1 star for &quot;Battery in My Leg&quot; O stars for<BR>the rest
B00006DEF9|5.0|How could this movie be put into words? Mezmorizing? Charming? Phenomenal? All these and more. Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds are fabulous. This new version has incredible color, sound and picture quality. This is a  classic muscial that will be enjoyed by many many more generations. I do love the new sci-fi movies with all the hi-tech effects and sound but even those can't surpass a movie classic like this one.
6305127638|5.0|Even numbered Trek films are known to be better, and this eighth installment isn't an exception.  Jonathan Frakes makes his feature film directorial debut here which finds Captain Picard and crew journeying back in time to stop the Borg from altering history and assimilating Earth.  Patrick Stewart gives his best performance as Picard ever, while Alice Krige is both seductive and terrifying as the Borg Queen.  The special effects are top notch, and the Borg look scarier and more grotesque than they ever have before.  This is undoubtadly the best Trek film to feature the Next Generation crew, and Frakes' nice balance of humor, action, suspense, and horror make Star Trek: First Contact one of the best films in the series.  Even though the DVD itself is in desperate need of being re-released with extras worthy of the film, the picture and audio quality is unbelieveably top notch and looks and sounds great on home theater systems.
B000002KGT|3.0|After listening to \\"Tusk\\", \\"Fleetwood Mac\\", \\"Mirage\\" and even their newest album sans Christine McVie, \\"Say You Will\\", \\"Rumours\\" sounds very blah. If it weren't for Lindsay Buckingham's songs, which are by far the strongest, I'd would say this album is very average.<br />Lindsay's highlights (and the best cuts on the album) are \\"Go Your Own Way\\" which concludes with a thundering avalanche of a guitar solo; \\"Chain\\" (which I admit, is a collaborative effort)that highlights Lindsay's underrated versatility as a guitarist; the rolickingly-fun \\"Second Hand News\\" and the spritely-played \\"Never Going Back Again\\". These all pointed to the greatness that he brought to Mac's game.<br />Stevie Nicks contributes the next best set of songs, with \\"Gold Dust Woman\\" being the best. It conjures up the mystical images so often associated with Nicks.<br />And here is where I diverge from the crowd. I think Christine McVie's overall work here is weak; her lush voice and beautiful arrangements only striking a chord with the minimalist \\"Songbird\\". \\"Oh, Daddy\\" and \\"You Make Loving Fun\\" are good but not great. McVie does much better work on the other albums listed above. \\"Don't Stop\\" is by far the weakest cut on the album in my humble opinion, very much pop junk.<br />Overall, \\"Rumours\\" gives the listener and good run for their money and shouldn't be discounted in any way, shape or form. Hey, 20 million people can't be too wrong. But for more interesting listening try their bold follow-up album, \\"Tusk\\" or even \\"Mirage\\", where their pop sensibilities are front and center.
B000020617|3.0|Now don't get me wrong, I like this cd, and I love the Foo Fighters, but I just can't understand how people keep giving this 5 stars. It just doesn't deserve it. <br />STACKED ACTORS - (7/10) the first time I heard this song I thought it was terrible, and I refused to listen to it for weeks. Now I think it's one of the best on the album, a great opening riff, and I can't stop singing the chorus. <BR>BREAKOUT - (9/10) this ranks probably in my top 3 favorite Foo's songs, I can't get over how good this is. <BR>LEARN TO FLY - (8/10) I liked this song a lot when I first heard it, but it is overplayed, and it should rock out more, instead of being so mellow. note - it is much better live<BR>GIMMIE STITCHES - (7/10) different from most Foo's stuff, the lyrics kind of grossed me out at first hearing them, but the song is ok. <BR>GENERATOR - (4/10) no matter how much people talk about how great this song is, I can never get into it. Too mellow, and I don't like the melody. <BR>AURORA - (6/10) the first real ballad on the cd, but there are much better ones later. Aurora also lasts way too long to be good. <BR>LIVE-IN SKIN - (2/10) no matter how many times I listen to this cd, I simply can not remember this song. For me, that qualify's as horrible. The point is to write songs that people will remember. 100% Filler. <BR>NEXT YEAR - (7/10) I love this song, it is a great ballad, and it is beautiful, BUT the one problem is it goes on for WAY WAY to long, saying &quot;i'll be coming home next year&quot; and it gets very boring. <BR>HEADWIRES - (2/10) another song that I can't remember. <BR>AIN'T IT THE LIFE - (2/10) see above<BR>M.I.A. - (8/10) this song is great, it is slow, and the melody is great, I couldn't stop humming the &quot;you won't find me, I'm going M.I.A.&quot; for weeks. <br />All in all, I actually would recommend this record to most people, especially if they are less into hard rock or punk and more into the soft rock kind of thing. I just wish that there was notso much filler on the record. Both &quot;The Colour and the Shape&quot; and &quot;One By One&quot; are better than this, and I would recommend them both before it.
B00001MXXH|5.0|John Hughes has a knack for realistically portraying the oppression and dull experiences which take place in a public school setting.<br />While the drone of the lecturing teacher (played by Ben Stein) and the bored, glazed over eyes, and distraction of the students is supposed to be a caricature, it's actually quite realistic. It is so realistic that is hilarious.<br />Also realistic is the degree to which teenagers are grossly underestimated for their natural intelligence and their desire to truly learn.<br />Ferris lies and fakes his own illness in order to skip school, and Principal Rooney believes that Ferris is off sleeping with his girlfriend, or playing video games. Ferris, on the other hand, is off to a museum, dining at fine food restaurants, creatively participating in a parade. His friends learn a lot from him about branching out and daring to go against the grain, to expand your horizons and live your life.<br />There are many funny moments, but, like The Breakfast Club, it makes a point of showing what kids really need, and being jailed in intellectually dulling classrooms is not it. Anyone who is a fan of organic learning will be sure to get a kick out of this one.
6305842442|3.0|There has been much discussion over which version of Blade Runner is the best. I have to say that, although I like the director's cut, it is the original version that really captured my heart and imagination. First of all, the narration made Blade Runner into a futuristic version of the old black and white private eye films. This gave the movie a GREAT retro feeling and in my opinion revealed more about Deckard's character than the director's cut was able to. Secondly, the director's cut really seems to go out of its way to drive home the point that Deckard is a replicant as well. I don't think that made the movie any stronger or better, it just made it &quot;different&quot;. Rather than a human who finds love in a replicant and learns that you don't have to be a real person to be human in the original, you have a replicant who doesn't know he's one killing replicants and the numerous issues that go along with that. Anyway, if the franchise wants to really make some money, they should release an ULTIMATE EDITION BLADE RUNNER DISC SET with BOTH versions on DVD. They would satisfy everyone, and give people a chance to see both versions and judge for themselves which is best.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|Fleetwood Mac's Say You Will is the first album of entirely new songs to feature Lindsey Buckingham since 1987's Tango In The Night.  Unfortunately, Christine McVie decided to sit this one out, so it is not a complete reunion of the most successful version of the band.  The album's genesis had its place a few years ago when drummer Mick Fleetwood and bassist John McVie played on some tracks Mr. Buckingham was recording for a planned solo album.  The collaboration felt right and the solo project was put on hold for a band reunion that was captured on the live album The Dance and a subsequent tour.  Say You Will is a sprawling eighteen track album that is divided equally, nine songs apiece for Mr. Buckingham and singer Stevie Nicks.  It is great to have an abundance of new material, but the results are uneven.  There are some standout tracks like the first single \\"Peacekeeper\\" and the title track which harkens back to the band's glory days of the late 70's.  Mr. Buckingham's guitar work is some of the best he's ever recorded as he lets loose throughout the album, notably on a track like \\"What's The World Coming To\\".  Overall, Ms. Nicks' songs, like the beautiful \\"Ilume\\" and \\"Silver Girl\\", turn out to be stronger than Mr. Buckingham's, whose best efforts include \\"Red Rover\\" & \\"Miranda\\".  Some tracks really don't work, like the overblown \\"Murrow Turning Over In His Grave\\", the drippy \\"Destiny Rules\\" and the too long \\"Come\\".  Despite the flaws, Say You Will is a welcome comeback from the band and a very good album.  The band try to explore some new ground, while stay rooted in the sound that works best for them.  Hopefully they will not wait another sixteen years to record together again.
0316286443|5.0|I guarante you will look at this book more than once. I must admit it's more celebrity oritented than &quot;Making Faces&quot; and the directions for applications don't come with as many sketches , but the fabulous photography and the different looks are worth a 5 star rating.
0783225725|4.0|\\"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\\" is a slightly better film than \\"High Plains Drifter.\\"  However, Eastwood is almost upstaged by Eli Wallach in that classic Spaghetti Western.  In \\"High Plains Drifter,\\" what you get is the quintessential, undiluted \\"Man with No Name\\" character, with all the mayhem and intimidation that comes with it.<br />The story is interesting and contains an important moral point about cowardice and conformity.  The film ends with a ghostlike eerieness, which Eastwood used again in \\"Pale Rider\\" several years later.  In summary, \\"High Plains Drifter\\" offers an excellent alternative to the countless run-of-the-mill westerns produced over the years.
0316286850|5.0|I think out of all Kevyn's books, I like this one the most. The beggining of the book gives you an informative look at the different parts of makeup such as blush, fondation, and eyebrows. I liked how this book came with a lot of sketches and step-by-step instructions.
6304675348|4.0|SCREAM is an ultimate horror film for anyone who loves superlative acting, a well-written script, and exciting thrills, scares, and schocks! All of the actors and actresses had great stage chemistry and really knew there parts. The script was clever, twisting, and thought-provoking. I write movie and television scripts, so, this coming from a screenwriter herself, this movie had a wonderful playwright! There were also many scares and shocks, like when...well...I'll leave you to watch them! ^o^<br />The only thing I thougt could've been better was the storyline. Well, they got the basic plot that Sidney's mother was killed and now she is afraid the killers might not have been locked away and are out to kill her and her friend's on her mom's death's anniversary. That is a good starter, but I think the plot could've had more details to it. Like telling about her mother's life, and Sidney's childhood, etc. <BR>I definitly reccomend this movie to anyone who likes a good scare! I've never seen Scream 2 or 3 but I will get them soon!! Till then I advise you to get this movie...never open the door...never answer the phone...and when all else fails...SCREAM!
B000002J09|4.0|Despite what many people think, John Paul Jones plays the mandolin on this and every other Zeppelin album, not Jimmy Page. For example, from what I hear, there are are no overdubs in &quot;Battle of Evermore.&quot; If there are, then they are guitar overdubs, not the mandolin. Jones is playing it, with Page on guitar, and Plant and Sandy Denny singing. The mandolin is a critical part of the recording and was needed for Plant and Denny to keep with the song.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Bravo! Finally a great movie musical , After years of bad ones such as Evita and Moulin Rouge we finally got Chicago. Everything about the movie is perfection every little thing has been totally brushed up and the results are one of the finest cinematic musicals in history. By far the best musical movie since West Side Story this is a great film.
B00000JGHM|5.0|Michael Mann's hand can be felt all over this movie.  I mean, we grew up with Miami Vice and then Crime Story, so the groundwork was well-laid.  But you never get the sense at any point in any one of his movies (up until \\"Ali\\") that the director doesn't have a clue.<br />...  The acting is first rate (although Pacino often throws a bit too much ham onto the plate), the script is fantastic, the pace, conviction, editing are all brilliant, and the musical score (various artists) is perfectly suited throughout.<br />Truly a 5-star movie, extras or no extras.  This is why you buy it on DVD; because it will stand the test of time.
B000002JSV|5.0|Back in Black is the mainstream choice, but this is the best old school AC/DC album hands down.  It's more of a groove album than the traditional balls to the wall/straight riff record for an AC/DC album. That is not to say there aren't riffs galore on here, because there are, it's AC/DC.  Highway To Hell is a close second, but this takes it.  I have no idea why more people don't give this album it's due.  Check it out.
B000001ELR|4.0|When explaining to people why I loved KISS, it's necessary to point out that I'm talking about a specific period--the three years between '76-79 when they were at their zenith.  But even after the hype stopped, even as the band slipped into neutral, you can hear a certain amount of inspiration in some of their 80s output.<br />This is where it starts.  \\"Creatures...\\" marked a heavier, more metallic sound due to the creative talents of Eric Carr (more rock oriented than P. Criss,) and Vinnie Vincent, who co-wrote a number of tunes on the album.  The title track would be used by the band in concert for many years, although \\"War Machine\\", \\"I Love It Loud\\", \\"Rock and Roll Hell\\" and \\"Danger\\" are all excellent even in retrospect.<br />The creativity would dry up by the mid-eighties, but this album along with \\"Lick It Up\\" and \\"Animalize\\" represent the cream of KISS during a very tough season in hair-band hell.
6303257844|5.0|\\"Speed\\" is, by far, one of the best action thrillers I have ever seen. It's use of thrills, suspense, humor, and romance makes this the perfect all-around movie.<br />The film revolves around Jack (Keanu Reeves), a member of the S.W.A.T. team, who gets involved with a madman bomber whom he thought had died years earlier when one of his bomb attacks went bad - an excellent suspenseful elevator scene by the way. The bomber, played hauntingly well by Dennis Hopper, has placed a bomb on a bus in the middle of Los Angeles. If that weren't bad enough, if the bus drops below 50 mph, the bomb will explode. It is up to Jack, with the help of Annie (Sandra Bullock), to bring all of the passengers to safety and stop the madman.<br />This is one film that will keep you on the edge of your seat and will leave you wanting more. This is also one of the few films where Keanu Reeves portrays a real action hero (long before the Matrix films were released), doing it very well. I would highly recommend this film! You won't be disappointed!!!
B00005MNP7|4.0|Though Blondie was much more a singles band, this was the one time they pulled it all together to make a near perfect album.  Right out of the gate, &quot;Dreaming&quot; is just blinding, and reminds you of how powerful you can feel when hearing a great song.  From there, they just keep going, except for two stumbles:  &quot;Eat To The Beat&quot; and &quot;Victor&quot; don't really work, but that's okay.  Two more incredible moments on a stellar record:  &quot;Slow Motion&quot;, and then the majestic &quot;Atomic&quot;.  Near the end when Debbie sings, &quot;Oooohh, make it mag-ni-fi-cent...tonight...maybe tonight...&quot; it just gives me chills.  To be sure, they had amazing songs after this (&quot;Call Me&quot;, &quot;Rapture&quot;), but no album reached these dizzy heights.  Now if they'd just re-release the &quot;Eat To The Beat&quot; video album on DVD...
1577311523|2.0|...Tolle's teaching is in places insightful, mystical, yet with strong under currents of New Age mumbo jumbo followed by periods that are absurd, eccentric and falling into gibberish. I believe Tolle has had some genuinely mystical experiences in his life. He is a very sincere and well intentioned fellow. However, his problems arise once he has attempted to interpret that mystical experience; to reduce it to a psychological formula for enlightenment.  Tolle is a perfect example of the delusions that arise from an intellectual interpretation of the mystical.  A classic pitfall.Here are a few of the core errors Tolle has made:<br /><br />1) The core of Tolle's teachings centers around being present in the moment in order to free oneself of suffering. Tolle sees the past and future as time, and the present as timeless. This is a fundamental and foundational mistake which, unfortunately, skews the rest of his teachings. Why? The truth is that past, present, and future are all of time. The present, the now in that sense, is not outside of time. By mentally drawing your attention to the present, you are merely focusing on a different aspect of time. This does not bring about freedom, but rather simply shifts one's attention. ***The now, the state of timelessness referred to by the mystics over the centuries is *beyond* past, present, and future. It enters into realms which extends far beyond mental games.<br /><br />2) The core of Tolle's ***partial*** mystical realization, which I believe is genuine, took place during a time of suicidal crisis. Tolle experienced a profound act of Grace which led him to the spiritual life.  It was given freely, not based on any doing by Tolle.  Yet Eckhart ignores this fact in his teachings to you which are all about do this, do that, free yourself.  This is a grave oversight on his part.<br /><br />3) Tolle has grossly, and with grandiosity, over estimated the potential benefits of focusing on oneself in the moment via a mental technique. There are many other mistakes made by Tolle, yet there's simply no more room in this review to go into them.<br /><br />Now we come to the just plain eccentric:<br /><br />1) Tolle believes that women and gays are inherently more able to realize enlightenment than heterosexual men. I can assure you, God holds no such prejudice.<br /><br />2) Eckhart says that the discomfort of a women's menstrual cycle is caused by centuries of poor treatment by men. This is way off the map.<br /><br />3) He believes all animals are completely free of negativity in any form unless they've spent time with humans. Just silly.  Dolphins at times have violent battles with other dolphins.  Grizzly bears will kill a mother's cubs in order to mate with her.  The list goes on and on.<br /><br />Tolle's book is ok. It certainly, in PLACES, rises  above the general absurdity of New Age literature. When compared to that lot, Tolle's book is ok. However, that is setting a rather low standard.  Check out J. Krishnamurti, the Dalai Lama, the later years of Thomas Merton or any of the great spiritual texts of the world for a much more solid and grounded teaching.er mistakes made by Tolle, yet there's simply no more room in this review to go into them.

B00004YRQA|5.0|Sony makes the highest quality of home entertainment products that are desgined to work together. If you save a few bucks and buy some el cheapo memory card, you may lose all your data at any given time and that sucks if you have 40+ hours on Final Fantasy X or a full season on Madden 2003.<br />Stick with Sony, you won't be sorry.
6302814359|5.0|A young boy joins a club, wich has only two bullies as the earlier members. When he discovers that the clubhouse is the crypt chamber on an old cemetery, he flees in fear. The two bullies quikly finds him along with an canister containing the horrendous gas that caused the events in the original.<BR>The two bullies later return to take closer look on the barrel and of course they accidently release the toxic gas from the barrel. The dangerous fumes hits the graveyard and hell brakes loose. The corpses crawl out of their graves, hungry for BRAAAIINSSS!!! Soon the undead is all over the town and it's up to a group of survivours to find out how to make the living dead dead agiain. Wich is easier said than done since these zombies are more thougher and faster than regular zombies.<br />A really funny film. More humor than in the first one, and bringing back the actors from the original was true genius. I think this is the best of all three. Since the original was a bit more serious and part 3 wasn't very mutch of a ROTLD movie at all. So if you have good sense of humor and love horrorfilms with a touch of comedy, then I strongly recomend it. I loved it.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|This movie was in one word \\"Terrible.\\" I watched the movie after having read the book and was utterly disappointed. Apparently Simon Wells (the director) had no intention to preserve the plot of the book. He added characters (Emma) and changed the appearance of the Eloi - just to name a few minor details. In addition to the disparities between the book and the plot, the appearance of the Morlocks in the movie was almost fake (think Congo). The only bright spots in the movie were the acting of Jeremy Irons (Uber-Morlock) and the beautiful women - Sienna Guillory and Samantha Mumba. Not only would I not go buy a ticket in the movie theater to rent this, I wouldn't even rent it on video. I think there are other versions which I understand are better.
B00007GRCG|5.0|There are so many features that make this incredible edition of \\"Fever\\" the ONLY version to own, I don't know where to begin.  Here's a brief breakdown:<br />-The US radio editions of the singles, most notably the rare and almost-impossible-to-find Ruff & Jam version of \\"Love At First Sight\\"<br />-The B-sides \\"Good Like That\\" , \\"Baby\\" , \\"Can't Get Blue Monday Out Of My Head\\" , \\"Whenever You Feel Like It\\" , and \\"Tightrope\\"<BR>These are all really excellent, and deserved to be on the album the first time around.<br />-The remixes are kind of hit-and-miss in my opinion, but the good ones are really on the mark.<br />-The videos for all four singles from the album (\\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\" , \\"In Your Eyes\\" , \\"Love At First Sight\\" , and \\"Come Into My World\\")<br />Even though it is a bit expensive, it is worth it to have all of this on 2 CDs.  Get it now!!!
B000088E6D|4.0|Once in long while, a great talent emerges in the world of Popular Song. Michael Bubl is one of them. For someone so young, he is astonishlingly comfortable with the Jazz-inflected rhythms of the 40s and 50s. Granted the selection of songs is tailored to showcase Bubl's range and versatility, something like the rockin' and rollin' Crazy Little Thing Called Love has really no place here. And Barry Gibb's Bee Gees style backing vocals is really too gimmicky for the beautifully lamented How Can You Mend A Broken Heart. For the sake of Bubl's Art of Crooning (and my personal collection), I hope he will in future be more critical with his choice of songs. His singing is really a breath of fresh air in today's world of misguided choices.
B00008OLYN|5.0|This album is truly a work of art, blowing the doors off heavy metal convention and catapulting Opeth to the top of the rock and roll universe. As many believe, Opeth is the worlds greatest band. You must buy this album! I've played the album maybe 8 times and every time i say track 1 is the best song, then track 2 plays, and I say it is the best, etc., etc. If i had the money I would burn CD's of Damnation and just leave em at the bank, the library,  restaurants, etc, with no labeling and people would die to find out who makes this awe inspiring music. But then they would also buy Blackwater Park and they would get very frightened!
B000000WCA|4.0|The Spice Girls were fantastic on their debut album Spice. The album is very dancable and great. Lyrically it has no deph or originality but hey is not supposed to be like that. <br />It has 10 great pop tunes that are well written and produced. Their voices are also good. It also has a great wibe to the whole thing. Though you hate or love them you can´t deny that some of these songs are fantastic.<br />Released in 1996 this album became a huge smash all over the world. The Spice Girls were everywhere. In all the magazines, on radio and on MTV the world were turned upside down by them. <br />This album topped the charts in 33 countries and sold over 26 million copies worldwide. It contained 5 smash hits and made the spice Girls the biggest pop phenomenon ever. However they never made another album like this one and in twenty years this remains a pop classic.
B00006L9ZT|5.0|Technically, I'd prefer to give this 4 1/2 stars. This rendition is not perfect, but it is far better than some of my fellow reviewers would have you believe. I own Rheingold and Walk&uuml;re in DVD, and have seen Siegfried and G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung on VHS. I'll be adding the latter two to my collection as money permits. I have watched the entire cycle now twice. I would like to see the Bayreuth/Boulez production, but no library around my home area has them.<br />About the only criticisms I agree are (1) Behrens sometimes seems under-powered for the role; (2) the acting is sometimes less than dramatically powerful. I was also initially disappointed that there are no real horses in the Ride of the Valkyries, or the conclusion of G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung. (There is a local Christian theater that uses live animals on its stage; why wouldn't the greatest opera house in the world be able to do it?)<br />In defense of Behrens, at least she isn't fat or ugly. She convincingly protrays a beautiful warrior-maid who surrenders herself to human love only to be betrayed. I could go on at length about the artistic virtues of each of the other major characters; suffice it to say that they are all world-class. Morris as Wotan and Hagen (sorry, don't have the actor's name at hand) are especially powerful and convincing; Jerusalem as Loge and Siegfried is almost as good. Contrary to at least one other reviewer, Act I of Walk&uuml;re (the meeting and elopement of Sieglinde and Siegmund) is well-done by Norman and Lake, respectively.<br />The dramatic flaws are more than made up for by the intimacy allowed by television: the good-bye between Wotan and Br&uuml;nnhilde (end of Walk&uuml;re) is over-whelming; the reforging of Notung, the double oath sworn on Hagen's spear by Br&uuml;nnhilde and Siegfried, and their love scene at the end of Siegfried, are just some of the highlights that come to mind as powerful, moving...(add your favorite adverb of artistic excellence).<br />Whatever the virtues of the Bayreuth DVD production, I think that any person who wants to enjoy, appreciate, and understand Wagner's Ring owes it to himself/herself to see a traditional production. I will continue to enjoy the Met Ring for years to come.roduction, I think that any person who wants to enjoy, appreciate, and understand Wagner's Ring owes it to himself/herself to see a traditional production.

1400034779|3.0|I'm sorry...but comparing this main character to Uncle Abner and Judge Dee is a real stretch...this is an OK book, but I don't think it will stand the test of time anywhere near as well as the Abner and Dee mysteries.  It's &quot;light.&quot;
B000002B30|4.0|as a springsteen fan i can't believe they call this his best work! Yes Born in the USA and Dancing in the dark are great hits <BR>but for example my Hometown left me thinking. and where is tunnel of love? surely they don't think Brilliant disquise is better than that. And i also have to agree that putting new songs on the album isn't so good as well. Sure i like This hard land and murder inc but those aren't his best work. I think this CD is quikly put together and that really puts me of.I only give it four stars because it's his name on the cover of the CD. So don't waste your'e time and buy a good album like Tunnel of Love or Born to Run.
B0000019PA|1.0|As the keystone Elephant 6 band and a much heralded indie CD, NMHs most popular album deserved attention. And while faithful NMH fans will hate me for stating the obvious, nonetheless my reaction is: there is little here beyond catchy guitars. In fact, the lyrics are nonsensical in the painful tradition of They Might Be Giants. In discussing this I have heard it argued that Jeff Mangum is working with very personal metaphors, but I don't see the value of indeciferable metaphors. Just as I'm not interested in James K. Polk (They Might be...) I'm also not interested in the king of carrot flowers; in fact, the lyrics are distracting.<BR>Additionally distracting is Mangums vocals, which people either seem to love or detest. I don't particularly care for them. At least we have less fuzz than his other work.<BR>Unfortunatly the indie kids running around with this stuff can't get past the mainstream bias to honestly critique what they were told is good by pitchfork and CMJ. How can some origionality make up for underachievement? <BR>Is Jeff still in Europe recording folk music? Quit slacking off Jeff and show us what you can do!
B000001Y2U|5.0|Buy this album.  That's all I have to say because this album will completely make you think differently IF YOU LISTEN.  This is Mr. Warner's foundation for everything that he believes (which is what I believe);)  <BR>Be forewarned, the music on this album is so loud and so sharp that it will leave you feeling very vulnerable.  There are a few tracks where the harshness is not so harsh (i.e. Cryptorchid, Mister Superstar, Kinderfeld, The Minute of Decay, Man That You Fear) but the other tracks will leave you feeling completely annihilated.  <BR>Yet, I do not believe that how the music itself will make you feel was Warner's true intent for \\"ACS\\".  Rather, his lyrics are the true meat of the album, each word carefully chosen to create in your mind, like he says, \\"an apocalypse\\".  If you don't believe me, read the lyrics which can be found on a great Manson fanpage \\"Songs of Golgotha\\".  There, you can read every lyric on the album to see what I mean.  <BR>Probably one of the best songs lyrically on \\"AcS\\" is \\"The Reflecting God\\".  If you are listening as a die-hard Born-Again Christian (which is what I used to be), the lyrics, IF YOU LISTEN, will cause you to seriously question your own faith (i.e. I went to God and I was looking at me/Saw heaven and hell were lies/When I'm God everyone dies...NO SALVATION (HA HA) NO FORGIVENESS (HA HA)) Said enough?  I'm telling you, Mr. Warner (which is his real name) puts it on the table as real as it comes and will either cause you to throw the album away or leave you begging for more (hopefully the latter).<BR>I heavily suggest purchasing this album for every aspect (the art, the music, the lyrics) simply because this is one of the greatest forms of American expression.  This is what an artist should do and Mr. Warner does it.  Two thumbs up!!!!!
B000002LND|3.0|What I find amusing is that many people proclaim this to be a greatest hits collection. If it is then its bad. If it is not then what is it. Well its a collection of Madonna songs that were popular in the 80s remastered in Q- sound or whatever. Some of the tracks are remixes. The problem is that if you look at this as a greatest hits recording then its so disapointing.Such tracks as Whos That Girl and more are missing not to mention that the first few tracks are edited and are not in their full versions. Like A Prayer is horrible remixed and this version as among the worst versions of the songs. Express Yourself is also diffrent from its original. The version of Vouge is longer and a bit boring. The two new songs are good.<BR>Overall this is a good album if you dont look at it as a greatest hits collection but if you do stay away.

B00008S2VG|4.0|I listened to Madonna when she released Ray of Light which I think is still the gold standard when it comes to her recent offerings. I bought American Life to add to my collection of Ray of Light &amp; Music. What I really liked about the album is that there is extensive use of guitars which is really good if you like that. I've been reading reviews of this latest offering &amp; it seems that reviews are mixed. But all I can say is that if you're not closed to one type of music, or if you're like me who likes techno, classical, folk, &amp; alternative music, or a mixture of those then get this album.

B00005JLEU|2.0|This may be one of the most over rated films in recent memory. I cannot believe the hype and hoopla touted by the higher ups about this inferior piece of mediocrity. Something is inheritedly wrong with A.M.P.A.S. when only three films are nominated for best achievement in an amimated feature and this truly inferior film wins. The animation was not as 'smooth' or as \\"animated\\" as any of the other nominees. It's just a case of \\"The Emperor's New Clothes.\\" Someone decided that this ws a great film and got all the rest of us excited about it, expecting something ephemeral and grand. Yet what we got was mediocre and banal. What a rip-off! I tried to watch this movie with a open mind on more than three occassions and each time the result was the same: I could not compel myself to stay awake. I am of the opinion that a film doesn't necesarilly have to be a bad film just because I don't like it, and vice versa, that just because like a film doesn't necessarilly mean it is a good film. But, I do pride myself on being fair and objective. That being said I am just sadenned by how a poor excuse for a \\"great film\\" can receive such acclaim. It's as if the critics were feigning a great love of this movie just so the they could appear more sensative in order to impress the \\"classy girl\\" in a college philosophy class. What a waste.
B0000203YT|3.0|Shakespeare in Love is entertaining as comedy and romance, but the big problem is the utter fictitiousness of the story.  Well it wasn't all fictional:  There was a man named William Shakespeare and he did write a play called \\"Romeo and Juliet\\", but other than that....<br />  So much effort (or money at least) was put into this film  (the sets and wardrobes are excellent Elizabethan recreations) that it all seems a bit of a waste.  The acting was competent, but two dimensional on the part of Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes.  Paltrow did get the accent down well (most viewers thought she was really British), but it felt like her heart really wasn't in the thing.  And I didn't believe for a second that Fiennes was Shakespeare.<br />  The story tells how Shakespeare has writers' block (does anyone really believe he ever had it?) while trying to write a play called \\"Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter\\".  Of course a major distraction from enjoying the film is that here William basically invents the play directly from his life at the time, based on his relationship with Paltrow (who initially is the actor of Romeo).  But reality tells us the fictional story of \\"Romeus and Juliet\\" goes back at least 100 years (from Italy) before this, and actually back over 1000 years (from Greece as \\"Pyramis and Thisbe\\").  The question is why did Stoppard ignore the historical reality to do this?<br />  What was good about the film was actually showing the play coming together, the rehearsals, all the way up to the debut performance, and if you know the play well these parts are interesting.  But we keep getting the distraction of this William-Viola parallel to the play, not to mention the Duke who keeps barging onto the scene.  I would've loved this if they stuck to historical fact...and perhaps got different actors.<br />  Finally Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth is good, but again her dialogue doesn't ring true.  I understand this was meant to be kind of a parody, but I think they went way overboard.<br />  At least there are some good sex scenes and the surreal \\"Twelfth Night\\" ending was well done also.I think they went way overboard. <br />     At least there are some good sex scenes and the surreal \\"Twelfth Night\\" ending was well done also.
B00005JM93|1.0|Irrversible is packed with sex and violence, which can usually be used quite well in cinema.  In this case there was way too much violence to cover up a weak directoral ability to depict plot.  For instance, there is a rape scene that last for about 3-5 minutes and I feel the graphic content of said does not add value to the movie.  I am a fan of action movies, and never shy away, but it was too much this time.
B000000H66|5.0|I think one of the first death metal songs i ever heard was \\"genetic reconstruction\\" from this band. Never cared for them at the time, but someone showed me this album, all I have to say is LET IT GROW ON YEA! I hated it at first, if you can get past his voice, this is amazing music, awsome guitars, leads, drummer is next best thing to slayer/pantera's drummers. Just amazing. Get this album, read the lyrics, bang your heads!
B00008S2VG|4.0|The album offers more in terms of melody, electro-chic, and more importantly, pop hooks that we thought Madonna has forgotten how to write. Hearing \\"American Life\\", you know she's left Evita far, far behind, and woken up from the new age schlock of \\"Ray of Light\\" (surely the most over-rated Madonna album ever). <br />\\"American Life\\" returns Madonna to the synth-pop of the early 80s, but post-electroclash, and post-Madonna-the- guitar-strummer. So while a lot of the elements from \\"Music\\" remain, they follow a different aesthetic -- lean, insistent synth lines are favored over bossy basslines; blunt, sqelchy beats are replaced by tight, brittle ones. You'll also find guitar jangles employed more liberally, in a way that makes this version of electroclash Madonna's own. <br />At the center of the album, like caramel coated in bitter chocolate, oozes three of the sweetest love ballads Madonna has penned ever: \\"Nothing Fails\\", \\"Intervention\\", \\"X-Static Process\\". Her singing has genuine feeling here -- \\"Nothing Fails\\", even without the choral finale, works as a poignant testament of love; \\"Intervention\\" has a chorus boybands would kill for.<br />For the uptempo numbers, \\"Hollywood\\" and \\"Mother and Father\\", while not outright dancefloor stompers, have that giggly, hum-along quality that characterizes the best of Madonna's pop moments (the fact that both songs have quite serious subject matters only make them more entertaining; Madonna trying to be serious is always entertaining).<br />Although I've kept referring to Madonna's past work, the best way to appreciate this album, is to come into it without baggage to listen to it as if Madonna is an artist you've never heard of before. Which, with every new album, she kind of is anyway.
0800177177|3.0|Yes, yes, hear me out.  While this was a visually stunning film, call me a fuddy-duddy for saying that it wasn't true to the book.  It was just twisted around enough for it to not make a lot of sense if you had read the book.  Maybe all those illiteracies in Hollywood have caught up to the big wigs, but there were scenes where I had to say, \\"I don't remember THAT ever happening\\".<br />Yes, the picture quality is marvelous.  The sound is great.  The special effects were amazing.  But if you're going to make a vampire movie and call it Dracula, don't have the monster being a womanizer with romantic intentions.<br />Hopkins is excellent as VanHelsing, the vampire hunter.  That alone is worth watching.
B00008S2VG|1.0|This cd s[tin]ks. Madonna sounds horrible, and the songs all sond the same \\"exception american life\\" that song is upbeat and all but the rap in it sounds so [bad]. Madonna just seemed predictable in that song like you knew each line before she sang it. She just rymed words without meening. The title is a failed attempt to get on the over done American theme, just to sell a cd. It is very empty, just listen to the lyrics. The best track on the cd is love profusion, it has the sound that you would expect from madonna. That song is the only reason that i gave this cd 1 star. Without that song this would be a zero if it was possible. This cd is a stienker, not a keeper, avoid!!
B00005R1N3|5.0|I am a huge fan of good scary movies,and this is a pretty good one.One of the first \\"slasher on the loose\\"movies,I think. Atmospheric,well-acted,touches of humor..just enough gore to creep you out,but not gross you out,and that's is a big difference!<br />If you like slasher movies,you will no doubt enjoy this one.
B000084T18|5.0|This CD is straight fire I like every song except Patiently Waiting.4 a debut cd it's very ... hot.This,C-Murder's 'Life Or Death' and Snoop's 'Doggystyle' are the best debut albums ever.50Cent got all in all 6 cd's but 5 are mixtapes.C-Murder and 50 Cent are the best rappers rightnow.My favourites are What Up Gangsta,Back Down,In Da Club,Wanksta,Blood Hound,Many Men,Heat,U Not Like Me,If I Can't,Gotta Make It To Heaven. It's real Hip Hop plus it sounds good.and if ya don't respect dat u should go buy a cd from dat ... Ja Rule.Ya Heard Me ?!
B000005HFH|4.0|Chet Baker's vocal techniques often left those listening wondering if they were hearing a man or a woman singing, but they are beautiful in their own little, androgynous way.  His voice is soft and wispy and maybe a little thin (he doesn't sound like a \\"trained\\" singer at times) but amazingly quiet and very soulful.<br />The album has a lot of quite ballads but a few good up-tempo swing tunes also.  Very mournful and beautiful and easy to listen to without being too sappy.  It's a cool west coast sound that is seemingly timeless.  The recording quality is excellent considering that all these tracks are from the 50's (when he was playing and singing at his best), but on some of the tracks there is a slight bit of \\"white noise\\" you can hear.  <br />His trumpet playing is great on these tracks.  He compliments his singing with his melodic, soft horn playing perfectly.
B00005JLWN|5.0|\\"Equilibrium\\" truly gives \\"The Matrix\\" a run for its money. It may not be as revolutionary, and it was certainly made on very limited coffers (in film terms, that is, with a budget of about twenty million dollars), but this movie nonetheless has it all: heart, soul, brains, and more than its fair share of visceral action. It is this combination of the dramatic, the cerebral, and the intense that makes \\"Equilibrium\\" one of the best action films of its kind, and one of the very best films released in 2002 (though Dimension, for whatever reason, opted for a limited release, which may be why you've never heard of it up until now).  <br />The always versatile and vastly talented Christian Bale plays John Preston, an emotionless enforcer (or Cleric) who arrests, and more often murders, those known as \\"Sense Offenders\\" - people who refuse to obey the laws of the futuristic regime, which has made illegal all forms of artistic expression, and even emotion itself. Emotion is regulated by daily drug use, and those who refuse to indulge are summarily executed. But when Preston kills his partner (played by Sean Bean, who so effortlessly portrayed Boromir in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\") for displaying unusual sentiment and misses his own required inducement of the emotion-quelling drug, he realizes that perhaps he is fighting for the wrong team.<br /> \\"Equilibrium\\" feels like John Woo's take on \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" or \\"Brave New World,\\" and it's absolutely astounding. Though at times \\"Equilibrium\\" may be guilty of mimicking \\"The Matrix,\\" it sometimes outshines its forebear, and is every bit as compelling, its world every bit as believable (if not more so). Like \\"The Matrix,\\" \\"Equilibrium\\" makes a powerful statement, and despite its splendidly choreographed action segments (which are revolutionary in their own right), it is a film with brains and brawn alike, and should not be missed. At last, despite all of its immitators, \\"The Matrix\\" has a worthy adversary in the genre.
6305508550|5.0|Anyone who has ever worked in corporate America will relate to this hilarious gem.<br />It is low key as opposed to slapstick comedy. I think the movie was well cast about a cube dweller who had enough and basically quits working and gets a promotion to upper management while his hard working and dedicated buddies get slated for layoffs by \\"The Bob's\\" two management consultants.<br />Ron Livingston does a great job as Pete Gibbons, and Ajay Naidu as \\"Samir Nu, ne, nunu, uh nnn ,not work here anymore\\" David Herman as Micheal-why should I change - Bolton.<br />The boss Lundbergh is played perfectly deadpan by Gary Cole, and I think there is a Tom Smykowski and Milton Waddams in every organization. Lets not forget the \\"Bob's\\" I knew two idiot consultants just like them.<br />Office Space has it all, from stupid meetings, CI programs, and of course the infamous TPS reports - \\"didn't you get the memo about the new cover sheets?\\"<br />I could not stop laughing through the whole thing.<br />Well worth the price of the DVD, even though the transfer was only fair.

0784011214|2.0|First Blood was a pretty good movie, and had a point. Rambo is an action movie for twelve-year-olds, and the script seems like it was written by one. It has all the subtlety of a speech by Ronald Reagan (Rambo's biggest fan), and all the relevance of a speech by Dubya Bush (Rambo's biggest legacy). <br />\\"They have our men, let's go kill 'em all!!\\"<br />Sure, intelligent people don't take their world views from popular entertainment, but last time I looked, the world was not populated chiefly by intelligent people, notice that?
B000083E79|5.0|Sure, \\"Believe\\" is the dance song everyone knows and loves, and it truly is a great track. But if it weren't for the club success of \\"One By One\\" in 1996, the \\"Believe\\" album would never have been made! I am really glad that the general public will finally be exposed to this wonderful dance track on this CD, the first time that the Junior Vasquez Club EDIT has been released. This song is the true gem of Cher's dance music career. As for the complilation itself, yes \\"Love and Understanding\\", \\"The Way of Love\\" and \\"We All Sleep Alone\\" are missing and this warranted a 2-disc set ... but reviewing what IS here, it's still a fantastic listen from beginning to end. One minor quibble: if \\"A Different Kind of Love Song\\" was chosen as one of the tracks, why did they chose the extremely lame Rodney Jerkins remix over the fantastic Lenny B remix (found on the maxi-single) or the wonderful \\"Living Proof\\" album version? This decision makes no sense at all.
0807261785|5.0|I purchased books 1-5 on audio tape to listen to with my children while driving in the car.  My how time flys when you are hearing about the perils of the Baudelaire children.  I notice traffic doesn't bother me half as much while I am listening to these stories. Somethings in life could be much worse than sitting in bumper to bumper traffic.<br />My children enjoy the stories so much that they don't just want to listen in the car anymore.  Every night before they go to bed we listen to about an hour of the tape. <br />Also, I think my children appreciate me more after they see what a hard life these children have. <br />I would recommend these stories for older children (older then 7). Younger or overly sensitive children might get scared or become upset by some of the things that happen.
0060512806|4.0|The middle-brows and genre lovers occasionally try to hoist one of the more impressive examples of their world up into the complex, literary sphere, invariably referring to whichever book it is as 'Pynchon, only funnier', 'with passages rivalling Delillo', or 'contains a vision as complete as Joyce or Shakespeare'.  These twee remarks are never true.  'The Lord of the Rings' has been elevated in such a way, as has 'Dune' and 'Foundation'.  Cryptonomicon, while being a brilliant novel with a plot of rare density and excitement, falls into this category.  It has its cult status and biblical praise, but in truth it is little more than the sum of its parts.<BR>    What Cryptonomicon has is a highly impressive, multilayered plot whose various strands move along with a laudable level of mystique, violence, and humour.  You begin with three mathematicians cycling in the woods and progress into an ever-increasing and ever-engrossing plotline which takes you from modern-day computer geekdom and the legal murk of cunning business deals back and forth through the entire span of World War 2, following an army sargeant and an eccentric, code-breaking genius along their independent, but occasionally intertwined, journey into one hell of a mystery.<BR>    The main characters and the hypnotic plot are what recommend this novel.  The genius code-breaker is a man of weird fascinations and his askew view of the world is consistently kept.  Shaftoe, the army sargeant, is a dry and self-reliant Vonnegutesque non-hero whose inability to get too wound up by the often ferocious events surrounding him grounds the war elements in a believeable reality.  Enoch Root, an officer and a cleric, is a semi-mystic who resembles the Cheshire Cat in Alice in Wonderland - another interesting character.  The book's plot is colossal and, while it stays in the WW2 plotline, is never boring. New threads are added unexpectedly and Stephenson rarely lets anything dangle or become moot, though when he does itserves as a cancer on a large part of the novel.  I will explain later.<BR>    The book is both aided and hindered by the writing.  By and large, the book is written adequately with frequent moments of real wit.  Stephenson can imbue a moment with real wonder and can create large theatres of action wherein nuances are paid attention to as well.  This doesn't happen enough, though.  There are sections that are written bluntly, coarsely, and without imagination.  They do not belong in a book of this ambition and weaken the power which had previous being building.  There are sections, most often in the contemporary plotline, which drag along blandly and add nothing to the experience but time.<BR>    The worst offence of all in this book is the ending.  The World War 2 plotlines end well and set up what the reader expects to be a profound climax.  No such thing occurs.  A very important antagonist is done away with out of the blue in less than a page, ending a plotline which was promising to be a razor-edge,  all-or-nothing climax for the computer geeks and their impossibly grand scheme.  A complex antecedent plot regarding a data haven near the Philippines becomes a predicate plot about a hunt for Nazi gold.  A terrible amount of anticipation fizzles out in the transition.  One is led to believe this gold will finance the data haven, but it's all left unsaid in a quick and painful wrap-up.<BR>    The ending stinks and makes one believe Stephenson was either told to end it as quickly as possible for publishing reasons or he tired of the whole thing and, instead of hiding this from his readership and pushing on, thus saving the novel, he gave in and ended it all in a way not a million miles away from 'He woke up and it was all a dream'.  <BR>    Nevertheless, this novel is, in the final analysis, an interesting novel with heaps of code-history and thought-provoking discussions, such as the conversation about Ares and Athena being complex metaphors for different approaches to war.  Read it, enjoy it, bite your tongue when it drags, read the ending near a punching-bag, for the vast majority of the book is damn fine fare.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I've read some of the other reviews and I have to say for myself, I LOVE the album. The songs are thoughtful and personal AS are most of her songs throughout her career span. Favorite tracks - &quot;I'm So Stupid&quot; &amp; &quot;Nothing Fails&quot;. However, if you're wanting to hear songs like &quot;express yourself&quot;, you're not gonna find it here. This album won't appeal to alot of people. Maybe with the right music videos behind certain radio friendly songs, but other than that, I don't see this album being a big success commercially. But hey, who cares. What's important is the music itself and its brilliant...Still on a personal level, my admiration of her has changed a little. I don't like the way she's handled the promotion of the album. I HATE the fact that she pulled the original &quot;american life&quot; video. Madonna is a VIDEO artist. True, MTV doesn't play her videos like they did in the past, but she's known for her innovative videos as well as the music itself. One of the reasons I love Madonna is for the fact that she wasn't afraid to speak her mind. This time around, she caved in, and it leaves this album tainted. She doesn't have to be 'shocking', but I do want her to be honest with her work. Otherwise, she's just like everyone else. The Madonna we fell in love with is a leader. I'm hoping this is just a strategic move on her part thinking that she can release this on DVD and make some money from it because that video, from the clips I saw, looks phenomenal and deserves to be shown one way or the other.

Everything about the film is perfect from the songs on screen to the performances by a cast not known for singing and dancing. I loved it and have seen it two more times if you love musicals or good films in general you will love it.
6304508611|5.0|First of all the biggest celebrity crush Ive had in my life was Sissy Spacek.She looks absolutely gorgeous if you ask me.Its sort of strange to see such a beautiful person to be picked on so viciously. Sue Snell's heart was in the right place at the wrong time. Thats whats so tragic. It looks like Tommy Ross really was falling head over heels for Carrie. Im jealous of anyone who has kissed or even just danced with Sissy Spacek.
6305388458|4.0|The Pythons make a spoof of the life of Jesus Christ and the Roman Empire. Brian, the quasi-Christ, joins one of the many anti-Roman crowds and becomes a greatly admired figure among the Jews. During these travels we get to briefly view the genitalia of the deceased Graham Chapman. We ultimately get to see Chapman and Eric Idle freeze their buttocks in the process of crucifixion. <br />This one isn't as good as Meaning Of Life. But it's a better flick than most being pumped out in the modern era.
B00004X01U|5.0|This is such a great CD. It is the first Madonna CD that I ever owned! It's better than AMERICAN LIFE, but not as good as RAY OF LIGHT. I really like teh songs MUSIC, RUNAWAY LOVER, and DON'T TELL ME. Music is a fun dancy tune. Runaway Lover is just a great song. And Don't Tell Me is awesome. I knew it would be a huge hit the second I listened to it. The rest of the CD is really good, too! It goes into more of a slow more depressing mood than the very upbeat Ray Of Light CD. Nonetheless, this CD rocks. It's so good. I recommend it to everyone. I know you'll like it. ENJOY!!!!!
B000002BFZ|4.0|if you're looking for something mellow then this is the one. I love the sound that they achieved in this record though, specially the guitars.
B000063147|5.0|There are a lot of hardcore bands out there now a days... A lot of them sound the same. Their screams sound the same, so do their guitars and drums. Avenged Sevenfold has its own unique sound that is both good and original. <br />I cant stop listening to this album, its that good. Its really lengthy too, which is good. Its really melodic in the guitar riffs and vocals too, he does growl, but also sings beautifully. <br />Highly recommended if youre into metal, punk, hardcore what have you. It borrows from many different genres. Do yourself a favor and get this, youll thank me later!
0385474547|2.0|What I think. I think his book was very boring. I really did not understand it. It had humongous words in it, that were very hard to understand. If I were to tell someone my opinion about thisi book I would say to read a different book.
B000002IOW|5.0|Although i dont own this cd, i have read and heard most of this cd its different than hold your fire. Which maybe their most radical change in style ever and a gem the return of solos is on this more of them at least i still favor hold your fire over this but this is rush and rush's worst cd is most bands best. Musicianship on this is as tight as usual the bass lines on scars are some of ged's best yet. Check it out if your a rush fan or progressive rock fan period.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Once more with feeling- was ,imho, the best episode of season 6 if not the whole season. This cd complies the music/songs of that episode- from the opening title song to the end ..grr arrgh. A nice bonus was the special tracks from past episodes- hush, restless and sacrifice.<br />the amazing thing is that all songs were written by the joss whedon, and that all the actors lent their own vocals to their songs--a brillant endeavor for an already outstanding cast! <br />there are of course musical standouts- anthony head (giles) and amber benson (tara) and of course spike are the musical highpoints. Anthony Head, is of course, already a recognized musician (see his own CD- music without elevators) and he performs exceptionally well on his solo-\\"Standing\\" as well as the mini duet he and amber benson shared (under your spell/standing)<br />The songs of \\"Once more with feeling\\" are as varied as the performers- there is a song to fit every mood,( From spike's alt rock song \\"rest in peace\\", xander and anya's broadway based \\"I'll never tell\\") I most enjoyed the musical ensembles- buffy is of course an ensemble show and the best songs were those that had every voice (walk through the fire/where do we go). But even those without singing experience participate, though briefly--(willow's line-- i think this line's mostly filler--was hilarious).<br />In the end, this was a great cd for fans already familiar with the show and this particular episode- for non fans, i would recommend picking up the DVD of season 1-4 and pray that Season 5 and 6(with the brillant muscial buffy episode )is available on amazon soon!
B000068FUS|5.0|Great album, no doubt about it.  I still listen to it, as well as the two DBT albums that followed it, on a fairly regular basis.  The lyrics and arrangements go far beyond what most bands these days are capable of imagining, and the sound is great - wide open, lot's of atmosphere, none of that over-compressed plasticity that modern producers seem to love.  Just good ole rock and roll, the way it used to be when I was a kid.  The fact that most of my old idols figure in the songs here is just icing on the cake.       On a parallel note and as extra reason for purchasing this and other DBT cds, the band takes great pride in the packaging of the product.  This is as close as you can come to those great vinyl record jackets of yore.  Not many bands on such a strict budget go the extra distance to make it such a pleasure to open a cd these days, but the DBT digipacks, artwork and booklets are fantastic.
B00004TH6O|4.0|Not much I can say here besides giving an alternate take being new to the whole QOTSA thing.  Having bought this record a couple of years back, mostly because of glowing reviews and the fact that it was like 7 bucks, I thought I couldn't go wrong.  Regardless, the album was forgotten after a couple of listens, either for being too abrasive or off-kilter for me to immediately grasp.<br />Recently, however, I've given this quite good record a second chance.  While I can't say I'm keen on the stoner-rock thing, a driving rock record is always a good thing, and this record has it in spades.  While in all of the tracks you can see some straightforward elements, they all manage to offer something new and original, and remain dark and compelling lyrically.  For what is considered \\"stoner music\\" this is also surprising dynamic.  \\"Stoner music\\" brings to mind bands like Phish who drag out the same chords for over 20 minutes, not here where the mood changes drastically from song to song.  \\"Feel Good Hit of the Summer\\" kicks off the album with a driving riff and an(ironic?) drug-influenced mantra.  Seems humor is one of their specialties, as well.  From there you go into the record's admittedly best song, \\"Lost Art of Keeping a Secret\\" with awesome lyrics and an almost 70's styling to the music.  After that comes \\"Leg of Lamb\\" which takes a trippy beat and attaches to it an almost hushed, omnious lyric on paranoia, in stark contrast to the previous song.<br />The record swings wildly between laid back (\\"Autopilot\\"), up-tempo grungy rockers (the awesome \\"In the Fade\\" with Mark Lanegan), and even epics (\\"Better Living Through Chemistry\\", \\"I Think I Lost My Headache\\"), which is amazing considering its under 45 minute length.  There's no need to be familiar with this band's history to enjoy this.  Like me, you may take a long time to appreciate the record's eccleticism and dark undertones, but if you're a fan of intense rock music in any guise you can't go wrong with this.
B00007KQA3|2.0|I'm sorry, but this movie does not do any justice to the power of the book 1984.  If you don't read it and simply dive into this film, you will be lost, bored, and will not have seen an unforgetable and frightful parallel with modern society.  Please, I beg you, read Orwell's original vision!
B00008S2VG|1.0|I'm sorry, Madonna...I've been a fan since Day 1....but this has to be the worst release you've done!

B000089RVX|5.0|Where did they come from?  I've never heard a rock band with such a strong female vocalist.  The CD has Christian undertones which I really liked.  The songs are rock solid.  I'm going to actively seek out one of their venues.  Probably my new favorite band besides U2.  BEST CD I'VE BOUGHT IN OVER 4 YEARS!!!
B000002LCD|5.0|I always liked this soundtrack. I remember seeing the cover for the first time and that's what drew me too it. I think &quot;Who's That Girl?&quot; is one of her best songs. It is uplifting and fun.
B00006879E|5.0|Having just watched them perform last night with Sugar Ray and matchbox twenty, I'd say these guys have a great future in the business.  They had an undeniable chemistry on stage, and the fact that they managed to keep up with such popular bands speaks worlds about them. The songs were catchy and well written. It seems pretty much everyone else in the arena agrees.  Their CD sold out within the hour of their playing, and the guys were even nice enough to sign the cover!  I hope to hear a lot more from them!
B00005OAIE|1.0|When he sings, it sounds like he has a large bathtowel crammed in his throat.  It doesn't even sound like singing.  Maybe he should just stick to his songwriting (which I'm not very impressed with anyway) and let someone with an actual voice perform it for him.

B00003CXAA|5.0|This is a movie precedes every other movie made in history.  The film, the language used, the backgrounds selected, the storyline written... it just moves a man.  This film is done in such a way, you will watch it over and over again, like I have done.  Very much on details throughout the whole 5 discs just a few specks here and there at times (but what do you expect for a 1970s film beautifully restored).  The audio is superb and clear.  Its just wonderful and if you are a vivid fan of the movies... its a MUST GET for your collection!
B00005JL96|5.0|I write the title \\"A Sleeper Hit\\" because that's what I believe the movie to be.  I admittedly did not want to see this movie when I saw the trailers in the theatres.  The movie just seemed too unconventional for Disney for me to consider.  But I []decided to watch it and was really glad I did.  This movie was a lot of fun and I thought that fun was missing from a lot of movies these days.  (I will spare the plot recap because every other review includes one.)  I thought that it was a fresh breath of air that I've needed since there were very few good movies that came out that summer.  I would highly recommend this movie and if not as a purchase, as least consider a rental.<br />On the level of story development, I believe it was well done.  Some have said rather harsh statements regarding the characters and story, but for some reason or another they may have not connected to the movie like I have.  I am not an orphan and do not live in a broken home, but I don't think you need this history to feel the emotion and understand the characters.  And while many have criticized the film for being a little violent, remember it was rated as PG.  That should have given you some indication of how the movie would be.  Just lay back and try to not be too critical because you could just be missing out on a great heart-felt and funny film.<br />Surprisingly, I haven't read anyone talk about the extra DVD features.  I think they are excellent.  They give so much insight to the process of making the film that even if you do not like the movie, you may appreciate it more.<br />Overall, this movie was a blast and well worth it.  I only tend to buy DVDs that I would watch over and over again and this is definitely one of them.

B00005JLD4|5.0|Based on (part of) a true story, &quot;Rabbit-Proof Fence&quot; details the long journey that three young aboriginal girls embark on after being forcefully taken from their family in order to learn how to &quot;fit into&quot; a white society.<br />The story is fascinating, and the execution from director Phillip Noyce is stunning.  This is a perfect film for history teachers to show their students.  The performances are very natural and winning.  Peter Gabriel's score is excellent - with the music playing over the closing credits being some of his best work ever (and appearing in a slightly different form as &quot;Sky Blue&quot; on his 2002 album, _UP_).<br />If you have seen this movie and enjoyed it, the DVD is a keeper.  The audio commentary from Noyce is superbly done.  In addition to giving the viewer background as to how and why he did the movie, he also offers up some interesting tidbits about the difference between working on mainstream films (&quot;Clear &amp; Present Danger,&quot; &quot;Sliver,&quot; etc.) and smaller films like &quot;Rabbit-Proof Fence&quot; and &quot;The Quiet American.&quot;  A good documentary is included as well.

B00008S2VG|5.0|I knew it would happen. America and the world has for the most part, embraced Madonna once again with her Confessions album. They look back on her catalogue and rediscover (or, in this case, discover) her previous overlooked work, such as American Life. Released during the first few weeks of America's invasion of Iraq - the album stumbled because of political events. Most people brushed off the album as Madonna trying to be a revolutionary without listening to the music. The title track and cover are disjointed with the overall theme of the album. Love is a dominant theme: Love Profusion, Nothing Fails, Intervention, X-static Process. In fact, American Life dominates Confessions in that respect - it has some bloody good ballads. Nothing Fails and Intervention provide the listener to depth and solitude. Hollywood, the forgotten single (which deserved to go top 10 - actually, it deserved to chart anywhere on Billboard) is a thumping guitar driven tune that makes Madonna sound like an angry Sheryl Crow spitting venom at the industry. I'm So Stupid showcases Madonna at her finest rock electronica movement - something that would be taken upon during her Remixed and Revisited EP. Love Profusion, a simple folk electronica song is simplistic in its melody and message - and succeeds in making the listener want to induldge in its groove. Nobody Knows Me - a fine sequel to Impressive Instant from her \\"Music.\\" album. Mother and Father - her child like pain juxtaposed with Kylie-esque moody electronica. Die Another Day - the only top 10 hit here, and features Mirwais signature start and stop thumping. Perhaps the finest moment comes at the close of the album. Easy Ride, joines strings and an electronic beat to create Madonna's finest album closer.  <br />American Life. Rediscover the brilliance of this album. Give Madonna's war a chance. <br />
0441172717|4.0|The Atreides family is assigned to Arrakis, where they exploit melange; a special spice needed specifically for interstellar travel.  Meanwhile, Paul, a member of the family is studying the ancient arts of the Benne Gesserit.  Prophecies call him the Kwizatch Haderach; the only male Benne Gesserit, who will free the people of Arrakis and bring to blossom to humankind's most ancient and unattainable dream.  Overall, I think the magnificent book Dune, stands among the major literature achievements ever to have been written.  The only thing comparable is Tolkien's work.  However, I reccomend the book only to readers with patience and a love for science-fiction and fantasy.  The book is very misleading to read and contains constant flashbacks, historical notes, and is very difficult to read comprehensively.  Good luck to all who read this book.  It is truly a work of art.
B000003CMB|5.0|\\"Live at Fillmore East\\" has got to be The Allman Brothers Band's ultimate live album. This album was recorded in early 1971 just before Duane Allman's untimely death in a motorcycle accident. The Fillmore concert preserved on this album shows the band at their very best opening with a solid set of blues numbers. Gregg Allman's gritting vocals are in top form here. Duane Allman and Dickey Betts trade guitar leads like a duck to the water. Four songs into the album, the band starts to stretch out beginning with a 19-minute version of \\"You Don't Love Me\\". Here, everybody gets a shot in the solo spotlight. It's quite a remarkable jam.<br />The instrumentals \\"Hot'lanta\\" and \\"In memory of Elizabeth Reed\\" display the solid musicianship between all of the band members.<br />With \\"Whipping Post\\", the band saved the vert best for last. The version included on this album is a 23-minute magnum-opus overflowing with musical ideas that never cease to let up until the final fade out. Duane and Dickey's guitar duals are phenomenal as is Gregg's mighty Hammond organ. The rhythm section of bassist Berry Oakley and drummers Butch Trucks and Jaimoe Johanson lock everything into a rock-solid pace. The entire album is fantastic but the main reason to own it in my opinion would be for the flawless version of \\"Whipping Post\\". Just as \\"Whipping Post\\" is fading out, the opening notes of \\"Mountain Jam\\" can be heard. This track can be heard on the Brother's follow-up album \\"Eat a Peach\\" in it's full 34-minutes. With that said, I recommend \\"Fillmore East\\" and \\"Eat A Peach\\" as a matching pair.<br />This is some great music for fans of the blues and improvised jams. This is The Allman Brothers Band at their greatest and shows just much of a great and missed guitarist Duane Allman really is.

B000001EL7|5.0|This has to be one of the top 5 best studio alblums that KISS has ever came out with.Almost every song on the alblum is a classic.The best songs from this alblum are \\"Love Gun\\",\\"I stole your love\\",\\"Shock me\\",\\"Christine sixteen\\"and\\"Plaster caster\\" but the rest of the songs are great also.I Recommend this alblum to anyone who is a fan of KISS or wants to hear a great hard rock alblum from one of americas greatest rock bands.
0060916540|4.0|This is the story of Joe Simpson's extraordinary ordeal and miraculous survival while climbing in the Peruvian Andes. While the book is not quite as extraordinary as his ordeal, it's still pretty good. <br />Simpson takes the reader along practically step-by-step as he and partner Simon Yates make a difficult climb up the mountain Siula Grande. He falls and breaks his leg high on the mountain, takes a 100-foot fall while trying to descend, then crawls and hobbles for three days to camp after Yates leaves him for dead.  He openly shares his emotions and pain as he repeatedly faces what seem to be certain-death situations.<br />It's an often gripping story. Even though it's clear that Simpson ultimately survives (how else could he write the book?), I still read eagerly on to see exactly how he would do it.  A nice addition to the tale are some small portions written from the perspective of Yates. <br />That said, I do have a few issues with the book. First, even though it's only 172 pages, it's too long.  This really should be more of a long magazine article, rather than a short book. Most of the first third of the story -- the climb up to the summit, before Simpson breaks his leg -- is probably of interest only to serious climbers. Also, while it is nice to that Simpson shares his experience in so much detail, he overdoes it. As he struggles agonizingly toward camp, his descriptions of his pain, his doubts and his fear of death get repetitive -- I found myself skimming ahead to the next key event. <br />I was disappointed in the photos in the book, which are printed on plain stock, rather than glossy, paper. As a result, many of them are dark and murky.<br />Finally, the book comes to a strange and abrupt end.  The brief postscript is too short and rather cryptic, and doesn't include any information on what ultimately happens to the other figures in the book, Simon Yates and their campmate Richard.<br />Still, if you like adventure stories, you'll find a lot to likein this book.
1587990717|5.0|To anyone who has ever traded the markets long enough to survive the occasional blow-up, Nassim's book gives one plenty to think about. I've had my own share of &quot;fat-tail&quot; events over the past eight years while I evolved from amateur trader to professional money manager, and only when one's mind gathers a need to address such issues does a book like this become more relevant. You know how the saying goes, &quot;When the student is ready, the teacher will come.&quot;<br />Practitioners with rigorous experience in the markets and who place importance in critical-thinking approaches will find value in the unconventional thought patterns presented in this book, and will make one think about the nature of one's past successes in the market and the biases inherent in one's methodologies to reach such success.<br />This is highly relevant for critical thinkers who (1) practice prudent money management rules and (2) speculate on the market.<br />For money management practioners, the concepts of bias exposure and the often-raised 'black swan' problem (i.e., no matter how many confirming data points you present, you can never really prove something is always right, but with only one contradicting piece of evidence, you can prove something is wrong) are central themes of the book, and increase one's awareness and ability to implement risk management methodologies to control for changing fundamental landscapes and the unexpected 'five-sigma' events (which occur more frequently than models suggest)--concepts alone that are worth more than the value of the book. <br />This book is also noteworthy for speculators who wish to develop an increased awareness of the nature of the 1-2% of your trades that can blow up a good chunk of one's entire equity. The mark of a mature speculator is one who learns that prevention of blow-ups can be far more valuable than an outright win. This book leads you further along that path.<br />From someone who lives and dies by the everyday decisions in the market, I highly recommend this book for your consideration.
0688163173|5.0|Shutter Island by Dennis Lehane is one of the top psychological, mystery thrillers I have ever read. I was totally caught up in the tragic story of Teddy Daniels and his deceased wife and the mission to Shutter Island. The relationship between the two U.S. marshals, Teddy and Chuck, was intricate,yet, very realistic. The Ashcliffe Mental Facility was a perfect evocation of mental health treatment in the pre-medication 1950's. Plenty of clues are sprinkled throughout the story, yet just when I thought I had it figured out, the ending threw me for a loop. Excellent, I highly recommend this novel.

B000066AXC|2.0|The film emphasizes Nash's wild childishness and insanity, which apparently were true, but conveys no sense of either the depth or breadth of Nash's mathematical creativity and contributions.  Nasar's book of the same title is far better and is far more informative, although it receives some reasonable criticism in Mirowski's 'Machine Dreams' (where the question 'What does it feel like to play a Nash equilibrium?' is posed). For an even better history of game theory, RAND, military funding of science, and simultaneously a biography of von Neumann, read Poundstone's 'Prisoner's Dilemma' (which Nasar quotes abundantly in her book 'A Beautiful Mind'). One interesting point conveyed by the film: that Nash managed his insanity by learning to ignore the voices in his head. If true, then this would be an impressive lesson for others.
B00005AFMT|5.0|Discipline may well be KC's finest recording ever. The lineup features Robert Fripp on guitar and treatments, Adrian Belew on guitar and vocals, Tony Levin on bass and Bill Bruford on drums -- a supergroup if ever there was one.<br />In its time, Discipline represented the next evolution of both prog rock and New Wave. Recognizing prog rock had evolved as far as it could, Mr. Fripp disbanded KC in '74. During the late '70s, New Wave, a literate, musically refined extension of punk, blew in like a breath of fresh air. Mr. Fripp in 1981 synthesized the two genres and took both to the next level, as he explains, &quot;by calling KC back into service&quot; and releasing Discipline.<br />His inimitable guitar work on this seminal recording was complemented nicely by Adrian Belew, no slouch on guitar who, following a stint with Talking Heads, brought a New Wave influence to KC's songcraft. Hence, the David Byrne-esque Elephant Talk, Indiscipline and Thela Hun Ginjeet.<br />Matte Kudasai is my favorite here, a mournful ballad on which Mr. Fripp plays so lyrically it breaks your heart. At one point during his solo, he evokes the sound of birds.<br />Discipline and its companion releases through '84 synthesized New Wave and prog rock, no small accomplishment given the diametrically opposed sensibilities of these genres. Leave it to Mr. Fripp to pull it off, distinguishing him not only as one of rock music's greatest guitarists but also as one of its greatest visionaries.

B00005JLEU|5.0|Typical Miyazaki film, as I watched the movie ..  I just kept getting the feeling I would be seeing action figure toys and cute little fad items in the futures.  Just like Princess Mononoke had its cute Tree Spirits.  Visuals is certainly amazing and the story line is very entertaining for all ages.  The movie goes through the entire emotional range, from some very startling moments, to teary, to humorous and to down right stupid.  The only gripe I had was having a 10 year old girl in a \\"love\\" story, which is highly unplausible.  <br />Otherwise, this one is a classic for the ages.
B000065V9N|5.0|So is one of my favourite CD's I have and has my all-time favourite love song.All the songs a just wonderfully writen and beautifully sung.Red Rain,Sledgehammer,Don't Give Up,Mercy Street,Big Time and of course In Your Eyes are the best songs on the album.So is the album that Peter Gabriel will always be remembered for.Out of all the songs that Gabriel as writen and sung,I think In Your Eyes is his best song ever and In Your Eyes is mine and my boyfriend's song mostly because both of us can relate to that song.While all of Gabriel's album are awesome,So is his absolute best.
B000002J09|5.0|I'm fifteen years old, and with the possible exception of the Who's &quot;Who's Next&quot;, Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot; and the Beatles' &quot;Revolver&quot;, this is the greatest album ever!  Period!  In my mind, &quot;Black Dog&quot; should be ranked somewhere in the top ten songs of all time, and it makes a superb opener for the album.  And if you thought that was as good as Led Zeppelin could get, the next song,&quot;Rock and Roll&quot;, screams itself into rock and roll history as quite possibly the most perfect straight out rock and roll song ever recorded.  This, and not Stairway to Heaven, is Led Zeppelin's best song. But not to diminish &quot;Stairway's&quot; status as being one of the greatest overall songs ever! This song starts out slow, not really rock and roll - but the guitar solo towards the end is rock and roll perfection.  Perfection is something Zeppelin accomplished with regulatiry, it seems.  Regardless of whether or not you like &quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot; or &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot;, almost no album can compare with this. It shouldn't matter that &quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot; is at some times boring - having &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; and &quot;Black Dog&quot; on the same album should make any music lover estatic! It is definintely not common to see the 116th greatest song of all time(Going to California), the 41st(Black Dog), the 11th(Rock and Roll), and the number one song of all time(Stairway to Heaven) on the SAME ALBUM!  Not only is this Led Zeppelin's best album, but it's rock's best album as well.  Buy this album right now!
B00003CXBH|4.0|&quot;The Mission&quot; is a heartbreaking tale of redemption, survival and tragedy told in the mountains of Argentina and Brazil.  It stars Robert DeNiro and Jeremy Irons and focuses on Britain's involvement in colonizing the tribal indians and then, destroying their homeland.  Not to be missed, this 1986 Cannes Film Festival winner is perhaps both DeNiro and Iron's finest hours on film and the moving, Oscar-winning score will make your skin crawl.  <BR>Warner Home Video has done a fantastic job on the DVD transfer. Though color and black levels are still a little weak, the picture is, for the most part, nicely balanced, with rich textured hues, excellent contrast levels and incredible detail, even in the remotest background information.  Pixelization is non-existant.  Aliasing and shimmering of fine details is extremely rare.  There was only one instance where edge enhancement was detected and this, for less than 30 sec. of screen time.  The audio is 5.1 remixed and has a nice expanse in the musical score and effects track.  Voices do tend to sound front and center rather than spread across all three channels but, then again, this is a movie from 1986, with all the inherant shortcomings of a soundtrack from that decade factored in.  Background hiss is non-existant.  <BR>Extras: An audio commentary, theatrical trailer and the absolutely brilliant documentary that revisits the actual sites used in the making-of &quot;The Mission&quot;.  <BR>BOTTOM LINE: Warner deserves the highest marks for this 2 disc set.  Long - the leaders in DVD excellence, &quot;The Mission&quot; is just another reason why more people should be writing in to the studio to specially thank them for their mastering efforts.  They are, bar none, the best in the business.
B00005JKCH|4.0|Here's my movie review:<BR>First, I'll start with a synopsis.  Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) starts off as a normal geek trying to get the girl of his dreams (Kirsten Dunst).  He then gets bit by a spider and gains some superhero powers.  He puts on a costume and turns into Spider Man, and then goes out to stop crime and face down his enemy the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), who happens to be the father of his best friend (James Franco).  Well, I didn't go into great detail but you get the point.<br />Sure, this is a souless movie blockbuster, but it grabs your attention.  Two hours may be to long to sit through a movie like this, and the movie may not change you or affect your life, but their is enough action to hold you over.  The actors all turn in suprisingly good performances, even a scence-stealing JK Simmons as a newspaper reporter.  I reccomend this movie to anyone in need of a two hour pleasure ride.<br />Now, on to the DVD extras.  Wow, two discs of extras.  There are so many extras its unbelievable.  Im not going to go into great depth for each one, but there are so many that you will have to spend days if you want to see each one.<br />Movie: 4 stars <BR>Extras: 5 stars<BR>Total: 4.5 stars
B000089RVX|5.0|....<BR>So I lied.<br />This album is a wonderful mixture of rock and gothic music, all neatly crafted together to be easy on the ears, while keep the listener intent on the background beat and Amy Lee's lyrics at the same time.  <br />One thing that someone should respect about this band is the variety in their music.  The album opens up with 'Going Under', which shows off Amy's rocker voice, accompanied by catchy guitar chords.  Yet when the track 'Tourniquet' begins to play, the keys of the piano play a sullen melody, with Amy's more Enya-esque voice singing along with it.<br />To be quite frank, I am surprised that the band had been around before the movie Daredevil and hadn't gotten some kind of recognition.  \\"Fallen,\\" has to be one of the best CDs I have ever listened to, and I predict it will stay the best for a very long time to come.
B000002GJ7|5.0|I bought this album 10 years ago and loved it. I lost it when I moved, and after a while, I had to buy it again. I mean, I wanted it again! This is a great album made by Extreme. Nuno's guitar is just amazing, Period. It's not just some hardrock out there, but Extreme has real music. You will NOT regret owning this album. One of the best album!
B0000931OG|5.0|I am just haunted by this CD.  Damon Albarn et al have taken various musical influences, notably African/Middle Eastern, and concocted a beautifully textured set of music that somehow all comes together in the end.  All of the tracks end up bouncing around in your head at some point, and you can't get them to leave, you just end up listening again.  The band's experimentation with different sounds to make up for Graham's departure, if that is what happened, has resulted in a fascinatingly diverse CD that simply mesmerizes you from beginning to end.  Stunningly beautiful and brilliant, this CD surpasses anything this accomplished band has done before.

0790743221|5.0|Getting ready for a wedding is always a challenge.  But imagine trying to organize a wedding with your ex-husband hanging about, your father dallying with another woman, and a scandal magazine sending a reporter and photographer to dog your every move.<br />That's the dilemma spoiled socialite Tracy Lord (Katharine Hepburn) faces in &quot;Philadelphia Story.&quot;  To keep her father's marital indiscretion out of the paper, Tracy agrees to let the magazine send a journalistic team to cover her high-society wedding to dull-as-dirt industrialist George Kittredge.  With Cary Grant as Tracy's ex and James Stewart as the guy-next-door reporter, poor George doesn't stand much of a chance at getting Tracy to the altar.  Further mishaps ensue as Tracy tries to pass her uncle off as her (absent) father and celebrates with too much champagne--and perhaps too much Jimmy Stewart--at a pre-wedding party.<br />&quot;Philadelphia Story&quot; crackles with witty dialogue and sparkles with outstanding performances, not just from its stars (Hepburn, Grant and Stewart, who won a best actor Oscar for his role), but also from the supporting cast.  Ruth Hussey as the not-easily-impressed career-girl photographer provides a terriflc foil to the sometimes imperious Tracy.  Dinah Lord stirs things up as Tracy's kid sister.<br />Hepburn, of course, is absolutely incredible.  In the role of Tracy Lord, Hepburn seemed to find her footing, and never lost it again.  Back when her name was branded box office poison, Hepburn snatched up the film rights to Philip Barry's Broadway hit play, teamed up with two of Hollywood's greatest leading men, and made the comeback of a lifetime in &quot;Philadelphia Story.&quot;  She followed up this classic with &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; two years later, teaming with Spencer Tracy for a 26-year on-and-off-screen relationship.<br />If you enjoy &quot;Philadelphia Story,&quot; you also might want to check out the musical version, &quot;High Society,&quot; starring Grace Kelly as Tracy and Bing Crosby as her ex, and Celeste Holme as the photographer.
0385504209|5.0|I must say that in reading some of the reviews listed here many of you have not read &quot;Angels and Demons.&quot; This book by Brown also leads the reader by the strings of the Harvard man and the questionable views of the Christian, and more importantly, the Catholic Church. Having already been introduced to Brown's skepticism I was prepared for this new maze of secrecy and exciting travel.<br />Brown uses his exceptional skills as a novelist to guide you through unknown territory. He makes you think, analyze, question, argue, relent, and hopefully reinforce your true beliefs... whatever they may be. You can reaffirm your faith, entertain immense possibilities or spend time condemning another way of thought - in any case you are completely active in the story. You are completely compelled to turn the page to figure out what lies ahead.<br />Brown touches on so many controversial topics that plague us today that he should definitely be hailed as a great conversation starter! He touches on topics that are not wholly made up nor are only from Baigent's &quot;Holy Blood, Holy Grail.&quot; These beliefs/theories/conspiracies are not necessarily common, but they do lie beneath the surface bubbling with intrigue. I have extensive studies and degrees in art as well and if the Last Supper is da Vinci misleading the Christians, it is not a far step to believe his sketches (labeled sketches) were meant to follow in the same path. Keep in mind those who assess the work of others are always ASSUMING they are correct unless there is an essay provided by the artist referencing the exact meaning of the work.<br />I am Catholic and my beliefs are as such. However, I do not find this book insulting, rather an affirmation of what I believe. My research into the topics of this book have yielded interesting FACTS which I continue to study.<br />All in all BRILLIANTLY FACINATING! Fun read - pick it up!

B00008RH3L|5.0|Many films might aspire to be worthy of the \\"Godfather\\" persona. \\"The Godfather\\" is memorable for the distinct dialogue and signature moments.  The Coen brothers have carefully crafted a period dialect that captures the cartoonish caricatures of a bygone era.  I remember this movie came out around the time of the overblown \\"Dick Tracy\\".  This film deftly pushes the humor without losing the drama, and deserves much more recognition.  After all, the Coens labored long and hard to achieve this.  This is their \\"Citizen Kane\\".    <br />And the terrific casting: Early appearances by Steve Buscemi, John Turturro, plus Albert Finney as a mob boss (far from \\"Tom Jones\\").  Others in the comic book cast have memorable one-liners.  \\"It ain't elves\\", \\"Don't forget to put one in the brain\\", \\"I'm just speculatin' on a hypothesis\\"    Watching it again, you catch more nuances in the lyrical dialogue, and are swept along with the beautiful cinematography and soundtrack.  <br />A *MUST HAVE* !!
B000001FZK|5.0|Far cry from their synth pop heyday.  This is a slow, dissonant, ambient, and tortured collection of songs.  Some songs break into loud noise, others flow steadily, and others slither in tempo and are filled with animosity and sadness.  Parts are symphonic noise symphony and those are the songs that I enjoyed the most because it allows the music to resonate.  I like this period of Talk Talk's career better because I believe it has more deeply personal meaning.  Their older synth-pop have their place, but their later stuff allows you to examine the bands quality of lyrics and musicianship better.  I didn't think the lead singer was that good until I listened to this album. Regardless, don't buy this album for a good rollicking party.
0312305060|5.0|This book is the perfect mixture of excellent use of language and an original and thought provoking idea.  It uses Virginia woolf's Mrs. Dalloway to create an intriguing post-modern novel which brought both laughter and tears to my eyes.  I was astounded at some of the language used, it struck me with its beauty.  The ideas raised in the novel were also unbelievable, giving new meaning to enjoying the beauty of life.
B00008NG5V|4.0|&quot;Brushfire Fairytales&quot; is a must buy CD, and one of my favorite CDs up to date, and &quot;On And ON&quot; also provides very good music but in a somehow different way from &quot;Brushfire Fairytales&quot;.<br />Most of the songs from &quot;On And On&quot; are short and very easy to listen to.  This is a great CD for a sunny Sunday morning music or 3-hours long drive music.  For those of you who have owned &quot;Brushfire Fairytales&quot;, don't expect this CD would be the same in terms of in-depth music creativity, but Jack Johnson's unique style is still there.  However, for those of you who have not yet heard of Jack Johnson music, you will be impressed.<br />My favorite songs include - times like these, gone, dreams be dreams, cookie jar, and rodeo clowns.
B00008OLYN|5.0|I got this album on the day of its release here in the USA (which was April 22nd I think) and not a day has passed that I haven't listened to it. I wrote a review for it after my first listening, But I don't think it was posted because I used a *gasp!* bad word, and if it was posted well then here's another review from me. Anyway, it's impossible for me to say \\"favorite album,\\" when it comes to Opeth, but Damnation is really something special, even for this band. Opeth truly is the best rock band, that is actively making music, on the planet today. In the past Opeth has weaved acoustic interludes throughout their raging extreme metal infernos, and in my opinion those mellow passages are the best part of Opeth's 15+ minute epics. That's not to say that I don't like the heavy parts too, I love them. The sonic brutality that only Opeth can deliver is staggering. But now I have a whole album devoted to mellow songs, and the masterpieces on Damnation are so eerily melodic and haunting, that just hearing them in my head sends shivers down my spine. Opeth is so much more mature than many of the bands they tour with, with the exception of Lacuna Coil and Porcupine Tree. I've seen them live twice and both times they sounded like the voice of God! Unfortunatly they didn't play any songs off of Damnation, but I'm sure they will be amazing live. This band is so far ahead of everyone else that it's staggering. They don't indulge in all the corpse painted, satanic BS so many bands conform to these days.They're all about the music, not their image/hype, and Damnation is no exception. This album reminds me of the folk-rock bands of the late 60's and 70's. Bands like Forest and Spirit, both being excellent bands. Steven Wilson from Porcupine Tree produced this album (and also performed in some pieces) along with Opeth, and they have done a phenomenal job together. Steven Wilson has become a big part of Opeth's albums in the last few years (I think he's been their producer since Blackwater Park) and their alliance works very well.  Mikael's voice is so beautiful and moving, and when you hear it over Wilson's fantastic mellotron work it's spectacular. The guitars have excellent timbre, and the melodies are brilliant. Mendez's bass work really stands out on this one. He's done an amazing job on all the other albums, but this time you can really hear his genious. Lopez's drumming is truley awe-inspiring. It's very fast and energetic, but still fits in perfectly with the mellow vibe set by the rest of the band. Everyone shows mastery over their instrument, and all turned in a truley wonderful performance. I'm not going to talk about the songs on Damnation. They're all great. All strange, eerie, beautiful, surprising Opeth phrasing. Bottom line is, this is a must have. If you're new to Opeth, or a die hard fan (like me) I'd highly recommend this album. You won't regret getting it. Get all the Opeth albums because they're all breathtaking.
B000024D4R|5.0|I haven't heard this album in over a decade and recently bought it from Amazon[.com].  It may be Floyd's most neglected masterpiece.  The length of the songs prevented their airplay but as a unified concept excellently carried out, this CD is as good as The Wall and even Dark Side of the Moon.<br />What helps make this album so unique is that this is Pink Floyd at their most stripped down.  No backing vocals or studio musicians, just Floyd.  It is also one of their most serious efforts.  It has fewer psychedelic flourishes or jokey interludes than their other albums.  The big pieces here - Dogs and Sheep - really rock and have a sharp biting edge to their lyrics.  Sheep is somewhat funny but very cynical.  <br />The \\"Animals\\" is question are personality types - Dogs being crass business men and Sheep being blind followers, for example.  True this allows Roger Waters to paint different types of people with a very broad brush, but from there he really goes for the jugular and the music backs up his dark frantic vision to the hilt.  The final minutes of Dogs may be the most brutal episode in Floyd.<br />A word about the cover.  The story I always heard was that Floyd was messing around with these inflatable animals for a promotion shoot and the pig balloon got loose and ended up floating above this grimy factory building.  They took a picture of it - and that's what is on the cover.
B000089RVX|5.0|I love this CD, it shows just how much they have grown seens there Debut in 1998-99 with &quot;Sound Asleep&quot;.  There second album was great as well,&quot;EP&quot; 1999 which includes my favorite song &quot;Solitude&quot;.  The album just before &quot;Fallen&quot; was &quot;Origin&quot; 2000 which has some incredible songs that were used (recycled) agian in &quot;Fallen&quot;, like &quot;Imaginary, My Immortal, &amp; Whisper&quot; etc...&quot;Origin&quot; is out of print though.  There is one song that I wish had gone into the final cut of the album, but did not the song is entitled &quot;Breathe No More&quot; look for it.  As for &quot;Fallen&quot; buy it!
B00005JLSE|5.0|From Catherine Zeta-Jones' kickass Velma Kelly, to Queen Latifa's mercenary Matron Morton, the motion picture version of the Broadway musical classic is practically perfect in every way.<BR>Apparently, Oscar voters agreed: awarding the razzle dazzle musical six Golden Statuettes including Best Picture! This is an amazingly entertaining, if cynical, piece, with one of Kander & Ebb's best musical scores.<br />Perfection could have been achieved had the filmmakers re-created Bob Fosse's landmark choreography. Instead, director Rob Marshall and his boyfriend reinvented the dances. The result is very good, indeed. But Fosse's work was far superior.  <br />Still and all, this is a five-star film, and great motion picture entertainment. The DVD offers the musical number \\"Class,\\" cut from the movie after preview audiences agreed that it slowed down the film. Look for the \\"Jailhouse Rock\\"-like set in the \\"Cell Block Tango\\" sequence. Marvel at Zeta-Jones' sultry, showstopper \\"All That Jazz\\". Rene Zelwegger spent many of her evenings during filming watching Marilyn Monroe movies. The Monroe influence on Zelwegger is strong throughout \\"Chicag,\\" most especially as she belts \\"Roxie\\".Even Richard Gere acquits himself musically, almost as handily as he gets his largely guilty clients acquited.<br />Start to finish, \\"Chicago\\" is nonstop movie musical magic.
0440234743|5.0|The Testament was a great book that began with the death of Troy Phelan, one of the richest men in America.  He writes a will that gives his daughter in the Amazon 11 Billion dollars before taxes.  The great twist in the book is she does not want it.  The book tells of the struggle to find her and of the battle to keep the money out of the greedy hands of his other children.  The ending of the book will suprise you and makes the 533 pages all worth while.  I would recommend this book to anyone who can read at  a high school level.
B000055WIQ|5.0|I'M AN AVID HORROR FAN AND THE EXORCIST IS, BY FAR, THE BEST ONE I'VE EVER SEEN. AT 38 I'VE SEEN ALOT AND THE NEWER MOVIES JUST DON'T GRAB ME LIKE IT HAS. EVERY HALLOWEEN I WATCH IT, I CAN'T DO IT MORE THAN ONCE A YEAR BACAUSE I GET TO CREEPED OUT.<BR>I GOT REALLY INVOLVED BECAUSE THINGS ON A SIMILAR BASIS HAPPEN MORE THAN PEOPLE WOULD CARE TO DISCUSS AND YOU CAN SEE THESE THINGS ACTUALLY HAPPENING TO YOU!  I DON'T THINK THEY WILL EVER COME UP WITH A MATCH FOR IT.
B000092Q4U|4.0|Let me first say that i own not only NAG but the BTP album. I have seen them live (the're incredible) and own a couple shirts. I listend to the cd the whole way through and even though it is excellent, it does not equal the all out brutality of NAG. The first things i noticed is that the riffs include more melody and are varied only in the sense of structure. <br />An improvement from NAG is the production. The guitars have a new feel to them, Chris's double kick sounds much much better (my biggest complaint from NAG), you still can't hear the bass, and Randall's vocals sound clearer and more intense. You still can't make out what he's saying half the time but while looking at the lyric sheet it all makes sense.<br />When i heard Steve Austin, Devin Townsesnd, and Chris Poland were appearing on ATPB i was extremely excited. When i popped the disc in, I couldn't really hear Austin or Townsend (Poland's solo on \\"purified\\" is a great addition) I was definately looking forward to another \\"Terror and Hubris\\" but I didn't get one.<br />Overall this album is great. NAG was an amazing debut and hard to follow up but LOG managed to do it. Pick this up, see em live, love REAL metal
B000069HK2|4.0|I read in someone else's review for this cd that The Used don't write their own songs... I just wanted to write my own review to say that that is completely untrue.  If you look at the top of the little booklet with the cd, you will see, &quot;all songs written by the used.&quot;  I almost didn't buy this cd because of that because i hate bands that don't write their own songs or anything(boy bands and teenage female singers).  Anyways, this cd is pretty good, with mostly good songs, although im not in to the whole excessive loud screaming; im more into emo/pseudo punk(and a little ska) myself, but this cd has a good amount of really good songs... in particular, &quot;a box full of sharp objects&quot;, &quot;Buried myself alive,&quot; and &quot;the taste of ink&quot; are awesome.  Also, i dont really know why people are calling them a punk band... i know they are, but they resemble linkin park and staind more than they do new found glory or other emo bands... whatever, this cd is not to be missed... buy this cd!
B000002KOQ|5.0|It's hard to be objective and fair when evaluating the work of someone you consider to be the greatest EVER of the particular medium in which they work, so I won't even try.  The point is, Ladies of the Canyon contains some of the past century's most enduring musical works, songs that put on dazzling display Ms. Mitchell's supernatural gifts of conveying experience through music and plain lyrical splendor.  To be sure, Ms. Mitchell is incomparable as a writer, and where others may surpass her for sheer purity of vocals (Ella, Garland and Streisand are the most obvious examples) Joni's not-too-extraordinary singing voice affords her songs a certain humility, a quality that would otherwise escape these larger-than-life but somehow still encased-within-everyman songs.  My personal favorites from this record are the darker ones: Blue Boy, Rainy Night House, Willy and For Free all tell stories that pay tribute to the human identity (and in some cases, anonymity).  There is something inexplicably poignant and profound about each of these songs-- almost achingly human is the best descriptor I can come up with.  The more popular Big Yellow Taxi, Woodstock, and The Circle Game are still as magical as ever, and there are bounties to be unearthed with every listening of The Arrangement, Priest, and Conversation.  Being in my early twenties, I will admit that I'm still figuring out the genius of Joni Mitchell, but after listening to her I find that nothing else flows quite as naturally or as pleasantly through my ears.  I now wish I had grown up with Joni instead of Mariah/Madonna/Boyz II Men and all the others whose albums have slipped to the back of my closet.  Suddenly, I feel I was born thirty years too late.
B000002H2H|5.0|Obviously being among the Gods of Metal, Metallica still rocks out to this day. This, their sophmore album marked the first time James Hetfield made a strong statement that he would work hard to work with the music, instead of angrily \\"singing\\", as he did in Kill Em' All. Great CD, \\"For whom the Bell Tolls\\", and \\"The Call of Ktulu\\", are two of my favorites. Highly recommended.
0156907399|4.0|&quot;To The Lighthouse&quot; is a portrait of the Ramsey family; a portrait &quot;taken&quot; as they are vacationing at their summer home on the rugged coast of Scotland. This is a very interior portrait, though, the most interior I've ever stumble upon in any book to date. For me, at least, this book transcends the barrier of time, culture and all else and speaks straight from the soul, something few authors have been able to do. <BR>    Two things struck me about the experience of reading it. One is that while I cant claim full understanding, I no longer found myself struggling with the form in order to read the book. The second is how much more booming the book  became for me now that I'm older and can identify more with Mrs. Ramsey instead of seeing the book only through the character of Lily Briscoe.<BR>    To the Lighthouse brings the Ramsey family and the people they bring their wake to their home on the Isle of Skye. Families in the world of this book are little things. The first half creates the Ramsey family group so well that when the second half is without it, the reader is always aware of the ghost images standing in the empty spaces. We found out what has happened to the missing members of the group by a reunion with the ghosts of the past. Meanwhile, lily tries to understand the world shes in and make her painting by meditating about the ramseys and how much has changed in the world around them.<BR>       I beleive that Woolfs well known stream technique at its more poetic and influential than anyone else I have read. The boook is very beautiful and sad at the same time. I'll look forward re-reading it again in a couple more years. It's luminous, it's astonsishing, it's prizewinning. It's a book I think high school students should be made to read to really understand life at its fullest.
B000069AUI|4.0|This album rocks!  Parachutes only had about two good songs.  Rush of Blood keeps dishing out one good track after another.
B00005YW4H|1.0|I bought this album. Only two songs that are good the rest all sound the same with very little to nothing to offer. I am trying to find someone I know who truly thinks that his was a good album. Unfortunately, I have been looking for quite some time. Still do not know what to do with it.
B00006F83Y|5.0|I have not yet gotten tired of listening to this!  Too much new music today is rehashed junk.  How refreshing it is to listen to something original.  Some of the between song commentary reminds me of Roger Waters Radio KAOS.
B000069AUI|5.0|Best band to appear on the music scene in twenty years. Their sense of melody and chord structure is fresh and original. They have renewed my faith in the pop rock format.
0385504209|5.0|I had never read a novel which I could not put down until I read THE DA VINCI CODE (TDVC).  I've heard and read that phrase used so many times before but have never actually experienced such a phenomenon.  The plot of TDVC is so enthralling that you DO NOT WANT TO PUT IT DOWN until you read the whole book.  Mr. Brown has come up with such an amazing story/theory (perhaps?) that it compels you to not only enjoy the book but also to ponder the hisorical points he mentions.  Don't know which are true and which are not but it leaves one very curious.  Would love to see a sequel.  Perhaps one dealing with family members of the present Merovingians (Was surprised to see this name used as one of the characters in THE MATRIX: RELOADED as the movie was filmed before the book came out . . . curious.)
B00008OLYN|4.0|No, it is not the typical Opeth album, but none the less, it is a masterpiece of great musicianship. These songs are all slow and have dark depressing lyrics, but they bring you through a journey that no one could imagine Opeth would be doing. All the songs are very well written and composed, none of them get old. Every time I listen to this album I like it more and more. If you are looking for heavy guitar riffs, machine gun drumming and growling vocals, don't buy this album. But if you are looking for a softer, yet still musically complex effort, this is about as good as slower music gets!
B000002H97|2.0|Ok, One was a great video, but they should have stopped there. This album is the true turning point of Metallica. Although this album contains many good songs, it shifted to a drastic commercial appeal. There is no need for an album to have 1/2 of the songs end up as singles and vidoes, that is just a cry for coperate attention, and the trade-mark of 3 year bands who are popular after their first album, then realize they [are bad]. Many people love this album and I have no idea why, it is not Metallica's finest work by far.
0316666343|2.0|After being hyped up for months, I decided to choose this book for an independent reading project and now I have decided never to listen to another critic again. Hearing so many great reviews from critics and fellow readers, I figured that it must be an amazing book. But now I wish that she hadn't wasted this brilliant idea on the book that she wrote for it. <BR>     The book begins with our main character, Susie, narrating from heaven telling us the story of the life on earth after her death. You are intrigued by her murder and rape when you first start reading the book yet, that is the one and only exciting part of the whole story. We start to hear about her heaven which then quickly becomes an unhappy place. She describes heaven as an atmosphere where you get anything you want, whenever you want but never seem to be happy with it. This is annoying to read about. Who wants to hear that heaven is an unhappy place! Susie can't seem to just be happy with how she is now. She dwells upon her old life which she will never be able to be a part of. Just get over it. <BR>     We then see people like her sister who is so unbelievably unbelievable. At her young age, right after her sister's death, she acts as if she were 25 years old coping with a break-up. She denies everything, as does the rest of her family. She seems to be the backbone to everything in the family and yet she is only around 11 or 12. She then meets her future husband at the age of 11. This is just so unreal and is a fantasy that never happens. And not once do they ever fight in the book. Very unreal. <BR>     Her parents are a whole other story. Jack, the father, is the only person book who seems to grieve after the death. He is the only on character who shows emotion and the only character we can feel for or relate to. The mother on the other hand is probably one of the most ridiculous characters I've ever even read about. She doesn't even seem to care about her daughter death and then have an affair with the detective working on the case. She leaves her family one day with no explanation to her family or even the reader. <BR>     The other 100 characters just have no relevance in the story. The confused/lesbian/sixth sense girl just makes no sense what's so ever. I can't begin to figure her out. She just seems to be there to see dead people and cause conflict. Then we have Ray who has no personality and is only included to be a romantic interest for Susie to obsess over. Susie's grandmother, Lynn, is a poor excuse as the comic relief. She is an alcoholic with what seems to be no life and has a large crush on a 20 something year old guy. She 70 for god sake.<BR>     For a while a tried not to let myself think it was as bad as it truly was. I really wanted to like the book so I actually got to the end. The one thing that I must do is give Sebold some credit. She stirred up an amazing plot. That is basically was captivated my interest. With such a creative base I figured that the story must be pretty interesting, but I couldn't bring myself low enough to enjoy it. Even though the basic design was interesting, all in all, I really disliked it and found it very untrue. I felt that I was being misled through the journey of the book. I thought that it was realistic until characters started seeing dead people and exiting their bodies and such. The writing is uninspiring and very child-like. It is very straight forward and there is no room for interpretation. I feel like Sebold wanted to make an adult book but forgot to make an adult story line and use sophisticated words.
0060090367|4.0|Well, it's not great literature, but then no one promised it would be. And it's predictable and dredges up a host of Irish cliches for characters - but they're all charming or unrepentent or hilarious. And it's a bit too long, being essentially fluff.<BR>However, it's a fun read, it goes quickly, and you do - trust me - end up caring about the characters.<BR>Claire gives birth to her first daughter and is deserted by her husband in the space of a few hours. She hightails it back to her dysfunctional and wacky family in Dublin - dysfunctional as only an Irish family can be. There she retreats to the triple cure of vodka, exercise, and a younger man - and of course the wayward hubby comes crawling back with his, um, tail between his legs...<BR>It's a hoot and a half.

B00008VGL6|4.0|Well, the man with the golden voice has done it again.  I have read reviews comparing Counterfeit 2 to Counterfeit 1 which, in my opinion, is unfair.  Martins musical tastes have undoubtedly matured, or should I say, changed a bit.  Let me also add, that I STILL listen to Counterfeit 1 on a regular basis. Counterfeit 2 has quite an ecclectic brood of songs that let us peek into the musical likes of the man himself.  In fact, a few songs (In My Time of Dying, I Cast a Lonesome Shadow, In My Otherworld, Candy Says) sound like Martin could've written them himself.<br />Martin mixes it up by throwing in a song like Lost in the Stars which, to me, sounds like a Broadway tune (can ya see it?  Martin on Broadway?) and Das Lied... that has such an eerie sound, great hook, and makes me wish that my small town in Northern California offered German 101 at the local college, because if Martin picked it, it's got to have profound lyrics.<br />One of my favorite songs on this CD is In My Otherworld.  For those of us 30-somethings that grew up in the 80's, we can recall the mood The Smiths conjured.  This song with the sad and lingering guitar sound reminded me of those days, \\"black and blue\\", \\"mud and blood\\", the overall feel of heavy-weighted dread that we LOVED to wallow in back then.  I guess I admit I still love it.  Nothing moves me more than drama in music and this song definately has it.<br />Loverman is another success at drama.  Martin can contort his voice in many ways that this album has made evident.  When I listen to that song (over and over and over and...) I see the video:  Black and white, domination, erotica, wet hair, need I say more?<br />The straightforward vocals in Oh My Love remind me of the old days, ie Somebody, which calls to mind the man behind the delicious voice and I realize he is, indeed, the same man from that era.<br />Another reminder is the brilliant arrangement that Martin is so gifted with.  And the sounds that are produced from the synth and guitar are synergistic.  How does he do it?  Brilliant I say!<br />The more I listen to this album, the more I get attached.  I'm willing to bet that in 2 more weeks, I'll ammend my vote to 5 stars.  This is beautiful music and Martin has impeccable taste in music.  Counterfeit 1 and 2 are proof of that.  One thing is for sure, I would give both my ovaries to be able to get into his CD collection.are synergistic.  How does he do it?

0375422307|4.0|This book was so enveloping that I ended up reading it in one sitting and often returned to it later to look over all of the great images. Satrapi's black and white drawings evoke wood block printing and draw the reader into the initmate world of her family and neighbors as they cope with the drastic changes in their society and its effect on their social lives and education. The author is honest and up-front about her privileged upbringing, which in no way detracts from her legitimacy to tell the story of life under under the theocratic regime. ...

B0000214F1|3.0|This film doesnt have much of a storyline, almost no historical accuracy, and pretty cheesy set designs. There are disturbing themes of incest and sex, and downright nauseating violence. But despite the odditty of this film it can be really intersting to watch. It is more a curiosity than anything else. It can be almot painful to sit through but the unusual style of filmaking is worth watching.
B00008H2LB|3.0|I won't give this album more than three stars.  Possible three and a half.<br />Standouts that I really like:<br />-Breaking the Habit.  My favorite song on this album.  It's so unlike any other song I've heard from LP.  They should make more songs this way.  This one completely caught me off-guard... possibly the reason why I gave it three stars to begin with.<br />-Nobody's Listening.  The strings color this song differently, which I think was sort of brilliant.  A message to LP: diversity rocks.  Use it more often.<br />-Figure.09.  A bit metal-ish.<br />-Session.  I liked this one better than Cure for the Itch.<br />-Intro.  Am I listening to the same one everyone else is?  Probably not... then I don't know what song it is I must have dl'ed.  This song is awesome!<br />Those were my highlights.  The rest were just... bland.  Oh, and I just can't digest &quot;Easier to Run&quot;.  Maybe its similarities to Pushing Me Away... I don't know.<br />Yes there's a big hype surrounding LP.  I don't think they're that bad.  I used to think they were worse, then I heard the song &quot;In the End&quot;.  I'm not incredibly impressed with their music.  If the music isn't lacking, it's the lyrics.  Like I said, the one song that doesn't fail to impress me is &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot;.  Acquire this song by whatever means necessary, if you know what I mean.  If you don't want to purchase this album, at least acquire this song.
B000021Y77|5.0|I watched \\"Run Lola Run\\" for the first time in a film class my Senior year in college. I was completely surprised and impressed by this film. I had heard about it when it was first released, but I never knew what all the excitement was about. Well, I soon discovered it!<br />This film follows a young woman and her boyfriend as they try to come up with a large sum of money in 20 minutes that is owed to a gangster. What is really cool about this film is that it goes through numerous paths that each person could have taken. Once one storyline is finished, the story starts all over again in a different way. It's very exciting and that excitement is complimented by a pounding techno beat.<br />I would highly suggest this film to everyone and not just those who study film or are into indie films. I think anyone can enjoy this film because it's filled with so many things that make movies great: love, sex, suspense, pain, and triumph! You won't be disappointed!!!
B0000042MY|5.0|This is one of my favorite movie theme CD's that I play over & over until my wife tells me to turn it off...& I am one of those people that never (well, hardly ever) plays the same thing over & over again, because my co-workers play their radio rap songs over & over...you get the drill. Trevor Jones wrote the first 9 songs & this is my favorite section. He really knew how to express the crash of cultures within the time period from the French Indian war. The fast pace main theme with its sad undertow of things to come, & the ultimate Irish Jig of \\"The Kiss\\"...what master pieces with layers of cross current melodies. Randy Edelman wrote the next 6 songs, they are good, but lack the essence of the Ideal of the movie (Okay, that was too philosophical...) lacking the passion of uniting the main ideas of the movie? That looks right :) What is strange about this CD is that most people think of Clannad's \\"I Will Find You\\" as the main song of the movie, when in fact you get a very short version of that song at the very end. Almost too short because it doesn't give you time to hum along. The full length version is on Clannad's CD \\"Banba\\" at twice the time. Over all a great buy with hours of listening pleasure.
B00004U8H4|3.0|I read \\"American Psycho\\" before I saw the movie and I'm very glad I did. My reading the book prepared me for the disturbing images I would ultimately see on the screen. Christian Bale did an excellent job of portraying the monstrous yet calm Patrick Bateman in a story that takes place in the 1980s.<br />The story mainly revolves around a man in his twenties who is very successful on Wall Street in New York City. He seems very charming and normal to just about all who meet him - he even has a fiance played very well by Reese Witherspoon. However, what these people don't know is that under that charming exterior lies a vicious killer who must satisfy his need to kill whenever the mood strikes. Even though he does possess the traits of a killer, there are also some lighter scenes in the movie. The scene where Patrick and his co-workers discuss their business cards will bring a smile to your face. It's amazing how the type of paper or ink used on a card can be so important and almost seem life-threatening to these men. Their entire level of status rested upon a small card.<br />You will probably find yourself in shock throughout most of the film, but sometimes that can be a good thing. This is not a regular film that one goes to see for enjoyment. This film was made to make you feel uncomfortable and make you take a serious look at the sort of things that go on in the world everyday. The ending will have you second-guessing yourself and make you think, \\"How did that happen?\\" This movie is not for the faint of heart, but if you think you are up to challenge of watching this film, I'd recommend it!
B00000K19E|4.0|I first saw THE MATRIX during opening weekend in 1999 and was completely knocked off my feet. Normally I am not a fan of science fiction or action but this film caught my attention with its underlying existential plot. It goes far beyond gunfights and the latest Hollywood special affects. There is really something to grasp and hold on to in THE MATRIX far after the movie has ended. In preparation for the release of the sequel today I purchased this DVD to refresh my memory. I can honestly say that subsequent viewings are almost as good as the initial one. But beware, friends and family will beg to borrow this DVD!! THE MATRIX is a decent addition to one's DVD collection.
0553583182|1.0|This is the worst kind of self-help book out there- no one endorsed it, it was written in 1963(!) and by a nobody. For an example of the *insights* that awaits you, how's this; father willing to give right arm for young daughter to heal from rheumatoid arthritis *and* psoriaris - father has car accident, father's right arm is torn right off, daughter miraculously healed - the power of the subconscious mind!<BR>How about distant relative of author visits 'celebrated crystal gazer' in India, she predicts he's to die by next moon- man cannot shake this off (in spite of author's efforts) and dies from a heart attack on said day. Wow.... Look, there are no notes nor sources nor references whatsoever, not even a bio on this Murphy chap... there are 270 pages and over 250 chapters! That's right, mini-rants for mini attention-spans.....
B000000WJZ|5.0|I don't really know where to begin except by saying that Siamese Dream is truly a masterpiece. I know that Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness was more popular than this album, and was also considered their pinnacle in terms of musicianship. I would have to agree with that, but I still think Siamese Dream is the better album simply because it is not a double disc and it best represents the true essence of the Pumpkins. This album is terrific from beginning to end. Billy's voice is so soothing, even when he's screaming, you can't help but feel for him. The songcraft on this album is absolutely amazing. It ranges from hard rock/heavy metal songs such as \\"Cherub Rock\\" and \\"Quiet,\\" to lenghty, progressive rock-type songs (\\"Hummer\\" and \\"Silverf**k\\" being the two best examples) to just plain beautiful (\\"Disarm,\\" \\"Mayonaise,\\" \\"Spaceboy,\\" and \\"Luna\\").  <br />If you are looking to get into the Smashing Pumpkins, I would highly recommend getting this album first. \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\\" may have defined the Pumpkins' musical ambitions more than any other release, but this one defines their overall sound better than any of their other albums. The guitar sound used here is one of swirling, distorted, multilayered beauty; think of a combination of the sounds of \\"Are You Experienced?\\" and \\"Loveless\\" rolled into one. In fact, this is the only Pumpkins album on which this particular guitar sound is used, making it a unique effort while at the same time defining the band's true spirit.<br />This album contains many of Billy Corgan's best ever songs. Many different influences are rolled into one, whether it be the post-Black Sabbath crunch of \\"Geek U.S.A.,\\" the swollen string arrangments of \\"Disarm\\" and \\"Spaceboy\\" (predating \\"Tonight, Tonight\\" by a couple of years) or the blissed-out, My Bloody Valentine-like etheral quality of \\"Mayonaise.\\" \\"Today\\" recalls the Cure in the slow sections, while switching to a post-Kevin Shields/My Bloody Valentine direction during the chorus, and alternates between the two for most of the song. While this band's influences are many (Jimi Hendrix, the Cure, Queen, Black Sabbath, and My Bloody Valentine), they successfully roll these seeming disparate sounds together to create a unique, new, and totally orignal sound which is quite unlike anything else that came out at the time (even with the grunge connections). In short, this rollercoaster of an album is definitely  a cornerstone in alternative rock, so much so, that people have a hard time categorizing it. Don't bother. Just let the music speak for itself.     <br />To a newbie, I cannot recommend this album enough. It was one of my perennial favorites in high school, and even when I hear it now, I am still amazed by this impressive body of work. \\"Siamese Dream\\" is probably the Pumpkins' best album (only slightly beating out \\"Mellon Collie\\") and easily ranks up there with R.E.M.'s \\"Reckoning\\" and Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" as being one of the greatest alternative rock albums ever. Even if you're only casually interested in the Pumpkins, or even if you're not a fan, get this album anyway, and I guarantee it will become relevant to your life in time.
B00005AAFS|5.0|Mutter came four years after Sehnsucht, and listening to the result, i must say that they weren't losing time. Their first two albums were good, but Mutter goes much further. This is a beautiful album, from the first lines of \\"Mein Herz brennt\\" to the last seconds of \\"Nebel\\".<br />1-Mein Herz brennt- starts slowly, but not for much time. This is one of the best music pieces i will ever heard. A powerful song, with a singer that does his work perfectly, with german vocals, and with violins... incredible.10/10<BR>2-Link 2 3 4- A (great) song that explains clearly that they arn't nazis. 9/10<BR>3-Sonne- Combines perfectly heavy music with an awesome, slower chorus. Probably my personal on the album.10/10<BR>4-Ich will- I specially like the keyboard parts here. Great chorus, too. The video for this song is fantastic.8.5/10<BR>5-Feuer Frei!-Yes, the song on xXx. But my least favourite of the album. Again, i like the keyboard here, and, why not, the \\"Bang!-Bang\\"s are great, too.8/10<BR>6-Mutter- This is one of the sadest songs ever done. It's so beautiful. One of the best experiences of my life. 10/10<BR>7-Spieluhr- A song about a girl who has been buried alive. The song gets better at the end, when the piano appears and the song is really sad. 9/10<BR>8-Zwitter- Strange lyrics. Really strange lyrics. 8/10<BR>9-Rein Raus- A song about sex. Not their best, but really funny. \\"I have the key/ You have the lock/ the door opens/ I enter/ life can be so splendorous\\"...8/10<br />10-Adios- Excellent song. Great drumming. 10/10<BR>11-Nebel- Slower, and a perfect closer. 9.5/10
B00004WG2F|4.0|Rarely does a movie improve upon the original book - but this one does. The acting, the cinematography, and the additions made that were not in the book along with what the movie cut out of the book - all improve upon Jim Harrison's novellete. Regarding the book: in my opinion, so long as Americans make legends out of the types that are portrayed in Legends of the Fall, there will be senseless violence and the like. The book'<BR>s rendation of the movie's 'hero' played by Pitt, is a drunkard, wife-abandoning, expert at murder - who scalps German soldiers (will Hollywood ever tire of having fun in re-killing them?), breaks the necks and more of other booze-runners (like himself), holds no respect for the law, curses God and the like. The theme is very school-boy level at best. Indians are all bady stereotyped as mystical warrior-types. Violence is not only condoned - but praised. Though I am myself an army  veteran, I found the movie immature and disgusting in theme and content - that such characters would be portrayed as \\"American legends'.
B00005JLH3|4.0|After reading mostly positive reviews of this film, I decided to check it out, and I have to say I really enjoyed it. While the plot is a bit predictable, it great to have a movie about a subject that has never really been tackled before. A college drumline. The drumline sequences are alot of fun to watch, and Nick Cannon is wonderful, in a star making performance. Hes charismatic, intense, and believable as a college student who tries to be #1 on the drumline. Zoe Saldana from Center Stage and Crossroads gives a charming, likebale performance as Nicks girlfriend. The movie is fast paced, intense, romantic, and alot of fun to watch. Highly recommended.
B000002P5R|5.0|Jimi Hendrix obviously recorded a boatload of great songs over the months before his untimely demise.  We know that there were some songs that he planned for a double album release that never got completed (eg Valleys of Neptune, Cherokee, etc), but there were certainly enough in the can to fill up a CD.  Like each of his immortal (released) trio of studio albums, the tracks of this collection bear a familial similarity that differentiate them from his other periods.  Call it maturity, transition, or just taking things from another angle, but there is no denying these are grade a, prime cuts from the greatest musical genius of the rock age.<br />Rated his 4th best, if only because he was not around for the final touches.  But like the nice folks at Amazon point out, this is an essential recording.  It needs to be in the regular rotation on your CD player.
B000068PQ7|4.0|By 1971 Gene Clark's songwriting ability was phenomenal. This album should provide ample proof of his mastery of lyrics and melody. Having written in a number of styles and situations, including his ground-breaking work with the Byrds and his bluegrass-influenced collaboration with Doug Dillard in Dillard & Clark, Gene settles on a more low-key and reflective approach. The songs have a lean sound that's rooted in the folk sounds of the era and focused on Gene's acoustic guitar and harmonica. The style is vaguely similar to Crosby, Stills, and Nash, as well as the early 70s Byrds, who by that time had turned to a mix of folk, country, and rock. On the other hand, Gene Clark's vocal delivery, emotionally evocative and alternately melancholy and sweet, is unlike anything else.<br />While this album represents a high point in Gene Clark's writing and vocal abilities (maybe THE high point), several factors undermine the album's stellar potential. The instrumental arrangements are pretty sparse, which should work well for the material Gene wrote. Unfortunately, the actual instrumental performances are mostly mediocre, and sometimes distracting (the bass and electric guitar fills in The Virgin, for example). Most of the arrangements drone on in a very repetitive manner, with little sensitivity to what the song is trying to convey. Some of the other production choices are questionable, such as the lengthy harmonica solos and a couple of inconsistent vocal takes. The engineering is also mediocre. Some mixes actually sound thick, despite the scaled-back instrumentation. Compare White Light to the fine production on Ballad of Easy Rider, a 1969 album by the Byrds.<br />The bonus tracks are interesting, but the best material is from the original album. Some of the bonus tracks sound like the same song. They certainly could have been improved with more imaginative and less monotonous arrangements.<br />Despite these flaws, the soul of the music is still evident. Even with reservations, it's hard not to thrill at the strength of songs like For a Spanish Guitar and With Tomorrow. Many of Jesse Ed Davis' acoustic guitar lines are awe-inspiring. The mood of the album is strong and consistent. Overall, the album provides an opportunity to enjoy some of Gene Clark's finest material, while wondering about how different it could have been with the resources that were available to his peers in Crosby, Stills, and Nash and the Byrds.ations, it's hard not to thrill at the strength of songs like For a Spanish Guitar and With Tomorrow.

B0000931OK|5.0|Blur. Not only one the greatest pop groups of the nineties, but perhaps ever. \\"Modern Life is Rubbish\\", \\"Parklife\\", and \\"Great Escape\\" were all milestone pop albums, with Albarn narrating stories of British life and Coxon providing precise, chiming guitar work. But something happened to Blur. Their self-titled was an adventurous foray into a more sonic-focused direction. They started to emphasize more on soundscapes, and \\"13\\" proved this even more. But \\"Think Tank\\" is Blur's new direction fully realized. And it feels good. Real good. <br />Coxon's guitar work will be sorely missed, but Blur's new bass-and-drum focus is equally exciting. \\"Ambulance\\" kicks things off with a locked-in groove, echoing the No-Wave funk groups of the early eighties like Liquid Liquid and ESG.  The group's continuing focus on soundscapes is present, as their epic final track, \\"Battery in Your Leg\\", uses atmospheric My Bloody Valentine-esque guitar work, while \\"Brothers and Sisters\\" recalls the electronic ambience of David Bowie's \\"Low\\". Tracks like \\"Crazy Beat\\" and \\"We Got a File on You\\" prove that Blur have not completely abandoned their pop sensibilites, as they sound similar to something you would hear on their self-titled and \\"Parklife\\", respectively. \\"Gene by Gene\\" combines old Blur with new, using unique, alien sounds to give new life to Blur's perfected pop formula. With this new focus on more groove based, soundscape music, it's suprising that the best tracks on \\"Think Tank\\" are the personal, melodic ones. \\"Good Song\\" is a simple in its instrumentation and premise yet is one of the most lasting tracks on the album. \\"On the Way to the Club\\" is equally simple yet perhaps is the standout track, with Peter Gabriel-esque harmonies and warm synthesizers swelling to the point of blissful, gorgeous noise. \\"Sweet Song\\" is heavenly in tone, with Albarn's voice and elegiac piano work providing it's beautiful backbone. \\"Caravan\\" is a lo-fi masterpiece, with Albarn's distorted voice exposing him at his most personal on the album. Blur's Clash influence pops up with \\"Morrocan Peoples Revolutionary Bowls Club\\", a fun track that recalls \\"London Calling\\". Free jazz even enters \\"Think Tank\\", with \\"Jets\\" coupling lo-fi production with free saxophone improvisation.<br />\\"Think Tank\\" is perhaps Blur's most mature work. Albarn's work on \\"Mali Music\\" did Blur some good, as the world influences really give \\"Think Tank\\" color and character. But with a greater focus on bass and drums and soundscapes, Blur are traveling down a new and foreign road that will, and already has, ravaged fans and critics universal acceptance of this ever-changing group. The immediacy of Blur's previous pop masterpieces is definitely gone, but the mature, varied sound of \\"Think Tank\\" proves to the world that something more than Beatles-esque pop craftmanship is cooking in this group's head.
B000003N7G|5.0|I cannot believe that some one actually believes, much less has the bravado to voice aloud, that Kenny G. plays better Jazz than John Coltrane. Kenny G. doesn't play Jazz... he plays pop music without any lyrics, which come to think of it, is really the definition of Pop music. Man... take your head out of the sand. Kenny G. doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as John Coltrane. The fact that you don't get A Love Supreme tells me that you don't get Jazz. I guess you think that Blues Traveler plays better blues than John Lee Hooker.

B00008DDXC|2.0|OK - I love the books. I felt the first movie was OK, but not great. But this one is not good at all. The director (Columbus) was terrible; he truly let down the audience. I know people liked the films, but if you want to watch a good \\"movie\\" - seek elsewhere. I'm really hoping the new director working on Book 3 does a better job. I am trying to cleanse my mind of these awful parodies of what were brilliant novels, so that when I re-read them I will not be encumbered with the memories of terrible scenes and bad acting. Hagrid was fine, Dumbledore (Harris) you can tell is obviously not well (and soon died), Potter is so disappointing and stiff, Ron Weasley does nothing but make silly faces throughout. Oh, and there was a plot somewhere in all that mess. Very sad. I blame it all on the director. I was stunned at what a bad job was made of a great book. The whole purpose of the books was to highlight the deep relationships between the characters, but that aspect is totally skipped in favor of menial special effects and pure nonsense (why do we need to see and hear slugs being vomited out of Weasley's mouth - funny in the book when you can use your imagination, but disgusting when detailed so graphically in the film). The director has no \\"soul\\", and I rank this along with his many other bad movies. What a terrible decision putting him in charge. Here's to Book 5 out soon - and I'm done with the films.
B00008K7AN|5.0|This Was Such A Funny Movie. Rob Schnieder Rules. The Transformation Aint Realistic But The Movies Pure Hilarious. Everyone Should Watch It.
B000002G8H|5.0|Yeah, we've all heard the &quot;hit&quot; songs off this album about 10,000 times, which in the case of &quot;Wonderful Tonight&quot; is about 9,997 times too many. <br />But there's so much good music on this album that the radio-listening public didn't get to hear that you should still have a copy of &quot;Slowhand&quot; on hand. It's all good. <br />The best song on here, in my opinion, is a toss up between the rollin' and rockin' blues &quot;Mean Old Frisco&quot; and John Martyn's hopeful, amusing &quot;May You Never.&quot; Marcy Levy's vocals throughout the album are a treat, too. <br />And EC contributes some of the most tasteful (if not particularly inventive) guitar playing of his career. <br />One more thing: If you have the vinyl version of this album, next time you have a party, take the cover out, open up the gatefold and then hold your head above Clapton's guitar-playing body on the cover. I guarantee you drunk people will laugh.
0784011710|1.0|What I saw of the movie was fine, but the DVD would not play beyond the 25th chapter of the movie in any player I tried. Anyone else have that problem?
B0000844MR|1.0|As my first &quot;Superbit&quot; title, this is a disappointment.  As the description states, the film is scratched (not an issue with the transfer, but still diminishes the film).  The high-rate of encoding did not improve the video - in fact I found it dark and murky.<br />The biggest disappointment is with the audio, which has inconsistant volume in standard stereo - bass and score drown out voices in loud scenes, which are also muted compared to quiet scenes.  This requires periodic master volume adjustments.<br />In all, not worth the cost.  I admit I've not seen the &quot;Special Edition&quot; DVD.  If it's worse than this, buy it on VHS.
6305949980|5.0|The movie in itself is wonderful, but we can not forget the excellent special features.  From the creation of the movie to Tim Burtons shorts: Frankenweenie and Vincent, this DVD is a must have for stop animation lovers (or just anyone who enjoyed the movie)!
B00008MNYS|5.0|I've listened to his hits on BBC radio over the internet and decided to give his album a try.  I am happy I did.  The songs are very well produced and grew on me within two listens.  He's here touring the US and is slowly showing up on Late Night and in small venues.  He played a private concert for our radio station in Sacramento.  But I've only heard Feel on the radio a few times.  His songs range from ballad to rock and I think America will like him if he can just get on the air some more.  I'm going to get his other album now too.
B000092Q4U|5.0|I don't know why so many people are trashing every band that comes out with a new album that sounds better than the last one.  I agree with everyone who has reviewed this CD so far.  The production is so much better on this one.  The double bass drums don't sound like blocks of wood, the cymbals don't slice through your brain, and the guitars are much thicker.  I have to say that 11th Hour is the best song.  They've also gotten alittle more melodic which I think can only help the band as far as bringing it more to the masses.  Over all, this album far eclipses NAG, and I can't wait for the 3rd Lamb of God album.
B00005JLPK|5.0|This movie was absolutely breathtaking. It is very worthwile seeing Salma Hayek potray such a heartfelt story. I felt all of her emotions so deeply. Frida's highs and lows were so vivid with Salma's performance. It made me relive my passion for Art.I fully recommend it. It is very apparent why this movie was Oscar nominated.<br />Enjoy!!

0393327345|4.0|After having watched the interesting movie, I wanted to read the novel and compare the similarities and differences between the two different mediums. I find the movie to be superior, but the book is interesting nonetheless.<br /><br />FIGHT CLUB is the type of novel that won't make sense if you're just looking for a good story. To begin with, it's a novel that deals with all kinds of complex issues (the enslavement of materialism, what is reality, etc.). However, besides that is the fact that the story is told in first person, but the narrator has some serious problems and his storytelling style seems more in place in a Faulkner novel than in a modern day pop cultural literary novelty. Still the story is semi-coherent and there are some great scenes and quotes (&#34;His name was Robert Paulsen&#34;) that you will find yourself saying over and over.<br /><br />However, the novel does have one serious flaw. The writing is just plain horrible. Contrary to what Palahniuk says, he does not write the way that normal people talk. It doesn't even seem he writes in the way that normal people think. Instead, his prose is a run-off of post-modernistic deconstructionism that distracts rather than attracts.<br /><br />Still, if you can stay with it and understand all the meaning behind the words, FIGHT CLUB is worth reading.
B00006690H|3.0|I was really expecting the radio type version of clean when I bought this CD for my daughter, but just because the words are bleeped out doesn't mean you can't tell what they are.  I like EMINEM and have the \\"non-clean\\" version, but I talked with my daughter about her clean version of the album and she says she knows exactly what he is saying because \\"no other words would rhyme\\".  The scary part is that she cannot clearly comprehend why EMINEM says what he says and kids in their early teens have a hard time realizing that EMINEM is just blowing off steam; they take this stuff to heart sometimes.  We ended up just burning off only the songs we approved for her to listen to.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I wanted to see this movie when it was released last winter but it disappeared too quickly.  As I recall, it received horrible reviews and was accused of being a Matrix clone.  This movie neither deserved the bashing it took nor the insult of comparison to the Matrix.  The acting and action sequences in this movie far surpasses the Matrix.  <br />The movie rests on Christian Bale's capable shoulders and he is fantastic.  He is like Jane Austin's Mr. Darcy ripped from Emma and inserted into an Orwellian/Huxley sci-fi riff of a story.  I felt real sympathy for his character Preston which I never felt for Keanu's Neo.  His character undergoes a real journey from drugged out sadist to an emotionally mature man.  It was fascinating to watch him discover his own sexuality with Emily Watson's Mary.  It is also wonderful to watch him fall in love with his own children and also realizes that he had been terrorizing them.<br />All the other actors, Sean Bean, Emily Watson, Taye Diggs and Angus MacFadyen are first rate.  As far as Diggs' rather happy character, I say pay attention to where he is in the last scene.  It more than explains his outbursts.<br />All the Action choreography is mind blowing.  It can more than justify it's own originality.  I've never scene another movie apply the Art of the Sword to gun fighting.  Not even the Matrix did that.  Plus the fighting looks and feels real.  It doesn't try to hide the sweat or the strain.  The main baddie character makes a point of discussing how the Gun-Kata takes years of study to perfect.  Unlike the Matrix which indicates that years of study and exercise can just be downloaded to your brain and Bob's your uncle.<br />This movie deserves a second chance.  I hope it finds an audience on DVD.  Hopefully it will justify a Director's edition.  Kurt Wimmer is definately a Director worth watching.

The best songs I think is \\"Gotta Make It To Heaven\\" and \\"Many Men\\". And there are a few songs that are really hot like \\"High All The Time\\", \\"Patiently Wating\\" (eminem is damn hot in this song) and \\"like my style\\". Peaple that are gona buy this cd, better listen to these tracks. 50 cents cd is way better than JaRules [songs]...

0393057658|4.0|Michael Lewis is a great author, and really goes inside a war room in baseball. I love books about sports, and i sometimes aspire to be a baseball GM, and such.<br />Yet i don't believe the Lews portrays many characters correctly. For example Grady Fuson (the A's old Scouting Director) drafted the likes of great pros like: Barry Zito, Tim Hudson, Mark Mulder, and Eric Chavez. Lewis gives him absolutely no credit.<br />Also Assistant GM Paul DePodesta has said that Lewis can over dramatize some of the things they talked about, (like the importance of stats). Lewis also doesnt state that the A's drafted some guys too high, because they couldn't afford the best guys on the market.<br />With all that said Moneyball is a very good read, and takes you right to the GM's office Of a great franchise
B00003CY6M|4.0|Adorable &amp; funny romantic movie. A movie to watch with your guy/lady......just the two of you. The movie seems to go by so fast because there's always something good happening in most scenes. Based in the past 20 years, this movie would be in my top 10 Funny Romantic Comedy List. What a great friend Molly Shannon (former cast in SNL) is in this movie. As for not giving all 5 stars rating: dvd movies should be available in Full Screen as well.   ...or even better: every dvd movie comes in both full and widescreen (just to make everyone happy). That's probably the only neg. thing I can say about the DVD feature, but the actual movie is great!
B000021XS0|5.0|Regardless of how many people are turned off by the vocals or long song arrangments, progressive rock fans have made Scenes from a Memory just as important to the music world as classics such as Close to the Edge or In the Court of the Crimson King, even possibly Dark Side of the Moon. <br />Dream Theater takes you on epic journey through murder and reincarnation on \\"Scenes\\", with some of the most impressive instrumental chops ever recorded. Songs like \\"Overture 1928\\", \\"Strange Deja Vu\\", and \\"One Last Time\\" showcase the incredible beauty and emotion in which Dream Theater pour into their music, while others such as \\"Home\\" and \\"The Dance of Eternity\\" lead you through odd time signatures, blistering solos, and unique phrasings that further showcase their overwhelming talent. <br />I think that Scenes from a Memory shows Dream Theater at the height of their maturity, where each member is finally able to weave all of his individual talent into a perfectly balanced musical vision. The addition of new keyboard player Jordan Rudess and his compositional skills undoubtedly helped bring about this, accounting for some of the incredible focus found on \\"Scenes\\".<br />James LaBrie's vocals are at their best yet; he is showing much more restraint than on Awake and other previous efforts. John Petrucci and John Myung deliver their usual phenomenal string work, and Mike absolutely shreds. There are only a few parts in which I think Dream Theater \\"overplays\\" in; the \\"horn\\" and oriental parts could have been left off \\"Beyond This Life\\", and the \\"Dance of Eternity\\" could have been shorter, but these minor problems aren't enough to take away from the near-perfection of one of the finest releases ever.

B000021XS0|5.0|Ah, where do you begin to find words worthy enough to possibly convey the emotions of this album? As it has been said countless times in previous reviews, this is about as close to perfection as music gets, worthy of a seat next to the likes of \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and other masterpieces. <br />Each member of Dream Theater has discovered the almost endless possibilities to which his instrument is capable of being pushed and is able to weave his individual talent into a collective musical understanding without sacrificing pefect symmetry OR beauty. In a time where a large majority of music is fueled by commercialism and reduced to simplicity, Dream Theater is not afraid to challenge the music world to sit and ponder the complexity of their music.<br />Dream Theater takes you on epic journey through murder and reincarnation on \\"Scenes\\", with some of the most impressive instrumental chops ever recorded.

Not to say that this album doesn't have its faults; the \\"horn\\" and oriental parts could have been left off \\"Beyond This Life\\", and that the ballads could have possibly been reworked, but these minor problems aren't enough to take away from the near-perfection of one of the finest releases ever.
B00005KB9W|4.0|One of the remarkable things about the work of the late Mr. Marley is that if you ask people or look at Web and newsgroup reviews and opinions as to which was his best album, there are no definitive anwers.<br />If you want a collection, then Legend in its latest form might be the one for you, but the 4-disc Songs of Freedom set is a great collection if you can afford it, and One Love may be a better single CD collection than Legend (at least it has 4 more tracks).<br />Then there are a whole slew of studio albums from the astonishingly productive years of the mid and late seventies, for each of which there is someone to say that this is THE Bob Marley album. (I suspect that people, and this includes myself, as most strongly disposed towards the first Marley album they hear. First love is always the sweetest, I suppose.)<br />Then there are the live albums, and even there the competition between Live! and Babylon By Bus is intense. Leaving out the consideration that Live! at thirty-odd minutes and seven tracks is a bit short, truth is there is not a lot to choose.<br />Live! shows Marley and the band on peak form in performance in London, and here you have a nice example of a master performer perfectly in tune with an adoring audience, which at times is singing along en masse, giving a semblance of a soccer match crowd.<br />There is an especially wonderful and moving rendition of No Woman No Cry, and the other tracks are not shabby either.<br />All in all a very nice album to own and one I can heartily recommend to Marley fans, though I would not make it my first Marley purchase, and perhaps not even my first Marley live album purchase either, though ultimately these things are a question of personal taste.<br />*  A really worthless CD<br />** A CD that has some good stuff, but some major defects.<br />***  An OK CD that will please fans of the artist in question.<br />****  An excellent CD that represents the best work of the artist in question and can be bought with confidence.<br />***** An absolute classic that is the best, or among the best, of its genre.

0440211727|5.0|A Time to Kill, a story of a distraught father of a 10-year-old rape victim who takes justice into his own hands, will have you unable to put it down.<BR>It's mid-summer in Clanton, Mississippi in the 1990's. Carl Lee Hailey opens fire on the two rapists in the town courthouse. Everyone knows he did it. It's up to Jake Brigance, a young, beginner lawyer, to save Hailey from the gas chamber. The small town already has its problems with racism and this magnifies the hatred.<BR>The blacks of the town praise Hailey for his heroic action and show their support by forming picket lines, holding marches, and shouting \\"Free Carl Lee!\\" The whites of the town show their opinion of Hailey by also forming picket lines and shouting just the opposite, \\"Fry Carl Lee!\\" Some even go to the extreme of forming a Clanton chapter of the Ku Klux Klan and burning crosses. The tension in the town causes a riot in the town square and the National Guard to come in. Jake, and his team of a drunk, disbarred ex-lawyer, a young, beautiful female law student, and a sleazy divorce lawyer whom Jake calls best friend, work together on the biggest case ever to hit Clanton.<BR>Grisham did such a good job in getting me involved that I was constantly pullinh for Jake. I grew to despise the prosecuting team, and I kept getting angry when an obstacle got in the way of Jake's success. At one instance in the story where Jake's best friend is a smart mouth to the prosecutor, I found myself laughing out loud.<br />Written in an episodic style A Time to Kill succeeds in keeping my attention. With a simple and easy plot to follow and no symbolism in sight, this book will have you reading for hours. Grisham does a delightful job on his first novel.
B000089RVX|1.0|Uh huh, what next, gothic boyband gangsta rap? I've heard better female soprano vocals elsewhere (i.e., Dido, Sinead O Connor, Tori Amos) and see no other reason this band found promotion other than possible corporate assumption that all 3 styles, above, would broaden the marketing target.<br /> If you want GREAT duo female/male vocals (over dark gloomy music, of course) check out In a Reverie or Comalies by Lacuna Coil, Lucid Dreaming or Vovin by Therion, or Beyond the Veil by Tristania.
B000000OPW|5.0|I had only heard singles by Siouxsie when I bought this cd on a whim, and it's still hands-down one of my absolute favorite albums. It's consistent without becoming boring or repetitive, it really makes the album an experience as opposed to a collection of songs.<br />&quot;Lands End&quot; is a delicious tune, easy to just lay back and get lost in. &quot;Umbrella&quot; seethes and twitches in an understated way that makes it probably my favorite song on the cd. I have to say, though, I feel the album falters a bit during &quot;Quarterdrawing&quot; and &quot;The Execution&quot;. They're certainly not out of place but I can't say I'd really miss them if they were gone.<br />That one gripe doesn't detract much at all from the overall presence of Tinderbox, so I have to give it a full 5 stars. This is prime Siouxsie material.
B00003CX9E|5.0|First and formost, this is an entertaining movie. (...) Citizen Kane is on my top three list, not because is \\"supposed to be\\", but because I honestly enjoyed watching it. And that's the number one priority...is it enjoyable.<BR>The script was outstanding. I thought the flashbacks of different people's perspectives of various points in Kane's life was a great idea.<BR>Excellent acting, excellent music, excellent cinematography...<BR>The fact that Welles never directed a movie before is amazing! If he had done an average movie about Hearst, he still would have had the same reaction and noteriety at the time, but it would have been mostly forgotten today. If he had shown up and produced just a really good movie, it would have been noted in film history as an acheivement, but the film would be little viewed. <BR>But no, he showed up, produced a masterpiece (can't call it the greatest ever, too subjective).<BR>Forget Rosebud. That's not the point of the movie. It's just an excuse to explore the man's life.<BR>Watch the movie with no preconcieved notions about it being the greatest movie ever. Just watch it. You'll enjoy it.
B00004U8P9|5.0|Who could ask for anything more than Tim Curry in fishnets? This movie may be extremely campy but, it is one of my all-time favorites. While the plot may be stupid, the movie is the extreme genius of Richard O'Brien. How he came up with this - I will never know - but, I don't think I would ever want to (it might ruin the magic for me). <BR>  The story of a young couple stranded late one night because of a flat tire who find their way to the castle of Dr. Frank-n-Furter and his 'people'. Brad and Janet go through the &quot;Time Warp&quot; and get to meet Rocky before the strange night is over. Magenta will always be my favorite! <BR>  This movie is one to have forever. It's a good party movie as well as the perfect Halloween movie for you and your twisted friends. If you've never seen it - I suggest you watch it as soon as humanly possible.
B000002P5W|5.0|Are You Experienced had more hits, Electric Ladyland had more favorable reviews, but Axis: Bold As Love is just as strong as both of them. Each track blends into the next effortlessly mixing harder riff rockers and soulful poppier fare. One thing you definitely notice on this album is the Experience were the perfect backing band for Hendrix, always providing the perfect amount of restraint and the right amount of aggressiveness, depending on the track. Jimi Hendrix's songwriting was already growing by leaps and bounds on this, his second release. \\"Little Wing\\" is the bonafide classic of this album. Jimi's singing and laid back guitar playing is an excellent example of his matured songwriting. \\"Castles Made of Sand\\" and \\"One Rainy Wish\\" continue in this vein, as the beauty of Jimi's softer playing makes these Hendrix classics.  There's plenty of the fire that dominates Are You Experienced here also. 'If 6 was 9\\", is an excellent track, complete with Jimi's killer guitar playing and talk vocals, and Mitch Mitchell's aggressive drumming. The riff rockers which are all underrated and killer include \\"Ain't No Telling\\", \\"Little Miss Lover\\", \\"Spanish Castle Magic\\", and \\"She's So Fine\\", which is sung by bassist Noel Redding. \\"Wait Until Tomorrow\\" is an excellent track as well and could have been a hit single. The album closes with \\"Bold As Love\\", one of the best ballads he ever recorded, which is a perfect way to close the album. This is an excellent addition to any rock music collection.

I wonder how many of the actors in this movie would want their children to watch it.Thanks for listening!!!!

B00008S2VG|5.0|I am not a musician, and I may not be the best critic when it comes to Madonna because I've always thought she's great.  I agree with a lot of people saying that American Life is not her greatest album, yet, I think this is not a bad CD at all.  I'm afraid she's doing something that most of us don't know how to do (or maybe don't want to), accept our own mistakes.  The message in the album is good, I call that evolution.  Musically it is all packed together very good, the songs follow one another smoothly.  May not be as danceable as we want to, but it provides a good mix of acoustic guitars, electronic sounds and her voice.<BR>About the rap in American Life and the tone in Mother and Father, well, that's Madonna, don't ever expect her to be static, without trying something different.  As good as Ray of Light is (maybe the best) if this album sounded the same, it wouldn't be her 'new' material

B00003CXI1|1.0|The characters, the story, everything is stupid in this movie. I wasn't to impressed by the eye candy either. This movie makes me sick.
0375823360|3.0|I found this series mildly entertaining primarily due to the author's use of alternate worlds and the adventures encountered by the witches, wizards, bad guys, gypsies and the other assortment of characters. Unfortunately the primary character, 11 year-old Lyra, is dreadfully difficult to care about. She is unfailingly rude, disobedient and unpleasant. The few forays into an attempt to show her vulnerable, agreeable side are handled clumsily and in some cases outside the realm of logic. The author insists on making her ally exclusively herself with boys rather than other girls, perhaps to emphasize that she is a tomboy. Adding fuel to the male-good, female-bad fire is the fact that her mother is portrayed as Satan herself and many of the adult male characters are drawn as heroic and self-sacrificing. The plot also veers a bit, people appear and leave, sometimes forever, without explanation. Quests become interrupted or foiled and are never reattempted or concluded. Finally, unlike Harry Potter, there is an amazing lack of racial diversity in these books. Except for some northern dwellers who may or may not be Inuit, everyone is described as white.It seems with this author whatever world you happen to find yourself color will be confined to sunsets and the northern lights.

B000002J1H|5.0|this was the release with Rick Wakeman back in the lineup and let me tell you he puts his stamp all over the CD.  It is great, and the song AWAKEN is worth the price of admission alone, but there is not a bad song on the CD.  Buy this one and yours will not be disgrace.
B000002USN|3.0|Frank Sinatra \\"retired\\" for the second time after his 1984 album \\"L.A. is My Lady\\" and it was almost a decade before he returned to the studio for another comeback. From a commercial standpoint, this 1993 \\"Duets\\" album was a huge success, selling over 2 million copies and making it to #2 on the Billboard charts. From an artistic standpoint it is a mixed bag at best. The fact that Sinatra recorded his tracks first and then the other thirteen artists recorded their tracks at different time and in different places is rather bizarre since it violates some of the basic principles that made Sinatra one of the greatest recording artists of the 20th century (yes, the classic \\"Saturday Night Live\\" sketch where Sinatra is running his singing partners through the studio as quickly as possible was all made up). Sinatra was in his late 70s at this point, and while he still knew what to do with the phrasing of a line, his voice was not always up to the effort; when he sings the last song on the album, \\"One for My Baby (And One More for the Road),\\" the greatest of the many saloon songs he sang in his career, the way in which time had ravaged his voice is very clear and painful to hear, at least for me. The performance is but a shadow of the man and his music.<br />The other thing that is painful about this album is the thought of what would have happened if this had been done the right way twenty or even ten years earlier. The thought of Sinatra and Tony Bennett in the studio singing \\"New York, New York\\" together at the same time is just a choice example of \\"what might have been.\\" Imagine Barbra Streisand and Bono taking their songs seriously instead of camping them up. Imagine Sinatra singing with Aretha Franklin when they both were fully capable of bringing their A games. For that matter, imagine what if the orchestrations had been toned down so they were not trying to cover up the limitations of the mixed vocals. Instead we have these dozen duets (Kenny G does \\"All the Way\\" on the final track before Sinatra shows up and sings \\"One for My Babe\\"), and it is just a question of what appeals to you. I actually like Bennett on \\"New York, New York,\\" and the songs with Gloria Estefan (\\"Come Rain or Come Shine\\"), Natalie Cole (\\"They Can't Take That Away From Me\\"), and Carly Simon (the medley \\"Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out to Dry\\"/\\"In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning\\") are enjoyable tracks. But I cannot take the Bono track (\\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\") seriously, and Julio Iglesias seems strangely muted to me on his (\\"Summer Wind\\"). But on balance it is hard not to be sad by this collection of duets, not only by the way they were put together but by the thought of what this album done in the right way at the right time would have been.the final track before Sinatra shows up and sings \\"One for My Babe\\"), and it is just a question of what appeals to you.

We were truly caught with our pants down.The Japanese had an awesome naval defense, and I was puzzled how they devasted our naval defenses and did not finish the attack. This Pearl Harbor is the best movie ever,there is no contest. This one you have to see for yourself, why I rated it so high. God Bless those who rose up and still fought despite the overwhelming casualties and serious disadvantage.

Before he became an author he worked 60-70 hours a week at a law practice.  His first hit was the firm and it was huge.  john also writes law books.  some other books that he has written was A Time to Kill and the Chamber.<br />Evaluation:  The book the Pelican Brief was one  of the best books i have ever read.  I thought the book made you think, and try to figure out the next twist in the book.  i never got lost durring the book which i normaly do, so the author did a great job to catch my attention.  My favorite part of the book was the part when Thomas is blown up in his car and Darby was with the killer taht said he was a cop.  that forces her to go on the run knowing that someone is out to kill her.  the book was put together great and i would give it a 5 on a scale of 1 to 5.  That is my evaluation of the Pelican Brief.

B00005JL78|3.0|Philip K. Dick may very well be Hollywood's favorite science fiction writer.  By now, you're probably familiar with the litany of movies based on his short fiction-\\"Blade Runner,\\" \\"Scanners,\\" \\"Total Recall.\\"  And this.  Even Spielberg apparently finds inspiration in the man's ideas.   Too bad Dick is too dead to reap the rewards.  I understand he wasn't quite so successful when he was alive.<br /> While Philip K. Dick was a writer of science fiction, with rare exceptions (\\"2001,\\" \\"Solaris,\\" \\"Gattaca,\\" \\"The Truman Show\\") the film industry is unable to make anything other than sci-fi.  Which is to say, they make the same movies they always make, while simply co-opting the more superficial science fictional tropes.  \\"Minority Report\\" is not an exception.  This is a Steven Spielberg-directed thriller first; it is science fiction second.<br />The premise is that three clairvoyants have been found who see, in their dreams, murders before they happen.  Their abilities, and to a significant degree their humanity, have been co-opted by a corporation called \\"Pre-Crime,\\" which in a groundbreaking experiment has been allowed to preempt these murders in the Washington, D.C. area for the past several years.  The result:  many hundreds, if not thousands, of would-be murderers placed in some sort of deep-freeze and thus removed from society-a society in which the act of murder is a distant memory.  Tom Cruise's character is the most senior of Pre-Crime's enforcers, an expert at reading clues and evidence from the clairvoyants' dreams and at dropping in on the murder scene, preferably (for cinematic purposes) at the last minute, to stop the dastardly act from occurring.  He is presented with something of a problem, however, when the latest prediction has him clearly portrayed as the murderer.  He goes on the run, then on a quest to clear himself and get to the bottom of his own mystery.<br />It's a great idea, worthy of Philip K. Dick.  At times, it's executed brilliantly.  Spielberg teamed up with Stanley Kubrick in the preparations for filming \\"A.I.,\\" and in that film as well as this one the Kubrickian influence on Spielberg's style has been obvious and welcome.  The first third or so of \\"Minority Report\\" is almost like a Kubrick film without the inhuman bleakness; it's Kubrick with sympathetic characters.  One wishes Spielberg could stick with it, but he can't.  There has to be a ridiculous, digitally-enhanced chase scene to kick things into a higher gear--and really, is there anyone who is actually excited by this sort of \\"action\\" anymore?  I was absolutely bored by it.  There has to be an even more ridiculous scene where one of the clairvoyants nearly channels Cruise's dead son (although her contribution to another chase scene is more entertaining).  Pre-Crime presents a potentially heady brew of issues for consideration:  how can someone be guilty of a pre-empted murder?  Is it possible that they might have chosen not to commit their intended offense?  What is the legal basis for the dehumanizing of the clairvoyants, who are essentially robbed of their lives?  The characters of Cruise and Colin Farrell briefly debate such matters, but neither delves very deeply.  Such superficial treatment leaves some gaping holes in the basic premise of the film-after all, the success of Pre-Crime in averting the predicted murders is proof that what is foretold is not certain to occur, but no one in the film seems to be aware of this rather obvious argument.<br />Without giving too much away, the final choice presented in the film's climactic scene, while genuine, is brought about in a ridiculous way, with Cruise's character potentially sacrificing himself in a way no real person would dare.  This makes for a hollow ending.  Kubrick's influence apparently cannot overcome Spielberg's intense need to pander, to glue on a sticky-sweet ending no matter how much weaker the film may be as a result (a tendency that was just as egregious in \\"A.I.\\")  \\"Minority Report\\" has an interesting premise and some fine execution, but in the end it's another Spielberg film.  You know what you're getting into.
B0000039QA|4.0|One of the best put CD's ever assembled! A must have.
B00007KQA3|5.0|...I believe it is essential to read the novel then watch the movie.  If you have seen the movie without reading the novel you should read it and then go back and watch the movie.  I agree that it is almost impossible to translate a novel into celluloid but I believe the pathos this movie exudes is breathtaking.  It is stark, melancholic and disturbingly close to Orwell's vision.  Radford drew from the core of the literary creation and gave his movie pungent and decadent life.  Orwell would have approved of the movie but not of the world's current state of affairs, which he had himself predicted...
068485743X|4.0|After reading Immediate Fiction by Jerry Cleaver, I admit my expectations were very high for Lukeman's book, especially in light of the excellent reviews it got here. I was somewhat disappointed. While The First Five Pages does a great job of outlining common mistakes in writing (generally speaking, not just in the opening pages), it falls short in the How Do I Fix It department. Yes, it discusses the Dos vs. the Don'ts but it left me unsure how I go about recognizing the problems in my own work or the process of how to fix them. Just showing examples doesn't work for me. I need a process: here's what you look for, here's what you do when you find it. That's what I found in Cleaver's book, but I did not find it here. If you learn well from examples of Dos and Don'ts, this book might be very helpful. If you want to learn a process, go with Jerry Cleaver.
B00008BXJF|5.0|I was fortunate enough to see them live in Phila. on the tour that supported this album; if you think this is an album of studio tricks, you're gravely mistaken.  Every nuance was reproduced in gritty detail which was an amazing experience.  I've followed this band since 1978 and have seen them live on seven tours, they've still got it and are maturing like a fine wine. Enjoy this album and support this Band!
0064430227|5.0|I told my mother about this book for years after having read it in kindergarten. She had never seen it. Well, this classic children's book is back in print, and even my mother now knows what the fuss was all about.<br />Harold is a boy chock full of imagination. He meanders about with just his purple crayon, creating his surroundings. He draws himself into situtations, and has to keep his wits about him in order to draw himself out of any trouble that results in his adventures.<br />My 4 boys always seemed to like that Harold could extract himself from whatever messes he got himself into. They are fun books, with adventures, but they end on a calming note. They are perfect for bedtime, as they don't wind the children up, but they do hold their interest. (There is a whole series of Harold and the Purple Crayon books) So, for good clean fun, as long as your little ones know not to draw on walls Harold is a never fail hit. My Harold books are all well read.
B0000028M7|5.0|The thing about Alice in Chains is, all three of their LPs are different from one another.  Facelift is basically a great metal record.  Layne Staley sounds alot different, Jerry Cantrell doesn't do backing vocals as much.  Tripod is the grinding, sludge-fest of melodies and harmonies, not to mention written primarily by Staley.  And in the middle, we have Dirt. The dark, disturbing grunge record that made Alice in Chains famous.  This baby ties with Tripod for the 'darkest grunge album' title.  Check out 'Hate to Feel' and 'Sickman.'  Dirt has the best guitar and bass of the three LPs if you ask me.  The base on 'Would?' is manic.  The guitar on 'Hate to Feel' is kickass.  <br />Them Bones - Good opener, nice chorus, too.  <BR>Dam that river - Good track, but kind of weak compared to the others.<BR>Rain when I die - Creative song!  One of the best off the album.<BR>Down in a hole - Awesome song, one of the three best.<BR>Sickman - Nice how it seems to be a different song in the chorus.<BR>Rooster - Great song about Vietnam and Cantrell's dad.  great lyrics.<BR>Junkhead - Awesome song.  Great guitars, too!<BR>Dirt - Weakest off the album.  Doesn't appeal to me, I guess.<BR>Godsmack - I kinda wish they hadn't made this song.  While being kickass, the band Godsmack wouldn't be created if it weren't for this.<BR>(Track 10) - Ok, from here, the album starts to rock extremely.  The last 3 tracks are the best of Dirt.  <BR>Hate to Feel - Best guitar on the album.  Powerfull and grindy. <BR>Angry chair - YEAAA!  Great bass, great song.  I don't think it should have been on 'Unplugged' though.<BR>Would? - The best track.  Mike Starr plays the bass like a madman on speed.  They saved the best for last, yo.<br />So I guess I'm torn.  Tripod(AiC) and Dirt are about even in terms of rocking-ness.  Both are great in their own ways.  Ah well.  Guess that's what makes AiC great.
0394800184|5.0|First of all, let me tell those of you who are having, or just had your first child, ignore the baby book advice that babies don't like books without bright colors. I am a mother of 4, and this book is in the top 5 books requested by the boys. It may look rather somber compared to the latest releases, but the kids love this one.<br />This book is a wonderful story of a little bird on a serious quest. He shows such determination and perseverence. There is no stopping this little bird.<br />The book is short enough to hold a child's attention at a very young age. Young children love books with a repetitive banter, and this book fulfills that criterion without annoying the adults.<br />It is a great book to snuggle up with, with a great, positive ending. I can bet that you will get years of reading out of this little book.
B000084T18|2.0|50's new album is not good, not downright awful, just OK. He has his moments lyrically, but most of the album is uninspired. He is definitely not as talented as some other rappers out there.<BR>The best part about this album was its production. Dr. Dre is a talented producer, and his contributions are what save this album from eternal [doom].
0393057658|4.0|it's always interesting to see someone deconstruct anything and put it back together in a way that makes you see things totally differently than conventional wisdom. The story fo the 2002 A's does that.<br />The one unanswerable question I had that Lewis never answered was-what happens when EVERYONE in baseball adopts something closer to Beane's sicientific approach?  Will his present advantage disappear or will he adjust his approach again? <BR>That's a relatively minor quibble. This is a great read. <br />I would only note while the Mets are now a mess, Kazmir, the high school pitcher that Beane passed on, is having a great season. We'll see.
0446677450|2.0|I recently purchased this book and found it to be generally on point in terms of concepts but very very short on substance.  The author appears to have built his fortune using real estate, yet he provides little in the way of information regarding how to analyze and evaluate potential real estate deals.  He talks a lot about hanging around courthouses and lawyers offices to buy distressed real estate, but provides few details.  (Perhaps he plans to go into these details in his next book---a way of keeping folks coming back to the trough and spending money).  This book will no doubt inspire some, but is of little use for those already endowed with sufficient inspiration but need detailed practical information regarding viable opportunities to pursue.<br />Moreover, as a CPA, I find he's overreaching in his assertion that corporations can be used to write off non deductible personal expenses.  Although there may be ways of setting up non taxable fringes like car allowances and etc., most corporate taxpayers aren't writing off excessive amounts of personal expenses.  Of course, if this sort of thing was okay, then hotel magnet Leona Helmsley would not have spent time in jail for writing off her expenditures for personal furniture and the like on her corporate tax returns.  The information he offers about escaping taxation by operating corporately is just plain wrong and I'm surprised that the CPA that co authored the book didn't provide better advice in this area.<br />There are better books out there even for inspiration.  The Millionaire Next Door is much better if one is looking for inspiraton along with some general practical advice in how to manage one's money and escape the consumerism trap to free up dollars to invest.
B00005JLT5|5.0|I just saw the pianist a couple of weeks ago. I saw it because i was really interested in knowing how Adrien Brody's performance could have been any better than Daniel Day-Lewis's perfomance in Gangs of New York. WHen i saw this film, i was shocked at the beginning. No film i had ever seen about the holocaust had touched me so much, and make me realize the atrocious things the jews passed through. Adrien Brody's perfomance was spectacular!! He deserved 110% the oscar he won. The directing oscar was very well deserved too. This film shows how extreme and devastating the holoucast was. I've always cosidered the holoucast the most horrible and unhuman things in history... and this film made me realiza that i was right. Few films have touched me in such a deep way, so i hope you all see it. Even though is a really tough film to see, i recomend it to everyone. I can't way until it comes out!! It is one of the best movies ever made!!
B000002UAR|5.0|My all-time favorite Beatles album. These arrangements are obviously sparse (compared to the many following Beatles' albums), but that's the charm. Every song is dripping with catchy melodies and cool guitar riffs. A very versatile album with great lyrics and songwriting. Harrison contributes some great songs as well (as he almost always did). This would be the first Beatles' album I would recommend if you want to start a first-rate collection (others being Rubber Soul, White Album, and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band).
B00008PBZW|1.0|To have taken such a fascinating story and turned it into such a piece of blancmange is sheer artistic incompetence. Windtalkers is a prime example of a director with no knowledge of - or indeed interest in - the realities of combat. At no point in the film is there even a suggestion that Wu was concerned about accuracy. The characters are cliched, the sets are straight out of the 1950s, the action is stilted and unconvincing. Rather than a *rating of 1-5, there should be a set of minus ratings for this film. Windtalkers is embarrasingly bad.
B000066I6N|5.0|Plant's renditions of these truely awesome classics, are given new life. I've always been a fan of his unique voice and his band is really solid. My personal favs on this album would include:<BR>Darkness Darkness (this is the highlight and definitely the best song on here, though they're all great), Morning Dew (the only version I had heard beforehand was the Jeff Beck Group - which was a bit more funkier, this is the version i like the best tho), Hey Joe (who hasn't heard the original Hendrix version? this takes the material a little more seriously and makes parts a bit more intense - with a few token Hendrix riffs), and One More Cup of Coffee (which has a very latin feel to it that's apparent from the beginning and of course the songwriting skills of Dylan!). <BR>Through the years I've been an average fan of Plant's solo work (tho one of my favorite bands of all time is Led Zeppelin). I haven't heard all of his albums, but from the ones I have heard this would probably be the best (except for maybe Fate of Nations). This album has alot of variation, I was definitely surprised.
0446677450|5.0|The authors question conventional paths such as working for money and home owenership for the acquisition of net worth. This encourages you to consider and explore different options. Fear of risk is defined as a large obstacle. Most people are unskilled at handling risk (and rarely know how to make the most of risk) because they have been taught that it is best to be optimistic. When the price and/or probability of failure are high, optimism is a bad strategy. If you are interested in OPTIMIZING your financial success, you have to read &quot;Optimal Thinking-How to Be Your best self&quot; by Rosalene Glickman, Ph.D. She takes you past wishful thinking and shows you how to be your best and optimize risk in every situation, and how to take the most constructive path to reach your goals. Optimal Thinking is simple and you can put it into practice IMMEDIATELY to maximize your success. Glickman teaches you how to ask the best questions of yourself and others to obtain optimum results. I recommend both of these books. Keep them close and you'll have all you need.
B000088E6D|5.0|This cd is great I listen to it all the time.
B00004XONN|5.0|When you first listen to Kid A - the first reaction is what the F is this??!?  There are a few songs that pop out as distinct and innovative but there is all this wierd filler and moaning.<br />In a few weeks you will be in AWE.  This is a musical milestone mixing the classic meanderings of Pink Floyd with modern sounds, loops, and saxamphones.  Tom Yorke sings with his soul and although many lyrics are cryptic in meaning they are sure memorable!<br />Put this album on in the dark through headphones and you can hear the amazing production quality.  They must have know this album was going to be an epic....the inside of the CD case is just shiney black (like Spinal Tap!)...very ominous.
B00008H2LB|5.0|&quot;Meteora&quot; continues the trend that has set Linkin Park apart. Although, to some hardcore rock/metal fans, Linkin Park might just be another TRL, MTV-band, they have done something that's not easy to do, and that is that they've created a CD in which a lot of listeners can relate too. The lyrics and musics of ALL the tracks on this CD are very well done. A major plus which I found about &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; is that every single track on the CD could be a single, not just &quot;In The End&quot;. The same idea applies to &quot;Meteora&quot;. Although, some music listeners might become inundated with Linkin Park's presence on the radio-waves, don't let this over-playing shy you away from their music. Every track on &quot;Meteora&quot; has a unique sound to it, not too dark as Tool or Godsmack, and it does not have that made-for-radio sound as well, it's Nu-Metal. They have talent (could be a little better live), and hopefully, they'll make a 3rd CD that won't disappoint either.
B00005QIPH|4.0|This is a GREAT album but at first I thought all the tunes sounded the same like many other reviewers.     GOOD ALBUMS GROW ON YOU!  It's not too often you realized excellent music initially (Kid A is a prime example)  Each song has very different arrangements and the \\"pop - punk\\" guitar riffs work well. Casablancas sounds like old-school Iggy Pop, which [is good].    This is one of the best rock albums in a few years and their live performance shows how great of a band they are and what all the hype is about
B000000P11|5.0|Mad Jack?  Two versions of Tears?  Swamp Thing?  <BR>My friend Erik said it best, when he said:  Du-ijsh!!!    <BR>  Not intended for the emotionally bereft...This is one of the finest albums you'll ever enjoy, if you're willing to give it a chance.  Once you realize how clever and moody the tunes are, you feel as if you are privy to a well-kept secret.  The music does not hold mass appeal, because it was not engineered to meet the boring standards upheld by today's music industry.  <BR>  The guitars sound like they are being played by two men, at the opposite ends of a canyon's echo, in complete unison (it's hard to describe).  The lead singer's voice has an odd, distinct character that fits well in the context of the lyrics.  I kind of get an \\"on-the-verge-of-creepy\\" vibe from the Chameleons, that I also get from Lynch/Kubrick films.  Most everyone I've known who's given this record a chance, will attest to the inherent sweetness of Strange Times.  Mullethead rockers, ambient spaced-out stoners, pop nerd hook-junkies and weasels from the neutral zone:  FREE YOUR MIND
0385720920|3.0|This book had an intersesting premise but was very choppy comapred to Chuck's other work.  It was very explicative (which I don't mind when it adds to they story but it seemed like it was more for shock value).  All in all a quickly forgotten novel but keeps your attention.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This has become my favorite movie. I rented Sprited Away on thursday evening, watched it, with great amazement at today's advanced animation technology. I couldn't get it out of my head all week, untill I finally bought it. <BR> The animation is superb, the characters really grow on you ( Chihiro is adorable, as she grws greatly as a person, alongside with a bunch of whacky characters that make you laugh and cry at the same time)I loved the lenght of this movie, so anyone who thinks that 125 minutes of pure bliss is intimidating, really shouldnt think that.<BR>This is a true work of art, worthy it's oscar time a hundread and I cannot stop watching it. Great stuff.
B00005JLRT|1.0|This is the first time I have ever reviewed a movie at Amazon. That should tell you something. This movie was a complete letdown. The film's creator's obviously decided to look at the best film in the series, The Wrath of Khan, and then copy everything about it. Let's take a madman with a grudge against the captain, give him the ultimate weapon, and turn him loose. Along the way, let's rehash the 'Data having a twin storyline' and act like Lore never existed. Which means of course, they immediately put B4 together and he tries to take over the ship. Then, let's kill off one of the characters only to set it up so we can waste the next movie bringing him back. Pretty obvious Brent Spiner had a hand in writing this film....And someone answer me this. Why would an entire race follow a human clone? And how does someone raised in filth and ignorance in a mine get hold of the most powerful warship ever built and learn how to command it? This movie has sworn me off of Star Trek Movies for ever. I can see how the average movie watcher might like this movie, but how could any Treker possibly stomach this?!?!?!?
B000089RVX|4.0|they sound very much like Lacuna Coil. This is not a bad thing, I just wonder why this band has gotten so big when Lacuna Coil is still very much an underground band.
B00007BH5C|2.0|First, just because a movie is good doesn't automatically make a soundtrack worthwhile. I try to give objective review of soundtracks, judging them on two issues:<BR>   1. How does the music integrate with the movie?<BR>   2. How does the music sound on its own?<BR>The music in the two towers was well integrated with the move; it rounded out the battles, dark sequences and quaintness of the hobbits etc... (I ought to know, having seen the movie three times)<br />However, on its own, the music in this soundtrack form just doesn't impress me. I liked the last one (Fellowship) more, because it had the quaint music of the hobbits, which would stay focused, but this one tends to ramble along, changing haphazardly from theme to theme as the camera moves around.<br />I think that, to a point, this track is overrated by people who just loved the movie. This doesn't happen with every movie, but many fantasy/science fiction films get die hard fans, and this movie has an extra dose of them. (kind of like \\"trekkies\\") I have some friends who love this movie to the exclusion of others. I have seen \\"frodo_4's\\" and \\"lotr_fan's\\" on movie forums saying things like, \\"The lotr is more emotional than schindler's list.\\"<BR>Sorry, Frodo_4, but you may need to get over it...<BR>sorry to break this to you, but you know this issue of good and evil? It HAS been tackled before, and it will be tackled again.<BR>THE LOTR is NOT the first \\"worthwhile epic\\" etc...<BR>Anyways, back to the soundtrack; it really is not that awesome, although it is quite well integrated with the movie...<BR>Go pick up a John Williams soundtrack...<BR>Much better, and theres tons of 'em :-)
B000002J09|5.0|This album has transcended it's time to become one of the biggest selling records of all time (according to the RIAA, it's at 22 million and counting).  It's certainly Zeppelin's most polished album (which annoyed some of their fans), and it is a collection of perfect songs.<br />  &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; is the bands most well known song for a reason.  At just over 8 minutes, it's scope, ambition and epic nature combined with the (incredible well known) opening and ending guitar riff, it's one of the definitive songs of it's era.  It achieves a pure pop mysticism that can't be ignored, no matter how often you hear it.  Don't listen to it for a month, or 2 or 3.  Then slip it in the CD (or MP3) player again.  Heady, brilliant stuff.  That said, this CD is more than just Stairway.  &quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot; with the Tolkein references and fever pitch is an absolute masterpiece.  Those are probably my two favourite songs on the album, but every single one is incredible. Black Dogs is a hugely energetic opener, and When the Levee Breaks ranks as on of the most astonishing album enders ever.  It sounds like Blues, but is much more 'symphonic' and grand that it transcends the genre.<br />  Is this a desert island disk?  For me personally, yes.  What a great album!
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne, a nineteen-year-old newcomer from Napanee, Canada, has made her way up the charts. Avril sings Punk Rock music, and has revolutionized the fashion world with her skater look, that consists of a tie and many arm bands. Her first single, \\"Complicated\\" brought her into the music scene, followed by \\"Sk8er Boi,\\" \\"I'm with you,\\" and her newest hit \\"Losing Grip.\\"  She has other popular songs on the album; such as \\"Anything But Ordinary\\" and \\"Things I'll Never Say.\\" \\"Anything But Ordinary,\\" which promotes individuality, reminds me of a sense of explanation. \\"Things I'll Never Say\\" provides a hidden lesson, that you should say and do what you have to before you miss your chance and regret it for the rest of your life. Avril wrote all thirteen songs on the album, because she wanted it to be \\"her thing, her way.\\"  I think she did a great job, being her first C.D., and I look forward to more to come. Let Go is one of my favorite c.d.'s of all time. All of her songs have a strong meaning or a story behind them.  Avril Lavigne has become such a big star, and even has her own trademark; a simple, lopsided star.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I'll be the first to admit that I wasn't thrilled with this album when I initially listened to the title track \\"American Life\\". It just isn't the album's strong point and I'm a little incredulous that she released that particular single first. Contrary to what you may have been told or may have read, it's not an anti-war song, nor is the album one of protest against war. So do not judge this album based on the one song. Also don't judge it until you've given it at least three listenings. There are some real sweet gems in this collection of introspective and personal songs for Madonna. There is the bouncy and really fun song \\"Hollywood\\". Next there is the moving \\"Nothing Fails\\" complete with gospel choir backup that can't help but remind you of the great Like A Prayer. Then of course there is \\"Die Another Day\\" an awesome song in it's own right and strangely it does fit with this collection. The album concludes with the awesome \\"Easy Ride\\". Give this album a shot. Give this album a shot. Give this album a shot. I figure if I type that 3 times, people will listen.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Jack and Meg are back with the same formula:  Robert Plant-esque raspy voice, excellent guitar riffs, crashing drums, and memorable lyrics.  The formula has worked in four albums now, so why should it change.  Hopefully it never does.  In addition to the talent of The White Stripes, Jack and Meg throw in a little humor to the mix this time around.  Also, they are beginning more and more to experiment with interesting sounds and styles, while always sticking to the formula that they work so perfectly.<br />The songs on 'Elephant' are excellent.  From the shoe-tapping &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; to the ecclectic &quot;It's True that we Love One Another&quot; to Meg's first (and whimsical) vocals in &quot;In the Cold, Cold Night&quot;.<br />Some critics knock this album by saying &quot;all the songs sound the same&quot; or &quot;the recording sounds bad&quot; or &quot;Meg is an awful drummer&quot;.  Well, in retort, The White Stripes sound so unlike any other band right now because the record their music on reel-to-reel, instead of using computers.  As an alternative to knocking the album, everyone should be applauding the artistic creativeness of this band and their unorthodox style and recording processes.  The White Stripes are the perfect escape vehicle for the over-done and awful rap/rock hybrid music that tops the charts now-a-days.  Rock needs to get back to the basics:  lyrics, sound, and style.  This is exactly where The White Stripes are taking us.
B00004WGAI|5.0|Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clark are to Jane Eyre, what Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehele are to Pride and Prejudice<BR>What higher praise can be given.<BR>Hope that they will put it out in DVD<BR>There is a great chemistry between Dalton and Clark........<BR>This is the definitive Jane Eyre........Bought 3 copies.and it was woth the money.
B000001I0Q|5.0|It's an album I have never stopped listening to since I first bought it. It is darkly poetic, it is scathing, it is angry, it is imaginative. This is an example of the brilliance that can erupt when a band is all on the same page. There is not a throw away track on the cd. No, these are not ALL brilliant songs, but you will not find yourself routinely hitting the fast forward button on your remote. The standouts on here I contend are not just standouts on the disc, but standouts in alternative/punk/goth...whatever it is you want to lable this band that did not want to be labled. \\"OPEN YOUR EYES\\"...Jesus...this song is 20 years old and it is just as meaningful today as it was when Reagan was in office. It will depress you at just how little things change. The word plays show that Bators (or Bator depending on how the stars were alligned) was not some punk dope, but a very clever musician. \\"HOLY WAR\\"...the Catholic Boy gives it to the Pope but good. <BR>THe musicianship is outstanding. Great guitar riffs, basslines, throbbing drumb beats. The atmosphere is often dark and clammy. The Lords pull off one of the only song covers in music that surpasses an original...their version of QUESTION OF TEMPERATURE  kicks Balloon Farm's ...!<BR>Yes friends, this is one of the few albums out there worth PAYING for.
0802130208|3.0|Filled with satirical black humor concerning the usually overlooked \\"characters\\" of society, John Kennedy Toole's Pulitzer prize winning novel The Confederacy of Dunces , captures a reality of our society that we like to disregard.  <BR> In The Confederacy of Dunces  the unique tempo and the slow pace of the overall development of the plot creates a feel of dreary, everyday life, while the immediate happenings tend to be absurd, ridiculous, or down right stupid.  In many instances Toole will jump between a third person point of view subjective to different characters, or a objective point of view depicting the seen from many angles making the absurdity of the happenings or the actions and words of our hero Ignatius J. Riely painfully clear.  Then the long tedious exchanges of letters between Myna Minkoff and Ignatius, or the journals of Ignatius, though still absurd, draws out the story and creates a weary response from the reader.  Energetic, dreary, energetic, dreary.... The delicate mixture of excitement and dullness creates a parallel with life, a disturbing realization due to the fact that readers tend to think the actions of the characters in this novel \\"not normal\\".<BR> There are many \\"characters\\" in this novel, to tell the truth all most all characters that appear in this novel are not what people would like to call \\"normal\\".  Still, none can beat Ignatius J. Riely in uniqueness.  \\"Huge, obese, fractious, fastidious, a latter-day Gargantuan, a Don Quixote of the French Quarter\\" (Henry Kisor, Chicago Sun-Times), how did this complete slob of a man ever make it to the cover of a best seller?  Through out the book he undergoes no mental growth (he does gain some pounds though), and his only reason for even considering moving is threats!  What is the point of putting such a complete \\"character\\" in the main role?  When this combined with the earlier idea of the book paralleling with life, one sees that Toole is saying that these people, this society, maybe not inthis extent, but still does actually exist.<BR> The Confederacy of Dunces  captures vividly the society of \\"queers\\", \\"nerds\\", \\"social-outcasts\\", and the \\"sub-normal\\".  Then through the book he shows the readers the desperate reality that this is not \\"sub-normal\\".  It is a depressing realization, but an important one.  Knowing of a failure is the best way to start fixing what ever it is that is failing.  If you feel in any way revolted by anything in this novel, understand that it is real, then think of how you can change things for the better.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|From the first hard hitting drum beat of &quot;Straight Out of Line&quot; you know without a doubt it's Godsmack. Unlike a lot of bands that have been out for a while, Godsmack's sound hasn't changed. Instead of attempting to follow whatever direction metal music is going at the time, Godsmack is staying true to their own unique sound and lyrics that has gotten them where they are today. From the awesome hard hitting tracks of &quot;Faceless,&quot; &quot;Make Me Believe,&quot; and &quot;Releasing the Demons,&quot; to name a few, to the more melodic &quot;Serenity,&quot; true Godsmack fans will be pleased to hear their boys haven't changed a bit over the last few years.
0385504209|3.0|I read \\"Angels and Demons\\" first, and it has a plot hole you can drive truck through - at least this book is better. For some reason this book has a \\"buzz\\" about it - I think some folks think this is based on facts. If you read it as light fiction, it is OK. Anyone paying much attention will easily figure out who \\"teacher\\" is LONG before the characters in the book.<br />Get it from the library or wait for the paperback.<br />Dennis
B00008RH3L|5.0|I can't express how excited I am that this movie is finally being released on DVD.  Forget about it being one of the best gangster films ever.  This is one of the best movies ever.  If you like movies, you'll like this movie.  Okay, maybe that's a bit of an overstatement, but I'd suggest giving it a try. Some may say it moves slow.  Some may say it's confusing.  But I'm sure if you're conscious, you can figure it out and enjoy it.  I will say that listening closely to dialogue may have never been as important in a movie as in this one.  You'll catch a lot if you really pay attention.  If you're not in the mood for a movie that makes you use your brain, then watch this on another night.  Just watch it, because it's great.
B000089RV6|2.0|This is typical from Epic, the same record company that permitted Ozzy to re-record BLIZZARD OF OZZ and DIARY OF A MADMAN replacing the bass player and the drummer, and not even informing it the CD box...<br />Now, we have the AC/DC catalog released again. They promised the public marvellous things. But you'll find none here.<br />The graphic content is really impressive, top quality. There's also some worth texts. But, lyrics? Forget about them. There are none in the entire series, even in records that, in their first CD print, contained them (Example: DIRTY DEEDS DONE DIRT CHEAP). As for the bonus track connecting to the internet, they are joke: in BACK IN BLACK, there is none bonus track, just an interview with Brian Johnson.<br />BACK IN BLACK, the music, is FIVE STARS. BACK IN BLACK, this package here, is just lust for money.

The out takes is also very hilarous..<br />if you want a intelligent thoughtful movie this movie isn't for you..but if you wanna watch a movie that will make you laugh out loud. this is absolutley the movie for you.
B00008H2LB|2.0|First things first. I bought Hybrid Theory within days of its release and it was definitely one of the best albums of that year...<br />In 2003, Linkin Park returns with almost the same sound as before, and all it proves just how short the shelf-life was for nu-metal. Meteora must describe their projected sales, because the musical evolution expected from this release just isn't there. Chester sounds like the warbling geek he really is - his radio-hugging version of \\"angst\\" had me rolling on the floor. Mike Shinoda continues to rap by the numbers and although the \\"album\\" comes in at a meaty 30-something minutes, it seems to drag on.<br />If you want to hear rap, listen to any of the millions of \\"artists\\" flooding every damn radio station and music tv channel. If you want artsy-fartsy metal with a soul, listen to Tool. Linkin Park, like every other outfit that straddles multiple genres, manages to sell huge volumes because many of us simply love huge doses of comfortable mediocrity.<br />Consider albums like these appetizers - if this is the best thing you've ever heard, then you haven't heard much.<br />* This rant clocked in at 190 words. Thank you for calling *
B0000024ZT|4.0|Bruce's debut is a big winner. Don't miss it. The ballads drag, but five tunes - Blinded By the Light, Growin' Up, For You, Spirit in the Night, and Hard to Be a Saint In the City - rank among his greatest efforts. Indeed, &quot;Saint&quot; may be my all-time favorite Springsteen cut. I've never heard another song by anyone that even vaguely resembles it. <br />Bruce went on to make more polished recordings such as Born To Run and Born in the USA, and his album immediately after this - The Wild, the Innocent and the E-Street Shuffle - represents a major step forward lyrically from what sometimes is too much wordiness here. But take it from someone who's loved Bruce since the 1970's - this is one heck of a debut and it belongs in your collection.
B00000G3PA|1.0|I don't know why I'm even writing a review on this movie right now, but this is one of the dumbest movies ever made.<br />Once a guy tried to tell me how realistic it was.  I couldn't stop laughing.
0375758992|5.0|That's what it is. It doesn't \\"conflate a particular white settler Rhodesian childhood with African somehow,\\" ...and there is no \\"vapid attempt at shock value by constantly mentioning the word pee,\\"...<br />The problem with a democratic review system is that it's democratic. <br />This is vivid storytelling, emotionally honest and detailed. It's a history of a certain period only incidentally; it's what happened to this person, in this family, in this place, at this time... Take it for what it is-- a great, strange, and vivid memoir.
B00004HYLF|5.0|I love this album, pure electronic fusion. A bit different from other Return To Forever albs. Al Di Meola did a great job, only Flora is missing, but electronic instrumental music of this quality sounds great. If anything I'm missing is more people of my age (22) listening to this style.
B000058T5E|1.0|Unbelievable - that's all I can say.  Logging in a massive 36 minutes (YES less than 1/2 of a full CD - maybe it should sell for only [half the price]), once you take away the 1 minute drum loop intros with dull, repetitive bass lines, this CD probably has bout 20 minutes of real guitar playing on it.  I recently bought the boxed set of \\"Blow by Blow\\", \\"Wired\\" and \\"There and Back\\" and can't believe it is even the same guitarist.  <br />It's time to quit using words like \\"Genius\\" & \\"Guitar God\\" for people who put out this type of an offering.  Any of Eric Johnson's albums blow this one right out of the galaxy.  If you're looking for a stunning guitar playing, spend your money on the new Frank Gambale, Joe Satriani or Eric Johnson CD.  If you want to see what happens when a legend tries to stoop to the lowest common denominator of current pop trends, and sacrifice his guitar playing to do so, buy this CD and enjoy your 36 minutes of music.
6304913176|5.0|This is a VERY sneaky movie.  Voerhoven gives us what seems to be a mindless bowl of violent action movie pablum but secretly it is a sharp criticism of militaristic societies.  On the surface you see good looking and rather dumb young people happily marching off to war to \\"defend\\" the earth.  Its fun to watch and offers an idealistic view of what the typical empty-headed teenager thinks is life.<BR>The true reality for the intellectual-minded is a depiction of a completely fascist society that is far from idyllic.  There is little in terms of Orwellian-style oppression of the individual but there is a cradle-to-grave mass propaganda given to all.<BR>Millions of humans die as a result of the Federal Network's military ambitions in the Milky Way Galaxy.  As the movie briefly points out....Klendathu is on the OTHER SIDE OF THE MILKY WAY!  Hardly a problem unless humans are trying to dominate the entire galaxy.  Is that really necessary?  Who cares, as Doogie Howser said \\"We're in it for the species\\".  They finally ran into an enemy they can't dominate and suddenly humanity is truly threatened due to inherent human arrogance.<BR>Politics aside, the movie is obscenely violent....the brief nudity is actually nothing compared to the orgasmic camaera views of the impalements, decapitations, and general nastiness the mobile infantry suffers.<BR>The biggest crime is that Denise Richards does NOT take off her shirt....darn.<BR>When I first watched this movie I thought it was stupid beyond belief, but after a few more watchings I realized what the movie really was and can congratulate the director for his subtlety in dealing with the subject of uncontrolled nationalism and imperialistic politics.  The Nazi-style uniforms were an excellent touch and underscored how easy it is to fall back into an undemocratic society where the military ends up ruling the roost.<BR>Most people won't \\"get\\" the movie, but for the few that do....its a quiet little joke that you can secretly laugh about.

(Though the reader's \\"French\\" accent turned off a couple of friends.)<br />This book is terrific, and who reads mysteries for the grammar anyway??
0312305060|4.0|I found &quot;the hours&quot; to be an intricate and captivating story of three women and just everyday life.  I found that cunningham did a wonderful job of writing women from a males perspective.  It's amazing how each of the women have a small yet present echo in each others lives.  As you read you see many parallels between their stories.  You begin to see the strength and yet a resounding weakness that each women pocess.  Cunningham is able to have three completely different lives but one soul between the women.  I found that this book is great for anyone to read and being only 16 I had no struggle with the book only understanding.
B00008S2VG|4.0|I bought this album on the day of its release. I'm not a Madonna fan,  but I must admit her work is at its best. I have her prevoius work: MUSIC, and this album its completely at its level. It has some amazing slow songs accompained by the guitar such as EASY RIDE, X-STATIC PROCESS, NOTHING FAILS (this one is great, and she uses her Gospel Choir once more). I'm so glad Madonna hasn't gone into this Rappers thing as Mariah Carey did... and thats the reason why this album was number one. Go Madonna because your albums will always be great!
B000000W3G|5.0|i don't understand how this perfect box set was passed off as b-sides while mellon collie had several poor tracks (ex. we only come out at night..). if the pumpkins had these songs at their disposal at the time mellon collie was put together, whoever chose what to cut did a terrible job. TAFH is nothing short of amazing. if offers a much more dynamic view of what the pumpkins were writing during the mellon collie era than the mellon collie album itself does. the five discs are all completely different from one another and james acually gets to sing here more often, which sounds great.<br />bullet with butterfly wings - this is probably my least favorite, but it's still good. mostly covers, the new-wave-ish ones aren't that great. ironically, \\"said sadly...\\" and \\"a night like this\\", the two james iha songs are the best on the single. overall, this one is the biggest mishmosh in the set. not necessarily a bad thing, but i think this one goes a little off the deep end.<br />1979 - i really like this one a lot. all the songs are practically mezmorizing. i get \\"ugly\\" and \\"cherry\\" stuck in my head for days on end. james has two songs here also. not his best, but they really help pull this single together. \\"set the ray to jerry\\" sounds like a throwback to the siamese dream era. i don't understand what possessed them to discard it in the first place.<br />zero - this is the heaviest disc in the set. \\"mouths of babes\\" might be my favorite song out of all five discs. i can't decide, they're all so good. \\"pennies\\" is way to soft to be here and seems vastly out of place, but is still excellent. \\"god\\", \\"tribute to johnny\\", and \\"marquis in spades\\" flesh out the disc's pounding theme. surprisingly, i don't find \\"pistachio medely\\" to be as pointless as many other reviewers do. i think it's interesting. let's just leave it at that. except for the last 5 minutes or so, which really get on your nerves with that same chord over and over.<br />tonight, tonight - this is possibly my favorite. aside from the title track it's all accustic with a drum machine here and there. \\"medilla of the grey skies\\" is amazing. i can't even describe it. actually, this whole disc is amazing. i really like the accustic version of tonight, tonight. it does more justice to the song than the overproduced version.<br />thirty three - this one is definitly the weirdest of the five. i guess everyone wouldn't like this disc, but then again, if you're crazy enough to be looking into a pumpkins box set you just might. it's basically a collection of art damaged alt rock songs. none really stand out that much to me except maybe \\"last song\\" and \\"the aeroplane flies high\\". also, \\"my blue heaven\\" is a cover with just billy and piano, but it's a great way to end the set.<br />overall i would only recommend this to fans. it's not for anyone looking to buy their first pumpkin record. but it is truly something beautiful. i can't give it enough praise. unfortunatly, commercially it's been completely overshadowed by mellon collie, which pales miserably compared to TAFH box set, and that's saying a lot because that album is a masterpiece in it's own right. also, for people who were upset with the path the pumpkins took after siamese dream, this set is more reminiscent of their early days than mellon collie.
0553573403|2.0|I want to like this book. I really do. The writing style is excellent, the descriptions are evocative, etc. I can tell that Martin has truly masterful control over his craft, language. And admittedly, I'm not quite a hundred pages into it, so there's a long way to go. But one of the things that draws me into a book is strong, active female characters, and so far (and admittedly I'm not very far into it) I just ain't seeing any. <BR>So far, the female characters I've met at length include Catelyn Stark (passive, jealous wife), Daenerys (passive, whimpering sexual victim--the scene where her brother asserted that he would prostitute her to the entire khalasar if that was the only way to regain his army made me just about throw the book across the room) and Arya (spoiled brat). Now just because this book is set in a sexist society doesn't bother me; what bothers me is that the women in the book are all only reactive, passive, or victimized (check out Michelle West's Serra Teresa and Diora for examples of strong female characters operating within the confines of a profoundly sexist society). Maybe it gets better. I hope it does. I know I'm not very far into it at all and I should give it more of a chance, but right now I'm really close to giving up on it. I don't want to, because I can tell that this is a good, well-written book, and it is very, very possible that he is going somewhere with these characters, but unless things improve and fast I don't know if I'll have the patience to find out.
0316666343|4.0|A moving novel about a young girl, Susie, who was raped and murdered as a young girl.  As she is in heaven she looks down and watches the people she loves, but also her murderer.  <br />Alice Sebold was born in 1963.  She is married to a writer.  Alice studied at Syracuse University and graduated from the University of Houston and the University of California.  \\"The Lovely Bones\\" is her second novel that she has written.  The first one is a memior titled \\"Lucky.\\"<br />I personally enjoyed \\"The Lovely Bones\\" because of the main character Susie.  She has a great personality and so much spunk, I loved how you got to hear how her life continued. I also really enjoyed the fact that Susie was in heaven and told her story from there. I thought that it was a very interesting way to show how her life continued.  It was a very original and unique way that made the book even more interesting.  I would reccomend this book to anyone that would like a good novel to read and a good story to fall in love with.
B000002H97|3.0|Metallica´s self titled fifth album turned them into one of the biggest rock bands in history and the LP wen´t on to sell over 22 million copies worldwide. Many people complain those who were Metallica fans before that this album is no where near as good as its predecessor. In a way this is partly true. <br />I Have nothing against a bad that is chaning and want´s to envolve however they have to do it right and by that I mean artistically not commercially. This Album starts off well but lacks in some aspects. The production is fabolous however are Metallica the right band to have this kind of sound and being motivated. No. The fact is that their newer stuff is awful. Not because they are doing music with better production its because they are doing it all wrong. The music stinks and it does not match James Hetfield voice. This album has some classic tracks on it and the production like I said is good however I think Bob Rock spend way to much time on the boys because in the end this album sounds a bit boring. The album contains filler and could easily have skipped few songs even though it contains just 12 tracks. <br />Overall grade 6/10.
6305609705|5.0|Simply a masterpiece and Francis Ford Coppola's best film in my opinion.There are so many ways to view this and take something new everytime.The use of surrealism is especially strong near the end of it.This is not much a war movie however,like Full Metal Jacket but an experience of war attained.Watch with an open mind.

B00008WT5C|4.0|Out of the 8 songs that are on LET THERE BE ROCK the only 2 songs that are not bonafide hits are DOG EAT DOG, and OVERDOSE. The other 6, they are must listen. We have the classic title track, which showcases Angus playing as well as drumming of Phil Rudd. The other instant classic song WHOLE LOTTA ROSIE tells the story of Bon Scott's adventures which a women who had it all like the song says. This whole album is built around the guitar playing of Angus, and the lyrics and vocals of Bon Scott, which is something the group lost after his passing.I would have liked to see CRASPODY IN BLUE also added to this reissue, its a song that I've never even heard but it would have still been a nice addition since it was never released here. Oh well, we still have a great album here and if you like you hard rock down and dirty, then this is the album for you to add to your collection.

B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix - a Warner Brothers release, written and directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski<br />_The Matrix_ breaks new ground in the sci-fi/action film genre.  Not only does it feature revolutionary special effects, but it has a complex storyline to boot.  In _The Matrix_, Neo (Keanu Reeves) is a hacker recruited by a team of rebels, led by Morpheus (Laurence Fishbourne), whom law enforement agents regard as the &quot;most dangerous man on the planet.&quot;  Neo joins Morpheus and his crew, where he is showed the world as it truly is - the haunting reality that humans have been overtaken by a race of machines, and, worse still, are being used simply as an energy source for these machines.  The purpose of Morpheus and his crew is to disrupt our imaginary &quot;dream world&quot; that the machines have created to keep us happy (the Matrix), and free our minds.<br />The special effects in _The Matrix_ are absolutely stunning.  The Wachowski Brothers and their crew have developed what they like to call &quot;bullet time.&quot; This &quot;bullet time&quot; is composed of hundreds of still shots of a target, that when put together render ultra-realistic super-slow motion.<br />There are many similarities between Neo's transformation over the course of the film, and the life of Christ.  Some of these things seem, at first glance, trite or inconsequential, but upon further investigation, unravel deeper meaning.  An example of this is Neo's real name, Thomas Anderson.  Anderson, when translated, means &quot;son of man.&quot; Neo also means &quot;new&quot; - Neo Anderson, &quot;the new son of man.&quot;  Is Neo like a new Messiah?<br />In one portion of the film, Morphues takes Neo to see the Oracle, an old woman who happens to know everything.  She predicts a Second Coming of sorts, and tells Neo to &quot;find his path.&quot;  Morpheus is absolutely convinced that Neo is &quot;the One,&quot; the saviour for mankind (much like Christ).  In another portion of the film, Neo is, for a moment, dead.  He is then brough back to like (resurrected), where he shortly thereafter, and very symbolically, ascends to the heavens.<br />_The Matrix_ will stand as a benchmark in special effects and storytelling for years to come.or a moment, dead.

B00005JLKN|2.0|First of all, shame on these guys for tricking us on the DVD. You push &quot;Play Movie&quot; on the menu, and instead of playing the movie as promised, they make you watch a preview for The Incredible Hulk. Extremely annoying.<br />The only worthwhile moments in the film are with Anthony Hopkins, but he is not central to the film. The problem is that the tortured (and torturing) serial killer, played by Ralph Fiennes, is just plain weird. Not interesting, not compelling, and above all, not believeable. <br />There are some unintentionally funny scenes where he talks to his mom that could have been lifted straight out of Psycho. Except at least Psycho knew that it was a campy exercise in style, whereas this movie takes itself way too seriously.
B00008DDSC|5.0|The title misled me into expecting a cheesy pseudo-comedy about the tired subject of female exploitation in work places. Then, a bit of reading pointed towards a plot based on maverick overtones of S&M (disclaimer: not really my bag), which had me expecting a psychosexual serving of \\"Working Girl\\" (that Griffith humdinger from the 80s) with bondage thrown in for good measure.<br />Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised to be proved mostly wrong on both accounts.<br />As for the hackeneyed theme of female exploitation, the protagonist's initial willingness to acquiesce to her boss' punitive ministerings could have easily made her a victim of an employer/a man/a senior. Instead, this is quite convincingly shown to be her mode of entry into adulthood, allowing her to develop the inner resources to be a self-determined woman relentless in the pursuit of what and whom she wants.<br />As for bondage, the depictions are not really bad at all (albeit occasionally guilty of needless nudity, imho) and in fact for better or for worse challenge our pre-conceived notions of sex. Anyone involved in a relationship knows that an essential ingredient is variable power balance -- it's inevitable, despite some people's claims that they have a completely equal affiliation. These power shifts help keep romance vibrant, most likely resulting in wisdom and self-acceptance. What men often confuse as strength -- stoicism, aloofness, obstinacy -- are, more often than not actually weaknesses leading to ignorance, avoidance and ultimate demise. Paradoxically, it's in hapless vulnerability that we actually discover what we're capable of, being able to develop emotional resilience and learning to express desire, sexual or otherwise. Gylenhaal's Lee Holloway embodies this weakness-as-power concept to the T, making an appealing case for growth by any means necessary.<br />In a nutshell, a delicious, fast-paced, wonderfully filmed, off-beat romantic \\"comedy\\". Not something I'd necessarily go out on a limb to buy or own, but definitely worth an enjoyable evening's rental. Twice.a limb to buy or own, but definitely worth an enjoyable evening's rental. Twice.

0688163173|5.0|Let me say this right up front: Dennis Lehane is one of my favorite authors! I have read all of his books, and uniformly enjoyed every one of them. This latest work is no exception, even though it takes him in a far different direction than his previous works. This is a moody, atmospheric thriller, which leaves the reader guessing all the way through it, and then ends with the reader gasping in shock and surprise at the ending. I don't even want to go into the plot at all, for fear that I might inadvertently leave some tip as to what is happening in the book. All that I can say is that, if you enjoy good writing, with an extremely complicated and, at times, confusing (but never untrue to the storyline) plot, with characters you will grow to identify with, you should read this book. I guarantee that you will not be disappointed.
B000089A07|1.0|Now I like a few I imagine first was familar with the novel than with either film adaptation made of it. The first was Manhunter which was directed by Michael Mann back in 1986. Although that film seems to stray quite far from the novel it is in fact a much more fateful adaptation to the book as this bad remake. In the novel Will Graham was the key character and the suspense layed in whether or not his mind can handle doing the job that not only nearly drove him insane but also nearly killed him when he captured Lector. In the novel Lector was NOT a major factor in capturing anyone. In this remake they sort of tried making another Silence of the Lambs instead of making a version truer to the novel.<br />A major flaw in this is what they did to the character of Will Graham. He is remade into being a character although a veteran in detective work no smarter than Starling in Silence of the lambs who was a mere FBI trainee. His superior Jack Crawford (played by Kietel who seems to play every character the same way) actually tries to get Graham to not only come out of retirement but to ask Lector who nearly kills him for help??? Does that make sense???? In the novel the only reason Graham went to Lector in the first place was because he was a suspect and not a sorce of helpful information. They totally alter this fact in this remake.<br />To confuse the matter even more. They had the killer on the loose character Francis Dollarhyde be as close to the book as possible even though EVERYTHING else is completely altered. Ralph Finnes did a terrific job in this film taking on a role totally different from anything else he had ever attempted. His performance will change the way one looks at his work in other roles forever and it warrants the only star I can think to give this film.<br />If one has read the novel or has seen this film I recommend seeing Manhunter which was actually the first film in the series that was made. It stayts truer to the novel because Will Graham who was the real star in the novel and the film figured out the case on his own. His visit to Lector was not advised or requested by anyone but his own decision to recover the mindset of a killer. In the remake does Crawford really ask him to see him after entering the mind of this killer drove him to the insane aslyum??? Nice work Hollywood. You made Hopkins a prominant part by ruining the story.was the real star in the novel and the film figured out the case on his own.

0393057658|5.0|It's amazing that with all the complaints by Selig &amp; Co. of how poorer baseball teams cannot comepete, Beane and the A's have built an organization primed for long term success.<br />As a baseball fan, this book is a great read.  It crystalizes what specific factors weigh in to Oakland's player evaluation metrics, and how they leverage inefficiencies in the market to their advantage.<br />One of the greatest tragedies in baseball is the failure rate of young players.  For so long, we've assumed that it's because hitting a round ball with a round bat &quot;square&quot; is so difficult.  However, as Beane and the A's have proved, teams are looking for the wrong skills!<br />Beane has assembled a roster of players that other teams have passed on and cast off, and with it, taken the mighty Yankees to the brink twice in the past 3 years.  What's most remarkable is that this isn't an &quot;abberation,&quot; but a system of player development that should keep the A's in competition until the rest of the league catches up.<br />Lewis doesn't get into the actual &quot;meat&quot; of the statistical methods used, but this is a great start for any fan of the game.  Especially if your team has been in a state of never-ending &quot;rebuilding.&quot;
B00008PW3O|5.0|&quot;Say You Will&quot; is such an incredible breath of fresh air from all the formula Pop/Rock of the last five years. It is filled with intricate melodies, unbelievable guitar work, and the lyrics that can only be written by those who have lived a full life with great highs and lows. Stevie Nick's lyrics are always best when partnered with Lindsay Buckingham's sense of timing and backed with his unique guitar talent. A stand out for Stevie fans is the haunting &quot;Goodbye Baby.&quot; Equally passionate is &quot;Running Through the Garden.&quot; Buckingham's best are more synical (of course) with &quot;Come&quot; topping the list for me and &quot;Miranda&quot; in a close second. For the layman's ear it takes a few listens but it is far and above anything released this year. I will be shocked if &quot;Say You Will&quot; doesn't win many, many Grammy's.

This novel exposes the hurried, sometimes hectic and crazy world, of the working mother and wife.<br />Kate Reddy is a wife, mother of two small children, and a world-traveling fund manager, but not necessarily in that order.  While she has the bull by the horns at work, her family life is starting to unravel.  Kate questions where her loyalty should lie?  Should she feel less of a woman because she does not belong to the \\"muffia\\" stay-at-home moms?  This novel explores the options, or lack thereof, of having a demanding career and being a good wife and mother in the process.  This book also exposes the real difference in how the world views working mothers vs. working fathers.  Kate realizes this view of the world around her,  \\"If a man has pictures of kids on his desk, it enhances his humanity; if a woman has them it decreases hers. Why? Because he's not supposed to be home with the children; she is.\\"<br />As I said in my opening, although this book is fictional, I believe it is truly an excellent look into reality.
B000089RVX|2.0|First off I'd like to inform all the radio-friendly listeners that this is not original...if you knew anything about metal then you would know that great bands like Lacuna Coil and Nightwish were doing this way before Evanscene...but for the mainstream they are head and shoulders above the rest.<br />The music is okay, nothing special though. The female vocals take centre stage with some great vocal talent. But then there is the nu-metal vocalist...omg how much does he sound like other bands like Finch and Hell is for Heros, an obvious strategy to sell more records. And the music is fairly average.<br />Conclusion:<BR>The female vocalist deserves five stars the male vocalists deserve one and the band deserves 2.5 stars. Contains lots of catchy hooks for the radio friendly audience to sell by the millions.<BR>If you are a true fan of metal and music as a whole do your self a favour and pick up a Nightwish, Lacuna Coil, Opeth, or Pain Of Salvation album, and get some value for money.
0451457994|5.0|this book kicks... the beginning is awesome and richly detailed.It is the greatest sci-fi ever. read it and find its goodness for yourself
B000066NW0|1.0|What the...?<br />Okay I respect the people who actually wrote the songs (good catchy songs) and the SESSION players HIRED in have the talent to play the instruments.<br />But what I destest, and makes me want to vomit is the fact that Avril says she is punk, she is so obviously pop. She can't sing live, and at MTV Icon Metallica she looked like she didn't even know who Metallica was...she discovered the Sex Pistols a few months ago, and she has got big budget videos on MTV...that IS NOT PUNK...peel off her stupid punk image and hey yet another Britney Spears clone:-)<br />The only thing that is selling her records his her attitude towards pop, her image (which is mediocre), and her catchy songs (which she doesn't write anyway).<br />If you buy this album and like it thats fine with me, but just don't call yourself a fan of punk rock, or rock in general. IMO it is just a pathetic marketing tool that is a complete waste of money, and Avrils just laughing all the way to the bank...and she doesn't have any talent. In a years time she will be forgotten and Avril will be spending the rest of her life a very rich lady.
B000068FY1|1.0|A CD full of forgettable and mediocre songs, with no possible need to listen more than twice, the second listening to be sure you've heard the reasons you were disappointed. This isn't progressive country i.e. Gram Parsons, etc., this is self congratulatory bubblegum.
B000002UKS|2.0|After the grunge scene died down, some bands decided to ride the cotails of previous great acts and deliver a watered down version of music that used to have some passion and emotion going into it. The Foo Fighters can be catergorised as &quot;grunge-lite&quot; - harmless almost dancible tunes that will not offend anyone and are sure to be played in every radio station around.<br />When listening to this, I cannot say that it is a terrible album. The band does know how to write some catchy music - &quot;Everlong&quot;, but these songs are too harsh to be pop, to weak to be considered rock and they lack the bitterness of grunge. I am reminded a lot of Silverchair's 1st three albums as they are very similar to this - neither of those making any impression on me at all.<br />In the end like many bands this music falls into the &quot;cute&quot; category - read: background music.
B000089RVX|5.0|An Amazing mixture of haunting vocals, ethreal music, and positive messages! This band has an amazing, one-of-a-kind sound! I listen to this CD on a daily basis. If you don't believe me, go download some of their previous works from the album, &quot;Origin&quot; (The band has given their blessing to downloading this album since it is no longer available for purchase.) Though I am a little uneasy about their public image of 'Christians-but-pretty worldly', their music has been a true blessing in my life. This is a purchase that you will not regret.
B000005RT8|4.0|Macca had to have been out of his mind wacka on herbal jazz cigarettes when he cut this album. On The Way sounds like a left-over from the eponymous McCartney record. Waterfall is a typical Paul perfect ballad. After that, LOOK OUT!!! Temporary Secretary and Secret Friend are Macca inventing acid house 16 years before it happened. There are a few bum tracks (Bogey Music, anyone?) that stinkup the album, but this is essential for anyone interested in McCartney and/or cutting edge music.
B00000JMP9|3.0|\\"Goethe's tale of deepest passion...... a forbidden love.\\", written on the DVD cover, this line sums up accurately what Massanet's opera Werther pertains to, but, not a really true statement for this filmed version - \\"a forbidden love story\\", it is, \\"a tale of deepest passion\\", it may not.  <br />There are excellent examples of filmed opera that actually works, but this Werther has somewhat lost its focus, when the director was, seemingly, wavering between film and opera, trying to give full play of both. In its elaborate sceneries and camera work, the deep passion and brooding effect, which is what really matters in this opera, flags. Overall it flows slowly or even stagnantly at times, with maybe a few scenes stand out with the power of drama and wonderful singing. Peter Dvorsky sings a very good Werther, whose lovesickness and melancholy is well rendered, although a bit stiff in his acting. Brigitte Fassbaender sings and acts a convincing Charlotte. The scene of \\"Pourquoi me réveiller?\\", which is one of the few affecting scenes, showcased the two leading roles' magnificent singing. <br />Had this film been focused more on its opera essence, it would fully merit the praise.
0380977788|5.0|Everybody wants to read CORALINE. And why do they? Because the story is absolutely wonderful. CORALINE has a magical and whimsical quality that makes it absolutely scrumptious. I love the way that I was able to pick up this book, be finished reading it in an hour, and feel absolutely satisfied afterwards. Although this is a book written with children in mind, it is quite enjoyable for adults. I think that the allure of children's books is that they take you to a world outside of the hum-drum of everyday life. While CORALINE is a little on the scarey and weird side, it definitely does take you to a strange world behind a curious door in Coraline's new house. At first, everything behind the door seems to be a mirror of the life on the other side of the door. However, there are just a few changes that tempt her to stay in the other world rather than in her own. For example, in the other world, her other mother can actually cook a decent meal. Her other room is painted beautiful colors and her other toys seem to be alive. Of course, it was too good to be true and Coraline's escape from the other world of button-eyed people takes quite a bit of courage.<br />Neil Gaiman is a master storyteller. He has written a story in our own time that is destined to be a classic for years to come. Luckily, he writes books for adults as well. This is the type of book that I absolutely must hold on to so that I can read it to my children oneday (when I finally every do have children).
B000002VMH|5.0|After a lengthy collaboration with Dave Stewart as the Eurythmics, Annie Lennox breaks free with a solo album in 1992, simply titled Diva. And gladly, this has certainly been one of the best LPs of all time, sealing Lennox's reputation as a certified songwriter and performer.<br />Beginning with the haunting opener, Why, Lennox sings of broken love with deep yearning and anguish. Walking On Broken Glass and Cold further prove that when it comes to love, no one sings it better than Lennox. While the mood on this album is generally sombre, Lennox lifts the spirits on Little Bird, a nice little dance single about breaking free.<br />The strength of this album lies in Lennox's storng songwriting, emotive lyrics, and excellent vocal delivery. Each note is sung with the precise dose of emotions and it goes to show that no octave-scaling vocals are needed to make mountains move. Watch out for the Grammy-winning long-play video collection of the same title. It's the perfect visual companion to this solid album, save for the exclusion of the wonderful Little Bird video which was really a shame.
B00007AJF9|5.0|This movie is one of the closest recounts to the actual life of Elizabeth I. I have watched this movie many times and am delighted everytime I watch it. There are some discrepencies in the relationships that Elizabeth had during her early years as Queen of England, but overall it is truly a delight to watch. The star stacked cast as well as Cate Blanchett's wonderful portrayal of Elizabeth I make this movie a must see for any fanatic of the Enlgish Royals! If you enjoyed this movie you must see A &amp; E's recount of Queen Victoria's life with Prince Albert in Victoria &amp; Albert.
0880793589|5.0|I have had these cards for about 8 years now and they have never failed to help me or my team out of a bind. Anytime you are at a loss for an idea, need a solution for a problem or just plain brainstorming, pull these out. At first your colleagues will look at you as though you have 3 heads (cards???), but they will soon come to realize that your end results would not have been nearly as productive or successful without them. <BR>Nearly everyone in my office has a deck now!!!
B00005JKPF|5.0|First I have to say this movie is 10 times better than the first.  It is a darker more violent movie(definately heed the PG-13 rating).  The movie opens with an attepmted assination of the President and ends with the death of an X-Man(if you've read the X-Men comics you know where that is actually leading, but for those thathave never read the comic, I don't want to spoil the surprise of the next sequal).<br />Nightcrawler(a new mutant to the movie storyline) is outstanding.  Wolverine is the way he's suppose to be, a lean, mean, hacking machine.  And Magneto's prison escape is just awesome.<br />For die-hard X-Men fans look for the various referances to the X-Men that haven't made it into the film.  Like Beast(Dr. Henry McCoy) and Gambit(Remy LeBeau).<br />A great film that I'll go see again.  If you haven't seen it and you can't get to see The Matrix because it's sold out, go see X-2.
B00005JKES|1.0|Well......having anxiously run out and purchased the First Season on DVD and watching them all with my girlfriend, (Whom had never seen it before) I then waited for the second season patiently. For nothing! This was released in 2001. It is now more than half way through 2003, and still no second season. Now not only did I have to wait for the season ending finales and such when the show was really on television, apparently I am supposed to wait 4 years in between the release of the DVDS. At this rate I will be dead of old age before Coop even gets close to who killed Laura Palmer. Oh! But you can pre-order it the second season. BTW release date............unknown. Therefore the quality of the set is inconsequential. This is exactly the type of business practice we should punish companies for. Not reward them with ill earned money, since any thinking child of 10+ knows that 2001-2003 and counting for something that is never going to have a new episode and is just sitting around waiting for release is flatly absurd and dishonest. I would sell this item on Ebay to recoup some of my loss but I refuse to foist this on anyone else. That would make me the bad guy and there is definately one in this. It isn't me. Artisan insisted on this. Great job guys.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Fantastic is the word to describe this fantastic musical. Everything is perfect and nothing is out of place. Catherine Zeta Jones and Renee Zellweger are superb as the two murdering girls in prison for murder as is Richard Gere. Chicago is fantastic it is a must see , it is by far the best musical since Cabaret.
B00004X01U|1.0|Madonna is such an overhyped artist. Like Kylie Minogue, her last album is roughly as good as her last producer. 'Ray of Light' is Madonna's only great album. Here she hires a badly-chosen producer (Mirwais) and tries to create a new inyourface electronica style for her pop songs. What? Daft Punk were using the musical ideas here many years before Madonna, only much better. The tracks here sound rather pretentious and boring with no groove or soul.
B00005JKGK|3.0|I loved this book when I read it.  The movie had less appeal.  I watched it with some people who had not read the book first.  They found the plot and the characters confusing.  The movie skips quickly from mother to daughter, present to past, and from one mother/daughter set to another.  For people who didn't read the book, this can become a little confusing.  That said, I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to Amy Tan fans.
B0000844I8|3.0|Stargate is one of those fun but ultimately forgettable SF movies of which there are so many. Much like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, it's best feature is the TV series that it spawned.<br />The movie is a bad one, just not a very good one.  It has some good moments and some interesting ideas, as well as a few good action sequences.  But the characters, other than James Spader's Daniel Jackson, are flat (and even in Spader's case, as a good a job as he does here, Michael Shanks does a better one in the TV series).  Kurt Russel's Colonel O'Neil is bland and far less interesting that Richard Dean Anderson's portrayal of the same character.<br />I originally saw this movie when it was released.  I didn't watch it again until recently, after having watched many episodes of the TV series. My recommendation?  If you want a fun, light SF film, watch it.  But if you want something more enduring based on the same general ideas, watch the TV series instead.
B000002UAR|1.0|There is flat out one good song on this album - &quot;Taxman&quot;.  It is one of the worst albums ever recorded by a decent band.<br />Just buy &quot;Beatles 1&quot;.  Your record collection can be complete without the mediocre songs on Revolver.
B00004T9UF|5.0|The release of The Marshall Mathers LP must have driven a whole bunch of Eminem-haters crazy because, with this second album, Eminem proved he was here to stay.  In my opinion, this is the best of Eminem's first three albums, taking the rap and hip-hop up more than a few notches from the already lofty heights attained in The Slim Shady LP.  This artist's unique personal flair really bursts forth here, giving us beats and rhymes much more complex and musically adept than what had come before.  In addition, Eminem has by now thoroughly come into his own.  He is intentionally courting controversy, daring his critics and those who would love to have him censored or simply locked away somewhere to step outside with everything they have.  Those who will look underneath the violence and the swearing and the offensive remarks Eminem makes in his lyrics will find a deeply complex person with something important to say, a man who does, in his own special way, highlight the kind of real problems many young people face in the modern world, and the accusing fingers he points in all directions often serve to highlight the problems inherent in the individual and society itself.  And, as he is wont to say, he is the only person brave enough to say these things.<br />This album hits the floor running with Kill You, a track announcing to the world Eminem's confidence in himself and rejection of authority and criticism.  This level of comfort and confidence proves a great boon to the next track Stan, a song in which he reverses roles and plays the innocent good guy who is too late to help a deeply troubled fan.  Eminem marvels at his own stardom in Who Knew and Marshall Mathers, breaks the news to the Eminem-haters that I'm Back, and taunts them all, with a little help from RBX and Sticky Fingez, with the track Remember Me?.  The Way I Am is an important song, as Eminem clearly understands that his public persona is not the real Marshall Mathers but is rather whatever the people think he is; to his critics, he will always be a subversive criminal corrupting the youth of America, but to his fans he is something much different.  Songs like Amityville (featuring Bizarre from D-12) and ... Please II (with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit and Nate Dogg) raise the levels of violence and strong language up to a level that might not appeal to all Eminem fans, but the tracks are very well laid out.  Criminal is the perfect ending to the album, a final statement about Eminem's nature and the interpretation of what he does by the public at large.  However, the most important track on this second album, in many ways the song that made me a fan, is Kim.  This track, a prequel to the first album's Bonnie and Clyde 97, is understandably controversial, seeing as how it is basically a fantasy about Eminem murdering his wife, but in a very, very strange way it is actually a love song of sorts.  Few songs can rival it in terms of the immense power it communicates, especially toward the end when Eminem is basically shouting, letting go of all the betrayal and anger he feels inside.<br />I am not really into rap and hip-hop in general, so it is difficult for me to review albums such as this.  Beyond trying to communicate how incredible I think The Marshall Mathers LP is, the main point I would like to make is that no one should simply dismiss this music without listening to it for themselves.  Many of those who objectively give Eminem a chance will still hate the guy, but it is much better to determine your own feelings first-hand as opposed to dissing the guy simply because you've heard he is violent and dangerous or because some group has labeled him a bad influence on young people.nk he is; to his critics, he will always be a subversive criminal corrupting the youth of America, but to his fans he is something much different.

B000002UAX|2.0|The production of this album left something to be desired as the splicing in and overdubs just aren't as clean as they could be. (On &quot;Birthday&quot; for example, Paul's &quot;I would like you to dance&quot; followed the the cut off &quot;...aaance&quot; from the overdub).  Also, Paul missing the snare and hitting the rim on the backbeat into to USSR.<br />The layout and song progression just seems random, with slow songs sandwiched between rockers.<br />Finally, there's just too much on this album.  The better 15-16 songs would have been great with the remainder put on Anthology for Beatle fanatics.<br />Overall - 2 stars at best.
038572179X|5.0|In the realm of modern literature, no star seems to be shining as brilliantly as that of Ian McEwan, and Atonement is a work of truly magical beauty and grace.  McEwan's writing makes the English language come alive with all sorts of powerful emotions and complex subtleties.  I can't say that Atonement is a particularly happy sort of book, but there's no reason why it should be.  Life's most important lessons are learned in times of sorrow and regret, and the lynchpin of this story is one girl's crime and the troubles that it brings cascading down upon a number of important lives with a terrible force, made even more tragic by the onset of war with the Third Reich.  Those looking for a light read may not find themselves immersed in Atonement; not only does it take a while for the novel to really take off, it is broken up into several somewhat drastically different narrative flows. It all works beautifully in the end, though, and casts a hypnotic spell over the reader.<br />First, we meet young, precocious, writer-to-be Briony Tallis and her family and friends.  The family home is suddenly filled with life again as Briony's brother and his friend from college come to visit - sister Cecilia having returned home from school a few months earlier, three cousins have moved in after their mother left her husband and ran off to Paris with another man, and Robbie Turner is once again a fixture on the landscape.  The son of a family servant, Robbie is an unofficial member of the family whose education has been financed by Briony's always-absent father.  On the particular day we meet these fascinating characters, Briony becomes an adult, throwing away childish dreams while seeking adult themes and stories to write, and a chance sighting of Cecilia and Robbie outside at the fountain sets the stage for a tragedy of immense proportions.  We soon move ahead a few years to witness the horrors of war during the British panicked retreat to Dunkirk, a riveting section of the book that is at first rather annoying given the fact that the first section ended at a point of high drama.  Briony comes to realize the gravity and unforgivable nature of what she has done, and we read about her first steps toward atonement in the third section, where she foregoes school to work as a nurse just as the war in Europe is rushing headlong onto England's very shores.  I found the description of the wounded soldiers and Briony's life as a nurse quite powerful and must admit feeling the onset of tears at one point.  The final section is an epilogue of sorts, taking us from 1940 all the way to 1999, and what we see is Briony still seeking to atone for what she did decades earlier.  The last few pages are infinitely sad, and I almost wish I hadn't read the last two pages because, in a way, they make these events even more tragic than they already were.<br />To a small degree, Atonement is a mystery of sorts, by which I mean to say that McEwan holds out several facts along the way, including one small bombshell, thereby keeping the story alive and riveting.  I think I am most amazed by his subtlety, however.  I was impressed by some really almost hidden parallels between the early and late portions of the novel; in most cases, McEwan simply inserts them for the careful reader to find and appreciate on his/her own.  Whereas many writers would go out of their way pointing blinking arrows at such little touches of complexity, McEwan simply slips them in with quiet grace.  I dare not say more about the plot than what I revealed earlier, but I have to reiterate my sense of wonder at this novel and its creator whom I consider, without the first qualm of doubt, a modern literary genius.hat is at first rather annoying given the fact that the first section ended at a point of high drama.

B000002UAU|1.0|&quot;Before Sgt. Pepper no one seriously thought of rock music as actual art. That all changed in 1967...&quot;.  Says who?  To hold this album out as &quot;art&quot; any more than other leading albums of 1967 is simply biased.  <br />First, this isn't rock music. Some of it is pop, and the rest, well, is ragtime, Indian, etc.  <br />Second, the real &quot;art&quot; was being released by Jimi Hendrix (Are You Experienced) and Cream (Disreali Gears) in 1967, which have certainly stood the test of time better than &quot;When I'm 64&quot;.<br />The song &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; is great.  So is &quot;A Day In the Life&quot;.  You can get these on the Beatles greats hits compilations.  And those are the only two songs you need out of Sgt. Pepper.  Mathematically, 2 songs out of 13 is worth less than one star. Sorry.
B00005LLK8|5.0|\\"A wonderful movie experience, in all the best senses of that phrase. Great story, acting, social relevance, music, dance, heart-felt emotion, a real pleasure.\\"  If the review is all that you wanted to hear, you can stop reading; the rest is a review of the reasons why I think 98 percent of the reviewers liked this movie (they EXPERIENCED IT!) and 2 percent did not, (they are the CRITICS).<BR>In my opinion, Cinema is the most powerful artistic expression of the 20th and 21st centuries, because it combines all the other arts (except maybe sculpture?) in ONE single mind-blowing experience.  You have visual art, photography, music, dance, drama, writing, acting, sometimes even mime, yes even poetry, AT THE SAME TIME.  What a concept!  <BR>As if that were not enough, they throw in satire, comedy, social comment, history, and education, and test your opinion on the social mores of the day (homophobia, feminism, anti-war feelings, patriotism, you name it).<BR>WHO CARES if sometimes the direction is forced, the acting is over the top, the story is predictable, the music is intrusive, the conclusion is inevitable, there is swearing, there is sex (sometimes), the realism is too much, and yes, your emotions are manipulated by Sony or Miramax.  SO WHAT!  <BR>I went to see La Boheme in Paris on my 21st birthday and guess what? I knew that Mimi dies!  The ballet fans who go to see Swan Lake and the opera fans who watch the Ring Cycle know the story! I have personally seen \\"The Matrix\\" six times, and I have read the Lord of the Rings at least 10 times, and seen the movies (2 of the 3) at least 4 times.  I have read War and Peace, (only once), even though I knew that Napoleon would lose.  My wife has read Gone with the Wind three times, and cries through the last 100 pages every time.  Art is art is art; and that is enough.<BR>We are not crazy: we immerse ourselves in the art we love, to celebrate the triumph of the human spirit, be it Literature, Film, Painting, Opera, Poetry, Ballet, Dance, Jazz, whatever.<BR>So critics, please take a break and get manipulated once in a while.  In these days of sterotyped TV soap opera and billion dollar professional sports (who cares?), lay back in your sofa with a beer or a glass of wine with someone you love, and let Billy Elliot wash over you.<BR>If you like it, you can buy it on video for less than the price of a book, and add it to your collection.  And if you don't like it, so what?  It is life, it is art, it is thought provoking; go to Blockbuster and try again.
B00005S6K8|4.0|They stayed true enough to the story with just enough modern updates.  A real fairytale.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|When Iron Maiden fans across the world saw the departure of, first, guitarist Adrian Smith, followed by legendary vocalist Bruce Dickinson back in '90 and '92, we must have thought that it was all falling apart. Janick Gers lived up to his place as a replacement and was spectacular at that, but Maiden fans alike will concur that Blaze Bayley just wouldn't do it for the band. So after the 8 years of what is known to us fans as the \\"Blaze Bayley era\\", when the news is broken that, not only has Bruce Dickinson returned, but Adrian is back as well! What about Janick..? Well, they kept 'em. Maiden is back with a scorching three-guitar lineup, with of course, Steve Harris and Nicko McBrain and Dave Murray remaining in the band as well. As you can imagine, the excitement was obligitory.<br />So now about the actual album. This one is the real thing. Talk about a comeback, on this release, Iron Maiden proves that they've still got it and they always will. The song production is great, triple harmonies and pounding rythm lines equal unforgettable songs. Some songs are a bit different sounding than classic Maiden, but it's all there. The solos, instrumental breaks, thick basslines, Nicko beating on his drums, and Bruce's wonderful vocals. Not to mention the couple of 9 minute ballads found on this..<br />Now, the songs.<br />The Wickerman - A perfect intro song. Fast paced, catchy chorus and nice riffs. You'll be singing this one forever.<br />Ghost Of The Navigator - I personally love this song. As usual, Maiden's lyrics are historical and intriguing. A somewhat slow song with a fast interlude.<br />Brave New World - This one is beautiful. The soloing is great, and the overall song is beautiful. Starts out calm and picks up momentum.<br />Blood Brothers - This is a touching song that Steve Harris wrote about his passed away father. Another classic and a great song.<br />The Mercenary - This song is one of the faster ones. A great song, yet another song with a catchy chorus and excellent other parts.<br />Dream Of Mirrors - This 9+ minute metal anthem is awesome. It takes awhile to get going but you will get lost in this song over and over again.<br />Fallen Angel - The intro to this one almost sounds like some good classic songs. It's pretty good, there isn't a bad song on this CD and this one holds it's place. Moderate speed I'd say.<br />Nomad - Here's another 9 minuter. Another one of Maiden's \\"middle eastern\\" sounding songs as well. If you liked Powerslave and Revelations you'll love this one.<br />Out Of The Silent Planet - This is quite possibly the coolest song on the album. It has been stuck in my head forever and I hope it does the same to you because it is a rockin' song.<br />Thin Line Between Love And Hate - The Closer. It's a good song to conclude the epic album. I didn't listen to this one as much as the others but it was still great. A little bit slower.<br />If you like Iron Maiden, buy this immediately. If you don't like Iron Maiden, still buy it because you will love them. If you don't know who Iron Maiden is, buy this. This is by far one of the biggest landmarks that Iron Maiden has made and this album should be owned by every fan of metal alive.
B00008J2DQ|1.0|When I heard that Godsmack's new album was going to be called \\"Faceless\\", I could barely contain my laughter.  Could that be more appropriate?  Godsmack seems to be content to release the same album over and over, with the same song over and over, with absolutely no redeeming qualities to their music.  The only way you can tell their albums apart, is that they up the distortion a little bit more on each one, which I guess is supposed to make it heavier, but really it just makes the already lousy tone even lousier.  <br />And there's the lyrics.  Does this album really have a song on it called \\"I F***ing Hate You\\"?  It wasn't just my imagination working from what I expected?  Oh my god.  <br />Also, Tony Stromboli, or whatever his name is, really needs to take some guitar lessons.  If you took away his wah pedal, I doubt he could even play a guitar solo at all.  <br />Yep, this album definitely hasn't done anything to change my mind about this band.  If anything, it's just reinforced it.  These guys need to take their own advice, and \\"go away\\".

B000001Y2U|5.0|I find this album to be very addictive.It starts out with a sense of chaos vs control music style in Irrespobsible Hate Anthem and then it breaks into 4 songs that have a real good sense of groove(The Beautiful People,Tied Up Dried And Dead To The World,Tourniquet and Little Horn.<BR>  Does the rest of the album add up to those 4 songs?You bet it does. The songs are very personal and well done.Worm Boy has an incredible sense of melody and mood,Cryptorchild is quiet but is one of the most polished songs on the album,Kinderfeld is a song about Marilyn's grandfather and the freaky things he did to disturb Manson's peace. Mister Superstar is both androgynous and shocking and also has some lyrics that deal with Marilyn's bisexual tendencies.For example &quot;Hey Mr Superman I wanna be your little girl.1996 is kind of the theme song for the whole album.Minute Of Decay takes the volume and aggresion down a notch and is really a great song but the brutal &quot;Reflecting God&quot; is Manson at his most aggressive. Man That You Fear is a very dark song and is a great closer for the album.I give Manson's Antichrist Superstar a 10 out of 10.
6302787297|5.0|This is a great movie. Why? Because it does make sincere attempts to be accurate and portray the characters as being living men and women. I think Gerard's performance is believable because as an Italian living in Spain, there must have been some language concerns - the two languages are similar but not entirely. Also, if you take a look at some of the writings of Columbus available at the Library of Congress... you will see that Gerard is protraying the man as he believed himself to be - a grand missionary of the Christian faith. Columbus does himself believe he is treating the natives with empathy - however, in his own words he \\"forces\\" some of them to assist him. I look forward to uncovering other documents which describe Columbus' views on the world and of the experiences of those peoples who ultimately suffered at the hands of the Spaniards (and perhaps Columbus himself). How many movies spark this kind of quest for knowledge? Need I say more?
B000002J20|5.0|I'll start out by saying some things about myself that may or may not be relevant. I am a YesHead; all the way. This is my favorite group of all time. Period. I listen to all kinds of music and own over three hundred classical CDs. I am classically trained guitarist. Have been to many classical concerts as well as jazz shows featuring the likes of Miles Davis, Chick Corea, John McLaughlin, Herbie Hancock and many others. Does this mean that I should be qualified to review \\"Tales\\"? Not necessarily. It just tells you a bit about myself; that's all. <br />As for \\"Tales\\", I will be as brief as possible. This is an INCREDIBLE recording. It is fragmented in many ways and if we were to only listen to it while doing the dishes or reading a book, then the fragmentation is further augmented. By \\"fragmented\\" I mean to say that this is a recording about ideas, instead of simply a recording about complete songs. If we head into this recording expecting to hear well-formed pieces of the intro-chorus-bridge-chorus-etc variety then we are in for shock. That's not what this recording is about.<br />This recording is about blowing your mind with some of the most incredible short musical stories ever put on tape. This is not to say that there aren't any \\"songs\\" on this recording. There all songs, but not the songs we are accustomed to hearing on the radio; even from Yes. This is not Roundabout or Owner of a Lonely Heart. This is Yes throwing their balls to the wall and giving us a monstrous amount of material that cannot possibly be assimilated in one, two or even one hundred listenings. <br />If there is any problem with this recording is that there is so much good music that never gets re-played. In other words, when you are listening to a passage that's totally blowing you away, the band never comes back to it again!!! That may or may not be a bad thing. That's where the fragmentation may be noticed; if one is to view it in such a way. Perhaps the \\"healthiest\\" way to view this fragmentation is that the band didn't want to do the same thing twice. After all, it's their recording, they should do as they feel. <br />I simply LOVE this recording and have gained further appreciation for it ever since hearing the band play \\"Revealing Science of God\\" last year in Denver; on Yes' Reunion Tour(Wakeman and White).  It was one of the MOST INCREDIBLE live shows I have ever been to.  <br />As for saying that Yes is \\"pretentious\\"? Well, if that were our sole criteria when judging music, or art in general, then we would have to discount the work of countless classical composers. Tchaikovsky, Beethoven and Bartok come to mind.  There's nothing wrong with BIG music. It's necessary sometimes to shock our senses with larger-than-life works. Minimalism has its place and time.  So does big music.<br />I recommend this recording for fans of prog rock bands like Genesis, Kansas, Emerson, Lake and Palmer; as well as fans of classical music who also enjoy more adventurous escapades into the unknown.<br />If I were to be going off into the proverbial desert island and could only take a handful of CDs, then this one would be going with me.<br />-JR

B00003CXA2|5.0|The best word to describe this movie is, magical. To enjoy it, one must suspend reality for a bit and simply, let it work it's magic on you. The story begins with a pan of a feather delicately falling from the sky to forrests' feet. Forrest is sitting at a bus stop and we see him begin to talk to a stranger. He begins telling them his life story, and the movie takes off from there. Forrest it turns out is a man with below average intelligence who was born with physical disabilities. Despite these disabilities his single mother raises him to be &quot;just like everybody else&quot; and he grows up to be as normal as possible. But he is different. Despite all his attempts to be just like the other kids he is a very unique individual, and that is his magic. <br />As it turns out his disability is not physical, nor is it intellectual. Rather, his disability is his heart. His heart is unable to feel any bad thought for anyone and his purity is the driving force of this movie. His innocence, like the symbolic leaf that falls in the beggining of the movie, makes him casually sway with the winds of change and he casually falls from one circumstance to another. <br />Free of any pretension or hidden agenda's no one can believe that he really is as open a book as he really is and this sets off a chain of events each as implaussible as the next. The film is a brilliant next step to the classic Peter Sellers hit &quot;Being There&quot;. It's a sarcastic romp through our past that critiques our society in a way Voltaire would be proud of. Taking naive Forrest through all sorts of insane situations where he blunders through and looks brilliant no matter how badly he screws up. A charmed life indeed. This isn't slapstick comedy, it must be said. It's very subdued and intelligent humour that needs to be taken with a small smirk rather than a loud gaffaw. This is Dennis Miller, not Andrew Dice Clay. This is Bill Cosby, Not Eddie Murphy. The scenes delicately set up the humour and thecircumstance is the punch line. The joke is intricately woven and expects you to pay attention to get it. But if you do, you are well rewarded for your efforts.<br />In one scene Forrest simply decides to run, and because he's running he just keeps going. The worlds disbelief at his audacious running just to &quot;do it&quot; inspires a whole generation of people to &quot;just do it&quot;, sound familiar?<BR>Suddenly he's leading a jogging craze across america, and when he finally stops, no one knows what to do. It's brilliant bitter sarcasm that puts society and all it's pretensions in it's place.<br />If you can sit back and take the movie for what it is, without allusions or expectations you will absolutely love this. It's brilliantly written with an endless stream of double meanings and subtle jabs at social conventions. This is a movie you can be proud to introduce to your children and inspire them to think critically about what they are viewing, or it's also a movie you can watch for yourself and have a smirk at how strange real life can be. It's a very intelligent movie that deserves a good viewing. This is the apocalypse now of comedy. Brilliant.
B00005JM93|1.0|Do you enjoy watching a woman get brutally raped at knifepoint, then being kicked in the face over and over again until she is unconscious? Is it a rollicking good time for you to see a man beaten to death with a fire extinguisher with his face literally knocked off? If these things excite you, then this is your movie. Don't believe the lie from Lion's Gate that this is an \\"art\\" film. It's a shameful stunt to get rear ends in the seats for a [bad] \\"film\\". ...
B00005JL3A|1.0|If he had had any sense, he would have done a direct adaptation of the game, like the killer novelization. But no, Anderson has to do his own thing, and he saps the plot of most of its intrigue, adding his own horrible touches. The movie's opening was confusing, the acting was mediocre at best, and the music, as usual, is totally forgettable. Any movie with zombies has the potential for being scary, but Anderson's pounding metal score ruined any atmosphere the film could have had. All of the monsters, save a horribly adapted Licker, are cut from the movie. The entire movie was painfully boring, save one scene involving a security laser, which was the only redeeming thing about this horrible film. If this reflects his adaptation plans for 'Resident Evil: Nemesis' or the dreaded AvP movie, then we're sure to be greeted with two more pathetic, horrible jobs.
B00005JL3A|1.0|I guess you might have to be a fan of the game in order to enjoy the movie.  But I doubt that even if that were true that one could derive any enjoyment out of this piece of trash.  There is one moment of pleasure, for all you gore fans, but that is the extent.  I hated almost every moment of it.  It is not that the story so much is awful, it is the execution.  And, the acting is not all that good either.  Don't waste your time on this one.
B000002U82|5.0|When I was at school in the mid-seventies I used to tell my mates that people would still listen to Dark Side of the Moon  in 30 years time. Of course my friends would say I was just a bit over the top. Now those who claim in 2003 that this album is overrated can just join the club of the ones who will never get it (where do you think the less inspired Radiohead and Coldplay stole all their stuff from?). The others with two ears in good functioning order know that with this album, Pink Floyd defined classical music, like Beethoven did it more than a century earlier. See you in 30 years.
B00005JKJA|3.0|I love Naomi Watts sooooo much that it hurts for me to say anything negative about a movie she is in.  But.... here goes.. I wanted sooo to like this movie.  In fact, I did like the first half of the movie.  It had good suspense, exceptional acting and it kept you glued to the screen.... Then.... it happened....<br />The second part of the movie.... What the hell happened????  I have no idea.. I actually should have known with it being a David Lynch movie and all.  I should have known that he would pull this on me, like he does every time in his movies.  I guess if you took the two seperate movies within the one movie you would have 2 very good ones.  But combined into one, you have one very confusing thing going on.  It is worth the watch just to see Naomi doing her thing.  Just don't expect too much from it, it will only disappoint you.
B000000OPQ|4.0|I didn't really like the movie, Vision Quest, but the soundtrack is really good.  It's likely to appeal to two audiences: 1) Madonna fans, and 2) 80s rock fans.  There's a nice balance between pop (Madonna, Style Council), pop-rock (Journey, John Waite, Foreigner), and hard-rock (Dio, Red Rider).  Of course, everyone's probably heard Madonna's \\"Crazy for You,\\" which was her first hit ballad (unless you include \\"Borderline\\").  It still sounds great, and is really quite beautiful and sweet.  You may not, however, have heard her second song on the soundtrack - \\"Gambler.\\"  It's more of an up-beat pop song.  Although it's clearly not one of her best efforts, I think that this soundtrack is the only place to get it.  My other favorite song on the CD is Dio's \\"Hungry for Heaven.\\"  I'm not a Dio fan, but this song is more melodic and poppy than most of their stuff - it's really great.  If you like other 80s soundtracks (e.g., Flashdance, Footloose), you'll probably really enjoy \\"Vision Quest.\\"

B00008H2LE|5.0|Here it is, the most anticipated album of 2003. And it doesnt get any better than this. I rushed to buy the album the day it came out, with the bonus DVD... paying only 15 bux for it and what a buy. Linkin Park I have to say is the best rock band since the year 1999 when i bought the Hybrid Theory EP (back when they were called Hybrid Theory, NO LONGER IN PRINT, VERY RARE). Then when Hybrid Theory LP came out I grabbed that CD as well. Then a year later they release the Hybrid Theory LP Special Edition with 2 bonus tracks. The cost of the CD was Huge but i grabbed that one anyway because nothing beats My December. Reanimation last year was an incredible Remix album, exploring the elements of all musics and collaborating with some of the biggest music stars of today. But METEORA just blows them all away.<br />01.Foreword - A nice intro to the CD with a storm in the background and Mike beating on his old CD burner till it breaks, flowing into...<br />02.Don't Stay 5/5- My GOD! This song is incredibly huge... The guitar riffs and the lyrical expression really hit ya in this song... as Chester screams about in the song ending with a message from a answering machine, flowing into...<br />03.Somewhere I Belong 4/5- The band's first single... when i heard this song played on the radio i was just amazed... a great wind/wavy type intro made by a inverted acoustic guitar. This song just sounds amazingly cool.<br />04.Lying From You 5/5- Prolly one of the best tracks on the whole CD. A great song to just scream too... chester just screams way to hard its just impossible for any cover band to match, flowing into...<br />05.Hit The Floor 4/5- Heres one of linkin parks rap-rock type songs... you really do feel like you've hit the floor with this track, jumps with a climax then falls. BIG HIT.<br />06.Easier To Run 5/5- This song reminds me so much of My December... Chester's voice is just so rythmic and beautiful. It really makes this track stick in your head after hearing it for the first time, flowing into...<br />07.Faint 5/5- 2nd single,The one step closer of the album... fast song and really cool to just jam too...

Has its ups but mostly downs. flowing into...<br />09.Breaking The Habit 5/5- This is the track everyone should listen to for about an half an hour. No guitar riffs... all just orchestrated and Dj. Dark and eerie, Taking Mike Shinoda 5, i repeat 5 years to complete...making it one of the best songs on the album. flowing into...<br />10.From The Inside 5/5- This song will be a single i bet, showing LP's hard rock side with a screaming chorus and destructive guitar riffs. Flowing into...<br />11.Nobody's Listening 3/5- I did'nt like this track very much... i dont know maybe its just the rapping type style and not much innovation. Still an ok track but just lets me down a bit. Flowing into...<br />12.Session 5/5- The instrumental of the track, Mr. Hahn really cranks the beat up in this track, kind of a remix of there Secret track on the EP. Sounds really cool, and ends with a chester screaming type tearing sound... Matrix Like!<br />13.Numb 5/5- A Perfect ending to the album, and My Favorite Track on the cd... This track literally leaves you NUMB... wanting more. Chester sings the chorus and the links... but Shinoda gets hit little verses in there, making the track just [AMAZING!!!]<br />The album i believe is a perfect follow up of Hybrid Theory... 36 mins of pure enjoyment...

B00003CWOL|2.0|I read a bunch of reviews on this site claiming this movie showed a comical look at \\"organized religion.\\" As a catholic, I thought I'd see the movie and , hey guess what? The only things they really made fun of were sterotypes of catholicism. Apparently, the other religions are perfect in every single way, and catholicism has no real place in today's culture, as the movie suggests. <BR>The movie, despite it's arrogant views, does offer its moments where it is pretty funny (The scenes with the voice of god come to mind). <BR>Overall, I feel this movie would have been a lot better if it simply didn't pick on stereotypes of catholicism, and actually addressed the issues that the movie tries to put forth.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|The Fellowship of the Ring soundtrack is where every theme in The Lord of the Rings trilogy begins.  Among the amazing themes are the Shire in &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot;, the ring theme mixed in everywhere which is very mysterious and creepy in a way.  We also get to listen to the Rivendell theme, Aragorn's theme in &quot;Amon Hen&quot;, and the whole Lord of the Rings theme in &quot;The Breaking of the Fellowship&quot;.  The Fellowship theme goes full blast in &quot;The Bridge of Khazad-dum&quot; and it will have you wanting to get a sword and fight after listening to it.  This music is extremely amazing and every musician should own a copy of it.
0345354435|5.0|I came accross A Clockwork Orange sheerly by accident. I was looking for another book entirely; however the title caught my attention, I read the back, and forgot about the other book.<br />A Clockwork Orange is an amazingly well written book. Burgess' Alex narrarates the entire story using his made-up Nadsat (teenage) language. On reading the first sentence, I was like, &quot;What the heck is this?&quot; It left me completely confused, yet I promise you, that by (at most) the 5th page, you will understand entirely what is meant by viddy (see), metso (place), litso (face), nogas (feet), horrorshow (fantastic), so on, so on.<BR> Anthony Burgess takes you into the mind of a teenage boy and asks you whether or not a person who does only good because they have no other choice is better of than a person who chooses to do bad. It is amazing and leaves you thinking and laughing all at once. YES, you heard me, LAUGHING! A person may be so cought off gaurd by what is happening to even realize that the book is laugh out loud funny. <br />Read A Clockwork Orange. Now. You'll love it. I Promise.
B00003CXBH|4.0|Roland Joffe's 1986 film, best known for its Oscar-winning cinematography, is presented in the original widescreen (2.35:1). Images appear crisp and damage-free, with deep blacks in contrast to the coursing whites of the waterfalls and the nitrogen-rich greens.<br /> Sound has been remixed into Dolby Digital 5.1.  The mix keeps most of the action in the front speakers, with too few atmospherics finding their way to the rear. Screenwriting master Robert Bolt's dialogue comes across loud and clear above the roar of the river. As good as this transfer is, those who remember the dazzling theatrical presentation may come away somewhat disappointed. &quot;The Mission's&quot; natural habitat is the big screen.<br />Joffe tells the tale of making &quot;The Mission&quot; in a commentary that is at least as interesting as the film itself. Disc 2 features a fascinating -- but flat and grainy -- BBC documentary about the production and the Waunana Indians who acted in the movie. (No other extras appear on the second disc, apparently added solely to preserve the quality of the film on disc 1). Joffe's commentary was recorded in the past year or so, while the hourlong &quot;Omnibus&quot; docu hails from 1986.<br />Joffe admits his commentary is &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; -- at one point wondering if his audience was still awake -- but he is a splendid storyteller with interesting ideas about man's place in the world. Curious viewers will need both the commentary and the docu to put together the story of &quot;The Mission.&quot; Unfortunately, there are no updates on the Waunana aside from Joffe's mention of a foundation set up for their benefit.

B00006879E|5.0|This is a fabulous cd. Great listening music.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I have to admit that I was skeptical about Christine not being on this CD - she adds a lot to their sound.  After listening to this CD non-stop for about 2 weeks now - I can truly say that they did an amazing job putting this together.  It is such a diverse album - many different styles all mixed together.  What else could you expect from Fleetwood Mac other than perfection . . . they did it again with Say You Will.  A definite buy for anyone who hasn't listened to them before or anyone who loves their music
B00004YM0D|5.0|Many &quot;soundtracks&quot; have little or no relation to the music used in the movie.  This soundtrack is true to the movie, AND every track on it is a song that I enjoyed hearing.  I would label this great driving music - superb for those long drives.  Although you might be careful of the energy of the tunes, you might find yourself driving a little faster than the law will allow.
B00005JKZU|5.0|I'm a big fan of the books (and when i say books i mean The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, and The Silmarillion) and the movies only made me love them more. I loved the The Two Towers especially Helm's Deep. I do admit it strayed a bit at parts, but i loved it no less. In fact i liked the added in stuff. Some of it helped me understand parts a little better. I loved every bit of this movie and i can't wait till the extended version, which will make it even better.
B00004XOWM|1.0|1 Star is low enough to express how terrible this album truely is.  Fred Durst might have a knack for finding unknown bands but apparently he doesn't put his own albums in the player too often.  Personally, I can't say I blame him.  Unoriginal and uninspiring songs fill this album.  If you do end up buying this album, at least you can feel good about knowing you can use it as a frisbee or a coffee coaster.  If you think Limp is the pinnacle of rap-rock, do yourself a favor and pick up any album by Rage Against the Machine.  You can thank me later.
B00008WG3U|2.0|while there are several good songs to be found on this record, it is, for the most part, boring. the songs sound like they were all written by different people; it is lacking cohesiveness. <br />i agree with the other fans that its great that they are voicing some political opinions, but this isn't the first time. the decline was excellently crafted and the songwriting was superb. it was twice as political as this. the half-dozen or so political songs here just take their respective issues and hit you over the head with them, crudely and unimaginatively. <br />i am very surprised that so few reviewers have called this nofx's &quot;first&quot; foray into politics; they must not have heard the decline.<br />it is quite ironic that there is a song called medio-core, which is about how all the mainstream music sounds boring and the same. the irony is soon killed though, when mike sings that the song itself is boring and unimaginative. <br />my advice-don't buy it yet. borrow and listen to it a few times, and then decide.

B000084T18|2.0|this cd is not all its cracked up to be.  sure everyone loves the infectious beats thanx to dre and em but what does 50 really have to offer?  his lyrical content is mediocre at best and he seems to be sweating one particular thug of the past...2pac.  &quot;i want them to love me like they love pac&quot;...uh no.  also check out the &quot;hail mary&quot; joint with em, busta, and 50...isnt 50's verse just a bit too reminiscent of pac???  sorry 50 but you aint the new 2pac.  2pac had much more to offer than thug appeal and tight beats.  im not mad at 50 for getting his cash but stop riding the 2pac/&quot;im a thug too&quot; train.  call it what ya want...im a hater or whatever but i smell alot of &quot;hype-nitis&quot; in here.
B000026OHN|5.0|I have listened to this recording since it was issued on LP in the early 1970s, and never tired of it.  Richter performed Bach throughout his long career, and these readings are among his best because his love for the music shines through with almost religious intensity.  His approach is lyrical; he sings each prelude and fugue, yet at the same time he's scrupulously aware of Bach's rhythmic and contrapuntal structures.  Some of his tempi are extreme: e.g. the C-minor prelude in Book I is played at whirlwind speed.  Unfortunately the sound is not very good, perhaps owing to the acoutics of the castle where the recording took place.  But the richness and intensity of Richter's playing makes up for everything.
B00005V3Z4|1.0|I cannot believe that this movie is receiving such high praise. I would easily rank this film as one of the worst movies I have ever seen (right up there with &quot;Spawn,&quot; and &quot;Cool World&quot;). The story line was very hard to follow and the characters were never fully developed. It almost seems like the director had a lot of ideas about how to piece together this film...but couldn't execute. This made for one long and drawn out movie. Let's put it this way...there is a reason why this movie lasted 5 seconds in the theatre.
0684833395|5.0|Bombardier Yossarian can be grounded because he's crazy, but if he asks to be grounded he will be declared sane and fit to fly; Major Major will permit any man to visit him in his office...as long as he isn't there; and Colonel Korn's education sessions only permit the men to ask questions who never do. These are just a few examples of the roundabout logic, self-defeating reasoning, and frustrating paradoxes that infest the text of Catch-22. Set in final months of World War II, Joseph Heller's novel depicts a world where the human language has become obsolete. Hardly a single exchange takes place that doesn't contain some form of self-contradiction or circular reasoning. Heller's stories of the horrors of war are a satire that is at one-moment whimsical and acidic the next.<BR>        Featuring an abundant cast of memorable characters, Catch-22 is a war novel that is much more. It is an allegory, a collection of running themes and recurring storylines. Told in a nonlinear storytelling style, Heller's novel captivates and demands attention, making reference to events in casual passing, only to return to them in increased detail. During an education session in Chapter 4, Yossarian, the book's protagonist, makes passing reference to Snowden, a man killed during a mission in which he was in charge. This incident is returned to with increasing detail as the story progresses, and it is in the book's blood-drenched climax that the full horrors of the event are recounted. <BR> One recurring theme in Heller's novel is faith. The character Chaplain Tappman is the ideal vehicle for Heller's musings; he constantly preaches the word of God, questioning The Almighty's existence all the while. On the subject of the bible, Tappman recalls one soldier asking, \\"Did it indeed seem probable...that the answers to the riddles of creation would be supplied by people too ignorant to understand the mechanics of rainfall?\\" Yossarian also offers his two cents on the matter in Chapter 18, referring to a certain Supreme Being as \\"'a colossal, immortal blunderer,'\\" saying, \\"'When you consider the opportunity and power He had to really do a job, and then look at the stupid, ugly mess He made of it instead, His sheer incompetence is almost staggering. It's obvious he never met a payroll. Why, no self-respecting businessman would hire a bungler like Him as even a shipping clerk!'\\" Its insights like these that make Catch-22 the joy it is.<BR> This questioning of faith and religion is justified, particularly in the environment of war, where ruthlessness and corruption are the status quo. Heller creates a world where a redeeming character is a rare and unusual blessing. Many of the book's characters are so self-absorbed it's a wonder how they came to men of respected standing in the first place. Colonel Cathcart, one of the story's central antagonists, is a prime example. A brown-nosing, elitist, social climber, He cares more about getting his picture into the next edition of the Saturday Evening Post than the well-being of his own men. If it weren't for the characters' military titles, one would hardly know this was a book about war at all. Heller doesn't glorify war or hold it on a pedestal, and it is through this jaded perspective that his reader begins to understand what war is really about. <BR> By the end of Catch-22, I had been run through a full gamut of emotions. I laughed at the irrational interrogation of Chaplain Tappman in Chapter 36, and I felt a sickness in the pit of my sickness as Yossarian witnessed poverty, death, and desperation wandering through The Eternal City in Chapter 39. Catch-22 is a thought-provoking, entertaining piece of literature, and its declaration as a modern-day classic is well-deserved to say the least.
0385504209|1.0|Having heard Dan Brown interviewed on NPR, I bought this book thinking it would be a cut above the standard thriller genre of airport paperbacks.  Unfortunately, the character development was one-dimensional to non-existent, the prose was on a sixth-grade reading level and the story was so implausible as to insult one's intelligence.  It is a shame that the years of research Brown discussed in detail with his interviewer produced such a disappointing result
B00008J4P5|2.0|No...more of exactly the same.  The White Stripes appear to have found their sound on &quot;De Stijl&quot; and made the same album over and over again ever since.  It's either Led Zeppelin or Paul McCartney with a bit of distorted hipster white boy sings the blues.  I thought they'd hit the usual third album rut with the solid but unadventurous &quot;White Blood Cells&quot;, but this is just more of the damn same.  Very disappointing.  If you need a White Stripes record then check out the first two releases (God knows that's what the White Stripes are doing).
038533348X|5.0|This apocalyptic novel by one of America's greatest satirical writers is an interesting view of what the end of the world may be like.  The hero, John (Johah, as he calls himself), begins work on a book about the bombing of Hiroshima, and ends up getting mixed up in the lives of the A-bomb's principal inventor's children.  Interestingly enough, the man who was most responsible for the atomic bomb is also largely to blame for the final destruction of human life.  <BR> <BR>Vonnegut may be a fatalist, and he certainly is a pessimist.  His bleak view of mankind, of science, of religion (as exemplified by the outrageous theology he creates) is nothing short of a wake-up call.  Vonnegut is immensely entertaining, and anyone who enjoyed Slaughterhouse Five or any of his other novels is sure to be pleased with this book.  Dark it may be, but this was, for me, one of Vonnegut's most enjoyable works of fiction.
0553208845|5.0|German writer, Herman Hesse, composes a rich novel about a man's spiritual quest for enlightenment. The main character in the novel is Siddhartha. His journey is a representation of the theme of circularity - where one cycle ends and another cycle begins. As an eager young man with an insatiable thirst for knowledge, Siddhartha progresses and undergoes truly profound transformations.<br /><br />After reading a few pages of the book, I was immediately hooked. Hesse wrote with such simplicity and grace. The pages seemed to flow right through my hands; I couldn't put it down. Although Hesse was German, he was very knowledgeable about eastern religions. This was evident throughout the entire novel, but it was especially clear in the Samsara chapter. According to Huston Smith, author of The World's Religion: Our Great Wisdom Tradition, Samsara is the \\"world that signifies endless passage through cycles of life, death, and rebirth.\\" In the Samsara chapter, Hesse vividly described the Hindu cycle of death and rebirth through Siddhartha. These cycles are seen throughout the novel again and again.<br /><br />For school purposes, I know that some people may not read the book and see the movie instead. Yet by doing so, you simply miss out on some real good writing. The book is very fascinating. One can learn so much from it.<br /><br />Highly recommended!!!
0385334206|4.0|Kurt Vonnegut, in the Preface to this book, says \\"This book is my fiftieth birthday present to myself.\\"  The result is a novel which is a little lighter, a little less focused, and a little more witty than his other novels.  One of the main characters of this novel is Kilgore Trout, a struggling (in fact, failed) writer who can only get his stories and novels published as filler for pornographic magazines and books.  Anyone who has read Slaughterhouse Five by Vonnegut will recognize Trout's name--the main character of that novel, Billy Pilgrim, spends some time in a hospital next to a man (Eliot Rosewater) who is Trout's ONLY fan, and who has a private collection of Trout's work which is larger than the one Trout himself has.<BR> <BR>Trout makes his appearance in this book when he departs for an arts festival in a small town called Midland City.  There his path crosses with Dwayne Hoover, a car dealer who is already a little off his rocker and is soon to be made completely insane by Trout's writings, which he takes seriously.  Though this was not my favorite of Vonnegut's novels, and though I did not enjoy the story as much as some of his other works, I could not help enjoying this book.  Vonnegut is a superb writer, a true master of his craft.  The drawings he includes are funny and add to the overall satirical effect of the book.  Vonnegut perhaps included that part about the book being a birthday present so it wouldn't be taken as seriously as some of his other novels.  I think the best part of this book is that it seems like Vonnegut wrote it just for the sake of writing, and that he didn't care what anyone would think of it. Breakfast of Champions certainly is not the masterpiece that Slaughterhouse Five or Cat's Cradle are, but it is nevertheless a very entertaining read.
B00004WG2F|1.0|This has to be the most stupid, boring movie that I ever wasted the price of admission on at a movie theatre. My friend who came with me actually walked out halfway through and sat in the lobby until I came out, dazed from the experience. I sat through the whole movie thinking that it had to get better at some point (which it didn't). <br />The plot is dull and hard to believe (someone whose life is already hell is killed by an eagle-eyed bullet ricocheting off of several rocks, I believe) and the acting not that good (I was totally unimpressed by Brad Pitt, who seems to be just as stupid as he is nice to look at). <br />I would recommend not to waste your money on this movie.
B000089RVX|4.0|bring me to live is overplayed on the radio just a little bit. i loved it when it first came out, but now i cannot stand it. love the slow songs on this album. my immortal is just a beautifully crafted peice of math. i love the guitar riff in &quot;tourniquet&quot; and ends with one of my favorite songs. i don't usually like girls trying to be all hard core, but this is just outstanding slash awesome. good stuff if i do say so myself. the only setback of the album is &quot;haunted,&quot; which is definatley haunting if that's what you're looking for. it doesn't do anything for me, however. get some jollies by checking out this album. good day.
0316666343|4.0|The Lovely Bones was an incredibly extraordinary book. The point of view from the main character was an eye opener. It was like 6 stories in one because you're presented with every ones point of view. While reading this book I had a little trouble understanding where I was. However at the end every thing comes together and everything falls into place. At one point of the story I couldn't put the book down I was so involved with the plot, which by the way really was a page turner (evidently). The only reason I didn't give this book 5 starts is because towards the end it dragged on for a while. And as your probably well know it can make you want to just quit the book. Please don't let that stop your from picking it up however, I think it is definitely worth reading.

B00000099Y|5.0|This is simple one of the most perfect rock albums I have ever heard.  I wouldn't even consider myself a &quot;tool&quot; fan, but none-the-less, every song is solid on Aemena.  You can't help but listen to the entire cd.  However, Tool takes a certain kind of patience to enjoy; most good bands do.  People will argue that they're &quot;weird&quot;, but they're weird because they're original.  When's the last time you heard a metal band have interludes of Germans talking about cooking?  But between the German Chef and the numerous other songs, there is a plethora of amazing tracks.  &quot;46 and 2&quot; is a personal favorite, as is &quot;third eye&quot; which is one of the most psychedelic rock songs I've ever heard.  The raw anger in Maynard's voice is haunting one second, and then soothing the next.  Even if you don't enjoy the album (which is highly doubtful), if you listen close enough, you will respect and understand why people are so obsessed with this band.
B00008PX8P|5.0|\\"It's been a long time since I've Rocked and Rolled.\\"  Yeah, baby this should be sweet.  I saw Robert Plant and Jimmy Page in concert in 1998 with two session musicians at the Cox Arena at San Diego State University and they blew the roof off the place.<br />I am sure this DVD will be well worth the wait and the money.  My hope is that fans will buy this DVD in droves and prompt Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, and Jason Bonham (John Bonham's son) to go on tour as Led Zeppelin.  What a great show that would be...I am keeping my fingers crossed, come on boys go on tour!

0385504209|1.0|This book is a great read; it is a page turner, but it's like the proverbial &quot;Chinese food.&quot; A few minutes after you have finished it you feel as if you've read nothing at all. I don't believe that the Catholic church cares one way or the other about the &quot;Holy Grail.&quot; The &quot;quest&quot; for this undocumented object is perpetuated by fiction writers, Hollywood producers, and misguided individuals who believe that objects can be endowed with supernatural power-the Jerry Springer crowd.<br />The great tragedy about this mystery book is that the writer wastes his time on this boring subject. He is multi-talented as a writer, but an untalented chooser of what to write about. Isn't this what editors and agents are for?<br />Try again, please, Dan, but next time choose a believable story.
0064430227|5.0|Twenty-five years after I last read the story of \\"Harold and the Purple Crayon\\", I picked up the book again to read it to my four-year-old son. He loved it! Several years later, I picked up a copy again to send to my grandson.... what amazed me about both those times (even with the lengthy intervals between them) was that I had forgotten nothing. The pictures were burned into my mind's eye; the text still a part of my memory. I found that I could recite the story of Harold and his crayon without even looking. <br />This is a true celebration of the imagination, and in my opinion the very best children's book ever! It has a profound impact on adults as well as children, and it is infinitely delightful. (I even learned my very first play-on-words/pun from Crockett Johnson's classic (near the end of the book, when Harold \\"drew up the covers\\").<br />\\"Harold and the Purple Crayon\\" is the first and by far the best book in Crockett Johnson's \\"Harold\\" series, but it is not necessarily Johnson's best work. That distinction is reserved for his old \\"Barnaby\\" series of comic book stories, with the memorable Fairy Godfather Mr. O'Malley (hmmmm... come to think of it: Barnaby and Harold look a lot alike-- could they be related?).<br />If you have children emerging from the theatrical threes and heading into the fabulous fours, try them on \\"Harold and the Purple Crayon\\". It is a masterpiece of perfect simplicity and imaginative joy!
0375414053|5.0|This book was so funny and sincere. I loved it. It's a great book for any new mom who has struggled with the feminist obligation of achieving success and breaking through that glass ceiling... I can't wait for Allison Pearson's next book!
B00000J7SS|5.0|Applying the hard beats to jazz has often served to cheapen the spontaneity of it.  When Miles Davis does fusion, however, it is going to be great.  The musicianship on this album is tremendous.  The preponderance of electronic or non-wind instruments encourages a lack of feeling in music.  That Miles employs three electric pianists (Joe Zawinul, Larry Young, Chick Corea), however, does not (in this case) cheapen the music.  These musicians are SO GOOD that there is no way it won't sound amazing.

B00005QGAX|4.0|This album had the anxious fate of following \\"Off the Wall\\" and \\"Thriller,\\" which are two of the most important records in recent memory.  \\"Bad\\" has often been seen as vastly inferior to Jackson's previous work.  On this album, Michael Jackson leapt into the role of the writer/producer, which may explain why it might not function in the constantly intense way that the two polished records before it were.
B000006TRV|5.0|This is one of the best albums of all time. Pink Floyd adresses everything lyrically from childhood, war, education, love, heartbreak, nervous breakdown, etc. Some of Pink Floyd's finest songs such as &quot;Run like Hell,&quot; Comfortably Numb,&quot; and &quot;Young Lust&quot; are on this album.
B00005QGAT|5.0|Michael Jackson's \\"Off the Wall\\" was mostly the work of producer Quincy Jones.  Jackson wrote only three of the songs on the album.  The original demo from 1978 of \\"Don't Stop `Til You Get Enough\\" on the special edition version, with brother Randy and sister Janet accompanying him, is extremely fascinating.
0316096199|5.0|Ideally, I considered this book quite interesting and very formal in the description of Alice Sebold's rape.  I thought this story proved to be an astounding story of a young, eighteen year old woman's will to go on and accomplish the biggest mmilestone in her life.  This book very throughly takes us from the p[erfect life of a college freshman with so much to offer and look forward to, down to a scared, feared Alice.  Alice's rape has cost her grief, pain, and resteration.  What I thought was amazing about the book was that even though Alice had been stripped away from her pride, she still manages to go on and achieve new heights and overcome her rape.  Alice comes accross a few characters whom help her through.  Alice's character is very strong willed and independant.  It's nice to read about something you believe and instill faith in.  Alice instilled faith in herself, and nshe never gave up.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Quite good, adding depth and emotion to an amazing movie. The LOTR would not be nearly as good without Howard Shore.

055357342X|5.0|In the third book of the predicted series of 6, Martin has managed to pick up the story and slam it home to readers that he knows how to write. Unlike book two, this book focuses on the key characters rather more precisely and concisely. Some of the detail is dropped, which makes it less devilish to tackle. There are rather fewer people to remember, which made it less hard on my brain and helped to deliver a focused, and overwhelmingly drawing story.<br />It is in \\"A Storm of Swords\\" that readers come to know the characters more closely and become drawn into their dilemnas, their choices and in some instances, their helplessness. Most of all, their temptations. It is these human aspects that brings the characters to life. And it's not stagnant - as in real life, the characters of this book change over time. We find an unlikely hero in the Hound, a sympathetic trait in Jaime Lannister, a demon in the Imp's whore. Arya, despite all her best efforts, never gets closer to home, and decides a new fate for herself. Jon Snow also meets with destiny, as does his half brother Robb. And there is sacrifice.<br />On the other side of the world, Martin demonstrates impressive writing skills in telling the story of Dany and the Unsullied (the short version was published independently, and I was attracted to it even then). Yet, she too, meets a limit to her power and exploits and learns that she needs to learn how to rule, not only to plunder and conquer.<br />It is the realism that Martin so successfully brings out in his characters that I particularly like. Each individual has hopes, desires, hates, loves, strategies that succeed and fail. They are, above all, human.<br />An outstanding effort from Martin and the most brilliant book in the series yet. Against my expectations, it was not tiring but invigorating, and has whetted my appetite for more to come in the series. I didn't even mind spending all the money on a hard-cover version!<br />An absolute \\"must\\".<br />*
0380820846|4.0|This was a fun, light historical romance.  No mystery &amp; suspense like I've been reading lately, but I like a change of pace every once in a while.  If you've liked Julia Quinn's other historicals, you'll probably like this one also.  It's not as good as 'How To Marry A Marquis', but I still enjoyed it.  It's cute &amp; comical &amp; didn't do that &quot;she hates him, he hates her, til they fall in love&quot; thing that so many historicals do.  That's a relief to me.  I can't believe JQ actually reveiled Lady Whistledown in this one!  <BR>I think everyone needs a friendship like Penelope &amp; Eloise; I have one &amp; it lifts me up &amp; puts me back on track when I think nothing can.  Happy Reading!
B000065U6O|3.0|Because of my personal beleifs against what this film stands for (as is the case with Birth of a Nation), I cannot give it more stars than this.<br />However, one cannot deny that this is brilliant propaganda. One can see how Germans of the 30s and others who were ignorant of what Hitler really stood for could be suckered by this film. There are no anti-semetic messages (or any mention of Jews for that matter), no scenes of violence, no concentration camps, etc. anywhere in sight. Basically, just an orderly nation at work who happily greets it's \\"leader.\\" The basic message that the unthinking mind gets from this film is \\"Say It Loud, I'm German and Proud.\\"<br />This film is a prime example of why people need to cross-reference what they see. Those who are ignorant of true history and accepts this as the sole point of view will continue the disease of facism.
B00000099Y|5.0|I used to hate Tool. I had never really given them a chance and I didn't really feel like wading through the cd because all the songs have really long intros and it was bothersome. Both Aenima and Lateralus were shoved in my closet somewhere. One day i was staying home from school with like a 103 fever so i figured I'd give al these cds I never really listened to another chance (the strokes, jimmy eat world, american hi fi, <which were shoved in my closet for good reason> and then TOOL!) Wow. Tool is one of my new favorite bands. Maynard has an incredible voice. Aenima is tools best CD. With the opener Stinkfist, to the last song Third Eye, this Cd just rocks. My fave songs are Stinkfist, Aenima, and Hooker with a Penis which has one of the coolest choruses I've ever heard. If you like artsy music with an edge Tool is definetely for you. Their lyrics rival those of Cobain and the musicianship is the best I've ever heard from a metal band. Danny Carey is a virtuoso on the skins. If this review isn't enough to make you go out and spend every last penny you own on this band (by an Aenima for every day of the Week! :)) then just listen to em for yourselves you will not be disappointed.
1559409010|5.0|I've followed a few!<br />This is probably the Python's best work. They use the backdrop of early christianity to offer some of their best and most absurd comedy. As usual, the chaps play numerous roles throughout the film (except for Graham Chapman, who plays Brian) and are hysterically funny in each one.<br />This is the film that gave us &quot;The bright side of life&quot; and the Judean People's Front and their suicide squad.<br />As for the DVD, it includes a few deleted scenes and some radio ads, but the true treasure are the two commentaries by the remaining members (Graham Chapman passed away in 1989), one by John Cleese and Michael Palin and the other by Eric Idle and both Terrys, and the documentary. They give great insight as to how the filming came along, how their relationship was like and what their lives were after they became celebrities thanks to their TV show.<br />Do yourself a favor and get this DVD right away!!
0316666343|3.0|My husband bought this book for my birthday, and with all the hype I was excited to get into it. The book, in essence reminded me of Alice Walker's 'By the Light of my Father's Smile.' Beautiful prose I suppose but I became drained and perhaps even bored by the dreamy overdramatization. Three stars because Sebold provided an excellent depiction of a family displaced and trying to cope and thrive in the face of a tragedy.

B00006F1IJ|4.0|I met Greg Carmichael and Nick Webb at a show in Ranch Cordova California some years ago. I was saddened by the death of Nick Webb as I felt he was a truely visionary guitarist. I have travelled around the country ever since to see them play.  As a musician and guitarist, I was attracred to the unique fore front of guitar arrangements on their earlier albums and evolved with them into a true affecianado of their mature and eloquent sound.  I reccommend not only this retrospective, but any of their other albums for the musician and non musician alike who will surely enjoy their soaring rythmns and artistic arrangements and production. There is nothing quite like a late night, a bottle of wine and making love while the poetic music of Acoustic Alchemy accentuates every beat of your lovers heart.
0316096199|5.0|Pertaining to the novel, \\"Lucky,\\" a young, eighteen year old college freshman was brutally raped and beaten in a park off campus late on night.  This novel truly stounded me!  Alice's ability to recover from her tragic experience and keep going with her life.  Alice's ability to rebuild and construct her life was absolutely remarkable.  Of course, Alice did recieve a little help from her friend Tricia at The Rape Crisis Center, and her lawyer Gail, whom was sort of like Alice's role model.  I believe in order for Alice to go on she must first find a place inside of herself to shine again.  Alice accomplishes this horrific feat by facing her fears and reliving that dismal night of shame.  Overall, I believe Alice grows and prospers with every step she takes to eventually put her rape behind her.  In the end all of Alice's hard work and will pays off when she can finally sleep at night knowing that she has sought justice and is finally at peace with herself.
B000005RS1|5.0|This is a combo of two live EPs from the early 80's (not really a box set).<br />It's interesting to listen to it to get a feeling of what the band was like back when it was starting to gain a bit of fame. It's the only place to listen to some of the early songs in concert, as sang by Fish...a real nice complement to 'The thieving magpie'...it's also one of the few places to find the studio version of 'Freaks'

B00008DDXL|5.0|The last HP Movie \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\" was a marvelous adaptation of J.K. Rowling's first Harry Potter book and was hard to pull off onto the big screen but it was almost completely successful and truly amazing. The follow-up \\"Chamber Of Secrets\\" is even better, longer, darker, and more suspenseful than the first one. This is one of the best examples of the \\"Sequel Upswing\\". Director Chris Columbus truly brings out the magic of Harry Potter onto the big screen and maintains the faith and magic of Rowling's novels. There are some occasional humor jokes scattered throughout an other dark movie.<br />The second installment in the movie series begins with Potter being locked up in his room at the house of his horrible Aunt Petunia Dursley, Uncle Vernon Dursley and his stupid and spoiled cousin Dudley Dursley in the London suburb of Surrey and thinks that his friends Ron and Hermione have forgotten him after not getting single reply from him Ron and his twin brothers bust him out of the Dursley's house. The movie brings the Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley, and Hermione Granger trio into a much darker arena. The darkness of the dangers is first evident when an elf named Dobby comes to the awful Dursley's house and warns Potter not to return to Hogwarts this year. Potter though goes to Hogwarts in defiance of Dobby but runs into problems at platform 9 and ¾ but that's not the main danger and Harry, Ron, and Hermione face much more dangerous events that threaten Hogwarts as a secret underground chamber called the Chamber Of Secrets has been opened by none other than the 'heir of Slytherin'. They must find how who the heir of Salazar Slytherin is as he is the one who knows where the Chamber is. During that time, several questions arise in who opened the Chamber of Secrets when Harry finds a little diary from a Hogwarts student from 50 years ago named Tom Riddle and also find a monster responsible for the death of a Hogwarts student around the same time as well. It gets darker and more intense as the movie progresses.<br />We also meet new characters and including his archenemy Draco Malfoy's tyrannical father Lucius Malfoy played by Jason Isaacs. The rivalry between Harry and Draco also seems to grow bitterer as they get older especially with Malfoy's increasing bigotry against normal humans aka muggles and belief that 'purebloods' (born to magical parents) are superior to all half-bloods and muggleborns. I just hope that it doesn't reach to like a 'fight to the death' kind of rivalry though or Draco becoming the 'next Voldemort' but you never know. Still though, it's fun to watch Malfoy hit major speed bumps when trying to act out his rivalry against Potter but unfortunately winds up endure embarrassing accidents as a result. Severus Snape is once again the cold mean mysterious Head of Slytherin House Teacher. The main thing though in this movie that slightly disappointed me was that there wasn't enough of the mysterious character Severus Snape. He's one of my favorite characters and he should've been given a much larger role in COS. Oh Well.<br />There are three main unsettling scenes though for younger viewers or those who hate creepy-crawlies. There are lots of them in the movie and it will creep the living daylights out of those who have revulsion towards snakes. 'Snake Lovers' though like most people, will definitely enjoy this movie a lot. There are also quite a good number of spiders in the movie too. Scenes like these will scare the living daylights out of those who suffer from arachnophobia and fear them like the plague. Arachnophobics (Correct me if I'm wrong) might want to hold on tight on the seats when the spider scenes come during various parts of the movie. For me though, I'm not scared of either snakes or spiders so they don't bother me in this movie at all. In fact, these are among my favorite of the creepy-crawly animals so there you have it. I actually enjoy the spiders but let's not warp the subject of this reviewthough. The third scene is the bloody writing on the walls of the dormitory hallways and it can frighten some skittish viewers. For me, none of the three things bother me at all. In fact, the creepier feel of this movie makes it even more entertaining than the previous Harry Potter movie. Just for a little extra, I've even had a pet snake many years ago. ;-)<br />The choreography is once again astonishing. The \\"Enchanted Car\\" flying through the air was eye-popping and was great to watch instead of being cheesy and silly. The Quidditch match was much more addicting and eye-popping to watch than the match in the last movie and that one was awesome too just so you know. I wouldn't be surprised of \\"Quidditch\\" winds up being added to the dictionary. I think that's one of the best made up words of all time. Overall, I have to say that \\"The Chamber Of Secrets\\" is a successful achievement and builds upon the success and greatness of \\"Sorcerer's Stone\\", resulting in a near-masterpiece if not an epic one. The movie is much longer than the last one, running at 2 hours and 40 minutes, scarier with occasional scenes that might be a little frightening for younger viewers, and much more suspenseful than the last one.<br /> Despite the frightening and darker tone of \\"The Chamber Of Secrets\\" and the bumbling of Gilderoy Lockheart, it is a fascinating and astonishing achievement in adapting Rowling's second novel to the big screen and is destined to become another classic in the years to come. Now begins the wait and anticipation for the third installment \\"Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban\\" due out in 2004. I give my hats off to Chris Columbus and company for creating another great Harry Potter movie.ew though.

B000002UKS|5.0|I was skeptical at first when I inherited this CD from a friend because much of my rock collection is sort of &quot;old school,&quot; and I was afraid that it would sound like a Nirvana knock off.  BUT this CD has quickly become an important part of my road trips - especially for the mornings! It is mature, it is beautiful and it totally rocks! It is diverse collection of well crafted tunes filled with the artists' heart and soul. It's music that you wanna sing along with and the ballads are deeply touching. I am now looking for more stuff by the Foo Fighters.  And if you have ever seen Dave Grohl interviewed on TV - don't miss it.  He's a very interesting person because he's just a regular guy...
0316096199|5.0|Pertaing to the novel, \\"Lucky,\\" I percieved this book to be quite astounding and miraculous.  I mean the story of a young, eighteen year old college freshman being brutally raped and beaten and her triumphant will and strenght to go on with her life or at least what was left of it.  What I loved most about the book was the idea that despite Alice's horrific rape, she still manages to go on to the next milestone in her life.  Alice does indeed learn to trust and confide in herself as well as other people.  Tricia is one of Alice's peers from the Rape Crisis Center and Alice feels that the two of them are on the same page, dealing with rape and all.  Alice feels like she can talk and confide in Tricia and that in return she will understand.  Alice also comes accross Gail, her lawyer.  Gail is everything Alice wants to be and accomplish.  Gail throughout the story prepares Alice for the enevidable and instills in her faith and hope.  Gail is in a way a sort of role model for Alice.  The toughest challenge Alice has to face is convicting and facing Gregorey Madison, her rapist.  Alice won't stop until he is behind bars.  Overall, I thought this novel was a page turner and it gave me alot of honor to read it.  Alice Sebold is an amazing woman.
0345350499|5.0|Without any doubt, &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; is one of the few colossal achievements in the fantasy genre from the last thirty years.  It boldly replays all the significant parts of the Arthurian saga from the perspective of the female characters, focusing mainly on Guinevere and Morgaine.  In Bradley's hands, they become fully rounded characters, as we see how their upbringings and differing worldviews lead up to the roles they play in the story that we all know and love.  None of the minor characters, male or female, are neglected.  They are all developed carefully, with realistic motivations.  In &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot;, less time is spent on warfare and battles than in most earlier versions, and more is devoted to looking at aspects of medieval society that we rarely hear about, ranging from medicine to religion to childrearing.<br />The first hundred pages of &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; are, in my opinion, the best part of the book.  They cover the life of Igraine and of Uther Pendragon, and give a glimpse of what British society was like prior to Arthur's birth.  After that, we get a lengthy section dedicated to Morgaine's training as a priestess on the island of Avalon, and the introduction of Guinevere and Lancelot.  The middle section of the book proceeds at a much slower pace, with lots of attention being paid to the development of all of the main characters.  The story then picks up at the end for a very impressive finish.  I particularly like the beautiful descriptions throughout the book, and the way that different literary elements are blended to create wonderful images.<br />Some readers have commented that the book is anti-Christian.  I have to disagree with this.  It does have some Christian characters who are portrayed negatively, but plenty that are portrayed positively as well.  And although she goes a little bit over the top on a few occasions, Bradley is generally accurate in her depiction of theology in the Middle Ages.  I don't think that she is opposed to Christianity as much as opposed to anyone who has become completely inflexible in their worldview.  This may not be clear at the start of the book, but it is definitely obvious by the end.<br />Bradley began her career writing short stories and then moved on to science fiction novels.  She first became famous with the Darkover series, which is, in all honestly, pretty lousy.  When writing &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot;, however, she took the time to carefully construct her plot and think through her dialogue and descriptive writing.  The result is one of the masterpieces of modern popular literature, and a work that will certainly be remembered as a fantasy classic for many generations to come.
0380789019|4.0|Of course, Neil Gaiman's first novel has been compared to &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and his own Sandman comic series, but what this story most embodies is a Campbellian Hero's Mythic journey.  This includes almost every element of Campbell's journey:  a call to adventure, threshold crossing, the tests (complete with helpers), transfiguration, and return to the world.  Gaiman's  also touches on these themes in his later work &quot;American Gods&quot;(and probably better there than &quot;Neverwhere&quot;) and I think, no one is writing mythological stories as good as Gaiman right now.  Gaiman manages to write about these themes with a wry sense of humour that never detracts from the importance of the stories he tells.  This novel gets 4 stars instead of 5 only because I read &quot;American Gods&quot; first and I'm rating them relative to each other.
B00005B4GU|5.0|This is yet another brilliant Radiohead release.Thom Yorke has the most beautiful voice Ive ever heard, and the music manages to be hip, ecletic, and heartfelt and gorgeous and deep at the same time. I can totally relate to every single word they're saying.This is a must.
0060512806|5.0|Neal Stephenson's Cryptonomicon is everything but science fiction, but it somehow has a science fiction feel to it.  Perhaps this is because Stephenson constantly alternates narrative between the past (WWII) and the present - also the fact that the story focuses on the nature of information technology and how information can impact human lives and world events over time and distance.  The cryptography in this book alone is enough to blow your mind - add to that a layed back, ultra cool marine in WW2, an absent minded pipe organ player, a computer programmer with an unusual family, and one of the coolest treasure hunting chicks ever conceived.  At times, this story does give you the head-spins due to an &quot;all over the place&quot; storyline, but still it gets five stars for sheer magnitude...

B000003S5H|5.0|Not to go over board with this, but in my opinion, Air's Moon Safari is, hands down, the best electronic album made to date.  Jean-Benoit Dunkel and Nicholas Godin, the french duo that makes up Air created  a sonic masterpiece that captured a style and atmosphere there transcends time and place.  This album has stayed as fresh sounding and vibrant as the day it came out; and this is quite a feat in a genre where most music sounds dated within 6 months.  This is not cheesy kid's electronica - these compositions will embrace you like a warm summer day and move your soul.
0066214122|5.0|great read, could not put the book down. Crichton writes in  down to earth, everyday speek. like talking to a pal or normal dude. When reading preview that this was about nanotech I was sceptical. He mixes hitech, everyday erands of a stay @ home dad and some crazy scifi sh!% with perfect balance the end was alittle bananas but kept you on the edge of the couch. I will read more of his books. Crichton does his homework, read the foot notes.
B00004WG2X|4.0|i've seen both this and the a&amp;e version and think both have their strengths and weaknesses. this version is more faithful to the book, inlcuding more scenes and dialogue. not all the characters are well cast, however. jane, for example, was not particularly pretty or sweet. and david rintoul, although he looks like mr darcy, is just too stiff to be appealing.  the a&amp;e version, on the other hand, is very well cast - i can't think of a single character who doesn't look or act like he/she should. and the production value is far superior, as you would expect of a recent film. but it does abbreviate most scenes and even omits a few. it also has far less of austen's dialogue. both are worth watching. i do prefer the a&amp;e version, though. it's more fun - and funny - to watch!
0066214122|5.0|Chrichton's prose gets better with every new book: the story is gripping, the prose is &quot;no nonsense&quot; and the atmosphere is superb. <br />I read a review of &quot;Prey&quot; on powells.com. The reviewer objected some sentence in a book and failed to recognize why Chrichton wrote this story: no matter how great the technology is, the issues of ethical behavior, greed, lack of foresight and &quot;Human Nature&quot; will remain in the forefront, with a great potential for disasters.<br />I enjoyed the story, the research behind it and great prose.
B00006ZXSK|3.0|This is cinderella with a twist: a lead character with serious Feminist Attitude. Forget about saving the poor little girl with the wicked stepmother. This lady can save herself, thank you very much; and if that stepmother would only get out of her hair, she'd be just fine in her own house. The prince is just an afterthought. Icing on the cake. An unnecessary luxury. Whatever. The film is a fantasy and has to be seen that way. The characters are all one-dimensional and none change save the prince who comes off his high-horse to wed the girl. But it's not a satisfying change, not realistically done. But heh, it's a fantasy. Worth a watch, but there are plenty of cinderella-derived stories that are more enjoyable. Like Bridget Jones's Diary, or Pride and Prejudice.
B00008K7AM|4.0|After critics totally bludgeoned this movie, I decided to wait for rental.  I'm not sure I made the right decision because this was actually funny and taught some good life lessons along the way.<br />Rob Schneider is able to pull off a gender-swapping mishap when the high school's snotty princess five-fingers a pair of ancient earrings with transmuting powers.  As fate would have it, they each put on one of the earrings, wake up the next day and the fun begins!!  <br />The writing is surprisingly good with some hilarious scenes, especially in the bar.  Matthew Lawrence adds some nice eye candy as the love-lorned boyfriend to the princess now in a man's body.  As the story concludes, the princess makes right with many people she's wronged, helps her parents heal their marital wounds and discovers what true friendship really is in her best friend April.<br />All in all, this movie didn't deserve the beating the critics gave it...but after all, it's a modern day comedy and these types of movies seldom fair well with a bunch of pent-up, old foggies.  'Nuff said!

B00008V2VM|2.0|After World War III nearly destroys all civilization, humankind decides that war and violent crime must be avoided at any cost. In order to prevent violence, all emotions and items that might elicit emotions are prohibited. Everyone must take Prosium, an emotion-suppressing drug. Those who refuse to take the drug are labeled &#34;sense offenders&#34; and are hunted down and destroyed by the State's elite police force, the Grammaton Clerics. John Preston (Christian Bale) is a Grammaton Cleric of the highest order and dedication. When he accidentally skips a dose of Prosium one day, his newfound emotions cause him to question the wisdom of his emotionless society. He is recruited by the Underground, an outlaw pro-emotion movement, to take on a seemingly impossible mission: assassinate the political leader behind the State control of emotions and free humanity from the tyranny  of Prosium.<br /><br />Equilibrium's costumes, camera angles, martial arts sequences, and Grammaton Clerics are straight out of &#34;The Matrix&#34;. Its story and themes take inspiration -to put it mildly- from Ray Bradbury's &#34;Fahrenheit 451&#34;, Aldous Huxley's &#34;Brave New World&#34;, and George Orwell's &#34;1984&#34;, to name a few. Borrowing ideas from other sources is not necessarily a bad thing, and those are great source materials. But Equilibrium amounts to a handful of action sequences among some badly rehashed ideas. There are some unspectacular sword fights. The martial arts gun battles are unusual and eye-catching, but they move so fast that it is difficult to actually see much of them. Christian Bale's performance as John Preston is probably the best thing about this film. Taye Diggs is unconvincing as his partner, an ambitious, smarmy young Grammaton Cleric. One problem is: smarmy implies emotion. The doughy Big Brother-like leader of this Brave New society seems more like a couch potato than a despot. And most of the story simply doesn't make sense. If you are a connoisseur of action flicks, the martial arts gun sequences are unique and might be worth a look. Otherwise, skip it. A word of warning: This film is very violent. It is graphic. And much of the violence is totally gratuitous. I don't normally mind violent movies, but the slaughter-for-its-own-sake attitude of this movie made me cringe.on flicks, the martial arts gun sequences are unique and might be worth a look.

0743244249|5.0|Don Delillo is the perferct author to try to understand the rise and collapse of the economic bubble as the century flipped into Y2K.  He has penetrated a number America's peculiar cultural hysterias: environmental fears (White Noise); conspiracy theories surrounding the assassination of John F. Kennedy (Libra); Moonies and mass marriages (Mao II), and now this latest mass hypnosis masquerading as economics.  The objects of Delillo's scrutiny are cultural phenomena rather than human foibles. His characters become icons for certain events, metaphoric translations.  They could not endure quotidian existence.  They are not human, and this quality may repel some readers.  Yet, there is satisfaction in the way Delillo gives articulate form to something the reader will have sensed, something recognized as familiar in recent experience.<br />Delillo also has a wonderful sensitivity for words.  He makes some fun observations here about the argot of the Internet and high tech culture.  I had not before recognized what a quaint anachronism \\"Automated Teller Machine\\" is.  Delillo treats his readers to a number of such observations about our language.  I believe that Don Delillo's \\"Underworld\\" was without rival the best fictional work about America in the twentieth century.  This is a much narrower work, but it displays the wit and penetration that shines in Delillo's best works.
B00000DLUV|2.0|I expected the trio to sound just as good as they did years ago and I was disappointed.  Barry Gibb does not sound as good. The music on this CD was better than the vocals. I only liked 3 out of the 24 songs listed on the CD ( You Should Be Dancing, Night Fever/More Than a Woman, and How Deep is Your Love).  Only a true Bee Gee fan would love this CD, but then again, they would love anything the Bee Gees produced. I'm going to search for CD's of the orginal recordings because I know those recordings will sound as good as I remember them.
B00008DDSC|5.0|As stated in my review title, I feel that the film is much better than the short story on which it is based.  Gaitskill's story is well-adapted (and is quoted verbatim during the film), but I'm glad to see that the film did a little more with it.  Gaitskill's story seems to start off strong and then just abruptly finish with this hunky-dory moment where the love story is so wonderful, and her descriptions of key scenes are so brief that they might as well have never happened.  The film goes much deeper with the characters and plays out the scenes to their greatest effect.  So many people that I've talked to love this film because it is just such an amazing love story, and I don't think you understand that so well with the short story..  Highly, highly recommended.
B00008S2VH|2.0|Disastrous has got to be the word when you consider that Warner Bros is behind this gargantuan rip-off of a 'Limited Edition'. To me this is probably the worst Limited Edition in the history of CD Pressings - its that bad. Not only is this the exact replica of the lower-priced regular 'American Life' CD, the only 'Special Feature' the CD has is a weblink to Madonna's official website! Considering that you can log on to the web and type the URL yourself, this is not much of a recommendation. Very annoying indeed. For some reason, the manufacturers thought it necessary to give us a bunch of 'American Life' logo stamps (on cheap paper that fades within days) and a semi-large poster of the cover of the CD (the only 'Special Feature' here is that its double-sided). The 'box' it comes in is actually a light-weight paper box with an embossed cover that does nothing really special. It just sits there and looks menacing. I didn't really know what the term 'a waste of money' meant until I went out and bought this for full retail. Argh. That said, lets move on to the review of the musical content of the album.<br />Listening to 'American Life' about ten times over the last two days, I have to admit there are moments of genius in it, though not enough to merit the embarrassingly glowing comments I see here on this page. I seriously think that shes halfway vacillating between being a role model and a hypocrite, thus piling her with so many other gutless celebrities out there today. Her new album reeks of this message - and when the tracks here are bad, they really make you wonder how such amateur productions even made it into the recording studio.<br />Granted 'American Life' debuted at No. 1, but considering that the musical landscape on the American charts these days is pitiably disposable, that isn't saying much. I specifically didn't like a few things about this album :<br />1) Madonna's fascination/slavery to/with Mirwais Ahmadzai continues on this record in shameless fashion. Mirwais had a fine run with 'Music' and his own album 'Production' but his limitations as a producer are so clear on this record. It makes you long for Madonna's work with William Orbit. Mirwais' obsession with looping Madonna's voice, violating it endlessly with a vocoder, and adding bird noises and chirping sounds continue through this record, a very dismal proposition indeed.<br />2) Madonna's lyrics were really going somewhere on her last two albums, but over here they take a turn for the worse. Her intended childish half-woman half-child act can only last so long, and when she skips through the melodramatic 'Mother and Father' with such inane lyrics as 'There was a time I had a mother. It was nice.', you know that theres something amiss. What I find most disgusting is that many naive young listeners actually find her idiotic rantings 'spiritual' and 'uplifting'. I am assuming that these are the same people who buy poetry books written by Jewel, and that would explain a whole lot.<br />3) The length of the album is another sore point. There are only eleven songs, two of which had been circulating around for a while, leaving us with just nine real tracks. Considering that about 75% of this record is indeed disposable, that leaves us with about three songs actually worth talking about. This is not a good sign.<br />4) Madonna's voice. I guess all the vocal lessons she took for 'Evita' are a thing of the past. Here she is back to her usual eighth grade warbling which may work very well for a Mandy Moore record, but here only serves to reinforce the wide-held belief that the lady hasn't got a voice. Upon repeated listening, it becomes clear that the intention of the record was to present a very stripped-down Madonna, so that words like 'raw' and 'natural' could be used in the blurbs. Sadly, her voice does her no favors, and when turkeys like 'X-Static Process' pop up, you're convinced that what you're listening to is a well oiled marketing machine.<br />5) It seems that Madonna is functioning under the woeful assumption that she is in some way related to Bjork. This becomes evident when 'Post' and 'Homogenic'-like nuances are introduced into the record. This may have worked on single tracks back in 1994 (Bjork co-wrote Madonna's 'Bedtime Story') but the wannabe syndrome continues with unabashed gluttony on this record, which I predict will further alienate fans of electronica and trance who will initially flock to this record based on the 'Ray of Light' and 'Music' experiences.<br />The only real 'song' here is a glorious ballad called 'Nothing Fails' for which Madonna's hired the London Choir. They lend the song whatever life it has, but on the way through the track it becomes clear that Madonnas ripped the musical interludes for the song from various sources, most notably Suzanne Vega's underrated 'Rosemary'.

I went out and bought the limited edition on the day of release, and was extremely put off by the minimal content of the edition, as well as the musical quality. Having placed 'Ray of Light' on my Top 10 list of all time classic albums, it is with a heavy heart that I must put aside 'American Life' as a pretty piece of fluff. All dressed up and nowhere to go, indeed. I suppose it will be remembered as a mis-step that turned out to be a classic (such as 1993's 'Erotica') eventually, but purely from a musical standpoint, I would much prefer listening to the Dixie Chicks, or even some of Mirwais' solo work. Clearly, his collaboration with Madonna has reached saturation point.<br />In closing, I must reiterate that 'American Life' is not an album to be tossed aside lightly. Rather, it is an album to be flung to the floor, full force.eems that Madonna is functioning under the woeful assumption that she is in some way related to Bjork. This becomes evident when 'Post' and 'Homogenic'-like nuances are introduced into the record. This may have worked on single tracks back in 1994 (Bjork co-wrote Madonna's 'Bedtime Story') but the wannabe syndrome continues with unabashed gluttony on this record, which I predict will further alienate fans of electronica and trance who will initially flock to this record based on the 'Ray of Light' and 'Music' experiences.<br />The only real 'song' here is a glorious ballad called 'Nothing Fails' for which Madonna's hired the London Choir. They lend the song whatever life it has, but on the way through the track it becomes clear that Madonnas ripped the musical interludes for the song from various sources, most notably Suzanne Vega's underrated 'Rosemary'.

B000089RVX|5.0|I think this is a great cd.  It combines a modern heavy sound with actual melodies!  Unique, huh?  In a world of bellowing, screaming, and boring monotone vocal melodies, this cd really shines.  The vocals are great, haunting yet not so ethereal that you wish she would just sing already.  Finally, a female vocalist that sings with power - not a succession of whines and hiccups. A wonderful variety of tunes, I was impressed.
B00008WT5J|5.0|The sound is excellent 6 stars and if you have a text reading cd player it tells you the name of the song that is playing and that is another excellent 6 stars.
1559408898|5.0|**Note:  This review deals with the \\"Criterion Collection\\" edition**<br />Still hailed as a sci-fi classic even today (and happens to be one of my personal favorites), \\"Robocop\\" is a marvelous and outstanding film.  This is one of the few movies I can watch over and over again and never get sick of it.  I may not be a big sci-fi buff, but that's one of the great things about this movie; you don't have to be one.<br />\\"Robocop\\" takes place in the future where Detroit is plagued with crime and murder.  Cops are threatening to go on strike while crime lords and gangs run amuck.  And when a police officer is brutally murdered by a relentless crime lord and his band of thugs, that's when corporation giant OCP resurrects him and transforms him into the ultimate crime-fighting machine.  In all of it's violent and dark glory, \\"Robocop\\" is a film that proves to be both a successful action thriller and a clever satire.<br />I love everything about this movie.  The story, the plot, the characters, everything!  This is one of the few movies that when I pop it in the DVD player and hear the music for the opening titles, I get chills.  It's like seeing it for the first time every time I watch it.  It's very well written and directed.  It also has some terrific acting.  (Who would've thought that the father from \\"That 70's Show\\" could prove to be a very effective villain?)  And for an older movie, it has some incredible special effects.<br />Be warned, this is not a movie for people who do not like excessively violent movies.  This one's as violent as they come.  Gun shot wounds, arms and heads getting blown off, people getting shot multiple times... you get the idea.  After all, this is Paul Verhoeven we're talking about (the very man behind \\"Total Recall,\\" and \\"Starship Troopers\\").  So be warned.<br />The version I have is the \\"Criterion Collection\\" edition.  It's a shame that this one is so hard to find, because I do think this is the best version out there.  Not only is it loaded with some very cool features, it's also the unrated director's cut that offers a few extra seconds of extra gore in two specific scenes.  (I think it's only two.)  Now, that's not a very big deal and doesn't really add much to the movie, but it is something at least.  And the picture and sound is great.  I am aware that the newer version is supposed to look a lot better than this one, but that DVD doesn't appear to have ANY special features on it.  So I will stick with this one until a better one comes out.  (I have a feeling that a better one will come out in the future.)<br />Some special features included on the Criterion version are storyboards, theatrical and teaser trailers, commentary, film-to-storyboard comparison, and more.  It would've been nice to have a few more extras, but it's not a bad package if you ask me.<br />\\"Robocop\\" will forever remain a classic in my eyes.  It's one of the few sci-fi flicks I can watch over and over again.  THIS is the one to see (while #2 wasn't too bad of a movie, the third one is a complete embarrassment).  If you want to see a great sci-fi movie with brains and action, this is the one to experience.<br />In the very wise words of Robocop himself, \\"Stay out of trouble.\\"ded with some very cool features, it's also the unrated director's cut that offers a few extra seconds of extra gore in two specific scenes.

B00006BTCA|5.0|for me, it is so hard to find a band that clicks with me and makes me come back for more. i find it the best to listen to when im falling asleep or just passing out from one to many &quot;beers&quot;. but the words and the sound put out a type of cosmic soothing rythem. its quick approch and melo sounds make this album worth listening to anywhere at any time with out any complaints.
0553212478|2.0|there is a certain degree of philosophy in this one. man is not good. our man is taking his experiments too far, wanting to make  a human, using body parts from dead people. it lives of course. it escapes. learns to read and write. decides to find its master. the conflict deepesn. although the plot is interesting, it is not carried out that well. the psychology is lost somewhere. i just don't buy it, because there is really nothing to buy. the &quot;monster&quot;'s role gets  abit unclear, and some of the philosphical elements are lost. it gets a bit stilted. the plot IS interesting, but it just isn't worked well. it all becomes kind of blurred. THIS IS NOT A HORROR NOVEL. it really is not, as stated by a true horror master: H.P.Lovecraft. it is a philosophical supernatural drama. if you want a horror novel, you are looking in the wrong direction. i agree there is something grizzly here, but that does not make horror.
B00000DHRZ|4.0|i love this album! there is only 1 song i don't like. that would be \\"Pay The Man.\\" It's perfect for letting all of the anger out! plus, if you pop it in the computer, there is a bonus. Videos & an offspring karaoke lounge! you even get to see a clip of one of the guys trying to steal some beer! :D
B000000Y2R|5.0|For a concert recording, the technical aspects of the music are amazing for 1953, and the CD goes a long way at bridging the gap to digital. You'll want crank this one up, with plenty of bass, to appreciate the brights of Dizzy, Charlie, Max Roach and Bob Powell, and the incredible Mingus bottom end. The all-star ensemble in sync and in peak form is an experience, trust me. In my opinion, no one artist overpowers, just complements each other. Fabulous!!
0156027321|5.0|This is a beguiling story made all the more compelling by its interwoven strands of adventure and spirituality. In the hands of a less vigilant author, Yann Martel's tale might quickly have spiralled downward into dud sentimentality and bogus fantasy. But there is something in the book which somehow rings a quiet bell in one's inner self, the way all great novels do. It is about a journey against the odds as fate throws Piscine Molitor Pate together with an odd band of fellow travellers, suggestive of the way we ourselves are cast adrift at birth on our own personal odysseys - though not normally with zoo animals as companions. On some pages, I was reminded of Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, a castaway who considers the universe while dealing with the mundane practicalities of staying alive. A gentle but stunning work.
B000065VA1|5.0|\\"Mindpop\\" - pop music which makes you think, with some brilliant lyrics and somehow very original but catchy music....<br />After experiments with electro-pop, prog rock and punk he made a wonderfull mixture of Soul,pop,etno and rock.<br />More than half of the songs from here became big hits and pop Classic.But all album is worth listening....<br />\\"RED RAIN\\" - haunting and moving but somehow very catchy.Still can be heard on the radio.... Gabriel singing here sounds really creepy - \\"...Red rain is falling down,falling down all over me...\\"<br />\\"SLEDGEHAMMER\\" - funky and most poppy track from here.Exploding chorus and nice backing vocals.Classic sentence - \\"I WANNA BE...YOUR SLEDGEHAMMER\\"<br />\\"DONT GIVE UP\\" - Breathtaking and moving duet with Kate Bush..........While peter tales a tale of a useless man who fails in his life, Kate is talking to him \\"DONT GIVE UP - yOUrE NOT THE OLY ONE..\\"<br />\\"THAT VOICE AGAIN\\" - paranoic Pop, in the same style as \\"I have the touch\\" but less darker.It is about neurotic man struggling for communication...Beside My favourite track from here!!!!<br />\\"MERCY STREET\\" - beautifull Ballad dedicated to Anne Sexton (Poet and photographer).Very calm and peacefull........relaxing but also unbelievable sad....<br />\\"BIG TIME\\" - Loud and hard Funk. About famous star who has got everything and wants more...never was my favourite, but i never hated it. just good.<br />\\"WE DO WHAT WE'RE TOLD\\" - Creepy and dark track.The choir is repeating \\"we do what we're told, told to do\\"....Scary and brilliant. <br />\\"THIS IS THE PICTURE (EXCELENT BIRDS) - Duet with Laurie Anderson.More alternative than pop, with some meloracitation.Another great one.<br />\\"IN YOUR EYES\\" - Warm love declaration, etno-flavoured.Another of his classic hits.And another of my favourites.<br />\\"SO\\" is one of his best albums and still sounds very fresh....ENJOY
B000002KGT|5.0|Often the passage of time diminishes the quality or aesthetics of a piece of art; the art (particularly music) becomes &quot;dated.&quot;  Many recordings from the Seventies--songs that were phenomenally popular--today come across as stale, corny, or contrived.<br />Anyone remember &quot;You Light Up My Life&quot;?<br />Such is not the case with Fleetwood Mac's masterpiece, RUMOURS.  The energy, emotion, passion, and musical mastery of this album is just as compelling today as it was in 1977.  On top of that, today's technology only makes listening to RUMOURS even more of a pleasurable and spellbinding experience.<br />For me, having been a college student when this album was released, each track from this troubled band is a wondrous trip down memory lane.  Among my favorites:  &quot;Dreams&quot;; &quot;Don't Stop&quot;; &quot;Silver Springs&quot;; &quot;You Make Loving Fun.&quot;  And &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot; is musical nirvana, a glimmering, golden rock 'n roll keeper.<br />The inner turmoil Fleetwood Mac was experiencing when RUMOURS began shattering the Billboard charts received as much publicity as the album itself.  Despite the band's dysfunction--or perhaps because of it--members Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks, Christine McVie, Mick Fleetwood, and John McVie were hitting on all musical/creative cylinders.  As a result, RUMOURS is timeless, ageless, and enthusiastically recommended.<br />--D. Mikels
B000000I0K|5.0|\\"Qe2\\" came out between the rocking \\"platinum\\" and more complex \\"Five miles out\\".it could be heard that he is searching for more natural sounds.there is only little left from clear and crispy production of \\"platinum\\" - the production is different and the whole album has a bit darker sound than other albums.<br />\\"Taurus I\\" is a real gem from here - a 10 minutes long complex track with a lot of celtic motives and great Vocoder tricks.Mike's guitar and synths are outstanding.<br />\\"qe2\\",\\"Sheba\\",\\"Wonderful land\\",\\"Arrival\\" and \\"Molly\\" are very positive and cheerful tracks.only \\"Mirage\\" and loud \\"Conflict\\" have that bit of Madness and darkness in them.<br />\\"QE2\\" is another great work from Mike Oldfield that should not dissapoint any of his fans.his mixture of distorted guitars,synths,celtic music and progressive rock didn't grew old up to now.a must have album!
B00005JKZV|5.0|This is the best movie of all fantasy titles! The story is not very true to the book of t he movie. But it does has very cool scenes, good acrting and spectacular battles. The ents were superior, Helms deep was awesome. A must watch.The tiny problem was that it didn't follow the book. But it makes up this flaw from the visual effects and quality of this movie. Watch it.
B00005JKPF|4.0|after the staggeringly good original, hopes were very high for X2. Thankfully we were not disapointed in the big budget brash sequel that follows on from the original. The perfect casting of the original,Hugh Jackman coming from nowhere to be the worlds best superhero - Wolverine, is again mainly the centre character of the story, who has went in seach of his previous life. Events spiral out of control when his journey leads him to the only man who seems to know about his previous life, General Stryker (Brian Cox)who has kidnapped Professer X (Patrick Stewart), whos cerebro could wipe out the mutant population. <br />Anything else? Remeember Boris from Goldeneye? hes back as Nightcrawler (aka Kurt wagner) and presents most of the humour. <br />Overall its a classy affair, with soom good special effects and story. Any gripes? Bad feeling at the end and Halle Berry Berry wasted as Storm.
0679746048|5.0|Ok I have read the previous reviews and I thought I would but my two cents in.  This book should be read by every young girl.  I should have read this book in high school.  Being a physics major in college I had to love the references in the opening chapter and the tittle Topology of an Unknown Universe.    I was a very smart, intelligent, high strung, low self esteem, and artistic young girl who never saw mental illness comming.  I am a boarderline personality.  It is one of the most misunderstood medical conditions ever.  Every high school student is taught about the dangers of drug use, eating disorders, and the like, but no one teaches you how to deal with your own mental limits and in pushing them pushing your own bounds of reality.  Reading this book was like staring in my soul.
B000089RVX|5.0|I have just purchased the new evanescence album and its the best album that i have heard for a while uve got tunes like bring me to life that is heavy rock which im really into then uve got a song like imaginary or hello which just give the album a bit of a twist i wouldnt of expected this from a first album but it's an album thats worth purchasing if ur a rocker.
B00008NRI8|2.0|Being a fan of both Miss. Sandra Bullock and Mr. Hugh Grant I looked forward to what I felt would be a fun movie, unfortunately I was to be quite disappointed.  <br />Miss Bullock's character lacked the manic energy she has frequently displayed and that this story badly needed.  Her character, Lucy Kelson, had a great deal of potential, which a lackluster performance did not deliver.<br />Mr. Grant's performance was better, but not markedly so.  The `one liners' he delivered had little punch and even less humor.  The chemistry between the two main characters, necessary in this type film, just didn't seem to be there.<br />The one bright spot was Miss. Alicia Witt, as June Carter, a sort of rival to Miss Bullock's character for the affections of Mr. Grant.  Her performance had energy, humor, the vulnerability of youth and at the same time the sense that she was potentially a predator manipulating the situation for personal gain.    <br />Bottom line: Even the best miss on occasion and this is one such occasion.
B00007JVBI|5.0|I had never heard of Cat Power until it was recommended to me by a friend, and I must say this is some of the most beautiful, stirring music I have ever heard in my life.  It's best to listen to alone, with headphones, in order to hear every nuance of the song.  I would recommend this to anyone and everyone.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|For those of you anxiously awaiting a new Mac CD, you won't be disappointed! This is their best body of work (so far). There is a maturity and depth to the songs; from Stevie's haunting 9-11 tribute 'Illume', and Lindsey's 'Murrow Turning Over In His Grave'. Stevie &amp; Lindsey's harmonies sound just as beautiful as they did on the Buckingham Nicks album (for those old enough to remember that one). What you won't find on this CD are any Christine McVie songs, although she does make an appearance on here. Don't worry; you won't miss her!
B00005JLET|5.0|Spirited Away is a very creative and imaginitive movie. It still has the basic story but the ending is a little depressing. Maybe that's just me saying that cause I cried at the end but you have to see it for yourself. Well like I said before it's a very creative movie for children who want science-fiction and action and suspence and romance all at once!
0684833395|4.0|Craig Leaman <BR>Catch-22<BR> Catch-22 shows many things that relate to isolation because the people I the book are always arguing with each other and never give anyone on the same squadron the right support they need.  But the funny thing is they get by because they know that they are going to have to live with each other for a while, which leads to a state of depression in the squadron.    <BR> <BR>But the only thing that Yossarian wants to do is get out of the military and go home.  Yossarian gets very angry with people because he doesn't want anyone bugging him because he is a man that likes to be alone and stay in his own world which is shown by isolation.  A sign of isolation shown on this book is when Yossarian always has some sort of problem with himself.  This is shown by isolation because he is a man that is very lonely and wants to get out the military.  Catch-22 makes Yossarian feel very depressed because the military always bumps up the missions needed to leave the base.  So Yossarian always goes off on his own because he knows that he will be there for a while.  <br />Another sign of isolationism is when all the people in the book become incoherent because they are unsure of what to do to make themselves get along with one another.  This is isolationism because they take it out on other people while making themselves feel bad about how they are going to live the rest of their lives and at the same time taking their problems out on other people.  <BR> I believe this book should be read because it offers a lot of action and humor.  The men in the squadron are always fighting with each other but somehow they always seem to pull it off and get along in the end.  It also offers a lot of drama because when Yossarian's roommate dies many people are effected by it and don't know how to deal with it.  But at time the book can be boring because it rambles on about describing when Clevenger says how Yossarain is crazy.  It goes on for about a page and a half.  That is the only boring part of the book.  All round I thought it was a book that offered a lot of information on what war life was like at that time.
0385720920|4.0|This is definately the funniest book I've read so far this year!
B00005JLEU|5.0|I have to start off saying that that my friend recomended this film to me and I went to the rental store to rent it, but to my surprise, it was all out, and would be rented out for 5 months!  I was shocked to think that a Disney film could bring so much attention to itself.  So I went and bought it.  I went home and watched it on my laptop and was comepletely blown away by it.  The visuals are so amusing and colorful,  there is nothing like it.  I am not a huge fan of anime or cartoons for that matter (except the rare watching of Cowboy Bebop on Cartoon Network :)  but this was very different.  On the other hand,  this is not really a film for screaming, bleeding, throwing-up kids (like me).  For example,  there is a smoking frog and a big scene of blood splattering all over the place, not to mention the \\"fruit\\" that made a character throw up.  I loved this movie.  Go rent it or something.  It is really good and inventive.  I wish I could put 10 [stars!!!]
B00006JKON|4.0|I really don't understand why this album gets as much flack as it does, but opinions WILL differ. Therefore, my differing opinion is that this is a wonderful album. It was originally slated to be a film, but funds did not allocate, and so all that remains is this, what seems to be a concept album, which in some ways it is, but others it is not. Aside from the silent dialouge between tracks, and the accordions that grace the tracks here and there, I find little conceptual continuity. <br /> This is, as well, one of the heaviest Jethro Tull album, although it also has one of Ian Anderson's most gorgeous tunes, &quot;Skating Away on the Thin Ice...&quot;. This, in fact, is a quite diverse recording, and those of you who have remarked on how IA and Tull were lacking in originality obviously have your heads buried in the sand (or elsewhere!). Very entertaining, wonderful and engaging lyrical matter (mostly fun, though), and orchestral arrangements are lovely as ever, it is, to say the least, an essential from the boys of JT. <br />By the way, when IA refers to kitties in &quot;Bungle&quot;, whose to say that he's making reference to the cats in your homes? He could be talking about wild cats, the large animals in the jungle. Y'know, there IS a tropical theme to the words....
0066214122|1.0|This plot was so far off the beaten path that not even the writing skills of Michael Crichton could make it work for me.  As a follow-on to novels like Jurassic Park and The Andromeda Strain this book was a huge disappointment with a plot as elusive as the nanobot cloud it attempts to captivate the reader with.  I would recommend waiting until it is available at the library; don't waste your money.
0141301155|4.0|Tasty, rich in humor and a lesson to be learned in every scene. This novel can teach people of all ages alot of helpful ways to go about life the right way. I am only 18 and I know this book is quite old but everyone I have talked too has told me they loved this book and the movie. After you start getting in this book you will start to realize it isnt your average humor book. This book takes you through twist and turns and your always wondering whats going to happen next. Most people really get into this book because it would be so amazing to really visit a place like that and experience everything they experienced. I hope you enjoy the book.
0385504209|3.0|I found the first half of the book extremely captivating due to its many twists and unusual subject matter. As a Catholic, I was intrigued rather than upset about the plot's hypothesis regarding the Holy Grail.  However, I believe the ending was far too predictable; a real disappointment based upon the intriguing and well conceived &quot;puzzles&quot; up to that point.  If you want to read a real page turner from beginning to end I would recommend &quot;The Eight&quot; by Katherine Neville.
0440237688|5.0|The Giver<BR>   This is a book that is colorfully written by Lois Lowry. This is a science fiction book that has a lot of ambition of what a perfect community would be like. I think that this one of the best books that I have read in a long time. <BR>    This science fiction book is focus around the main character (Jonas). Jonas a t Age 12 gets the privilege of the receiver of Memory. His teacher is an elderly man by the name of The Giver. The Giver is the Receiver of Memory before him. During his training he is given the memories of the past world. He alone knows what is to feel pain, fear, hunger, and many other emotions. When he se's his father do some thing of complete horror to him he decides that he can't stay in the community much longer.  So he runs away with the help of The Giver. <BR>   This book is one book that you could read over and over again. It is even easy enough for a 10 year old to read. But in the end this is a good book.
0553288105|4.0|'The Gods Themselves' can most accurately be described as three distinct novellas that are linked by a ingenious premise (the transfer of matter and energy between parallel universes) and several events. Taking place on different worlds, each section of the book features unique characters, divergent tones, and different themes; the structure of the book reflects the tenuous connections and detached existences of the parallel universes themselves. This trifocal approach almost necessarily results in loose ends, but the result is surprisingly effective.<br />The first section is nearly unadulterated satire. A persistent but not very intelligent scientist, Hallam, accidentally discovers an impossible isotope (plutonium-186), which appears on our planet when aliens in another universe place it here, and its instability proves to be a 'free' source of energy. When another physicist, Lamont, discovers a potential flaw that might endanger our universe, his actions are motivated as much as by revenge against Hallam (and by the desire to be proven right) as by any thought of saving humankind from destruction. Although the explanation of the relate scientific concepts is both witty and brilliant, their basis in reality is absolutely ludicrous--but Asimov knows it. Instead, he uses this premise to skewer the foibles and egoism of scientists he spent most of his life observing.<br />The second story enters the other universe and presents the bildungsroman of Dua, who is so different from her counterparts that she is an alien in her own world. While the first segment's spotlights scientists and science, the second section focuses on an exotic culture and society, and along the way Asimov comments on racism, conformism, and sexuality. Dua then accidentally discovers the link to our universe--but to say anything more would be to say too much.<br />The concluding section is a more conventional science fiction tale, involving an older (male) traveler from Earth who moves to a lunar colony and falls in love with one of the younger (female) natives. Again, Asimov creates two very appealing characters, who become involved in the multiversal intrigues and who, in this episode, carry them to a crescendo. Yet the ending seems a bit contrived, and this third storyline doesn't have the impact or the cleverness of the first two parts. But 'The Gods Themselves' isn't really written for its plot(s) or its ending(s). Instead, the book's strengths are the inventiveness of its structure, the relevance of its themes, and the charm of its characters--and by those standards it's an otherworldly success.r colony and falls in love with one of the younger (female) natives.

B000063DHL|5.0|This Cd is definitly one of my favorites. The songs stranger in a strangeland and wasted years are great. To me though the highlight of the album would have to be Alexzander the great. the rytthm of this song is just awsome. Also the song caught somewhere in time is also an excellent peice of music. All around this cd is a five star peice of art. Yeah you listen to like number of the beast, or peice of mind. Which yeah they do sound a lot harder, although on this album they used synths, they are still rockin... On this album you can really tell the band has chemistry, there Drummer Nicko is fantastic(as usuall) and so are the rest of the band. But Nicko's skills really stand out I think on the song stranger in a strangeland. This cd is essental to a true hard rockers collection, and deffintly an essental to a maiden fans collection. Up the Irons!
