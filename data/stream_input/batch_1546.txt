B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Words can not really exspress how good this book was. It made me cry and laugh at times. The story seemed so true that it riggered emotions. I wish more authors would write tar jerkers like this one. Besides &#34;Will Grayson, Will Grayson&#34; this is one of Green`s best works.
B004JN1D2I|3.0|No need to review the books themselves, Martin's writing is amazing. But pages are missing. I contacted amazon 's customer service and they looked into it. They said they will fix the problem and provide an update to install the missing pages. So if u downloaded this and pages are missing, give them a call! Amazon's customer service has consistently been rated as one of the best, use it!

B0079XNWQA|5.0|I have almost all of Jason Mraz's music. And I must say I'm impressed at the way he reinvents himself while still keeping his \\"Mrazness\\" intact. I have been listening to the songs on repeat for days and still haven't had enough. I am wowed at the depth of emotions that he can convey with lyrics + simple melody. Insanely talented he is, yet there are no gimmicks to show off his musical prowess. The music just seems to flow from him naturally. Listening to him just renews my faith in the power of music and elevates my mood.<br />The second version of \\"I won't give up\\" with the additional verse is such a treat.<br />I am proud and lucky to be his fan. Can't wait for his concert in Sept.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun...a bunch of fun little games to keep you entertain...fun for adults or kids. recommend to download. don't read those other bad reviews.

B004LOMB2Q|2.0|Device: Kindle Fire<br /><br />I love the app Evernote  itself. It is one of the easiest amd best taking note apps you can get. Except for one thing- I discovered this app has viruses. When I ran a full scan of &quot;Dr. Web Anti-Virus Lite&quot;, it showed that Evernote had a virus
B008M34INW|5.0|This flick is just plain fun. Mel Gibson is incredible. This movie has non-stop action, drama, a little romance and one of the best shoot out scenes I've seen in ages. This is not a Hollywood movie with everything in a set perfectly placed. It's a movie inside a Mexican Prison where everything's all screwed up. It's dirty, there's drugs and plots to kill I don't know how many people. I LOVED this movie. Set aside Mels personal and very public screw ups and just watch this movie, you'll love him all over again. This will be one of my personal favorites.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very convenient and I really love that youversion sends periodic reminders encouraging me to spend time in the Word. It does make a world of difference in my day.
B000IOM1Y6|2.0|I love the early Alan Parsons Project albums, so I bought \\"Eye in the Sky\\" based upon others' reviews stating that it was the best or most popular of all Parsons' releases.  In my opinion it had one good song but overall the album/cd had no heart.  I have no desire to listen to it again.  If I keep it, I feel that it will be like my copy of \\"Try Anything Once\\" which I've listened to maybe five times in as many years of possession.
034580404X|3.0|A book you positively cannot put down! Definitely not for the faint-hearted.  Lead character is shockingly naive. Another is quite disturbed.
B007OWG3LM|5.0|I'm a neophyte when it comes to Sigur Ros.  I had no idea who or what they were.  I came to them by a circuitous route, having heard a song by Jonsi on the soundtrack How to Train Your Dragon (Sticks & Stones).  From that point, I began to collect their work song by song, burning them onto CDs to suit my own mad idea of continuity.  (I felt it didn't matter, as I couldn't understand nary a word anyway.)  I just loved their sound.  It's very ethereal and evocative; I haven't heard anything like it.<br /><br />I had no expectations or preconceived notions about what their latest offering should sound like.  I simply trusted that I would like it based on their past work and I was not disappointed.  It is a great addition to my collection.  I'm glad I bought it.
B00701L5XS|5.0|Fantastic App. Very Useful!<br />The different views and animations can't be beat!<br />If you want to learn how to tie knots... This is the app for you! I love it!
B005LAII0I|2.0|Someone starts a trend (movies and TV shows based on fairy tales) and soon everyone has to get into the act.  At this point, I don't think anyone can argue that there is a glut of fairy tale projects.  I already had my fill when this one came along.  The nicest thing I can say about this film is that it is exceedingly beautiful.  They definitely paid a pretty price to make it so lovely.  The darn thing practically blinds it's that sparkly.  Unfortunately, you can only stare at a bauble for just so long before boredom overtakes and attention begins to lag.  Bedazzled or not, I blame the writers for making such an ageless story so dimwitted.  (For a second there I fully expected Rocky and Bullwinkle to show up, surely this was a lost episode of Fractured Fairy Tales!)  To suggest their spin was a tad dopey doesn't give them nearly credit enough.  The dialog was in turns coy then juvenile.  They needed much more than pretty props to pull this off.  Slapping Julia Roberts into the feature was simply not enough (a meaner person might say she was more of a hindrance than any help).  They needed fully realized characters, people you could care about.  Instead, everything bright and beautiful showed up and nothing with depth or soul.  Too rich for my taste.
B007LNJ4YW|4.0|Some (previously myself included) had dismissively branded this band pleasantly retro. Not anymore. Teen Dream was tagged as the real game changer for Beach House, their billing went from mildly accliamed band to Dream Pop behemoths with that record and although i listened and enjoyed, i wasn't totally convinced they'd really made such a huge leap forward. In retrospect, i may have been to quick to judge as Bloom didn't immediately bawl me over either. However, their were particular songs that i really couldn't stop singing from the album so i found myself returning to it almost subconciously, until one day i realised i was singing virtually every song on here (much to the chagrin of my neighbours). The beauty of the music on Bloom seems patently obvious to me now and i can't quite realise why i didn't love it immediately.<br /><br />Myth and Lazuli are two songs that have been used as bait to reel in potential newcomers with free streams available of them before the albums official release. And it's hard to query their logic, their both stunners featuring glistening keyboards, impassioned singing courtesy of Victoria Legrand and that familarly distinctive sound of Alex Scully's Fender Stratocaster. In all honesty though i could have just described any of the songs on Bloom as they all feature similar instruments give or take some scintillating percussion. what seperates these wonders is the plethora of inspired melodies each track has to offer combined with the heartfelt and thought provoking lyricism that's also brought to the fore. \\"What comes after this momentary bliss, the consequence of what you do to me\\" almost sliced my heart in half when Victoria Legrand romantically bellows this on Myth. And the melodies oh the melodies their the most tender i've heard since Yo La Tengo's gorgeous And Then Nothing Turned Itself Out.<br /><br />The revolving riff on \\"Irene\\" from 3.30 on follwed by the flurry of cymbal crashes is so transcendentally stunning you'll wish thesong goes on for a lot longer then it's 17 minute length (or that they'd filled the silence in between at least). The moaning MY bloody Valentine guitars in \\"New Year\\" always get me to, their filled with such nostalgic melancholy. I could go on descirbing the celestial music on Bloom if you wish, but i'm reluctant to spoil any more wonderful suprises you'll have in store if you're yet to hear this. Some immediately hailed Bloom the album of the year upon it's release in April and of course it was far too early to say at that point. However where now nearing the end of july and i'm struggling to name the album that's definitely topped this yet, lets see what Grizzly Bear and Animal Collective have to offer this fall ;)
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Love it! Fun game! Great time waster! Makes me think of my friend Tammy! Awesome! I am not digging, tho, the fact that I have to enter twenty words just to submit this rating...
B004MC8CA2|5.0|everyone needs this to complete there life or atleast a Bible its awesome 5 stars its so good worth the download
B001DE29SS|5.0|Today we know Robert Downey Jr for playing Tony Stark in the \\"Iron Man\\" movies or Sherlock Holmes in the new action blockbuster franchise but before all that he had a subdued yet close to brilliant portrayal as the legendary Charlie Chaplin, who was in his day bigger and more popular than most of our current A list actors and actresses. Some say Chaplin was the first actor to open up the world market and the isolating affect it had on him is explored in this film. Incidentally, Chaplin was considered the most famous film star worldwide during World War I.<br /><br />This 1992 film explores Chaplin's rise to stardom going from acting troupes to taking a job in America in silent films and his gradual control over later films (some not so popular at the time like \\"The Great Dictator\\"), as well as his turbulent romances/marriages (especially the ugly and controversial paternity lawsuit a la Joan Barry) to finally finding the right one. We also get a look into his many pictorial roles, his co-founding of United Artists as well as how McCarthyism ended up fracturing his career and having him move to Switzerland for the next several decades.<br /><br />There's a nice finale to Chaplin's life in which he returns to the 1972 Academy Awards to receive a special award and discovers that even though Hollywood has changed greatly it never forgot him. One of the last of the clips to be shown is a kid being taken away from his father in which Chaplin is arguably demonstrating the fantasy of what he wished for when he was a child. That was a nice wraparound to one of the matters which haunted Chaplin's past . . . being an orphan and abandoned by his parents. I believe the actual picture was the 1921 \\"The Kid\\".<br /><br />Downey's acting got him a nomination for Best Actor by the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards but BAFTA gave him the actual award for Best Actor. The film was nominated by those three for other awards (too many to list, really). Note that one of Chaplin's daughters, Geraldine Chaplin, played the role of Charlie Chaplin's \\"going insane\\" mother in the movie.<br /><br />A number of other actors and actresses played various roles, including Dan Akroyd (Hollywood producer Mack Sennett), Moira Kelly (two roles: Chaplin's first serious love interest and then his final wife), Diane Lane (Chaplin's third wife and actress, Paulette Goddard), Milla Jovovich (another actress wife to Chaplin), Anthony Hopkins (as Chaplin's later editor for his autobiography), Penelope Ann Miller (Hollywood actress), Marisa Tomei (another Hollywood actress), Kevin Kline (as Chaplin's friend, Dougla Fairbanks, not to be confused with Douglas Fairbanks Jr, his son), James Woods and David Duchovny (Chaplin's cameraman). For director fans Richard Attenborough directed this piece.<br /><br />Some spoilers below as to liberties taken with Chaplin's life.<br /><br />CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: A minus; STORY/PLOTTING: B plus; GETS CHAPLIN RIGHT: B plus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: A minus; WHEN WATCHED: April 2012;  OVERALL GRADE:  B plus to A minus.<br /><br />SPOILERS: the paternity suit with Chaplin a la Joan Barry is still debated. Some say Chaplin paid off corrupt officials to tell the court the child was not his but in the movie Chaplin is shown to be innocent and pays for the child support anyway.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|As soon as \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" begins, you're practically guaranteed to have goosebumps. The opening scene is hair-raising; it's exciting, it's blood-pumping, it gives you an idea of what to expect over the next two hours and forty four minutes. You're practically tossed around, choked out, and physically manhandled by Bane nearly every moment he's on-screen. No, he's not as big as he was in the comics but he's still pretty freaking big. Tom Hardy is sensational. His eyes are so expressive, angry, and cold. Even though his actions will probably be the first thing you remember about the character, his eyes will practically haunt you during his performance.<br /><br />The entire cast is really phenomenal though. Christian Bale is still a solid Bruce Wayne/Batman, but it certainly seems as though he's more of a foundation for the rest of the cast to be greater than he is. Anne Hathaway is mesmerizing as Selina Kyle. Her being cast in the role seemed a bit underwhelming at first, but she surprises you. She makes the Catwoman character her own; she's intelligent, sexy, always has something quick-witted to say, and you figure out just enough about her to want her to be around more often than she is.<br /><br />The direction the Alfred character goes in is really interesting. He just wants what's best for Bruce, but does something that is easily the most difficult decision of his entire life. Michael Caine is extraordinary. He plays the father figure so perfectly. Gary Oldman shines, as well. Oldman is pretty great in every role he has anyway, but this is the first time in one of the Batman films where he's had to defend his actions. Oldman is so absorbing and enticing whenever he loses his cool or gets angry in a film. Newcomer Joseph Gordon-Levitt also deserves some recognition. Constantly called a hothead by his superior, Jim Gordon takes him under his wing. The John Blake character is so passionate about what he thinks is right and what he thinks Batman should be doing and Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a fantastic job portraying that.<br /><br />Hans Zimmer's soundtrack for the film is easily one of the best this year has had to offer. There's enough familiarity in the soundtrack to trigger nostalgic moments from the two previous films, but it adds something raw and visceral during the chants and during anything that plays in the background when Bane is on screen. A song like \\"The Fire Rises\\" is haunting in a way and the music is so sharp; it cuts to your very bones. Pounding drums, horns that seem to bide their time and start low and then scream when you least expect it, and strings played so vigorously that you expect to hear them snap and break at some point. Meanwhile, the slower songs like \\"Mind If I Cut In\\" rely on something like a simple piano arrangement but also seem kind of playful at the same time to adhere to Selina Kyle.<br /><br />There are certain things in \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" that make it really solid and one of the best third installments of any franchise, if not the best; the main one being the last twenty minutes or so. The conclusion is spectacular and it seems like Christopher Nolan built this entire near-three-hour spectacle around these key moments. It is near perfect and satisfying in almost every way.<br /><br />The other thing is how Nolan was able to bring so much back from not only \\"The Dark Knight,\\" but also \\"Batman Begins\\" and makes this feel that much more conclusive. Characters you remember are mentioned, Bruce's childhood is brought up on more than one occasion, and the whole movie is just littered with references and throwbacks to what this franchise has already accomplished. It feels like everything comes full circle and that this chapter of Batman is indeed over.<br /><br />Everything in between the jaw-dropping opening and the amazing conclusion feels so familiar though. There are new characters while old ones are taken down new paths and the destruction being done to Gotham is on the biggest scale this universe has ever seen, but if it wasn't for the well-written screenplay it would feel a bit repetitive. As you play the movie over in your head after it ends (and you will, more than once), you begin to see things and wonder why they weren't expanded on.<br /><br />One of them being that Selina Kyle is terrified of Bane. She's obviously familiar with what he's done in the past or had some sort of run-in with him. Their past is never really fully explained and the two characters don't really have any screen time together. Then there's the obvious nitpick of not being fully able to understand Bane at all times. It'll just give you an excuse to see it again, honestly.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" is final in the best of ways. It is overflowing with explosive action, features passionate performances from every part of the cast, and is just completely and totally engrossing from beginning to end. Some are calling it a masterpiece, but it doesn't quite reach that status. \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" is really quite good and even great at times, but doesn't obtain the same level of brilliance its predecessor did.est scale this universe has ever seen, but if it wasn't for the well-written screenplay it would feel a bit repetitive.

B004DLPXAO|1.0|I don't normally leave bad reviews, but this one really deserves it. After update could not get any of my books. FIX IT or return to the previous system. Need to do something asap before the reputation of kindle gets terrible.
B008MEM24S|1.0|I don't know why... but it wont freaking download for my kindle fire!!!! fix it fast. I'm getting frustrated!!  waist of money... :/
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a very nice basic calculator.  The number keys are large and easy to use.  I like using it to balance my checkbook and add bills.  And it was free to boot!  Thanks!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Ive played this game so much and restarted it multiple times!!! I love to play it and let my friends try!!! and om nom is soooooo cute!!!
B007VDN1PA|5.0|I bought this item because I had another type of scanner that I was working with and it died!  So I went on Amazon and read about this and decided that it would work to finish what I wanted to do.  I tried it and was very very happy with the way it worked.  It took my slides and brightened them so I would have a very good picture when I printed them.  My other scanner did not do that so my other pictures were darker than I would have liked.  It is very easy to use and I was very excited to be able to use my SD card to save my images and then put them on the computer. My other scanner would only let me do 12 at a time and then put them on the computer as it did not use an SD Card.  I love this product!  It is just what I wanted and More! I am scanning about 2,000 slides and then putting them on the computer and from there will get pictures made.  I am so glad I went to Amazon instead of going to a store.  I am getting my project done much faster and the quality of the pictures is going to be great!  Thank you Amazon!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This game is fun and frustatingly addictive.  The hint button teases you when having trouble coming up with another combo.  Some combinations. Are fun and surprising.  Over all a great pa ss time when sitting in waiting rooms.  Or when you need to tune the created world out.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|The dvd arrived promptly and in perfect contidion; playing quality is exceptional.. I like this movie more than the first Sherlock film.  Greatly entertaining!!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I may be a little old for kids games but this is fun. I would like it better if it didn't have to be rebooted sometimes. I might have bought it if it wasn't free. it's that much fun.
0743437497|3.0|This book is good, but long-winded. I didn't find it scary in the least. I thought Apt Pupil was creepy as hell, but The Shining just didn't give me the chills. Topiary animals aren't scary to me. But - the most glaring thing in the book is the mention of caribou in Colorado. Caribou don't live south of the Arctic Circle. How did King and his editors allow this error to make it to print? Another thing that I see as a common theme in King's works - the children are always way too advanced for their age. I think Danny should have been at least a couple years older than five. And Jack Sawyer in the Talisman should have been older than twelve. Just my opinion.

B004EYT932|1.0|This book was not at all what I expected from the review of it that I read in the newspaper. I'm a lover of history, and I like putting 20th century events into context, but this book was so overloaded with data and contained little historical context, and the charts were much too small and faint to read.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|very convenient also does trig functions. large numbers are easy to see making the calculator a breeze to use. yay
B005S39YGU|5.0|Excellent first season - love the Big Bang Theory for their originality and witty script.  Love Sheldon Cooper and his group of friends!
0393338827|5.0|I had this book sitting in my library for a few months and didn't get to it until after i read Boomerang, which i also highly recommend. As someone who thought i had followed financial news during the last few years in a fairly comprehensive manner, the amazing story about the subprime casino type scandal that nearly brought down the world's financial system (and that still may accomplish same) is a truly eye opening tale. I guarantee that you'll never see the sanctimonious and arrogant self proclaimed financial experts on CNBC, Bloomberg, or in print journalism, in the same light again. I think that this book along with Black Swan, teach you all you need to know about protecting your assets.... in other words, you really don't have a clue about what may come along, but all the \\"experts\\" you listen to don't have much more of a clue then you do. Recent events such as MF Global and Peregrine also remind you that you can't believe anyone anymore or assume that any institution is telling you the truth about what they are doing with your money. What's the answer? about the closest i can come is to strictly stick to hands-on hard assets that you can control and monitor constantly, and be ready to switch strategies quickly when markets tank or change. Sorry, didn't mean to make this an investment commentary. i highly recommend this book as a must read for anyone with any assets to protect.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was skeptical and nervous about reading this book, I had heard it was really sexy and sexual, and yes it was but I could not put this book down. The author eases you into the story in such an innocent way, just as innocent as is the main character...AWESOME that is this story...reading Book #2 now, very different than #1, wondering where #3 takes me, bought it already! My kindle is in constant use...
B00881VLCE|4.0|overall good and i like the shapes not just cut into squares.  makes for a good mind challenge but it's not frustrating.
B007AJFSJW|5.0|Easy read, but still presenting a coherent set of arguments and giving a lot of food for thought. Highly recommended.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|What a great little machine this DB-Tech 35mm Film Slide/Negative Scanner is! My husband and I have hundreds of old slides we want to save in digital form, and when we began exploring saw several types of scanners and chose this one from Amazon. To say the least, we are not tech savy and although we CAN read, we had trouble figuring out USB cables, buttons, and arrows that young whippersnappers might know right away. I emailed DB-Tech and Sam responded by giving us his phone # and eventually leading us through the set-up step by step! What a nice young Tech Rep. who was very polite AND patient. We would definitely recommend this scanner, and especially to older people (who I'm sure exist out there) with hundreds of slides that they used to bore company with and would like to again!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a good game. need to earn a lot of points to get more games tho.its a great challenge. I love it
0307744434|5.0|If you enjoyed this book you'd definitely enjoy the original book from which this appears to be an almost verbatim copy: Separated At Earth, The Story Of The Psychic Twins. (Published in 2007)
B0086700CM|5.0|I really like this game, it works amazing on my kindle fire. no glitches at all. yup amazing<br />from Elizah
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I loved the first two books. This book was a great story in its self, but I think the story could have ended in the second book. It seemed like they just wanted to make a third book. Maybe it is because I am not a huge book reader, but i think two was enough.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Great read really tugs at the heart strings once you start reading you never want to put it down. Really makes you think how easy things can change
B003O86FMW|5.0|All I can say is i was done with this book in 3 days. I am not a huge reader but this book went with me everywhere for 3 days. I was up til all hours wanting to know what was going to happen next. It is a great complement to the first book. Will read again!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a great game. It is awesome because it has a lot of different games that you can play that way you don't get bored.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Great game everyone should play. It's fun, challenging, and quick to advance to the next rounds.  If you love matching games. You have to give this one a try.
B002ZG980U|5.0|I love that this movie sets up it's own reality and dangerous and then immediately proceeds to put the character in situations where those dangers are exposed.  It's like learning a language during a conversation.  It should fall flat but somehow it works.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Amazon is great. The book is great.i will continue to make purchases with them. Looking forward th purchase my next book fifty shades 3.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Though I picked up the first season of Castle on an impulse buy while birthday shopping for someone else, I could not wait for the second and third seasons to arrive at my doorstep. Through the long and arduous two week wait for funds (traded in an old physics text book) and shipping (free, the best kind!), I worried that the second season wouldn't live up to my expectations, like a favorite book series you wait months for only to be disappointed in the end. Fortunately, Castle and Beckett did not disappoint!<br /><br />The show is just as witty and humorous as always, creating a fabulous mix with the macabre. It gets you thinking from the moment you see the body to whether your bets with your mom on the whodunit were right. A lot more character developing with Castle and Beckett (and even Esposito), and it keeps you on the edge of your seat from episode one to what should have been the two-part season finale, to what ACTUALLY was the season finale. Altogether, I had no regret in purchasing the show.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love the all the ice age movies so of course I love the game.  has all of the characters and plenty of goals to keep it interesting.
B00782O7NE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed The Artist when I first saw it, and I hoped to replicate the experience many times after buying this American release of the movie. As opposed to many of the international releases this one comes with a stunning reflective slip cover which I thought would look great in my collection. I was very disappointed however when I discovered that despite Amazon's listed information, as well as the actual back cover of the Blu-ray, THIS RELEASE IS NOT REGION FREE. While it may say regions ABC, it is in fact locked to region A. I have contacted Sony regarding this because I found it highly misleading, and I'm writing this review to deter other international buyers from making the same mistake I did.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Great variation on Wheres My Water. Helps to know the cartoon.  Well worth a buck!  You'll like it as much as your kids will.
B008MEM24S|5.0|it is the best.  my son loves Perry and already finished where's my water ...and swampy...so this was totally worth the dollar!
1613820895|5.0|Despite the obvious differences between Chesterton's Roman Catholic sentiments and Protestant theology, every confessional Protestant needs to read and interact with this classic, and will be heavily rewarded as a result.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|This novel is the kind of damaging trash that fools young women into thinking that good looks, prestige and money are the important attributes in a man.  Real love with a real man is nothing like this silly fiction portrays.  And no, I'm not narrow minded, just concerned for real young women.
B00701L5XS|1.0|I don't even know when you would need to use all those different knots this app is totally useless and stupid don't get it
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is the best basic calculator app I have seen and used.Since it is the full size of the Kindle Fire screen,  everything is easy to read. ++ to the app developer, Digitalchemy.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I avoided this app for a while because it looks stupid but it is very fun and addicting... easy at first then gets harder
B0078XGEK2|5.0|the first half of the book is psychological (giving advices how to live the life). Is very understandable language so you dont need any psychological background. The second half turns to philosophy and I consider this part even better. Anybody following his recomandations should be able to understand and enjoy the life much better
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I just finished reading it, and yes, it was painfully slow in the beginning, but like a train wreck, I couldn't stop reading, and have shamefully ordered the second one. Usually if a book doesn't catch me in the first couple of chapters, I press cancel and head to the next one I have downloaded. But this book, I just couldn't stop reading to see how far they were going to go. And some of the language, I had to consult my dictionary to find out their meaning. On a scale of 1 - 5, I'll give it a four. Now I need to get back to real reading - my Creative Writing course. :)
B005EM8O8O|4.0|Fear plays a role in evolution. Most chapters of this financial sci-fi thriller are prefaced by a quote from Darwin or Dawkins. Other quotes are from IT gurus.<br />Fear in this story appears in multiple shape, such as fear of a stock crash, fear of debtor default. And much more.<br /><br />The main character is a superrich 'financial engineer'. He is very successful with an investment algorithm based on fear symptoms in the public. He is obsessed with developing an artificial intelligence with learning abilities. He prefers the term AMR (autonomous machine reasoning) over AI.<br /><br />We are in Geneva, the city where Sissi died and where the Higgs boson was found. On the evening of the start of the novel, the hero wonders who sent him the first edition of a Darwin book  (Expression of emotion in man and animal) with a marker in a page illustrating fear in humans.<br /><br />That same night, the man surprises a burglar in his  villa and gets whacked on the head with a fire extinguisher. The brain scan shows some unclear spots which need to be further investigated to remove uncertainty. Is it  a pre-existing condition?<br />After just a few chapters, we have seen fear in all shapes. We have gone through the physical fear of the burglar, the fear of an injury, the fear of a prior brain condition. The fear of losing his wife, of his marriage breaking up. When our man looks out of his car and believes he saw the burglar looking out of a tram, he fears he has gone mad.<br /><br />The suspense is based on uncertainty about the nature of the problem. We do not understand what is happening for some time. Is it a conspiracy? Or a case of plain fraud and whodunnit? Or identity theft for other reasons? Or is our genius a nut case?<br />Unfortunately, Harris does not succeed in keeping up the suspense till the end. Somewhere after four fifth he loses steam, at the time when the pure action heats up. Maybe unavoidable with this plot.<br /><br />Harris has written some excellent thrillers (most recent one was The Ghost, filmed by Polanski) and some good novels about ancient Rome, mainly about Cicero. He is worth following. This novel here is interesting but ultimately not entirely satisfying.t thrillers (most recent one was The Ghost, filmed by Polanski) and some good novels about ancient Rome, mainly about Cicero.

B006LSZECO|5.0|I see there are so many other reviews of this engrossing book that I need not go into details.  I will just add a few comments of my own. I'm not usually a reader of mystery novels but I somehow stumbled into this one and I have to admit it is brilliantly done.  I thought it started off slowly since I was in a hurry to find out what happened to the missing wife but then it gradually picked up speed and intensity. I won't give any spoiler alerts but the plotlines are simply amazing.  And I was miserable at how it ended - I would like to rewrite that!  It requires some suspension of belief as they say.  But I have to admit that the ending was brilliant - completely fits in with the characters.  Yuck.  Read it - you won't be able to put it down. And details will haunt you for a long time.  Brilliant writing.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|My bookclub chose this book because of all the press about.  I had to force my way through it.  Poor writing, terrible dialog and unsexy sex scenes.  Yuck.  On top of that, it ends in a cliff hanger.  I'd rather jump off that cliff than read the next book.
B00004Z4SD|4.0|PRICE WAS RIGHT  -- SHIPMENT WAS FINE  - ACTUAL STORY WAS GREAT  IT STARTED IN A TOWN IN IOWA THAT IS A PART OF OUR FAMILY HISTORY!!!
0374275637|5.0|This is a long book jammed with very interesting nuggets about our brains, how we make decisions and how to deal with some of the subtlest of influences on decision-making.  Occasionally it sounded like Kahneman was appealing to our cognitive coherence rather that pointing to specific scientific research.  An example of this is the notion of how we deal with being surprised by unusual events and he tells a personal story in Chapter 6 as the evidence.  The story rings true, but I prefer the scientific approach and experiments that demonstrate the findings.  Most of the book does exactly that, pointing to scientific studies that demonstrate the conclusion.  I recommend the book.<br />Note: In Chapter 35 Kahneman goes into a great explanation of the Peak/End rule which is used in my book The Peak Interview.  This research formed the basis for his more recent work on the 'experiencing and remembering selves'.  Good book!
B0064NTZJO|5.0|My husband is a huge fan on director Nicalous Winding Refn, and being so he watches \\"Drive\\" frequently. I can appreciate the strong romanti aspect of the film. The violence often has me cringing, but the visual style of the film takes my breath away and I forget about how violent the film is. And.. Ryan Gosling, well enough for any woman to wanna see the film.
B0087DFIYA|5.0|A gritty action packed crime caper with several plot twists along the way. Sort of like a Mexican Guy Ritchie flick with some vintage Sam Peckinpah spaghetti western style action mixed in for good measure. If you are a Tarantino or Coen brothers fan (think \\"No Country for Old Men\\") or happen to like prison break tales like \\"Midnight Express\\" then this film is for you!
1592332803|5.0|When my son was 1 yr old, he was diagnosed with allergies to cow milk and eggs.  As an enthusiastic (though simple) home baker, I was devastated!  What would I bake for him that he could eat??  This book helped me learn about baking without cow butter or eggs, how to make substitutions in my favorite recipes, and gave me some new favorites to try.  We were not a vegan family, but were enormously helped through a difficult and overwhelming time by this book.<br /><br />Four years later, I just got an email from my husband's coworker, begging for the recipe to the chocolate cake that he tasted when my husband brought leftover cake to share at work!  It's so good.  I also like, off the top of my head, the pretzel, fruit tart, brownies, and chocolate sauce recipes.<br /><br />I recently switched to a plant-based diet (not strictly vegan, but really close), and have enjoyed Ms. Patrick-Goudrea's podcasts, Vegetarian Food for Thought, through that process.  She's got great, accessible recipes and is whip smart, to boot.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|I like this book now that I'm 3 weeks done with it.  It stays with you.  There's not much of a plot but the main characters are well fleshed-out. I still can't understand the parents' motivation, though.  Weird.  I can see the Canadian town.  It could make an interesting indie movie.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I throughly loved this trilogy. People at work were talking about it, and I wondered what the fuss was all about. Once you start reading you don't want to put it down. I can't wait for the 2 other movies. Make sure you read the first 2 books.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is fun and gets more difficult as you go on. Not fit for under 5 or the elderly. It is mind bogeling and stratigic and will definetly improve you IQ score.

B006WC7TFO|1.0|I couldn't even make it past the first 25 pages. I normally force myself to read on but I couldn't do it here .... spend your money on another book.
B007C3TVNA|3.0|The film is told in juxtaposing flashbacks with Kevin as a teen (Ezra Miller) and a child (Jasper Newell). It centers around his mother Eva (Tilda Swinton) whose life has gone from having fun in Paris to a living hell. We know Kevin ends up in jail over some haunting event which has caused everyone to hate Eva. The film shows us injured people, a little girl with an eye patch, a man in a wheel chair and we think &#34;Kevin?&#34; The film also likes to use the color red.<br /><br />It is a mystery in which everyone knows what has happened except the audience. Kevin is smart, mean, and cynical. He seems to represent a generation raised on too much TV and computers, although we don't see him over indulging in either.<br /><br />Tilda Swinton gives us a great performance in a script that is disjointed by design to give us a specific feel. If you like a film that is designed to make you feel drained after watching it, this is it.<br /><br />PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bomb, sex, brief nudity.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is the first book I've read by this author and I enjoyed it! Good writing, very intense .. keeps you wanting to know what happens next. Her characters are all sorts of crazy in the head, but that definitely adds to how good this book is. She is pretty vulgar - doesn't bother me - but if you are easily embarrased, you might blush. Wasn't too thrilled with the ending ... did expect a little more after all that happened throughout the previous 350+ pages. Absolutely recommended though!
B00782O7IY|4.0|This is a good movie, but it typically one that is overrated because it shows some kind of class, intellect and refinement to proclaim itself as genius. The production starts with 3 strikes against it. First, at times, it is a movie within a movie. Second, it is in black and white, and third, it is mostly all silent. With all the rave, I was willing to attempt an open mind viewing (zombie films are sometimes in black and white too).<br /><br />These techniques were done to to give us the flavor of the films of the era. Even though those restored masters are available, who among the 5 star rave reviewers watch them? You could list them on one hand, or maybe one finger. In the silent era, the jokes were visual. The sound track created the mood, more so than it does today, and actors had to make dramatic movements to create emotions. They used their face...a term called \\"mugging\\" in the film. This was brilliantly brought out in the film, although we already knew that.<br /><br />The film uses symbolism, such as when our star George Valentin's (Jean Dujardin)career is sinking, it shows him in a film sinking in quicksand. Good yes. Genius? Hardly. The script reminded me of \\"A Star is Born\\" (pick one) where a star launches the career of a new star only to see his fade. George is \\"The Artist\\" who believes talkies are not art. Besides the studio no longer wants George. They want fresh faces such as rising star Peppy Miller (B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Bejo).<br /><br />I liked the idea of doing the silent movie film to show us the transition from silent to talkies, I just didn't like the predictable script. Plot is important.<br /><br />No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. You should be able to read lips after this film.
B0081KTI0E|4.0|So many times I am disappointed with scary movies...mostly because they tend not to be scary.  Not this one.  I jumped several times (and so did my husband).  Main character acting is not that great - he should just stick to Harry Potter, but other than that I would highly recommend if you like thrillers.
B0086700CM|5.0|I just lost my phone and I was addicted to &quot;Temple Run&quot; and now it's an app for Kindle Fire!! I'm saying whoever doesn't know this game, find out and play it!!
0060594896|3.0|This recommendation is based on having read dozens of books in this genre and taking thorough notes.<br /><br />If you want to learn the standards, here you go.
B003PJ6UHA|4.0|I don't think I buy what the author's are selling in this book, not completely. Their arguments are compelling and their data seem to support their theories, but many of the arguments they put forth against more conventional descriptions of reality can be used just as effectively against the biocentric model.<br /><br />Nevertheless I found it to be a thought-provoking book and refreshingly devoid of mysticism. The questions raised about the conventional models held by most human beings about the nature of the reality in which they exist are valid and important. This book serves, if not as a model for a new understanding of our reality, as a reminder that we are practically blind to reality in the glare of our perceptions.
B0088ETCHW|5.0|This is an excellent book! I have this book on Kindle and find it to be invaluable. It's very well written, very insightful, and the authors  do an excellent job of getting the point across regardless of your  experience level swimming.<br /><br />Even though the title mentions coaching system, this book is a really good reference/instruction guide for swimmers of any level and anybody that's looking  to improve for swim skills for pool or open water. Lots of well done illustrations and clearly written.<br /><br />I have been a big fan of the swim smooth approach to swimming. I think this is one of their best efforts yet. Highly recommend this book to swimmers and/or triathletes.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read for entertainment.  Does a book keep me entertained, intrigued and coming back for more?  This book did that with a vengeance even with the dark subject matters it took on.
B005544V6A|5.0|You wouldn't think a show about a high profile corporate law firm would be anything new or worth getting excited about--However,  Suits is in a class by itself!<br />The Premise is wonderful and the characters give the show it's unique nature.  They are brilliant, quirky, funny, interesting and multi-layered.  The writing is wonderful and I am hooked!  I also appreciate that the writing contains little to no political agenda.  I'm very tired of TV Show writers putting in their own liberal biases into thier characters, plots, and bylines.  Hopefully the Suits writers will continue with thier brilliant character developments plots, and not cheapen the show with silly liberal infusions.
B0086213XW|1.0|First off, I must say that I REALLY love 'independent' films. I mean, insert: [[ASIN:B00002SSKW Twin Falls Idaho]], [[ASIN:B003L20ICE The Kids Are All Right]] and [[ASIN:B00013WWSY My Life Without Me]] here.<br /><br />Now the thing about the last film I mentioned, [[ASIN:B00013WWSY My Life Without Me]], actually starred Sara Polley, because the film that I'm here to talk about: [[ASIN:B0086213XW Take This Waltz (Theatrical Rental)]], was directed AND written by her.<br /><br />Now, I LOVE Sara Polley as an actor. She was absolutely WONDERFUL in [[ASIN:B00013WWSY My Life Without Me]]. And based off that film, she should know what a good independent film should be like.<br /><br />Only with this one, I'm not so sure? I'm not even sure WHY this film HAD to be made??? (Let me just carry on with my review and maybe I can figure it out?)<br /><br />First it's like when we meet the Michelle Williams character, she's at some kind of re-enactment thing (WHY?) I think she's supposed to be some kind of writer or something? (Though you don't ever get to see her do much writing or even see her talk to her editor or publisher or whoever she's supposed to work for.) Even if she's supposed to be doing freelance work, I think it would've been cool to see her send off an email or two to SOMEONE--I really didn't get this part of the movie.<br /><br />Anyway, at this re-enactment thing it's like she meets up with this guy (who just happens to be there too???) who ALSO happens to have a seat next to her on the plane back home, who HAPPENS to ALREADY live right across the street from her--now, I can't tell you how long either one of them have lived there, but I can tell you that even if you've lived in your neighborhood a week, you'd notice this guy.<br /><br />Only of course, the Michelle Williams character hasn't. (This part of the movie was just weird, it was just sooo/too coincidental and it all added up to one big WHO cares???) In a real life context, meaning as the filmmakers wereputting this film together, it makes PERFECT sense to have the second lead live right across the street. I'm thinking that it's in keeping the production costs down to have him just across the way. Only for the sake of the film, why OH WHY would it make sense that the two of them hadn't already seen each other? If anything, it could've only ADDED to the part when they DID meet up at the re-enactment thing and then on the airplane.<br /><br />This to me, would've been COMPLETELY plausible. Oh well, these film people are going to do what they want anyway, go figure?<br /><br />Also, it seemed that the Michelle Williams character ALWAYS had this weird 'dreamy' look on her face. Like she was on the verge of smiling or crying or waking up or SOMETHING??? And it just seemed (REAL) bizarre.<br /><br />It was bizarre how she interacted with her husband played by Seth Rogen. It was like the two of them would act like a couple of little kids with all the 'I wuv yous' (instead of the 'I love yous'). And then it was all the talk that was violent that was 'supposed' to be 'cute'. Things that I can't/won't repeat. But it would sound like 'I love you so much I'm going to push you in front of a moving bus.' REAL crazy stuff like that. And was that supposed to be cute or romantic or WHAT??? I mean, REALLY what was that supposed to be about?<br /><br />Also, I got NO chemistry between Michelle or Seth or the guy she met at the re-enactment thing--the guy who happens to be her neighbor.<br /><br />I know chemistry is a hard thing to define, but when you see it, you see it. And trust me folks, there was absolutely NONE to see here. NONE AT ALL!!!<br /><br />And the thing with the neighbor guy. We're REALLY supposed to believe that all he does for a living is run his own rickshaw car? (And there's nothing wrong with that.) Only, I can't see where there's any real money in it? I mean, how you could set something up like that, is that you give him a nice back story wherein what he REALLYdoes is teach science at a high school, only during his summer hiatus, he does this, you know the rickshaw driving. With this scenario, you could maybe START to believe that this could be a doable occupation. Maybe?<br /><br />Only NO, this wouldn't be the case at all. Oh yeah, and he ALSO happens to be an artist--the kind who paints...only for himself folks. (And there's nothing wrong with that either.) Only to me, this guy was 'artsy' enough with the rickshaw job. Next, it's like we're going to find him making candles, while doing tie-dye and baking bread--all from the back of that darn rickshaw!!!<br /><br />This movie was just too much. (At the theater where I saw this, more than one person got up and left.) And that was a shame too, considering that it was actually sold-out. I mean, let's face it, sometimes people want to see something other than the third sequel to this franchise or the next re-boot to that one.<br /><br />Sadly, this didn't prove to be a better choice either.<br /><br />And note to Michelle Williams, I'm STILL waiting to see you in something that could be considered HALF as good as the work you did in [[ASIN:B000MVQIEO Dawson's Creek Seasons 1-6 Bundle]].
B007C7UZIG|1.0|Haven't actually used the app, I'm far from home and am having problems with my password.  This can't be reset on the web and this app won't do it either.  So no access and no giving Valve my money for the next few days.  Major oversight, very disappointed.
030758836X|1.0|If you have read the book and are looking for opinions about this weird book and the major WTF? at the end, here's a 2 cent opinion.  Initially loved the book and like others who have so stated, wanted to recommend it to others via word of mouth before ending the book.  Glad I didn't.<br /><br />Yes, we get the whole modern day relationships Men are from Mars juxtapositioned with a twist that Woman are also from Mars....but the author did a mean trick by setting up for a big finish - considering the major plot turn with the kidnap and the subsequent murder - considering the fact that the male main character \\"Lance\\" kept repeating that he had something good in mind then totally wussed out - yeah, it was pretty bad.<br /><br />What is interesting is the trend in today's semi-literate book/kindle publishing pop culture is the fact that this book is somewhat (but more egregious I'll give you that) representative of the endings seen today for \\"best sellers.\\"  The books start promising, they hook you with major plot twists and turns and then the ending just falls off a cliff or becomes so implausible that one tends to feel had.<br /><br />Can't wait for the movie.
B006RUJST6|5.0|This story is strong and touching. I laughed and cried many times. Yes there may be a few mistakes in grammar or editing but the overall performance of this author is wonderful. Like any artistic performance it is about what the art makes you feel. Even the most seasoned musician gets off key or out of time but the music still moves you. How anyone could give this story low ratings is beyond me.<br /><br />The characters seem real which can be very hard to pull off. It may be considered a YA novel but it certainly is better than any adult fiction I have read in a while. While the main characters are young adults this story is one that any adult with a heart can enjoy and relate to.<br /><br />As a romance novel it it may disappoint some who are looking for hot and steamy. This is more of a love story. It is about a young couple falling in love who must face some difficult life experiences and problems. It is NOT a cookie cutter romance and thank God for that. This story is about life, the joys and the sorrow. It is about family and love.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|I think it fun 2 play because it challenges my brain by<br />making it think how to get it in the mouth
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love this app its cute and so addicting! I your looking for a new game to keep you from being bored..... PICK THIS ONE!!
B000VDDDY6|5.0|I went about this backwards. I already had Seasons two and three before I bought Season one. I have all three seasons in the Remastered version. I'm not going to talk much about the episodes other that they are good. It's the technology used in making these DVDs that's great. One can really see it on the space scenes whether it's the Enterprise itself or the scenes in space. I was really amazed with the remastering in the episode \\"The Galileo Seven\\". It really stood out in that episode. I do believe if the technology used to make these DVDs was available back in the 1960's Gene Rodenberry would have used it. I have seen reviews from those whom think the remastered DVDs aren't good. They think it takes something away from the purity. Well for that crowd there are Star Trek DVDs that aren't remastered. Buy those. I am one of those who think the remastered versions add something good to the series. So all in all I am pleased with the product. I am also pleased with how fast I got the item after ordering. I used the free Super Saver shipping and had the item in like a week. Again good job.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun, but could use instructions for new players.  A good way to pass time and try to better you agility while racking up points for additional games.  It is addictive so allow time to play.
B006RUJST6|5.0|This book kept me on the edge of my seat. Felt every emotion the characters felt. So descriptive & full of emotion! Very well written. Would love to see Slammed & Point of Retreat go to the big screen.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.Reviews I read about this book claimed that it lacked depth and the characters were one dimensional,however if you are not a critic and just want a damn good book to read that is hard to put down then this is the book for you.Highly recommended
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this has been very User friendly for my kindle. the design is nice and functional. I highly recommend if you need a simple easy to use calf.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|its fun and awesome. although I don't like the fact that you run out of energy quickly. you have to sit around a lot
B0086700CM|3.0|The game is fun but I wish there was a way to advance to different levels. It can get frustrating starting from the beginnign every time and as the game continues your character speeds up to the point of not being able to control him. I have been playing for about 3 weeks now and will play for a little while longer because the game is addictive.
B001Q2U5B0|4.0|(Author of [[ASIN:B008LFMEUA Seconds From Jane]])<br /><br />This movie is very smart.  I watch or read most everything that comes out about time travel.  I love the treatment of the metaphysical aspects of time travel that this movie deals with.  Really makes you think.  I gave four stars instead of five because I'd love to watch this a few more times, but it's just too disturbing.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|Works well on my Asus Tablet. Very intuitive and offers a lot of editing options. Easy to upload to Facebook, etc. Would recommend to anyone .

030758836X|1.0|This is by far the worst book I have read all year.  I plowed through hundreds of pages, hoping that justice would prevail and was left with the most improbably ending an author could imagine.  The characters are completely unbelievable;  Amy has committed murder and has plotted for months the degradation and possible execution of her husband.  Yet, she tricks him by getting pregnant and he says, ok, let's play nice!!!!!!!!  Grrrrr.  There has to be better literature for us to spend money on than this claptrap.  I am totally disgusted!!!
0345803507|5.0|this was a very good book with a good plot line. kept me interested for hours and i couldn't put it down.
B00846REIS|1.0|The Bared to You is just garbage and a try to COPY KAT 50 Shades of Grey.  Gideon is not charming at all, what a turn off. I guess I am a hopeless romantic and if you want something romatic, this book is not it. Yes, I do have to at least finish the book, but it is very hard to do when there is nothing romantic about the rich  Gideon's approach to Eva.  The writer's approach is blunt, no mystery at all and really just boring. This book seemed to be written in a rush to make a money off of a fad that is happening.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I read all three books in the series.  This was the least favorite.  The first one was a spellbinder.  By the third book I felt it was just all about the fantasy and the violence.  The first one the characters were more grounded in their humanity with just enough of fantasy to tease the intellect and the emotions.  Last book I could have done without.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is a very fun game and once you play it you will be addicted. I love this game. you have to play it.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this game! It is so fun and it never gets boring. I like how it gives you goals to meet.
0439023491|5.0|Reading this book made me realize how much thought goes into writing such a brilliant book with a brilliant storyline.<br /><br />This book is not about The Hunger Games anymore, it is not even about a romance, or about District 12. This book is about rebellion, revolting against a despicable and vile government, about all 12 districts joining hands to overthrow their leaders and take back what is theirs - basic needs, human rights and so on.<br /><br />In that sense, it made me think a little too much about the \\"Arab Spring\\" and all the different countries revolting after only one man set himself on fire. Very fitting too, as this second installment of \\"The Hunger Games\\" trilogy is called \\"Catching Fire\\". In Katniss's case, all it took is her seeming act of rebellion when she almost took her own life with the poisonous berries.<br /><br />President Snow of the country of Panem now seeks revenge. His methods of revenge are beyond contempt and even begin to stir his own people of the Capitol. Yes, Collins could have gone into more detail, moved the events quickly and so on, but I thought the first half of the book with Katniss being back home and showing us the dynamics of her new everyday life was very important to set up the rest of the book and what is yet to come in the third and final installment. The slow build up to a full-blown revolution is extremely crucial, and Collins did a great job introducing different characters throughout, giving us bits and pieces of what will come, throwing in hints and clues and feeding Katniss and Peeta new pieces of information for them to use in the war to come (p.s. District 13 plays a huge role in all of it).<br /><br />This book has a bit of everything, but at the core of it all is that cry for help. The cry that pleads so save humanity. That cry many ignore and turn a deaf ear to. It brings to clear focus what a dystopian world is like.<br /><br />The ending makes you sit at the edge of your seat. In fact, I have the third book next to me just waiting to be read as I write this review. These kids have already been through so much angst, and suffering that I can't even imagine what Collins has waiting for them next.book next to me just waiting to be read as I write this review.

1612130283|4.0|Many of you have written a negative review of this book which makes me wonder... are you afraid of letting yourself enjoy a book for it's face value. Have you totally missed the point of reading this genre of book? Some books aren't meant to be looked at so closely. Some are meant to be read and enjoyed. I know my husband enjoyed my reading the books and so did I. For those people who choose to put the book down and criticize the author, remember this her first attempt at writing and no one ever does something this big exactly right the first time. Try, try again E.L.James.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love this game so much its really really really fun and I play it every day! best game in the history of the world
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Having just watched the Cinema release of the\\"Dark Knight Rises\\" as well as numerous Blu Ray sessions with the previous Batman movies, I am convinced that the Nolan's wanted to portray Batman as a more \\"flesh and blood\\" hero than in their prevous outings - and they have succeeded !<br /><br />While there is every bit as much action/reaction and plot twists as before, it all comes down to Bruce Wayne/Batman being able to put a more \\"human\\" perspective into the story, that really gets the viewer involved in this movie.<br /><br />I can't recommend this movie to everyone that wanted a \\"comic book\\" outcome to the finale, however I would highly recommend seeing this if you wanted a more  heroic / human  aspect to the movie, that shows how a \\"real\\" person would be if they were Batman - we all want the same things.

B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I like this game but after a while it gets kind of boring. At first I could not stop playing but now I hardly play it.
B008JH5CVS|1.0|This movie is awful in every way. There really isn't anything good about it except it is set in space and space is cool. Beyond that the acting, dialog, CGI, storyline, characters, and everything else with this movie is absolutely terrible. I have no idea how I was able to watch it all the way through except for some weird deer-in-headlights situation. Also Guy Pearce's constant one-liners were atrocious and forced.
B00005JPFH|2.0|This movie should have focused solely about Peter and Harry's feud that was building up through the events of Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2. (And maybe they could have fit Dr. Connors turning into the Lizard if they would have written it correctly.)<br /><br />At the end of Spidey 2 Harry finds out who Peter is and wants to seek revenge on him for his fathers death because he believes Peter killed him. He finds his fathers Goblin gear and chemical compound. So the audience assumes he's going transform himself into either the Green Goblin or maybe even the Hobgoblin. Instead in Spider-man 3 he becomes this weird new character on a flying skateboard that does not resemble the original Green Goblin at all. And as bad as that was, thats what the whole movie should have mainly focused around.<br /><br />But the studio had its mind set that they absolutely must introduce Venom in this movie. It was not up to Sam Raimi (the director) at all. So they forced the whole symbiote saga into this movie. I'm not even going to go into how horribly they executed this, (emo Peter Parker) and how rushed it felt. But in the end Venom shows up at the end of the movie for like 20 minutes. In my opinion (and many others) Venom is the BEST Spider-Man villain and they only gave him 20 minutes!!!??? This symbiote saga could and should have easily been its own movie or even 2 movies for crying out loud!!!!<br /><br />Then if that not bad enough, in this movie they also have the villain Sandman. Thats right 3 villains in one movie. They did try to give the character of Sandman more backstory than he originally had in the comics, but the story they gave him was awful and it destroyed the original story of how Uncle Ben died. I actually enjoyed Thomas Haden Church's performance as Sandman, but this absolutely should not have been in this movie. The movie already had too much in it, this just made it WAY over the top.<br /><br />If all that wasn't enough they decide to make Peter and Mary-Jane split up and introduce Gwen Stacy and Peter's new love interest in this train-wreck of a movie.<br /><br />So I give this movie 2 stars. The only reason it doesn't get just 1 star is because I am a big Spider-Man fan and the entire cast came back and tried to save what they must have known was going to be an awful movie. They were set to start filming Spider-Man 4 for release in Summer 2011 but the entire thing fell apart weeks before shooting was scheduled. I can only assume the script was even more awful then Spidey 3 and no re-write in history could save it. So the entire cast and Sam Raimi decided to split. That is probably fantastic news for all Spidey fans for not having to witness another train-wreck movie.<br /><br />So if I could have done this, Spidey 3 would have been about Harry and Peter's feud and possibly  would have brought in the Lizard. Spidey 4 would have introduced the symbiote via the space shuttle crash like it should have been. It could have had black-suited Spidey vs. Sandman or some other villain and in the end teased the audience with Venom. And then Spidey 5 would just be the all out Spidey vs. Venom movie that everyone would have wanted to see, and they never would have had to reboot the franchise as early as they had to.
0345803485|1.0|I am baffled at the women of the world right now. Is this book for real? Do people actually read this and think it's erotic/well-written/riveting/any other reason you would waste your time continuing to read it?! First of all, from the first page, it is evident that this author wouldn't know how to write a novel if one sat on her face. Second of all, it takes 7, yes 7, painstaking chapters for the main charters to even remotely cross the line from sounding like they are 13 years old. Considering this book is supposed to be such a must-read due to its erotic content, I waited those 7 chapters assuming its raunch may make up for its literary short-comings. No such luck. It seems this \\"writer\\" can't even dream up a better word for the female anatomy than \\"there\\" (e.g. \\"Suddenly he was touching me there\\"). She actually even wrote the words \\"he positioned the head of his erection at the entrance of my sex.\\". Are you freaking kidding me? This felt more like an awkward period spent in sex education than an intriguing or even semi-interesting erotic novel. I'm sorry, but unless you're completely void of both intellect and sexual prowess, this book will not deliver the way it sadly has for the \\"desperate housewives\\" set. This book is hardly pushing the envelope. The only hype this book lived up to is being the semi-grown version of Twilight; I see the sad emo tweens that grew up cherishing that vampire series easily settling in to believe that this is a literary masterpiece, as well. I'm sure Justin Bieber will play Christian in a few years when they develop the film treatment as a way of shedding his boyish image.<br /><br />If I hadn't purchased this on my iPad, I'd have thrown it across the room in disgust. I'll be seeking a refund for sure.
0143038419|5.0|\\"Tis' better to live your own life imperfectly than to imitate someone else's perfectly.\\" -Eat, Pray, Love<br /><br />I went against my #1 rule when it comes to reading. I watched the movie first.<br /><br />I love Julia Roberts. From Pretty Woman to Mona Lisa Smile, I think she is just stunning. One lonely night, while scrapbooking and lounging around I watched Eat, Pray, Love.<br /><br />I loved the movie (it hit home for me)... and the next day I purchased the book.<br /><br />Now, I have a rather large reading list... and a book-buying problem. So Eat, Pray, Love, sat on my bookshelf for quite awhile before I got the chance to read it.<br /><br />The book (and movie) is a true story about a woman, Elizabeth Gilbert, and her search for herself. Gilbert takes you on her journey around the world through Italy, India and Indonesia.<br /><br />Eat- A journey in self-indulgence. What better place to go then Italy? The Italians certainly have the best food.<br /><br />Pray- Finding peace and your personal higher power.<br /><br />Love- While it was not Gilbert's original intention to find love in Indonesia, she did. A love that the sequel, Committed, dives into in more detail.<br /><br />\\"Your emotions are the slaves to your thoughts, and you are the slave to your emotions.\\" -Eat, Pray, Love<br /><br />Daily I ponder why I am not where I thought I would be at this stage in my life: almost thirty.<br /><br />Why am I not married? Why haven't I started a family? Why does it seem like everyone else is getting there while I am stalling out?<br /><br />At the beginning of Eat, Pray, Love Liz had it all: a husband, someone who wanted to start a family with her and a great career.<br /><br />Yet, while she knew she was supposed to want all those things at 30, she was unhappy.<br /><br />Liz filed for divorce, packed her bags, and embarked on a journey to find herself and her happiness. Along the way she met a fantastic cast of characters. Her wit and sarcasm throughout her tale made me laugh out loud.<br /><br />And although in the beginning everything seemed like it would never be ok-- in the end it was. Liz found her true happiness.<br /><br />\\"I think I deserve something beautiful.\\" -Eat, Pray, Love<br /><br />Ever since I was a little girl, all I ever wanted when I grew up was a husband and a family. And by now I feel as though I should be there already. In reality I am not even close. (And, yes, I realize that a lot of that is all in my head.)<br /><br />Eat, Pray, Love by Elizabeth Gilbert  gave me hope. I was astonished by her decision to leave comfort (I don't think I have that kind of strength) and inspired to start taking things day by day. Making everything count. Enjoying what I have.<br /><br />It's cheesy, but true: Everything in life happens for a reason. We all have our own path. That path is not set in stone.

159413586X|3.0|(Spoilers) I finished the first two books in this series in 3 days.  Catching Fire was amazing.  I could not wait to see how the series would end with Mockingjay. I was disappointed.  VERY disappointed with the ending.  For starters, I may be in the minority when I say that I did not really care for a lot of aspects of Peeta's character.  Yes, he is loving, kind, brave, all that good stuff.  But his love for Katniss is borderline creepy.  He is a bit too obsessed, to the point that he did not even have a reaction that his entire family died in the bombing of District 12.  I have liked Gale from the beginning.  Katniss' confidant has been with her since childhood.  They shared the same pain and the same love.  Gale is a hero and is brave in a different way than Peeta.  Gale is not blinded by obsession but fights for the greater cause.  I absolutely HATED the fact that there was such an abrupt ending between Katniss and Gale.  HATED it.<br /><br />I realized quickly that it is a terrible idea to become attached to characters in these books.  The only person that I wanted to live by the end was Finnick.  I thought that Finnick emerged as one of the most admirable characters, a mix of Gale and Peeta's best qualities.  (But of course I couldnt think that he WOULD actually live).<br /><br />I thought that Katniss lost her spark, but I dont know where or why.  By the end, I did not admire her character anymore. She had moments of monologue about her self realization that she was never a nice person, but did she mean it?  Or believe it?  Or want to change it?  She had lost her passion for Peeta, Gale, the cause.<br /><br />Finally, I thought that the epilogue and final chapters were extremely rushed. A three page epilogue to wrap up 1200 pages of story?  That does not make any sense.  Not to mention I did not like the ending anyway.<br /><br />And an afterthought, these books are written at a 5th grade reading level, but are nowhere near appropriate for a 5th grader.  The love, the gore, and the political content is a bit over the head of an 11 year old.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I've had this book for about a month now.  I figured with such hype and its comfy sport on the best seller's list, that it was some sort of thriller.  WRONG.  This is porn delivered directly to your Kindle... and sh*tty porn at that.  I'm not even a romance reader, so the lack of plot, excitement adventure left me utterly and completely bored.  I have made my best effort to get through the book, with friends cheering me on, telling me that the second and third books are \\"better.\\"  Unfortunately, I end up tossing my Kindle down shortly after I pick it up, and after a month I am still only have way through tying to cope with Ana and her \\"inner goddess.\\" (Could this book BE anymore repetitive? Yes.  I did type that in my Chandler voice.)  If you're looking for lame S&M smut porn, seriously, save your money.  The internet is full of it and it's free.  That's why Al Gore invented it, after all.  The WORST part of this book is that a very dear friend of mine spent her hard earned money gifting me this mess.  I feel like E.L. James owes her $10.  And a promise to never write another book.  Ever.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Another Baldacci thriller that will not disappoint the reader. Fast paced and full of twists and turns.

0307341577|5.0|I love a great thriller that is smart and includes great writing technique.  This piece fiits the bill.  I didn't have a favorite author until I read this book!! Gillian Flynn tells a great story with excellent skill.  This is my pick for my book club!  Outstanding!
0307341550|3.0|I bought Sharp Objects because a friend of mine suckered me into joining a book club that would be focusing on \\"Gone Girl\\" for the month of July. I'd heard such amazing things about Gillian Flynn as a writer, I figured - What the heck. I need new books to read this summer, I'll go ahead and get all of her novels and read them all. I have a rather macabre sense of humor, and love a good mystery, so I figured that her books would be right up my alley.<br /><br />I read this along with Dark Places, and was slightly disappointed. The way both books have been hyped, rave reviews, I was looking forward to books that I could immediately delve into, have difficulty putting down, and would want to read again and again to pick up any details that I may have missed. I tend to be obsessive about books like this. Weird, I know, but when I find good writing, I love to wrap myself in it and absorb as much as I can.<br /><br />Having said that, I probably won't read this book again. It was written well, comprehendible, but I did not find myself desiring more. The facts were presented flatly, but with enough detail that additional information wasn't necessary. The characters were very journalistically presented. Not completely two dimensional, but not vibrant enough to jump off of the page and dazzle. I felt that the personality traits and disorders were very textbook. While the author obviously wished to create complex, defining characters, I found myself underwhelmed. As I mentioned in my review for Dark Places, I did finish this book rather quickly, but not because I couldn't put it down - it was because it was too danged hot outside and I don't normally watch tv. The books passed the time.<br /><br />The plot twists seemed very poorly presented to me, as a \\"GOTCHA!\\" at the very end of the tale. I felt that the book very readily followed the plot structures in middle school - the exposition introducing Camille, the chain of events leading to the climax of the story, a couple of more events, a supposed resolution, and then BAM another climax right before the conclusion. The second shocker towards the end of the book was poorly executed. All of the energy was used up in the preceding dramatic event, and this seemed to be added as a \\"Well, I guess I have to wrap up that loose end as well, let's make it dramatic!\\" type situation.<br /><br />I'd recommend it, I guess, but I wasn't as impressed as I'd expected to be. I'll definitely pass it on down the family library, but I don't see it as a book that I am eagerly awaiting to read again.ore events, a supposed resolution, and then BAM another climax right before the conclusion.

B000FBJFSC|5.0|This is a must read for every Irish-American.  Too often we have this Hallmark, profiteering few of Ireland that is all shamrocks, Claddagh rings and intricately ivory woven sweaters.  Frank McCourt gives an honest, humorous and heartbreaking account of early 20th century life for an Irish Catholic family shuttled from Ireland to America and back.  This is the part of Irish history that American Clans are either completely ignorant to, or go out of their way to Guinness and jig up.  One of my favorite all time reads; it truly helped me understand my own set of Irish immigrant grandparents and opened my eyes to the rooting of our family dynamics.
140131046X|5.0|Mitch Albom got his start as a sports writer, but he's better known to the general reader as the author of the inspirational books Tuesdays With Morrie and The Five People You Meet in Heaven, both of which were made into TV movies.  Have a Little Faith is in the same genre as Tuesdays With Morrie.<br /><br />Albom grew up in suburban New Jersey, where his family is actively involved in a local synagogue.  Since leaving home, Albom has not actively practiced his faith, but the rabbi, Albert Lewis, asked Albom to do his eulogy.  That led Albom to spend hours and hours with Lewis over the next several years.  As their friendship grows, so does Albom's appreciation for the rabbi he knew as a child but never really knew.<br /><br />Lewis served this congregation for generations; it's the only placed he ever served.  Albom's reports of their time spent together bring out Lewis's wisdom and teaching in such a way that make the reader long to sit at his feet and listen to stories.  Their conversations range widely, encompassing questions big and little.  As a Jewish man married to a Christian, Albom is especially interested in the question of inter-religious relations.  Lewis tells the story of an early episode in his tenure.  After an ugly encounter between a priest from the parish next door and one of the synagogue members, the priest (at the insistence of his superior) and Rabbi Lewis walked arm in arm around the parish schoolyard, during recess, in a demonstration of the fact that the two faiths can coexist.  Albom asked Lewis, \\"But what if someone from another faith won't recognize yours?  Or wants you dead for it?\\"  Lewis sagely replied, \\"That is not faith.  That is hate.\\"<br /><br />Lewis always had a ready answer, or at least a question to make the questioner reflect.  Full of wit, always singing, and loved by all, Lewis left a deep impression on Albom and everyone with whom he came into contact.  Lewis did not hold back when Albom asked him the secret to his happiness: \\"Be satisfied.  Be grateful.  For what you have.  For the love you receive.  And for what God has given you.  That's it.\\"<br /><br />During the time Albom was meeting with Lewis, he also met Henry Covington, pastor of Pilgrim Church and director of I am My Brother's Keeper in Detroit.  This inner city ministry, a church and homeless outreach, was struggling, poor, and small, but full of faith.  Covington's story, though very different from Lewis's, inspired Albom in different ways.  Covington had been in and out of prison, immersed in drugs and crime, when he became a Christian and began serving others.  Albom initially met Covington to investigate the ministry, to determine whether his foundation would give them a grant.  He got to know Covington, visiting him on several occasions and attending services at the church.  He eventually wrote a newspaper column about their having the heat turned off because of their failure to pay the gas bill.  It didn't help that the roof of the old church had a gaping hole.  That little bit of publicity brought interest and money to the ministry, and now the church has a solid roof! (Read about that here.)<br /><br />Albom's storytelling skill and sensitive portrayals of Lewis and Covington draw the reader into a rare circle of friendship and shared faith.  Have a Little Faith reminds us of the treasures that can be found talking with the regular people around us.  We might be inspired by the biographies of great leaders or historical figures, but these two clergymen, common men by the standards of history, possess and convey the kind of greatness that really matters, impacting the lives of people around them.  There are volumes to be written about our neighbors, the family in the pew behind us in church, the family who runs the dry cleaners I go to, the bus driver who picks up my daughter every day.  I know those books will never be written, but Albom reminds me that if I take time to listen, I might hear some stories worth remembering and will likely learn a few things about living life.membering and will likely learn a few things about living life.

They picked an interesting cover that piqued my interest from the start. The reviews I'd read also seemed very promising. Without giving any plot twists away, I do have to say that while the book was good, it didn't live up to my expectations of phenomenal storytelling.<br /><br />I find that Dark Places very obviously followed the plot structure we studied in middle school, but with a hipster twist. Protagonist - Libby Day. Sole survivor of her family's brutal murder at the hands of her brother in the heartland of America. Physically and mentally damaged by the attack, she's coasted through life on the money raised from her story, and we meet her just as the funds are beginning to run out. As things seem particularly bleak, she's contacted by a member of a \\"Kill Club,\\" followers of serial killers - specifically a group of individuals who believe that her brother is innocent.<br /><br />There are a plethora of antagonists in this book - all creatively and quirkily introduced, but remain painfully two dimensional. I've read books before where all of the characters jump out at you and seem so real that they're easily imagined. The characters presented in this novel were simply fuzzy characteristics, nothing sticking out to me other than physical characteristics mentioned many times by the author. The settings did not particularly pop out at me either, and was very blandly presented. There were moments in the book that were rather gruesome, and I am disappointed to say that those scenes stick out more in my mind than any other aspect of the book. I'm sure it was not intended to be that way, but the most I've taken away from this book are imagined scenes of animal torture (that's a plot point I don't feel guilty in giving away - I wish I had known - I have a strong stomach, but that scene truly disturbed me).<br /><br />I did enjoy the read - it wasn't completely unpalatable. We've had some strikingly warm days lately, so I have been curling up on the couch with her novels to beat the heat. I finished it faster than I'd expected due to this fact, but it isn't a book I see myself reading again in the near future. I'll pass it on down the family library, though.  Recommended if you've got time to kill and want a fast read. For something more substantial and with better character development, try The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series - it's one of the best (semi)recent releases. Another amazing story that actually moved me to tears - American Skin by Don DeGrazia. I would recommend it highly.those scenes stick out more in my mind than any other aspect of the book.

B008CRC506|3.0|Smash started out as a very promising show. I was so excited for it to premiere as I embody the target demographic. I love musicals, Marc Shaiman, Katharine McPhee, Christian Borle, Debra Messing, Brian D'Arcy James, and Marilyn Monroe. And even throughout the first season I found little things to love. But this show quickly became a mess. They tried to do too much. They had no handle on the point they were trying to get across. And the writing...the writing was terrible. Painfully bad.<br /><br />The very best parts are some truly wonderful performances, clever original songs, and some great cast members. I could listen to \\"Let Me Be Your Star\\", \\"Touch Me\\" and \\"I Never Met a Wolf Who Didn't Love to Howl\\" over and over. And it was wonderful that they found a reason for Christian Borle to perform with \\"Don't Say Yes Untl I Finish Talking\\". The man just puts a smile on my face. And topping it off by casting Marc Kudisch in the stage performance? Wonderful.<br /><br />The worst parts are the writing, the underutilization of great actors like Brian D'Arcy James, overacting, flat acting, and mess of a plot. The writing sank season 1. It was the problem at the core of the show. The dialogue was bad and the plot was convoluted. People did things for no apparent reason and characters quickly made themselves unlikable. Why would they hire Brian D'Arcy James and only let him sing a short clip to a rock band style video game? Megan Hilty was usually overacting and when she dropped her Marilyn impersonation her shouting and screeching was painful. I've hated that aspect of her voice since she was in Wicked. Debra Messing was also overacting and the entire Michael Swift plotline was irritating beyond belief. There was a time when nothing about the show seemed genuine and I spent the episodes longing to be rescued by a musical number. As for flat acting, that would be Katharine McPhee and the actor playing Dev. Every plotline with Dev felt extraneous. It dragged the show down. The worst actor by far though was the one playing Debra Messing's son.<br /><br />There are enough redeeming qualities that I hope they can recover the promise of the pilot in season 2. They just need better writers.

0345803485|1.0|Recipe for bestseller:<br />Step 1: Take a current bestseller<br />Step 2: Edit out the vampire line. The main male character must be compensated for the lack of magical skills, for example, by making him \\"stunningly handsome\\" and \\"rich beyond imagination\\".  Any other cool skills could be added to the taste, with salt and pepper.<br />Step 3: Use \\"Edit/Replace\\" function as much as possible (for example: replace \\"gaze\\" by \\"peek\\", \\"stutter\\" by \\"mutter\\"). Hint: don't forget to change the names of the characters (for example, replace \\"Bella\\" with \\"Ana\\"); there is no need to update the main characteristics.<br />Step 4: to ensure the book popularity, make the language as simple as possible. Don't use long complicated words. For the best results, limit the vocabulary to grade 6 reading level and repeat the words a sufficient number of times. Suggestions: \\"Smirk\\", \\"Grin\\", \\"roll the eyes\\". (Hint: to compensate for this drawback, make the heroine to major in English, so she would be able to recite the poetry in between erotic scenes).<br />Step 5: Close your eyes and remember your teenage erotic dreams . Write it down - anytime you don't know what else to put on the page. Repeat until you feel a little nauseous.<br />Step 6: Call your publisher. Ask NOT to edit the book, to keep it fresh and original.<br /><br />Serve to the public.<br /><br />P.S. At least, this book made me laugh. Hence one star.

He also understands the business of illustration and how to pay attention to this vital part of the picture.  His book is a classic for caricature and portrait artists.  Bravo.
0307454568|5.0|Having read the first Larsson book I looked forward to the second, but wondered if the author could follow up with a second book as  outstanding as the first. I most definitely was not disappointed. If anything the second is better than the first. His character development, attention to detail, and high suspense is phenomenal. I can't think of any other contemporary author in this genre who comes anywhere close. So sorry that I only have one more book to go. His death is a major loss of talent.

B001DHXT20|4.0|In 2003, Ang Lee directed a brooding, inward-looking movie about the Incredible Hulk... and it bombed at the box office as badly as it did with fans.<br /><br />So there was much rejoicing when the franchise got rebooted five years later with \\"The Incredible Hulk.\\" This is what a movie about a giant green rage-monster should be -- a lean, muscular action movie with a thread of bittersweet romance, and solid performances by William Hurt, Edward Norton and Liv Tyler.<br /><br />A few years ago, Bruce Banner was exposed to gamma radiation in a failed military experiment, which turned him into a giant green berserker. Ever since then, the cruel General Ross (Hurt) has been mercilessly pursuing him, so they can create giant green soldiers.<br /><br />And after a few years hiding in Brazil, Banner is finally found by the military... only to end up on the run after he Hulks his way out of the confrontation. He may be able to get a cure, but only if he gets the original data from the experiment, which means sneaking back into the US to see his ex-girlfriend Betty (Tyler). Betty is also Ross's daughter. Awkward.<br /><br />And after the military attacks him again, Banner ends up hulking out, then goes on the run with Betty to find a cure. But he doesn't know that Ross has taken special measures to capture him, by dosing elite soldier Neil Blonsky (Tim Roth) with a supersoldier serum -- which unleashes a monster far worse than the Hulk.<br /><br />\\"The Incredible Hulk\\" gave audiences everything that Ang Lee's movie was missing. It has pretty much everything you can ask from a movie about a giant green id-monster -- lots of explosions, gunfire, chases, and a core story about a man whose life is destroyed by the ambitious people who want to use the Hulk's power.<br /><br />And the movie lopes along at a fast pace, slowing down for the occasional romantic scene when Betty and Bruce are alone. There are some funny moments (\\"Don't make me... hungry!\\"), but the overall mood is a somber one -- you're always aware of danger, and how much Bruce has lost through no fault of his own.<br /><br />The one problem I have with this movie? Edward Norton. Don't get me wrong, his performance is absolutely stellar, and his rewrites of the script made the movie even better. But he doesn't quite work as the quiet, shy nerd -- he can't turn off the wiry intensity that he always exudes.<br /><br />But the other actors are spot on -- Hurt as a cold, sociopathic soldier who doesn't care who dies as long as he gets the Hulk, Tyler as the loving supportive Betty who can soothe the savage beast, and Roth as a battle-happy soldier whose obsession with fighting turns him into a monster.<br /><br />\\"The Incredible Hulk\\" is exactly what you'd want from a Hulk movie -- romance, tragedy, and Hulk smashing. A fun popcorn movie with some darker edges.mber one -- you're always aware of danger, and how much Bruce has lost through no fault of his own.<br /><br />The one problem I have with this movie?

B007SGM084|5.0|Ok, I admit it, I caved in to the \\"50 Shades\\" hype.  Am I glad I did?  Sure, it's an entertaining read, but, I'll warn you, the first book will frustrate you at times, and, if I hadn't downloaded it to my Kindle, it would've hit the wall a time or three because both characters were TSTL.  The second book is MUCH better, probably the best of the three, and the third book has some good plot twists to keep you into it.<br /><br />And the juicy bits, yep, they're as juicy as you've heard they are.

B0058EBNAO|5.0|I waited until I got my new Nexus 7 tablet to get this app because I thought it would look better than any of the other weather apps I was using. I was right! Several features set it apart. It also does not require unreasonable permissions to use.<br /><br />I look for three things in my weather app: accurate detailed weather information, good graphics that function well, and apps that respect my privacy by requiring only the permissions they need to operate.<br /><br />So that you can understand why I prefer eWeather HD, here are comparisons to the three other weather apps I was using:<br /><br />ACCUWEATHER PLATINUM -<br />Accuracy: Data and forecast are accurate enough to be useful most days. 10 day forecast provides detailed information about each day. Lifestyle information is mostly frivolous.<br />Appearance: Clear but very basic presentation of information. The radar imaging is okay, but the map won't zoom and is very basic (on my son's Kindle - I can't get a version from Amazon that is compatible with the Nexus 7, so I can't say how it looks on that.) No adjustable font size.<br />Privacy: When I realized just how many permissions it requires, I deleted this app from my phone. It does not need to send SMS and email messages, make phone calls, and modify my calendar without my input. The rest of the permissions are needed.<br /><br />BEWEATHER AND WIDGETS PRO:<br />Accuracy: Information and forecast are usually pretty  close, but when I got up this morning it insisted it was 96 degrees out. I switched to another reporting station and it was 71. Much better. No details besides hi/low, humidity and sky conditions on the 10 day forecasts. I need to know about wind in advance. Supports multiple locations.<br />Appearance: The data screen is clear and pretty and largely empty. I like that I can adjust the font size. I prefer my information in a more graphic presentation. The radar map functions well and lets me zoom by pinching.<br />Privacy: Only necessary permissions are required.<br /><br />WEATHERBUG ELITE:<br />Accuracy: Data is among the more accurate for our area. Gives good level of detail, including hour by hour for the days in the extended forecast. No wind info, though.<br />Appearance: NOT designed for tablets - takes up about half the screen. Presentation of information is well designed. The radar imaging is good, but the map graphics are basic and lack any detail. I can pinch to zoom, which is good.<br />Privacy: Only necessary permissions are required.<br /><br />EWEATHER HD, RADAR HD...<br />Accuracy: Data from the Intellicast service is among the best for our area. I have not tried the European based service because Idaho is in the US. It's useful that I can track information in several locations just by scrolling the screen up or down. Best level of detail for each day in the 10 day forecast and good graphics to communicate it.<br />Appearance: Definitely the best I have found. It is designed for tablets, works well on my Razr Maxx too, and lets me adjust the font size. The graphic presentation of information is clear and concise. Daily forecast is both graphic and in text. The map of current conditions is useful, and the radar map graphics are the best I have seen. The earthquake info is interesting even though we don't get many quakes here.<br />Privacy: Only necessary permissions are required.<br /><br />My conclusion: eWeather HD has all the information and details I want in a well organized and visually beautiful format. It functions well, conveys the data through good graphics as well as text, and looks fantastic. None of the other apps I have used are nearly as good. Even better, the developer is very responsive, so when I had a problem (the app wouldn't download), he responded very quickly.sions are required.<br /><br />WEATHERBUG ELITE:<br />Accuracy: Data is among the more accurate for our area.

B002DQDV6Y|4.0|Harry potter never gets old.  I have watched all the movies at least 4-5 times but the magic never ends.  It is fun to go back and watch the earlier movies and see Daniel ratliffe and the others as little kids and then watch them grow up again through the movies.
B005K17RU0|3.0|its always on hogging the ram on my kindle. even tried using an app killer but still on. no option in the settings either.
B000002GA8|3.0|Rick Wakeman is an amazing talent... He is without a doubt considered one of the best keyboard players in rock... This album shows why... The orchestra along with Wakemans playing sound excellent overdubs & all... The problem I do have with this album is of course the singing along with the narrator's voice which is a common gripe with most fans of this album... But I must say the effort that was put into this album for its time is top notch... This type of music is not going to appeal to everyone but it is definitely worth a listen if you are a Wakeman fan... If you do end up deciding to get it I would suggest you try getting your hands on a copy of the Japanese smcd
B000SSPL2Q|5.0|Maybe.  As the cd era shows signs of drawing to a close (at least all the pundits seem to say so) the record labels are trying to get as much mileage from their back catalog as possible.<br /><br />So we're seeing amazing deals on classical box sets from DG, Philips, Decca, Mercury, etc.<br /><br />I have bought a lot of these box sets, but this is certainly my favorite.  I've been a Sibelius fan for 30 years and have owned many recordings of these works.  Until now my favorite has always been the Colin Davis cycle on Philips with the Boston Symphony from the mid 1970's.<br /><br />But this set takes the crown.  Wonderful performances, great sonics, this is just a terrific collection.  Highest recommendation.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|E.L. James did an amazing job! The story, as well as the first two, is well written. This book had the perfect ending for Christian and Ana, in my opinion. I enjoyed their story very much. I would have like to see more in the ending of the book though.<br /><br />*Destiny*

B0054JZC6E|4.0|like it but a little to much effort to make it to the higher games and requires you to play the same games over and over untill you have enough to unlock one more game
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I don't even feel like I'm capable of writing a review for it having seen it only one time.<br /><br />There's so much going on in the film, and it's so hard hitting in an emotional sense, it Was hard to even grasp all of the more subtle nuances of the film. It's one of those movies you feel more than you necessarily comprehend.<br /><br />The movie very much mirrored it's villain; it's a beast. Massive, overwhelming, and unrelenting. The various subplots and character arcs of the film all intertwine and come together in an incredibly satisfying way ultimately - and pretty much every single cast member turns in a memorable performance with great emotional resonance.<br /><br />If it has one downfall, it may be that it's a little TOO big and monstrous to fathom at times, and I'm guessing many fans will come to enjoy TDK more purely because it's a bit simpler, less emotionally taxing film. But TDKR is very much the summer extravaganza done right. It's what Transformers 3, or The Matrix 2&3 or POTC 2&3 SHOULD have been, it improves upon what's already been done in HP and the Deathly Hollows and, most strangely, it both compliments and contrasts Avengers in every sense of the word - It's the ting to TA's yang, it's the night to TA's day, and thats really cool to see; for one superhero movie to elevate another to even greater success.<br /><br />I need to see it again. I need explore Bruce's character arc and journey a little bit more in depth. I need to let the shocking power and viciousness of Bane sink into my skull a little bit more. I need to gain a better grasp on the plot structure and exactly how each subplot ties into each other, and most importantly, I need to really explore what TDKR is trying to say socially, individually, and about the superheroes in general.<br /><br />Overall though, I'd say at least a 9/10 or 10/10. If its not the best movie of the year, it's the second best (I do love Moonrise Kingdom), and it will most assuredly go down as one of best movies - and possibly best superhero movie - ever made.
B004LWZWGK|2.0|I am a HUGE Batman fan and had nothing but excitement in mind when I saw the previews for this. Unfortunately, Christopher Nolan decided that the worst movie he ever made would be his third Batman film. What went wrong? (No major spoilers here...if you've seen the \\"I'm Gotham's reckoning\\" previews for the film you know as much as I'm going to share)<br /><br />1. No Batman. You are 45 minutes into the film before you see Batman for the first time. After that, he's in and out for a grand total of about 25 minutes of screen time in costume. In the third film of a trilogy about Batman, this is pathetic.<br /><br />2. A boring villain. Yes, Heath Ledger is dead and it would have been a mistake to try and replace him, but to decide you've had a charismatic villain in the previous film so it's time to go with a plodding boring one in Bane for the second is stupid. Everything that made \\"The Dark Knight\\" interesting is lacking here. And thanks for deciding to make Bane's voice so hard to understand. It's just like in the comics...no, wait, it's not anything like the comics. It's just a stupid plot contrivance to be artsy. Oh, and the whole \\"rich people are evil\\" plot point was unnecessary.<br /><br />3. The sudden introduction of a major character for convenience's sake. Remember in the third Lord of the Rings movie where Sam picks up Frodo and carries him the final steps to Mordor? Now imagine if we'd never heard of Sam before the third film, and suddenly he has more screen time than Frodo. Nolan decides to conveniently take Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Lucius Fox, and even Batman out of the film through one circumstance or another and put all the focus on a brand new set of characters we don't know or care about. Yes, Blake was an interesting character...but he should have been in all three films if he was going to be that important. And if you haven't figured out who he really is within the first 15 minutes of the movie you aren't trying.<br /><br />4. The plot. Trying to combine \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\", \\"Knightfall\\", and \\"No Man's Land\\" into one film seemed too grand...and it was. He should have taken something like \\"The Long Halloween\\" or even just ONE of his three choices and made it a movie.<br /><br />The only plus in this is Catwoman. Anne lights up the screen when she's there with the missing action and charisma we get from absolutely no one else. She needed Blake's screen time though.<br /><br />All in all, I was incredibly disappointed. Yes, I understand the whole thing was \\"Batman is human\\"...but why in the world did Nolan decide the way to end his trilogy was to make it this horribly plodding film that should have had at least 30 minutes cut out of it. I'm sorry to see DC's movie franchise falter like this after Green Lantern. They just can't catch a break.<br /><br />If Nolan comes back for another Batman film, I'll give him another chance and definitely watch it. I mean, seriously, it couldn't get much worse than this.o combine \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\", \\"Knightfall\\", and \\"No Man's Land\\" into one film seemed too grand...and it was.

B004LWZWGK|5.0|**Spoilers Below**<br />This movie is really hard to put into words really. The amount of different emotions I felt during the movie almost brought me to tears. Christopher Nolan has done it again. First I'll go through the new actors/characters and how I felt about them: I've never \\"loved\\" Anne Hathaway but she a fine job as Selina Kyle/Catwoman. Her personality and attitude were spot on. Tom Hardy as Bane was just flat out awesome. He was such a brute yet he was so evil and intimidating. I think the creepy voice helped, too. It's not Heath Ledger/Joker level, but pretty darn close. Marion Cotillard was great as Miranda Tate/Talia al Ghul as well. Out of all the new actors, I honestly loved Joseph Gordon-Levitt as John Blake the most. He impressed me very much. He was an integral character in the movie and you could say he was practically Batman's sidekick (hint, hint). Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, and Morgan Freeman are great as always.<br /><br />The length of the movie might bother some people, as it runs for about 2 hours and 45 minutes,but it didn't bother me at all. The pacing was good and there was never too much action or never really any meaningless scenes of dialogue. The plot was interesting, emotional, suspenseful and engaging. You could almost say this was more of a sequel to Batman Begins than The Dark Knight due to the major tie-ins of the League of Shadows and Ra's al Ghul. Harvey Dent is mentioned throughout the movie as well and is used very well in relation to the plot, in my opinion. This film is packed with to the brim with emotion. Whether I was seeing Batman/Bruce Wayne struggling to climb out of the prison, Bane taking over the city and having all the people in panic and fear, or Alfred leaving Bruce I definitely felt what most people feel when you watch great moments in great movies.<br /><br />What I've always loved about the Christopher Nolan Batman movies is that you don't have to like Batman to like these movies. I am, however, a big Batman fan. The sense of realism, intelligence, fear, sadness, struggle and action that permeate throughout these movies is just impossible to ignore and should be embraced by all movie lovers. In 1997 Batman & Robin almost killed Batman off forever in the realm of films. Christopher Nolan brought it back with Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises over the period of seven years and they will never be forgotten. Greatest Trilogy Ever? Greatest Trilogy Ever.<br /><br />4/4 Stars
1936608898|5.0|I've read several books on Paleo, and It Starts With Food was the best in terms of relaying information in a clear, concise, understandable way. Melissa and Dallas really come across as normal people who understand the difficulty of dealing with food issues when going Paleo, which makes the book so much easier to read and apply. They never come across as preachy and genuinely seem to REALLY want to help people. I've let several friends borrow the book and they all said the same sort of things.<br /><br />It's a great book and I think you'll enjoy reading it and using its information to better your diet and life.

B006AZZPCM|5.0|I love the ability to download youtube videos.  I'm ok with having my youtube videos be a day late in exchange for not having to buffer, not lose the video cache when I switch apps, the ability to listen to videos and save the screen consuming energy, watch videos in subways, quickly skip ahead.....<br />This program has rarely disappointed me.<br />The only sucky thing is that navigating videos uses a basic web page which requires you to click on links to show more recommended videos.  When you're downloading a bunch of videos in a row and going back to your main subscriptions page you may need to click on the \\"show more videos\\" link over and over again.
B005WYFLNU|4.0|Con:  That the girls are in a fixed scene.  You can't have a cut out of the girl and dress them.  I wish the scenes didn't include the girls, but were just scenes, and the girls can be applied to different scenes.<br /><br />Pro:  Keeps girls occupied for hours.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Pornographic Mills and Boon, in my opinion, and I stopped reading Mills and Boon before I grew out of my teens! Virgin meets drop dead gorgeous Billionaire, whose grey flannels hang perfectly from his hips, throw in some repetitive sex scenes, and that's about it. I did keep reading because I had paid for the book, and I hate to give up on something I've spent money on. I was also hoping it would get better. I ended up skipping huge sections though. I won't be reading the follow ups to this book. I prefer a book with a little more substance to it.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is the worst book I have ever read--it was so bad I couldn't finish it. Thankfully someone has already calculated the number of times the characters use words like \\"crap, double crap, triple crap\\" and \\"inner goddess.\\" The adolescent word choice was probably the most offensive part of the book, followed by the slow story, and the shallow stereotypes. Though I love the environment, I'd rather burn this book than give it to Goodwill.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|All of the stories about the prince meeting his princess and living happily ever, of course after a few bumps in the road, have been worn out. Everyone, from live action to animation companies, have taken these stories and run with them in every direction possible and yet they still try to come up with \\"new\\" ways of making movies with them. Enough already!<br /><br />Here is a relatively new company on the market that is making quite an entrance onto the scene. They didn't use any conventional story line, didn't follow any cheesy pre-set outline, didn't think they had to fit into a pre-determined mold and because of that, they ended up with a great movie that children will be rolling on the floor in laughter throughout, and the adults will be doing the same! I know I pull out this movie when there are no kids around to get a good laugh and just enjoy myself.<br /><br />Despicable Me may be labeled as a children's movie, but that doesn't mean grown adults can't watch it without children and have a blast. There are plenty of jokes throughout that adults will understand and stunts that they will think are funny. Even after seeing the film close to a dozen times, I still laugh at the same things.<br /><br />And to me, that's what helps bolster the success of a children's movie: relatability to adults and giving them something to enjoy throughout the film.<br /><br />So, grab some kids or some coworkers or neighbors or just have an evening with yourself and get ready to loosen up a bit and laugh. It's hard not to enjoy a good comedy, and these folks did it right.

B008MEM24S|1.0|it wouldn't download!! I have a kindle fire and it doesnt work. I clicked the 99c bottom and I don't know if I bought it or not so PLEASE HELP
B008MEM24S|4.0|Really fun and some great new twists! A must play if you like &quot;Where's My Water?&quot; and are a Phineas &amp; Ferb fan!
B004EPZ08E|3.0|I purchased this format of the film because I have a BluRay player, everyone else I know has a DVD player, and I like to watch movies on my Mac devices (Apple TV, iPod, computer, etc.). Like pretty much everyone else who has mentioned their dissatisfaction with the Ultraviolet digital download, I too was frustrated by Flixster and the whole setup. I went to the Flixster/ultraviolet support site [...] and filed a new ticket (under request support) stating how I couldn't play this in iTunes and how frustrating it was! They immediately sent me an email saying that if I sent my address, they would send me a download disc that would work with iTunes. I've read in forums that many other people have had success with this method, too, and so while it is a pain, I recommend taking the time to file a complaint! Plus, the more people who express their frustrations, the likelier it will be that something will change.  :-)    As for the movie, I loved it! I thought it was great. Giving a 3 star review on the overall product, though, because I watch movies through digital downloads the most, and this Flixster business is a pain!
B008MEM24S|5.0|I'm in love with Perry and this game was only for ipods then us! I play this everday I recommend this game for all!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This game is great and a fun way to pass the time if your bored but not a game that you'd want to play all day or anything.
0812416503|5.0|I am reading this again after many years and although I know the story from the movie too, the haunting description of Mandelay and the creeping insidiousness of Mrs Danvers doesn't disappoint. The naivite of the present Mrs De Winter is masterful as Du Maurier leads us into her obsession about the first Mrs De Winter, Rebecca. The story unravels at a good pace allowing the reader to comprehend the class conventions of the time and how the present Mrs De Winter, in British terms might not be \\"top drawer\\". A great read and a fantastic story, including that famous first line.....
B008JGSM6G|5.0|good don't play yo much arm will go numbed and its fun for little kids to learn stratigraphic and matching

B007J4T2G8|1.0|The writing was horrible, there was no plot, the sex was blah, and you really hated Ana(then narrator). Ana was not very bright. She signed a contract with Grey (billionaire boytoy) to be beaten and is suprised when he actually does. We read almost half a chapter on the safe word only for her to forget it. Ana is prone to public temper tantrums, does not really have any ambiton in life outside of doing what people tell her, is a bit of a moocher (lives in bestfriend's pad rent free). Grey is supposed to be a hot twenty something but he comes off more like a creepy 40 year old home body who thinks a plane ride to Portland is traveling. He buys Ana an Audi because of its safety rating and gets turned on when she puts on her seat belt. They do not go clubbing because he cannot dance but do hang out at stuffy charity balls with his parents. Grey has no friends, you do not really know what he looks like (body tpye skin tone ethnicity ect), and he is really a downer throughout the story.<br /><br />In order to read is book you have to be willing to skip whole sections of Ana talking to herself and praising her inner goddess. Usually any reference to her thinking is a sign that you need to move on. If you see the words 'blushed' and 'flushed' on the same page its okay to skip it entirely. The characters never say anything to each other; they smirk and murmur every phrase or sentence. Before you start reading find those words and cross them out and replace them with something that sounds better. If you are reading a library copy just take it back.
B004LWZW8I|2.0|One year after Clash of the Titans and Hollywood is at full throttle cranking out action movies set in mythological Greece and before.  2011 saw the release of a remake of Conan, and this film by Indian director Tarsem Singh.  The movie follows the life of Theseus, a mortal man favored by the gods, as he leads the resistance against evil king Hyperion who is intent on freeing the Titans upon Earth.  First of, this movie bears no resemblance to the Greek myths surrounding the main character.  For those who don't know, the mythical Theseus was known for slaying the Minotaur.  No Minotaur in this movie.  However, there is a lot of bloody, gory action with swords, pikes, arrows and other weapons of hand-to-hand combat.  Some of it looks authentic but most of it looks overly choreographed.  Like just about every other Hollywood creation about ancient times, most of the key characters are played by actors and actresses from former colonies of Britain.  Is it too much to ask for Greek actors and actresses to play some of the roles?  Maybe it is.  The redeeming feature of the movie was its incredible use of colors to create an environment that looked both mythical yet fantastic at the same time.  Whether it was the grayish titans fighting the white-clothed gods amongst the brownish interior of Mount Tartarus, or the dresses of the Oracles, Tarsem Singh always delivers a visual spectacle regardless of what is happening on-screen.  For sure the cinematography looked much more realistic and plausible than in the film 300.  In my final judgement, this movie is OK to watch at home, though not really worth the purchase price of either the DVD or Blu-Ray.
0439023513|5.0|My Review:<br /><br />MOCKINGJAY picks up where CATCHING FIRE leaves off. And as the same with THE HUNGER GAMES and CATCHING FIRE, MOCKINGJAY captured me right off the bat. When a book has your emotions on one level one minute then in another minute way over on another emotion, it keeps your attention. And that is exactly what MOCKINGJAY does.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins became a very favorite Author while reading her three books. The anticipation and the drama she creates with her characters is beyond your wild imagination at times.<br /><br />Swing by and see what the question for this book is and answer it by commenting. And see the rest of my review as to why I give this book a Breath Of Life Rating of: FIVE CLOCKS!!!<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />This was and is my own book. And my honest opinion of this book.

0439023491|5.0|My Review<br />Catching Fire begins where The Hunger Games ends. And as the first Catching Fire had me from the start.<br />Once again Author Suzanne Collins' characters were so down to earth but caught up in such consequences that in some ways real life and then others so out there but you could still put yourself in their place.<br /><br />My main question for this review! Why does Katniss say, \\"The Games have spoiled even that.... There's no going back?<br /><br />So, if you would like to finish see why I give this book a Breath of Life rating of FIVE CLOCKS go to the link below.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />NOTE: I purchased this book myself.

0307744434|4.0|NO SPOILERS HERE:<br /><br />Erin Morganstern has written a wonderful debut novel, but it is not for all.<br /><br />\\"The Night Circus\\" is a romantic novel in both senses of the term: it is a tale of compulsive passion, and it is a story concerning itself with characters and events that are larger than life, a narrative of a complicated relationship between two people who are locked in a competition forced upon them by two cruel masters.<br /><br />And it is in this sense that the reviews here seem to be divided.  I think it comes down to this: if you love romance, and you are willing to be charmed, you will love this book.  If you demand more factual, detail-oriented stories, you will not care much for it.<br /><br />For the romantics out there, those who like their fantasy to be filled with rich, prosaic sentences and suggestions rather than details, then \\"The Night Circus\\" is a book for them.  The titular circus, Les Cirque des Reves, is a festival for the lonely hearts that is like no other, a world unto itself.  While within its wide-ranging tents one can find the typical elements of any circus: trapeze artists, fortune tellers, a contortionists, magicians, in this carnival there is so much more...<br /><br />But Les Cirque des Reves is a pageant of real magic, of enchantment so authentic that no two visits are ever alike.  It is a celebration of beauty and charm: where one tent might let you travel in a maze of almost infinite variation, and the next tent may allow you to recall memories of your past so vivid you will feel like you are there inside them.  And in this sense it s Ms. Morganstern who is the magician here, continually displaying her own gift at writing beautifully captivating phrases and sentences that compel the reader onward.<br /><br />But there are some readers who have taken issue with incomplete characterization, or flimsy plot developments that are light on details and depend instead upon suggestion and nuance, on creating a verdant dreaminess that doesn't work well for those who would like something more physical to sink their teeth into.<br /><br />For instance, though I enjoyed the book I did take issue with the contest itself, set up by two elderly magicians who may or may not be immortal (it's never clear) but have spent their days setting up competitions that depend upon their training of two young prestidigitators who will spend their lives attempting to one up each other to appease their masters, with no ability to end it in any other way beyond their death.<br /><br />WHY, is never really explained.  What gives them the right, one might ask, to create two sorcerers who exist in effect solely to slave away to their masters' whims, and indeed will do so for their whole lives without learning ANYTHING about the rules of the completion or the way a winner will be detected or the eventual outcome of the loser or even the slightest details about past competitions, etc., etc.<br /><br />And, though I liked the book, that particularly rankled me.  Why wouldn't either one of the main characters DEMAND to know more?  Clever writers always make their characters ask things EXACTLY SO, in order that only a certain amount of info gets out, ending the speech at a tense sentence or an adroit phrase that seems to have a particularly satisfying ring to it, even though a real conversation wouldn't do that.  Again, those who enjoy the prose and the cleverness of nuance will enjoy the book much more than those who want more meat upon their bones<br /><br />As for the construction of the book itself, the chapters are extremely brief, which is extremely satisfying and moves the story along quite quickly.  This is a bit of a chimera as well, for adjacent chapters may be a year or more apart, forward or backward in time, or even several countries apart.  It takes a while to catch on to this, and this can be a bit of a problem for some as well, as it is singularly difficult to trace a character's development through time when time itself is jumbled.<br /><br />Still, I liked \\"The Night Circus.\\"  The problems I have mentioned were not difficult for me particularly, but I have seen that they were for some of the reviewers here on Amazon.  As I've said, however,  I think it is YOUR approach to the novel that matters most.  If you're a stickler for detail, and you want to have your plots follow clear, chronological, well-defined steps, this is probably not a book for you.<br /><br />But if you like romance, and the trappings that come with it--the willing suspension of disbelief, a propensity to accept sensuality over substantive detail, a story that depends more on fantasy than fact--then you'll love \\"The Night Circus.\\"  The novel is like walking through a book-length dream.<br /><br />Morganstern is a really good writer.  I liked her world...I thought the circus sounded like a great make-believe world, a place where the quixotic would like to go, where the various tents of the circus itself offered escapes that the true romantic would like to visit...one tent is a fully realized ice garden, another is full of scents so realistic and intimately detailed that one visitor would never  experience what another would, another tent ruled over by a conjurer so talented that the real trick is not in hiding how the feat is pulled off, but in disguising that it is in fact sorcery: real magic DISGUISING itself as a clever trick.<br /><br />This is, after all, the crux of the matter.  For if you are one who does enjoy the fanciful, the ingenuity of wordplay and the actions of larger-than-life characters and events...if you yearn for the cleverness of style and syntax over carefully wrought plot points, then this novel is indeed for you.ime when time itself is jumbled.<br /><br />Still, I liked \\"The Night Circus.\\"  The problems I have mentioned were not difficult for me particularly, but I have seen that they were for some of the reviewers here on Amazon.

B0002VFXFE|5.0|Well, it worked and that's what matters most.  Unfortunately, my PS3 will only turn on again and it freezes when I try to play a game or even use Netflix.  Oh well.  Not a fault of this product...it allowed me one last glimmer of hope so thanks for that.  :-)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I totally love this game its so fun and easy I mean my friend showed me it and I totally loved it so much
0345802934|2.0|Murakami has done much, much better than this.  His characters are one-dimensional and all good or all bad.  His 'magic realism' lacks contribution to he story; dropping the phony world stuff would improve it by making the whole thing shorter, perhaps a little bit less tiring.  But then, he needs the phony world for his title, 1Q84, a mutation of 1984. Weak.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love this app. it takes where's my water to a next level. I strongly recommed this app. if the ratings went up to ten I wold give it a ten.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|This album is Epic!!!! Hands down. No contest. Underneath is one of my favorite songs- not just by Adam Lambert but by anyone. Every song is intoxicating.  By the end of one track you are left excited and anticipating the next song even on the 100th listen. I listen every day at least once and my 6 year old daughter loves Adam as well and sings along with it. This is a must buy.

B005J39FAY|5.0|This is a book I purchased for my daughter in 1988 in California.She loved it so she memorized each page with story and could recite from memory before she could read.Now her daughter is equally enjoying this lovely fun childhood story as they find each character in story to its fun end!
B007UQ5Z1G|3.0|Their first two albums are classics. if it isn't broke then don't fix it. Linkin Park really had something massive going on for them that would had turned out to be epic. But they are one of the many victims of modernization, basically does what everyone else is doing by making music that is similar to everyone elses today. Honestly the quality of general music is rapidly deteriorating. My how I miss the 'ol days. So on that note I can only give it 3 out of 5 stars, generously. There's a reason why many rock fans are dissapointed with Linkin Park and many more rock bands, and that's because they're focusing on everyone and everything else except their fans and their music.
0061689246|5.0|Such an awesome story/book. wouldn't suggest it to young adults below 13 years of age due to some sexual content and some mild language. But all in all such an amazing story:) I'm sure my children's, children will enjoy.

B005MQW5RI|5.0|MegaMind is the 2nd best criminal Mastermind, next to Despicable Me's Gru. A great family movie for all ages. The 3D Blu-Ray is outstanding! Though I only bought the Promo version of this film. I have the 2D Blu-Ray version of MegaMind and wanted to see the 3D version.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The concept is interesting and the main character of Katniss is feisty and strong, a good female heroine. The idea of the Hunger Games has depth to it from the hints about their society. The world is well developed and has possibilities that would make this story even more interesting.<br /><br />While the character of Katniss is done well, with good backstory and motivations, the other characters seem to get the short end of the straw and they seem to be there to fulfill a purpose in the development of the main character rather than being full-fledged characters of their own.<br /><br />One thing I did find a bit annoying was the heavy handedness of the symbolism.<br /><br />Overall, it is entertaining and holds the attention.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I think the resemblance is crazy. It's the exact same as Where's my Water, but with Major Monogram and Doofenshmirts talking at you!!!!<br />Point of this review, you don't have to get it, but if you do... well you'll like it. I GUARANTEE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />A.W.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I'm sure it comes as no surprise that this series is so well loved.  These books are great!!  If you need to spice up your marriage, you DEFINATELY want to read these books.  Not only that but the storyline is really good as well.  You really fall in love with these characters.

You just have to listen.

B0085776BG|1.0|Have to admit that I was only able to watch twenty seconds of it before the rancid dialog forced me to tear the blu-ray out of my player, but maybe the rest of the film is billions of times better than the first five or six lines.  If I were you, I wouldn't risk it.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a very good game. you do not need to spend real money if you are patient and take the time to allow your coins to build up. enjoy.
B008645YEE|4.0|Please be advised this is MY opinion. If this was MY movie, I would have done anything to get Howard back to complete this trilogy. Before I continue I have to say I haven't seen the movie yet. I have the soundtrack in my hands but it isn't as good as I expected it to be. I am not saying it is bad. Don't get me wrong, it is good but not best of the 3. JNH hast this melody, charming, and beautiful themes that take you to amazing places. Is he missing from this soundtrack? Yes he is. Is he missing from this movie? I don't know. Why is he missing? It was his choice (just google for \\"James Newton Howard Exclusive Interview\\" from CleverNameStudios).<br /><br />I am sorry if you were hoping to get a track by track review but this is not. It has been known that JNH was not collaborating this time so I was looking forward to Zimmer's solo work on this soundtrack. My impressions are the following:<br /><br />- This is still a Dark knight soundtrack for sure.<br />- There is recognizable themes that you will enjoy.<br />- This is a Hans Zimmer score. What do I mean? You will recognize his work, mood and his interpretation.<br />- Should you listen this soundtrack? Yes you should.<br /><br />Now, all of us have different tastes when it comes to music, so I am not going to tell you which tracks are my favorite.<br /><br />What I  want to say is: listen to this soundtrack, enjoy it (or not), go to the theater, come back and share your impressions. After years of listening to several soundtracks from several composers I can say this: it is not the same when you listen to a soundtrack before you see the movie than it is after. Lighting, mood, storytelling, characters, drama, they all come to play a part in the final editing, which is the movie itself, which we get to see in theaters.<br /><br />There is a lot of times that I get to enjoy the same tracks after I see the movie. It may be because I like to see images, I like to think images before words.<br /><br />At last, listen tothis soundtrack and share your impressions. In the end it is YOUR opinion that matters. Yes I am encouraging you to buy this CD. And yes I am encouraging you to listen to it. There is one piece missing and it is James Newton Howard. But is he missing from the movie? I will tell you in a few days.<br /><br />LONG LIVE DARK KNIGHT (from C. Nolan)!!!

B0052RCX0G|3.0|It is a shame that the graphics are so poor.  I am sure that they are dramatic in the hardbound book but on a Kindle they are almost impossible to see.  The text is all about the objects being pictured.  A real shame.  The price is very unrealistic. The hard bound book, because it contains pictures, necessarily is expensive.  However,  It doesn't seem right that the price of the ebook is inflated, since so much of the impact of this work comes from the images which the ebook purchaser doesn't get! One might as well try to find the audio version since I believe the original work was a radio series on BBC.

B006LSZECO|3.0|I didn't find this book to be much of a thriller as was advertised...seemed very slow to me!!  Not impressed!
0345803485|1.0|OK--This book is boring.  Their \\"sessions\\" are basically the same thing over and over and at great frequency.  Who can do that even in their twenties?  The dialog was worse; repetition, repetition, repetition......  Who would think a book about sex could be so boring!
0345803485|1.0|I feel like I've entered the twilight zone. Fifty Shades of Suck was by far the worst book I have ever read in my whole, entire life! I can't imagine the kind of person who would read this and actually feel good at the end...like they didn't just waste hours of their precious life on one of the most horrible books to ever be published in the history of literature. I do not get it. Maybe it's a sexless housewife thing that I just can't relate to at this stage of my life? If that's the case, may I kindly suggest you get yourselves some real erotica-lit or some straight up porn so that the rest of us who actually read books don't have to be subjected to seeing this kind of trash on the 'best sellers' list and get tricked into buying it.<br /><br />And let me be clear, I'm not calling it trash because of all the sexual content. I'm calling it trash because it started off as Twilight fan-fiction and in my opinion, ended off even worse. The writing is garbage, terriblle, repetitive and arduous. I've never seen so many instances of &#34;Oh&#34; in all my reading life: Oh my, Oh Please, Oh Please, Oh Yes, Oh No, Oh Please, Oh My, Oh My, Oh My... OH MY GOD! ARE YOU SERIOUS?!??<br /><br />And don't even get me started on the two hundred times that Ana &#34;Flushed&#34; or said &#34;Jeez&#34; in the book, because, Jeez, I tell ya, she was flushing on every single freaking page... in every encounter, in every conversation, and in every freaking sex scene! For the love of our sanity, pick up an ever loving THESAURUS!!!!!<br /><br />Then there's the fact that the author was from the U.K. and wrote a story about an American girl...stick to what you know! There were instances throughout the entire book that screamed &#34;I'm a total foreigner and grew up overseas&#34; and it was extremely distracting And annoying. And I especially loved the whole all-Hispanic-American smile thing. Honestly, what the heck does an all-Hispanic-American smile look like anyway?<br /><br />Needless to say, there was no character development to be heard of (not even with the main characters, let alone the poor, fleshless all-Hispanic-American ones). Can you say, Fifty Shades of Empty? The plot was, well, non-existent, so I'd say Ten Shades of Void is quite fitting, and don't even get me started on the horrendous spelling and grammatical errors throughout the entire book...One Shade of Dictionary anyone? Wait, what's that you say? My play on the title is annoying? Well, jeez, get used to it because the &#34;author&#34; does it throughout the entire book. So. Fun.<br /><br />All in all, it was an absolute brutal read for me. So bad that I found myself skipping entire paragraphs just to get through the thing, but at that point, the only thing that held my interest even remotely was the BDSM scenes (and that was ONLY because I've never been exposed to it and was curious what all the hype was about) but even THAT got tiring and uneventful after reading about it on every ten pages.<br /><br />I truly can't imagine who would have the audacity to publicly praise this book, and do it with a straight face. It's a sin against literature if I ever did see one.<br /><br />If you want my advice on this book, spare yourself the pain and pick something else.o be heard of (not even with the main characters, let alone the poor, fleshless all-Hispanic-American ones).

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Although different from the first two books, this book is beautiful and well-written, as is Collins' ought. It wraps up the series nicely, and doesn't leave the readers wondering if there will be more books, but somehow, we still wouldn't mind them.
B0025X4P24|4.0|The album starts terribly, with Vanessa's lazy vocals sometimes making \\"breathless\\" sound like \\"breathlesh\\". And it doesn't get any better before \\"The Real Thing\\", where her great singing lifts an ordinary Stevie Wonder song (am I allowed to say that?). \\"Close To You\\" is a nice tune with a classy arrangement, and she is more than equal to it,with her final whisper sealing the deal. And the next tune, \\"I Fell In\\", is the best thing on the album.<br /><br />\\"October Sky\\" goes through the motions, helping give duets the bad name they often deserve. \\"Come On Strong\\" is another lazy vocal, but is followed by the nice closing track, \\"If There Were No Song\\".<br /><br />What I really love about Vanessa is her refusal to use excessive vocal ornamentation. She proves that when you've got the voice, a pure sustained note, with occasional controlled vibrato, is far more emotionally effective than the ridiculous uncontrolled melisma employed by so many singers today. They have no self-confidence, and over-compensate with more notes than are necessary. Vanessa must be a very secure and grounded woman.
0375869026|5.0|Judging a person by his or her looks is commonplace in our society, despite exhortations to the contrary.  When middle-school-aged August Pullman attends public school for the first time, he'd love to be known for anything other than his face, which is rather out of the ordinary as a result of serious birth defects.  His friends know that he loves \\"Star Wars\\", playing with his dog, and just having fun...but his other fellow student know him only as the boy with the ugly face.  Palacio has a good sense of how kids think and feel, and does a wonderful job of showing both the cruelty and the compassion of human beings.  In the end, she makes a strong case for kindness, without speaking condescendingly.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|so fun! so freegin hard lmao. i really like this game. colorful and very strategic. i play as much as i can.
0553801473|5.0|It is not that all of the criticisms in the posted reviews are erroneous, it is just that this installment and the over arching story of the series are utterly amazing notwithstanding the validity of some of those criticisms.  Yes, the storyline is highly complex and has innumerable characters.  Yes, I am concerned that I might die or, more likely, that Martin might die before the whole series is completed.  Yes, the wait for the next installment is likely to be insufferable.  And yes, to a whole host of similar criticims.  SPOILER ALERT But at the end of the day, none of that seems to matter when Daenerys -- after almost 5 full volumes of anticipation -- mounts Drogon and rides him out of the fighting pits.  That scene, and probably another 20 stunning scenes in the book, make me not care an iota about all of the other issues.  This is grand saga storytelling of the highest order.  If Homer were alive, he'd be impressed.

0099579936|1.0|So many people talked about and recommended this book and now I wonder who I am surrounding myself with. What a waste of time and money. This review probably isn't helpful, it will lack the details and many reasons why you should save your money and says more about my choice in friends and being a follower. I always read recommended books since I love reading and thought any book would be a good book, at least a decent book. Well, I was wrong, learn from my error and save your money.

Amazing detail and incredible likeness of actors, sets, costumes, landscapes mountains and terrains. Never in our lives have we seen this motion picture jump out at us. What a fantastic Blu-ray product! The music box was my wife's favorite. Plays \\"Favorite Things\\" over and over again. Will purchase again from this seller. Excellent service, great job.
B000VECAC6|5.0|It's true that this doesn't make fun of Jesus. In fact Jesus (if he actually existed -there is not an inkling of proof he did) was probably an admirable political figure fighting against Roman Imperialists (oh the irony you religious American right wingers).This film sums up the ignorant times so brilliantly, with the numerous versions of Christianity based on much earlier beliefs, all fighting with one another as is the case with Islam now but 600 years later. Religious freaks please spend a few hours to read Bart Erhman, Richard Dawkins, Chris Hitchens and Sam Harris etc. and you may see the reality of things and save much time being offended. Oh yes, and this is a brilliant, absolutely hilarious film.
B000Y0Q66I|5.0|Wonderful episode. Wasn't the most cool or action packed but the characters were all so great; except for COL Mayborn. SG1 saved the day just in time and we also got to see a young girl who really turned out to be a hero in the end!

0062183591|5.0|Behavioral psychology is a popular topic for non-fiction books today, and it often seems that what can be observed has already been observed.  Everything from confirmation bias to loss aversion to anchoring is covered in numerous wonderful tomes of anecdotes and studies that demonstrate the irrational ways human beings act contrary to what we would expect.  With such a body of work by Ariely and others, I wondered how this book could tell a new story.<br /><br />I was not only pleasantly surprised but excited to discover that Ariely has broken new ground, this time discussing dishonesty, specifically why we cheat  and how we justify it to ourselves.  Ariely is not talking about con-men or compulsive liars, but the little lies everybody tells throughout their lives.  While he starts with the story of Enron, he suddenly makes it clear how these lessons apply to everyday life.<br /><br />Through what he calls the SMORC or Simple Model of Rational Crime, he comes up with a metric to measure just how dishonest we actually can be.  The fascinating thing he discovered is that you can quantify dishonesty.  Most people don't want to outright lie, but they are willing to \\"stretch the truth\\" by a small by definitely measurable percentage when they think nobody is looking.  Through studies using self-graded math tests, Ariely could ascertain in numerous different circumstances just how honest people would actually perform.  Ariely even discusses self-deception, or how when the circumstances are right, we can lie to ourselves.<br /><br />The book is not full of jargon or technical speak.  As with most in the genre, it is light-heartened, entertaining, and fun to read.  You will discover as you read places you might be engaged in active self-deception, and awareness of these acts is the first step towards righting them.  In fact, much of behavioral psychology focuses on things we do without even realizing it.  But through realization, we can start to fix these problems.  In that, Ariely's book is not only an interesting and entertaining read, but a good start in self-improvement for everybody who sometimes fudge the truth.Ariely's book is not only an interesting and entertaining read, but a good start in self-improvement for everybody who sometimes fudge the truth.
1574216988|5.0|I received three Zentangle books from Amazon yesterday. Usually it takes me quite a while to offer a review after receiving a book. Not with the two Sandy offered. This and \\"Totally Tangled,\\" are \\"Must Have's,\\" whether you are new to tangles or are an experienced designer. It is a juicy adventure in Tangletown. Sandy provides a large variety (100ishka?)of tangles and ideas for their use in a wide variety of venues. Her guidance is impecable. You can't miss following her lead. it is a gentle exploration of the possibilities for you to ponder and execute wherever and whenever you wish. Slip it into your purse with a Micron pen and paper and you're set for an adventure in personal creativity. Enjoy the bounty. It's a wild ride to relaxation and contentment with a huge dose of fun. Very good things come in this little package!

At first glance you may think oh no this is too much, but actually for someone who hates to cook I have greatly enjoyed both the making of the included recipes and have enjoyed the happiness my grandson has found in cooking and eating some of the treats we have made together.

0316023744|3.0|This is generally a good book that is well researched and fairly presented, but there are a few shortcomings worth pointing out. The narrative at times loses steam and is reduced to reporting which generals reached which river with which division on which date. General readers will wonder what the significance of these events are and military buffs will wonder why the type of equipment and weaponry used are never discussed. Beevor keeps most of his attention on the battlefield which may disappoint readers looking for a more comprehensive treatment of a global military/political/economic event, and his chapter on Yalta is an excellent example of how good this book could have been had he chosen to broaden his focus a bit. Other decisions, such as devoting pages to Hitler's final days in his bunker but only a few paragraphs to Hiroshima/Nagasaki are questionable.<br /><br />I think this book is on par with Penguin's History of the Second World War. Penguin's volume has better maps, a broader focus, and does a much better job of addressing the causes and consequences of the war. It is also much longer though and separates the European and Pacific theaters into separate parts. I strongly recommend Rick Atkinson's series for readers wanting a battlefield narrative from an American perspective.

B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Shania Twain once said in an interview that as an artist it is very important to have music that stands the test of time for all fans to enjoy. This testament couldn't be truer for her \\"Greatest Hits\\" CD that was released in 2004.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I devoured this book with an appetite so far beyond famished that I grin sheepishly as I FINALLY review one of the best books I have read in a very VERY long time. *contented sigh*<br /><br />It's hard to let go of truly impactful characters who take you through a plethora of emotion. I felt somewhat discombobulated, distraught, electrified, and madly in the deepest bowels of affection for those involved as I read Travis and Abby`s story. I was, by all accounts, right there with these two uniquely beautiful characters as they navigated their way through heartache, pain, betrayal, identity stereotypes, friendship, and yes, finally love.<br /><br />The secondary characters lend validity to our Hero and heroine's plight as they come to terms with not only who they identify themselves as being but also what they represent together as a unified front. America and Shepley offer insightful secondhand commentary as part of \\"the circle\\" that is at times surreal and thought provoking. I know I'm rambling but I digress...<br /><br />Onward with the review:<br /><br />So what is all the hype about you ask? Well, for starters, there's Travis 'Mad Dog' Maddox. Bad boy extraordinaire. He's tattooed, drives a motorcycle, has repugnant taste in non-committal one night stands, has a cousin, Shepley, who shares an apartment with him (and also provides much entertainment as the `voice of reason` at times), drinks way too much than is otherwise healthy, and oh yeah fights hand to hand boxing/combat style at Eastern University's super secret underground \\"Circle\\". Throw in a bet and a girl by the name of Abby Abernathy that makes it a habit to \\"blend in\\" while also battling her own inner demons and we've got ourselves an angsty epic love story that leaves the reader laughing and crying throughout its entirety. Good right? *smirk* Yup.<br /><br />Ok, so Abby, Abby, Abby...where to start. Abby Abernathy our heroine and `transplanted Kansan' is the girl who meets the boy (Travis Maddox) while attending one of the secret fights at Eastern U. She's out of her element which is expertly described in the first chapter of the story by way of her pre-fight attire. Can anyone say pink cashmere cardigan and pearl earrings? Wow, who woulda thunk...<br /><br />From there, literally the first paragraph, the story takes off on a non-stop ride between the two main characters. A bet is initiated and accepted and convoluted misinterpretations ensue. Without spoiling the story for those of you who haven`t read it, and without writing too much of the plot as is warranted, I leave you with this. Buy. The. Book. Go to the library and borrow it if you have to. But read it already! I ensure you that you won't be sorry.<br /><br />In a day and age where college and sex are synonymous Jamie Mcguire brings us a story that encompasses so much more than the epitomized stigma that college students face today. It's a story about life and understanding the relationships we have with others. It's about taking the reader on a journey of enlightenment about heartache and true love. I implore everyone to read this book. It's been one of the wildest rides in literary fiction I have ever had the pleasure of discovering.<br /><br />I give this story:<br /><br />5 stars for awesomeness<br />5 stars for originality<br />4 stars for punctuation, grammar, etc. (blah blah blah)<br />3.5 stars for book front cover art ( I get the meaning behind the new cover but I liked the eclecticity of the original. And yes, eclecticity is my own made up word).<br /><br />Now it wouldn't be fair to us, the voracious reading community, if I didn't throw down some suggestions for like-minded reads. Stories with the same angst and visceral expectations as Travis and Abby's tale...so without further ado:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0064PJUWY Cutters Vs.

B007V4530A|5.0|The book delivers more than expected. Very clear and practical. All the tips given are very usefull and I am trying to follow all of them in my professional presentations.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|not just the games but trying to get more and more points just so addiciting to win more and more! !!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow free starts out easy enough for my 4 year old grandson but after a couple of levels it gets challenging for me.  This game would probably help keep alzheimers at bay. Reasoning ability required.
1606995359|5.0|This book is a treasure. I am very excited to share these stories I read as a child with my children. I read the Gladstone reprints when I was a kid until they crumbled. All I could think about when I finished this was, \\"When can I get my hands on the next volume?\\" Buy this and the Donald Duck Carl Barks and you won't be disappointed.[[ASIN:1606994743 Walt Disney's Donald Duck: \\"Lost in the Andes\\" (The Complete Carl Barks Disney Library)]]
1591844096|4.0|This book is a dynamic reference for everybody that works for somebody else. It will remind you that you are talented and fully capable of bringing a different set of your own skills to the unit, team, family, or organization. The author kept me motivated to keep reading, to write my own guide, and promote him, and his inspiration with all my contacts. I even bought my self that little piece of hardware for about 69 cents called a \\"Linchpin.\\" Now, it's time for me to keep the wheel on the wagon.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so addicting, I have trouble putting it down.  It works your brain but is also kind of... what's the word... cathartic.  Some people are commenting that it's too easy or not challenging enough so they uninstalled it... they just didn't have patience. I didn't have difficulty until halfway through the 8x8 board, then I came across one that took me a few days to figure out. Love the water sounds too.<br /><br />Works great on my Kindle Fire and my Samsung Galaxy II Epic 4G Touch.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really enjoy this game. Its fun and entertaining. Its easy to move forward without losing your interest. It teaches your children how to care for a family and what its like to run a community. Very captivating.
B00881VLCE|3.0|Nice little app for Kindle Fire. Once again a fast easy app to do while waiting in  a Dr. office my grandchildren enjoy it also
034580404X|5.0|Great book from the first book to the last. Recommend highly to those who like love mystery action and much more. Defenetly going to the movie when it comes out.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|object search, spot differences, and mini games. this game has variety and with great graphics it really is a fun game.
B0059XTTW8|1.0|Imagine a remake of Goldfinger with someone else playing james Bond instead of Sean Connery. That is exactly what you get with Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy because the definitive version of this book adaptation already exists. The six part TV miniseries filmed in 1979 starring Sir Alec Guinness as George Smiley is not only thee only version of the book worth watching on film it is the ONLY one the author truly loves (buy the 3 DVD set and listen to Le Carre say so in the interview).<br /><br />Not only did the '79 adaptation capture the best elements of Le Carre's novel without it feeling boring and talky, Alec Guinness literally took over the role of George Smiley. In fact, Le Carre found himself thinking of Guinness as Smiley while writing the third novel in the trilogy (Smiley's People).<br /><br />With such an established masterpiece adaptation of a great novel, WHY DID ANYONE BOTHER TO REMAKE IT???? Adding insult to injury, this remake is hardly faithful to the original novel which irritates established fans of Le Carre's work like myself. Bearing this in mind, WHO DID THEY MAKE THIS FOR ANYWAY?????<br /><br />DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND BUY OR RENT THE SIX PART '79 VERSION STARRING ALEC GUINNESS AND TALK THAT MASTERPIECE UP INSTEAD OF PRETENDING THAT THIS MOVIE IS GOOD BECAUSE IT'S NOT.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|Just started playing, seems enjoyable, moderately engaging puzzles.  Still little small on smart phone to see everything but not too.bad.
B0077PBPJ6|4.0|While this film adaptation of Sebastian Faulks' Birdsong is not perfect, I think it successfully captures the feel of the book. The novel was something I found myself really wanting to like as I read it (a few months before I watched the film), but the main character, Stephen Wraysford, kept me at a distance for much of the story. The film feels quite the same. I was not happy with the casting of Eddie Redmayne at first, as he did not physically match my and most people's idea of Stephen, but by the end of this two-part TV movie he had won me over (the war scenes are where he really shines), just as Stephen did in the book. The novel now stands as one of my favorites, despite its flaws.<br /><br />This is not a perfect adaptation (it tends to reveal the book's flaws rather than patch them up - the seemingly instant yet deep romance, for example), but I think for the most part the changes and omissions it made were for the better (those who have read the book will know what I mean). I wish there was a bit more screen time devoted to Jack Firebrace's part of the story, but the ending still made me cry, and not just because the book did.<br /><br />If you like the book, I think you'll like this adaptation, provided you can tolerate the small changes. If you didn't like the book or were annoyed with certain parts, those same things will probably bother you in film form.
B005HSL626|1.0|I hats this app all u so is cut fruit .why don't u just get unplugged and slice up some healthy fruit and make some fruit salad. everyone who plays this game needs to get off the rear end and excersize. g&reg;@&copy;&euro;
B004AFFZNI|5.0|I have a bunch of GoPros that I use on a bunch of shoots I do. This case is great for streaming live video from the camera to a receiver while still keeping the camera protected, granted you have the equipment to do that. I use this case inside airplanes streaming live cockpit video straight to the ground.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Great insight to secrets of successful runners. Found it educational as well as entertaining. Had stopped running for a while and this got me back on track reminding me of the joy of running.
B004I4H8QS|5.0|Layla and other assorted Love Songs is one of my all time favorite Rock recordings.  The 40th Anniversary edition is a GREAT set, the first disc is the complete remaster and just sounds fantastic.  The second disc includes live tracks, alt master recordings, and will bring a big smile and fond memories of your/our past.  The Domino's lineup is timeless and these songs are as STRONG as ever and will always stand the test of time.  Fire this recording up at your next party/gathering and really get things jumping.  Listen, ENJOY!!!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Beware that part of collecting animals &amp; buildings etc. costs real money...in this case currency is in 'acorns.' Great fun playing building your own town. Very addictive... Ihighly recommend this game to adults and kids alike!
B00785P2QC|4.0|For a free game it is pretty fun. Its really difficult to get through all of the challenges without purchasing credits.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|After completing the Fifty Shades Trilogy, I must say that Fifty Shades Darker is my favorite. E. L. James is an exceptional author. My hope is that she continues the story by now exploring Elliot's issues and when she's done with Elliot, she can go on to Mia. I would definitely read anything this author has published. The Fifty Shades is a powerful story. It's a shame that everyone talks about the BDSM and not how this is truly a story of healing.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Two thumbs up. Better than a majority of similar games out there.  Like that you can advance without a lot of friends.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game really is fun,  though sometimes it has glitches like all games will. Sometimes the downloading to go to friends takes awhile or never happens, there is only about three ways to get nuts and one of them, buying, I cant do and it takes awhile to get any from the Scratch game and from the snow piles.  My t -rex disappeared on me and I didn't sell him plus its not letting me sell any of the animals anyway. Addictive though but really great game! Wish there was a little bit more to it, like when Manny and Sid, etc. &quot;talk&quot; I think all of them should. All the animals in the village I mean. Something...
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Adding friends is not very user friendly and without more friends it is difficult to get what you need for many of animals, etc.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like it. its a neat app. h h h h h h h h h h j j j j j j j j j k k k k k k k k m m
B000K4X5XA|3.0|This DVD/Blu-Ray is an extended version of the original movie.  Much better. However, it was not the version I was looking for.  They added about 8 additional minutes to this version.  I actually have a longer version on VHS that I taped off of TV decades ago.  I was hoping this DVD was the same version, but it is not, so this version was a little disappointing.  But, since most of you guys haven't seen the version I have, you will probably like this version.  So, buy it.  FYI for example, the version I have on VHS has a seen at the end where Superman has to save Eve Teschmacher from Lex Luther. He was going to feed him to his Alligators, which you would have seen in another scene in the movie. There was one scene that was not in the version I have with Marlon Brando.
030758836X|5.0|People have such strong emotional reactions to this book: they either like it or they dislike it.  It is a discussion worthy book.<br /><br />What amazed me was how seamlessly the author wove in character studies while never slowing down the suspense driven plot.  Even more exciting is that I was provoked into thinking about relationships, and then of my own marriage while reading Nick and Amy's perspectives.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|There is nothing to do and no plot this app is horrible I give it a F plus:( Don't get this app!!!
B0083GPDBO|4.0|What happens when he leaves Tibet? It would appear that this is a take off of Superman. Is another one in production?
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is like a puzzle and it starts out slow and the longer you run, the faster the game goes. you really have to think on your feet.
B0076NAVNA|5.0|How come no one ever thought of pairing Morse x 2 before??? Defintely one of my favourite albums in the past few years. Just remember it's NOT an instrumental album, so don't expect one.
B008MEM24S|4.0|for adults and kids. Its so cute to see your kids reaction to seeing their favorite cartoon character in their favorote game.
B008MEM24S|5.0|this game is wonderful and challenging!! major Perry fans will love it! No problems loading on my Kindle Fire, really fun game for all!
B000MV90IU|5.0|My dad recently got the 08 mustang bullit edition car and this movie is a must have for a die hard fan. Of course its an old movie and blu ray movies show age well which isn't always good. Its still worth it and enjoyable like always.
B00006D295|4.0|First time I saw it was in 1981, at a small theater; I had managed to talk a visiting friend(s) to go with me.  The theater had some folks dressed up as \\"The Dream Police\\" (talk about a flashback!) who were actually policing the line of Rocky Horror fans.  Great kitschy movie, I have to say.  I just recently found it at Walmart for $5.00.  The extras are great, but if I have to quibble - the DVD-ROM portion does not work.  Okay, so pick at me because I like downloading screensavers and playing the silly games. The DVD-ROM portion wanted me to download/install something called \\"PCFriendly.\\"  Well, it doesn't work and any of the players to download to even attempt to get it to work are major trouble (FYI - stay away from those!).  I just want the DVD-ROM features!  Perhaps I am not computer savvy enough - sigh.<br /><br />That said, the hints on when to \\"interact\\" are great.  As for the footage of the fans, it seems hit or miss.  Some is great; some looks like just some random goof in the audience filming on his camcorder; but, I suppose if one wants to imagine what it would be like being in the audience, one could give it a pass.<br /><br />If one just wants to watch the movie and have hints when to interact? It's great! If you want an evening of silliness and can enjoy the whole kitschiness of it all, get your popcorn, newspaper, squirt guns, etc, and have a blast!
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love this game. the kids love this game cause its Perry!  I have kindle fire and it works great on it no problems at all. very much worth the .99 cents
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I pursahes this book because of all the rave. Started reading it and it is so slow and boring I wish I could demand a refund.  Do not waste your<br />Money.
B006YC74E8|3.0|So easy to use...I'd recommend it for a first time edotors..user friendly. Wow...I can't believe I ran out of things to say...lol
B007SYWFRM|4.0|very addictive!  had some problems adding friends, but the game seemed to correct itself. haven't had any problems exiting the game on my kindle unless the battery is down to 15%.
0553573403|5.0|Though I did jump on the bandwagon with this series (I watched Season One on HBO before reading this one), I did own the first four in the series for a few years before the show came out... It had been recommended to me by other fantasy-reading friends and after listening to their frustrations about the shifting dates on the publication release date for the fifth book in the series. So I decided to save myself some frustration and wait. Well, when my husband put on the first episode, I made a half-hearted attempt to stop him, and let him know I wanted to read it first... but as soon as though dire wolf puppies were found, I was hooked into the show. We watched the first season over the course of two evenings, and afterwards, I immediately dragged out my copies of the books, anxious to start reading!<br /><br />Now that I have finished the first book, that aligns amazingly well with the first series of the HBO show, [[ASIN:B008CLI3TE Game of Thrones: The Complete First Season [Blu-ray]]], I am really impressed. Not only with the series, which I loved watching, but the book entranced me as well. The most impressive bit of all was the skill put into adapting it. Lines of dialogue are pulled directly from the novel into the script, and reading it only offered more detail and prose than any significant changes from book to show. Both are totally absorbing and the characters (and, yes, there are a lot of them, but Martin does a wonderful job of making them all their own people so there isn't much confusion - and if there is, well the back of my edition has a very handy family listing for all the characters) are all well drawn and sympathetic, well except for the villains - Martin makes you really hate his villains... I can't wait to read the rest of the series!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was a great book selection. All my family and friends were reading it. When I first started reading it I couldn't really get into it. I took about 6 weeks to read the first book. Then I decided I either needed to read it or move on. Once I started to read it continuously, I couldn't put it down. REad the other two books in 1 week.
B0063GORYU|5.0|awesome<br />this card is greatness<br />this is the type of game that will keep your attention for a very long time
B008M34INW|4.0|Good to see Mel back on the screen. I thought this was a fun, entertaining movie. Intellectuals and bleeding hearts need not apply. I did not find the movie as violent as some have suggested. It's just a fun ride folks, not the Oscars. Well worth the rental.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really like this game is it simple and fun. it is the kind of game that keeps you busy for a lllooooonnnnnggggg time!!!! every time you go to quite you just want to play one more game!!
B002RUA54W|5.0|She writes beautifully. Couldn't put it down. Will read all her books. The last couple of pages resonate after you put it down .
B0083H6AQA|5.0|Whoever decided this needed to be released as a Pre-theatrical missed the boat!  Robert Pattinson was absolutely wonderful in this role.  He is a superb actor and never fails to deliver.  I would have loved to see this at the theater although my daughters 10' HD projection system did do it justice.  Highly recommend this movie  -  and I will probably purchase it when it comes out on DVD.
0812550706|3.0|We received this book from the seller way before the no later than date.  However, the book was not in good condition as promised.  I was a disappointed since this was the first time I have ordered something from Amazon that did not arrive as described. The book was very exciting and my husband, my son and myself enjoyed reading it and was anticipatory of the sequels.
B002YIHO7I|1.0|Love her voice, the band and the upbeatness of their music and maybe the years of touring and life has caught up to them on this \\"concept\\" album...feel like I have been a soldier listening to this.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love iceage because it is a social game and a some what educational I think everyone should have it
B00029LNHS|5.0|B.E.P. has produced a very fine album here, very upbeat, danceable in all ways, anthems and fun...it took a few listening to appreciate the sound but I enjoyed it.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|My friends were like Katie get this app and I would have 2 say its not on here well now it is. u don't have to b awesome @ drawing to play this game. Its also fun 2 create a custom username. everyone should get this app!!!!!

B004GYY714|5.0|I've been wanting 2 listen to Radio Disney wich u can on this app but I also found a radio station out of Australia. If u want to listen to the radio this is the app 2 do it with. BEST radio app ever.
B0061S073A|5.0|I have a 3-year old granddaughter and an 18-month old grandson.  It is nice to know that they can play without worries that they might accidentally order something!
B0086700CM|4.0|I used to play it a lot but its kind of BORING now. I don't play it any more. I thought it was ok.:)
B004I744AS|5.0|this app is easy to use. fun games are available to kill some time and learn something new...highly recommend it.
B0013ND30W|5.0|This is a great classic movie.  One of my favorites.  A prince, a princess, an evil person  what more do you need in a movie.  Ok and singing, it is a Disney movie.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I downloaded this game for my grandbabies I cant wait to share it with all of them. They will take my kindle from me. lol
B0063IH60K|4.0|it is the classic game of solitaire...I like how it gives you so many choices on everything including what background you want.
0345803507|4.0|So, liked book 1 (shocked and hooked enough to read on), loved book 2, and book 3, while it picked up in plot, got a little irritating with the redundancy in the sex scenes.  I would recommend the series to couples but just expect the boil to be reduced to a simmer by book 3.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I enjoy Flow Free tremendously.  I have Router (and Aqua Router), and have played them for many months.  So I wasn't sure what Flow Free would bring to the table that would be new.  Some have even mentioned the similarity.  However, there are (at least) two things that are different about Flow Free that make it as challenging -- or more so -- than Router.  In Router, you just need to complete the paths connecting the colored dots.  In Flow Free, you must do that -- but do it by using every square in the grid!  And, as a side point, do it in the least possible number of moves -- or you don't get a \\"Perfect\\" score.  Many times, in the harder puzzles (8x8 and larger), I'd connect all of the dots successfully -- but there were still open squares in the grid, and I needed to rethink my logic.<br /><br />The second thing is that Flow Free has a greater range.  In Router, the board is always the same size.  Sometimes there are squares that are \\"missing\\" -- i.e., you can't play on those squares; but that's the extent of the difference.  In Flow Free, you can play the (really trivial) 5x5 square puzzles, or move to 6x6, or 7x7.  Then as you master those (and it won't take long), that's when it starts to become challenging.  The 8x8 grids slowed me down; but then there are 9x9, 10x10, 11x11, 12x12, 13x13, and even 14x14 grids!  Now imagine that you not only have to connect 30 or 40 colored dots (without crossing lines); but you have to do it without leaving any blank squares!  The higher levels are tagged \\"Impossible\\", and they really are.  So you'll never run out of things to do.<br /><br />I should add that there's yet another difference to Router and other similar games -- you can play in Puzzle Mode (like the others -- you have all the time you need); or you can play in Timed Mode -- in which case, you have a fixed amount of time (that you select from half a dozen pre-determined time quantities), and the object is to see how quickly you can solve one puzzle after another in that time.<br /><br />I had no problems at all with see all of the grids on my Motorola Xoom (though I wouldn't want to try the 14x14 grids on a 3\\" phone screen!)  Nor did I have any problems with manipulating the grids, drawing the lines, etc.  I suspect that some of the 1-star ratings that had problems were possibly on lower-resolution, or smaller-screen, devices.  My eyes are too old for that; but on a 10.1\\" tablet, this game rocks.<br /><br />I am curious about one thing:  there is another app with the identical name, and the screen shots show an almost identical game.  But the \\"owner\\" is different.  How did two identical games get published by two different individuals -- and only a day or two apart?in that time.<br /><br />I had no problems at all with see all of the grids on my Motorola Xoom (though I wouldn't want to try the 14x14 grids on a 3\\" phone screen!)

0345803485|4.0|Book 1 was a little shocking - first timer for the genre but surprisingly enjoyable on many fronts.  While my initial thought was that it had little plot, it was OK with me given the other benefits of the read. However, by the end, I was emotionally attached to Ana and Grey and thus had to move on to book 2!
B005LAIGYQ|4.0|This is a good movie.  The mission/action sequences are good and for the most part realistic.  The use of actual SEALs no doubt aided with this.<br /><br />The acting is not so great, understandably if most of the lead characters are not trained actors.  During the mission sequences the actors are comfortable and the language seems to flow (probably because it is more familiar); however in the non-mission sections conversations seem very stilted, to the point where it was a bit distracting.<br /><br />Overall though, a good movie showcasing a variety of missions.
1466401885|3.0|Beautiful Disaster was a good book - one that I read very quickly.  It was entertaining but it can be summed up so quickly that it was almost too simple and predictable to be truly great.  I would recommend it for a quick,entertaining but unelightening read.
B006SHVIWS|2.0|My husband and I really loved the first Series that had been broadcast on TV here so we purchased this set.<br />First of all it's a shame that we're missing the last episode (good ol' marketing technique!) that is obviously to be purchased separately at a relatively high price.<br />Secondly, we found that both Series are incomparable! Series 1 is thrilling, with superb acting and interesting plot lines. Series 2 is ridiculous! How can people believe in such absurd story lines? Or write them at the first place? We feel very disappointed as we suspect that success has spoilt it all by imposing on the show the need for \\"more sensational\\" writing as it usually does for all creative work...
0345803493|5.0|Hooked with Book 1 but surprised myself with some emotional attachments at the end of it that left me wanting more... Book 2 was the best of the series in my view with the right mix of plot and romance.  Book 3 got a little redundant(would never have not read it given how much I enjoyed the first two).  Foray into the genre was enjoyable for me but even he my husband thought book 3 disappointed and he didn't read them.
1593272200|5.0|The depth and breadth of this book is simply amazing. It covers pretty much everything what a software engineer should know about Linux system calls, and much more. It is very clearly written, with tons of great examples and questions at the end of each chapter. This is not just a great Linux book, but probably one of the best technical book I've ever read. The editing and format of the book is also excellent - although they do exist -, I did not find any obvious errors, certainly not one that altered the understanding of a topic.<br /><br />I read it in tutorial style (i.e. linearly almost every chapter), but one could easily use it as a reference, since most of the chapters stands on their own, as all the relevant and important information is either referenced or reiterated.<br /><br />My only problem that the electronic version should have been included (just like Manning Publication's books); since the size of the book prevents you to carry it around (1500+ pages with a fairly small font)...<br /><br />After this book, I'd blindly buy anything from Michael Kerrisk.
1609611543|4.0|First off, for everyone giving this book a 1-star rating and complaining that it is just another repackaged low-carb diet... um, yeah? Not to sound too sarcastic, but I think you can tell that without having to read the book -- so maybe do 2 minutes of surface level research before purchasing a book?<br /><br />Second, to give an overview of this book, the essential message, greatly paraphrased, is that excessive carbs are not only unnecessary but bad, wheat is a carb (potentially more dangerous than all others), and it is the main carb that Americans consume; thus, we should avoid wheat and by avoiding wheat we can attain better health. More specifically, the book takes on two issues: 1) Glycemic index and blood sugar -- anyone who is familiar with the basic principles of low carb diets will be familiar with the importance of maintaining a normal blood sugar level, and 2) Gluten -- which predominately speaks to people with gluten sensitivity but is not necessarily limited to those individuals.<br /><br />Third, people need to accept that in the past few years, anecdotes and RESEARCH have continued to proliferate debunking the myth of fat and its correlation with heart disease and obesity. I'm in position to claim that there's enough research to cause a \\"paradigm shift\\" within nutrition, but there is more than an overwhelming amount of data that clearly shows carbohydrates are more significant in heart disease and obesity than fat. (Of course when you couple fat with sugar, which is almost always the case in processed, junk food -- fat always takes the blame... think about that for a second. For fun, watch the documentary Fat Head and see what happens when a man eats fast food for 30 days straight but skips the 100+ grams of added sugar from pop with each meal.)<br /><br />To wrap it all up, low carb diets are effective, but people have to realize that \\"diet\\" doesn't mean an 8 week change in eating habits to lose weight and then revert back to old eating habits. Lowcarb diets, when done correctly, do NNOOOTTTT mean MEAT, MEAT, MEAT, cheese, and extraneous fat.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|I had never heard of Emeli Sandé before seeing her album pop up as a suggestion from Amazon.  I listened to the previews of her songs, along with those of half a dozen or so other albums, and was struck by how powerful her voice was.  So, I took a chance and bought the album.  I absolutely adore it, and it has quickly become one of my favorites.  I often find myself wandering around with melodies from \\"My Kind of Love\\" and \\"Daddy\\" stuck in my head.  I have listened to the CD several times now from beginning to end and there's not a single track I skip - they're all gems.  Can't wait to hear more from her!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is great great great I love it wish there were more like it. so fun to sit and relax to.
B003O86FMW|5.0|As with \\"The Hunger Games,\\" I found myself sneaking in pages of this book at every possible free moment, then stayed up until the wee hours of the morning to finish it.  Thanks to what I felt was some clever foreshadowing, I had a decent idea of what might happen at the end, but not to the point that I felt the ending was predictable or contrived - I couldn't wait to find out exactly how it would all come together.  Book three has been purchased and I suspect I'll be done reading it by the end of the weekend!

1572814349|3.0|When I came across The Golden Tarot, I was immediately drawn to the imagery. As an art lover, I felt an instant connection to the chosen imagery along with the sumptuous colors. I though this dek would be great for me. I placed an order (which shipped and was delivered with impressive speed). Unfortunately, the deck is not what I imagined. The imagery is beautiful but I am not impressed the with quality at all. Certain figures/areas are sharper than others and the gilding flakes off with little handling. This things, to a degree, almost take me out of my readings. A shame since I was so looking forward to this deck.
B00899DR40|1.0|My brother was being an idiot so to get back at him, I strapped him down to a chair and made him listen to this album for hours.  He didn't last 15 minutes because he was declared certifiably insane and now lives in a mental institute.  That's what he gets for eating my fries.
0307956350|2.0|Well, my wife, a librarian, brought it home to me saying it was supposed to be good. By the time I read the prelude I was having doubts. By the time I was into the first chapter, I knew; I couldn't go on. This had the feel of a very poorly written piece. It was very clumsy. I suppose there must be a story in there, but for me, it felt like being at a dance with a 300 lb. klutz as my partner; it just wasn't worth it. I am quite surprised at the number of decent reviews given it by recognized critics and authors. I only can surmise they are trying to help establish a friend's career.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Love the app, simple play but challenging. The specials are fun, there are tons of levels.  Definitely addicting.  It gets hard quick.

B008MEM24S|4.0|This game is a great adaption of Where's My Water, and presents fresh new ways of playing. The difficulty is evenly balanced, and not incredibly hard. Even though games that aren't difficult might not be interesting or fun, it still is. As said before, it is still like Where's My Water, but has new features and ways of playing that keep you playing.

B0070UFMOW|4.0|The comments from those who cannot perceive a difference between an amped and unamped source should be discounted on the spot, there, I said it.  Ok, now onto the review.    The fiio E17, albeit not the prime package for this price range, does in fact improve the quality of your sound, but depending on your cans, you may not hear it.  So the first step is to get a good pair of headphones.  I use these to run my HD25's, JH5pros, D2000, ER4-S, and others, and I can hear a difference across the board.    It starts with noise. By virtue of using an amp/DAC, you are bypassing the crappy D/A on your computer, which, in my case, is a MacBook Pro.  To the guy who said that macbook pro's use good D/A's, I suggest you get your ears checked.  The noise from my 2010 13' is horrendous, and any one of my sensitive pairs of cans can pick up on it.  Noise is an extreme detriment to clarity, and by using the Fiio's D/A function, you use it's industry-leading wolfson chip instead (much cleaner signal). As a result, the noise is extremely low, and you have a very dark background to enjoy your music with.    Another reason you want an amp is so your music maintains it's Pace, Rhythm, and Timing (PRaT), to the best extent possible. Cans and D/A's with bad PRaT detract from the music experience, and oftentimes make the music sound congested and less energetic.    Clarity is another reason why you use an DAC/amp combo. Separation with the FiioE17 is way beyond anything that you can get unamped. Bass is tightened up, midrange is presented with more authority, and the highs are clear and crisp. The fact is that most sources (i.e. your computer or ipod) do not keep the ideal power requirements for music, and again, the fiioE17 fixes that, improving the immediacy of each sound wave.    In terms of the Fiio's sound signature, it's slightly brighter than an unamped source, mids are drier, and the bass is tightened considerably. Separation and spatial positioning are increased in the music, andon the whole, everything retains more detail. Again this is not to say that this is the end game for portable DAC/amp combos, because it surely is not.    I really appreciate the on board EQ feature, which allows me to tweak bass levels five levels up or down, and also treble levels the same way. However, be wary of turning up the bass, it can muddy up the sound and doesn't give music any more thump, as the upper range is more responsible for impact. This is still useful in fixing random FR peaks and valleys from your source or headphone. In addition to that, the Fiio also features a Coax and optical input option (very cool!), which, I think can both be used to play at 192/24 rates. For the conventional usb DAC, you can play up to 96/24 bit. Its pure amp function can be used via the aux port, which you can plug a LOD from your ipod for a better signal. Upsampling is usually unnecessary, but at least it can help with aliasing (hotly contested topic, I know). IF I remember correctly, it can run up to 250 ohm impedances, so look elsewhere for a more powerful amp.    The form factor is on the thick side, but can still be carried in the pocket as part of a portable setup.    Overall, I have to say it does what DAC/amps are supposed to do, and has a plethora of features to accompany it. It reduces the noise of your music, and will improves fidelity and spatial resolution. I do not have enough experience to say how it compares to others, but I can say it does the job it's supposed to.    Edit: minor clarification.    2 year followup:  This proves to be a great dj'ing soundcard and pre-amp! Very unorthodox, I know. It doesn't feature multiple outputs, but I use my computer audio port for pre-listening. Works like a charm.  The wolfson chip in the E17 is only featured in flagship pioneer and rane systems, which run upwards of $1500, so having $140 kit with the same specs is awesome.  I EQ and compress the bass in my music and this amp can solidly pump out every additional decibel of it. Who knew audiophile equipment could be used in the field!

B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl Strayed recounts her 1100 mile hike on the Pacific Crest Trail with honesty and detail. An amazing journey that she undertakes after her mother passes away, and her marriage comes to an end. Truly an inspiring tale of a young woman trying to find herself, after one too many losses in her life. This story is not just about hiking, but about the sheer determination of an extraordinary young woman, who didn't think she had anything left to lose. What she found along the way, was herself. An incredible adventure that kept me turning the pages well into the evening. Wonderful!
B004XUMPFQ|5.0|Great characters. I think I watched the series in two weeks! It's cool to see a lot of these actors in later commercially successful shows.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|Recently I heard one of the songs from Living Things on the radio, so I went on Amazon's music downloads page and got the album. It's like the old Linkin Park I used to love is back! I'll admit I was disappointed with Minutes to Midnight and A Thousand Suns, thinking \\"Where is the Linkin Park I used to love?\\", as those albums sounded nothing like the band used to. I'm a fan of the old Hybrid Theory and Meteora days, and couldn't be happier with this new album. If you liked their more recent tracks including \\"What I've Done\\" and \\"New Divide\\", then you'll like Living Things too. It's got the rock and rap mixed sounds of classic LP combined with a new infusion of electronic and synthetic beats, all creating a melodic, beautiful new LP sound. I really hope that Linkin Park keeps up with this new direction for the next few years! I definitely recommend this album!

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Beautiful Disaster is one of my absolute favorites.  The story is well written and the characters are phenomenally developed.  Who doesn't love a bad boy turned love romantic?  The description of this book is a bit hokey and initially turned me off to reading it.  Once I read the sample though, I was hooked.  I can not wait until Walking Disaster is released.

B0000027I6|5.0|I listened to this album again recently and then gave it a second and third listen. I have always liked Mr. Water's solo efforts, but this one in particular is a favourite. His lyrics are, as always, brilliant, cutting and a bit frightening. The man who gave us Dark Side, The Wall, and several other profound works does not disappoint with this offering.

B000031WBQ|5.0|Here, renowned Polish pianist Arthur Rubinstein is joined by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Fritz Reiner playing two of Rachmaninoff's most beloved music for orchestra and piano.  The disc opens with the Piano Concerto No. 2, and, what an opening!  The Concerto is marked by its technical difficulty matched with sweet lyricism, an often problematic dichotomy.  No questions asked, Rubinstein's playing is flawless, and his accompaniment is carefully measured under Reiner's baton.  Together, piano and orchestra produce wonderful music, full of excitement, flowing melodies that breath without lingering into sentimentality, and in terrific quality period sound.<br /><br />The demonic Rhapsody on a Theme by Pagaini is superb, in every way.  Rubinstein articulates each note in this notoriously challenging set of variations.  The piano sound is deep, crisp, very present.  The orchestra is in wonderful form, with biting brass, lush strings, and again, keeping wonderful pace with the soloist under Reiner's direction.  The disc closes with an earlier account of the Prelude in C minor, which is very well played, even if the mono sound leaves something to be desired.<br /><br />I can earnestly say, this is my favorite recording in my collection.  The sound is wonderful, and the chemistry between two giants of their time, Arthur Rubinstein and Fritz Reiner with his CSO, has the electricity of a live performance. The recording is historic just for those reasons, but the added bonus of the product being so enjoyable, so truthful to Rachmaninoff's scores, so invigorating, really self-recommends this item.  Outstanding by every measure; I highly recommend it.
B0007KLH1Y|5.0|I have seen my (now 7 years old) nephew play with this product for many many hours and bought this (a little prematurely) for my 4 & 2 year old kids. While they struggle to balance the blocks (considering they are so thin), the older one is starting to understand it. The machine cut smoothness surely helps (we also have 2 sets of Cityblocks colored blocks and the difference is perceptible). We are looking forward to hours of creative fun with the kids as they learn how to play with it.

0307951529|5.0|The $100 Startup is a book that calls the reader to overcome the barriers that keep them from pursuing their real desires in their personal and professional life. The book points to some common barriers that often hold us back from starting our own business including a lack of money, knowledge, or inadequate demand. However, as the book points out, some barriers we impose on ourselves can keep us from success.<br /><br />I like the fact that the book uses stories of ordinary people who have succeeded in starting their own business and offers some valuable insights on how to get started, choosing between competing ideas, pricing products based on quality, and how to create a simple but effective business plan.<br /><br />This inspirational book uses real case studies to show that it is possible to be free and to live a successful life doing what you love to do. While the book cheers on small businesses and the power of Internet, it takes a sort of vague or generic approach to entrepreneurship. The book would have been more successful had it dug deeper to show the entrepreneurs' real struggles and the steps they took to succeed.

B003VANOFY|1.0|I've had these headphones for 6 months now. They are already dying (left ear makes a ticking noise when no sound is coming through them, assuming the speaker in that ear is dying).<br /><br />From the first day I bought these I was unimpressed, they cut out often, 2-3 times for 3-5 seconds before reconnecting in a single battery charge (6 hours if using mic, 10 if not). The receiver is an arms length from my head so interferance is 0, just bad wireless signal because these are cheaply made garbage.<br /><br />The range is about the only good thing these headphones have, I can walk all through the house listening to music. But the constant disconnects (even when the usb cable is plugged in.. big w t f to that) far outweigh the range. If you're thinking about buying these save yourself the money and go to another brand.

B003OF3R0S|5.0|Okay they dress like douches but then if I judged some of the bands I grew up with by what they wore... Well I'd never have gotten in to Metal would I? It should be all about the music, shouldn't it?<br /><br />Avenged sound to me like Iron Maiden and Metallica had a forbidden love child together. That's not a bad thing in this day and age of everyone trying so desperately to recapture the sound of Nirvana or Korn or Alice In Chains and failing miserably at it.<br /><br />Why did I want to hate them other than their image? Well they stole Overkill's logo and that is just NOT COOL! You don't DO that! They didn't steal Eddie from Maiden or Rattlehead from Megadeth but Chaly is still relatively well known even by people who don't like Overkill... Not Qool!<br /><br />Anyway, the thing that sucked me in is the music. Specifically the song Buried Alive. It was on the radio and I wasn't paying much attention until it got past the solo and the next bit of music was just so freaking kewl I headbanged despite myself! Its awesome!! So I looked up some other Nightmare songs online and listened and really liked them. I don't know what they were doing before now, but this album is the shiznit!! I've bought it that week and have listened to it a dozen times since. Its worth giving them a second look if they turned you off before, they've outdone themselves on this one!<br /><br />After I got the album I did some looking into the band and found out about the dead drummer and it only makes the song Fiction all the more powerful knowing it was that kid's swan song. A more brilliant piece of piano metal would be hard to find.<br /><br />So that's my experience of AVX for ya. Now I'm debating on getting the earlier records based on this one's wow factor. Looking at the negative reactions some have to this band I'm also glad my nephew's generation has its own GNR! LOL
0425263908|4.0|This is lots of fun to read, if you can suspend your disbelief about the whole twentysomething billionaire thing, and not snicker when he says \\"Are you sleeping with anyone?\\" as his opening salvo at the beginning to their relationship. I read Fifty Shades of Grey, so I think I'm starting to get this fantasy-romance erotica genre. I no longer expect realism in the dialogue, situations or characters. I just expect great sex scenes and shameless pandering to the side of me that wishes I would have some guy say, \\"You belong to me. I won't share you\\" and the kind of thing that Gideon has a penchant for. (Not really though, right? In real life, that would have me going to get a restraining order) So if that's part of the appeal for you as well, you're in for a treat.<br /><br />Still, while I imagine Sylvia Day is busy, for the life of me I cannot imagine why it would take more than three weeks to finish the second installment and perhaps another two weeks to round out a trilogy, because it is all soooo formulaic. Instant attraction, hot sex, possessiveness and jealousy, misunderstandings and fights, make-up sex, exposure of dysfunction, emotional breakthrough, everlasting love, hot AND emotional sex, and DONE. That sounded more snarky than I intended, because I'll tell you what, the formula WORKS! I read this book and will read the next one. But I don't fool myself into thinking it is high art, and neither should you.<br /><br />Finally, I will go on record as saying that the quality of the writing in this book far exceeds the Fifty Shades series which was at points embarrassingly bad. Sylvia Day is in fact an author, and she paces her story well, and makes her characters multi-dimensional and compelling. I wish at points she did not succumb to some of the more obvious devices like endless repetition of how sexy, hot, smoldering, beautiful (insert your own word here) Gideon is. That stuff belongs in Silhouette romances, and this is a notch above that. I think readers of this kind of book can probably be trusted to remember that he's hot, beautiful, etc. if you simply describe him without the excessive adjectives. At some point, you begin to go, 'Okay, we get it, he's great-looking! Now can we get on with the actual PLOT!?' I also didn't like some of her word choices for the female anatomy. That c-word made me cringe every time I read it, and it made the sexy scenes a little less sexy and a little more crass and Penthouse-ish. But all in all, like I said, it was good fun.  Not good CLEAN fun, but fun nevertheless.this kind of book can probably be trusted to remember that he's hot, beautiful, etc. if you simply describe him without the excessive adjectives.

B0037KMHRY|5.0|Tron Legacy was an underwhelming movie.  The only thing that stood out to me afterwards--besides the visuals--was this score, which I HAD to get!  The DVD: not so much.

The \\"Fall\\" remix is my favorite.

B000FBFN1U|4.0|His series is entertaining and filled with unexpected events.  There are times when the descriptive narrative interferes with the plot lines which can be annoying.  It is also clear that he has written this to produce as many books as possible.  One would think that the 9th to 11th centuries in Europe creates the settings, with a little magic thrown in.

B002W1UEW4|1.0|Before I go into how and why I don't like this movie, I would just like to remind everyone: I know it's an action move based on a cartoon based on a toy. I know it's not fair to expect Citizen Kane here.<br /><br />Even so, the movie manages to be four degrees too stupid to bear. It still shows the strange plot structure of a movie that has been re-written too many times and never read through once. It is incoherent in a way that actually detracts from the action, the characters are thin in a way that disengages you from the movie, and the action has numerous moments that make no sense. All of this pulls you out of the movie, keeps you from staying in the moment, and makes you realize \\"wow, I'm watching a really stupid movie.\\" After you hear Scarlet give another speech about refusing to accept illogical emotions that was probably rejected by the writers of \\"The Big Bang Theory,\\" Breaker stab a dead guy in the head in the streets of Paris to retrieve his memories (which was used to bad effect before in \\"Wild Wild West\\" and \\"Fringe\\"), and Rex (a bad guy named Rex? really?) explain his evil motives, you cannot withdraw from the fact that movie is catastrophically stupid.<br /><br />The other aspect of the film that is difficult to bear is its exceedingly black heart, especially when compared to the source material that never killed anyone. During the raid on the Joes' base, the evil characters are ruthless to a degree that shocks but does not entertain, and extras are dispatched with shocking callousness that the filmmakers don't seem to notice. Zartan's taunting a woman he stabbed from behind as she dies comes off feeling more pornographic than shocking. Storm Shadow's execution of an unseen guard wit ha few flicks of his blade comes off as equally strange and matter-of-fact. When you are watching this movie, thinking kids will be watching this, the lack of horror at these aspects leaves you really cold. There is no thrill from knowing about their future comeuppance,there is no style - it just happens.<br /><br />What I find most telling about this movie is how virtually all of the characters from it are killed off for the sequel to provide a blank slate. There is really nothing to build on here, and it was a dreadful, dreadful movie.

B007NR9WBG|5.0|Just a \\"heads up\\" here: the movie on the Blu-Ray is true to the director's intent and plays mostly as a smaller image in the middle of your big screen TV. Only the special brain recording sequences are displayed in complete left-to-right edge widescreen mode. This emulates the way the movie was presented in theaters. For a complete explanation, please see Andre Dursin's review here on Amazon.

B000MXPE74|3.0|I first got wind of The Fratellis when they opened for The Police on their reunion tour on the Philadelphia stop. The Scottish trio was raucous, energetic and had songs that were loaded with do-do-do's and la-la-la's. Perfect for a big stadium of sing-alongs. Nothing complicated, and as the soundbite that was used in a famous beer commercial showed (\\"Chelsea Dagger\\"), these guys could pound out a great hook to down a pint by.<br /><br />\\"Costello Music\\" is a title without meaning from a band with no big messages. There's no time to bother with any ballads, they wouldn't fit the la-la's on the likes of \\"For The Girl\\" (about a star-crossed pair of lovers whose main flaw was that \\"She was into the stones when I was into the Roses.\\" Sure, it's an inside musical joke, and if you get it, The Fratellis are probably a band you'll like.

0307352145|5.0|When I first became aware of Quiet, I knew it was a book I had to read.  I've always been an introvert, content to curl up with a book for hours and wary of crowded places and loud parties.  Yet, even though I was aware of my introversion, I don't think I really understood it and what it meant.  I always saw it as a sort of flexible personality trait that I could change if I wanted to, and I always had the sense that there was something unhealthy about my particular personality type.  After reading the book, I feel I have a much better understanding not only of myself, but of how the way American society is structured tends to work against someone like me.<br /><br />Cain uses a blend of some of the latest neurological research and years of psychiatric studies to show why introverts and extroverts are so different, and to lay rest to the idea that there's something broken in people who don't meet the gregarious, outgoing American ideal.  The neuroscience she highlights in the book is easily understandable to the layperson, and shows how the brains of introverts and extroverts process stimuli differently.  Quite literally, extroverts' brains function in such a way that they are exhilarated and recharged by plenty of social stimulation while introverts need quiet and downtime in order to recharge.<br /><br />Using this research, Cain then shows why so many aspects of modern American life are doing few favors for introverts and, in fact, may be hindering creativity and innovation overall.  One of the topics she discusses is the seemingly ubiquitous open-plan workspace.  Having spent some years in offices, I could feel myself recoil as soon as she began touching on the topic.  The idea behind these plans is that an open atmosphere will create more interaction between employees, thus stimulating creativity and helping to further develop ideas.  This goes hand-in-hand with the corporate love of brainstorming sessions and leadership retreats, all of which I've had the misfortune of attending.  However, as Cain shows, all of these things actually hinder creativity.  People are at their most creative when they have quiet time alone in which to let their mind roam freely.  This is a topic of particular interest to me, and there are plenty of sources that support this conclusion.  Some companies are beginning to recognize this problem and are starting to design offices that provide spaces where people can retreat for some quiet thought and reflection.  This is a boon not only to the introverts, who really need these spaces, but to the extroverts as well because these more thoughtfully designed spaces offer all personality types the opportunity to seek out stimulation when they need it and to retreat into privacy when they need time for quiet thought.<br /><br />Another point that I found particularly interesting was Cain's examination of current educational philosophies.  I'm a former high/middle school teacher and the parent of an elementary-aged child, so I've had the chance to see this in action--not to mention the styles and philosophies with which I was presented during my teacher training.  There currently is a HUGE emphasis on group work, which I think can be attributed to the corporatization of education.  Despite that I am, myself, an introvert, as a teacher, I bought into the idea that kids need to be constantly interacting, but Cain points out the flaws in this idea.  Both my colleagues and myself were sometimes guilty of the \\"Johnny is a great student but so quiet--if only he'd talk more!\\" syndrome, and this book made me realize how harmful that can actually be.  While there is emphasis in modern education on learning styles--the visual learner versus the auditory learner, for example--there is next to no emphasis on how to appeal to various personality types.  I volunteer in my daughter's school, and every year the kids' desks are arranged in groupings, so that students spend a large amount of their time working with other students.  Still, there is a bright spot in that they are occasionally granted small stretches of time during which they're free to retreat to whatever part of their classroom or the outside pod area they like so they may complete an assignment.  Quiet really made me think about how important these opportunities are, and how they need to become a more integral part of the educational system.<br /><br />Most valuable of all, though, this book really made me think deeply about myself and those I love and to think of ways to better interact with them.  I have a better understand now of how what seemed pliable personality traits are actually inherent in me, and how I can work with them instead of against them so that I can alleviate stress and avoid feeling overwhelmed and burned out.  While the book is primarily about introverts, it also helped me to gain a better understanding about the extroverts in my life and how we can live more harmoniously with one another.  The sections of the book that deal with married couples was particularly interesting in this respect, because they showed how our own biases make us judge the reactions of others.  Since we tend to see the world through a certain lens, we sometimes have trouble understanding that not everyone thinks the way we do, and that we may be taking their reactions and misunderstanding them.  This is truly invaluable because I realize that by taking a more thoughtful approach to interactions with others, I can better understand not only my actions but theirs, which will hopefully lead to a better level of understanding between us.<br /><br />Quiet is a book I would recommend to anyone, regardless of whether you're an introvert or an extrovert.  I think that introverts like myself will feel better about our personalities and will see that the way we operate can be a strength rather than a social liability, as many of us have been conditioned to believe.  And I think that extroverts can learn that introverts aren't necessarily socially backwards or cold, but people who often feel awkward in our own skins because we see and admire the outgoing traits of extroverts but may have trouble emulating them.  This book simply works on so many levels: from the corporate world to the world of education and right on down to a personal level.
B005EGXSWW|4.0|I found this book to be on the whole quite good but the ending was a shocker and unexpected.The only complaint<br />i have with this author is his writing style which is disjointed and hard to follow as he continually shifts<br />between characters with no warning so that the reader is left wondering what happened to the character he or<br />she was reading about.The only other criticsism is the over doing of the alcoholic theme in all his stories.<br />I did however enjoy the book and the series.
B003E74B06|5.0|I was halfway through reading my hard-cover version of Belgarath the Sorcerer when we decided to go camping.  instead of packing a large heavy book I decided to download the story from Amazon to my kindle - brilliant decision!!  the e-version compares well to the printed version.<br /><br />you really need to have read the Belgarion and the Mallorean series for this book to really make sense, as it fills in a lot of the background happenings and history that is only briefly touched on in the series.  like the rest of the books in the series, the characters have a real depth to them, reminding me of people i know, so each time i read the books i almost feel as if i'm visiting friends and family.<br /><br />every winter for the past 16 years i curl up in my chair with a blanket, a cup of tea and these wonderful stories and spend the time laughing and crying, trying to read quickly through the scary bits and lingering over the parts that are sweet, warm and and full of love.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell once again comes at a seemingly standard topic in a totally different way that really challenges modern day perception. The stories he portrays through the novel come from a vast field of topics but are all brought together clearly, and effectively through the topic of this book. Definitely recommend this as well as all of Gladwell's other books.

B007SGM084|1.0|I bought all 3 books. the 1st. one was good, the 2nd one I had to skip over all the redundant intimate parts. The 3rd. one<br />is redundant and ridiculous. The male character turns into a needy idiot. He gets mad when a prenup is mentioned. Really?<br />Vampires and werewolves are more believable.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The movie the Dark Knight Rises is a thrilling conclusion to this iteration of Batman. Carried by a thunderous and swelling score by Hans Zimmer, the movie envelops you in Gotham during the peculiar peace. Batman, once again played by Christian Bale, is in the shadows. Without telling too much the antagonist, Bane, played by a terrific Tom Hardy, starts a war. There are many political undertones as well as economic realities that permeate the storyline. However you don't have time to consider them seriously due to the eye candy and mystery of Gotham. The Dark Knight Rises was truly entertaining and our theater was packed. We were one of 10 theaters showing at midnight. Dark Knight purist will not be disappointed. You will also be reminded that Batman is human, but that is not a weakness. Thankfully it's not in 3-D. I would categorize this as a sci-fi thriller. Spend your money... You won't be disappointed. It's Batman and Catwoman and... Enjoy!
B003UBTX72|5.0|I was really surprised with this book.  I felt it was very well written and Mr. Richard's pulled no punches!  He was brutally honest at times.  It is not a quick read by any means and he does tend to ramble on his guitar playing and honing his style, but you can tell that he is honestly and truly into his work and that he loves it.  It is written in his own words which, in my opinion, makes it even better..you get the English slang as well!  I was very impressed with Mr. Richard's and feel that he is much more intelligent than I thought.  Granted, he WAS NO SAINT, but what rock star is, you never ever know what they are really like, even if they appear to be a saint and I was surprised by none of his past activities in the least...those who were must have been living under a rock or an extremely sheltered life!<br />The only thing I wish he had covered a little more was more about this relationships with the rest of the Rolling Stones...but then again...he was his own person and would hang out with his own crowd, as did the others..so I got the impression that they were all not as close as we all loved to think they were...they all had their good and bad sides and got on each others nerves.<br />I recommend this to any one who loves or just likes the Rolling Stones and to those of you who don't.  I am not that big of a Stones fan and never have been but I now see Mr. Richard's in a new life and just how much he does love what he does and how  skillful he is and how carefully and how seriously he takes his career.  I didn't find that he took himself too seriously or blamed any one for anything...he took the blame for himself when he was wrong and never made excuses for any one but himself!  He's a human being like we all are and it seems that fans some times mistake \\"stardom\\" for being perfect and are stunned and shocked when they find out their idol isn't as perfect as once thought!!  Also you have to remember this is a Biography...of Keith Richard's not one on Mick Jagger, Bill Wyman, Charlie Watts, Brian Jones or any of the others...that's why throughout the entire book he talks about \\"Himself\\"...what else would you do in a biography?!!  Some don't seem to understand this and think Mr, Richard's is self absorbed!!<br />I really loved this book!Jagger, Bill Wyman, Charlie Watts, Brian Jones or any of the others...that's why throughout the entire book he talks about \\"Himself\\"...what else would you do in a biography?!!

B003K1EYM6|5.0|Hi, as promised in the original review below, I'm updating my review. I got the \\"real\\" connection kit now and I'm using a 3rd Generation iPad and it works like a charm.  I tried it with a 16gb card from a Pentax K-7 and and it worked on first try.  I used also Photogene for iPad and Filterstorm and it worked beautifully with both of these apps.  Like anything on mobile device, I suspect it will crash sometimes, but for now, I'm happy!  Update on the Seller as well, She did send the real one after my complaint and I also got my money back! So yeah.... sweet!!!!!  But it was bought from adorama and shipped to me this time. It was an expensive mistake on their part. So, I think they're honest, but, I would no buy electronics from them, they have cool phone cases and such though. My feeling is the seller is in Asia or buys directly from there... it can work fine, but sometimes not.    ______ original review_____    Hello, I'm sure the real camera kit works well and I plan on getting one directly from apple and I will adjust my review. But I ordered this one right here from amazon using the \\"other offers\\" and chose the cheapest new one which sold from \\" lightening 360\\". Well why would I pay more for the \\"same thing\\" eh? Well to my surprise, it arrived from Hong Kong, I received the thing In a box that looked very much like the original. (closely the printing might look cheaper but I would have to compare boxes.) But, what was inside was made of cheap plastic and the SD card slot had \\"angular\\" opening instead of rounded. The result : sd cards don't even fit in there! The slot is... Too small!!  So, it's just a warning. As I said, I'll adjust my review when I get the real stuff, but here you can get a fake one and waste time! Now I'm just hoping to get my money back. :0/
B007SGM084|1.0|I decided to buy the kindle edition as I was going to be on holiday, basically because it seemed to be a popular book.<br /><br /> Despite the fact that this book is soft porn,and  it does get the reader interested in the personalities, which are basically 2 and several sub characters. After a while it becomes really repetitive, the author runs out of adjectives to describe all her mind blowing sexual excitement. I wish I hadn't bothered to buy the whole trilogy. I am the type of reader that never sneaks to the end to find out what finally happens. What happened was that when it came to yet ANOTHER sexual \\"episode\\" I just skipped it, to continue on with the characters, which I did find (for a while) interesting. After a while ( like 1 and a half books that could have SHOULD have been eddited the book is no longer entertaining, it is just plain boring.<br />I would NOT recommend this trilogy to someone who cares for serious reading, or for good authorship. If I see E.L. James name on another book I would definitely NOT buy it,  if however you have a dull sex-life and want to spice it up, this is a novel / (slash) sado-masochist sex-for- dummies guidebook.
0812550706|2.0|I was expecting a classic, but I found a very weak book. A children's must read, surely. The audiobook version is good.
B005J32Y6Q|5.0|Let me make this short and sweet. I'd give it 10 stars if I could! I watch this 3D DVD at least 2 times a week. The dancing is incredible. The music is fantastic. 3D brings it all to life! Flatley isn't the only great dancer in this video. Beautiful female dancers, and unbelievable dancing from the male counterparts! Simply put, I had zero issues with this DVD. The best buy for the money!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a cute little game that strengthens your planning skills. I'm hooked. I could spend hours playing this one.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I don't understand what all the fuss was about. The sex scenes weren't that graphic to me. It was no worse than other books I have read like the Sookie Stachhouse series or the Stephanie Plum series except this one had bondage. The only thing that disturbed me was the punishment which the character Ana also has a hard time with. Despite the punishment, I was drawn in to the story and I have laughed all the way through the book. The emails between Ana and Christian are hilarious and sometimes insightful. I think you will either like this book or you won't. So glad I gave it a chance. Now I can't wait to go on to book 2.
030758836X|4.0|Gillian Flynn offers up a thriller about love, deception, and sociopathic behavior that is often reflective of real life dysfunctional marriages and just as often funny.  Briefly, and without revealing too much, since the pleasure of the novel is revelation upon revelation, twist after twist, Nick and Amy meet in New York, fall in love, marry, and seem happy, until both lose their jobs.  Nick decides to move back to his hometown of North Carthage, MO, ostensibly to help care for his dying mother and Alzheimer father.  Then Amy disappears, apparently abducted by parties unknown.  It isn't long before the police settle the mantle of prime suspect on Nick's shoulders.  And the question is who took Amy and why, or did hubby murder her?  But beware:  nothing is as it seems.<br /><br />Flynn tells the story from Nick and Amy's perspectives, leaving us to wonder, at least in the first part of the book, who we are to believe.  In part two, Flynn reveals what really happened and why.  In part three, she resolves the situation.  Some have faulted Flynn on the ending, but I found it perfectly acceptable, in keeping with the personalities of the characters.  However, morally tidy it is not.<br /><br />Flynn skillfully handles sociopathy, having her sociopathic character expound, as well as showing how others perceive or misperceive the sociopath.  It's claimed that somewhere around four percent of the U.S. population is sociopathic.  Not all, or even a fraction of, sociopaths are psychopaths, and they are nearly impossible, by their very nature, to spot.  One trait, however, can give them away; that is, the compulsion to escalate their behavior, something Flynn expertly illustrates.<br /><br />If psychopathic killers are your thing, see my list of top-notch titles in my Listmania \\"Killer Crime Fiction,\\" by clicking Explorer.

B0074MZSWW|4.0|I bought this album because the first track I heard on the radio \\"Hold On\\" was funky and fun and just...refreshingly different from the rest of mainstream music.  If you want to hear something new, but addictive, I highly recommend this album.  Can't wait to hear what else they come out with!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Fabulous,just fabulous. I like how I can play uninterrupted(meaning no advertisements). The graphics and animations are excellent. I recommend this game to my friends.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|After reading all three books of the trilogy in under two weeks, I must say that this one was my favorite.  The author's writing and story telling improves greatly from book 1 to book 2 and even more when she reached book 3.  The plot lines and characters are better developed and, while there are still many detailed erotic scenes, more of them are simply inferred or mentioned as opposed to described in great detail.<br /><br />James also does a nice job of bringing the ongoing stories to close and ends with a nice epilogue of where the characters end up in the future.  She also gives us a few scenes of the story through Christian's perspective - when he was found as a young boy, his first Christmas, his original interview with Ana for the newspaper, and when he goes to see her at the hardware store.<br /><br />Bottom line: I think this is the best of the trilogy, but you have to read the other two books in order to understand what is going on in this book.  E.L. James is growing as a writer, and her skills are improving quite a bit with each new story.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Perfect game for my little ones even though they have a hard time with some sets. My teenager finished the whole game. I love it myself.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book was considerably better than the first one in terms of the author's writing and story telling capabilities.  The characters have more depth and the plot lines are more developed than in book one.<br /><br />The story picks up two days after the ending of the first book and is full of emotion, drama, and of course, erotica, right to the very end.<br /><br />If you like 50 Shades of Gray well enough to finish it, you must read 50 Shades Darker.

B004I8WD6E|5.0|When I bought this case, I was expecting a minimalist case that didn't add too much bulk, but I wasn't expecting much in the protection department. It's not like I was ever going to drop my extremely expensive iPhone.<br />DENIAL.<br />Of course after having this phone for eight months now, I have most definitely dropped my phone.... a lot. And I just have to say I LOVE THIS CASE!!!! I'll say it again.<br /><br />I LOVE THIS CASE!!!!<br /><br />I've dropped it on cement floors from head height (today in fact, which is what finally made me give it a review), on carpet, on gravel, on grass, everywhere. Not even a scratch on the case or the phone. Not only does it protect my phone amazingly, it also keeps with the sleek lines that made me buy this phone in the first place. It's easy to get on and off. It does not interfere with the plug in, the camera, the ear phones, or any of the buttons.<br /><br />the phrase \\"you get what you pay for\\" does not apply in this case... you get more.

B0055MI8K2|1.0|I bought this last August and went on a 9 months trip to South America. First, these sandals is very comfortable.<br />The problem is in its lack of durability. After two months of reasonable usage - not every day - a wide crack developed at the bottom sole in both sandals. After 3 months the foot bed in front - where the toes are - began peeling of as if the foot bed material was too soft.<br />I used the sandals for regular city and country light walks nothing too heavy or strenuous(I use boots for hiking.<br />I cannot recommend this sandals.

B0084IG7KC|5.0|In a world with Twilight, 50 Shades of Grey and other popular book series that have (or will) inevitably become movies, it's easy to overlook a film like The Hunger Games. I remember suppressing my inner-eye rolls as Hunger Games posters appeared everywhere, with my friends clamoring at the thought and insisting I read it too. I didn't know anything about the book except it took place in the future and was popular among teens and adults alike, so I took my chances and picked up a copy last minute. Now I finally see what all the fuss is about, not only could I not put it down, I ordered the next books immediately. The series is phenomenal, and with a great story and cast of characters, its easy to see how anybody can become emotionally invested. However after I turned the last page, like the rest of my friends, I realized I had become emotional invested too. So patiently we bit our nails waiting for the movie, and thankfully the media hype didn't disappoint. The film was just as phenomenal as the book, veteran director Gary Ross did not only portray the story correctly, he brilliantly cast the movie with stars tailor-made for their roles. Jennifer Lawrence embodies the lead like no other, her strength, her courage and her ability to overcome obstacles is portrayed perfectly on screen, I couldn't image a better actress in the role. Likewise, the story was beautifully written and well told. For those unfamiliar, The Hunger Games is about a futuristic totalitarian society that split North America into twelve districts after an unknown war, since then two tributes from each district are offered up and forced to combat on a sick reality-type show, thats a lot of story to convey onscreen. Thankfully Ross was up for the challenge and alongside author Suzanne Collins, the two managed to bust out a story that was faithful to its series, while still keeping its distance and originality. Its also managed to keep the story loyal without becoming a slave to its love triangle, this isn't vampires and werewolves meets Panem. While there are elements of romance in the story, like Collins intended, the film focuses mainly on the oppression of society and its cruelty to those in it. The film is without a doubt a recommendation, and a well deserved portrayal of its book predecessor. The only problem now is Ross is no longer in control of the series, the baton now passes to director Francis Lawrence for the next one, and whoever else is available for the last. I sincerely hope Lawrence can follow Ross's example and bring another great installment to the series, in a world filled with reboots, prequels and unnecessary sequels, it'd be nice to have a great trilogy from the start.

0345803485|1.0|Here are fifty (or so) reasons why you should not read this book.<br /><br />1) It is not believable. Ana is a 21-year old girl who has never masturbated. She's also in college, but she's never had a computer nor an email address.<br /><br />2) Ana is not a good character. She just isn't. She is not independent or strong and she acts bipolar (I don't have a problem with mental illness, but if you have it you should get help and not tell everyone how wonderful your life is even though you refuse to admit that you're seriously ill). I mean, seriously, in the first two paragraphs she's about to cuss out her roommate for making her go to this interview, the next she's talking about how she would do anything for Kate. That's not a role model. That's a girl who needs to get her $h!t together.<br /><br />3) Christian is an even worse character. He's manipulative and controlling and completely disregards Ana's opinions, even though he's madly in love with her or whatever. You know you've got an awful character when the second time he appears in the book is after he's driven three and a half hours to the hardware store that employs a chick he just met, and what does he buy? A rope, duct tape, and coveralls. Run, Ana, you stupid little girl!<br /><br />4) The relationship is completely unhealthy. In fact, it's even more unhealthy than Twilight (which we'll get to in a moment). As aforementioned, Christian is manipulative and controlling, telling Ana what to wear and getting angry at her when someone calls her (which she has no control over), and strong, confident, independent Ana just goes along with it because she's head-over-heels in love with him. That right there is a great character.<br /><br />Long story short, Christian and Ana are in an abusive relationship. He hits her, and she doesn't like it, but when she tells him that, his response is pretty much, \\"Oh, well you're just going to have to get over that, then, because I don't feel the same way.\\" Oh yeah, you guys, this is your dream man right here. Right here.<br /><br />Did I also mention that he makes her sign a fake contract (yeah, it's fake, it's not legally binding) so she can have sex with him?<br /><br />4) The writing is very, very poor. It wasn't edited, which many other readers have pointed out. This is surprising to me, this book coming from a big-name publisher, but with this book, poor quality is to be expected in all areas: plotlines (of which there seems to be none), character development (well, Ana lost her virginity partway through the book, that's development, right?), strong characters that we can idolize (we've gone over this part), or writing style.<br /><br />Now, writing style. Mrs. James repeats the same glorious phrases over and over again, until I feel like I've already read parts of the book that I haven't actually read. How am I supposed to keep track of where I am if all the stuff in this book is the same? Oh, that's right, I don't, because this is so bad, I barely even read any of it (didn't read the sex scenes, they made me cringe because they were so ridiculous).<br /><br />5) This is fanfiction. Are these original characters? No. Ana is Bella Swan, who bites her lip and does whatever Christian/Edward tells her and doesn't care how controlling he is because he's super duper hot. She's also very clumsy and has two admirers: one is a friend named Jose, the other is the son of the people she works for at the hardware store.<br /><br />This book was originally titled Master of the Universe, and was an AU twilight fic, in real life. They just changed the names before they published it. I don't even think they edited it. Just changed the names.<br /><br />I guess that wasn't really fifty reasons, but I can tell you that I'm fifty shades of disappointed that a piece of fanfiction about an abusive relationship between a creepy billionaire and a weak-minded college student who can't make up her mind about ANYTHING except that she's in love with ChristianGrey and will do whatever he says is a national bestseller.<br /><br />My advice to EL James is to go back to being a real estate agent (though if her speaking is as persuasive as her writing, I doubt this woman is selling many homes) before you rot the minds of anyone young enough to be impressionable that gets their hands on this. Normally I respect the right of people to release any kind of work they want, but this just makes me angry. Millions of women across the country are WISHING THEIR HUSBANDS acted like Christian Grey (*ahem* Edward Cullen), who is abusive and cowardly at best. I really, really hate this book for that reason; in fact, even more than I hate Twilight. At least Twilight was original.

Quite rightly, the publishers point out that, within its more than 3,000 pages, this handy volume, in its usual robust paperback format, is `the most comprehensive collection of insolvency law source materials applicable in England, Wales and Scotland'.<br /><br />Both editors, Glen Davis QC and Marcus Haywood, as well as both consultant editors, hail from South Square, Gray's Inn -- regarded as the leading set of Chambers for insolvency work -- and are acknowledged experts in insolvency law.<br /><br />Incorporating all the changes to the insolvency regimes in England, Wales and Scotland since the 2011 edition, this comprehensive handbook has been completely updated to include all recent amendments and new legislation.<br /><br />The structure is similar to that of previous recent editions in that it is divided into six parts, which we summarise in order as:  Insolvency Act 1986 and transitional provisions for England and Wales in primary and secondary legislation... EU and International Materials... Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986... Bankruptcy (Scotland) Act 1985... primary statutory instruments ... and in Part 6, miscellaneous primary and secondary legislation for England and Wales which is pertinent to insolvency.<br /><br />The wealth of new material included since the last edition makes it virtually imperative to acquire this latest one.  For example, the book contains the recent changes to the Insolvency Act 1986 and Insolvency Rules 1986... and  the new Practice Direction on Insolvency Proceedings (February 2012).<br /><br />Also included is the Insolvency Proceedings (Fees) Order 2004 as amended by the Insolvency Proceedings (Fees) (Amendment) Order 2011... and the Insolvency Regulations 1994 as amended by the Insolvency (Amendment) Regulations 2011.<br /><br />Additionally, other recent legislation includes the relevant provisions of the Health and Social Care Act 2012... the Charities Act 2011... the Postal Services Act 2011 and the Energy Act 2011.

B007N0REX6|5.0|I have to say its very reliving to hear a great rock n roll albums these days. Slashes new album \\"Apoclyptic love\\" doesnt disapoint me at all. I think its pretty original. it may seem a lil bit to raido friendly at times, but its still a hard hitting piece of art. The only other album shlash was in that topped this was \\"appitie for destruction\\" back in the guns n roses days. I wasnt a big fan of the \\"use your illusions\\" albums so in my opion this tops alot of Guns n roses work, which says alot. Ive been a huge fan of slashes work outside of guns n roses though, like \\"slashes snakepit\\" was amazing, and so are his solo efforts. Overall i would give this album a 9.5/10. it stays strong through the whole album, and never gets dull. i would recomend it to anyone

What are the innovations the treaty implements, or attempts to implement? What are its shortcomings?<br /><br />Whatever your own answers might be, not to mention your multitude of questions, you'll find much to think about and discuss in the pages of this book, recently published by Edward Elgar who are a family business in international publishing.<br /><br />Of special interest to specialist EU lawyers, academics, graduate students and theorists within the EU as well as outside it,  the book is a compilation of  learned articles and essays from no less than 25 contributors, all offering special insights, information and analysis from their respective areas of expertise.<br /><br />Mainly legal scholars and academics from the European Union itself, they range from -- to cite just two examples -- Erkki Aalto, who among other things, is a defence counsellor at the Permanent Representation of Finland to the EU and at the Mission of Finland to NATO in Brussels... to Julian Nowag, a researcher in competition law currently at the Law Faculty at Oxford.<br /><br />The editors, Martin Trybus and Luca Rubini, are respectively Director and Deputy Director of the Institute of European Law at the University of Birmingham.<br /><br />Also worthy of note is the preface by Gisela Stuart, who writes on the European Union and the Rule of Law.  As MP for Edgbaston, Birmingham, Stuart, was one of the 13 people who drafted the Constitutional Treaty and offers a few trenchant words on the distinction that needs to be drawn between `Europe' - a geographical and historical entity and the European Union, `a post-World War II construct of currently 27 nation states.'<br /><br />Her remarks include the observation that `democratic checks and balances are missing in the Union' She concludes that `if the European Union wants to survive, it has to anchor itself in the democratic institutions of the nation state, not try to replace them.'<br /><br />To these comments, we would be tempted to add the opinion of the editors that it is `a pity that with the Treaty of Lisbon, the word \\"community\\" has disappeared from EU jargon'.<br /><br />As you will have by now concluded, this book is a mine of considered, diverse, learned and often contrary and controversial insights and opinions from leading experts in European law and policy.  One of the basic themes throughout however, is that because of the Lisbon Treaty's shortcomings, another major treaty will be inevitable in the future.<br /><br />For EU lawyers and researchers into the complexities of the Treaty of Lisbon, this extensively footnoted book offers interesting background perspectives and should be considered a must-have acquisition, especially with its abundance of research materials, including tables of legislation and of cases.<br /><br />There's also a detailed index which facilitates and simplifies use.

B004RZGUBM|4.0|This is a very concise and well-made collection of (almost?) all that Dickens ever published and more. I love the way the illustrations are integrated in the text and can be enlarged by clicking on them. The whole thing is quite easy to navigate through thanks to the elaborate tables of content throughout the whole volume. The only things I miss are lists of characters for every book, and questions about the books. Therefore this volume gets a very well-deserved 4 star rating.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I'm not an audiophile but I am very picky when it comes to how music sounds and am never really satisfied because I know it can always sound better.<br /><br />In the past 7 years I have used Bose (over the ear), Shure SE215 (in ear) and most recently, Sennheiser HD595 (over the ear) and honestly wasn't expecting much with these Sony's.<br /><br />I was really happy with the Bose and they lasted a long time and sounded good but are falling apart after 7 years of use. Next came the Shure SE215's and I am very happy with these and they are great for mobile devices. Next came the Sennheiser because I wanted something good for listening to music while on the computer and I was actually shocked at how poor they sounded compared to the others (no external Amp on any of these) but they are very comfortable.<br /><br />Anyway, when I took these Sony's out of the box and plugged them in, I was amazed at how good they sound compared to the others I own. When I say good I mean, really, really good.<br /><br />You can hear so much more detail in every song, any style of music, but the biggest difference came when I plugged them into my Roland V-Drums and started playing. I had no idea how much I have been missing.<br /><br />I hope anyone who considers buying these reads as many reviews as possible because that's really what made up my mind to buy Sony.

As such, I need to find an easy way to bring back a sharp edge to it in a hurry.  The Smith's Pocket Pal does the job very well and with ease.  I've used this on cheap knives and expensive ones too and have been satisfied with the results every time.<br /><br />I find that anywhere from 8-10 medium-firm strokes followed by 8-10 lighter, full strokes help me get the best edge on my blades.<br /><br />It doesn't take up much space at all and at its price, its a steal.
B000OVPTAG|3.0|The book was great when I began reading it but towards the middle I found it hard and harder to continue reading it. The viewpoints from the women is a change and a welcome change but I found characters to be inconsistently written. This is especially true of Morgaine which I don't have the heart to read anymore about. She was a fascinating character at start but degraded to nothing but a emotional whore, in my view that is. Ingraine was interesting too but the back and forth on her beliefs got me tired. Gwen remains childish with insatiable lust and one track mind. She does not live up to my imagined views of Gwen from other literary works/films.<br /><br />Honestly, reading this book has had me question women more so now then ever..in more negatives views. Are they really this physchot...err, bad? Look, I understand this position more than most here as my people still live somewhat in this world. Girls marry young (13-15), are confined to wife duties, have no voice, sew, etc., but characters in this book seem much worse to me. Vivianne is the only character I can appreciate and have a emotional tie to at this point.<br /><br />At this point, I can't imagine finishing the book anytime soon. It started out so good but went downhill so quick for me, all because of the women characters and their inconsistencies.

0525952616|5.0|With a significantly more narrow scope than his previous two books, Daniel again strikes the right balance of excitement, fast pace and technological sophistication and then rams it into society, geopolitics and current events. The effect it is to draw our attention to yet another place where our technologies and their uses are outpacing our awareness and our social frameworks for evaluating them. His ability to look at the world multi-dimensionally and one degree off is instructive and revealing. He is so effective because he grounds the discussion of what he sees in engaging stories rather than easy-to-ignore lectures.

1451648537|3.0|\\"Some consider UNIX to be the second most important invention to come out of AT&T Bell Labs after the transistor.\\"<br />-- Dennis Ritchie<br /><br />\\"Those who do not understand UNIX are condemned to reinvent it, poorly.\\"<br />-- Henry Spencer<br /><br />With nearly fifteen hundred customers providing feedback on the virtues and shortcomings of Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs, I would ordinarily refrain from comment.  But I believe Isaacson has misrepresented the development of computing over the past forty years in a way that previous reviewers have not commented on, and as someone who had occasion to view these events from several perspectives, I would like to apply some corrective spin.<br /><br />In several places in his book, Isaacson posits a dichotomy between \\"open\\" and \\"closed\\" systems (e.g., pp. 554 and 561-62 in the hardcopy edition).  Isaacson is not using these terms as they are conventionally used today; rather, he is referring to the degree of integration between the software and hardware of a product.  In today's terminology, an \\"open\\" system is a technology whose implementation details are available for review and modification by anyone who cares to do so.  Anyone who has followed the evolution of computing systems over the past few decades will be astonished to hear that Bill Gates and Microsoft are deemed by Isaacson to be emblematic of the \\"open\\" approach, while Steve Jobs and Apple are deemed the founders of \\"the other camp\\" (i.e., the \\"closed\\" approach).  This would be silly if it weren't so misleading.<br /><br />Gore Vidal wrote in 1977 that \\"There is only one party in the United States, the Property Party ... and it has two right wings, Republican and Democrat.\\"  Throughout most of their existence, both Microsoft and Apple have been solidly at the \\"closed\\" end of the spectrum.  The difference has been one of degree and and results:  Microsoft, backed by the IBM giant, shipped products infamous for being buggy, difficult to use, andnotoriously difficult to integrate with other systems.  By contrast, Apple shipped products that were elegantly designed, very easy to use, but often of limited functionality, and often difficult to integrate with non-Apple environments.<br /><br />The elephant in the room, of course, is UNIX, developed at Bell Laboratories in the 1970s by some of the best software engineers of the century, and still thriving in numerous incarnations (including Mac OS X) today.  I read [[ASIN:1451648537 Steve Jobs]] immediately after reading John Gertner's [[ASIN:1594203288 The Idea Factory: Bell Labs and the Great Age of American Innovation]].  Bell Laboratories had fostered an environment of innovation decades before Steve Jobs strove to create a similar environment at Apple.  UNIX had sophisticated desktop publishing by the mid-1970s -- it simply wasn't commercially available.  UNIX networking code developed at the University of California-Berkeley laid the foundation for the implementation of the Internet as we know it today.  Isaacson seems oblivious to all of this in his search for a facile comparison of Microsoft and Apple.<br /><br />Up until the advent of Mac OS X, the metaphor I used the compare the various systems was something like this:<br /><br />Macintosh: a two-seater sports car -- lovely to look at, fun to drive, but you couldn't haul a trailer with it.<br /><br />Windows: a 1930s box truck built in Mexico from stolen and makeshift parts held together with duct tape and bailing wire, with a broken muffler, spewing black smoke, easy to hotwire, no cargo lift, and prone to stalling out frequently for mysterious reasons.<br /><br />UNIX: a system with the power of a freight train, the speed and maneuverability of a fighter jet, and a commensurate learning curve.<br /><br />Gates is disingenuous (and Isaacson is too technically illiterate to contradict him) when he says that Microsoft is for \\"standards\\" and that Apple's products have built-in \\"incompatibility\\" (p. 230).Microsoft is notorious for its incompatible implementations of standards ... for its secret interfaces ... and for its hideously complex and Byzantine implementation that makes security analysis impossible.  Steve Johnson (a major contributor to early UNIX development) once quipped that \\"Using TSO [an interactive IBM environment] is like kicking a dead whale down the beach.\\"  The same could be said of using DOS/Windows.  (My own metaphor is that doing anything with Windows is like trying to build a ship in a bottle using robot arms.)  Microsoft made money and won market share by shipping shoddy products that would never have succeeded on their own merits without having become a \\"standard\\" through IBM's original partnership.  In 2005, security consultant Dan Geer estimated that \\"over half of the productivity gains computers should have brought the domestic economy were lost due to standardization on the Redmond platform\\" (;login, vol. 30, no. 6, December 2005).  Isaacson quotes Gates as deriding the NeXT technology as \\"warmed-over UNIX\\" (p.  302) -- what Gates never understood is that even warmed-over UNIX is orders of magnitude better than any product Microsoft ever shipped.<br /><br />Since my early thirties, I have had the good fortune to work in a number of UNIX environments.  In 1978, I started doing serious academic publishing using the version of UNIX developed at the University of California-Berkeley, running on DEC PDP-11/70s and later a VAX-11/780.  In 1985, I joined AIDA, a Santa Clara start-up company developing software for designing VLSI chips (the software was later acquired by Fujitsu and used to develop the first 64-bit SPARC chip), and worked on Apollo workstations running Domain/OS (Apollo's implementation of UNIX).  In 1988, I joined Sun Microsystems in Mountain View, using SunOS (and later Solaris) on Sun workstations.  I worked for Sun for seventeen years as a technical writer, manager, and tools programmer.<br /><br />I was laid off by Sun in2005, and found myself with a problem:  I owned no personal computer with which to pursue job hunting or personal projects -- over the decades, all of my work had been done on my employers' equipment, either directly or through dial-up connections using simple ASCII terminals.  (The only personal computer I had ever owned was a Kaypro II running CP/M, purchased in 1983 and retired a few years later when it was dropped in transit.) At first I tried using public computers at the local library, but the invariable Windows machines combined with a two-hour usage limit quickly demonstrated that this would be impractical.<br /><br />Moreover, my expectations had changed.  A friend had given me an iPod Shuffle, and I wanted to transfer music to it from my extensive CD collection.  I had become interested in digitizing family photographs and sharing these through email attachments or optical media.  And I had friends around the country with whom I wanted to video conference using Skype.  In short, it wasn't just about text any more, and I wanted to join the twenty-first century.<br /><br />I briefly considered purchasing a Windows box, tempted by the mirage of \\"standards\\" and \\"interoperability\\", but I quickly rejected this -- I loathed Microsoft and its products, and my experiences attempting to integrate peripherals with friends' Windows computers had confirmed the ongoing difficulty of working with these machines.  Moreover, they lacked even a semblance of the UNIX utilities upon which all of my work was based.  No Windows.<br /><br />At the other end of the scale would have been something running Linux.  But despite my experience with UNIX, Linux was relatively unknown to me.  Moreover, while I applauded the open source movement, Linux seemed a chaotic and confusing world, with infinite choices and possibilities, but also infinite complications.  I had little time to spend coming up to speed on Linux and the various hardware possibilities and the complexities of configuring a working system.  I wanted a machine that someone else had integrated and configured.<br /><br />I have a good friend who has worked with Apple computers for most of her career.  She owned an iBook running MAC OS X \\"Tiger\\", and after examining the machine, I decided to buy a Mac.  MAC OS X has a respectable hybrid lineage, the love child of the Mach kernel from Carnegie-Mellon and various offspring of BSD UNIX.  Late in 2007, I purchased an iMac with a 500 GB disk and a 17\\" screen.  It had a built-in camera and a built-in microphone.  I unpacked it (admiring the quality and artistry of the packaging), plugged it in, and installed the operating system from the CDs.  It just worked.<br /><br />Over the months, I discovered that it had more than a camera and microphone.  The built-in optical drive could both read and burn CDs and DVDs.  Bundled with the system were languages like Perl, Python, and PHP.  All of the standard UNIX utilities were provided, which for a programmer is like having a machine shop and a complete set of carpenters' tools at hand.  There is an SQL client named SQLite that feels remarkably like early versions of the Ingres relational database.  On the XCode CD are not just useful utilities such as RCS and make, but a full implementation of the GNU compiler and development suite (which meant that I could download and compile source code for thousands of open source programs if I chose to do so).  There was groff, the GNU implementation of troff, a full-bore typesetting environment which I make extensive use of.  I have yet to discover the full extent of what has been bundled with the system.<br /><br />Not everything I wanted was bundled with the system, and over the succeeding months, I downloaded and installed the \\"R\\" statistical language ... OpenOffice and LibreOffice (open source implementations of the Microsoft Office suite of applications) ... Gimp (an open source image processing application analogous to Adobe Photoshop) ... Audacity (anopen source application for editing sound and music files) ...  the Firefox browser ... and much more.  I downloaded pre-compiled binaries, not wanting to spend time wrestling with compiling and recompiling.  They just worked.<br /><br />Now that's what I call an open product, Mr. Isaacson!<br /><br />Moreover, I really enjoy shopping at Apple Stores.  They are clean, attractive, well-lit, and well-staffed with intelligent, friendly, helpful people who are considerate and respectful of the fact that my time is valuable.  Any staff member can process your purchase, and since I usually know exactly what I want, I'm usually in and out of the store in less than ten minutes.  This is a stark contrast, say, to Fry's Electronics stores in the San Francisco Bay Area: dingy, poorly-lit warehouses staffed by indifferent (and sometimes incompetent) sales people, with long, meandering checkout lines and scowling security staff prominently placed at the exits.<br /><br />In 1991, when I managed the Solaris documentation group at Sun for some months, my team (many of whom greatly admired Apple products) speculated about a \\"dream machine,\\" a workstation with a UNIX engine and the Apple GUI.  In 1996, when Apple's CEO tried to convince Sun to purchase Apple, our hopes were again roused, only to be dashed when Sun rejected the overture.<br /><br />In the past five years, I have purchased four of these \\"dream machines\\" (my original iMac and three MacBook Pros).  They are made by Apple.

B0054R6BFM|5.0|Im thirteen and I never expected to come across this book at the library when I was on the of commiting suicide... I swear to anybody whos reading this and is about to buy the book, please (Especially you ADULTS cus' you're the main ones that don't this in your teen) read this! It shows what goes on in a teens mind during the time period of commiting suicide.<br /><br />First off is a quick summary:<br />Clay Jensen recieves voice recordings of his dead crush who commited suicide two weeks early. Her name was Hannah Baker. The thirteen cassettes are all thirteen reasons why she commited suicide. Clay finds the shocking truth behind the rumors and her torturing life. He goes to all the places that all has stories behind it, Clay soon finds himself getting so caught up on stories he spends the whole day retracing everywhere that gave her reasons- not to mention the horrible people behind it.<br /><br />My thoughts:<br />I wish Hannah could've went to someone who could have gave her stronger help and honestly when Clay cried at the park I cried also.. I actually had to set the book down and cry for about 10 minutes cus it was so sad and mind blowing! I never thought things like that to people (girls) like Hannah Baker, it makes me sick thinking about it! I wanted to go in the book at the part when Clay was listening to the last cassette and go back 2 weeks earlier and tell her its not the way! But what was the point of me doing that when I was planning on doing it myself too..<br /><br />This book is so perfectly well written,and so hard to put down because all of the the horrible lies was nothing,but sunshine and butterflies...Well not sunshine and butterflies =D<br />I still thought there was chance for Hannah. If only Clay knew what she was going to do the night after the party, was to end her life once and for all.<br />After I finished this heart wrenching story I cried like I actually knew Hannah and we were &#34;bff&#34;. I love this book and I know anyone elsewho reads this will too.<br /><br />Maybe you'll learn something...<br /><br />Oh and I thank Jay Asher for actually for putting the number to suicide line in the book. It really helped me.

B0060AY85C|5.0|Frank Money, the Korean War vet in Toni Morrison's provocative novel, Home, says something we can all relate to in this scorching summer that has gripped the good old USA. Money says, \\"You don't know what heat is until you cross the border from Texas to Louisiana in the summer. ..Trees give up. Turtles cool in their shells. Describe that if you can.\\"  This quote adequately describes the psychological and social impediments that complicate the life of one of Morrison's most memorable protagonist.  The novel is a journey into cause and effect and the human condition in a place we call history. Highly recommended to the intellectual reader who insists on fun and wit  along the ride.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|The game is fun, and easy to understand, but it is a bit too simple for me. However it is fun and adictive. A good occupation !
B007FH9GA6|4.0|I first saw this movie in the theaters and LOVED it.  Such a great adaptation.  Mara Rooney is phenomenal and Daniel Craig is also very good.  So I was excited to share the movie with my boyfriend via Amazon Instant Watch....until I discovered that Amazon removed some content.  It isn't a lot of content, but enough to be noticeable.  Specifically, they've removed the sex scene after Lisbeth meets up with a woman at a bar and takes her home.  In the version I saw on the big screen, there is a fairly explicit sex scene between the two women.  This is completely edited out of the Amazon Instant Watch video.  Now, some could think I'm complaining simply because it's a sex scene, but I feel that the scene is important because it shows that Lisbeth is not always a difficult, anti-social woman.  It shows that she does have the capacity to make connections with people far before she makes one with Blomkvist.  I'm very disappointed that Amazon would edit out any content from movies or TV that they stream.  I will definitely reconsider before purchasing instant video from Amazon again.

0312641893|5.0|Cinder, the debut YA novel by Marissa Meyer, hits the pumpkin out of fairy tale land. What I like about this twist on the classic tale of Cinderella is the interweaving of science fiction into the story. From the first sentence to the final word of the novel I was hooked.<br /><br />Cinder, who is the heroine and also a cyborg, is one of the top android mechanics in the land and the money she makes supports her family. The story is similar and not similar in many different ways to the original classic. Marissa Meyer is able to make her version fresh and approachable to not only the older generation of readers, but also to the younger one as well.<br /><br />I'm really looking forward to book two, Scarlet, and the rest of the four book series. The Lunar Chronicles are shaping up to be a fantastic series which should grow in popularity and interest as word spreads about Marissa Meyer and her spectacular writing.<br /><br />By Craig MacLachlan<br /><br />This book was amazing. Cinder was a fantastic retelling and update of \\"Cinderella\\" and delivered not only superb characters, but an amazing world with intricate storytelling and plots. Marissa is able to entwine the reader, snaring them into Cinder's world. From the first sentence to the last I was hooked and can't wait to read the next book in the series, Scarlet! Cinder is one of the best books I have read and Marissa Meyer is a blessing to the world of YA books! :)<br /><br />By Christina Kiehnle

0345803485|1.0|Fifty Shades of Dissapointment!!<br /><br />I enjoy reading Erotica and with BDSM even better...I had heard so much about this book that I had to read it.  Man was this book a BIG disappointment! After the first 2 chapters I was wondering if I should keep on waisting my time but there was so much fuss about it that I thought I should give it a chance, thought maybe the story would develop more. However, it just kept getting worse and worse. Ana, Ana, Ana, is there really still 21 year old women out there who had NEVER had any interest in sex at all? Or, never even been kissed? Very doubtful!! So Ana, had never had any interest in sex, had never been kissed and had never masturbated ..oh and at 21 years old she keeps referring to her vagina as \\"down there\\" REALLY!!! She blushes over every little compliment she gets that I just wanted to smack her in the head the entire book.  And how I ask myself a person who had never been interested in sex, never been kissed and had never masturbated herself was good at oral sex??!! Yeah I don't think so.<br /><br />And, Christian is a self-loathing piece of shit. Ana thinks he has a giant penis but really how would she know?! He stalks her to the point of tracking her cell phone! He is too controlling and possessive. How the author thought this would be romantic is beyond me, it becomes too close to an abusive relationship.. very scary!<br /><br />But, I kept on reading anyways mind you thinking it was me and not the book...I felt like I was reading the same shit over and over and over and oh yeah over! I just thought man this author had no imagination whatsoever..<br />How this book became a bestseller its beyond me, there are way more erotica and BDSM booksout there that are better written and more interesting than this crap of a book..The sex scene are not even worth reading.<br /><br />Please Google other erotica or BDSM authors out there and you wont be disappointed this book was a big waste of money and I want my 2 days of time I spend on reading it back!!ime I spend on reading it back!!

B0045HCJ9E|5.0|This film is a roller coaster ride from the beginning when a public relations agent named Roger O. Thornhill is abducted at a classy restaurant for being confused with a nonexistent spy named George Kaplan. Roy miraculously escapes an attempted murder against him and ever since, he's on the run. To make matters more complicated he also becomes a fugitive when mistakenly believed to be the culprit of a murder at the United Nations. And why not? Everyone in the room where the murder takes place sees him holding the knife and his face is on the papers. He escapes on a train, meets the beautiful Eve Kendell (played by Eve Marie Saint) and makes love with her, gets attacked by an airplane (the scene on the DVD's cover), gets arrested at an auction, and ends up being pursued by spies at Mount Rushmore. This thrilling adventure has lots of action, romance, the beautiful blonde (Eve Marie Saint), and lots of humor. I always remember Thornhill (Grant) telling the thugs who leave him at the library \\"I'll catch on my reading.\\" Thornhill's relationship with his mother (played by Jesse Royce Landis) is quite amusing. There's a scene at the elevator that involves Thornhill, his mother, and the two hired assassins pursuing Thornhill that is quite hilarious and a stroke of genius. And there is one piece of dialogue that i simply can't forget:<br /><br />Thornhill: Tell me, why are you so good to me?<br />Eve: Shall I climb up and tell you why?<br /><br />And the way Eve Marie says this strikes a chord in me. She's \\"a looker\\" and pretty sensuous. I also fell in lover with her. In addition, Hermann's score accompanies the viewer throughout the film, adding tension to each scene. Interestingly enough, the ending scene does remind you of the typical conclusion of a James Bond film (this franchise hadn't started yet) although it is done in a very creative manner.<br /><br />I don't think that Hitchcock meant this film to be taken seriously. My impression is that he was aiming at sheer fun, and I simply followed, or have followed several times already, Cary Grant on the run, and all the twists and turns he goes through (I've seen this at least six times already). I suspended my disbelief in the plausibility of its events and enjoyed it.un, and I simply followed, or have followed several times already, Cary Grant on the run, and all the twists and turns he goes through (I've seen this at least six times already).

0385491026|3.0|\\"Cat's Eye\\" by Margaret Atwood is about Elaine Risley who is an aging artist, and,  similar to \\"A Prayer for Owen Meany,\\" takes place when she is older and describes her childhood and experiences with a small group of girls, mainly focusing on the \\"friend\\" Cordelia.<br /><br />Elaine grew up in a less than conventional way, with a father who studied bugs and would have the family on the road often.  Elaine finally was able to make friends (besides with her older brother, Stephen) when she was eight years old and moved to Toronto.  The group of girls she became friends with, led by Cordelia, began to bully Elaine.  Elaine was a pushover but did eventually gain some guts.  I'll leave it at that since I don't want to give too much away.<br /><br />Another similarity to \\"A Prayer for Owen Meany\\" occurs when Elaine experiences a near-death experience and is rescued by, who she perceives is the Virgin Mary.  In general, \\"Cat's Eye\\" stays farther away from religious topics than \\"A Prayer for Owen Meany.\\"<br /><br />As Elaine grows up, she becomes a stronger individual and we learn about her love life, her children, and her moderately successful career as a painter.<br /><br />This could probably be a mini spoiler alert, so don't finish this paragraph if you want to read the book yourself!  I really did enjoy following Elaine's journey through her life, and with her relationships with her family, boyfriend, husband, and on to being a painter.  However, I don't really understand the ending.  Maybe I'm missing something, but to me, it was a well-written, interesting story about Elaine's trip to Toronto, while in the midst of this Toronto trip, she explains about her childhood.  The book begins with her trip to Toronto and ends with her plane ride home.<br /><br />Usually I would not recommend a book where I didn't like the ending, or where I thought the ending was lackluster.  But I honestly did enjoy the book, just was unsatisfied with the ending.

030758836X|3.0|I probably didn't like this book as much as many did simply because I just didn't like the people.  Both Nick and Amy Donne are about as self absorbed as you can get.  However, the twists and turns in this book are amazing and will definitely keep you guessing as to what is the real truth.  The alternate chapters told by Nick and by Amy add to the suspense and the contradictions.  I won't review the plot, but will share my own personal thoughts on the book.  The language in the book does seems to approach junior high \\"let's see how many times we can say 'f***'\\"  {I've taught junior high so am not offended, just bored with that word}.  The characters are all very cynical, but that's probably necessary; what other kind of people kill others, pretend to kill themselves, or whatever.  As a Missourian, I did think the setting was very well drawn and on target.  Finally, it's a good suspenseful read; nothing more, nothing less.

014241039X|5.0|This was the first of Roald Dahl's books I read to my girls (age 3.75 and 5.5) and they LOVED it.  I was only a tiny bit worried that they might react badly to the very unpleasant meanness of Mr & Mrs Twit but they also thought the practical jokes were pretty funny.  The story moves along quickly and in one sitting (a few chapters in), you can arrive at the part in the story where the birds and monkeys start getting the better of the Twits.  All in all, the story was fun, funny, moved along quickly, and provided plenty of laughs.  As long as your young kids are ready for chapter books, this is a pretty good one for younger kids because of the pacing and the fact that there are illustrations on nearly every page.  Other Roald Dahl books open with language that is unfamiliar (British) or more mature and have fewer pictures.  This is a quick read and fine for younger kids.

B000SEGTI0|3.0|First off, I would like to say that I have not seen Bladerunner and my review will not in anyway be related to that movie.<br />This book started off really slow for me. I had trouble getting into it and relating to the characters or really even understanding and caring what was going on in the plot. However after about 50 pages, the story really picks up and the characters become more real. I was sure from the beginning that I was not going to enjoy this book, but in end I have to say that it was definitely worth the read. I am glad I pushed through the beginning to get to the end because it was well worth it.

0307592731|3.0|I like Cheryl. She does have a knack of painting the scene and letting the reader dive into her thoughts. It's an adventure in itself, just reading about what she is thinking. The prime focus of this book is Cheryl's journey through the Pacific trail. After a series of events, she decides to go on the trail on her own.<br /><br />She had done a lot of preparing (at least enough preparation to her at the time) and finally decides to start the trail. Along the way, she meets fellow hikers, suspicious strangers, and lots of revisiting of her past. Some of themes that appear in the book are marriage, sex, love, drugs, family, and death.<br /><br />As I mentioned, I do think that Cheryl has talent and the ability to let the reader into her mind with the written word. It flows very well and is very readable. There are intense, exciting moments. And then there are moments that are mundane and slow. That is all acceptable and understandable.<br /><br />However, Cheryl constantly talked about her bag and she exhausted the symbolism of her heavy bag. It was nauseating and quite difficult to navigate through, especially when she would go on and on about the heavy bag. It really was an irritating experience.<br /><br />I won't spoil much, but Cheryl does go through a powerful transformation and you are right there next to her. I enjoyed the reminiscing of her life, namely her drug and sex life. It is vivid and enjoyable to read.  If you can bear the constant talk about her heavy bag, then you are in for a treat.

B004LWZW7E|4.0|There are more than 200 reviews of this movie and I'll admit I didn't read every one of them.  But after reading 10-20 of them, a pattern begins to form.<br /><br />Rather than delve into the actors and who IS or ISN'T a good actor, I think overshadows what's the underlying and most important factor here:  The concept of whether this type of societal situation could ever happen?  As you may or may not know, the movie was accused of plagiarizing a short story written by Harlan Ellison.  Long story short (no pun intended), a lawsuit was eventually dropped and everyone moved on their merry way.<br /><br />Movies like \\"In Time\\" and others such as \\"I Robot\\", \\"Children Of Men\\" and \\"District 9\\" all speculate about the future of mankind but they all cling to the same premise: that the future is doomed to even worse a fate than we can imagine even in our so called \\"modern times\\".<br /><br />At best, these movies are subjective and whether one can enjoy them or not depends on whether or not you buy into their premise.  Personally, I see them all as thought provoking and yet........a form of escapism.  They are a fantasy created by the writer for us to decide either to go along with it or not.<br /><br />Does \\"In Time\\" have from a technical, artistic and dramatic point of view, faults and flaws?  Yes of course.  Plenty of people have already spoken to this.<br /><br />But this shouldn't be the important issue about a movie (and others mentioned)like this.<br /><br />Just my opinion..........

1932100660|4.0|I gifted this book to my husband on his birthday along-with another audio CD. As we both started reading the book, we realised 2 things. First one, we are in a right direction regarding our food habits. And the second one, we came to know, is all the nutrients and their percentages in particular food items scientifically. We both are vegetarians. So, we have a plant-based diet since childhood. And we are from India, but now in US. So, these habits are in- built. But, we were not aware of the percentages and all scientifically proven facts. This book made us aware of that, which is going to help in the long-term. But, the thing that surprised me was reagrding drinking milk. I agree to author's view that animal- based diet, dairy products can be harmful. But, anyhow, I could not digest the fact that milk can cause some types of cancers. I come from a and follow a tradition, where it has been followed since ages. A person on plant based diet, drinking a glass full of milk just once a day... is it harmful? We have in our food exactly as given by the author. And, I have seen so many people on the same type of diet for so many years. A person not getting enough of nutrients can have a glass full of milk once a day I guess. Anything that is in limit is not going to harm, that is what my observation about these diets says.<br />He conducted research in some specific parts of the world. And it does not apply to some people of different origin, who may be misguided by some of the facts. So, I think, he has generalised the facts. And so,I gave 4 stars. Other than that the book is wonderful! It is always advisisable to follow all things scientifically and this book does a wonderful job!<br />99% of the time we have our lunch or dinner at home. I cook everything vegetarian starting from Indian, Chinese, Thai. But, now I have started cooking scientifically. Author T. Colin Campbell, has invested a lot of resources in creating this book, by which he is giving us a message that investment in health surely pays, and you can see the difference, believe me ! I am happy I gifted this book to my husband, and I would recommend everyone to read it, your thoughts, your perspective regarding certain things will surely change.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so fun and it makes me use my brain its awesome. Its better on a tablet than kn a phone though.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Super duper awesome fun, better than Wheres My Water  I would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys WMW or any physics based games
B008H48KKI|5.0|To me this movie was flat out hilarious. I laughed more in this movie than I have in a long time. Far exceeded my expectations.
B0086700CM|1.0|I love this game it is the best game to play when you are bored. plus it is free. play now or die
B00843TZJ2|2.0|Who puts out a BluRay and records the audio in stereo these days?!  Man, their 1982 release was even Dolby Digital surround!  Baffling.
0385344228|3.0|I'm a trial lawyer so I like these kinds of books as much or more as anyone. I thought \\"Presumed Innocent\\" by Turow was a great book, and to some extent is the standard for that type of work. Who knows, maybe it was the inspiration for \\"Defending Jacob\\" as there are several parallels to the story.<br /><br />\\"Defending Jacob\\" is a solid novel, but nothing special. I didn't think that the plot twist was that unexpected, and the telling of the trial lacked the poignancy of other books. I didn't feel a real solid connection with any of the characters, and to some extent didn't really care what happened to them in the end.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, it is worth the money and a nice enough way to burn a few hours, but definitely not something I'm going to re-read or think about in the future when judging other works.
B005WLQQ4Q|5.0|A great cd for my daughter who loves the band. Just a great present or good listen for anytime at all.
1591841666|1.0|I read it twice thinking I must have missed something (what a waste of time!!!)  Like others have mentioned it is so repetitive and tells you basically nothing at all. It reminded me of our \\"motivational speaker\\" at my college graduation- left everyone looking at each other asking \\"what was that about?\\".  It kept feeling like he was going somewhere with his writing and then that section or chapter or whatever it was, was done and on to the next section, leaving me feeling like it just dropped off with no ending.  Its also confusing; at times he is arguing that you should quit and that successful people quit but then he says successful people don't quit and how can you become number 1 if you quit. This repeats through the whole book. Also, he puts a huge emphasis on being number 1; in my opinion this is the kind of old school societal thinking that has now resulted in a booming section of self-help books about the negative consequences of our overachieving society and its associated stresses, depression, etc. I really thought this book was going to explain how to prioritize and make the best choices for one's life and when to let go (quit).  Plus at times it sounds like it is written by an adhd teenager. There is nothing you can get from this book.
B008MEM24S|5.0|it's super cute! I love Perry, he's so cute in the game. it's a lot like where's my water. and yes it's from the same makers so have fun with this game
B006M4F67A|5.0|Bright and clear tiles--easy to see. Challenging without being frustrating. I will be playing this one for a long time. Good job!
B008MEM24S|3.0|I like this app a lot. But Where's My Water is way better. It isn't a waste of money it's just another app like Where's Waldo Now.
B007N85ZXY|4.0|By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS<br /><br />When Warner sent me the new Neil Young Americana, I sighed.<br />I love Neil whether he's playing heartfelt folk or rebelious rock and grunge. But when I saw he was doing old, old American classics I thought, oh no. How could he possibly bring \\"Oh Susannah,\\" \\"Clementine\\" and \\"This Land is Your Land\\" into the 20th century.<br />Sorry Neil. I don't know where my faith was. You pulled it off.<br />Neil & Crazy Horse also reported they would be<br />launching their first tour in eight years in support of the album.<br />Although Neil hails from Canada he has always<br />considered America a second home. In fact, he has three homes here, California, Florida and Hawaii. His wife and children are from here, yet Neil, who has lived here since 1960, has never applied for U.S Citizenship and has no plans to do so.<br />I always got a kick out of Lynyrd Skynrd when they wrote \\"Sweet Home Alabama,\\" partially in response to Neil's \\"Southern Man,\\" a song about racism in the American South. It makes references to slavery and the Ku Klux Klan.<br />Neil got a kick out of it too. \\"They play like they mean it, I'm proud to have my name in a song like theirs,\\" he said.<br />What made Neil want to cover these old songs?<br />\\"Every one of these songs [on Americana] has verses that have been ignored. And those are the key verses, those are the things that make these songs live. They're a little heavy for kindergarteners to be singing. The originals are much darker, there's more protest in them,\\" he said.<br />And I think he's got a point. A lot of old songs are just partly remembered, but the intent of the original writer was to share their feelings about life, death and the struggles they faced.<br />\\"Tom Dooley,\\" for instance, is an old North Carolina folk song based on the 1866 murder of a woman named Laura Foster in Wilkes County, North Carolina.<br />These are songs all Americans should know ... the whole thing.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|well the reason why is when I did not know how to do it was boring<br />and then I love it
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. It is very relaxing and easy to play. My granddaughter is four and ablsolutely loves it also.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|I hope this cord is better than the original one.  The one that came with the Kindle simply fell apart.  The insulation on the cord just crumbled and fell off.  Some of the reviews that I read on this replacement indicated that the batch for the original had a lot of problems.  Only time will tell if the new cord is any better but I have never seen a charge cord do that before.  Amazon, however, was great in the manner that they replaced the cord.  No cost and shipped right away.
B000SEGCRS|4.0|I started reading book #4 first great book. So I figured I would get #1. I find it highly annoying when someone is trying to be funny and isn't. Granted the book has good info once you weed through the constant poorly - \\"I fooled you again\\" routine. Scott is a very talented guy and great teacher but I think this first book should be re-edited and all the annoying \\"fooled you again\\" should be removed.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book pulls you in and you can't put it down until you are finished.  Just wish there was more!!!!
B001E45XT4|1.0|I've got an average head yet these headphones crush my head and the pain is unbearable after a few minutes. I've tried to stretch them out many... many...many times and they always go back to their super tight position! The padding isn't enough since when it crushes your head it makes the padding go down to almost nothing and your ears will actually touch the insides of the headphone. Sadly I've tried many times to stretch this product out and I never gave up hope on it until now since I'm just tired of stretching the plastic out. Since it's too late to return the item I guess I'll get stuck with a pair of head crushers.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is amazingly hot! The hero is an easy guy to love and the heroine is a smart, self-respecting young lady.  The characters are relatable.  But the writing isn't great, and the writer clearly isn't American.  None of the un-American things are central to the story, but they really stand out.  A middle-aged man who likes soccer and drinks tea?!  Not in this country.  Still... really, really enjoyed the book.  Just don't expect Hemingway.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|As everyone else in the world, I was addicted to this series and was sorry to see it end. I feel like the story ended in a great way
B004X80QNG|4.0|I have been using this application (task only) since they offer the free app of the day. I love it on my kindle and my old phone, but on my new Samsung s3 , I love it too, the only problem I have is there's no sync button on the main screen menu, even after I checked the option (this is for task).
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I love this app. It is very usefull and helpful. I am so happy I can download all my favorite videos from Youtube! I don't know what Id do without this app!!!
0345803493|1.0|I did not enjoy these books at all and I want my money back. Repetition, repetition,repetition. The plot is very familiar, like that of a certain vampire series.  The word Scowl is used so many times that these books should be named The Scowling.  These books are painful to read and the editor should be ashamed. It is hard to read a \\"national best seller\\" when the typos are so distracting. I do not agree that the these books are erotic. No erotic book I have read calls  the female  genitalia a \\"sex\\" or \\"down there. At most they drop a few \\"F\\" bombs and talk about a butt plug a few times. That isn't very erotic. If you want erotic read Letters to Penthouse!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Finally a book with useful info we can use! I have read 3 of Mike Matthews books and found usefulninfo in all of them.Its nice to have someone be honest and not just blow smoke like some other authors.also the email feedback has been great, thanks Mike!
B0086700CM|5.0|I heard a lot about this game from my friends. I finally found it for free, downloaded it, and tried it out. I loved it. I don't know what's up with the talk of it stalling and being unplayable. I've played it countless times and it still works perfectly. Just download it. It's free and works fine.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great!! Very easy to use and consistently performs at a high level. I enjoy all the different Bible versions available.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love it. It is a great version of the game and has tons of worlds. Best thing is,.....  IT'S FREE!!!!
B000IZA9PI|5.0|This is a great movie. I haven't a clue why people dislike it. Sadly it is the last of the TNG. I decided to fire up the Logitech Revue and video on demand it off the Amazon store. It was worth the $2.99 to see it again.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|love the large keys and last entry memory...super easy to use....great app. i would definitely recommended this app to anyone.
0439023513|4.0|This book was not as good as the first two, but man, what an ending! I had to read it several times to make sure I got it right. I never laughed so hard in my life!! LOVED IT!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I went to the movie first, wasn't sure I liked all the violence. Bought the book and liked that because after seeing the movie I understood more what was going on. I am on book 3 now and have to say I enjoyed book n.2 the best. I had to go on to # 3 to see who she finally ended up with.
0439023491|5.0|I was left with a WOW felling again. This book just leaves you in a place were you can't stop now! Keep reading, they only get better!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I read all three series, The second one was the best, It got into more of the characters and not so much sex.
B0057UA486|5.0|It only dawned on me recently that this auteur's work throughout his life is entirely UNIQUE.......Different from Fellini, and so many other brilliant directors' work (and I confess not to have seen yet his entire oeuvre) EVERY singly movie from this brilliant artist is entirely different from the rest of his work.......This is the opinion of a cinema-dilettante, of course, not a specialist-------I guess that when it comes to \\"technicalities\\" there is much that is a \\"continuity\\" but subject matter, mood, historical context, mores--------the whole reason why we see a movie is turned upside down by this MONSTER of Imagination.......<br />First, the movie, a 3-hour haul, has you hesitating for awhile-------too much historical data, overwhelming you if you are not a history buff, and subtle details that escape a first-time view.......Not to worry, this is a movie to observe and richly discover more and more as you sit down repeatedly with, I am certain.....<br />A narrator is used, a most SOBER, aristocratic-sounding, deeply balanced and moral narrator that remains detached and does not offer anything but exposition----and yet enlightening words as well......Why a narrator?......I cannot figure it out yet, but the film is so complex at times, what with all its entrances and exits that perhaps Kubrick felt that the audiences' imagination would be advanced by the \\"help\\" it provides. And yet this is no \\"run-of-the-mill\\" narrator.....It almost sounds, quietly like the voice of a sage----dare I say the voice of a God....<br />The story?<br />Well, of course, the story.....SPOILERS!!!<br />O'neill plays what is unquestionably a good man from the \\"provinces\\", Irish, ambitious enough to get his life into such a complicated web of deceit, manipulation, greed, envy, \\"megalomania\\", social- climbing, so much of all this incremental \\"evil\\" presented in the most intelligent way so that the question at the end remains whether Lindon is indeed a cold manipulator or still a principled human being.<br />It is funny, because in many ways nothing has changed-------and nothing will, I dare say.<br />So much of his downfall comes to issues that are with us as vividly today as in the late 18th century......<br />SHOPPING (other people's money, that is), egotistical manouvres brought on by social climbing (the plight of the \\"Nouveau-riche\\") and the eternal issue of the tortured relationship between Fathers-in-law and angry, rightfully so children who stand to inherit while they see a passive mother do nothing, and the new father carrying on wildly, decimating a fortune.<br />Not to mention a beautiful new heir that is pitted against the previous one in so many subtle ways.<br />O'Neill is MAGNIFICENT in his role, and in what perhaps is a rather too quiet, inconspicuous part Marisa Berenson shines as well. Why Berenson did not go on to pursue a rich career of roles----the little she did tells you that at least when it came to a soignee woman filled with dignity she was so unforgettable-------is a very mysterious question. Perhaps she did not have to work.<br />Pictorially RICH, edited magnificently, the whole affair proceeds quietly, destroying \\"innocent\\" lives along the way in a most sober, cooly-detached way. This is no Hollywood melodrama, of course.<br />Lives filled with hope for JOY and beauty--------destroyed by the serendipity of chance, place, circumstance, and yes, perhaps to an extent, character.<br />Everyone is a suffering being, no one is really to blame, and yet DOOM comes to envelop us all......As close to our human existence as an artist can get------methodically, quietly, slightly ambiguously,offering us the whole of human nature in all its hopes and sad, pathetic ways that \\"life\\" plays on us...............<br />To be seen multiple times----it shall reward us more as we watch again and again........uman being.<br />It is funny, because in many ways nothing has changed-------and nothing will, I dare say.<br />So much of his downfall comes to issues that are with us as vividly today as in the late 18th century......<br />SHOPPING (other people's money, that is), egotistical manouvres brought on by social climbing (the plight of the \\"Nouveau-riche\\") and the eternal issue of the tortured relationship between Fathers-in-law and angry, rightfully so children who stand to inherit while they see a passive mother do nothing, and the new father carrying on wildly, decimating a fortune.<br />Not to mention a beautiful new heir that is pitted against the previous one in so many subtle ways.<br />O'Neill is MAGNIFICENT in his role, and in what perhaps is a rather too quiet, inconspicuous part Marisa Berenson shines as well.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I downloaded this app before I went to bed and thought.I would it for a bit. Little did I know, an hour later I was STILL up playing it! I kept telling myself
B008MEM24S|5.0|My daughter has been waiting forever for this game to come out on Amazon.  We both love this game!!! Go Disney!)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|it becomes second nature to figure these out but still difficult. I have been playing this game for almost 3 days straight.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|What an outstanding series of books this turned out to be. I will be honest and say that after the first book I wasn't quite sure about them... Yes I enjoyed book one but I just at that point in time could not tell if I was going to get that emotionally involved. Boy have I been shocked by how much I ended up loving every last detail of each book. I tend to read rather quickly and when I get really involved I can't book it down. However this afternoon from around 85% I found myself reading a little then putting my Kindle down, then going back to reading a little more. Not because I wasn't excited about what was happening.  It was because I never wanted it to end.  I will miss Mac, Barrons, Dani, Mac's parents, The MacKeltars, Barron's men, the girls at the Abbey... I will miss them all!  Then at the end what do I find?  \\"The End\\"  (turn page) \\"For Now...\\" I could not have been happier!  Sad my time in their world is finished, yes. The hope of more time in their world at a later time, YESSSSS!<br /><br />Shadowfever starts off exactly where Dreamfever left off.  I was so excited to start reading it that I didn't even complete a review for Dreamfever before starting it.  I had to know how it continued, who was there in front of Mac?  Then when I read it.. I put my Kindle down and was scared to continue. Honestly scared.  I refused to Google anything about the book and forced myself to continue.  Then the next day at work over lunch I found out what I had feared most had not happened [well...] and I again had to put the book down because I felt myself almost crying and I didn't want to look like a complete idiot with my co-workers sitting around me.<br /><br />This book [in fact this entire series] has so many ups and downs, twists and turns, shockers, tender moments, hot moments and so on... I was a complete bundle of emotions while reading and it was a wonderful feeling.<br /><br />I hate giving too much away in reviews and I feel if I say anything more it will give away major plot points so I will leave it at this... I wholeheartedly suggest that you read the Fever series as soon as possible.  If you find yourself not investing in the characters after book one please take my word for it, you will very soon! And then you will think back and wonder what you were so worried about to begin with.<br /><br />Oh yeah.. and I *heart* Jericho Barrons! But I'm sure this is a view held by a many people that read this series.away major plot points so I will leave it at this... I wholeheartedly suggest that you read the Fever series as soon as possible.  If you find yourself not investing in the characters after book one please take my word for it, you will very soon! And then you will think back and wonder what you were so worried about to begin with.<br /><br />Oh yeah.. and I *heart* Jericho Barrons! But I'm sure this is a view held by a many people that read this series.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A great ending to the trilogy, I am kinda sad that I am done. Please tell me there will be more to come?? What a sexy read and I love Ana and Christian still and can just picture Christians sexy eyes..HMMM!!!! They had total love for each other, he worships her but the negative reviews say she was a doormat WHATEVER,,, I think she is a brilliant character. She fell in love with him in the first book, she loves him no matter what and will do things she has never done before to please him. Hello thats how most relationships are, we do things for those we love. What a great job Bravo to the author, hope she writes more about this and other topics.
B005S9EL6C|5.0|all people like to dance right so this is the move you should watch  this is the last revolution dance movie for a while lets give it up
B007IXWKUK|5.0|What a read, I couldn't put it down. In this book we are taken on a journey of love sex and secrets. You really get a sense of your characters in this book and the journey they are on. I loved it. What a great job the author did, I loved the way she kept the story going. What a love story, and a sexy read. I am in love with Christian and Ana as characters.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved the book. Not sure why the book has bad reviews if you would have read the sample you would know it was going to be erotic. Bravo to E.L James for having the courage to write a book like this. Its very sexy and raw and amazing that she could write like this on her first book. I couldn't put it down. It is not just about Sex like some people think. You really get a sense of why the characters are the way they are because of their life and life styles. I loved it...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great read. couldnt put it down.already got.book 2on my kindle fire .great summer read. really enjoyed book 1.would highly recommend it.
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|Better than i expected! Nice movie and great actor! This version in blu ray it much more that i remember
B0045TYDNC|5.0|It has changed my life. As I twisted it into place, I knew I would sleep better every night from now on.<br /><br />I might order a case of them.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|so addicting and always keeps you thinking probably the most fun brain game ever its so great just get the app
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|ease of use is terrific...highly recommend it to any and all. especially love how large ot is. very easy to read.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|seriously. this game is several hours of fun. especially for free. I would only ask that you could buy level specific addons. I don't want 1-15. justthe harder ones<br />.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|for those of us that had to listen to every other middle aged, desperate, sex deprived, co worker go on and on that this book was \\"soooo good.\\" wow. it is just lame! i have morals and expectations...i read halfway thru the story and this is not an example of love. if this were my daughter, i would be so disappointed that this is what she could expect from a \\"man.\\"<br />he's one heck of a tortured soul craving to enslave and morally corrupt his most recent naive and immature woman.<br /><br />did it make me giggle, heck yes. some of these scenarios are so obscene and unrealistic!<br />i am of the younger married generation and at 28 with 2 little girls. i think this book is a poor example of how beautiful a relationship between men and women can be, if treated with respectful, truthful love, not the cantankerous christian grey version!<br /><br />i put this book down and bought the glass castle and half broke horses....overall, FAR better choices!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is awesome and addictive. it's worth getting. when it came out I got it and I fell in love with it. it goes from easy to hard which keeps your mind going!!!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book kept me very interested, although I thought of a number of different endings that might have made it more interesting.  The main concept is 'Unconditional Love' - check it out!
0060873027|5.0|Great book.  Such a shame that Michael is now gone from us.  We Will miss him GREATLY.  His mind will be surely missed.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This cover is small and effective.  The outer shell of this cover is compact but very protective.  The cover that goes over the glass is extreamly thin but does its job well.  I was worried that the thing would break at the bending points but so far I've used my fire every day for 7 months and had the cover the whole time and it looks like new.<br /><br />If you want to protect your fire and have the lightest and most compact way to do it, this is it.
B008JAG2AA|4.0|American Reunion was good (un)clean fun.  It's particularly good to watch in high-definition - a must for the nudity scenes.<br />I recommend that couples watch this movie if they've seen the rest of the American Pie sequels.  It'll make you frisky for ideas on what to do after the movie.<br />It was nice to see most of the original cast and the memory lane pictures that rolled during the credits.  I had forgotten about the Shermanator, and finally, Stiffler gets revenge.  If you haven't seen the first (American Pie) you should get it and the other movies to include with American Reunion for an American Marathon.  A band camp somewhere is doing just that.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was one of the best books I've read! It kept me interested from the beginning. I read it in 2 days which is a record for me. The second one is just as good!!
B005NJ2K6U|3.0|This game is ok I bought it trying to up grade a freebee but it<br />Played a little different . Just didn't enjoy it as much .
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie, you should. If you've seen the movie and didn't like it, I feel sorry for you. This is a great action movie with great humor. I give this movie 5 stars and my kids and I can't wait for the other Marvel movies to come out!
0345803485|5.0|Bought this book for my wife because I kept hearing women couldn't put it down. Neither could she. She would carry it around the house reading it. Buy it for your wife and you won't be disappointed!! Whether she's disappointed is up to you! :)
B006LSZECO|5.0|So many plot twists that you are constantly left waiting for the next shoe to drop. Brilliantly crafted. Characters will stay with you long after the book is done.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Love this type of game. Just wish the width if the carved path had better fine line definition. Still quite large with my stylus.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|I was not a big fan of Nostalgia/Ultra either as another reviewer stated, but I figured I would give channel ORANGE a listen. Anyway I really really enjoyed this album all the songs were put together very well. I loved the melodies and piano sounds on \\"sweet life\\", \\"crack rock\\"'' and \\"Bad Religion\\". Frank's lyrics sometimes do not make sense but when his lyrics hit they paint beautiful pictures and scenery. I enjoyed this album a lot it's one of my favorites of 2012.<br /><br />Favorite tracks:<br />Thinkin bout you<br />Sierra Leone<br />Sweet life<br />Crack Rock<br />Bad Religion<br />Pilot jones<br />Forest gump
0425263908|4.0|If you like Fifty Shades, you will like this book. I read the Fifty Shades trilogy and really wanted something to read afterwards. Bared to You was a great fit! They are similar story lines, but there are enough differences to keep you interested. I would recommend it!
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love this game. all of the people who say that the game isn't working on their kindle fire is crazy! it works great on my kindle fire. I have not been able to set this game down. fun twist on where's my water! I definitely reccomend this game, worth the money.
B0037SQ3C6|5.0|I greatly enjoy listening to Chopin, especially his Nocturnes. I have listened to many good renditions (Pollini, Ashkenazy, Rubenstein, Arrau,Pires,Freire,etc.)<br /><br />Yundi's Nocturnes have great feeling and sensitivity.  They are smooth, flawless and soothing. The recording quality is exceptionally good. Pollini is great but my DG recording has flaws (not of Pollini's making).<br /><br />If I could only listen to one recording of the Nocturnes, I would select this version by Pollini with Yundi as second.

030758836X|3.0|If you haven't read \\"Gone Girl\\" and are somewhat confused by the reviews--which is not unlikely, since there always seem to be some who love a book or movie and some who hate it--perhaps the following will help:<br /><br />You'll probably like \\"Gone Girl\\" if you enjoy:  (1) A story with surprising twists.  (2) Alternating chapters written from two different characters' points of view.  (3) \\"Film noir.\\"<br /><br />You'll probably give thumbs down to \\"Gone Girl\\" if you don't like:  (1) A story that doesn't have a major sympathetic character for you to identify with and root for, because it focuses on totally unlikable people.  (2) A relatively unhappy ending.  (3) Violence that is never brought to justice.<br /><br />For me, Agatha Christie (\\"Endless Night\\") did it better because she included at least one major character I liked and cared about (Ellie Guteman Rogers). And a final page that gave me chills.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Dark Skies is one of the great new shows we've had in the last couple years! Don't miss it! Instant favorite!
B0048L4VRA|5.0|We are using this pool for our 9mos old.. she loves it! I love that it shades her and it's small enough to just put on our back deck and cushy on the bottom so we don't have to put much water in it. Great for her age range and a bit older. Perfect for what we needed ;)
B0087PI5XO|5.0|This ended up being an amazing album.  Their third album which was self-titled ended up going in another directed musically which fans didn't seem to enjoy as much as their debut and sophomore albums.  This album brought them back to their pop-punk roots and ended up being a fan favourite.  I thoroughly enjoyed this album.
B00447G2PM|5.0|First, this is a very informative DVD about life in Deep Sea. The narration is a bit mundane...Johnny Depp speaking very monotone and Kate Winslett giving little relief as co-narrator. Still, worth the enlightening exhibit of the sea.<br /><br />Second, and very importantly, the 3D is amazing! The sea creatures really appear to be right there in my living room, er, I feel like I'm right there in the ocean.<br /><br />Overall, this is about the best ocean life 3D DVD I've seen now. Next, also very good, is [[ASIN:B00447G2O8 IMAX: Under the Sea 3D (Single-Disc Blu-ray 3D/Blu-ray Combo)]] and [[ASIN:B004TRJRA4 IMAX: Ocean Wonderland [Blu-ray 3D]]]. Enjoy!

B005HSG3VK|5.0|I love this cover.  It's thin, but sturdy, protects my kindle Fire without adding bulk or weight, is easy to use, and provides a built-in stand for the Fire while watching movies on the unit.  I've owned it a couple weeks and no complaints so far.
B004EPYZSU|5.0|If you enjoyed the ancient alien series on the history channel, this movie is for you. It is the logical extension of the western chapter of that series. The acting is great with many surprises in the story line. I liked the way that all characters that were in it reflected the way the old west probably ran. Blue ray really helped with the special effects, this is something worth owning, enjoy.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I didn't read other readers review because I didn't want a spoiler.  But this is one of those books you needed to know what you were getting into.  I wanted to stop reading but decided this is a train wreck lets see what happened.  Boy was I shocked, half way through the book I was in awe.  I never saw it coming.  What an excellent author.  This book provoked so much emotions love, hate, anger, frustration.  I love and hated it and at the end hated it again.  I can't believe it ended that way. REALLLY!!!  Please tell me there is a sequel.

B00004Z459|5.0|It's been 12 years since this masterpiece of musical architecture hit the shelves. Such was a time when the kind of music you listened to was either rap, rock, pop, hip-hop, jazz, etc. But in 2000 one band would remind us how it's not about the genre of the music--but rather the quality and emotion of the music itself.<br /><br />To this day does Linkin Park continue to write and release their masterpieces out to the public. But before Living Things, before A Thousand Suns, before Minutes to Midnight, before Meteora, there was Hybrid Theory.<br /><br />To give you a little history, Linkin Park originated in 1996 under the name Xero. The band members of this band were Rob Bourdon--a percussionist; Mike Shinoda--a vocalist, rhythm guitar player, keyboard player, and pianist; Brad Delson--a guitar and keyboard player; Dave \\"Phoenix\\" Farrel--bass player; and Mark Wakefield--the main vocalist. It wasn't until 1998 when Wakefield left the band behind and allowed the current vocalist, Chester Bennington, to join the group and show off his amazing singing talent.<br /><br />After proving himself worthy of the band's attention, Chester Bennington became one of the few people to sing like an \\"angel\\" and scream like a \\"demon.\\" It was shortly after Bennington's arrival when Xero decided to rename themselves Hybrid Theory: a theory to create a successful hybrid of musical genres. Shortly thereafter did the band finally decide to call themselves Linkin Park--after receiving some inspiration from Santa Monica's Lincoln Park.<br /><br />Finally in 1999 did Linkin Park sign a deal with Warner Bros. studios to release their new album: Hybrid Theory. In it are 12 songs: Papercut, One Step Closer, With You, Points of Authority, Crawling, Runaway, By Myself, A Place for My Head, Forgotten, Cure for The Itch, and Pushing Me Away.<br /><br />Each of the songs hold their own kind of musical genre to them. We get to hear an equal balance between rap, hard rock, screamo; the list goes on. But that's what's so special about Hybrid Theory--and Linkin Park's music in general. You can listen to their music and you won't think any of the genres listed above; instead you'll think \\"this is Linkin Park.\\"<br /><br />Throughout the course of Hybrid Theory's songs do we alternate between Shinoda's rapping, Bennington's screams, and Brad's guitar. All the while do we get a deep sense of emotion for the six men performing for us. Such emotions contain anger, sorrow, and rebellion--three emotions I yearn for when I'm writing my books. Maybe it's just me, but these emotions really appeal to me.<br /><br />In a world where music is dominated by autotuning and electronic noises, I think I speak for all the rock and roll fans when I say more people need to make albums like this. Say what you will about Linkin Park, there's no denying Hybrid Theory is just plain awesomeness.t that's what's so special about Hybrid Theory--and Linkin Park's music in general.

B006VFLIYK|5.0|I am an ardent fan of mysteries and just finished reading The Innocent.  When the killings started, I truly thought I had made a mistake by buying this book.  Also, as others have noted, the plot was beyond complicated.  However, I am so glad I hung in there until the end.  I loved the book and am not ashamed to report that I cried when I finished reading it (that has never happened before).  I was pleased that there was a wonderful show of humanity at the end to offset some of the gore and mayhem.  This is my first Baldacci book but it won't be my last, nor will I be sending The Innocents to archives any time soon.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My 6 and 7 year folds love playing.  They really love when Scrat appears. Keep up the great work and keep making more goals and challenges.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I didn't expect myself to like this book, but after several recommendations by friends, I thought I'd try it. I found it to be surprisingly good for a young adult novel, and would recommend it to anyone who is considering buying it.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|The second book of the Song of Ice and Fire series is an excellent \\"sequel\\" or edition to the series. It almost directly starts up from the same events of the first book. The same events are in place the foremost being the Battle between House Stark and House Lannister over the Iron throne, Arya's struggle to escape from the Lannisters after they executed her father, Daenarys's struggle to attain control of The Seven kingdoms, and Jon Snow's struggle on the Night's Watch. This book surprisingly achieves what not many books do. It actually makes you love and hate certain characters, it makes you detest the betrayals of some (or the betrayals they commit) and makes you think pride or happiness when the house you prefer wins a certain victory, it makes you sad when a main character meets his or her untimely demise. George R.R. Martin has certainly achieved an epic series of books here and not surprisingly HBO even made a television series about the book. Personally I think he has achieved what few author's even dream of achieving and i consider A song of ice and fire series to be an excellent selection of books for an enjoyable reading experience.
B006IDG2T6|5.0|As the author of [[ASIN:B007Y7SEWS Philosophy: What It Is and Why We Need It]], I know a thing or two about the metaphysical issue of free-will vs. determinism. So I can tell you with some authority that Sam Harris' Free Will will provide you with a strong introductory argument for determinism.<br /><br />This book is extremely short and highly readable. It does not get bogged down into complicated discussions of neuroscience. Nor does it go step by step through rival philosophers' arguments, laboriously critiquing each premise. Instead, Harris simply presents the determinist viewpoint in detail along with its implications for morality and politics. This can be a great benefit to a busy reader caught up in the vicissitudes of daily life who still wants some information on one of the most important problems of philosophy: the problem of free-will, or at least on one possible answer to this problem.<br /><br />For the record, I do not agree with Sam Harris' conclusion that we do not possess free-will. However, I would still recommend this book to anyone interested in the subject of philosophy.

0143120530|5.0|Josh Foer does his research thoroughly and his book reflects his knowledge and hard work (the appendix and bibliography itself take up a hefty portion). He goes into depth about the history of memory and recorded information and covers the various strategies and techniques that skilled memory aficionados utilize. I would recommend this book, but this is not meant to be an instructional book. This is about Foer's journey and he partakes in it so we don't have to. But it's an entertaining read that shows what one can achieve with his memory given the right motivation and dedication to training.    Read my full review at the link below:  [...]
B0067TGSOK|5.0|Reading this book I can tell that the author has depth and breadth of thought. He pored over 3,000+ case studies and whittled it down into a simple and organized book.<br /><br />It's finally a book that I feel really simplifies the business process. Businesses can always be expanded and created into a complex monstrosity, but it takes a genius to simplify it so that anyone with passion and a bit of knowledge can begin something. By getting the basics done right anyone can create their own career. You might not become a millionaire, but really who cares about the status when you can simply live like one instead - doing the things you really want to do.<br /><br />I give this book a five star because it hits on several points<br />1. How to start a business with skill and knowledge you already have<br />2. How to start a business on a shoestring budget (avg. was $1,000, but can be done for $100)<br />3. Incredibly insightful into many areas of operating a business, especially the marketing part (drawing enough attention about your product). He hits on one of Frank Kern's timeless bit of advice in marketing - offer things for free and follow up with those leads will get you business like crazy.<br /><br />I've always been of the mind that many things you can just begin yourself and test it in the marketplace than having to pay to go to Uni and then doing case studies and not really learning the process of how to actually do business. That's why I say skip college and apply what's in this book. If you spent $30,000 on testing different things you'd have a better education than you'd get from isolated learning at Uni.

B007WFR0QS|4.0|I bought this after listening to \\"Next to me\\", there's a phenomenal live version on youtube. I was drawn in by the lyrics and her voice. Some have compared it to Beyonce's and she does sound just a little like her on a song or two. The songs on this album all seem to have a story. The album grows on you with time. Standout tracks for me are: Next to me, Clown, Daddy, Suitcase, Breaking the Law. The bonus tracks (bought separate from the album) Easier in Bed and Tiger are also enjoyable. Overall, great debut album.
0385523912|5.0|Having known very little about North or South Korea beyond what I'd read recently (about a prison camp escapee and the experiences of two  American journalists imprisoned for trespassing) prior to reading this book, I found these oral histories absolutely fascinating, so much so that I listened to the audio version (read by Karen White, whose kindergarten teacher tone didn't work for me on such serious topics) and then experienced it a second time by reading the book myself.<br /><br />The stories that the defectors shared with Ms. Demick are similar in many ways. These persons grew up with a strong sense of patriotism, solid in their beliefs that what they'd been told about their country and (and by) The Dear Leader was the gospel. Over a period of time, as they suffered through deteriorating living conditions, the famine, and the realization that certain goals were unattainable due to (in most cases) their \\"tainted blood,\\" they were able to come to the conclusion that they'd been lied to and so were willing to risk extreme dangers to themselves and the family members they left behind in order to defect. From the outside looking in, it's difficult to believe that North Koreans were able to accept propaganda as truth in the face of so much evidence to the contrary. For example, one of the subjects of the book is Miran, an elementary school teacher, of whom Demick writes, (p 9), \\"As her students were dying, she was supposed to teach them that they were blessed to be North Korean. Kim Il-sung...was revered as a god, and Kim Jong-il, his son and successor, as the son of a god, a Christ-like figure.\\" Not only is the author's telling of the defectors' stories first rate, she includes valuable information about the history of Korea, Japanese occupation, Korean War, the division of the country into North and South, the living conditions, social structure, the famine, and the brainwashing of North Korean people that led them to revere their leader like a god in spite of the difficulties his decisions forced them to suffer through. In summary, you won't find a better book than this one on the subject of \\"ordinary lives in North Korea.\\" Also good: Escape from Camp 14 by Blaine Harden, The World is Bigger Now by Euna Lee, and Execution by Hunger by Miron Dolot.difficulties his decisions forced them to suffer through. In summary, you won't find a better book than this one on the subject of \\"ordinary lives in North Korea.\\" Also good: Escape from Camp 14 by Blaine Harden, The World is Bigger Now by Euna Lee, and Execution by Hunger by Miron Dolot.

B000JIHP88|1.0|I love Amazon and Amazon service.  I have only great things to say about Amazon!  Not so great about this product though.<br /><br />Our first mobile worked and our baby loved it.  It really helped to transition her to her crib.  About four weeks after we got it, it stopped working.  The mobile would not rotate.  The music still played and the light worked but not the mobile.  The mobile is the most interesting part for little ones.  We exchanged it through Amazon (I got a replacement the next day) and it worked for a while... about 7 weeks and then it stopped rotating the same way the first one did.  It's out of stock on Amazon so we are receiving a refund instead of an exchange.  I am starting to think most of what Fisher Price makes is cheap junk.  They won't confirm what their products are made out of and everything seems to come from China.  I'll be looking for a better quality crib toy for my little sweetie.  I am just happy I got it on Amazon because if I had gotten it at a local toy store or other big box store, I probably would've lost the receipt by now and wouldn't be able to return it.

It's a fanfiction of an AU Twilight universe. Anastasia being Bella and Christan being Edward. It romanticizes abusive, manipulative relationships, which is not okay. The repition of words is just terrible also... It makes me want to bash my friggen head in a wall...<br /><br />Overall it's just a terrible book...I don't recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />EVER...<br /><br />I mean seriously DON'T read it...<br /><br />And I have read some pretty messed up crap...

B004I8WD6E|5.0|I bought this case as a replacement for a case from another manufacturer that had broken and had become dirty (it was a white case). I love the look of the clear case on my white iPhone 4S. It fits snugly but was not terribly difficult to put on or remove. The screen protector was the easiest to apply I've ever used on a  device--bubble free with very little effort--and is super clear. I had been using a different screen protector and had forgotten how gorgeous my iPhone screen is until I took it off, and this protector allows me to appreciate all that gorgeousness. Very happy with this, and the simple packaging and good price point are a bonus. Highly recommend.

1401207529|2.0|I hate how Amazon puts all of the reviews together with each other. This is a review for only the kindle version.<br /><br /> But that being said I still have to write a bad review for the kindle edition. I bought this because I wanted to read a graphic novel on my new nexus 7. I read most of my normal books on a kindle with the keyboard but for a Graphic novel I wanted some color. Well the book works fine except for the print is pages are too small.<br /><br />Naturally I thought to be able to pinch and zoom or double tap for zoom. Well on the KINDLE Instead of the normal zoom function you get this popup window that only make parts of the dialog zoomed in. What's annoying about that is I can't see the the art work, which kind of defeats the whole purpose of reading a graphic novel.<br /><br />I wish that I would have downloaded a sample so that I would've realized that the kindle's app is garbage for reading graphic novels. At least the nook app lets me zoom in on the entire page so that I can read the dialog and see the artwork while reading it. I hate nook but for graphic novels it's far superior to kindle.

This guy is completely amazing and nuts at the same time!<br /><br />I love to run and have read a number of books to help inspire future runs (\\"Confessions of an All Night Runner\\")<br /><br />The sad thing I felt is that this book got in its own way, there was little flow and I found myself pushed to read it. Maybe a ghost writer should have helped out as the tales he has to tell are fantastic however they did not translate onto the page easily.<br /><br />I enjoyed seeing \\"You Tube\\" clips on him more....sorry!
1933492953|5.0|It took about a month for this book to arrive, but it was well worth the wait.  When I flipped through the pages, I was somewhat impressed with the artwork, but not very.  A second flip-through (double-take) proved that the book was mostly made up of inking and not a whole lot of text.  I began to worry if I'd been duped and wasted my money.  What could I possibly learn from a bunch of black and white images with a paragraph or two thrown in?  It reminded me of some the art books my university lists as required reading that cost an arm and really don't deliver.  I could've gotten more artistic education out of a graphic novel.<br /><br />However, I finally found the time to sit and actually read it.  It is an amazing book. Upon attentive study I realized the inkings weren't somewhat impressive they were incredible.  It seems that the author, Mateu--Mestre, has a very minimalist approach to both art and instruction; yet, both his art and his lessons are immensely informative.  The lessons are short and oh-so sweet.  I learned new things just reading the first few pages because Mateu-Mestre isn't just trying to convey an academic sense of storytelling, but the very spirit of it.  And I can tell you that is one of the major issues I have been tackling with my artwork i.e. breathing life into it, creating mood and emotion.<br /><br />Mateu-Mastre's book is a very good complement to two other books I bought, both by James Gurney - who does take a more academic approach to instruction and whose art is detailed and vibrant.  I wish I would've come across these guys when I first began art college.<br /><br />Marcos Mateu-Mestre has created an excellent learning tool here, especially if you are a novice or mid-level artist.  I so highly recommend this book that I would go as far as to say that it is a must have in any artist's library who is interested in narrative art e.g. comics, graphic novels, storyboarding, illustration, concept art, etc...<br /><br />I also recommend James Gurney's Color and Light.
0062060562|2.0|Always looking for the latest and greatest new book, I was excited to see this one come up.<br />I read most reviews that had the majority of positive out weigh the negative.<br />Sorry to say this but the hype was completely unjustified...<br />When I read a book I usually imagine it as a movie, this started off that way but slowly diminished down to a b grade dvd.<br />I too never felt this was a book I could not put down and was glad it was only 358 pages!<br /><br />Read this if you have nothing else to read or go and get a Harlan Coben or Lee Child book.<br /><br />Ps. The end is weak and will leave you unfulfilled.

B007N8RULO|1.0|I have used Spider Solitaire since I first got it with Windows XP four or five years ago.  I was really glad to see it as a Kindle Fire accessory but after three unsuccessful days on the learning curve I have abandoned it.  The cards are moved by finger action and they are very hard to control.  If not aligned perfectly on the intended spot or card, they snap back to their original position.  I frankly don't know if this is a program problem or a Kindle Fire problem since I also have some problem controlling pages in books I read.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Like many other reviewers, I'm a huge Beatles fan -- I've read numerous books about them from all kinds of different perspectives, I've watched just about every documentary ever released, read every interview and article I could get my hands on, and, of course, listened to their entire catalog of songs many times over. I can honestly say, with all the time I've spent celebrating the Beatles, taking into account what they've meant to me from my childhood, how they shaped me as a musician, and how my worldview has been affected by their songs, I had no idea what I was missing with the mono recordings.<br /><br />I am a child of the late 70s, which means I grew up listening to the Beatles secondhand, on scratchy vinyl records, warped cassette tapes, and of course, the legendarily bad late-1980s CD releases. As good as the music is, I don't think I truly heard it as the Beatles intended until I received the Mono Box Set as a gift last Christmas. When the Remasters came out in 2009, like everyone else, I made a choice and went with the Stereo set. That set is excellent, of course, and I recommend that any true Beatles fan should own both the Mono and Stereo sets. But having listened to both, I assert that the Mono Set, with few exceptions, is the best sonic Beatles experience that you'll ever have.<br /><br />The biggest, shining example of that is Sgt. Peppers. The album comes alive in Mono like I've never heard before. I have heard that John Lennon once said that the only way to listen to Sgt. Pepper is in mono, and boy was he right. The track listing is the same as the Stereo counterpart, but the sound and feel of the Mono version is extremely different. \\"She's Leaving Home,\\" for instance, is in a completely different key in Mono because, as the Beatles intended, the tape was sped up, giving it a vibrant feel that the Stereo version lacks. \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,\\" a song I grew tired of once I got older, is now almost new to me in Mono, and reminds me of why the song is so good. In Mono, John's voice and the instruments are given a flange effect which is completely absent from the Stereo version. How the engineers and the guys who mixed the tracks got away with leaving those elements out of the Stereo mix is beyond me. Other tracks, like the title song, and \\"Good Morning, Good Morning\\" have more muscle and feel more rock-and-roll than before. \\"Fixing a Hole\\" sounds especially good now, with the enchanting harpsichord remaining more audible throughout the song, and you can also hear Paul's vocals during the fadeout in a different way, including some soulful scat-singing as the song fades away. None of that is present in stereo, and it is a true shame.<br /><br />The other albums also benefit from the power of Mono -- you get all of the sound coming from the center instead of being split left and right, which puts the music right in your face. Some examples of Mono's rock-and-roll feel can be heard in the tracks \\"The Night Before\\" from Help!, where the intro sounds punchier and starts off a groove that is absent from Stereo, and \\"Ticket to Ride\\" from the same album, with its iconic intro guitar lick, sounds better than ever. \\"Hey Jude,\\" from the especially enjoyable \\"Mono Masters\\" compilation, has more power. I could go on and on, song-by-song, but I think you get the idea. Overall, the Stereo versions, by and large, now seem like a watered-down, weakened version that won't ever make it back into my listening rotation.<br /><br />That's not to say, however, that the Mono mixes don't have *some* weaknesses. I agree with other reviewers on here that the song \\"Help!\\" sounds especially muddy in Mono, and it is one of the few tracks that I prefer in Stereo. And you don't get \\"Abbey Road\\" or \\"Let it Be\\" at all in this collection since no Mono mix was ever made for those albums -- understandable, especially with \\"Abbey Road,\\" since the recording techniques were more sophisticated at that point. The weaknesses are minor, however,and on balance, the Mono set easily trumps its counterpart.<br /><br />A note on the packaging -- the albums are presented as \\"mini-LPs,\\" complete with the original dust sleeves and album artwork, photos, and inserts. Remember the goofy cut-outs from Sgt. Pepper? There here, same as in 1967 when the album was first released. Especially nice is the photo booklet from \\"Magical Mystery Tour,\\" and the mini-poster from \\"The Beatles (White Album).\\" You also get a nice case to store the discs in. It's different than the Stereo set, which is nice.<br /><br />(If you rip the songs to your computer/MP3 player, I recommend using the program Exact Audio Copy, or something similar, to make sure the integrity of each track was intact without compression. If you spend good money to get pristine remastered tracks, don't abuse the recordings by compressing them to MP3s!)<br /><br />If you've been thinking about buying this set but wondering if it's worth it, I can guarantee you it is. Stop hesitating and grab it now.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Excellent book. Highly recommended. Other readers had a problem with the layout of the book but I still found the though I knew that he would live the action in the story kept me engaged and still offered plenty of surprises.

B007ADIRDM|4.0|Luv the design of the furniture and accessories, paid $35, wish it was more like $25 max, but you do get a Clawdeen doll and 4 pieces of spooky style furnishings. Bought this before the MH School Playset came out. Might have just bought that alone, but since I ended up buyung both, (we have one of those Kidkraft 3 story dollhouses,  using 2 stories as the MH dorm filled with beds and one story for the Coffin bean hang out and the MH school right next door) the Coffin bean has been a great addition to my daughter's MH collection. So fun!

0525952616|5.0|What's stayed with me ever since reading an advance review copy was a deep unease at how *present* the book is. Where Suarez's earlier books Daemon and Freedom(tm) were both far-fetched enough in plot that you could safely admire the technical accuracy while discounting the likelihood of seeing something like it play out in real life, I've had no such ability to do so since reading Kill Decision. (And both books were among my favorite tech reads of the last several years.)<br /><br />Great authors give you a good story while leaving you with something to chew on. That's what made Kill Decision such a joy for me: Dan's written about something deeply unsettling: as the tools of war become less expensive and more anonymous, the very nature of warfare has changed (and continues to change). And as technology drives cheaper, smarter, and smaller devices, the potential to deploy those devices as instruments of war - particularly when they're autonomous and anonymous - is intellectually intriguing and simultaneously terrifying.<br /><br />If you've ever enjoyed Michael Crichton's mastery of science, Tom Clancy's military expertise, or Neal Stephenson's thorough understanding of where technology is taking us, you'll love Kill Decision.

B000022TSW|4.0|My movie for last night was \\"South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut.\\" I used to watch South Park episodes on TV. My wife is much younger and she enjoyed them. They were okay, and somewhat amusing and irreverent. I would have preferred to watch other things, but watching South Park was acceptable. So, the other day I saw the South Park movie on the DVD bargain rack at Wal-Mart and I bought it out of curiosity. Wow, 639 reviews. What could I possibly add? Mostly five-star reviews, too.<br /><br />Well, I enjoyed the movie. It was irreverent, as expected, and most of the comedy was centered about language. I was laughing, especially in the early part of the movie. There's just something naturally funny about real young kids or their comic depictions using really course gutter language. I guess it's because it's so unexpected. The kids are so young they couldn't possibly know what they're saying and there it is right out in the open for anyone to hear. My mother would have threatened to wash my mouth out with soap if she ever heard even a small fraction of such utterings. And my childhood gutter vocabulary was nowhere near that of the South Park characters. Plus, there's a lot of breaking wind, throwing up, and eliminating bodily wastes. Why would this Junior-High-level humor be so funny? I guess it's because it's so impolite and the audience feels embarrassed. Laughter is a relief, after all. And I was laughing, right along with everyone else, although I suspect my laughter was nowhere nearly as vigorous as is indicated by others in their reviews. Some of the reviews suggested that the movie was funniest in the first part and then tapered off. That's an interesting observation. This type of verbal onslaught is funniest when you first hear it, but the effect wears off as it continues. That was my experience. After a while it was just no longer very funny and I began wondering when the movie would be over.<br /><br />The story was irrelevant and just a vehicle for the comic language and coarse visual gags. No one would watch the story or find it amusing were the coarse language not there. Also, South Park animated cartoons are primitive, to say the least. They're somewhat clever and amusing, but other animations are far superior. Okay, I was laughing and enjoyed the movie. Would I watch it again? Not likely.<br /><br />Gary Petersonc language and coarse visual gags. No one would watch the story or find it amusing were the coarse language not there.

B000002U9W|3.0|\\"Atom Heart Mother\\" does not rank high in the Pink Floyd canon. It lacks the focus of their later work, including the melodic punch of \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and the rangier but still controlled pulse of \\"Wish You Were Here.\\"<br /><br />Yet it's an important album, because this is the record on which the Floyd began to find its footing after losing one of its founding members, guitarist/vocalist/songwriter Syd Barrett, to the ravages of mental illness that was possibly exacerbated by drug use.<br /><br />After the early glory of the Barrett-led \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,\\" PF had released \\"A Saucerful of Secrets,\\" \\"More\\" and \\"Ummagumma.\\" Each of those albums had its distinct problems -- for more information, see my reviews of each. It wasn't until \\"Atom Heart\\" that the post-Barrett Pink Floyd began to sound sure of its direction. \\"Atom Heart,\\" in fact, provided a blueprint the Floyd would follow on almost every subsequent album; it offered a long piece, a somewhat long piece, and several shorter, more \\"personal\\" compositions.<br /><br />The title track, in the original vinyl configuration, took up the entirety of Side One. It's an ambitious piece of music, with the four members of the band being augmented by an orchestra and choir. In places, it sounds absolutely majestic -- there's definitely a classical feel here, but you can also tell it's a rock band providing the pulse. Unfortunately, it has significant timing problems. Bassist Roger Waters and drummer Nick Mason slow down and speed up, and guitarist David Gilmour and keyboardist Rick Wright basically follow them over the various tempo cliffs.<br /><br />Side Two offers some interesting songs. Waters' \\"If\\" is a lovely ballad, musically speaking, although the lyrics are much harder-edged, with references to insanity that would resurface and intensify by the time he would begin working on the lyrics for \\"Dark Side of the Moon.\\" Rick Wright's \\"Summer '68\\" is definitely of its time; you can practically smell the cannabis and incense, but it's a tuneful, enjoyable piece of pop craftsmanship. David Gilmour's \\"Fat Old Sun\\" begins very gently but builds as Gilmour starts layering in the electric guitar parts. And the album concludes with the group composition \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast,\\" which I loved when I was a teen-ager but find rather annoying now. The voice-overs that would seem so pithy and poignant on \\"Dark Side\\" are, here, just grating -- I really don't need to hear some English chap musing about how much he likes marmalade, or how his back hurts him when he works.<br /><br />This isn't an album I listen to very much anymore, but Floyd fans without much knowledge of the band's distant past might enjoy hearing it. And, again, it's an important transitional work, paving the way for \\"Meddle,\\" on which the Floyd would perfect many of the concepts here.the cannabis and incense, but it's a tuneful, enjoyable piece of pop craftsmanship.

B004ZN9J0K|3.0|\\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\" is vastly overrated by many Pink Floyd fans. The truth is that the band's second album was marred by a paucity of fresh songwriting. This wasn't a surprise to followers of the group at the time; the Floyd had lost co-founder and guitarist/vocalist/songwriter Syd Barrett to an ugly, debilitating collision of mental illness and excessive drug use. He was replaced by David Gilmour, an equally capable vocalist and, actually, a better guitar player -- but Gilmour, at the time, lacked Barrett's imaginative songwriting skills. Bassist Roger Waters and keyboardist Rick Wright were striving to contribute; drummer Nick Mason has never been a strong songwriting force in the band.<br /><br />In short, Barrett had written most of the Floyd's material, and without him, the rest of the band seemed kind of lost. (One Barrett track, \\"Jugband Blues,\\" does appear on \\"Saucerful,\\" but it's not Barrett's best work.) Of the seven tracks on \\"Saucerful,\\" Waters writes three on his own -- \\"Let There Be More Light,\\" \\"Corporal Clegg\\" and \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun,\\" and only the latter track makes a strong impression, with its menacing, rumbling tone. Wright's \\"Remember a Day\\" and \\"See-Saw\\" are pleasant enough, musically speaking, but, ultimately, forgettable. The group-composed title track is a longer, more ambitious piece, but it just doesn't seem to go anywhere. The best Floyd music always has been a kind of aural journey, and this piece simply doesn't know what it wants to be.<br /><br />Still, \\"Saucerful\\" has some nice moments, and was proof the Floyd could soldier on without Barrett. And it wouldn't be long before the glory days of \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here.\\"
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is awesome I love it. it is an addicting game. it is DA BOMB. if u have not tried it u should
B004ZN9NCY|4.0|\\"Ummagumma\\" was, for a long time, a personal favorite of mine; as I've aged, the album has sounded less and less relevant to me.<br /><br />It originally consisted of two vinyl discs. The first featured four live performances from the band -- \\"Astronomy Domine,\\" \\"Careful With That Axe, Eugene,\\" \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\" and \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\" -- and overall it was terrific. The second disc featured four segments in which each band member was to do pretty much whatever he wanted.<br /><br />Of the four, only Roger Waters seems to have developed enough as a writer at the time to pull this off -- his \\"Grantchester Meadows\\" was a languid but compelling aural home movie, which flowed into one of the strangest tracks ever on a Floyd album: \\"Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving With a Pict.\\" Keyboardist Rick Wright's \\"Sysyphus\\" was a 12-minute opus featuring lots of rumbling, low pianos and strange tones; it was frequently quite compelling and listenable, but droned on a bit too long. David Gilmour's \\"The Narrow Way\\" ... well, Gilmour himself later admitted he was just muddling along here (I'd like to quote him directly, but amazon wouldn't allow such language). Nick Mason's \\"The Grand Vizier's Garden Party\\" featured his drumming along with some flute played by his then-wife, Lindy, and lots of odd sound effects.<br /><br />I rarely listen to \\"Ummagumma\\" all the way through these days, but on occasion I will listen to the live half. The version of \\"Astronomy Domine\\" -- which had been written by Floyd co-founder Syd Barrett -- is just amazing here, very energetic and quite spooky.

B000068OCS|4.0|for the most part.  I would have preferred more natural landscapes and fewer urban scenes.  The Phillip Glass score, although repetitive, usually matches the images without being distracting.  I was amazed to learn this footage was captured between 1975 and 1983.  The picture quality is fairly sharp to be that old.

As far as I was concerned it wasn't a problem, just kept reading voraciously until I was done.

0062206281|3.0|I'm glad to see that others enjoyed this novel, but I was disappointed. I loved Shadow of the Wind and found Angel's Game to be an interesting challenge. But the third book lacks the mystery and style of the first two. Yes, we meet characters from the first two novels, but not that much is added - the scenes with David Martin call into question events in Angels' Game, but not in a compelling way (and they are uncomfortably close to the \\"it was all a dream\\" cliche). While Shadow had passages with remarkable imagery, Prisoner seems rushed and flat. Above all, the first two books had an eerie atmosphere that is lacking here. Contrast the visits to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books in the first two novels with the visit in Prisoner, and I think you will see the loss of effective detail and imagery. I hope Zafon will develop a full fourth episode with the imagery and plot depth that made Shadow a classic.

B005LAIHXQ|2.0|first of all, and you will encounter this to the end of time, the script of the film is so vacant, illogical and overreaches so badly, it is nearly all holes, thinly edged with actual storyline.  alien fans, sorry, but although alien allusions are forced into the film, it is no prequel if you want it to be dedicated to a development of thnonsense it fails to develop ANY theme or characters.  that said, i feel the reasons there is such division of opinion about this thing are 4.  1.  critics have praised it all the way up the level of mediocrity, setting aside fanatical and inevitable contrarians such as bob ebert who have salaamed it to heights of quality it has nothing whatever to do with.  2.  in 3d, it really is one of the best visual displays i've seen of a film.  3.  the \\"alienation\\" of what plot there is has attracted masses if 15 year olds who are determined to force meaning upon them no matter how.  4.  unforgivably, scott seems to have imported the dubious damon linderllof expressly to transform what might have been a coherent script into more than two hours of obscurantist tease, only too reminiscent of his constantly and consciously ambiguous Lost.  for those of you who are familiar with blade runner, you will recall ridley's unicorn \\"puzzle\\" dream.  prometheus is made up almost entirely of such unicorns, except you are expected to wait for prom II for them to mean anything.  simple stupidity aside, that is one film too late for me.

B008ALA6DW|4.0|It's as simple as plugging it in and that's it. I'm using this on a MacBook Pro Retina (2012. Packaging is nice (if not overdone) in typical Apple fashion. I've had no issues and the connection speed have been great. Please note you MUST have a thunderbolt port. There are USB adapters that do the same thing for less, but since the MBP (Retina) has only two USB ports, I opted for the thunderbolt adapter (MBP also has two thunderbolt ports, but I have much less need for them).<br /><br />Quality and functionality is great for this product, but I'm knocking off one star because the MBP should have had an ethernet port already on it like previous generations.
B000V6BE6M|4.0|I only purchased one of the Complete Collections - for \\"Return of the King.\\"  It is good, but I think I understand why Howard Shore and Peter Jackson handpicked certain songs to be on the standard-issue soundtrack.  This collection, literally, exhausts me, as it really is a collection of everything from the movie.  And, as invigorating as this music was throughout the movie, there is little to add merit to the preexisting standard CD with its more limited collection.  In other words, you not only have to like, or even love, this music -- you need to be enthralled and obsessed by it to truly allow for it to hold you.<br /><br />I will not be purchasing the remaining two complete collections.  Although I could likely cherry pick 2-3 songs of interest from each, I just do not see the purpose of spending $60-$70 on this collection, as impeccably orchestrated as it is.

I had a few crushed corners of the box which effected one books edge. That shouldn't inpact my reading though, so overall not too bad. Another comment a lot of people said was about the pages and how it skips pages, I took my time to look and scan through all of the books to check and I didn't see any issues with skipping pages.

B007X4ECLY|3.0|After all the negative reviews, I almost avoided this little gem altogether. I rented it, watched it, and enjoyed it so much I purchased it on blu ray and watched it again. For those looking for a light-hearted action flick that pays homage to classic 80's action films like \\"Escape From New York\\" and \\"Die Hard\\" while never taking itself too seriously- \\"Lockout\\" is incredibly entertaining.<br /><br />Plot in a nutshell: covert government agent Snow is falsely accused of murder and sentenced to 30 years in a maximum security prison set in outer space where the prisoners spend their time in a cryogenically frozen sleep. Just before being shipped off to serve his time, the President of the United State's daughter (who conveniently happens to be doing humanitarian work at that same prison) is taken hostage by the inmates. Snow must go in and rescue the President's daughter before time runs out...<br /><br />While there's little to nothing original about \\"Lockout,\\" it is a very enjoyable movie with a terrific comic book atmosphere and tone. Our anti-hero is \\"Snow\\", wonderfully played by Guy Pearce. Snow is a wise-cracking smartass whose one-liners are biting and humorous. When he's not kicking someone's ass, someone is probably kicking his. He always gets into situations that are over his head and he never walks away unscathed. Fight scenes always go back and forth- he dishes it out and he takes it in return- and it's fun watching to see how he manages to get himself out of these bad situations.<br /><br />Obviously, the movie missed its mark with a lot of people and critics in general. If you are looking for a serious, high-brow sci-fi thriller, then I advise staying far away from this movie! If you enjoy brainless action flicks that go great with pizza and a 12-pack (like \\"Blade\\", \\"Death Race\\" and \\"Doomsday\\") then I highly recommend \\"Lockout.\\" If you prefer your action a bit more serious-minded like \\"Taken\\" - probably not so much.<br /><br />Pros:<br />  - The movie isdeeply drenched in a comic book atmosphere and tone that keeps it light and energetic.<br />  - Guy Pearce's snarky performace as Snow is funny, obnoxious and very entertaining.<br />  - The action sequences (particularly shoot outs and fist fights) are well done and bloodier than the<br />  PG-13 theatrical version- although the running time for both un-rated and theatrical are the same (95<br />  minutes) the action is jacked up a notch or two compared to the PG-13 counterpart.<br />  - Some of the CGI for the prision and space ships are nicely done.<br />  - Wonderfully paced- never a slow moment in the movie, highly entertaining from start to finish.<br /><br />Cons:<br />  - The CGI used in the motorcycle chase scene at the beginning of the film are rather horrific. However, I<br />  also feel that it adds to the movie's overall cheesy charm.<br />  - A few acting scenes by minor characters are pretty bad: particularly the scene when the president is told<br />  that his daughter is taken hostage by the most ruthless criminals alive- he may as well have been told<br />  that his ham sandwich had mustard on it instead of mayonaisse.<br /><br />Again, If you are looking for a serious, high-brow sci-fi thriller ala \\"Minority Report\\" or \\"Blade Runner\\", then I advise staying far away from this movie! If you're looking for a brainless but entertaining action flick to wash away a hard day with a 12-pack of your favorite beer- then I highly recommend \\"Lockout.\\"<br /><br />Overall, \\"Lockout\\" is a very entertaining film that will find its place in \\"cult classic\\" paradise.

0810989956|5.0|i loved this book because you get to do stuff in it like creating a van for a road trip or creating a song or use the end half to write things down in.
B008645YEE|4.0|I would normally never even consider buying the score to a movie sequel.  This is mainly because scores to sequels often merely contain what was already given in the first movie -- and that's okay.  It's what you would expect.  After all, superheroes have their theme songs.  But I have to admit, this score seems to have one thing that the \\"Batman Begins\\" score doesn't.<br /><br />When I first saw \\"Batman Begins\\", I immediately fell in love with the music.  There was particularly one unique portion of the music that really stood out for me.  It was played more than once throughout the movie, and I expected to find it all throughout the \\"Batman Begins\\" score.  Unfortunately, it only showed up briefly on one track.<br /><br />I just saw \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" today.  Before we were even allowed to go inside the auditorium, I could hear that portion of music that I fell in love with.  I could hear it playing during the end credits as people walked out of the previous showing of the movie.  This gave me hope that the score to \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" may finally have that one special piece of music that sounds so cool.<br /><br />Well, I was right.  It's on there!<br /><br />Many of you may, or may not, know the part that I'm talking about.  So I'll be specific.  On the \\"Batman Begins\\" score, it starts one minute and twenty-five seconds from the beginning of track 10.  Track 10 is called \\"Molossus\\".  In other words, play track 10 of the \\"Batman Begins\\" score and wait until you are one minute and twenty-five seconds into the song.  That's when you'll hear it.  But it only lasts about 14 seconds, and it only appears once on the entire score!  It showed up way more times in the movie, and it lasted a lot longer.<br /><br />The good news is that we are now given that beautiful tune, on this new \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" score, in a lot more depth.  Its on track 13, which is called \\"Imagine the Fire\\".  On this track, it starts one minute and fifty-five seconds from the beginning of the track.  It lasts about 27 seconds, and it is beautiful!  It's very inspiring!<br /><br />Don't get me wrong.  I like all of the music from the \\"Dark Knight\\" franchise. It has a great theme song for Batman, along with lots of other good tunes.  But that 27-second gem takes the cake.<br /><br />As for the rest of the score, I stand by what I said at the beginning of this review.  The music is good, but it's very similar to what we have in the first two movies.  For this reason, I'm content with my \\"Batman Begins\\" score, and will probably only download track 13 from this new score, \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\".  The 27-second bit from that song is special, in my opinion.

145162445X|3.0|The book is an enjoyable and convincing read.  Unfortunately, after an extensive and 180 page discussion as to how the laws of physics are likely to provide something from nothing and the latest developments in modern physics, L Krauss devotes less than a paragraph to the critical question as to \\"why\\" the laws of physics might exist.  Just like the duality of energy and matter, we have the duality of rules and the results of the rules.  The book is less than satisfying when the author fails to even attempt to postulate \\"why the laws of physics.\\"

B007SGM084|3.0|I classify this as a soap opera interspersed with all kinds of sex - kinky and otherwise. Because it is written by a woman it has given women permission to read this book without reservation. The story is just \\"so so\\" but because of it's mass appeal it will change both women's (and men's, for that matter) sex lives forever. I suspect it will have more influence than the Kinsey studies of the mid 20th century. I doubt her next books will have the same appeal or impact.

B001HN6918|4.0|In my opinion DreamWorks has always played second fiddle to Pixar in the computer generated feature film genre.  Their rivalry has existed for nearly as long as there has been a computer generated feature film genre! Pixar had Toy Story, DreamWorks had Small Soldiers. Pixar had A Bug's Life, DreamWorks Antz. Pixar Monsters Inc., DreamWorks Monsters Vs. Aliens.  Pixar with Cars and DreamWorks with Trucks.  No wait, I made that last one up.  But you get the idea.<br /><br />It seems to me like DreamWorks' best efforts are the ones that don't have a direct Pixar counterpart: The Shrek saga and How to Train Your Dragon to mention a few.  I am of the stance that 2008's Kung-Fu Panda perfectly represents this phenomenon of high-quality DreamWorks originality.<br /><br />What we had there was a bit of tribute to the Kung-Fu classics with a lot of unexpected character charm to cement the intense action sequences and lovely visuals.  When I heard a sequel was in the works, I naturally feared for the worst.  Generally speaking sequels in the CG film arena are hit or miss (with emphasis on miss).  Ever see Space Chimps 2, Hoodwinked 2 or Open Season 2 (or even scarier, Open Season 3)?  Sure you have your Shreks & Toy Stories but more often than not it seems to me that animation studios have a hard time recapturing the magic of the originals; especially when the original contains the ever-illusive element of heart.<br /><br />That said Kung-Fu Panda 2, riding on the success of the first one, was given a budget increase to the tune of 20-mil ($150,000,000 versus 130,000,000), brought back all of the key members of the original cast (with a few new ones) and even retained the vast majority of the production & animator crew.  To summarize, DreamWorks made darn sure not to risk losing said heart of the first film.  Did they succeed? For the most part absolutely.  Viewers looking for something more grandiose may be disappointed but the good news here is that Kung-Fu Panda 2 succeeds at feeling more like a continuation of the first film than it does a genuine sequel.  And considering the first film ended in such a manner where a sequel wasn't necessary, this is a very good thing indeed.<br /><br />Jack Black reprises his role as the titular overweight martial-arts trainee panda and his entire Furious Five retinue return uninterrupted (Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Crane (David Cross)). Series staples Dustin Hoffman as Po's master Shifu and James Hong as Po's noodle-peddling dad return as well. The villain is new this time; a sociopath peacock named Shen, and played to perfection by Gary Oldman.  Other noteworthy additions include casting real-life karate aficionado Jean-Claude Van Damme to play Master Croc.<br /><br />The story takes us back to the visually lush Valley of Peace and finds a newfound camaraderie between Po and his Furious Five cohorts.  At just about the same time Po suddenly realizes that he bears (no pun intended, for now) no physical resemblance to his dad, the villainous Shen surfaces with a weapon of mass destruction and plans to conquer all of China.<br /><br />In terms of scope, the bar has been raised slightly but it's clear that the focus here was to expand upon the character back-stories and their interaction with one another over expanding geographically strictly for the sake of spending some of that additional 20-mil.<br /><br />The plot thickens slightly once Po realizes Shen's ambitions and the fact that he doesn't remember his birth parents aren't completely unrelated occurrences.  Unfortunately though, canceling out the slightly deeper plot structure of the sequel is the fact that Po's clumsy, lighthearted enthusiasm seems somehow misplaced now that he has been revealed a psychologically scarred Kung Fu disciple.<br /><br />Pacing is decent, if a bit longer feeling than the first, though all in all the 90-minute runtime does go by fairly quickly since notime need be wasted setting up backgrounds for our heroes.  Hans Zimmer nails the musical score with his trademarked near-subliminally perfect melodies and heart thumping action accompaniments.<br /><br />In all Kung-Fu Panda joins a pretty slim gathering of titles that actually manage to do the concept of a sequel justice.  While it could be argued that DreamWorks played it safe by failing to stray from the path established in the first one, at least they knew not to fix what wasn't broken.  The old phrase, \\"it's not as original as the original\\" certainly applies as well but here's hoping the formula continues to stay fresh as DreamWorks has stated they hope to milk this into a 6-movie franchise.  Will fans tire of Po's antics through four more films? There's a swamp-dwelling big green ogre who thinks not.time need be wasted setting up backgrounds for our heroes.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|It took me a long time to finally get around to reading this book. All the hype surrounding it really deterred me. I was put off by how popular it was and the type of crowd that seemed to be into it. The same people who loved the Twilight Series really seemed to be into this book.<br /><br />It turns out I was only punishing myself. What I thought was going to be a chore was an amazing delight. I was engaged and interested in the characters. I loved and hated Katniss so much, the conflicting feelings I had about her kept me on edge and made me care about what was going on with her.<br /><br />You knew, yet you didn't know how this story was going to end, I can't really explain it but you think you know, and you are partly right, but you just don't know.<br /><br />I loved this book from beginning to end and I can't wait to read the next one.

Now that you kinda know what's going on in Katniss's world, you can predict a bit better how things will turn out.  Obviously she lives through everything since she's the heroine of the story.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|Most of the big aftermarket coolers are $50+, until I ran into the hyper 212 from Cooler master.  I must say I'm glad I did, spending more than 50 bucks on air cooling is almost a waste and I'd suggest just going straight for a water cooling kit at that point.  The cpu temps with this cheap little beast ( and I must say it's pretty big) dropped 30 degrees from 62 to 30-35 degrees idle temperatures.<br /><br />CPU is overclocked now running in the 40s without sweating it.<br /><br />I'm using a Phenom II x4 955 3.2ghz.<br /><br />If anyone is looking for aftermarket cooling this is definitely your best bet and for the price its unbeatable.  I also added a Scythe kazana cooler for the 2nd cooler, I had to be a little creative to attach the rubber feet provided with the hyper 212, but it worked out well and it sits perfectly on the cooler providing an extra boost of cool air.
B008645YEE|2.0|Lately, many movies have suffered from not so good to weak music. If i would use that statement as an excuse on behalf of Batman, it could be ok. But its not.<br />Soundtrack is below average. It has far to many basses (think it would be aesthetically pleasing? - its not), its more like a noise. There no melody present! Its got pulse and rythm alright...but its irritating and boring, and repeats theme from Batman begins..Honestly, all the \\"new\\" Batman scores suck! What surprises more, is the effort they put to release a complete recording a year after. Anyway, its cold, its got no dramatic overtune, the narrative is muddled bass after bass. No theme for the villain, no theme for the heroes, correction, there is theme : repeated Batman Begins for the hero!<br /><br />To sum, it sucks! What has happened to movie music lately..Its transforming it self to boring , noisy , uninteresting , pop corn like product , ready to be consumed by the masses. To be fair, it serves its purpose : narrate the movie. Nothing more. The sentiment is gone, the awe is gone..<br /><br />I give half star for the \\"imagine the fire\\" track, and half because the tracks have cute name!<br /><br />For Batman fans only!!!

B007SGM084|1.0|I would like to say that I liked this book. I would like to say that the writing was wonderful, the characters three dimensional and the sex steamy. Unfortunately, I really can't.<br /><br />Discussions about BDSM and power play relationships could have helped to mainstream alternative sexualities, but the characters were so cardboard thin that you could never really grasp why the author kept droning about them (you may already by thinking \\"oh my\\" - might as well get used to that phrase, it is used over 80 times in the first book alone).<br /><br />Want to know a little bit about the characters? Ana is the dumbest person alive. Really. She appears to be an undersexed, ignorant college grad who knows nothing about her body, boundaries, safety (forgetting safe words?! Really??), independence or basic brain functioning (when there is a crazed gunwoman on the loose, she can't figure out why the fireworks were stressful for the bodyguard). Christian is a maladjusted survivor of childhood trauma who copes by sadistically beating and controlling women who look like his mother. He has \\"stalker-like tendencies\\" (which are terribly amusing to the characters in the book), a \\"twitchy-palm\\" (because threatening to beat people who do things you don't like is SOOO hot...) and is by turns taciturn and distant or clingy and needy. While I'm not against consensual erotic punishment, her lack of consent and the severity of the interactions made this book (and their relationship) a little rape-y for me.<br /><br />As for the sex, which is why many have found these books so good, it is incredibly repetitive. When one of them isn't murmuring to the other - which happens 140 times in the first book -  he gives her a look, she gets wet, she passively exists while they have sexy-times (except for her gyrating hips) and eventually she explodes. Same formula. Every. Single. Time. While this may not be problematic for you for one book, by the end of three you can't wait for it to be over, which is not exactly the feeling I want to have when I finish a trilogy.<br /><br />For a longer, more articulate review, check out Katrina Lumsden's on goodreads (it is absolutely hilarious). For a better book series, check out Jo Davis's firefighter series.h is not exactly the feeling I want to have when I finish a trilogy.<br /><br />For a longer, more articulate review, check out Katrina Lumsden's on goodreads (it is absolutely hilarious).

B001F12J3Y|1.0|I feel completely hoodwinked by Amazon on this and will likely cease doing business with this company entirely.  I already have this classic film on standard DVD, but purchased this 3D version over numerous LOWER priced 3D options because of trailer footage on another 3D disc purchased.  It is a completely worthless piece of trash, complete with these cheesy red/blue glasses that are supposed to render a 3D effect.  I thought I was getting a genuine passive 3D premastering of the film that would add the additional quality on the trailer I saw.  For the $31 price tag I think this is not unreasonable.  Additionally, Amazon does not segregate the reviews posted to their site well, so you are reading reviews for other products in the view of your considered purchase.  This is the first criticism I have ever had of Amazon to be frank, but I am blisteringly angry at this two bit rip-off of a good customer and intend to show my anger by making NO future purchases until I receive some satisfaction on this matter.

B000XTCBWS|4.0|So many people define this set as definitive and there is obviously some disagreement. Many reviewers have already extolled the many different aspects of this set so I will not repeat them here. Yet, there is a perspective that I did not find expressed.<br /><br />First I will say that I love the performances here (especially Siegfried) and the sound is good for its age. HOWEVER, I think there needs to be a clear delineation between \\"live\\" Rings and \\"studio\\" Rings. I must disclose that I prefer studio recordings most of the time not because of the sound, but because in these older \\"historical\\" recordings people seem to be dying from tuberculosis - there is so much coughing I find it impossibly distracting and frustrating. So having said that...<br /><br />If you are coming to the Ring for the first time I would not recommend this set as your first, or even your ONLY one (especially with the price tag). For the money and the sound I still think that Haitink, Solti, Fisch or even Bohm are MUCH better first choices to get into the Ring.<br /><br />Levine or Barenboim are good choices on DVD, you can even put on the subtitles and have yourself a poor man's libretto. The sound is also very good in both - even if there are some flaws with the performances when compared with the best on record.<br />Say what you will about Solti, but his set is a classic - not withstanding some issues. For example, Solti's Walkure is weak, but the other three in his set are strong.<br />Haitink's set [[ASIN:B00151HZ3S Wagner: Der Ring des Nibelungen [Box Set]]] is very affordable and a digital studio set with great sound and good singing. If you only want one set on CD this Haitink set is my recommendation.<br />Unfortunately Fisch's set is not available all together and can be a bit pricey - however you are guaranteed incredible sound!!! I would highly recommend his [[ASIN:B000GDH99G Wagner: Die Walk&uuml;re [Hybrid SACD]]] and [[ASIN:B000NJM1TQ Siegfried]]...and supplementing with Solti's Rheingold and Gotterdammerung. Some have said that Fisch is the best recorded Ring and I completely agree. I am consistently surprised by how great is sounds. I really love it and would not want to be without it.<br /><br />Now for the price of this present set buyers must understand they are getting a \\"live\\" performance...with all the Bayreuth bronchial issues of the evening - coughing and rustling about. If you are not bothered by cacophonous coughing throughout dramatic scenes then kudos to you. But this is one of the my biggest issues with some historical recordings - particularly the Krauss and some of the Furthwangler Beethoven recordings. And this present set seems to have that in spades. Walter's Act I and Act II of Walkure does not have near the same level of audience noise this set has and for me it does distract from the performance. So I would say buyer beware and know what you are getting yourself into.<br /><br />However, once you have digested the Ring from other sources and have fallen in love with this music as I have...then I would strongly suggest you acquire this set and enjoy it for what it is.eingold and Gotterdammerung.

0785139168|3.0|So this is what happens when you're sick and off work for a week -- you pull out that graphic novel edition of Pride and Prejudice that you've been meaning to read for ages and finally dive in. Pride and Prejudice was the first Austen novel adapted for the Marvel Illustrated line -- comic-book versions of timeless literary classics. As with any adaptation of Austen's work, it is bound to face criticism for plot condension and the losss of pages upon pages of Austen's signature witty, insightful prose. But for a 120-page or so graphic novel, this volume does a creditable job of translating the essence of Lizzy and Darcy's story to the page.<br /><br />Adapted by author Nancy Butler, the text does a surprisingly decent job of remaining faithful to its 19th-century origins. She keeps the action moving at a brisk pace, and while events are often shortened or tweaked to fit the graphic novel format, all of the plot's most famous scenes get their due. From Darcy's famous put-down at the Meryton assembly to his subsequent first (refused) proposal to Lizzy's first view of Pemberly, all key moments are brought to life with relative faithfulness to the original text.<br /><br />I have mixed feelings abut illustrator Hugo Petrus's interpretation of Austen's classic tale. There are to be sure some gorgeously-rendered panels within these pages, and he has a nice eye for period detail. But the color palette is a bit darker than I'd prefer for Austen's brand of frothy social commentary. And many of the characters are blessed with such similar looks that it is difficult to tell them apart, particulary the bee-stung lipped younger Bennet sisters. However I enjoyed his realizations of Darcy, Mr. Bennet, Lady Catherine, and Lizzy in particular, though the latter suffers occasionally from some incredibly awkward facial expressions that detract from the emotin of key moments.<br /><br />A pleasant way in which to while away an afternoon, this edition of Pride and Prejudice mostly hits all the right notes and could serve a a fresh way to introduce Austen to new readers.ll the right notes and could serve a a fresh way to introduce Austen to new readers.

1597801585|4.0|Fantastic read! The vision of the future Paolo Bacigalupi has with regards to the world food sources is believable. The upheavals of politics and the use of gene mutations with food sources that in turns bites us all in the butt are outstanding. This piece of science fiction could very well be a looking glass into the worlds own future. His characters are rich in their hate, fear, and motivations.  I will be looking forward to reading many more of Paolo Bacigalupi's work.
B000FBJAEG|2.0|I thought this book was a bit disjointed.  Too many twists to absorb and it didn't help that the characters were quite boring.  I didn't find myself attached to any of the characters and therefore didn't care what happened to any of them.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|for my first \\"romance\\" book i loved it. i don't know what all the catty talk is about, this book was geared to 20-30 year olds and it did its job. so maybe find something a little more geared towards your age before trash talking. with the amount of books that have sold along with the other 2 she must have done something right.

0375842209|5.0|This was such a unique story, and it completely took my breath away. I love reading, but I'm a picky reader. I never felt like this book was trying too hard either to emulate something else, or to be extremely different. The characters were lovable, even with their flaws. The powerfulness of using Death as the narrator really began to sink in at the end. It's a heartbreaking story that shows the painful realization that no one is safe in war. When a character died, though, it didn't feel like the author was just trying to make a point. Oftentimes the less words that were used, the more a tragedy struck hard. I didn't believe I would shed a tear--especially with Death spoiling parts of the endings, but that almost made it harder to bear. The Book Thief is such a unique and well-written story that really makes you think. Highly recommended for basically anyone.
0393325172|5.0|Several years ago I picked up one of the Jack Aubrey series and found it hard to get into --  a year or so later I realized this was a serial format and read Master and Commander and read several more in sequence --  the only way to approach Patrick O'brian's masterpieces.<br />Jack and Stephen are such vivid, complex characters you can't help but be drawn into their world.<br />The rich nautical details O'brian presents are not too technical -- you soon feel you are a crew member.<br />I haven't finished the series yet but definitely will.

0307719219|2.0|You don't need to read the whole book, just read the following sentence:<br /><br />political centralization + inclusive institutions = prosperity<br /><br />otherwise, even if there is a growth, that is bad.<br /><br />Once you know this and make a decision not to buy the book, it saves around $18 and your precious time wasted on reading the book.<br /><br />This book takes an oversimplistic approach to development and is quite ideologically laden...<br /><br />I'd rather change the title of the book to \\"A Praise for the Modern Western Democracy and Capitalism\\".

B000RZGFZC|5.0|When I first heard this album as a teenager I was disappointed because it was not blistering fast like 'Reing in ...' Now as an adult, I listen to this album often, thinks it's one of their very best efforts. There is so much creativity and intelligence here. Some of their best solo's are found on this album, for instance, the last solo on 'Seasons' is amazing. There is no weak song on this album, even my least favorite song here 'Blood Red' earns praise from me for its unique-in-the-world-of-metal topic on political oppression in communist countries. 'Expendable Youth' is a breathtaking discourse on gang rivalries and their violent consequences. The albums begins and ends with two memorable epics: 'War Ensamble' and 'Season's in the Abyss--two of the best songs they ever wrote and both have aged well. The production is another high point, Andy Wallace makes everything crisp, clear and well balance. A watershed in metal.
1606648233|4.0|Good Wives is the second part of Little Women, by Louisa May Alcott, and was written a year after Little Women. It is set some 3 years after Little Women, and starts with Meg's wedding to John Brooke. It details Jo's successes with writing, at first with less than literary works and later with her novel, Amy's social interactions and ambitions to marry well, and Beth's declining health and eventual death. Laurie, Mr & Mrs March and Mr Laurence all make appearances, and Jo eventually finds true love, but not with her boy Laurie. Trips to Europe and New York, and events in the lives of the March girls all serve as vehicle for the various morals that Alcott wishes to espouse or demonstrate, including how to be a good wife, being true to oneself, turning the other cheek and being charitable. Amy discovers that morals can be decidedly inconvenient. Living in the 21st century and the age of antibiotics makes it difficult to relate to the circumstances of Beth's deterioration and death: Beth decides she is dying (forever weakened after her childhood bout of Scarlet Fever) and no-one seems to even try to do anything about it. Events at the end of the novel segue neatly into the next of the series, Little Men.
031620157X|5.0|This book is amazing! Chris Colfer is a very talented writer!<br />The story is about what happens after what was told on the original stories, not the disney happy ending stories. It's a \\"kids\\" book, but actually everyone in every age would really love to read it, it has valuable lessons all over the book. It's a book who will make you laugh and cry and fall in love with the characters who are all portrayed in a very believable and unique way.<br />It REALLY held my attention and let me thinking about it, I even dreamed about it and I'm gonna read this book over and over. This is already my favorite book of all time and everyone should get the chance to experience this fairy tale.<br /><br />So... can I have the next one please?

B002RHL8DC|5.0|I was surprised at how much I ended up liking this show. It was actually a really funny show with dialogue that felt real and believable. The special effects were awesome. I think the only reason this show didn't do well is that the main character Dr Rush was often cranky and not very likeable.  However I felt his complexities added a lot of depth to the show and made it quite interesting to watch.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|This (regardless of what others may have said) was extremely easy to set-up, as well as great for recording my record collection!  First hint ... read the instructions for the turntable regarding setting it up on your computer!  Make some changes under \\"Sound\\" (Control Panel), and make sure to set the recording levels to 2 as suggested.  The supplied software was not difficult to figure out, utilize the \\"Show me how\\" tutorials people!<br /><br />Currently burning some classic rock from the 60's and 70's to my computer.  Easy to import those files to iTunes, then load on your favorite device!  Now I get to take those classics on the road with me (without purchasing the songs from iTunes or buying any more CD's).  There is minimal hiss,click and pops ... but those remind you of vinyl qualities anyway, so I'm OK with that.<br /><br />Buy a good album cleaner prior to recording to computer, it's invaluable in bringing out the best of your vinyl (as it always has been)!

B0068AWO00|1.0|Why remake an original film unless you intend to improve on 1) story, 2) acting, 3) special effects, 4) soundtrack. This incredible loser fails, fails, and then fails again. It's loud. It's sexy - in in a dark, filthy sort of way... which means it is boring. This remake is one of the saddest commentaries on where the so called 'sophisticated' audience is today. The '85 version was damn entertaining. It had an original story line, INTERESTING characters, cool nuances, and people who could actually act. This POS is right up there with the \\"Dukes of Hazzard\\" and \\"Starsky and Hutch\\" remakes - remember those? Dumb.
0553801473|2.0|I have to admit I did not know about this book series until the HBO series came out, which I enjoyed so much I decided I wanted to read the books.  As a long time Tolkien fan, I've always enjoyed medieval fantasy, and this story seemed richer and more aimed towards an adult audience.  However, as the series progressed, I became more and more frustrated with the lack of character development and plot progression of the very exciting main characters and storyline that the author had created.  As a former English major I do have some understanding of writing, but it's easy to see from the reviews that the average reader can make these same critiques.  I skimmed so much prose in the last two books, because it was just pointless description of places or characters that I just did not care about.  I didn't realize that there were 2 more books planned, and halfway through, I was thinking, \\"when is he going to tighten up the story and get to the point, so he can resolve all of these storylines\\"?  While relieved to see there are 2 more books planned, I fear of what they may be like or how GRRM will resolve the story.  He seems to have lost his plot thread, and gone meandering down some road of conjecture about where to take the story.  Frankly I don't care much about Euron Greyjoy, the Dorne family, or about sellswords in Pentos and Bravos.  Why would an author go so far off track from his main characters and plot?  It would be like reading a whole book in the Harry Potter series that didn't talk about Harry, or focused on Luna Lovegood's aunt's sister.  Honestly.  His editor needs to do some SERIOUS editing, and also light a fire under him to finish the damn story so that he doesn't continue to be distracted.  How anyone could compare this man to Tolkien is beyond me.  Tolkien knew enough to keep his notes on all of his characters and world development out of his stories, not kill off the central protagonists, and resolve the story in a cliff-hanging satisfying manner.  Anyway, I love the HBO series, and just hope they can cull the main plotlines out and present a more satisfying depiction on the show.way, I love the HBO series, and just hope they can cull the main plotlines out and present a more satisfying depiction on the show.

B007IXWL2C|1.0|Okay, I finally made it to the end of this eye rolling piece of drivel.<br /><br />I don't get it. I don't get why this book is as popular as it is. I just don't get it. I really don't. There are so many good books out there -- well-written books with great characters, compelling plots, descriptive settings, poetic lines. Even if I'm not well-versed in the erotica literature, I know, I just know, there has got to be better novels than this series. I feel that the success of this book is a great injustice towards those authors who can write. I don't like to judge books without reading them first; I hate those who do -- it's egregiously unfair. And so, now that I've read through all three, I feel that I have grounds for judgment.<br /><br />Not only is this last book completely unnecessary to the series, but its characters' development, or rather lack of development, absurd plot lines, and fragmented ending changes my opinion of the series as a whole. In this third book, Christian's controlling nature and Ana's idiocy are at their finest. I was more tolerant and forgiving of their character flaws in the first book because characters have to start out at least somewhat flawed in order to grow and develop. I thought the second book was a nice improvement and showed their growth as characters and as a couple. In the third book, they regress completely and perhaps are even worse than the first book.<br /><br />The ending is a complete mess. There is a nonsensical epilogue and then as if that wasn't bad enough, we are also treated to a copycat of Meyer's Midnight Sun -- a retelling of the beginning of the series in Christian's point of view. It is the most disgusting, offensive, and despicable point of view ever. That \\"Midnight Sun\\" chapter completely killed whatever small shred of compassion I was ever willing to offer him.<br /><br />Please, give me that riding crop; I now want to beat the living daylights out of these characters.

B000PC6A3E|5.0|After a series of \\"Batman\\" live action clunkers, Christopher Nolan shows what can be done with one of our best fictional characters.  Unlike nearly all other superheroes, the Batman has no super powers.  So how was Batman born?<br /><br />In this stylish creation, Bruce Wayne is the son of a corporate giant living in Gotham City (New York is a stand in with bits and pieces of Chicago thrown in as well).  While playing keep away with his playmate Rachel, young Bruce falls into a well, disturbing a cave of bats who disburse all around him.  This leads to a fear of the animal that obviously has some bearing on his future.  While accompanying his parents to an opera [\\"Die Fledermaus\\" (The Bat)], he becomes frightened and the family leaves early though a back alley.  Bad idea.<br /><br />The city is under a crime wave.  Bruce's parents are murdered by a mugger.  Flash forward to Bruce's (Christian Bale) college years where he comes home to attend the parole hearing for his parent's killer.  Bruce's plan to kill the thug is preempted as he is killed by another on orders from the mob boss (Tom Wilkinson).  Bruce's guilt that his fear of bats caused his parent's death weighs heavily on him. He leaves his company and his billions of dollars and heads to some unnamed country in the Far East (assumed to be China or North Korea).  He ends up in a hell-hole prison but is rescued by a stranger (Liam Neeson) who offers to give him a new life.  But it will involve training under the guidance of Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe) high in the mountains.<br /><br />The training involves facing fear and death which leads Bruce's confrontation with his chiroptophobia.  Upon completion, Bruce learns that Ra's Al Ghul and his group known as the League of Shadows has been around for centuries destroying civilizations that become corrupt and unruly.  They plan the destruction of Gotham City and want Bruce Wayne to lead the charge.  His refusal leads to the eventual destruction of the training camp.  Bruce escapes, returning to Gotham City to make his own mark on crime as his alter ego, Batman.<br /><br />With the help of his trusted aid and family protector Alfred (Michael Caine) and a previously demoted senior manager, Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), the Batman begins his own war on crime beginning with the mob.  Thrown into the mix is a scheming psychiatrist (Cillian Murphy) who appears to be working for Falcone (Wilkinson) but has another agenda.  He has created an airborne gas that renders anyone who breathes it psychotic and hallucinogenic with their greatest fears amplified.<br /><br />During Wayne's 7 year absence, his old childhood friend Rachel (Katie Holmes) has not only grown into a beautiful woman but a fierce assistant D.A.  She and Bruce still have a twinkling in their eyes for each other and despite some naysayers I found their chemistry to be honest and appealing.  This all leads to a bang up conclusion involving the arrival of the League of Shadows and his personal battle with Ra's Al Ghul.  This Batman is stylistically much different from the earlier films, not to mention the 60's TV series.  It is dark, foreboding, creepy and steeped with action.  What set it apart from others of the genre are the intelligent script, crisp direction and great editing.  Sure the film has some humorous quips but for the most part the \\"A\\" list actors take their roles seriously.  This film was my second favorite of 2005.<br /><br />I suspect this Blu ray disc is akin to the earlier HDDVD package, which I've also seen.  While certainly an upgrade from DVD, it is not of the highest quality we see today.  Compare the movie with the 6 minute opening of the sequel (\\"The Dark Knight\\") included on this disc and you can see the difference.  Still, it ain't bad.  It has a 2.40:1 aspect ratio and has a Dolby TruHD 5.1 audio track.  Again it isn't bad but not up to some of the better Blu rays out there today.  Going for $10 or so is still a bargain..

B005LAII0I|2.0|OK, in terms of direction and photography this movie is no doubt a visual feast and that it on its own deserves 2 stars *I'm sure it took a lot of effort from the producers of this film and I wouldn't want to undermine their efforts*. However, you don't always judge a book by its cover much like you don't judge a movie by it's customs and special effects. The Storyline will always be more important no matter how flamboyant the cast's clothes looked.<br /><br />So, unfortunately this film's writers weren't as expensive as Julia Robert's wardrobe for this film. The idea behind Mirror Mirror is that it's meant to be a parody or a comical retelling of the Classic Snow White tale that I'm sure everyone knows from their childhood, but as the openings suggests it's supposedly from the Queen's POV not Snow White. There are 2 sides to every story right? Didn't Happen! It won't be long before anyone recognizes that the story is in favor of Snow White even though she's not supposed to be the main character. The Evil stepmother is still evil, Snow White is still beautiful and the Prince still falls in love with her. The Only twist is that Snow White doesn't end up eating the apple which makes me question the directors choice? What was the point of that apple scene anyways? To ensure that the Oh so evil Marie Antoinette version of this fairytale the step mother dies? Come On! She could've met her ultimate and tragic fate in a different way or to keep things lighter she could've just vanished once and for all.<br /><br />There isn't much dialogue going on and frankly it's all flat and boring. The Characters are all two dimensional at best except for the Evil step mother but even that didn't save the movie from being lame. The Bollywood ending is also very stupid? To sum it all up, this is movie is for stupid people I don't mean that the people who liked this movie are stupid just that the characters are stupid! I know it's meant to be funny but when was funny equivalent for stupid? And the Macho, Noble Prince wasn't even Macho he was more like a toy actually. They even got the characterization wrong in a bad way.<br /><br />I know, this is meant to be a kid's movie and I shouldn't take it seriously but even for a PG film this was lame. I can think of Way better films out of the top of my head. With the Economy drifting and expenses rising wouldn't you want to watch something worthwhile? Something entertaining and unique at the same time? To compensate for your money?<br />Instead of a unoriginal, unfunny retelling of a classic fairy tale that you'll forget about after 2 minutes from the rolling credits?<br /><br />I think this film would've been more interesting if they made Snow White the evil one and the Step Mother the good one just to shake things up. I mean it is meant to be from her perspective anyways and a wittier dialogue would've been awesome too.d? And the Macho, Noble Prince wasn't even Macho he was more like a toy actually.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|In one of the great sequels, Christopher Nolan returns at the helm of middle segment of his trilogy.  This time joined by his brother, Jonathan Nolan as co-writer of the screenplay, Batman (Christian Bale) gets even darker.  The key players return, except that Maggie Gyllenhaal takes over for Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes.<br /><br />This time out we get a picture of Batman's most ardent villain, The Joker.  This Joker is played by Heath Ledger in his Oscar winning performance.  After watching this version earlier I went back to watch the first (and best) of the earlier live action \\"Batman\\" (1990) films to catch Jack Nicholson's Joker.  At the time, I thought both the film and Nicholson were very good.  Now Jack's Joker seems quaint.  Ledger brings the black humor, but does it in a very sinister fashion.  Pay attention to the earlier scenes when Ledger as the Joker confronts the mobsters in their roost.  This guy is scary good and sets the tone for the later more amplified scenes.<br /><br />As Batman and now Lt. Gordon (Gary Oldman) and a new ally, District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) face off against The Joker, they confront a different kind of villain.  He's not concerned so much about power or money.  He doesn't want anything other than chaos.  The film's plot involves the good guys not only having to deal with the maniacal Joker but with the fleecing of the financial wealth stolen from Gotham.  In a great sequence, The Bat chases Lau (Chin Han), a Chinese kingpin who had returned to his presumed safety in Hong Kong.  Without giving away too much, the kidnapping is beautifully staged, if improbable, and has an appropriately cutesy conclusion.<br /><br />If there is a fault with \\"The Dark Knight,\\" one could argue that the long chase sequence involving the kidnapping of Dent falls into the \\"been there done that\\" category and takes away from the tone of the film.  The ending places Batman into an even darker corner which sets up the final act of the trilogy.  Make no mistake this is a well made film on every level, but Heath Ledger's performance is what makes it exceptional.  This was my favorite film of 2008.<br /><br />This Blu ray disc is a complicated transfer but not problematic for most viewers.  The original film had certain scenes shot in an IMAX format which is larger and has a different aspect ratio than the majority of the film.  You may notice this transition but to me it all blends perfectly.  The picture is a bit of an upgrade over the original \\"Batman Begins\\" as is the audio.  This film has a Dolby TruHD 5.1 soundtrack but be sure to go to the menu to select it (or do it via your Blu ray player) as it defaults to lossy Dolby Digital when play begins..

B000NA28I4|2.0|\\"Eragon\\" is the film based off of the book of the same name written by Christopher Paolini. If you've read the book, then it's hard to believe that you are following the same story. It seems like they quickly scanned the book, took the major characters, and then re-wrote the entire thing. No film adaption of a fantasy novel has ever been perfect, or even contained every detail that was present in the book, but it felt as if they disregarded the book entirely when they wrote the script.<br /><br />They added dialogue that wasn't present in the books, as well as added scenes that weren't in the story, and went as far as changing an entire scene altogether. The best example would be the final fight scene with Eragon and Durza. Nothing about that scene is even remotely close to how the battle was portrayed in the book. When the film originally came out I didn't notice any of this because 1) I was young and 2) I kind of rushed through the book. However, I recently re-watched the film and it gave me the desire to re-read the entire series. Well I just finished book 1 and it left me speechless as to how different the story was in comparison.<br /><br />As I said they did change major things, but it wasn't just that. They changed minor things as well. How Saphira's name was chosen, how Brom died, their time in the Varden, the list goes on. They left out the relationship that was built with Brom and Eragon, as well as the relationship that was built with Murtagh, they ddin't mention Jeod or Solembum, Angela was only present in one scene and I wasn't happy with how they portrayed her at all, but I don't want to bore you with a big list.<br /><br />As a standalone film it is easy to find things that you can like about it. As a film based off of a novel? Not so much. If you want to give the film a try and haven't read the books, then I encourage you to do so, but rent it first. If you have read the book then I would suggest you skip this. Honestly, I only have it because of mylove for the series.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|There may be spoilers...<br /><br />Spoiler number 1:  Bruce Wayne is Batman.<br /><br />After Batman's (Christian Bale) exile as a perceived criminal and murderer of Harvey Dent, Gotham City becomes a relatively safe and peaceful city.  Some of the credit goes to the illusion that Dent was a hero whose legacy included a new law which cracks down on organized crime.  Many of the familiar characters return including Gary Oldman as now Commissioner Gordon, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox and Michael Caine as Alfred.  During this tranquil period of time, the city's underground (literally) is teaming with bad guys, led by a raging bull named Bane (a partially masked Tom Hardy).<br /><br />Bane has captured a device created by billionaire scientist/philantropist/environmentalist Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard) and owned by the Wayne Corporation.  It was developed to help with a cleaner environment but Bruce Wayne mothballed the project as too dangerous given its potential as a nuclear weapon.  Bane provides a demonstration for Gotham's population on a televised football game, showing the device's destructive powers during the game.  Cool CGI which I'm sure most have seen in trailers.<br /><br />Bruce Wayne has become a recluse given Batman's renegade credentials and the death of Rachel.  After Bane and his gang manage to wipe away Wayne's already diminished wealth, Batman rises once again.  In a one-on-one confrontation with Bane, the Bat man finally meets his match.  Imprisoned in a far off gulag, Wayne must once again not only rehabilitate physically but mentally, before his ultimate return.<br /><br />He is aided by a young policeman (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) whose honesty and enthusiasm catch the attention of both Wayne and Commissioner Gordon.  John Blake (Gordon-Levitt) provides much of the intelligence and courage needed in the film and Gordon-Levitt is excellent in the role.  Wayne/Batman also manages to enlist a cat burglar named Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) in the final battle.  Hathaway manages to steal almost every scene she's in and that goes beyond her Catwoman suit.  There are some other wonderful performances.  Christian Bale gets to show a broken side of the Wayne/Batman character.  He's failed and he's lost his true love and struggles to get it together.  Michael Caine's Alfred gets some of his best scenes in the trilogy as he tries to guide and motivate Wayne.  In addition to some tense, exciting scenes filmgoers are treated to a couple big surprises.  See if you can see them coming.al battle.

B000NDI3SK|5.0|In three intense days, I watched, absorbed and synopsized all 13 densely-packed episodes of Jacob Bronowski's THE ASCENT OF MAN (UK-1973).<br /><br />In my entire life I have never learned so much, so fast. As far back as forever it's been my assumption that I can concentrate on and retain ONLY the data and trivia that interests me. Biology, genetics, atomic theory, chemistry and natural science have never been a priority, so I knda slept through those in school. Truth is, I've survived quite well without them, so it's been eye-opening to discover that at this late date not only was I able to stay focused on each of Bronowski's 52 minute illustrated lectures, but their information is even now finding a permanent place in my mental archives. Old dogs CAN learn, apparently.<br /><br />Bronowski explains the phenomenon of human vs. animal learning in the final episode, \\"The Long Childhood.\\"<br /><br />A lab rat, when shown a food treat that's then hidden in one hand will automatically gravitate to that hand for up to several minutes. After that, it doesn't know where the treat is or even that one exists. Bronowski repeated this this experiment with a pre-schooler. He kept the girl amused for about an hour until she said, \\"You're trying to make me forget which hand it's in.\\"<br /><br />Vital to the ascent of our species is this unique ability of facile and immediate retention.<br /><br />What makes THE ASCENT OF MAN so engagingly memorable is Bronowski's skill at motivating viewers to consider a wide variety of subjects that they may have previously dismissed or ignored. If you're a non-science or math type, take the plunge. You may be surprised at how effective the right teacher can be.<br /><br />.<br />The 13-part BBC-Time/Life series THE ASCENT OF MAN (1973) first aired in 1974 ('75 in the US). Host Jacob Bronowski (1/18/08 - 8/22/74)  was a mathematician, biologist, science historian, author, poet and inventor. His clear and interesting commentary throughout these episodes was unscripted and often filled with Bronowski's own opinions and conclusions, thus the series subtitle \\"A Personal View.\\" A near-verbatim transcript (plus stills from the show) [[ASIN:0316109339 THE ASCENT OF MAN - A PERSONAL VIEW]] was published in 1976.<br /><br />.<br />For complete episode synopses, see Comments #1 and #2, located below.episodes was unscripted and often filled with Bronowski's own opinions and conclusions, thus the series subtitle \\"A Personal View.\\" A near-verbatim transcript (plus stills from the show) [[ASIN:0316109339 THE ASCENT OF MAN - A PERSONAL VIEW]] was published in 1976.<br /><br />.<br />For complete episode synopses, see Comments #1 and #2, located below.

B007BVOEPI|2.0|I kept hearing about this show and the hype behind it. I saw the trailer and it looked good.<br />I purchased the season and after watching 5 episodes I was left wondering who is behind the hype?  I kept falling asleep during the episodes.  The main story is \\"okay\\" but each episode there is always a scene of a \\"wise person\\" telling the kids some story about... I have no clue what the heck the 10min stories were about, I kept falling asleep, lol.<br />Seems like this show is for kids 18+ (twilight with gore scenes).  If you liked the latest twilight \\"pregnant\\" movie, then you will love this show.  But if you were bored out of your mind watching mr./mrs. Pregnant chit chat, then I would skip this show.

1423113381|3.0|I was poking around the library recently and ran across this book, which I was drawn to due to my love of the first Percy Jackson novel, and I wanted to see what else Riordan had to offer.  While I can't say I enjoyed this as much as The Lightning Thief, it was still an entertaining book and I'm glad that I read it.<br /><br />It took me awhile to get adjusted to the format this book was written in, which was essentially the story of what Carter and Sadie went through, transcribed from a tape they recorded for someone else to find.  It's a clever concept, but I think I'd like it better in actual audio format as opposed to reading it.  Some of the chapters are told by Sadie, others by Carter, and it was mildly difficult at times to keep track of which one of them is telling the story at which point.  At times, that didn't really matter depending on what was going on, but at other points it was a little more important because of the different skills they each possess.<br /><br />However, I definitely found myself with a bit of irritation while reading this book, and I think it was really with the way the Egyptian gods were handled throughout the story.  A lot of detail concerning ancient Egypt and the entire culture of that civilization was included, but instead of the gods being living beings, they were more spirits that existed in different ways.  I don't want to spoil anything for anyone who intends to read this book, but I'll just leave it by saying I would have preferred them to be more real entities instead of how they were presented.<br /><br />That being said, I am not the target audience for this series and I think I'm bound to have different complaints than the ideal reader.  If I were a pre-teen, I think I would have enjoyed this a lot more than I did as an adult.  It was actually pretty informative, and I learned quite a bit about Egyptian mythology through reading it.  The situations the kids find themselves in are rather harrowing considering their ages and what they are expected to go through in order to preserve the world as they know it.<br /><br />My criticisms aside, I liked the book and I would be curious to read further into the series.  It looks like Riordan has just three books planned for this one, and all are out now.  I only wish the series was intended to go longer, since it would be great to see what Carter and Sadie have in store for them as they transition from being teens to adults.and what they are expected to go through in order to preserve the world as they know it.<br /><br />My criticisms aside, I liked the book and I would be curious to read further into the series.

He Made The Whole World Laugh and Cry!<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. captures the essence of comic genius Charlie Chaplin in a compelling, nuanced performance that earned him an OSCAR® and a Golden Globe® nominations for Best Actor. Director Sir Richard Attenborough's well-crafted portrait traces Charlie Chaplin's impoverished London upbringing, extraordinary success as an actor and director, his troubled marriages, scandalous affairs, shocking exile to Switzerland and his triumphant return to Hollywood. The huge star-studded cast includes Kevin Kline, Dan Aykroyd, Milla Jovovich, Diane Lane and Geraldine Chaplin (as her own grandmother), and Robert Downey, Jr.'s astonishing mimicry of Charlie Chaplin's gait, gestures and accents complete a dazzlingly authentic portrait of one of cinema's first pop culture icons.<br /><br />FILM FACT: Academy Awards® Nominated: Best Actor for Robert Downey Jr. Nominated: Best Original Score for John Barry.

Robert Downey Jr. does a really excellent job at re-creating Charlie Chaplin's graceful slapstick and getting inside the silent-film superstar's head over many years of triumph, defeat, scandal, official persecution, exile, and inner peace.<br /><br />The film is packed with stars in small roles, as everyone plays second banana to Charlie Chaplin, especially Marisa Tomei, Milla Jovovich, David Duchovney, Dan Akroyd, Moira Kelly, and Geraldine Chaplin, just to name a few. The period accuracy is well done, and the acting is superb and just shows more of Charlie Chaplin doing what he does best in making people laugh! But of course it all showed the negative side when you see James Woods as a prosecutor working hard to nail Charlie Chaplin for anti-American sentiments and making Charlie Chaplin pay $75.00 a week in a paternity case.<br /><br />To his credit, Sir Richard Attenborough shows `CHAPLIN' as the social activist who had an FBI files, close to 2,000 pages in length. The drama, at times, seemed a bit much for someone known for bringing joy to so many... perhaps, therein lays the irony of Chaplin's life. Seeing this film makes you appreciate why Charlie Chaplin was a genius, especially seeing Robert Downey, Jr. in top form in this Oscar nominated performance and ode to one of cinema's greatest artists who was the forerunner for such &#34;control freaks&#34; as Warren Beatty and Orson Wells. Writer, director, actor, producer, editor... Charlie Chaplin did it all!<br /><br />As expected from a Sir Richard Attenborough film, ‘CHAPLIN’ boasts strong production values. The editing and camerawork are smooth. There's a wonderful &#34;life imitates art&#34; scene where Charlie Chaplin is being chased by the police, and this couldn't have been better composed. The aging effects are some of the best I've seen. When Charlie Chaplin is old, he looks like he's being played by an elderly actor, not Robert Downey Jr. under a mountain of makeup. Veteran composer John Barry's score, while perhaps too reminiscent of his ‘Dances with Wolves’ music, is evocative. All-in-all, however, even though ‘CHAPLIN’ is fitfully entertaining, it fails to touch enough emotional chords to make it of more than passing interest.<br /><br />Blu-ray Video Quality – The Blu-ray appears to be derived from the same transfer used for the LIONSGATE 2008 inferior NTSC DVD. The greater resolution afforded by Blu-ray is something of a revelation. In the earlier scenes in England, detail is noticeably improved and colour delineation is superior. You can make out individual faces in images such as the music hall and vaudeville audiences, as well as different articles of clothing in medium shots. But overall the picture remains soft and sometimes almost mushy, and one begins to worry that perhaps the transfer was flawed in a way that DVD's resolution concealed. When Charlie Chaplin steps off the train at Mack Sennett's studio, and snap! The entire photographic style changes. Without calling too much attention to themselves (without, in other words, looking like a Tony Scott or Michael Bay film), images become crisp and finely detailed, and the colours become subtly brighter and less faded. Charlie Chaplin may not know it yet, but he's just taken the step that will change his life, and Sven Nykvist's cinematography registers the transformation. Until now, the film hasn't been available in a home video format capable of fully presenting this transition, which registers unconsciously, unless you're looking for it. Black levels are excellent, and check out those tuxedos, and the film's grain structure appears to be intact and unreduced. Having been completed in an era before digital intermediates were standard practice, the film has been transferred from an analogue source, and close attention reveals the occasional &#34;pulsing&#34; instability caused by gate weave. However, this is minor and will probably not be noticed by most viewers.<br /><br />Blu-ray Audio Quality – When I viewed the previous inferior NTSC DVD, I was impressed with the improvements caused by matrix-encoding the 2.0 Dolby Digital track. At the time, I didn't think CHAPLIN's soundtrack could be improved short of a discrete remix from original elements. I stand corrected. The DTS and the 2.0 track on the Blu-ray gives John Barry's haunting score an increased presence and musicality that adds to the film's emotional weight. However, I recommend playing the track through front left and right speakers only, the track tended to &#34;bleed&#34; into the surrounds more than I found desirable. As always with such matters, individual tastes and listening spaces will vary. Dialogue remains clear, as has generally been the case with ‘CHAPLIN.’ Surround effects are not a significant factor with this film.<br /><br />Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: The only real Negative aspect of this excellent Blu-ray is that the extras are shown in the most ridiculous aspect, as you get this small image at the top left hand part of my flat screen Television and I don't know what idiot who produced this ludicrous nonsense and thought it was at all very clever, but to me it is totally ridiculous and I cannot understand why other peoples Reviews have NOT pointed out this ridiculous situation, as I feel it has spoiled what is otherwise an excellent film on ‘CHAPLIN' and again I don't know how LIONSGATE thought this was a professional job, in fact it was a very unprofessional crass action.<br /><br />Includes 3 documentaries plus a rare home movie of Charlie Chaplin:<br /><br />Special Feature: &#34;All at Sea&#34; home movie of Charlie Chaplin vacationing in Catalina, California [1080p] [2:27] Rare home movie footage from 1933, shot by Alistair Cooke, then a college student, on Chaplin's boat.

It is, however, the home of one of the best biopic acting performances out there. Robert Downey Jr. is a fantastic Charlie Chaplin, and watching him recreate the classic, most memorable scenes. Despite slight negative aspects of this Blu-ray, it is still an excellent film and another aspect that is wrong about this Blu-ray disc is that Amazon on both sides of the Atlantic, says that it is just one Region, well I can tell you that information is totally wrong, as it is as stated on the Back Cover that it is All Regions.

B0026FCNK2|5.0|I really enjoyed 12 Monkeys. The story was definitely SciFi and I liked the mystery aspects in the film. Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt both had amazing performances. It had some funny moments that didn't feel forced, as well. The music was also amazing. More importantly, this movie kept my attention throughout because it's very interesting and was well paced. It did get confusing at times, though, but it wasn't a significant issue.<br /><br />I highly recommend 12 Monkeys. If you have Netflix Streaming as of 7/21/12, if you want to save some money, though I recommend a purchase.<br /><br />This film has violence, blood, and nudity.

B003YL4LYI|2.0|I came late the this series so I have had the ability to read all five books in a short time span. I loved the first three and enjoyed the last book but when the author split the books and decided to leave out the Pov's of central character until Dance he did a disservice to the reader. I invested hours and hours to finally see the story advance and Cersi finally getting a taste of her own medicine; then Dance comes along and the story goes backward. While I like a lot of these characters I just do not care because we already know what happens<br />I am plodding through the book and it is well written; although as other reviews pointed out it is very long winded and could use editing. I just do not care what each person ate for every single meal!  I feel especially bad for those that waited 6 years and then received a book that went backwards. It feels like being cheated a little. It seems as if GRmm doesn't know where he is heading and is stalling until he figures it out. That is how I feel so far about this book; it is one very long stall.  Now that I have caught up the series I doubt I will be anxious for the next book.
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|I wish all politicians and corporate leaders will read Why Nations Fail. In my opinion it is approximately the same reasons when corporations fail, so this is a book for most people. We need a fair rule of law valid for everyone the same way, freedom to think, speak and be listened to, freedom and courage to try new ideas and new ways to do and make things. It may sound easy but it is obviously very difficult because so few make use of the success philosophy which has proven its superiority. Why nations fail conveys a message of hope: It is possible!<br /><br />Read this book. It will broaden your mind and give you many interesting pieces of conversation to share with family, friends and colleagues. Few people know that Uzbekistan may be the worst of all countries in the world - and everyone knows that the competition is hard in that league.

0765316994|1.0|Boy, did I want to like this novel. Scalzi comes up with the coolest concept in the world, and then can't bail on it fast enough.<br /><br />The lower crewmen on an Enterprise-like starship begin to realize they're always the first to die on the ship's endless series of insanely dangerous away missions. That's a killer concept.<br /><br />But then the characters all *realize* they're in some sort of work of fiction. Apparently some television show being written here in 2010 is *creating* their future universe. [How? Don't hold your breath waiting to find out: it's simply taken as fact that all works of fiction create parallel universes.]<br /><br />That's not enough: the characters then travel from their parallel universe back to *our* 2010 to meet the show's head writer [in essence, their god], and even interact with the doppelganger-actors playing them on the show. Calling out time travel as a sloppy band-aid, employed only when a show is out of ideas, as the book does, is not an excuse for using it. While the situation does bring up interesting concepts: Every scene filmed for the show becomes a real situation in the future; Every motion the actor goes through in 2010 becomes a life choice for the future version of their character. But none of these things are addressed: everyone instantly accepts that this is just how things work. Instead we're all too busy hitting the beats of a convoluted plot to stop the show from being written, among other things.<br /><br />It's hard to get attached to anyone. There's honestly no way of differentiating between them [Who am I following? Jasper? Dahl? Hester? Duvall? Finn? How can I tell? There's no way of knowing].<br /><br />The whole thing ends abruptly...until you realize there are three -- THREE -- more endings. I will admit, I could not get through these. They seemed beyond indulgent, the final stamp of bad planning. And the book had lost me hundreds of pages ago.<br /><br />There's still a great book out there that takes on this idea. This ain't it.

B007XNAQPG|5.0|The first thing I noticed was the direction and editing which was fabulous!  I liked how they scanned the crowd, mixed in video and focused on the band.  Some of these live DVDs it looks like they have one camera focused in on the band with once and awhile scanning the crowd.<br /><br />They skipped Michigan USA for this tour which was upsetting-every time they were in town I would go see them.  Simons voice sounded so fresh and new like he was 20 years old again.<br /><br />I liked how they focused on the new material also-their latest cd All You Need Is Now-which was there best in years.  I love the old songs but sometimes they are played to death.  My two favories the Man Who Stole the Leopard and Safe were great.  Was hoping they would have played my favorite from the new cd Mediteranea-which brought me to tears everytime I hear it.<br /><br />Still worth the price to see this excellent band who shows that they are not dead yet!<br /><br />5 out of 5 stars.
0345803485|1.0|Totally ridiculous book. Not even erotic.......just a silly girl and a man........discovery can be wonderful but she was just a jerk. If you are looking for an erotic novel.....don't waste your $$$ on this.
0425263908|1.0|I can't believe this book. I have read the Fifty Shades Series and although I can't say the writing was great but it sure beat Bared To You. The characters in BTY were so cold and crude. As soon as they were trying to discuss something intimate or something that should be tender between them (Gideon and Eva) one of them would use such disgusting profanity that I would lose the connection that I should have had with the character. I'm not a prude and I don't think using certain words in certain times are bad but when you're trying to tell the woman in your life that she drives you mad with passion and you can't live without her followed by how sweet her \\"c**t\\" is, then there's a problem.  I totally agree with MariRockN with everything she says. I love to read. I have read many books which are boring or not well written and the only reason I finished Bared To You was to see how ridiculous it could get. I certainly will not be reading the second or the third of this series. Don't waste your time with this book.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love this series.  It is extremely imaginative and detailed in a way that doesn't explain absolutely everything.  Many things are left undiscussed because it wouldn't occur to the characters that it had to be.  I felt connected to the story and the people in it in such a way that I felt their anxiety with them.<br />This isn't as much of a story read as a story shared.  People are going to go nuts over this.

B004LWZWGA|5.0|As someone of the unpopular minority who didn't like Christopher Nolan's previous Batman film 'The Dark Knight' (but really liked 'Batman Begins') I find 'The Dark Knight Rises' a pleasant surprise. It carries a lot of the elements of the first two films, especially TDK's darker tone but manages to off-set it's self-seriousness with a strong story, terrific action-scenes and characters I wanted to root for!<br /><br />The story of 'The Dark Knight Rises' takes place eight years after the events of 'The Dark Knight' Gotham Ciy is seemingly crime free and the Batman hasn't been seen since (still wanted as a fugitive after the events of TDK). In steps Bane: a super-strong, methodical terrorist leader intent on destroying Gotham and ends up forcing Batman/Bruce Wayne out of retirement. There's a lot of elements at work in this dynamic story (taking obvious influences from the Batman comics Knightfall, No Man's Land and Dark Knight Returns) and the movie's almost 3-hour length is felt, but Nolan's strong directing and script manage to bring it all together and he keeps things moving at a brisk pace.<br /><br />As much as I like the story in 'The Dark Knight Rises' it's the characters I found myself most vested in. Regular greats Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman return as Jim Gordan and Lucius Fox, while Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays honest cop John Blake and Anne Hathaway the thief Selina Kyle (each giving the film both an every-person to follow and moments of comic-relief). Marion Cotillard gives protagonist Bruce Wayne a business partner as well as a love-interest in Miranda Tate. Tom Hardy doesn't make Bane as memorable as Heath Ledger's Joker (no one could) but he's an imposing presence and a terrific foil to Batman in terms of strength and ingenuity.<br /><br />All the characters in 'The Dark Knight Rises' have a chance to shine, especially in their personal journey's and relationships but the one holding it all together is Bruce Wayne/Batman himself. It's fun seeing Batman  drive through the dark in the Bat-Pod, stealthily take down criminals from ceilings and dodge gun-fire between muzzle-flashes. Watching a middle-aged and physically impaired Bruce Wayne build himself back up (especially after a nasty beat-down from Bane) is almost as awesome as watching him become Batman for the first time! Christian Bale's amazing performance sells this character in every scene and I especially liked how his relationship with his Butler Alfred played out (an equally compelling Michael Caine with much more screen time). This is the hero I wanted in the first two films!<br /><br />While the direction is sharp and the story exciting, 'The Dark Knight Rises' does have some obvious faults. Hans Zimmer's musical-score is strong as ever but the film's sound kept drowning-out character's dialogue, even during some key moments; Bane's voice-box really didn't help matters either. Nolan's usual self-seriousness is also most apparent in this film, and while the dialogue is less artificial this time around (with much more humor) the movie still got a bit heavy-handed.<br /><br />Even with it's short-comings 'The Dark Knight Rises' is an original and exciting superhero epic. Most fans will probably still favor 'The Dark Knight' as the best of Nolan's trilogy but I'm just glad TDKR is such a great conclusion.man  drive through the dark in the Bat-Pod, stealthily take down criminals from ceilings and dodge gun-fire between muzzle-flashes.

B008M34INW|1.0|In my opinion this is a bad movie because it bored me.  But if you enjoyed it I am happy for you.  I expect several rabid responses to this review written by people who do not understand that a review is another person's opinion ( i.e. not your opinion) about something.  You can ignore or disagree with my opinion but you cannot change it because it is mine.  You can, however, write your own review extolling (look it up) the virtues of this movie and persuade someone else who may not find it boring to see it.
B004WR125O|4.0|Worked like it should once I had everything setup but that wasn't the easiest thing to do with a secured network.<br />- adapter has no options for connecting a wireless network that is not broadcasting its SSID<br />- second the only way to get the MAC address is to use menu options on the receive which is not a big deal except it only gives you the wired network adapter MAC address until you connect it to a WIFI network then it will give you the wireless MAC address. So you have to greatly reduce your security for a short amount of time in order for this to connect.
0062059882|4.0|I am nowhere near as familiar with Gaiman's work as I should be, and this is my first shot at his adult fiction. I have to admit that, fifty pages in, I was fairly convinced that I wouldn't like it, especially after talking to someone who only made it a bit further than that before giving up. As it turns out, it just took a while for me to get what Gaiman was trying to do with this book.<br /><br />The book centers on Shadow, a hulking, pensive man who is fond of coin tricks and has just served a short prison stint for assault. Through what appears to be the cruel vagaries of fate, Shadow finds himself with nowhere to go and nobody waiting for him when he is released, except for an odd man named Wednesday, who just might be a down-on-his-luck god. The rest of the story is basically one long road trip across America's heartland, punctuated by a jumbled pastiche of cameos by the ragged remnants of once-almighty deities, as Shadow works under Wednesday to rally an army against the supposedly imminent attack of the glittering, frantic, materialistic new gods of America.<br /><br />This book starts out with a little preamble and lot of moroseness, and the otherworldly elements are kicked off by an oddly placed erotic chapter that gets extremely weird very quickly. It takes a bit of fortitude to process the first few chapters, and to accept that the plot largely consists of rising action once you get past them. Indeed, the climax is so literally anti-climactic that it will definitely be the last straw for any reader who is still on the fence at that point. Fortunately for me, I was wholly enjoying myself by the time I got to the end. American Gods is just like the Americana road trip that Shadow takes: an aimless journey across a landscape dotted with bizarre curiosities. Journeys like that have no real \\"point,\\" except to make one ponder the loneliness of decades-old tourist traps, and wonder at the power they still have to make a traveler stop and stare.<br /><br />I read the tenth anniversary edition, which included scenes that Gaiman edited out of the original publication. I enjoyed all of the various visits and confrontations that Shadow endures throughout the story, but I have a feeling these bonus scenes contributed to the occasionally sluggish pace of the book. This edition also included Gaiman's ruminations on being a Brit that has the gall to write a book about American folklore, which are both amusing and illuminating.<br /><br />It's hard to categorize this book, which can be observed by reading the list of awards it has won: the Hugo, Locus, Nebula, and Bram Stoker, among others. It's a little bit fantasy, a little bit horror, a little bit literary fiction, and more than a little bit strange. Ultimately, though, I found myself unwilling to put it down, and I found myself in a thoughtful mood for a few days after I finished, both of which are good signs. I'd recommend it to anybody who has a craving for something that's simultaneously familiar and ethereal.d the tenth anniversary edition, which included scenes that Gaiman edited out of the original publication.

B007X4ECLY|5.0|This is a great fun movie.  Scenes provide action, then laughs, more action, more laughs.  Definitely in the B Sci-Fi category, but lots of fun if you like movies that take place in the future.  Definitely a mix of Escape from New York with Die Hard and Mad Max, plus a bit of the Boondock Saints.<br /><br />Forgive the chase scene on the road with its PC-game graphics, and the obvious Star Wars drop the bomb in the tunnel scene, and forgive a few of the missing frames to help finish the thought...these errors move so fast, you don't dwell on them before the next action and laughs have you distracted.  Sort of like the crew spent all their attention on the first half, and the second half was sort of filmed while hung-over after the party.<br /><br />I didn't expect to like it; thought my kids would love it.  Turned out, we all loved it.  The lines our hero says are simply awesome fun.  More than worth $20 for the family to stay in and watch the movie on disc.

B0002IQNAG|5.0|Filmmaker George Romero may not be able to claim that he created the \\"zombie\\",but it can almost be said that he created the \\"zombie movie\\",taking it away from its Haitian Creole roots and,borrowing from Richard Matheson's \\"I Am Legend\\",created a surreal tale of a race of hellish monsters emerging to prey upon late 20th-century America in his 1968 film \\"Night Of The Living Dead\\".Then,just ten years later,he re-invented his own creation in his \\"Dawn Of The Dead\\",combining an abundance of unabashed violent bloodshed,still a rarity in American cinema at the time,with on-target satire of the modern consumer culture.Needless to say,this movie quickly became an icon of horror movies.<br />For anyone interested in Everything You've Ever Wanted To Know About \\"Dawn Of The Dead\\" And Weren't Afraid To Ask,this 4-disc set from Anchor Bay Entertainment will not disappoint.In addition to the original theatrical release,there is also an extended director's cut,the European version(which,admittedly,only slightly differs),two insightful documentaries,behind-the-scenes footage,posters and lobby cards,commercials and theatrical trailers....even a late-70's commercial for the mall where much of the movie takes place....if you are indeed a true fan of \\"Dawn Of The Dead\\"...you WANT this.

B00004Y6O7|2.0|This album alone proves how delusional Roth-era fans really are.  VH and VH2, as well as 1984, are fantastic and deserve all  of the praise they receive.  But this is not the masterpiece that fans claim it is.<br /><br />\\"Mean Streets\\" begins with an excellent guitar session by Eddie, then leads into a powerful, if somewhat generic, guitar riff.  The song is pretty good, but it does not maintain energy throughout it's entirety.  I had the same first impression of \\"Hear About It Later\\" .  I enjoyed the listen, though I always lose interest at done point.<br /><br /> Then there is the excellent \\"Unchained\\" which really needs no explanation.  \\"Sultan's Swing\\" is somewhat amusing, but has a completely obnoxious chorus and is worth skipping on most occasions.<br /><br /> That concludes all  that is noteworthy about this album.  But that is not enough of a criticism of the remaining tracks.  They are completely mediocre.  Some of the worst work the band has done in any era.<br /><br />Dark, cheesy, and lifeless describes the majority of the album.  Even in the bargain bin you are sure to encounter this album in, it would be better just to download \\"Unchained\\" and maybe \\"Mean Streets\\" and remember this album for the few high points, not the abundant lows.

B0086700CM|4.0|First off, this is a great game. It's a nice time waster with a simple concept. You are given a small tutorial, and then given some quests. You run until you die and you can use coins you got for cool upgrades. Nice. The game is a bit blocky, (looks like N64 rendering) and the textures are a bit okay. Enough with that. Let's move on.<br /><br />The game is now laggy, and it seems as if the terrian is flashing. Please fix this, because it's quite distracting.<br />Thank you, and goodbye. :)

B007QXU0ZO|5.0|Up From Below vs. Here: I read an interview with Alex Ebert in which he said that on the first album (Up from below) he felt they were sort of \\"trying too hard\\", while on this one the band really came together and they had the courage to \\"let the songs breathe\\". I couldn't agree more and could not have said it better! \\"Here\\" is an awesome album that demands a few spins around the CD player/turntable to appreciate (I was hooked at the 2nd time) and you will find that it is much better than \\"Up From Below\\". I bought both of them and I think that songs # 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 on \\"Up From Below\\" are standard fare that many of these winy-sounding bands churn out these days (Arcade Fire, Wolf Parade and so on). I mixed all my favourite Sharpe songs on one CD and ended up using all songs from \\"Here\\", but only #s 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 12, 13 from \\"Up From Below\\" made the cut. These songs are great, have some grittiness, and with 7 out of 13 one should be quite happy these days: these guys are awesome! Yet, \\"Here\\" is much better because the songs are smoother and more complex, are more richly arranged, and the recordings are MUCH better. You probably won't be able to appreciate this on a measly MP3 player where half your data is lost, but on serious equipment (CD player playing WAV or turntable playing vinyl, with a good amp and speakers), you can hear all the instruments individually or together, depending on what you focus on. There is no lame song on \\"Here\\" - the whole album belongs together, and 9 out of 9 is a great loot. \\"Here\\" rewards if you listen more closely and it gives back more as well - it's fully grown music. If you have some practice listening to jazz, classical music, enjoy the sing-along style of Aquarius (Hair), and the song-writing of Leonard Cohen or Neil Diamond, Ray Davies (Kinks), the Doors - I was even reminded of Cat Stevens' voice at some places - you will have a lot of fun with \\"Here\\". The way these guys/girls pay homage to the past, yet create their very own sound, is breathtaking and a lot of fun. Some reviewers have complained there are no hits on \\"Here\\". I would say that \\"Man on Fire\\" is just as good as \\"Home\\", if not better. I never heard of Edward Sharpe & Co, saw them on Letterman doing \\"Man on Fire\\", rushed online to check them out, and became a fan instantly.
B00712Y28Q|5.0|In the year 1986 Japanese gamers were treated to a special gem of a game called Metroid. The following year Metroid landed on North American shores and set the gaming world on fire. Here was a game which shattered the \\"traditional\\" style of games which were available at the time; a game where the characters can move both left and right!? A side-scrolling action / adventure which allows players to return to the beginning of the game whenever they wanted to? A game full of wonderful creatures, menacing boss characters, and truly alien environments which encouraged the player to explore every nook and cranny of the game world. Yes, Nintendo really broke the mold with Metroid, and gamers all around the world were eating it up.<br /><br />Fast forward five long years to 1991 and again players are invited to indulge their senses in Metroid II for the uber-popular Nintendo hand-held: Game Boy. By this time, the franchise had built a large and loyal fan base, and Nintendo was quick to realize the potential in the Metroid property. Hats, mugs, key-chains, t-shirts, stickers, and posters started to spread about and adorned many a kids bedroom walls and school notebooks. Sadly, there were no action figures of our heroine anywhere to be seen. Samus would have to wait another three long years for her action figure debut.<br /><br />In 1994 Super Metroid was released for the red-hot Super Nintendo and instantly rocketed to the top of the charts. Once again Nintendo struck gold with a game that reinvented the adventure / exploration genre and garnered accolades from critics and fans alike. Finally Nintendo took note and licensed Samus' likeness to an up and coming toy company called Joyride Studios. Samus Aran was given the action figure treatment at long last............... but something was a bit off. The figure, while a good representation of Samus as she appears in Super Metroid, was poorly designed. Little in the way of articulation and paint applications held this figure back from being great. I still love this version of Samus, and at the time, this figure was all we had to choose from, so by default, it was awesome.<br /><br />Eight, count 'em, EIGHT grueling years later Nintendo finally releases information on two new entries into the Metroid franchise: Metroid Prime and Metroid Fusion. Metroid Fusion looks like a game the fans are accustomed to. It has a side-scrolling exploration and a familiar, albeit different looking, heroine in Samus. But what really set the gaming world ablaze was the talk of a FIRST-PERSON Metroid game being developed by an outside company for the Nintendo GameCube! How could this happen?? Why did Nintendo have to destroy the Metroid legacy this way?? Many fans worried, but in the end, many fans were dead-wrong to worry. Metroid Prime once again elevated the franchise to record heights and utterly obliterated the mold that had held the series in it's iron grasp. Metroid Prime is not only one of the greatest Metroid games of all time, it is one of the greatest games ever made, period. With Prime's release the floodgates were opened and a deluge of Metroid titles poured out. Metroid: Zero Mission (2004), Metroid Prime 2: Echoes (2004), Metroid Prime Pinball (2005), Metroid Prime Hunters (2006), Metroid Prime 3: Corruption (2007), and finally Metroid: Other M in the year 2010.<br /><br />While not the greatest Metroid title in the series, Other M reintroduced gamers to the classic side-scrolling gameplay while maintaining some of Prime's first-person elements. It is Metroid: Other M to which we, the action figure junkies, owe a debt of gratitude. For this is the title which prompted Max Factory to include Samus Aran in their Figma line of collectible action figures!<br /><br />Without a doubt this figure has everything a fan could ask for in an action figure based on one of gaming most iconic characters. The sculpting is impeccable. Every detail of Samus' armor is realized in pitch-perfect detail. From the over-sized shoulder pads to the booster-pack on her back, no expense was spared. The weight of the figure is a testament to it's high quality production. Once you get her in your hands, you instantly know that you've invested your money very wisely.<br /><br />The paint applications on the Samus Figma are a sight to behold. Bright golds and reds cover her armor with a brilliant metallic sheen, and a beautiful green draws attention to her arm-cannon. The helmet visor is a piece of figure-ingenuity. The green on her faceplate almost glows thanks to a transparent clear \\"shield\\" which covers the length of the visor; truly a work of art.<br /><br />Articulation, while hard to believe in a Samus figure, is the Figma standard. There is almost no pose in which you can't put Samus. The points of articulation allow for an insane amount of poseability, all while keeping the joints brilliantly hidden from view. I thought it couldn't be done, but Max Factory has built a Samus figure which can duplicate poses from the most iconic images of Samus that we've seen throughout the years. This fact alone deserves so much recognition.<br /><br />The accessories which accompany Samus are many. Beside the standard Figma stand and bracer-arm, Max Factory has included five extra hands (fist, open palm, 'thumbs up', clasping & gripping), an interchangeable \\"missile\\" fitting for the end of Samus' arm cannon, two variations of blaster fire (one single and one double blast), and the absolute best accessory of all: Samus in morph-ball mode!!! Yes, Max Factory included the version of Samus where she folds into a ball in order to gain entry into tight spaces and lay bombs among other things...... an exceptional extra for an exceptional figure.<br /><br />Finally the package in which Samus arrives in is a sight to behold. Beautiful pictures of the figure decorate the front and sides of the window-box, while on the back we are treated to some of the many possible poses we get to try and emulate. This package does a great job of showing off the vast articulation and extras while maintaining an elegant simplicity. The package itself is collector-friendly, consisting of two inner plastic trays which hold everything in place without the need for cumbersome tape or, gasp, twist-ties. Samus is easy to remove from and return to the package, and displays beautifully in or out.<br /><br />While I am disappointed that Max Factory never got around to releasing my Jonathan Joestar from Jo Jo's Bizarre Adventure in their Figma line, I am in awe of this gorgeous rendition of Samus Aran. And while it is based on a game which might not be everyone's cup-of-tea, the figure itself is pure Samus. It is the one we've all waited for, and now she is here. GO GET HER! NOW!! (Then we can all cross our fingers for a re-paint version of Samus in her Gravity Suit!!!!) If you've held off in the past from other offerings like those from Joyride, First 4, and Nintendo Direct, now would be the time to pick up your very own Samus figure. Trust me, she is worth every penny - and more!-sized shoulder pads to the booster-pack on her back, no expense was spared. The weight of the figure is a testament to it's high quality production.

B0028IDXDS|5.0|I purchased the Wubbanub pacifier over a month ago and wished I bought it sooner.  I absolutely love this pacifier for three reasons.  First, it stays in his mouth unlike his other pacifier that is not attached to any plush toy so it constantly falls out. The monkey makes it perfect for night time comfort where my husband and I don't have to get up every minute to put back in his mouth and hear him cry.  Second, its the same brand pacifier he is use too.  He was given the \\"soothie\\" type of pacifier when he was in the NICU and has been using only this brand since then.  Third, its easy to find if it drops or if you have twins like we do and need to easily distinguish whose is whose: my son has the monkey and my daughter the giraffe.  Although their other pacifiers are colored coded I can't tell you how many times my husband and their grandparents mix those up but they haven't with these.  I still haven't put it in the washer, so I can't comment on its true durablity.  But just for these months this pacifier monkey is worth every penny!

B000K8EQ5W|5.0|I absolutely love this movie!! It has been one of my favorites in the same genre as \\"Somewhere in Time.\\"  I had to purchase it when I saw a edited version on Lifetime TV.  I'm so glad I did.  The subtle performances from Keanu and Sandra made me realize why i liked their first collaboration so much (Although \\"Speed\\" was an adrenaline rush instead of a romantic 'moment in time' rendezvous.)<br />I recommend this film to anyone who has the passion to wait for the 'right' one even if its years from now.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Well to tell you the truth I love Ice Age Village. It's a great game based on the third ice age.
B005LAIGF0|4.0|Basically this movie is about a teenage girl who plays a part in causing a grisly bus accident that kills a women.  The rest of the movie is spent showing how the girl deals with her guilt and confusion in various ways and how it impacts her decisions.  It does a good job of capturing that \\"life goes on\\" feel even when one is in the midst of horrible pain, guilt and indecision about how they should feel and what should they do.  It also shows how relationships can be impacted by a tragic event.  Margaret is ALOT of drama to take so be prepared.  The accident scene is extremely real and as close to what I might imagine an accident like that would really be like without hiding anything or sugar coating it.  Anna Paquin plays the snotty, intelligent, sometimes sweet, sometimes loving, distant, and overly-emotional teenage role to perfection.  One sometimes forgets that teenagers are all these things rolled into one and the complexity of that time in life is captured very well.  It also addresses teenage sexuality and the relationship between a divorced mother with a busy career raising her teenage daughter.  I really liked the reality, no-bs quality of Margaret.  Margaret tries to rectify what has happened but it's true that when something like that does happen, it just seems that whatever you are doing to try and help somehow isn't enough or you're just not sure what is the right thing to do.  Also swirling around the plot is a semi-legal drama about getting the bus driver fired which actually turns into something else that Anna Paquin's character was not expecting.  Admittedly at times I was annoyed with Paquin's aggressive, smart-aleckness and some of the drama was sort of corny, but all in all, this was a very different movie that was somewhat refreshing.  Dare I say something new here?  As most movies repeat old plots.  Bravo for Anna Paquin.  Once again, this is a HUGE dose of drama which might leave you feeling a little done with drama after you watch it - but that's okay. It's worth watching and experiencing something different for awhile.
B003NX76BM|5.0|The story keeps you rivited. You become so involved with the characters and are so much of the story you can't put it down..  I forced myself to read slowly because I love all of Nora Roberts books so much I just didn't want it to ever end...even though you love the ending too!

B0071K5KWU|5.0|I've been a big fan of Genesis since I was a young kid, many, many years ago. I always thought Tony Banks was THE sound of Genesis. His big, dramatic chords and sounds are what Genesis music is all about. Unfortunately, Genesis will never play together again. But, those who love Tony Banks' genius will be delighted to listen to this cd. Mister Banks explores his musical themes from a more classical standpoint. Don't expect guitar solos! Yet, the music is characteristic of Mr Banks' legacy. My suggestion : buy the cd, put it in the cd player of your car and go for an hour long ride listening to it. You will not be disappointed.

B007SYWFRM|1.0|At first, this game was fun and a little addicting. Then I tried getting out and found that you had to press the Stuff button to get to your homepage. I thought that was annoying. But then, when I tried to visit friends, it completely froze my Kindle Fire and I had to restart it. Nevermind the fact that my 5 year old brother bought $60+ worth of coins. It's not only a scam, it's just bad for your device.
B005LAIGSM|1.0|Honestly, it was just lame in my opinion. It was marketed as a Christian movie, which it was not. The storyline just seemed unsteady and like it was missing a lot. From the other reviews I read there was a book and they didn't follow along with it well. Which may be why it seemed sort of angsty and not very good.

B0044FEZBC|4.0|This issue continues the recent series of new Bolshoi Ballet recordings now available in high definition and Blu-ray. This follows a gap of a few years of refurbishment and where recordings have not been made. Suffice it to say that the Bolshoi Ballet has returned on very top form with interesting new productions as well as items of more traditional fare.<br /><br />The current issue is set at the time of the French Revolution and is essentially a story of love formed on either side of the political divide and of human sacrifice in the name of love.<br /><br />There can be no doubt about the mastery of the dancing in this production which is a technical 'tour de force'. The quality of the setting is also effective and makes good use of the large expanses of stage to create spectacle and a strong sense of speed. I personally find the music serviceable rather than of great note - not in the class of Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky or Prokofiev for example to name but three of Russian lineage. It is for these musical considerations rather than those of dance that I have withheld the fifth star. Clearly ballet has to be seen as a whole art form bringing together an amalgamation of dance, music and staging to create a total experience and a reviewer must therefore consider all of these factors when deciding upon a fair grading and this I have attempted to do.<br /><br />Nevertheless, and regardless of the above, it is likely that this issue will be of particular interest to those who are interested in the extraordinarily athletic abilities of the Russian superstar dancer, Ivan Vasiliev. Allegedly he is known to almost fly and indeed he does seem to defy gravity. There is little to add except that he fully lives up to his reputation and will not disappoint. The other three star dancers, Natalia Osipova as Jeanne, Denis Savin as Jerome and Nina Kaptsova are all fine dancers in their own right and the four stars make an impressive team. The corps de ballet are all that one would expect from the revitalised Bolshoi and the supporting solo roles are also good. This is a very impressively danced ballet which is presented with excellent costumes and sets in the finest of Russian traditions.<br /><br />There is an interesting 21 minute bonus featuring interviews, rehearsal sequences and some historical information presented by the choreographer, Ratmansky and the two main dancers, Vasiliev and Osipova. This has subtitles to help with the rehearsal sequences and the dancers however Ratmansky speaks fluent English during his interview extracts.<br /><br />The Blu-ray recording is very successful and delivers crisp and detailed imaging without motion blur even at times of fast action. There is a fine DTS surround sound option supplied as well as stereo. The extra bonus is in the form of 21 minutes of interviews and rehearsal extracts featuring the choreographer Ratmansky and the fine two leading dancers, Osipova and Vasiliev.<br /><br />So in my opinion this earns a clear 5 stars for the dancing, much of which is spectacular, coupled with a fine production which is recorded well and generous bonus. My doubts about the long-term quality of the music is the reason for the reduced level to 4 stars. This is a personal response however and those with more dance-based priorities may well prefer a higher overall grade than me.pect from the revitalised Bolshoi and the supporting solo roles are also good.

B003Y7AR4K|5.0|This is the same Peter Wright choreography as in the previous, much loved, Royal Ballet production of about a decade ago. I, like many others no doubt, was rather hoping that that earlier recording would be transferred to the new Blu-ray medium. That was not to be, but instead we have a brand new recording of the same production, albeit with different or older, dancers to consider. For those interested in the DVD version only please note that Amazon does not allow such a distinction to be made when submitting a review of a disc available in Blu-ray. Please make allowances for that when reading the following and which may well contain useful comment anyway .....<br /><br />As in all re-makes there is a mixture of pluses and negatives. The negatives will be most keenly felt by those who have formed a strong allegiance to the earlier issue of course. The same will no doubt be true of this issue in the fullness of time. As this recording was made during the current run with different lead dancers on different nights there will also be those who would wish the recording had been made on different nights.<br /><br />None of that matters however when considering this new recording as the earlier one is not being transferred to Blu-ray and this is the only recording of this popular production now in its 25th year now available in the new medium. So this disc simply has to be considered entirely on its own merits as a recent example of this particular production. Bemoaning the lack of the previous production as a Blu-ray, or complaining about the choice of cast on this disc as some do are simply irrelevant considerations and not in any way helpful. Offenbach summed up this sort of situation as quoted at the end of this summary review.<br /><br />In my opinion, given the circumstances and choices concerning this disc, it does very well indeed. All the lead parts are well danced technically and they are supported by excellent ensemble work. The magic of the ballet is fully caught and transmitted - one has only to listen to the enthusiastic support of the audience during the performance and the extended and rapturous 7 minutes of curtain calls at the end before the final fade-out to be sure of that.<br /><br />The staging and costumes are both traditional and sumptuous in terms of ballet productions and the narrative is traditional and kind to all. The orchestra, under the direction of Koen Kessels, delivers attentive and high quality playing throughout, and what a fine score Tchaikovsky provided for our enjoyment. Pure musical bliss!<br /><br />The actual recording is well up to the standards of Opus Arte with crisp and well defined visuals which provide a nice balance of close-up detail and panoramic views. The sound is both full and clear and is provided in both DTS-HD and stereo.<br /><br />For me personally, much though I loved the earlier production referred to in the first paragraph, I feel more than compensated for by the many advantages of this new production, not least by the marvellous recording quality. Especially for those fresh to this production therefore, I am sure that 5 stars would seem to be an easily justified assessment. The same might be said for others such as me - I hope so, as in my opinion, it seems to be fully deserving issue and likely to give plenty of pleasure and satisfaction to many future purchasers.<br /><br />As Offenbach advises in La Grande Duchesse 'If you cannot have what you love, then you must love what you have' ....................

030758836X|3.0|*A Brief Note to Readers: If you find this review \\"not helpful\\", please take a moment to tell me why in the comment section. Thank you.*<br /><br />Are you bored, dear reader?  I hope you like a madcap and fiendish ride, because \\"Gone Girl\\" offers it in spades.  This, author Gillian Flynn's third novel (Sharp Objects, Dark Places), is a psychological thriller that illustrates the extremes in human thought and behavior that most of us are too frightened to contemplate.<br /><br />It begins with a disappearance, one that possesses the accouterments of a kidnapping and murder.  Nick Dunne, the husband, is ambivalent about his wife Amy's vanishing - their marriage has been imploding the last few years and he has been looking for a way out.  But when he stumbles upon the clues to a scavenger hunt that Amy has made a tradition of their anniversaries, old affections bubble to the surface.  In over his head, Nick rides a fine line between love and hate while the police search for a possible corpse and decide on him as the prime suspect.<br /><br />The rampant psychopathy Flynn introduces later on is unsettling and all too real.  People like this exist and take prisoners every day, their inscrutable charm and seeming brilliance the shiny hook catching every hungry and gullible fish in the pond.  The iniquity of her characters is complemented by her warped thought processes; her occasional stream-of-consciousness style tangents are the crack in the human psyche, the darkness and depravity within spilling onto the pages.  Both Nick and Amy's voices are frank and immodest, sometimes downright vulgar.  The reader will come to loathe both of them for being long on corruption and short on principles.<br /><br />The mystery/thriller part of Flynn's story is well-plotted, the trail of deception winding and wheeling its way on a steady pace from beginning to end.  But it isn't a \\"taut\\" thriller in the literal sense - it would need about 50 or more pages shaved off to merit that adjective.  Though Flynn is an exceptional writer, some of her passages are a bit much, one in particular featuring Amy describing a \\"Cool Girl\\" persona lengthy and rambling.  She also takes her time building momentum.  The novel has a sluggish start, the first of its three parts laying the track for a crazy train that goes at lightning speed through Part 2 and then derails toward the end.  How it all wraps up takes some suspension of disbelief and the last few pages are limp and unsatisfactory.  The denouement is open-ended and has no palpable resolution, giving it potential to affect a reader's overall verdict. I was torn on whether to award this book 2 or 3 stars for that very reason.  I think people feel cheated by it because Flynn spends the entirety of the novel building an appetite for retribution only to yank that dangling carrot away just as a bite of it seems imminent.<br /><br />In short, \\"Gone Girl\\" failed to meet my expectations.  But Flynn is brilliant.  She is sharp, cynical, delightfully unpredictable, and one-of-a-kind.  The scope of her imagination and her unique voice still put her at the top of my list of favorite authors.  Proceed her work with caution - it is nervy and disquieting, with many more dark places yet to be explored.tive.

B00007GZR5|4.0|In every sense of the word, this is the most romantic movie I can remember. That does not mean it is all sentimental hugs and kisses. It delves darkly into isolation and longing, death and despair; like an extended romantic poem, it presents some intensely subjective visions of a man's relationship to others and to the natural and supernatural worlds. In fact, as director Vincent Ward admits near the end of an excellent commentary track, this is nothing less than a New Age reworking of the ancient legend of Orpheus, who descended into the deepest depths of Hades' realm in hope of finding his beloved wife and restoring her to life and light. In this movie, however, the husband dies first and then begins his quest to be reunited with his love.<br /><br />Any review of this film--and any brief excerpt promoting it--must communicate a sense that it is visually dazzling, finding unprecedented techniques to create properly dreamlike visions of afterlife situations: The characters are immersed in settings vast and brilliant, inspired by a dozen painters from various eras of art history, brushstrokes and all. More surprising, perhaps, is the formidable acting of Annabella Sciorra and especially Robin Williams, communicating a whole palette of nuanced emotions in a noncomic role. (How could anyone complain of a lack of chemistry between them!) The movie's structure is unorthodox, with its strategically positioned, unexpectedly believable flashbacks, and throughout the journey, Michael Kamen's lush orchestral score sweeps us onward, adding hugely to the emotional experience. The surround sound is likewise spectacular.<br /><br />The weak link, if any, is the script. At best, it is properly unpredictable and sometimes exquisitely crafted (as in Chris's eulogy at the funeral of his teenage son). At other times it becomes unnecessarily vulgar or takes a few steps toward pretentiousness, which means that some viewers may be pardoned for finding individual moments off-putting or vaguely silly. All the same, we feel a bit cheated when an occasional line is hard to hear clearly on first viewing--for instance, because of Max von Sydow's accent. Though his relatively brief performance as a rather grumpy spiritual \\"tracker\\" is too understated and matter-of-fact for my taste, old von Sydow does get one of the best moments, when he dramatically warns our hero that the real danger of Hell is not physical torment but losing one's sanity and, by implication, one's soul. And if this film succeeds in provoking some fresh thoughts and feelings about all our preconceptions regarding life after death, surely that in itself is a triumph.<br /><br />As a bonus feature, the DVD includes an early, alternative version of the movie's final two scenes (with their postproduction aspects not fully polished). I have a slight preference for this original ending, though I might have left its last two minutes on the cutting-room floor. While it presents a different, more explicit, more complex picture of what lies ahead for the two soul mates, it does not drastically change the feeling or message of the movie. We might also recognize that the theatrically released ending, though sometimes dismissed as overly \\"cute,\\" does a neater job of bringing the story full circle.<br /><br />(There is one slight problem with the DVD, as both the trailers and the alternative ending have been vertically squeezed to an aspect ratio of nearly 3:1, making the actors appear fatter than they are. By contrast, the feature film is presented with an aspect ratio a bit narrower than the advertised 2.35:1, making us wonder whether the extreme left and right edges of the image have been chopped off.)<br /><br />At a time when virtually every Hollywood product steals ideas from countless films that came before, _What Dreams May Come_ is genuinely original and unique, not to say profoundly beautiful. It may appeal to the same audience as other modern \\"love stronger than death\\" movies such as _Defending Your Life_ and _Just Like Heaven_, yet it is more serious and far more ambitious in its aims than those two. Connoisseurs of classic international cinema may observe some thematic connections with the works of Jean Cocteau, or may note that Vincent Ward and his team capture some of Powell and Pressburger's creative excitement about exploiting Technicolor in the service of a surreal spirit. More simply, _What Dreams May Come_ does what movies ought to do but rarely achieve: instead of merely telling a story, it helps us see the world in a new way, through *moving* visual images that no other medium could so effectively present.<br /><br />[Now can someone please explain why the closing credits include a credit for \\"Russian folk music research\\"?]
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is simply amazing. I had heard raving reviews about it from friends for months prior to reading it, and it certainly lived up to, and exceeded, expectations. Before reading The Fault in Our Stars, I read two of John Green's other books, Paper Towns and An Abundance of Katherines. Without having read Looking for Alaska yet, I absolutely think this is John's best work. I felt for the characters and was immersed in this world, shown from the interesting perspective of a teenager with cancer. She experiences a mix of depression, realism, hopefulness, and optimism throughout the story. The characters, situations, and story itself pose intriguing and insightful ideas. I didn't want to stop reading it. I feel very grateful to have read this novel, and would recommend it to anyone.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Once I read the first one, I had to read all three.  Yes, there is a lot of sex; but the books do have other action as well, I found myself very captivated.  I really enjoyed the books - and I almost venture to say that the books have somehow brought new level to certain things; new perspectives, - not a bad thing at all ;) -- However, if you dont like things spelled out, then this book is not for you.  I will admit, I blushed a lot even reading the book at home alone.  I loved her Goddess and Ego; cute characters.  After reading the trilogy I can certainly see my Goddess and Ego much more clearly, and I like them!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book was really good. Some might say his character was too perfect... Not at all. A little internal struggle, sex, and desire. All in good fun. Enjoy.
B002SAUCBC|2.0|I powered through this one expecting at least something for a payoff. But nothing really happened to make it seem worthwhile. My first King and likely my last...not sure what the hype for this guy is about. Must be a generational thing. Reminds me of watching a B movie from the eighties.
B00005N6KG|1.0|I ordered this unit on May 12 of this year (2012). It is now July 21 and I am having to buy more headphones as the wire, down next to the plug, has broken on one side and I can only hear both channels if I HOLD the wire in a certain position. The sound was quite acceptable, they are nice and lightweight, and the over-the-head band was EASILY held in place with a ball cap. But they are just too fragile for me to be able to recommend them.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love play this game. and my grandchildren love it as well. I have told my friends about the game and love playing it as well.
